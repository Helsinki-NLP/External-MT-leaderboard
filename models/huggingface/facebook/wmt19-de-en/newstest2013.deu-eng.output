A Republican Strategy to Confront Obama's Re-Election
Republican leaders justify their policies on the basis of the need to combat voter fraud.
But the Brennan Center believes the latter is a myth, asserting that voter fraud is rarer in the US than the number of people killed by lightning.
Republican attorneys, incidentally, have recorded only 300 cases of electoral fraud in the United States in 10 years.
One thing is certain: these new rules will have a negative impact on voter turnout.
In this sense, these measures are partly undermining the US democratic system.
Unlike Canada, US states are responsible for holding elections in individual states.
In this sense, since 2009, the majority of American governments have promulgated new laws that make the process of registering or voting more difficult.
This phenomenon gained importance after the November 2010 elections, in which 675 new Republican representatives were registered in 26 states.
As a result, 180 bills restricting the exercise of voting rights in 41 states were introduced in 2011 alone.
The new election laws require voters to show photo identification and proof of U.S. citizenship.
In addition, these laws also shorten the periods for early voting, invalidate the right to register as a voter on election day and deny the right to vote to citizens for whom a court record exists.
Before the 2006 election, no US state required voters to show photo identification.
Indiana was the first state to make such a request.
In 2008, the United States Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of the Indiana law.
Republican officials were quick to extend the practice to other states.
Over the past two years, they sponsored bills in 34 states that would force voters to show photo identification.
It is important to note that, unlike Quebec, US citizens do not have a universal identity card like the health insurance card.
In fact, 11% of US citizens, or 21 million eligible voters, do not have a photo ID issued by a government agency in their state.
Moreover, five million new voters in 2012 did not have such a card.
However, more than a hundred dollars are often required to obtain the required ID.
Young people, minorities and people with low incomes are disproportionately affected by the new restrictions.
In fact, 25% of African-Americans, 15% of those earning less than $35,000, 18% of citizens over 65, and 20% of voters between 18 and 29 do not have the required photo ID.
This goes further than that.
Students, who are seen as voters who are increasingly casting ballots for Democratic candidates, are not allowed to use photo identification issued by their institution in several states.
On the other hand, those same states allow members of fishing or hunting clubs who vote more for the Republican side to use the electoral cards issued by those clubs.
Before 2004, no state required proof of citizenship to vote.
Arizona was the first state to introduce such a requirement.
Since 2011, a dozen states have passed laws requiring voters to prove their US citizenship.
These measures are clearly aimed at limiting the Hispanic vote.
For it is clear that two out of three Hispanic voters favor the Democratic Party.
In addition, Republican lawmakers sponsored legislation in eight states in 2011 that eliminated voter registration on Election Day.
In addition, you have limited the right of individuals and groups to assist those voters who wish to register.
These restrictions are not without consequences.
For example, voter registration campaigns in the 2004 general election helped to register around 10 million citizens.
The measures adopted since 2009 have reduced the share of new voters registering in 2010 by 17% compared to 2006.
In addition, Republican lawmakers in five other states have passed legislation aimed at shortening the early voting period.
For example, in the 2008 Florida general election, 33% of voters who voted in advance were African-American, though they accounted for only 13% of the state's voters.
The same is true of the Hispanic population.
The latter accounted for only 11% of voters, but 24% of citizens who voted in advance.
By contrast, whites, who made up 76% of the electorate, accounted for only 46% of voters who voted in advance.
Of course, Democratic legislators and their supporters have vigorously opposed the passage of laws restricting voter registration.
Several bills were blocked by the vetoes of Democratic governors.
The US attorney general has intervened to suspend the most controversial laws.
They were able to partially limit the damage.
For example, only 16 of the 34 states have passed laws requiring photo identification.
However, the new rules introduced in 2012 will undoubtedly make the exercise of the right to vote more difficult.
Democratic critics denounce the partisan nature of the laws that have been passed, and see them as a clear goal to influence the results in the states that matter in 2012.
A 2011 report by the Brennan Center shows that the states that passed these laws account for 171 of the 270 electoral college votes needed to win the presidency.
It is too early to confirm with certainty that these legislative changes to the electoral system will have a significant impact on the outcome of the 2012 presidential elections.
But one thing is certain: these new rules will have a negative impact on voter turnout.
In this sense, these measures are partly undermining the US democratic system.
Prostate cancer screening: should the test be done or not?
In fact, the PSA test sometimes shows incorrect results, with false negative or even false positive results, leading to unnecessary medical intervention.
This leads to increased hesitation by already undecided men to carry out early detection tests.
Should the test be taken or not?
We sought the opinion of two specialists.
Studies conducted in the United States have found many disruptive factors between control groups, making it difficult to interpret these data and make clear recommendations.
Another study, this time from Europe, concluded that there is a difference in mortality between patients with and without early detection.
This study also showed that after 12 years of follow-up, the likelihood of metastasis is 30 to 40% higher if no early detection has been carried out.
That is why I recommend the test from the age of 50 or 40 if you have a direct relative who has already had prostate cancer.
Men of African-American descent are also at higher risk.
The most important thing is to make the right decision as soon as a cancer is detected.
There are cancers that are aggressive and others that are indolent.
The patient really needs to be made aware of the extent of the risk of his cancer by showing him the possible options where prostate cancer can go untreated if it does not affect his quality of life in the long term, and where it is more likely to be actively monitored.
Today, many men who have been diagnosed with cancer do not receive treatment because their cancer is not aggressive and does not pose a threat to their lives.
They are being offered active monitoring and treatment if the disease progresses.
The criteria for deciding who should and should not be treated are being determined with increasing accuracy.
That is why I still recommend that the test be carried out.
But the most important thing is to talk to your doctor to determine whether it should be done or not.
In collaboration with the International Society of Urology, Movember has developed a tool to evaluate the advantages and disadvantages of PSA testing.

Preventing the disease
Unfortunately, there is no miracle cure for cancer.
Despite advances in research, adopting a healthy lifestyle remains the best way to reduce the risk of developing it.
It is estimated that 30% of cancers could be prevented if everyone ate well and exercised sufficiently.
"If there were no more smokers, that figure would rise to at least 50%," said André Beaulieu, spokesman for the Canadian Cancer Society.
However, about 10% of cancers are thought to be caused by inheritance.
Several remain unaccounted for.
For the Canadian Cancer Society, the fight against tobacco addiction remains a priority, despite the decline in the number of smokers.
Smoking is responsible for 85% of lung cancer cases.
It is also a risk factor for several other cancers.
It is very damaging to people's health.
"There are still 1.5 million smokers in Quebec today," deplores spokesman André Beaulieu.
Encouraging data: 10 years after giving up cigarettes, the risk of dying from cancer is halved.

Overweight and obesity are also contributing to the outbreak, according to the Canadian Cancer Society.
They appear to increase the risk of breast, colon, rectum, oesophagus, pancreas and uterus cancer.
"Research shows that regular physical activity throughout life protects against colorectal cancer," he adds.

The organisation also recommends limiting the consumption of red meat.
Too much of it increases the risk of developing colorectal cancer.
Sausages should also be avoided.
Preservation of meat by smoking, drying or salting can lead to the formation of carcinogens.
"The latter can damage the body's cells and lead to the development of cancer," he explains.

In recent years, several scientists have investigated the link between vitamin supplements and cancer.
However, their research is not conclusive at this stage.
According to the Canadian Cancer Society, studies on vitamin E are contradictory.
While one study found a reduction in the risk of prostate cancer, another showed an increase.
The effect of vitamin D on cancer has also not yet been clearly demonstrated.
Mr Beaulieu also stresses the importance of talking to your doctor about your concerns and family history.
'Taking an early detection test doesn't lead to cancer. '
Analysing the Higgs boson
Last summer's announcement of the likely discovery of the Higgs boson caused quite a stir, and with good reason.
In fact, it is believed that this boson is involved in nothing less than the mechanism responsible for the mass of all objects in the universe.
Finally, it is the last particle whose existence has been predicted by the Standard Model - our best or "least false" explanation of nature and the behavior of matter - but which has not yet been empirically observed.
But for physicists, it is not yet completely certain that it really is the Higgs.
We know without a shadow of a doubt that we have a real new particle, and that it is very similar to the Higgs boson predicted by the Standard Model.
Moreover, this seems to be confirmed by new data presented this week at a major physics congress in Kyoto, but data is still lacking to be completely sure.
Nevertheless, let us assume that it is indeed the Higgs, because there seems to be little risk of deception, and let us see what it is.
There is an inevitable law in this world that means that two objects cannot be present in the same place at the same time.
It is not possible to break this rule - and do not try too hard as you will hurt yourself.
For even if particle physics is a really strange world, it turns out that such a law also applies to it: Pauli's principle of exclusion, which states that two particles cannot occupy the same space at the same time if they are in the same "quantum state," whereby this "state" consists broadly of some of their properties.
Based on this, the physicists divide the particles into two categories.
In one corner are the good citizens, known as fermions, who obey the Pauli principle.
And in the other move the bosons, an evil gang of anarchists to whom nothing is sacred - certainly not this principle, which means that they can indeed be in the same place at the same time.
These bosons, according to the website The Particle Adventure from the Berkeley laboratories (which, by the way, is absolutely amazing), are divided into two groups: the mesons, which we will not treat here, and the "force particles," through which the great forces of nature spread and with which the Higgs boson would be somehow related.
It must be emphasized here, however, that these bosons are not all such exotic creatures, as one might think.
If you are able to read this chronicle, it is only thanks to a boson of extraordinary banality: the photon or "particle of light," which is the "messenger" of electromagnetic force.
This is because when a particle with an electric charge accelerates or changes direction, the electromagnetic field is "disturbed" in this very place, much like a pebble thrown into a pond.
This "disturbance" produces an electromagnetic wave (light, infrared or ultraviolet radiation, etc.), and this wave is nothing more than a photon and thus one of the bosons "carriers of force."
Stable field
The same applies to the Higgs boson, with the difference that another field, the Higgs field, must be "disturbed" for this boson to appear.
However, the Higgs field is much more stable than the electromagnetic field; the agent must reach very high energies, somewhat comparable to a frozen pond, the surface of which could only be furrowed by a very large rock.
This is why a huge particle accelerator like CERN - the Large Hadron Collider is a ring with a circumference of 27 km! - is needed to achieve such energies.
The electromagnetic field analogy is again helpful to explain the relationship between the Higgs and mass.
In fact, not all particles and not all materials interact with the electromagnetic field.
Some, like magnets, do, but others don't - for example, a sheet of paper would never hold on to the fridge by itself.
Equally, not all particles interact with the Higgs field: those that do have mass, while the others (like the photon, by the way) have no mass.
So what can all this research be "good for," Ms Plamondon asks?
For science, they are used to verify the Standard Model (SM), and they also allow physicists to examine accurately any discrepancies between observations and predictions of SM.
There are, by the way, numerous physicists who fervently hope that such deviations will be found, since the slightest difference could open a door to a "new physics" and plug some holes in the model.
It must be said that the latter still has great deficiencies, as it offers no explanation for gravity (oops!) and dark matter, which makes up about 80% of the matter in the universe (oops again!).
However, no such discrepancies have been found at CERN so far.

The impact of this research on the general population is more difficult to predict, but it would be wrong to assume that there would be none.
By the way: in the early 1960s, the pioneers of the laser in the Bell laboratories did not suspect that their work would trigger such a revolution.
They saw scientific applications, but nothing else.
Indeed, the late physicist Willard Boyle - who worked at Bell Labs, where the laser was invented in the 1960s, and who himself developed the first continuous-wave laser (the first were pulsed) in 1962 - has already told us that the laser was initially seen more as a "laboratory gimmick."
Imagine...
Applications can also arise from all the instruments that surround research.
For example, Willard Boyle developed a small light sensor in 1969 while working in optics.
Although it was not its original purpose, this sensor now serves as an "eye" for all digital cameras worldwide and won him the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2009.
Of course, this does not mean that the activities of the LHC will necessarily change our lives, but it does mean that you really can never know...
Palliative care - the best way to die... | Le Devoir
Quebec recently discussed the thorny issue of end-of-life care with its Committee on Dying with Dignity.
The debate must resume shortly, although a draft law is being prepared.
However, much remains to be done in this important area.
Le Devoir has tried to take a closer look at this.
A few weeks ago, Mr. L. was still living alone in his apartment in Montérégie.
The prostate cancer that consumed him had given him two years to live.
"They gave me five years to live, I managed seven years," he said half-heartedly, lying in his bed in the Victor Gadbois palliative care home in Beloeil, where he had arrived the day before.
"It's always a shock, you can't be prepared for that," he says.
The disease does its work: an immeasurable weakness prevents him from going to the toilet alone and even from eating himself.
Sitting at the table before a delicious lunch, he resigned agrees to be helped with the meal.
Bravely, he even manages to smile and talk to the strangers who are busy around him, bringing him his medicine, and offering him a bath.
The courage of ordinary death.
"My biggest wish is for my diarrhea to be cured because it's humiliating," he says.
A few hours later, the team found a cure for the disease.
"Throughout our lives, we learn that a man pees standing up," says Pierre Brodeur, a psychologist at Victor-Gadbois Home.
Returning to childhood is an unacceptable humiliation for some people.
"It depends on the person's ability" to take a backward step, he notes.
Indeed, according to several people working in palliative care, major events are taking place in the midst of these regressions.
Patients admitted to Victor Gadbois' palliative care home are all suffering from cancer.
They have a maximum life expectancy of three months.
At this stage, they are no longer inundated with so-called "healing" care by the doctors and nurses who look after them.
For Mrs A, 89, the worst fear is of dying "deliberately and through asphyxiation."
But it was through the illness that I really got to know my children.
"I have good kids," she adds.
"I have no more desires in life," she says, before accepting that they put a mask on her to help her breathe.
She is still expecting one last visit from her son, who is from Italy, in the next few days.
At Victor-Gadbois Home, a group of volunteers offer personal hygiene and help with food intake.
Palliative care is used when there are no other options.
To make dying more pleasant.
In Quebec, there is one bed for palliative care for every 11,700 inhabitants.
That is very little when you consider that one day we will all die.
Here life continues under the best possible conditions, explains Dr. Christiane Martel, one of the home's doctors.
Both at the level of physical, emotional or spiritual comfort.
The dying person is given oral hygiene with brandy or Pepsi as desired.
Diabetics no longer need to control their blood sugar levels.
And death is part of everyday life.
Last night we served a beer to Mr X, who died during the night.
This morning his son will drink the beer at the feet of the deceased.
"We help relatives and patients alike," said Nathalie Savard, the nursing director.
In Victor Gadbo's home, no day is like the other.
Next to an old man of 93, enjoying the last family gathering in the courtyard and being well supported by his pillows while toasting in his honour, a young man of 36, surrounded by his parents, his wife and his two young children, dies tragically, having tried everything to survive.
"For the past six months, three to five beds have always been occupied by cancer patients under the age of 45," says Dr Christiane Martel with concern.
53% of the patients admitted to Victor-Gadbois Home come from their homes, 47% from the hospital.
Problem of access to palliative care
It is said that 77% of Canadians do not have access to palliative care, that is, care designed to alleviate the suffering of patients when they have reached the end stage of their lives, either at home, in hospital or in a nursing home.
And several organizations, such as Victor-Gadbois Home and the Montreal-area Home Palliative Care Society, specialize more or less exclusively in the care of cancer patients.
It is precisely this profound inadequacy in Quebec's health care system that makes several doctors specializing in palliative care wary of passing a law regulating euthanasia and assisted suicide.
Since October, a manifesto has been circulating, signed by prominent figures in palliative care, such as Dr Balfour Mount and Dr Bernard Lapointe, to express their opposition to such an initiative.
According to Dr Christiane Martel, Quebec's health system is not performing well enough to ensure that everyone has the right to quality palliative care before accepting euthanasia.
Recently, she says, I saw a patient who had been in the emergency room for 14 days with severe pain, with no measures taken to alleviate it.
I am afraid that patients only want to die because they do not receive adequate healthcare.
And at the same time, despite the worst prognosis, several oncologists doggedly treat their patients until the last day.
Hélène Richard's chances of survival were already minimal when she stopped an arduous course of chemotherapy.
When I told my oncologist that I was going to stop treatment, she told me that she regretted giving up the fight, she said.
However, she had told me that I was at the end of my tether!
No omnipotent care
Dr. Martel believes that 90% of patients who have asked to die thank the nursing staff for not complying after their pain was relieved by a palliative care team.
It must be made clear, however, that palliative care is not omnipotent in the treatment of pain.
According to Elsie Monereau, director of palliative care for the Montreal Metropolitan Home Palliative Care Society, 8% of patients do not respond to pain treatment.
At the very end of life, doctors often resort to terminal sedation, which involves euthanizing the patient either sporadically or permanently until he or she dies.
We can no longer pretend that we do not perceive this side of suffering.
Patients without pain relief will increasingly have the opportunity to resort to this terminal sedation.
Patients whose pain is not relieved all say the same sentence: "I want to die."
But that doesn't necessarily mean "I want you to put me to sleep," but "I want my pain to be relieved."
The realization of this report was possible due to a journalism fellowship of Canadian health research institutes.
Large-scale real estate scandals in Quebec
Every day, civil servants from the road works department, major construction companies, fundraisers of political parties and specialists in the Italian mafia tell us what they know about a great "system" involving the construction industry, civil servants, politicians, trade unionists and mafioso.
An "industry" that was very expensive for Quebec taxpayers, especially in the 1990s and 2000s.
"It's strange how the system has crumbled since drastic measures were taken," quips Jacques Duchesneau, a Quebec legislator and former head of Montreal's police force.
The scandal was exposed by him following a thorough investigation into embezzlement involving road works contracts in Quebec, to which the then prime minister reluctantly agreed.
The "Duchesneau Report" established a direct link between industry, secret financing of political parties and bribery of officials.
"Since the investigation began in 2010," he points out, "the Department of Transportation alone would have saved $1 billion on contracts," because some reined in their instincts to get their share!
The Charbonneau Commission "has already brought down two mayors," he adds, in the hope that it will succeed in "exposing the tactics behind the individuals."
A permanent anti-corruption unit established in 2011
Established in 2011, the permanent anti-corruption unit is also making great efforts with its troop of government auditors, investigators, and analysts.
Then there are the policemen of the "Marteau force," which, since 2009, has made the Montreal "sewer cartel" more cautious in artificially inflating contracts...
In recent weeks, it has conducted a series of house searches and brought fraud and corruption charges against municipal officials such as Frank Tampino and Richard Marcotte, who is the mayor of a suburb.
Next on the list would be Gilles Vaillancourt, who has just stepped down as mayor of Laval, Quebec's third-largest city.
He is suspected of repeatedly taking bribes in exchange for public contracts.
Specifically accused were engineers from the Montreal Road Construction Authority, as well as entrepreneurs of Italian origin, such as Tony Accurso and Lino Zambito.
The latter caused a stir by explaining to the Commission the operation of the "public procurement system."
For several years, he himself paid 3% of the value of the contracts obtained in Montreal to an intermediary linked to the mafia, who transferred the money to the Union Montreal, the party of Mayor Gérald Tremblay.
Mr Zambito played his hand everywhere in the 2000s, giving more than 88,000 Canadian dollars (about 68,000 euros) to provincial parties, especially the Liberals who were in power at the time.
He also admitted organising an illegal fundraiser for former Liberal vice-president Nathalie Normandeau.
Sewer contracts, the cost of which he has artificially inflated
In Montreal, the "system" of corruption worked smoothly.
Gilles Surprenant, a former civil engineer, described this in detail to the Commission: in ten years, he received gifts from the construction company, invitations to travel, golf tournaments, restaurants, and ice hockey games, as well as bribes amounting to $736,000 in exchange for sewer contracts, the cost of which he artificially inflated.
Other Roads Agency officials have admitted that they allowed themselves to be smeared by artificially inflating bills by 30-40% with bogus add-ons.
An organiser for the mayor's party, Martin Dumont, also accused Mr Tremblay of deliberately overlooking a shadow budget that was filling his coffers with black money.
Following the revelations, Mr Tremblay resigned in early November, plunging Montreal into a severe crisis.
Chantal Rouleau was one of the first Montreal deputies to raise the alarm.
As mayor of the municipality of Rivière-des-Prairies, in the east of the island, she rebelled in 2010 against the sale of a municipal plot of land purchased for $5 million and resold for $1.6 million to developers in the booming real estate market.
70% black money in election campaigns
Of the investigation that will eventually be carried out, she says that it will "pull a thread that will allow us to understand the workings of the system infiltrated by ants in order to stop the evil and denounce the culprits."
She says the procedure is "painful but positive."
We are cleaning up the wound, but we would need a Montreal-only investigative unit and oversight to prevent the return of questionable practices.
How to clean.
Regular.
Jacques Duchesneau, for his part, notes that "officials stole hundreds of millions of dollars," but he is particularly concerned about the role of "elected officials who know the tactics" if they were not involved in the fraud!
Referring to a 70% share of black money in the funding of Quebec's election campaigns, he quips: "I have been told that this is only a faint reflection of reality."
The Quebec government is proposing to limit donations to parties to $100, which he says would not change the situation: "Unless campaign spending is strictly limited, black money will circulate in politics."
He recommends a complete overhaul of the public procurement and party funding system: "We cannot fall deeper; by getting to the bottom of things with courage, we can rebuild the House on a sounder footing, with more controls and laws."
If this story damages the international reputation of Quebec and Montreal, Mr. Duchesneau invites those who laugh at it to take a look in their own backyard...
"PSG is not FC Barcelona!"
This season they have taken on a whole new dimension with PSG.
How do you explain this progress?
It can be explained by a personal insight, but also by the new dimension of PSG.
Great players have come.
Every day I am making progress by her side.
The technical staff have also given me a lot.
These elements spur me on every day to improve my level of play.
And in a game, it's even easier.
Everything happens very quickly in football.
But I'm not bursting with enthusiasm.
From my beginnings at the centre of preparatory training at INF Clairefontaine until my playing days at Saint-Etienne, I have always made incremental progress.
They are taking advantage of the competition introduced by Carlo Ancelotti...
This summer's signings are used to playing at a very high level.
They also know that every training session is crucial.
The result is that a player like me has to stand up and do his best.
By the way, Carlo Ancelotti gives me a lot in terms of my playing position.
He is supported by assistant coaches such as Claude Makelele, who played in the same position as me.
Is Ancelotti the right person for the job?
Of course.
Ancelotti instils respect in all technicians.
There is no comparable figure in Ligue 1 at the moment and he is one of the best coaches in Europe.
He has a wealth of experience and has won many titles with prestigious clubs.
He had contact with great players.
I think he will win more titles in Paris.
I had an encouraging conversation with him in January.
At the time, I had just recovered from a series of injuries.
The trust he has placed in me is also an explanation of my achievements.
What do you think of PSG's first part of the season?
In Ligue 1, Lyon have taken our place at the top of the table.
But we are lurking in ambush.
One of our most important goals is the Champions League: we qualified for the last 16 in this way.
What is the goal of the club in this competition?
We will try to get as far as possible.
From now on, anything is possible.
However, we will have our say against very good European teams.
First of all we want to finish first in our group ahead of Porto, so that we can play the second leg of the round of 16 as a home game.
Can PSG become a big European club in the short term?
He already has the budget for it...
To become a big European club, Paris needs to win titles and make a name for itself in the long term.
That is not the case today.
Financially, PSG is giving itself the means to put this project into practice.
Would it be a huge failure not to win the Ligue 1 title, as they did last season?
Of course, that would be a huge disappointment.
This year it is really close to our hearts to win this title.
Last season we were close.
In May we were disappointed because we were strong enough to win.
We finished the season with a very strong performance.
We finished with 79 points.
Normally you should be the champion with 79 points...
But another team, Montpellier, have had an even better season.
I think this year is the right one.
Even if the big teams like Marseille, Lyon or Bordeaux are fighting for the title, I think we have what it takes to win it.
Do you think the media expect too much from PSG?
Given what has been invested and the players we have, it is normal that a lot is expected of us.
We fully accept that.
But if we win 4-0 at home against Troyes and you still find something to blame, it's definitely a bit frustrating.
One wonders what else people are expecting.
We could never win 4-0 every weekend.
We are not FC Barcelona!
We're trying to come up with a game plan.
A team builds itself up over time.
We showed strength in the Champions League.
Look at Manchester City, a club who have failed to qualify for the last two seasons and who have also spent vast sums.
In terms of the sums invested, you were 15 points ahead at the break!
That would mean ignoring our opponents and the French championship.
Lyon and Marseille, who were not good last season, have been "boosted" by this new PSG.
This shows that Ligue 1 is exciting.
I hope that in the month of May we will be the smiling winner and tell ourselves that, despite all the difficulties, we have finally won it.
PSG seem to depend entirely on the performances of Zlatan Ibrahimovic.
All the better to talk about a "Zlatan addiction."
That means Ibrahimovic is powerful and scores plenty of goals.
That's why he has come and proved he is the star of Ligue 1.
Wherever he has played, he has shown that he is a great player and a world star.
Within the team we respect both the player and the person.
He also respects the people around him.
What he has achieved is truly extraordinary.
This encourages others to improve their level of play.
Thiago Silva, who is one of the best defenders in the world, is also allowing everyone else to progress.
How did you experience Euro 2012 with the French national team?
How disappointing.
It was close to my heart to participate in this European Championship.
Unfortunately my injury prevented me from getting some game time.
I saw things there that made me stronger.
Today I manage to play well in the national team.
This has been my hope since my baptism with the Bleus.
We have learned our lesson from what happened in Ukraine, and today we must set an example.
What do you think of Didier Deschamps' first few months at the helm of Les Bleus?
He has achieved promising results.
We are in a good position in the World Cup qualifying group.
The national coach is strict, is close to the players and inspires them to win.
As was Laurent Blanc.
But I don't want to make a comparison.
Blanc had achieved his goal by qualifying us for the European Championship.
I hope Didier Deschamps takes the Bleus to Brazil.
Does the 1-1 draw in Spain on October 16 constitute an opening match?
This game has given us confidence.
Everyone stood up for everyone else.
Before that meeting in Spain, I had never seen a match like it in my career.
Bitcoin allows you to pay and sell without a bank
The opposite of the current monetary exchange based on central banks, identified transactions and handling fees between the parties.
Moreover, as is so often the case in these technologies, a political vision is tangible: the conviction that the current monetary system, shaped by banking monopolies, is leading to financial crises.
In fact, Bitcoin, invented by Satoshi Nakamoto (a pseudonym), is both a virtual currency (but convertible into dollars, euros, etc.) and a secure exchange protocol, such as BitTorrent, which allows files to be exchanged directly.
Approximately 200,000 transactions have already been recorded with 15,000 computers in the network.
Several thousand websites accept Bitcoin as a donation or as a means of payment.
After peaking at $30 (23 euros) in June 2011, the price of bitcoin fell to $2 five months later, before recovering to around $10 today (prices are listed on the bitcoincharts.com website).
Nothing particularly impressive in comparison to the world trade of real currencies or financial products.
Nevertheless, the European Central Bank (ECB) showed interest in this in a report on virtual currencies published in October.
It describes Bitcoin as "the virtual currency with the greatest success," "competing with the dollar or euro" and "similar to traditional currencies."
Bitcoin differs from other types of virtual currencies, such as "credits," which are used to advance in a video game, which can be won or bought (and sometimes exchanged) by playing games.
The social network Facebook has also developed such a system.
However, the trade is controlled and processed each time by a central authority.
With Bitcoin, all network nodes are simultaneously depositaries of the accounting book, auditors, money issuers, and buyers and sellers.
How does this network work?
Every transaction between two users actually takes place between two e-mail addresses in the form of an e-mail.
The only difference is that the user can choose a different address for each payment, which ensures anonymity.
A number of data related to this transaction is electronically signed by a double encryption system.
This allows the network to verify the authenticity of the transaction.
Using the contents of the file, it is also possible to ensure that the traded bitcoins are present in the accounting book of public accounts, which is widespread throughout the network.
The decisive step is to register this new transaction in this book.
This is done via a mathematical task that is started on the computers, with the winner, who is a kind of temporary central banker, having the privilege of adding that extra line.
It is a fragmentation of the file, i.e. the conversion of a large file into a shorter and unique electronic fingerprint.
The computers "take" the new transaction and add a number to it before the whole thing is "hacked."
The goal is to find the number that gives a special fingerprint (many zeros at the beginning).
If this number is found, the other nodes can easily check if it is the correct one.
The transaction is thus permanently linked to the chain of all other transactions, and any modification would change the fingerprint.
If a user wants to cheat twice very quickly (less than 10 minutes) with the same money, only one of the two transactions would be validated by the network and the other would remain unlinked, as both have different fingerprints.
The computer that solved the problem will receive 50 Bitcoins.
To prevent inflation, this reward is regularly halved, probably before the end of 2012.
The number of Bitcoins in circulation is thus limited to 21 million, but divisible to one hundred millionth, which leaves some room for manoeuvre...
In addition, the difficulty of the task increases with each improvement in computing power.
The life of the network has already had its ups and downs.
The websites that provide services for Bitcoin have been attacked and the Bitcoin deposits stolen.
"The vulnerability used does not affect the actual protocol," says Pierre Noizat, who has just launched Paymium, a real money payment company that uses the Bitcoin network.
The ECB also reports on the possibilities of money laundering using this anonymous service.
However, cash also has these shortcomings.
Major players such as Wikipedia refuse to accept donations of this kind.
Others like the blog platform WordPress accept them.
Recently, Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron of the Weizmann Institute in Israel analyzed the book of accounts and showed that almost 80% of bitcoins are not in circulation.
A "mega sale" was launched in November.
"Thirty thousand dollars were exchanged," says Jon Holmquist, who works for Coinabul, a company that converts bitcoins into gold.
Pierre Noizat, who is also the author of a book on this currency, strongly believes in the potential of this technology as a transaction network.
Its Paytunia system is similar to a credit card (with real money) or contactless payment with a mobile phone, but uses Bitcoin to validate transactions, making them cheaper.
In addition, the owner manages his identity and can thus remain anonymous.
The system can be easily implemented by merchants, who do not need to install new terminals or computer programs.
All you have to do is provide an address that can be "photographed and recognised" by a phone, says Pierre Noizat, who claims he has thousands of users.
There is a general trend towards rethinking hierarchical systems in favour of more horizontal systems.
"It will take time for bitcoin to catch on, but 2013 could be a turning point," he predicts.
Moreover, in its report, the ECB envisages reassessing the various risks that are now considered high if this currency succeeds.
We left Afghanistan.
And after that?
French troops have left their area of responsibility in Afghanistan (Kapisa and Surobi).
NATO and the US are expected to follow at the end of 2014.
It is time for the Afghan army to take back control of its territory and for the Afghan people to decide their future without expecting everything from us.
In particular, we have punished Afghan farmers by treating them as terrorists.
And ourselves with our 88 soldiers killed, as well as the injured and disabled.
The Taliban are made up of foreign extremists, former leaders who have fled to Pakistan, but often also peasants who refuse to allow a foreign armed presence, as was the case during the Soviet era.
They want to defend their centuries-old and archaic traditions, even if they are joined by jihadists, Pakistanis, Arabs, Uzbeks and Tajiks.
Tolerated, sometimes supported by local insurgents, the latter will no longer be there when Western countries become more discreet.
The withdrawal of French troops from the Nijrab base, which I observed from a hill planted with almond trees, financed with French credits, was carried out properly.
Truck and tank convoys overflown by helicopters have reached Kabul without being attacked.
From the end of 2014, there will be no more influx of the Taliban into Kabul.
Conditions have changed since their irresistible advance from 1994 to 1996.
At the time, Kabul was empty and war raged across the country because of the fighting between the various insurgent groups.
Their seizure of power was seen at the time as a kind of liberation and return to security.
Afghan women have paid the price for the obscurantism of the peasants overwhelmed by Al-Qaeda, but their situation has not improved to this day.
Former mujahideen, the Afghan government and the current Taliban share a common desire to keep women in a subordinate position.
The most important figures of the anti-Soviet war returned to power in 2001.
They have turned themselves into profiteers by seizing government land to sell as construction land to refugees from Iran and Pakistan, taking advantage of massive American subcontracting.
They have brought themselves into disrepute, and most of them were not involved in the fighting themselves.
As I have heard in the campaigns, people want a government that is not made up of thieves.
Many young people want to leave the country, like those who have benefited from American handouts: capital flight is considerable.
Young people are fed up with war and its ideologies.
During their exile in Iran or Pakistan, they have had contact with the modern world and enjoyed its benefits.
About 65% of the population is under 25 years of age; Kabul now has 5 million inhabitants, which is one fifth of the total population.
In the cities, state schools are full of girls as well as boys.
These young people, who do not want to return to the obscurantism of the old parties or the corruption of certain leaders, will have to be provided with jobs.
Everyone, including the armed parties, is obsessed with mobile phones; television, with its Turkish series depicting the modern world, is watched everywhere.
An army is now in place.
Will the authorities under whose authority it will be under be regarded as legitimate?
Former commanders of the anti-Soviet struggle are already working to restore the provincial militias that will elude the power of the central government.
Afghanistan, the country of mountains with strong local identities, should have benefited from a degree of decentralization based on the example of Western nations, but by abolishing the office of prime minister, which had existed since the 1964 constitution, the US wanted to make it a centralized state with strong presidential power.
President Karzai does not want foreign controls, especially in the run-up to elections scheduled for April 2014.
However, his country has been dependent on foreign aid since the 1950s and long before that.
Industries have not been rebuilt, functioning dams are non-existent, and important irrigation systems have not been repaired.
Everything is imported; apart from fruit and vegetables, nothing is produced.
Priority is given to private initiative.
In a country devastated by 30 years of war, state control of infrastructure would have been necessary.
The rumour has been spread that Afghanistan possesses immense mineral resources.
This reinforces the impression that the Western countries were only there to seize it.
Without energy to process the iron or copper ore on site, or without means of transport for export via the mountains, mining is not possible.
The Chinese have almost left the copper mine of Mes Aynak, let the international archaeologists (financed by the World Bank) excavate the huge Buddhist site and remain the main employers of the province.
One day it will also be necessary for Afghanistan and Pakistan, on which imports and exports largely depend, to restore normal relations.
The withdrawal of French combat troops was completed on 20 November.
The new cooperation agreement provides for the continuation of traditional aid: girls "and boys" grammar schools, the French Institute at universities, the French Institute, cooperation in the military, legal, medical and agricultural fields, support for the archaeological delegation.
Since 2009, a Civil-Military Action Service of the Ministry of Defense (Cimic), which was discontinued in 2012, has carried out in dozens of mountain villages numerous public works and measures for the rehabilitation of agriculture, and commissioned a small French non-governmental organization to try to "win hearts and minds" and achieve the impossible task of reconciling aid and offensive actions.
This work, which required a large number of local workers, has helped to quell the insurgency: irrigation, wells, drinking water, reforestation, fruit trees, soil protection, and increased agricultural land.
What souvenir will we leave behind after spending EUR 2 billion on military equipment?
A much more modest budget will contribute to the improvement of local living conditions, which are very hard in these valleys, often situated at an altitude of more than 2000 metres.
The embassy has received dozens of written requests from small agricultural projects from municipalities in Kapisa province.
In order for farmers to free themselves from the insurgency led by foreign groups, which they say they want, small, well-controlled and directly related civilian aid would be needed in their favour.
A Constitution with a Crowbar in Egypt
It is a new poker game by President Mohammed Morsi.
While Egypt remains more divided than ever over the Constitutional Declaration, which temporarily grants it unlimited power, it has decided to put everything on the same map.
To everyone's surprise, he announced on Wednesday that the Constituent Assembly would adopt its final version the next day.
Just a week ago, the Head of State granted this plenary two additional months to complete its work.
Egypt has been relying for almost two years on a provisional text that has been amended several times, weakening institutional stability and leading to legal confusion.
This new initiative has only served to further divide the country.
To his opponents, the president persists in his "autocratic delirium," continuing to "break his word" and "trample the law underfoot."
Its supporters assure that it is a way to end the institutional and political crisis as quickly as possible and to accelerate the transition process.
A referendum should be held within 14 days.
A very short period of time that forces the Brothers to renounce their plan to explain the text to the Egyptians section by section.
It is also a way for the president to regain his public and democratic legitimacy as protests rage across the country.
After confirming in an interview with the American newsreel Time, Mohammed Morsi seems convinced that Egyptians will vote in favor.
Especially as this precipitous vote gives the Egyptian people an ultimatum: "Either you vote for my draft or I will retain unlimited authority," the latter should supposedly come to an end once the constitution has been adopted.
Eighty-five members of the Constituent Assembly, most of them Islamists, adopted the text yesterday in a strange atmosphere.
The majority of Liberals did not comply with the request.
Shortly before the Constitutional Declaration in mid-November, they turned their backs, believing that they had not been able to assert their views.
Representatives of human rights organisations, religious minorities or civil society have acted in the same way.
Yesterday morning, 11 people, alternate members, were hastily added to the quorum.
Some are very close to the Muslim Brotherhood.
It is not surprising that most of the articles were adopted unanimously.
Incidentally, commentators found it amusing that the only difference of opinion of the day... was expressed in the time of prayer, as some members of the body felt that the pendulum clock of the Constituent Assembly was not accurate.
The text, which was adopted last night, consists of 234 articles.
Article 2, which caught everyone's attention, remains identical to that of the 1971 Constitution, stating that "the principles of Sharia law are the main source of law."
The Salafist parties, for whom the establishment of Islamic law is an important demand, had hoped to replace "the principles" with "the rules," which would have made stricter application possible.
For the Islamists, the fact that this article has not been amended is proof of their goodwill and respect for other members of Egyptian society.
"Hypocrisy," retorts the liberals, who see this as nothing more than a propaganda stunt.
According to them, the Islamization of the Constitution takes place through other articles.
In particular, they have in mind Article 220, which grants the University of Al-Azhar an advisory role, in particular with regard to verifying conformity with Sharia law.
According to Egypt specialist Sophie Pommier, this is worrying because "the people who are invited to give their opinion have not been elected and have no democratic legitimacy whatsoever.
One can see in this the first signs of a theocracy. "
Liberals "fears are also fed by the fact that the university's next rector is likely to be far less moderate than the current one.
"At the moment there is no concrete religious commitment.
With this constitution we remain within the framework of the bourgeois state.
Most of the lawyers who have worked on this text are not Ulema, but academics, some of whom have been trained in the French system, "says Alexis Blouet, who is writing a doctoral thesis on the Egyptian constitutional transition.
However, he acknowledges "that there may be ambiguity with regard to Article 220, since the terms used are borrowed from the religious vocabulary.
One refers here in particular to the "Fiqh" [Islamic jurisprudence, ed.].
And in the future, the question could be raised as to the extent to which civil judges are competent to decide on this. "
In addition to its religious aspect, the text adopted yesterday has been heavily criticised for the far-reaching powers it grants to the President of the Republic.
The Muslim Brotherhood argues that these are significantly reduced compared to the former regime.
Another point of contention: the powers of the army.
In accordance with the wishes of the military, the audit of the defence budget will not be submitted to Parliament, but to a National Defence Council.
Similarly, there will be no ban on civil trials in military courts, as the human rights defence associations have called for.
The latter also share their fears about the text, which they regard as a threat to freedom.
The offence of blasphemy is maintained and insults are now banned, which could have serious consequences for freedom of expression, especially for the press.
Moreover, as Heba Morayef of Human Rights Watch points out, no article refers to the protection of women.
In their opinion, the only positive point is the prohibition of torture by Article 36.
This word was not included in the previous Constitution.
While the Egyptian president was forced to speak on television last night, demonstrations are planned for this afternoon.
Supporters of the head of state will march Saturday.
In Israel, Ukrainian tourists await sacred sites, the navel of the world and a sea of brine
The Promised Land combines the glory of biblical truths, modern comforts and unspoiled nature.
AIF gives you the five most important reasons to visit Israel.
Bowing to the Sacred Places
Visit the River Jordan, where Jesus was baptized.
It is said that all who bathe in this river receive God's blessings.
Galilee is the place where Jesus performed his miracles: changing water into wine at a wedding ceremony, walking on water, calming the storm and catching fish.
It was here that Jesus appeared to his disciples after the resurrection.
Most of the sanctuaries, however, are in Jerusalem.
Believers walk here the Way of Passion or Way of the Cross of Jesus Christ (in Latin: Via Dolorosa).
The route starts at the Roman fortress Antonia, Pretorium, where the Judgment was, and leads through the streets of the old town to the Church of the Holy Sepulchre on Mount Golgotha, where the place of the crucifixion, the anointing stone and the tomb of Jesus are located.
Here, according to the Christian view, is the navel of the world, which symbolizes the salvation of mankind.
The Monastery of the Holy Cross in Jerusalem stands on the site where, according to a Christian legend, the tree from which the cross for Jesus "crucifixion was made grew.
Jerusalem is also home to the holiest Jewish site - the Western Wall, the remains of a temple destroyed by the Romans in 70 AD.
Traditionally, people of different faiths leave notes there with wishes, which are then fulfilled.
Take a trip up the mountain
The ruins of the Massada fortress are the remains of the secret hiding place from enemies that Herod the Great had built for his family in 25 AD.
They are located on a rock face in the mountains at an altitude of 450 metres above sea level.
Only climbers can reach the ruins on their own.
Everyone else takes a cable car to this historic peak.
In the north of the country, at an altitude of 1600 to 2040 metres, is the famous ski resort of Hermon, which attracts countless tourists in the winter months.
There is a shuttle bus from the foot of the mountain.
The ski slopes have a total length of 45 kilometers.
According to an ancient legend, pagan gods lived on the mountain top.
Visit unique museums
There are almost 300 museums in this country.
Not all of them can be visited on a single trip.
But at least the five most interesting should be visited.
Among them is the Israel Museum not far from the Knesset (parliament).
Ancient Qumran manuscripts or Dead Sea Scrolls found in caves in the Judean Desert are kept there, as well as approximately 500,000 archaeological and anthropological exhibits.
The Museum of Art in Tel Aviv is also worth a visit.
It exhibits the collection of works by the Impressionists and Expressionists Monet, Pissaro, Renoir, Cézanne, Sisley, Matisse, Modigliani, Chagall and Picasso.
In Akko, you can visit the museum in the Al Basha Bath, which houses several halls of old Turkish baths with sculptures of the former visitors and bathing attendants.
In Caesarea you should visit the unique private Ralli Museum, where you can admire sculptures by Dali and Rodin.
There are no museum guides or souvenir shops.
Admission is free, and donations are generally refused.
The fifth museum, the Holocaust Museum or Yad Vashem in Tel Aviv, tells of one of the most harrowing chapters in history.
The most moving section is the Memorial to Children, built in memory of the 1.5 million children who were exterminated in the concentration camps and gas chambers.
Upon entering the room, there is complete darkness.
Stars twinkle.
And the names of the Jewish children and the countries in which they died resound.
Ukraine is also mentioned there.
Do something for your health
Israel's three most important recreational areas are on the shores of the Mediterranean, the Red Sea and the Dead Sea.
At each of the three locations there are swimming pools, water parks, dolphinariums and oceanariums.
Amazingly, bathers also swim in the Red Sea during the winter months, as the water temperature does not drop below 21 ° C and the air warms up to 23 ° C.
The Dead Sea is even warmer and bathes all year round.
Incidentally, this unusual sea, at 417 metres below sea level, is the deepest sea in the world.
Its turquoise blue water has a high salinity and therefore even non-swimmers can easily wear it on the surface.
The surrounding landscape is indescribably beautiful.
Visitors come here for treatments using salt water (natural brine) and medicinal mud, as well as for the treatment of skin infections, allergies, asthma, eczema, arthritis, bronchitis, diabetes and for the soothing of strained nerves.
Touching the mysteries of antiquity
These secrets are hidden in the old city of Tel Aviv, the city of Jaffa on the Mediterranean coast.
The famous sea route connecting Egypt, Syria, Anatolia and Mesopotamia passed through this city.
The city is mentioned in ancient Greek and ancient Egyptian legends.
According to tradition, it was here that Noah built his ark, and it was here that Perseus saved the beautiful Andromeda, with whom he lived a long and happy life.
Tourists like to stroll through the narrow streets named after the signs of the zodiac.
According to legend, Fortuna is supposed to be of help to anyone who touches the walls in the alley with their zodiac sign.
In Jaffa you can meet newlyweds from all over Israel and even from other countries during photo shoots.
In Caesarea, the city of King Herod, you can wander through the Roman theatre and conquer the fortress of the Crusaders.
In Roman times Caesarea was the most important city in Judea and the residence of the Roman governors, including Pontius Pilate.
The carefully restored theatre nowadays hosts evening concerts and operas.

When you go to Israel, don't worry about your poor English skills: about 30% of Israelis speak Russian.
The money for the trip is not to be taken in euros, but in dollars, which can easily be changed into shekels (current exchange rate: 1 dollar at 3.8 shekels).
You can usually get around the city by bus, but Jerusalem also has a high-speed tram, and Haifa has the only six-station metro line in the country that connects the Lower City with the Upper City.
Strictly speaking, it is an underground funicular.
A journey within the city costs 6 shekels, regardless of the mode of transport, which is enough, including transfer, for a journey of up to 1.5 hours.
According to Jewish tradition, the Sabbath is celebrated on Saturdays in Israel.
Markets and shops are closed from Friday evening until sunset on Saturday, and public transport is suspended.
And on Sunday morning, the working week begins.
Many cafes, restaurants and pubs serve only kosher food, which excludes pork, seafood, fish without scales and food containing both dairy and meat products.
Instead, you can choose from a variety of dishes with mutton and beef, soups and desserts (made with coconut milk), traditional Jewish humus paste, various sauces, fried balls of pureed beans and peas (falafel), and fruits and vegetables.
There are no stray dogs on the streets of Israeli cities.
But there are many well-fed cats, who roam comfortably and unmolested through the streets.
In the evening they are even seen sleeping on the roofs of parked cars.
The cats like busy places and don't say no to treats.
Depending on the brand, a rental car costs between 37 dollars a day (Hyundai Getz) and 188 dollars (Audi A6, Volvo S80).
Insurance costs an additional $15 a day.
And bicycle rental costs 15 shekels per day.
Tickets to museums cost on average 30 shekels.

In 2012, more than three million tourists from all over the world visited Israel.
Most of the adventurers and relaxers came from Russia, France, Germany, Italy, England, the USA and Ukraine.
From January to October 2012, 118.8 thousand Ukrainian tourists came to the Promised Land, an increase of 51% compared to the same period in 2010, before the lifting of visa requirements on 9 February 2011.
"The Great and Powerful" Leads to Moscow: Migrants Save Money on Language
While MPs and civil rights campaigners debate the benefits of the law on mandatory language tests for migrants, criminals are already trading fake certificates
Every year, 13 million migrant workers come to Moscow, St. Petersburg and other Russian cities.
Most of them are citizens of Central Asia: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan.
Their only goal is to earn money to support the families who remain at home.
On 1 December, a law came into force requiring every migrant worker to take a test certifying knowledge of the Russian language.
Until now, the scheme has only applied to migrants wishing to work in the service sector, municipal housing and retail.
However, over time, the tests will become mandatory for all migrant workers, according to the Federal Migration Agency.
It is necessary to take not only language tests, but also tests on Russian history and the basics of legislation.
Language skills must be demonstrated both for obtaining and extending a work permit.
Exceptions apply only to citizens of countries where Russian is an official language.
Also excluded from this law are persons who received their education certificates and diplomas before the break-up of the USSR in 1991.
Sense, problems and protection of rights
All the examination bodies will be under the aegis of the Pushkin Institute of the Russian Language, the Russian University of Friendship with Peoples, the Moscow State University, the St. Petersburg State University and other Russian universities.
Migrants will be able to take the tests in all cities; more than 160 centres have already been opened in Russia.
The initiative to introduce the tests was supported by deputies of the State Duma and the Federal Migration Agency.
Civil rights activists, on the other hand, asked the following question several times in the press before the law came into force: What is the point of all this?
What changes will the requirement to have language skills bring to both Russians and migrant workers?
Above all, say spokesmen for the Migration Board, the aim is to reduce the number of forced laborers.
"Many people are now talking about protecting the rights of migrant workers," says Viktor Sebelev, head of the Federal Migration Service Representation in Tajikistan.
However, their rights must be protected before they leave.
Only organized recruitment will solve 90% of the problems of foreign workers.
Problems are encountered by migrants without a profession, education, language skills and medical expertise.
Sebelev is convinced that a future migrant without language skills will inevitably encounter people with bad intentions who, under the pretext of help, will place him in a dark, cramped shack, where he will endure months without food and documents with dozens of his peers, toiling 12 to 14 hours a day.
We receive many complaints from our migrants.
"You are promised one thing in your home country, and on arrival you are deceived, have your passports confiscated and do not receive the promised wages," confirms Tolib Schwaripov, head of the Central Labour Migration Administration of the Tajik Migration Board.
Don't swear, boss!
Nevertheless, many citizens of the Central Asian republics who want to make their money in Russia admit that not only do they not know the language of the destination country, but that they can hardly express themselves in writing in their own language.
Of course, this is not so much their fault as the evil: few Turkmen, Uzbeks, and Tajiks can afford even a decent primary education.
Their families do not even have money to feed their children, let alone buy them decent clothes, shoes and school supplies.
As teenagers, these children immediately seize the first opportunity to make money.
"It's difficult without language skills," they admit.
"You feel humiliated and inferior."
Civil rights advocates stress the following important aspect of the law.
Only migrants with legal status have to pass the test.
If you do not have this status, there is no audit and therefore no official work.
Meanwhile, the majority of migrant workers remain in Russia illegally.
"Welcome" or "Access forbidden to unauthorized persons"
Many migrants acknowledge that it is not easy to obtain official status in Russia.
This is due to bureaucratic hurdles and, of course, linguistic difficulties.
In addition, legalization costs money: 12 to 16 thousand rubles.
Fake registration can be done quickly and only for one and a half thousand.
The employees of the Russian police know that most of our documents are forged and we are not registered, and cases of extortion arise as a result.
"They want one or two hundred rubles for cigarettes and tea," Tajik Umed Hushkadamov told reporters.
'Don't be afraid of the cost of false papers'
Already on the day the law came into force, it turned out that not only the registration documents of migrants could be forged.
Some fake certificates certifying the completion of the language test have already been confiscated by employees of the Federal Migration Agency.
The counterfeit papers were printed with an ordinary colour printer.
Of course, the new owners did not receive them in vain: every migrant hoping to avoid the tests paid seven thousand rubles for the document.
That is more than double the cost of the official test, which costs one migrant worker three thousand rubles.
Both officials and civil rights activists agree that the most important immediate task is to protect the system from corruption, so that the certificates cannot simply be bought.
For now, the authorities can only promise migrant workers who fail the test for the first time that they will have time for a basic language course.
In addition, new arrivals without language skills will be offered jobs in areas where active communication with people is not necessary.
Home Office ignores illegal arms market
Percentage of legal guns in crime extremely low
Russia's Interior Ministry plans to tighten gun laws for private gun owners.
In doing so, the authorities are reacting to recent events: Injuries in shootings at weddings and seven deaths in the rampage of the Moscow lawyer Dmitry Vinogradov.
Police want to ban the carrying of non-lethal weapons in public and raise the age for possession of firearms from 18 to 21.
The proposal was supported by Irina Yarovaya, Chairman of the Duma Committee on Security and Anti-Corruption, who promised that the amendments to the arms law would soon be submitted to the Duma.
Not everyone is satisfied that the Russian authorities want to combat the problems by "tightening the screws."
An open letter has been published on the Internet, whose authors - representatives of various gun associations - are calling on the authorities to refrain from "senseless tightening."
The percentage of crimes involving registered weapons is very low, criminal lawyer Vasily Lesnikov told the BBC's Russian service.
According to the statistics of the Ministry of the Interior, 142 crimes involving the use of registered weapons were committed in the course of six months in 2012, while a total of 1.168 thousand crimes were recorded for the same period.
The authors of the open letter are convinced that tightening the law for private gun owners will not deter criminals from using the black market.
At the moment, according to the authors, every possible weapon can be found in Moscow for little money.
Meanwhile, the Interior Ministry stresses that the spread of illegal weapons is under control.
Suppliers: from factories to officers
The weapons reach the black market through several channels.
There are five such main channels, says a former colonel, Viktor Baranez, who spent ten years in the Ministry of Education and the General Staff.
Screenshot of a website that accepts gun orders
The first channel is the army or military, i.e. weapons stolen during fighting in the Caucasus.
"The weapons were stolen by both the Russian officers and the Caucasians themselves," Baranez said.
On the second channel come illegal weapons stolen from law enforcement officers by criminals.
Baranez explains that this includes weapons stolen both from police armoury and directly from law enforcement personnel.
Other illegally sold weapons come from military arms depots.
Explosions were frequent at many military camps.
"There is evidence that in some cases it was arson to cover up the lack of weapons," the former military officer said.
According to Baranez, weapons manufacturers also contribute to the black market.
"Nowadays there are countless private armaments factories that do not stand up to international competition and therefore sell weapons under the radar on the black market, for example in Moscow," reports the expert.
Another channel of the black market is smuggling.
Especially many guns and rifles come from poor countries like Kyrgyzstan.
"They have their own, sometimes artisanal, production and a mafia that organises the smuggling," explains the former military man.
Where did the weapons come from?
Experts calculated the approximate share of each of the five channels in supplying illegal weapons to the black market.
In 2011, a report was prepared by the Centre for Problem Analysis and Public Administration.
Experts analyzed reports of the Interior Ministry and the Federal Service of State Statistics, criminological literature and publicly available data on portals on weapons.
The vast majority of illegal weapons, according to investigators, come from the army and law enforcement agencies.
Half of all weapons on the black market were brought there through the "guilt of those responsible for dealing with weapons in their work," the report said.
According to the researchers' data, 17% of weapons come from conflict zones, 14% are the result of thefts in the production of weapons, and 5% come from illegal excavations.
A sales consultant at a gun store, who did not want to be named, says that weapons found during illegal excavations have long been out of date and no one buys them anymore.
According to him, it is more common for dealers to procure supplies from an arms depot.
An ensign buys a weapon, such as a TT pistol.
The weapon is displayed and passed through the fence.
"The dealer brings the gun into town and sells it for 900 euros apiece with two magazines," he says.
"The police are of course aware of everything and therefore, if they are unable to comply with the crime detection plan, they periodically carry out inspection purchases from dealers offering illegal weapons," the sales consultant adds.
"Like in a luxury store"
Buyers and sellers most often find each other through acquaintances.
I had been looking at websites and blogs when someone came to my attention and suggested that I go to the Begovaya station, where someone would be waiting for me to take me to a certain place, where we could negotiate the price.
I only found out the price of the gun there
Military commentator Viktor Baranets
"To get a gun, I need an acquaintance who has contacts," says the sales consultant. "I have such an acquaintance, but I don't trust him."
There are traders in the markets, but you have to go there and arrange a date with a code like "by Ivan Ivanovich, who tells you that your daughter has lost a tooth."
At the moment, I'm even getting some knuckledusters from an acquaintance I trust.
He only gives me the knuckles because he knows I won't whistle him.
Newcomers are looking for weapons in different ways.
Former military man Viktor Baranez tried to buy illegal weapons in the mid-1990s when he wrote an article on the subject.
According to him, the schemes have not changed.
He was given a photo album showing "all sorts of things."
"I felt like I was in a luxury store," recalls the soldier.
According to Baranez, the buyer does not get the cat in the bag, but can try anything.
As a potential customer, I do not just buy, but drive with the seller into the forest, and there we set up a target.
"I can shoot there, and if I am convinced that the gun has a good shot, we negotiate with each other," the expert describes the procedure.
Shopping from the sofa
Internet search engines show search results for websites and groups in "Vkontakte," where weapons are offered "for various purposes."
No paperwork is required and there are no face-to-face meetings.
"All you need is the right amount of money," says the ad on the "Buy a gun or rifle" website.
There, users place their orders and make inquiries.
Is it also sold to minors?
"Of course without a license," asks user "Ivan" (literal quote).
"Buy a TT. Moscow," is the laconic request from "Fedorenkov."
The Federal Security Service recently shut down myriad bogus websites, and buyers who want to buy guns are flocking to the service.
People come like hungry fish to feed and then end up in Siberia and are allowed to shovel coal

I have heard of the following scheme: the website is normally registered abroad and Russian laws do not apply.
Those responsible accept the orders.
The buyer transfers the money via an ATM.
"In response, he receives a photo and a description of the location of the weapon," reports Dmitry Kislov, press secretary of the non-profit organization "Pravo na oryzhie."
Viktor Baranez emphasizes that you can end up empty-handed and behind bars if you place a request on a website.

A Makarov for $100
According to experts, the cost of buying illegal firearms can range from $100 to $900.
According to Dmitry Kislov of the organization "Pravo na oryzhie" you can buy a Makarov pistol for 100 to 300 dollars.
You have to wait up to a month and a half.
The weapon is issued in military warehouses by wardens of medium rank.
According to the official statistics of the Interior Ministry, the number of crimes involving illegal weapons across Russia decreased by 7% between January and October 2011 to 22.9 thousand, while the number of uncovered cases of theft and extortion related to weapons, ammunition, explosives and explosive devices decreased by 7.8%.
In the US, Fast Food and Supermarket Workers Strike
One in four US teenagers end up behind McDonald's cash register at some point
In recent days, there have been massive protests across the US against low wages at Walmart stores and restaurants in popular fast-food chains such as McDonald's, Burger King, Taco Bell, Wendy's and Kentucky Fried Chicken.
No one can yet predict whether the protests will continue to swell, or whether they will soon run out of steam again.
The protests are supported by labor unions and several left-leaning nonprofits.
In addition to raising the modest wages of rank-and-file Walmart and fast-food workers, protest organizers aim to create unions.
So far, this branch of the economy is hardly unionized.
46 cents a year?
The protests began last week after Thanksgiving, known as Black Friday, which saw sales in the US draw millions of customers, sometimes leading to scuffles.
On that day, some Walmart employees, of whom there are 2.2 million worldwide, quit their jobs and joined unions and left-wing activists in striking branches of the chain that target low- and middle-income people.
Walmart sells everything from diapers to hunting rifles and car batteries to vacuum cleaners, eggs and milk.
Goods in Walmart stores are on average between 8% and 27% cheaper than in large supermarkets.
As a result, many of Walmart's low-paid workers shop only in their own workplaces.
The prices and assortment of goods made Walmart one of the largest companies in the USA.
Critics say Walmart can often sell the merchandise so cheaply only because employees are poorly paid.
The latter also complain about difficult working conditions, such as the lack of forklifts or hand scanners.
Participants in the "Black Friday" protests called for wage increases and expressed anger that the cost of employer-provided health insurance had risen from $30 to $100 a month.
A typical Walmart employee earning $9.5 an hour could not afford the increase, they said.
Researchers from the University of California at Berkeley found that if the company raised the average wage to $12 an hour, it would cost Walmart $3.2 billion.
That's about 1.1% more than they donate for wages now.
If Walmart completely passed on the wage increases to customers, each purchase would cost them just 46 cents more.
That would mean an extra $12.39 a year for them, compared to just $12.39 today.
Supporters of Walmart contentedly note that there were protests in only nine states and that they did not cause the company any losses.
Black Friday lasted at its store from 8pm on Thursday until midnight the next day, and during that period Walmart sold about 5,000 items per second.
In total, Walmart cashiers completed nearly 100 million transactions on Black Friday.
The company's spokesman, Dan Fogelman, claimed in an interview on the left-leaning Huffington Post's website that a total of "fewer than five" Walmart employees were out of work and that the protest action was just "another PR stunt" by the union that organized the protests.
"Free cash!"
The protests continued this week in New York, where their target was not Walmart stores (which are undesirable in this progressive city and thus non-existent), but McDonald's and other low-cost restaurants.
McDonald's says the company sells billions of portions, yet they don't give you sick days and you're not paid for your honest work!
Jumaane Williams, Member of the New York City Council
Currently, under federal and New York law, the minimum wage is $7.25 an hour.
In fast-food restaurants, the minimum wage is gradually being raised, but not too much, and on average, their ordinary New York employees are paid $8.90 an hour.
Nobody in this expensive city earns less than them.
How it is possible to get by on so little money in New York is beyond me.
There was a time when nearly a quarter of all American teenagers worked behind the counter at McDonald's after school, but they still lived with their parents.
Few saw it as their main source of income or planned to stay there longer.
Now, in interviews with McDonald's employees, I constantly come across people who complain that they have to make do with this wage and sometimes even feed their children.
On the other hand, there is a commentary in the forum of the Wall Street Journal, whose author observes that it is irresponsible to have children if you do not know how to feed them.
Participants in the protests, which began at 6: 30 a.m. on Thursday outside McDonald's on 40th Street and Madison Avenue, demanded that cashiers and chefs at fast-food restaurants be paid a minimum wage of $15 an hour, more than double the current minimum wage.
They also called for the formation of trade unions in the fast food industry.
US law prohibits management from standing in the way of this goal and warning or dismissing union members.
On the other hand, management does not make it easy for them.
The establishment of trade unions in the fast food industry is also difficult for objective reasons.
The most important reason is the high turnover of staff.
Discontented
There were also loud protests outside many other fast-food restaurants in Manhattan that day.
The culmination of the protests was a midday rally outside McDonald's in Times Square, where several local Democrats spoke, including City Council member Jumaane Williams, who said, "McDonald's says it sells billions of portions, and yet they don't give you sick days, and you're not paid for your honest work!"
The protesters were also joined by other prominent New York Democrats, such as mayoral candidate Bill De Blasio, who said that "we should work together to support the fast food workers so that they can receive a fair wage and achieve the economic prosperity that every New Yorker deserves!"
According to the New York Times, this was the largest action of its kind in the history of the US fast food industry.
However, there were only a few hundred people on site, far from all of them employed in the fast food industry, which employs tens of thousands in New York.
It is not yet clear whether the spark of these protests will mobilize entire masses.
"The brain can only be tricked moderately so far"
The augmented reality theme, which is popular with followers of modern technology, has lately usually been perceived through the lens of special glasses.
First, Google presented a working model at its annual conference in the summer, then in November it was announced that Microsoft had also applied for a corresponding patent.
However, in a conversation with Shahram Izadi, head of the group on interactive 3D technologies at Microsoft's Cambridge lab, it becomes clear that the glasses were only a transit point for the company's scientists.
It attracts the possibility to manipulate virtual objects in the air with bare hands and to create virtual open spaces.
- Please describe briefly what research your group is doing.
- We deal with the interaction of man and machine, but we want to extend the limits of this interaction.
So far, humanity has largely been stuck in the phase of working with pixels on flat screens, which are sometimes touched.
But we want to look ahead 5-10 years and foresee the radical changes in this interaction.
For example, the Xbox console and Kinect sensors are advancing, and nowadays no Xbox is sold without Kinect, because everyone is interested in motion control.
- What awaits us in the future?
- Although Kinect has taken interaction to a physical level, much still takes place on the flat screen, sometimes in 3D.
The input of information (the system receives more data) could be improved, the output not yet decisive.
We are trying to change that, working on real three-dimensional display systems based on various technologies, including projections.
We need to release the computer world into our physical world and make it more tangible.
However, this requires that not only the user, but also his environment is recognized.
Then we could complement the real world much more easily with virtual objects.
And first of all, let's get rid of these stupid virtual reality helmets!
- What do you think about voice control?
She's popular, but isn't she overrated?
- It is certainly not a universal solution, since it raises questions about privacy, because one does not always want to inform everyone else about one's actions and intentions.
Actually, any kind of interaction with computers is good, but each in its particular niche.
For example, in the field of controlling objects in public places, we were working on a project where we experimented with short and concise gestures rather than expansive gestures.
The gestures were not recorded by the object camera, but by a bracelet that registered the movements of the bones and muscles.
It is still relatively large, but could theoretically be reduced to the size of a wristwatch.
But overall, the future belongs to mixed control types, such as gesture and speech.
How so?
- For example, would you ask me to give you this fizzy drink?
You say it and point it at the same time.
- Usually I just say it.
- Oh, that would be very hard to see.
- Does this mean that you want the user to adapt to what a machine can and cannot accomplish at any given time?
- Not necessarily, but it is a question of rapprochement.
I think that in the near future we will mainly have to work on developing new types of sensors that will make it possible to more accurately record people's reactions.
This can be laser sensors, for example, as they provide a good resolution in depth, which is very important.
- What are your demands on modern cameras based on your work with the Xbox Kinect sensors?
Is there a lack of resolution, depth or something else?
- The current generation is basically a good starting point for our work in the field of three-dimensional recognition.
Of course 8 Megapixels with a speed of 1000 fps would not be bad.
But the main thing is not the megapixels themselves, but the quality of the matrix and the depth.
From this point of view, all current technologies are not good enough for us, as the developers of the algorithms have more work to do.
Not only the resolution along the X and Y axes must be taken into account, but also along the Z axis.
Speed and the number of frames per second are also important.
Human movements are extremely dynamic and, frankly, the current 30 fps is not enough, especially for gestures.
Stephen Betishes developed a touch sensor in our Redmond laboratory with an adjustable processing delay of 1 to 100 milliseconds, with today's commercial sensors closer to the second value (60 to 100).
Not everyone understands how much this affects the interaction between man and machine.
For my work I needed just such a device, just without touch control and with more frames per second.
- Should the number of cameras not be increased?
- Kinect currently works with three "cameras," one of which is actually an infrared transmitter and the second a receiver for the reflected signal.
And the third camera is actually an ordinary RGB camera.
It is not used to calculate the object depth.
More cameras could possibly solve the problem...
Or exacerbate the problem by requiring more calculations.
It would be nice to have a flexible Kinect-like system where we could play with different camera angles to see how this helps us determine a position in three dimensions.
- If I remember correctly, Microsoft, unlike Google, did not present its glasses to the public.
Do you not think that in terms of applying augmented reality technology in everyday life, glasses have the best prospects?
- Of course, it's not pleasant to always have a smartphone in your hand when you're out and about, but I think the best option would be a "changing" augmented reality, where we could switch from glasses to smartphones via a cloud,
The glasses are a personal gadget and therein lies its strength (only you can see private things), but at the same time its weakness, because augmented reality with glasses prevents you from working with others on virtual objects.
- Let us imagine for a moment that the manipulation of virtual holograms in the air is accessible not only to Tony Stark from Iron Man, but also to ordinary mortals.
There is a problem that critics of this idea often point out: there is no tangible response!
The hands feel nothing at all!
What answers does your group intend to give to this objection?
- In my lectures, I often say that augmented reality is the seventh breakthrough in the interaction between man and machine.
I think the eighth breakthrough could well be the integration of tactile perception.
An interesting method is currently the use of the second hand as a somewhat unusual projection surface.
She handles pressure superbly!
But there are also technologies that are actually designed to give something tangible to the "images in the air," for example, the interference of some directed ultrasound beams at a certain point where the finger is, creates a feeling, however weak at the moment, as if someone were blowing over the ball of the hand.
There are also wrist bands that act on nerve endings in the fingers, which is also a potential direction.
- Have you tried to outwit the brain?
Let it think that it feels what it should feel when it sees something?
- This is a good idea, we have not tried it yet.
Hidden here is another task that we will have to contend with for a long time to come, which is to make a person who is physically in an enclosed space believe that he is instead in an open, practically infinite space; here we are working on concepts with treadmills (other than in gyms), movable platforms and large balls.
So far, the brain can be tricked only moderately, and we still have many busy years ahead of us.
This is precisely what makes work in the field of virtual reality so attractive to researchers: we are only at the beginning of many topics.
Own taste instead of culture - rosbalt.ru
Rosbalt continues the project "St. Petersburg Avant-garde," dedicated to city dwellers who form the avant-garde of art and culture.
High-ranking representatives of the St. Petersburg art scene, whose successes extend beyond the borders of the city and who often find recognition in Europe without being known in the rest of Russia, have already landed on the prestigious list.
Rosbalt's new hero is the flamboyant artist Kirill Miller.
The whole city knows Kirill Miller, the bearded man dressed in red, who can be found at the Russian Museum, at the summer garden, at scene meetings or at openings.
Wherever Kirill Miller's paintings are exhibited, they attract large crowds.
Kirill Miller is one of the typical St. Petersburg social-philosophical artists who create new myths.
Kirill Miller is a luminous personality of the St. Petersburg avant-garde in the late 80s and early 90s.
He is also a man of the city, and his presence on the streets puts a smile on the faces of his fellow citizens and makes them feel good.
He recently picked up a barrel organ and became a St. Petersburg barrel organ player, feeling ready for this difficult role in terms of his being an artist, his philosophy and his image.
- Kirill, why are you always in red and not, for example, in yellow or turquoise in the city?
I chose the color red as a fashion designer who deals with the look and image.
In this world, red is the compromise between artist, image consultant and society.
In society, anything that deviates from the gray norm provokes aggression and bad behavior.
But I want to engage with people through my provocations.
Each of my past provocations has been an invitation to talk.
- When did you know you had to become a painter?
- At an exhibition in the Nevsky Palace of Culture, where my works were exhibited.
I realised I had to go down that path.
Then the era of the old free but not officially recognized painters came to an end, and new and free painters like me were incomprehensible.
I became friends with the painters of the new generation, that is, with the representatives of Gazonevshina, which gave rise to Pushkinskaya 10, and that was the end of it.
I'm drawn to theatre, fashion, music, anything but literature.
- And all this came together in your Art Clinic... - It was important to me to be at the centre of St. Petersburg culture, where the best creative artists should gather.
In 1995, I occupied a room at Pushkinskaya 10, and there was a Bohemian Musical and Artistic Club, the House of St. Petersburg Bohemians, until the renovations were completed.
Many were born there: N.O.M., Tequilajazzz, and I also remember how Schnur came there with his project "Ucho Van Goga."
Schnur and his friends sang simple songs for the play-back, wore tight jerseys, and among them was the now-hip composer Igor Wdowin.
When the group started to play live, it became "Leningrad."
Trachtenberg hosted many programs before the time of "Halli-Galli."
We gave them Trachtenberg, and it began his great career, but he learned the basics with us.
The gallery "D 137" or the club "Griboedov" also have their origins in the Art Clinic.
Our staff and regulars went there.
I am a hero of the last century, when culture still meant something.
In 2000, there was a poll in the press asking for the "Personalities of our City" award.
I won in the Artist of the Year category and that was the highlight of my career.
It is not easy to work according to old rules in new times; I am a man of truth, honesty and culture of the past century.
In this day and age, it is easy to become famous, but culture and popularity are not the same thing: you can be famous without making a cultural contribution.
- Your work has an unmistakable style.
- Many of my paintings are real pearls and clearly express the topicality and sharpness of the thoughts.
I will have an exhibition on "The Russian Museum as Clowns."
Clowns are timeless.
I used to be social, but now it hurts and it's scary to be like that.
In a clown, it all blurs and loses its tragedy.
I love the grotesque and I have grotesque ideas.
Let us save the world, for example, by requiring everyone to dress up completely.
Now everyone pays attention to the clothes and orients himself to the outside and not to the inside of the human being.
But perhaps one should not shake a man's hand, but spit in his face.
The deception disappears through disguise.
- Recently we saw you in the role of the urban organ player. - A cultural city should have such a hero.
If not me, then who?
- Can commercial art also be beautiful?
- Nowadays, commercial art has to be careful, considerate and flattering.
We see the disintegration of cultures.
People used to form large groups: the Bohemians loved one thing and the common people loved the other.
Now there are micro-communities, and it is difficult to please everyone.
I'm not a one hundred dollar note that everyone likes.
Now you have to figure out who you're going to like.
Now each cult star has about 100 followers.
- But to the appearances of Stas Mikhailov come several thousand!
- Abandoned women come to him, where the sexual-social sphere plays a role.
For cultural reasons, 300 people are killed, not 10 thousand, so there is less management, less money, and everything goes to waste.
I have followers, and the most important thing is not to deceive them and not to destroy what they have achieved.
In my youth I painted such paintings that one collector even hung in a row with the works of Falk and Larionov.
I started with pictures that usually come at the end of my career.
Nowadays, there are often misunderstandings.
It is called: intellectual culture and consumer culture.
Consumption has no culture at all, that is something quite different.
I am a person of the past culture and I grew up with artists who lived in poverty and died in poverty and refused money in order to be able to paint.
That is the culture I advocate.
- Kirill, what is missing Petersburg?
- Good cultural experts.
They say: servants of culture.
But not all of them can deal with culture.
It was different with the real czars, for the czars may not have understood much about culture, but they understood that real experts were needed.
There are good consultants in Moscow at the moment.
In St. Petersburg, we have some who could be experts, but they are being blocked, because more high-level experts are needed to properly evaluate the former and clear the way for them.
Now all that matters is your own taste.
The same is true of Erarta, but with the difference that they honestly say that they do not accept all contemporary art and that some painters therefore have to look for other museums.
- What is Petersburg for you?
- St. Petersburg is not the Capital of Culture; there is much more culture and breeding ground in Moscow.
Art is difficult to grow on our stones.
We need a cultural breeding ground because, for example, we now have more writers than readers, and that is not right.
In Europe there are many curious people who visit exhibitions or concerts.
With us, it's a lot less.
Art must be modern again, as it was at the beginning of the last century.
The project is financed by grants from the City of Saint Petersburg
Birth in space
Earth in danger.
Global warming or collision with killer asteroid.
Caravans of spaceships with Earthlings on board set out in search of a replacement planet.
In order to save humanity, the important question is how we can reproduce in microgravity or on a substitute planet?
I don't think there are many choices.
In fact, there are only two real planets that we could at least hypothetically inhabit.
"Namely Mars and Venus," says Vladimir Surdin, a research associate at the Astronomical Sternberg Institute.
However, while the conditions on Mars are comparatively life-friendly, the surface of Venus has a temperature of 500 degrees.
Life would only be possible at high altitudes or in the orbit of Venus, i.e. in space.
The researchers first addressed the question of reproduction in space with regard to flora.
Already half a century before, experiments were carried out with plants.
The fourth generation of orbital peas did not differ in the slightest from terrestrial species.
This was followed by the cultivation of insects, more precisely tiny fruit flies (Drosophila), in orbit.
In 1979, quail eggs were sent into space to study how microgravity affects the development of embryos.
A normal chick develops.
But then the problem begins.
"The problem is that the chick has to find its footing; it has to be able to stand on its feet and start moving," explains Vladimir Sychev, head of the laboratory of the Institute of Medical-Biological Problems RAN.
Without a solid surface, the chicks went wild.
Ten hours later, the newborns "instincts were completely blunted.
The chicks did not respond to light and sound.
Four days later, they just died.
"Twice we let chicks hatch and then stopped the whole thing because it is simply impossible to work with them there," Vladimir Sychev says of the failed experiment with the chicks in space.
The last incubator with animals flew into orbit 16 years ago.
The experiments will continue in spring 2013.
However, only same-sex species will be on the "Bion" biosatellite.
There was an experiment with rats that had already been sent into space.
In principle, nothing special was found.
"That was just with the biosatellites, but again it was just a single experiment, and the research needs to continue," Vladimir Sychev observes.
After landing, the space rats gave birth to offspring.
The problem of reproduction directly in space has not yet been solved.
The task is difficult.
Animals that are uprooted from their natural habitat simply cannot follow their reproductive instinct.
Unlike animals, humans could do this in principle.
Homo sapiens is capable of abstract thinking and can create a similar emotional background.
For ethical reasons, such experiments are not carried out.
But women have been flying into space for 50 years.
Tereshkova was the biggest risk.
The most valuable thing that mankind possesses is the female organism.
Our seagull flew away, and no one on Earth could have answered the question: Does it survive the space flight?
Will she be able to give birth to a child after this flight?
"After all, no one answered that question," said space veteran Vakhtang Vachnadze.
In June 1964, just one year after her space flight, the first female cosmonaut, Valentina Tereshkova, gave birth to a daughter.
The child's father, Andriyan Nikolaev, was also a cosmonaut.
In 1988, the second woman in space, Svetlana Savitskaya, who has been in orbit twice and even worked outside the spacecraft, gave birth to a son.
Still, there remains a risk.
We have very few cosmonauts where everything went well after long flights and they had healthy offspring.
"The more, the more dangerous it is even when flying into orbit," concludes cosmonaut Valery Polyakov, hero of the Soviet Union and hero of the Russian Federation.
Yet humanity must seek new avenues in biotechnology, radiation protection and the creation of artificial gravity.
The Hydrolaboratory in the Cosmonaut Preparation Center is an obligatory station during flight preparation.
Here, in a state of limbo, the cosmonauts gain routine work in open space.
Water represents weightlessness.
Even if adults find water pleasant, it is a foreign environment; but infants perceive water as a natural element.
It is as if the little ichthyanders bear witness to life on land emerging from the ocean.
There is a connection between the fact that a child is in the amniotic fluid in the mother's belly for about 9 months and the fact that it is then easier to get used to water.
In principle, this is logical, since only 2 weeks pass from birth until the first swim.
"This is not enough time to forget something," says baby swimming instructor Marina Aksenova.
So while weightlessness is a much more natural state for a newborn child, a woman cannot do without gravity.
In a state of weightlessness, the abdominal and pelvic muscles deteriorate enormously quickly and the ability to squeeze the child out also decreases.
Well, let's get around that by introducing birth control aids.
The birth could also take place, for example, in a special chamber to squeeze the child out.
"But what happens then?" is Valery Polyakov's not insignificant question.
On the other hand, the child also needs artificial gravity.
Without feeling the gravitational pull, the organism cannot develop the skeleton and muscles.
A newborn child cannot be put into an exercise suit in orbit like an adult.
He will simply lack what is of fundamental importance to his life.
"This experiment, which we are carrying out together, namely the birth of a child in a foreign environment, will lead to the birth of a handicapped person, a completely unadapted person," predicts Igor Pestov, head of the Bioethics Commission of the Institute of Medical-Biological Problems RAN.
Until now, the birth of children in space has been mere theory.
Eventually, however, it becomes reality when the inhabitants of Earth set off in their spaceships to a distant planet that becomes the home of their offspring born in space.
NKÚ chief: Control of the black system fails through the fault of politics
The Czech Republic has good supervisory bodies and adequate laws in relation to public contracts, but falls behind in their application.
Speaking to Aktuálně.cz, Miloslav Kala, Vice-President of the Supreme Control Office (NKÚ), said so.
"A law is never perfect, but it must be applied correctly - and I do not think this is the case for us," Kala comments on the current situation.
A similar conclusion appears to have been reached by a joint inspection by Czech and German auditors.
As a negative practical example, he cites the attitude of Prime Minister Petr Nečas to the so-called "black system."
Recently, the Prime Minister said that ODS would not bother entrepreneurs with controls - so is the system now banned or allowed?
"A law must be valid, and if something is forbidden by law, then the head of the government cannot simply come and obstruct the work of the supervisory office, whose duty is to monitor compliance with the law," Kala observes.
At the meeting of the Control Committee of the Chamber of Deputies, you spoke about a joint Czech-German project comparing the laws of both countries on public procurement.
What was that all about?
This is a parallel review that we started about two years ago.
Simply put, it is a matter of the European legislature determining how public contracts are to be handled, and this is the basis of national legislation, and finally, there is the actual practical application.
We have compared all this and, although the audit has not yet been completed, we have seen some very interesting differences. Generally speaking, the laws in our country are perhaps even a little bit more "rigorous and perfect," but the actual application is better in Germany in some parameters.
This confirms that it is not enough to keep drawing up new and more precise rules, and that we also need to look at the actual application of the law.
To what extent can the project be of help to you? What will result from this project for you?
It is precisely this kind of joint control that could help us to stop constantly striving to perfect the laws and to lower and balance thresholds, when this does not seem to have a particularly positive effect.
Profitability means acquiring something at a reasonable price (which is not always the lowest price) and preventing unlawful enrichment or even criminal activity.
However, lowering thresholds for contracts does not guarantee that we will achieve this objective.
Perhaps it is even the case that in this way we burden the system only with excessive "paperwork," and those who seek loopholes in the system find it much easier to exploit the system than if the thresholds remained higher.
You talk about the problems with the practical implementation of the Czech public procurement law.
How does the control system work in Germany?
Is there a similar authority to our NKÚ, or does the system work differently?
As far as the authorities are concerned, the German equivalent of the NKÚ is the Federal Court of Auditors, which is structured in a similar way to ours and also has a college which is only formed slightly differently. However, in principle, both authorities operate in a similar way.
The competences are also comparable to a certain extent, but Germany is a federal state, which means that these courts of auditors also exist in the individual federal states - in that respect, the German system differs from ours.
The BRH is only allowed to control federal funds, which corresponds to our state resources.
Public funds, which are administered by the districts and municipalities in our country, are subject to the control of the state audit offices.
As far as German legislation is concerned, is it simpler than ours?
Generally speaking, I would be reluctant to compare this without specific data. Nevertheless, in some respects, Germany is often referred to as a role model, although it certainly cannot be said that Germany is better in everything.
Is this perhaps because the auditors are better there?
Certainly not, but as I said, I don't like comparisons like that very much.
It should also be noted that even those countries which are an example to us are also experiencing problems.
Otherwise, they would have nothing to gain from cooperating with our authority, would they not?
As far as Czech legislation is concerned, what significance did the amendment of the Public Procurement Act have for your authority, do you already feel any effects?
In view of the fact that this amendment has only been in force for a short time, it has not yet had an impact on our audits.
As our inspections are carried out retrospectively, a certain delay is to be expected here.
So far, we have had an impact more in the preparatory phase of future controls - for example, we have introduced the new 'uneconomic risk detection' tool, which audits and analyses almost 14,000 public contracts - where, of course, the changes will have an impact, as the thresholds change, the conditions for certain types of tenders have been modified, and so on.
Do you see the adoption of this law as rather positive, or will the system be burdened with more bureaucracy?
I think that this law is certainly a step in the right direction and I hope that this adoption will be confirmed.
However, the problem may arise that the rules become "stricter" and can no longer be observed.
Under the previous rules, persons subject to audit are accountable to the institution (for example, in the case of a regional policy operational programme, the Regional Council) in such a way that any failure to comply with the Public Procurement Act is tantamount to a breach of budgetary discipline.
But then, is it sensible to make the law even stricter?
I don't think so.
The system must exclude those who want to attack and abuse the system, not punish those who have made a formal error that does not affect the actual decision-making process.
Such a system only puts more pressure on bureaucracy.
Where is the way out?
First of all, let us say which way is not the right one.
The Prime Minister recently said that the ODS would not bother entrepreneurs with controls of the so-called "black system" - what does that mean exactly?
Is the black system now prohibited or allowed?
After all, a law must be valid, and if something is prohibited by law, then surely the President of the Government cannot simply come and obstruct the work of the Supervisory Office, whose duty is to monitor compliance with the law.
He can say, "We are changing the law and allowing it," but he cannot say that we are acting as if nothing is happening.
The Public Procurement Act contains relatively strict rules on the formal execution of certain transactions - and that is right for the protection of public competition.
On the other hand, however, it is also tragic if the bidder with the best offer is excluded purely on the basis of form errors.
The law will never be perfect, but it must be applied correctly - and that, in my opinion, is what we lack.
On the roads there is occasional icy frost, but mostly they are dry.
The roads in the Czech Republic are partially covered with snow and ice.
Mostly, however, the roads are well passable, sometimes increased caution is required.
Carlsbad
Roads in the Karlovy Vary district were well passable this morning, with occasional icy and snowy conditions.
Temperatures dropped to -5 to -10 ° C, during the day it is expected to get a little warmer.
Snow is no longer falling in the region, and only a thin blanket of snow remains at lower altitudes.
On the ridges of the Ore Mountains, however, there are about 30 cm of snow.
Visibility was limited due to fog, according to the county highway patrol.
The R6 expressway and the first-class roads in the region are currently fully passable.
Attention should, however, be paid to bridges, for example, where the roads are sometimes icy and slippery.
All roads of the second and third class, including mountain roads, are also passable.
However, sections of these roads remain covered with icy or runaway snow.
Particularly at higher altitudes, therefore, increased attention is required.
Pardubice and Hradec Králové districts
On some roads in Eastern Bohemia there is a risk of icy conditions, at higher altitudes and in the mountains there is still a layer of snow on the roads, the Roads and Motorways Directorate informs on its website.
Road maintenance services warn drivers of icy conditions, which can occur especially at higher altitudes in the Pardubice district.
Icy conditions can occur especially on second and third class roads in Lanškroun, Ústí nad Orlicí, Polička, Svitavy and Vysoké Mýto counties.
Roads I / 43 and I / 34 near Svitavy are chemically treated.
Snow lies especially on roads in the Giant Mountains and Orlické hory.
There is a thick layer of snow at high altitudes on the roads of Rychnov nad Kněžnou and Trutnov districts.
In Eastern Bohemia it is mostly sunny or sunny today, and it remains largely precipitation-free.
Temperatures range between -3 and + 1 ° C, with a light breeze.
Pilsen District
Roads in the Pilsen district are nowadays well passable, but locally increased attention is required and the driving style has to be adapted to the weather.
This is frosty in the morning, with temperatures between 3 and 9 degrees below freezing.
As it has snowed before and the temperatures have subsequently dropped, the roads can be icy.
Fog is also expected locally, although visibility will improve during the day.
This information comes from the district road maintenance.
The D5 motorway is practically unrestricted, but the road maintenance services recommend increased attention between the 80th and 131st kilometres.
First-class carriageways are mostly dry, but frozen.
In the south of Pilsen and Tachov counties, however, there may be some icy conditions.
The second and third class carriageways are wet, and therefore the warning of possible icy sections applies here as well.
Drivers should be especially careful on the less frequented roads in the Bohemian Forest area.
Olomouc District
Drivers travelling towards the high altitudes in the Olomouc region must expect snow slush today.
After the use of gritters, slush remains on the Červenohorské sedlo pass and on the road in the direction of Videlský kříž.
Overnight snowfall forced road maintenance services to deploy, and about 3 cm of fresh snow fell in Sumperk County, according to the Highway Administration.
In the remaining areas of the district, the roads are mostly fully passable.
"There are still remnants of snow in the Šumperk region at high altitudes.
Drivers on the Červenohorské sedlo pass in the direction of Jeseník must expect slush, "a Šumperk Road Administration employee told the ČTK agency today.
Her colleagues in the Jeseník region also had to go out at night. According to her, the roads up to the high altitudes are clear and wet after chemical treatment.
Roads in Olomouc County are fully passable, but in Šternberk County drivers must drive carefully in sections of forest, as the roads here are still wet.
Ústí nad Labem district, Liberec district
In Northern Bohemia, the road maintenance services report several sections of road that are difficult to drive on.
According to the traffic police, the mountain road from Telnice to Knínice in the Ústí n.K. district is closed in addition to several places with snow or icy conditions.
Temperatures will remain below zero even at lower altitudes, so snow and ice will remain on the roads. However, no problems have been reported from the lowlands, especially to the southeast of the Bohemian Central Mountains, and roads are generally dry there.
No traffic disruptions have been reported so far.
Icy conditions are reported in particular from the Štětí area.
According to meteorologists, the conditions were ideal at night - rain and melting snow during the day, and cloudless skies and frost at night.
Poor traffic conditions are reported on the main routes as well as on the I / 13 road on the border of the Ústí n.L. and Liberec districts.
The road between Telnice and Knínice was closed due to branches pushed onto the road by the snow load.
Šimon Ornest: We want to gather positive energy at our concerts
What do you think about the fact that in less than a month the end of the world is to take place?
This is one of those disaster messages that we humans are so fond of jumping on.
With our band The Tap Tap we rather make fun of it and say that we are the only band in the world that can gather enough positive energy to stop or prevent the end of the world.
In December you will also realize a unique project with three concerts against the end of the world.
Can you introduce the project to our readers?
It's a nationwide fundraiser that we've been planning for two years.
For this we want to use the marketing potential of the Mayan calendar, the end of which is predicted for the 21st of December at 11: 10 in the morning.
The day before, i.e. 20 December, three concerts will take place simultaneously in Prague, Brno and Ostrava from 21: 00.
The end of the concerts is supposed to be around the time when the Mayan calendar ends on the Pacific island of Kiribati, which is 12 hours ahead of us in a time zone.
Who came up with the idea?
Originally probably by me, then we designed the idea together with our graphic designer Honza Augusta.
Not only do we want to gather enough positive energy to prevent the end of the world, but we also want to reflect, together with the public, on the state in which we are going to hand over this world to our children.
On the occasion of the end of the Mayan calendar, we have also developed a unique collection of shoes, T-shirts, bags and key rings against the end of the world, which people can also support us with their purchase through www.e-tap.cz.
The band The Tap Tap, together with other performers, also recorded the so-called hymn against the end of the world with the title "Doomsday falls out."
The anthem is already very popular on YouTube. Will it also resound at the benefit concerts?
Of course, and at the very end, provided that everything works out and the end of the world does not take place...
The hymn is to be sung by all performers at all three concerts simultaneously.
In addition, the anthems will be broadcast live on Czech television.
The lyrics of the hymn are by Tomáš Hanák, who also plays the main character of Jesus in the video clip, Xindl X also sings along...
How did you come to work with both of them?
We also cooperate with other personalities of the Czech cultural scene, which is due to the fact that we organize many benefit events and concerts...
We strive to involve these people intensively in our projects.
It turned out that most of them are interested in working with us and enjoy it.
What is the purpose of the proceeds of the concerts against the end of the world?
For the establishment of the barrier-free educational centre Studeo, on which we have been working for six years together with the Tap Association at the Jedlička Institute.
The students of the Jedlička Institute are regularly supervised by lecturers who help them with various leisure activities.
Since the students themselves do not have the means to visit the lecturers, we would like to help them in this way.
As part of the completion of the Jedlička Institute, a separate building will be built, which we will move into with this project.
Several groups and performers perform at each concert.
What criteria did you use to select them?
We wanted to put together a programme that would appeal to all generations, including children.
Chinaski, Support Lesbiens, Illustratosphere with Dan Bárta, The Tap Tap, Marián Bango and Jiří Suchý will perform in Prague.
For more information, please visit www.kpks.cz.
Are similar "major events" planned for the future?
In May, we will perform at the Prague Spring for the first time, and we are also preparing an interesting program for this concert with interesting guests.
Next year we would also like to perform at the Czech House in New York, and I personally - when we are already in the USA - would like to combine this with performances in Washington and Chicago.
Your plans abroad are not exactly small, you have already performed in Madrid, Brussels, London or Moscow.
However, The Tap Tap is a group made up of people with disabilities.
How do you manage these trips logistically and organizationally?
It's not as bad as it seems at first glance.
Five of our members are wheelchair users, i.e. the wheelchairs have to be transported in the luggage compartment. Of course, we also have to carry many instrument cases and other luggage...
Nevertheless, it has always worked without any problems, ČSA and British Airways have always been very well prepared for us, and sometimes I have wondered.
Even in Moscow, where we were recently, there were no problems.
Through your trips abroad, you will have a comparison of the situation in individual countries with accessibility, how people with disabilities are treated there, and so on.
How have you experienced these things so far?
After Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other cities where everything works better than here, we have just witnessed in Russia that everything is still in its beginnings in the East.
Compared to Prague, Moscow is not wheelchair accessible at all, where it is still unusual for someone in a wheelchair to travel alone in the city centre.
It is not even a matter of course to let a wheelchair user in, for example, an elevator.
Fortunately, associations are also being set up there, which are trying to draw attention to the problems of people with disabilities.
And in what respect do we need to catch up with the more developed countries?
There are still a lot of things in which we are lagging behind...
It should also be noted, however, that an improvement in the situation always depends on the efforts of those affected.
In London and Madrid, it is absolutely common for people with severe disabilities to be able to move independently in public spaces, go to museums, use toilets, etc.
However, it is not very common for a large group of disabled people to take an active part in social events there. In this respect, we are a little ahead of the West with the band The Tap Tap!
Public respect and accessibility is one thing, but it is only when great athletes, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers come out of our ranks that things will really start to change.
So far these are only isolated cases of particularly strong-willed personalities.
The Tap Tap is very popular at the moment, but if we go back a few years, what motivated you to form a band in 1998?
At that time, I started as a supervisor at the Jedlička Institute, where I met many young people who were interested in something intense.
And since I am a musician myself and play the saxophone, I founded a music group together with a colleague.
Well, and over time, as our moderator, Láďa Angelovič, is wont to say, it got a bit out of control (laughs).
But the band only became known in the last few years, or am I mistaken?
It is true that working with well-known singers has helped us; moreover, we have also started to actively promote ourselves.
We have become aware that if you do something and it is not visible to the outside world, your own performance does not exist in a certain sense.
Thanks to EU funding, we can also afford good editors, high-quality equipment and the like.
Was your goal to get this far with The Tap Tap?
From the beginning, I felt the potential to approach things differently.
In showbusiness these days, one often copies the other.
This is logical in its own way, because anything new is viewed with caution and only accepted after a long time.
There are few truly unique things, and I dare say that Tap Tap is one of them.
The first impression the viewer usually has is of course pity; that is only natural...
But this compassion is absolutely superfluous, because people with disabilities are not lonely and abandoned beings that we should feel sorry for.
They are people who can live and develop a full life, provided they have the means to do so.
I always say that if people with disabilities succeed, it is not only progress for themselves, but for society as a whole.
Was it also helpful for this success that you are a strict boss, as many people say?
If you want to do something well, you must not compromise on many things and you must also demand a certain discipline.
In my opinion, however, this is perfectly normal.
Some come to us with romantic ideas, and when they discover that they have rehearsals twice a week, have to complete preparation phases and spend a lot of time on concert tours, the enthusiasm of many quickly disappears.
But that's how it works everywhere, in any band that wants to work seriously and achieve something.
The Tap Tap currently has twenty members.
How many of them have been there since the beginning, i.e. since 1998?
Only one: Láďa Angelovič.
We are an open group. People come and go. You can't prevent that.
Whoever has the will and the desire to participate is always welcome with us.
Takes place the day before the predicted end of the world, Thursday the 20.12.2012 at 9 p.m.
Venues are: Incheba Arena / Prague, Fléda / Brno and Plynojem / Ostrava; 12 Czech bands and other musicians
All three venues will be connected to each other at the end of the concert and a joint interpretation of the band The Tap Tap's anthem "Weltuntergang fällt aus" will be played.
The aim of the concert is to raise funds to equip a multifunctional educational centre for handicapped people, which will be established under the name STUDEO in the Jedlička Institute in Prague. Cost: CZK 25 million.
Entrance costs 400 CZK, children up to 12 years free of charge, tickets are available in advance at Bohemia Ticket.
Poland and outer space.
Last week, at a Council of Ministers meeting of the member countries of the European Space Agency (ESA), Poland became the twentieth member of the space agency, making it the second member country from the former Eastern Bloc (after the Czech Republic, which became an ESA member on 12 November 2008).
Poland started a close cooperation with ESA in 1994 and participated in several ESA projects in the following years.
Poland's journey into space began much earlier, of course.
Even before the Second World War, Polish cosmos enthusiasts were occupied with space travel, although they did not always meet with understanding.
I recall, for example, the lecture given by A. Šternfeld on 6 December 1933 at the Warsaw Observatory, at which the author presented ideas from his pioneering work "Entrance to Cosmonautics."
However, the ideas of the young engineer (born in 1905) left the audience cold, and years later Šternfeld remembered that only Dr. Jan Gadomski had shown interest in his work.
Šternfeld won the Prix REP-Hirsch donated by Robert Esnault-Pelterie and André Louis Hirsch for "Entrance to Cosmonautics" in 1934.
Dr. Jan Gadomski (1899 - 1966) later became an important advocate of astronomy and space travel.
He published hundreds of articles in Polish journals and wrote several books on these scientific disciplines.
Gadomski's globally recognized contribution to the development of space travel was recognized, among other things, by the fact that one of the craters on the far side of the moon was named after him.
As early as 1925, a railway trolley was built in Poland, for which a rocket engine was planned.
Unfortunately, the author of the draft and the details of this project remained unknown.
It is not even clear whether the rocket should be used to start or brake the trolley.
The information on this comes exclusively from the contemporary press.
In 1933, the Polish infantry began to deal with rocket-propelled projectiles.
The research was conducted by the Komórka Techniki Uzbrojenia Institute in collaboration with Prof. Mieczyslaw Wolfke and Prof. Gustaw Mokrzyckiegi.
It is clear from the surviving documents that research had reached the stage of practical testing.
The research was then interrupted by the invasion of the German Wehrmacht.
In 1937, a design of a photoelectric hunting rocket by Ing. Rohoziński appeared in the trade press, and the following year the book Rakieta - torpeda powietrzna i rakietobomba lotnicza (Rakieta - torpeda powietrzna i rakietobomba lotnicza) by the author Leliwa-Krzywoblocky was published.
Both projects dealt with the military use of the rocket propulsion system.
Shortly before the war, all projects for the military use of missile technology were coordinated by the Temporary Scientific Advisory Committee (Tymczasowy Komitet Doradczo-Naukowy).
The committee was established in 1937, but after two years its work was terminated at the beginning of the war.
Further articles on space travel appeared in the Polish press after the war thanks to the work of the Polish Space Society (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautyczne).
The company was first mentioned in 1954 in the November issue of Problemy magazine, in which four extensive articles are devoted to space travel.
The article by Prof. M. Subotowicz proposes the establishment of a space company.
At that time, the first projects on satellite technology were already underway, and it was foreseeable that space exploration would have a future.
Right from its beginnings in 1956, the Polish Space Association (PTA) tried to join the International Space Federation (IFS), which was founded in 1951, and in fact the PTA became a full member as early as autumn 1956.
The following year, the first chairman of the PTA, Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902-1959), became vice-chairman of the International Space Federation.
He held this position until his death in 1959.
Since 1956, the PTA has played a major role in the development of the extremely successful meteorological rocket (Rakieta Meteorologiczna), the first Polish rocket for scientific research.
The first type, the RM-1, was completed in 1957, the first launch took place on 10 October 1958.
The rocket, with a maximum altitude of 1800 m, was about 80 cm long and weighed less than 5 kg.
Later, an improved version, the RM-1A, was built, and in 1959 flight tests with the two-stage RM-2 rocket began in the Błędów Desert.
The rocket was 1.4 meters long and weighed about 11.5 kg.
A further stage of development should already be able to do real scientific work - the RM-34 rocket should reach an altitude of up to 14.5 km and be used for the observation of high-altitude winds.
In 1962, however, further development was stopped.
The Meteor-1 rocket, developed between 1962 and 1965, was the successor to the first RM rocket.
The rocket was designed as a two-stage rocket, with a total length of 510 cm and a launch weight of 32.5 kg.
Three types of this rocket were developed (Meteor-1A, -1B and -1C), which differed from each other in the size of the transport space for scientific instruments.
The Meteor-1A rocket had a transport capacity of 0.4 litres, Meteor-1B had a capacity of 0.34 litres and Meteor-1C had a capacity of 0.62 litres.
The maximum altitude for all three types was 37 km.
Between 1965 and 1968, the Meteor-2 rocket was developed at the Aviation Institute, the first flight tests of which began in October 1970.
Meteor-2 had a take-off weight of 380 kg and was able to carry a payload of 10 kg to an altitude of about 60 km.
Afterwards the versions Meteor-2H and Meteor-3 were built.
It is also worth mentioning Poland's accession to COSPAR (Committee for Space Research) in 1960, which was followed two years later by the establishment of a national COSPAR committee.
Poland also participated in space exploration with Soviet satellites as part of the Interkosmos programme, and in 1978 Polish pilot Miroslaw Hermaszewski became the second intercosmonaut after Vladimír Remek of the Czech Republic.
Repealing the Public Works Act is not a solution.
Last week, the Constitutional Court annulled the Law on Public Works.
The decision provoked a lively public debate.
It is certainly interesting to look at the problem from a broader perspective.
The liberal economic systems in the EU and in the globalised world are based on the principle of unregulated economic competition.
Ultimately, this means that individual economies are in permanent conflict with each other.
This is due to the principle of free trade and the free, unrestricted movement of private capital, which goes hand in hand with unbridled financial speculation.
Price tensions arise due to the large differences in the value of labour (wages).
This term refers to a situation in which the manufacturer tries to compete economically by importing favourable goods, by "undercutting" the competition in order to seize a larger market share and increase his profit.
On a large scale, this means for most companies to move production abroad, or to buy cheaply, or to go out of business, resulting in high unemployment in countries with comparably high labor costs.
Since private capital has no social responsibility and therefore no responsibility for the unemployment it causes, public expenditure necessarily increases.
This situation is exacerbated by the fact that the entrepreneurs are absolutely unwilling to pay their taxes, thereby compensating for the economic and social damage they have caused to society as a whole.
This situation is well known, so there is no need for specific statistics at this point.
The ruthless practice of private capital creates a situation in individual economies in which governments are forced to compete with each other in order to artificially lower the social level of their own population and thus attract foreign capital into the country.
In other words, governments are leaving their own people at the mercy of private capital, regardless of the social consequences.
This is reflected in particular in changes to existing laws.
The aim of these measures is to force their own people to accept the dictates of private capital, particularly in the area of wages.
This is done, on the one hand, by economic constraint and long-term unemployment, and, on the other, by curtailing workers' rights.
The result is growing poverty, as well as widening disparities between rich and poor.
For several years now, there have been public food distribution points in Germany for the poor, who are no longer able to feed themselves through their own work.
The number of people affected is already in the millions.
In the course of increasing the competitiveness of the German economy, cases regularly arise in which employees receive such low wages that the state has to top up their income to the subsistence level.
Such a scandal has also been exposed in the case of auxiliary staff employed in the German Bundestag.
The austerity measures of practically all EU southern states will no doubt amount to the same situation where people, under the pressure of a catastrophic fall in their social standards, are forced to emigrate (as was the case in the nineteenth century) or starve for a pittance on the fringes of society, hoping that private investment capital will eventually flow into the country.
Here the question naturally arises, where does this capital come from?
When it comes from another EU country, only poverty migrates from one country to another; or capital is left out altogether, because in China, India, Brazil, Turkey, Morocco or Egypt, or in Africa in general, workers work for a fraction of European wages.
This concerns the whole of Latin America.
Liberal theories and the media claim to the point that the state must not participate with capital in its own economy, and that planned economy leads to economic catastrophe.
Private capital is blinkered in its view that the state must not intervene in the economy in a steering way.
But then one has to ask oneself whether private capital does not influence or even direct politics and thus the entire state in its own selfish sense.
Here's the clear answer: Yes.
The proof of this is the existence of a lobby that is practically all-powerful and ubiquitous in all states.
The result is a desperate situation in the area of corruption, of mutual advantage, of legislation in which practically everything is criminal, but nothing is punishable.
In Germany, the situation is such that, for lack of finance, a state ministry entrusts private legal firms closely linked to industry with the drafting of draft laws.
These bills are then passed in the Bundestag.
All violence then no longer comes from the people, as the Western constitutions proclaim, but from strong financial groups that prefer their own interests.
Apparently, the liberal democracies are rapidly finding themselves in a situation similar to that described by Appian in his work on the crisis of the Roman Republic in the time of Caesar and Pompey: "The state had been decaying for a long time, and the offices were filled with violence.
Against bribes, by unlawful sneaking of benefits or with stone and sword.
Corruption was rampant, and the people went to the polls with votes they had already bought... "" People of character did not run for office, so that, as a result of this decline, the state had no consul for eight months... "" People really began to talk about the fact that the only medicine in this difficult situation was autocracy, and that a strong man had to be elected... "Appian was thinking of Pompey, but the strongman was Caesar, who permanently replaced democracy with autocracy.
As can be seen, today's society, as in antiquity, is founded on a ruthless preference for one's own advantage, without paying attention to the interests of society as a whole.
Private capital, by its very nature, is incapable of recognizing and enforcing the advantage for society as a whole.
The result, now as then, is an unprecedented decadence of elites who are not in the least committed to deeper reforms.
We must therefore look for the cause of the rise of fascism and communism in the ruthless liberalisation of economic systems in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries.
As things stand, the demise of these regimes in favour of liberal democracies can be seen as a certain pause, with the next round looming.
Particularly catastrophic is the fact that today's elites are completely ignorant of the possible loss of hundreds of thousands of lives in the future, the humanitarian and social catastrophes of which we are already witnessing today, and the crimes against humanity as we know them from past and recent history.
The repeal of the Public Works Act is not a solution, at least not a permanent one.
Under the pressure of global and European economic competition, the Czech Republic will be forced to continue to look for ways to lower the social level of the population.
This trend is therefore systemic.
The only solution is targeted political and social reforms that increase the state's capital participation in the economy, increase citizens "influence on the government, and weaken the monopoly position of private capital in society in favor of the state.
Israel: Laboratory of chaos.
... "that nothing arises from violence, or could ever arise," Sting sings in the song Fragile, the main verse of which is:... "lest we forget how fragile we are."
"If my sons did not want wars, there would be none," says the dying Gutele Schnaper, wife of Mayer Amschel Rothschild, in 1849.
After the latest wave of violence between Israel and the Gaza Strip, there was, as always, a great deal of reaction.
Some stand behind Israel and argue with its right to self-defense, while others call the Palestinians terrorists; others support the Palestinians, argue with the racism of the Israeli state, with the genocide committed against the Palestinian Arabs, and call the State of Israel terrorist.
I do not want to write here about who is responsible and who is the victim in these recurring waves of killings; after all, today's inhabitants of Israel, including the self-governing territories, were born into the current political situation and did not witness the beginning of the violence itself.
My aim is to give readers a behind-the-scenes look at who the 95 years of tension (starting with the Balfour Declaration in November 1917) in this small corner of the Middle East are serving.
My thoughts are partly based on accessible historical facts, others are derived from them and come from my own understanding of who or which group of people has a significant influence on the events of modern history.
The history of humanity is first and foremost a history of the struggle for power.
In every epoch we can see an Alexander the Great or a Napoleon.
What is less obvious is the question of whether it was really always these personalities themselves who autonomously determined their steps, or whether behind their throne there was someone who directed their actions to a predetermined goal.
We must acknowledge that we live in a time when the world's wealth is concentrated in the hands of a few individuals, and that this concentration of money and the power that comes with it did not come about within the lifespan of a generation.
Among these astronomically rich families, one stands out that could be described as the head of the octopus (I don't know if there is anyone standing above them, but I don't rule it out) - the Rothschilds.
Not much is written about them.
Understandably so.
The first press agency (Reuters) was bought by the Rothschilds as early as the nineties in order to prevent the association of their name with highly criminal acts, in the background of which was always the consolidation of their power, the increase of their wealth or both.
The Rothschilds are involved in almost every central bank in the world, and they wage or are preparing for wars against countries in which they are not involved (before the invasion of Afghanistan there were 7 countries, after the invasion of Iraq there were 5 countries, after the fall of Gaddafi there were only four left, with Russia subordinating its central bank to the Russian government in the meantime).
Whoever tried to stand up to this family had to pay with their lives.
Abraham Lincoln refused to renew Rothschild's Bank of America status as a central bank, began issuing his own (read: government) notes during the Civil War, and was assassinated in a theater in 1865.
J.F. Kennedy began to issue his own banknotes and wanted to abolish the FED - he was assassinated in 1963; Representative Louis McFadden was poisoned in 1936 after suing the FED for triggering the Great Depression in 1929.
From 1859 to 1871, the Rothschilds "global lust for power led to the formulation of a plan to unleash three world wars by Albert Pik, a Freemason of the 33rd and thus the highest degree of knowledge.
The first war was to eliminate the great monarchist states of Europe, the second war was to break the colonial rule of Great Britain in particular, and the third war was to reduce the world population to about 0.5-1 billion people (such a number would provide for their conveniences and luxury and would not consume as many resources), create a universal religion (ecumenism is nothing more than a prelude) and finally lead to the assumption of absolute power.
The method by which the group of the richest families, headed by the Rothschilds, works is to trigger a crisis and then offer a solution (order ab chao - order out of chaos).
These solutions, however, are wrong and always lead to a worsening of the situation (see the creation of the Federal Reserve so that crises such as the one they triggered in 1907 do not happen again).
Having succeeded in triggering the First World War through the assassination of Ferdinand, heir to the Habsburg throne, in Sarajevo, they destroyed the Russian tsarist empire through the Bolshevik revolution.
The First World War ended with the sudden capitulation of Germany without any military or economic justification (the war was no longer necessary for the destruction of the Russian tsarist empire), followed by the dissolution of the great Central European power of Austria-Hungary.
In order to make the Second World War easier to ignite, the bankers created a latent conflict situation through politics by imposing gigantic war reparations on Germany, thereby creating the precondition of impoverished masses, so that they only had to cheer on the Germans with a sufficiently strong leader to name the culprits and offer simple solutions; another factor was the creation of the multi-ethnic state of Czechoslovakia with a strong German minority, which was to take on the function of a fifth column and also assumed the function of fanning the conflagration.
At the end of the 19th century, the Rothschilds initiated the establishment of the Zionist movement, in which one branch sought to establish a Jewish state, preferably in the historical territory of Judea with Jerusalem as its capital (return to Zion).
The aforementioned Balfour Declaration created the conditions for the mass immigration of Jews to Palestine; there were the first clashes with the local Arab population.
There have been terrorist attacks on both sides.
The Second World War broke out, and whether Hitler broke free from the chain that international bankers had initially held him in, or whether everything went according to plan, is difficult to estimate; in any case, the suffering of European Jews in the concentration camps created the prerequisite for the recognition of the Jewish state by the world community.
Israel was founded in 1948, and just as the war reparations against Germany prepared the ground for World War II, the proclamation of the State of Israel constitutes the focal point for World War III.
If the international bankers succeed in unleashing this war, the Jewish people will fall victim to the front line, as they did in World War II, this time along with the Arab and Muslim populations of the Middle East.
Israel is like a vast laboratory, a source of controversy and chaos, not only within the country itself, but also internationally (consider how sharply people divide into adherents and adversaries of Israel).
Who is the culprit and who is the victim in the conflict between Palestinians and Israelites, where injustice only triggers injustice in an endless spiral of violence, starting with the greed of individuals and their quest for global power?
A distinction must be made here between the inhabitants of Israel and their leaders, for the international bankers in Israel, as well as here, the people, only put their own candidates to the vote.
The current Prime Minister of Israel, the hawk Netanyahu, is a typical example of a politician prone to fascism, loyal to international bankers, who is doing his utmost to provoke a war with Iran, which, given Iran's membership of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (China, India, Russia, Pakistan...), could quickly turn into a global conflict and destroy the world economy because of Iran's control of the Strait of Hormuz, only two miles wide, through which 20% of the world's oil supplies pass.
In what light do the words of David Rockefeller in 1994 appear: "The only thing we need is an all-encompassing crisis, and people will welcome the new world order."
In their imagination, the new world order is a world of masters and slaves.
A world in which the rest of the human population serves a small group of financial aristocrats.
A world in which every newborn is implanted with a chip at birth in order to subject this being to total control.
And he causes all, small and great, rich and poor, free and bondmen, to receive a mark on their right hand or on their foreheads, that no one may buy or sell except he who has the mark, that is, the name of the beast, or the number of his name.
Here is wisdom: let him that hath understanding count the number of the beast.
For it is the number of a man, and his number is six hundred and sixty-six. "
The movie Argo: When it's at its worst, call Hollywood
In November 1979, a mob of protesting Islamist students occupied the U.S. Embassy in Tehran and took 52 diplomats hostage.
For their release, they demanded the extradition of ousted Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, who fled to the United States after the revolution, which had ruled his regime for decades.
For the American government, there was no positive way out of this situation - it could not afford to jettison the Shah, as it would have severely damaged the trust of its allies in other countries.
At the same time, it was unable to secure the release of the hostages in Iran, where the revolution led to the establishment of a theocratic regime.
It was a serious blow to the reputation of the United States, and the ensuing fiasco in the violent attempt to free the hostages only made matters worse.
The captured diplomats were finally released after 444 days, after negotiations mediated by the Algerian government.
The fate of the hostages provoked a wave of solidarity and anti-Iranian sentiment at home.
The Iran debacle contributed significantly to Jimmy Carter's defeat by Ronald Reagan in the 1980 presidential election.
The film Argo by the director and actor Ben Affleck describes an episode of this story, which gave the USA a small partial victory.
Immediately before the occupation of the embassy, six embassy staff managed to escape.
This ended after numerous complications at the residence of the Canadian ambassador.
The CIA, in collaboration with the Canadian authorities, managed to bring the refugees from Iran, helped by an extravagant story to disguise their true identities - they traveled with Canadian passports disguised as members of a film crew who allegedly visited locations in the country for a sci-fi film.
Combination of genres
The plan, devised by "exfiltration" expert Tony Mendez, also required Hollywood's cooperation.
In order for the camouflage to be credible, articles about this film project appeared in specialist magazines, press conferences were held, and the fictitious production company had a real office.
The details of the operation have long been kept secret, and the film is based on Tony Mendez's memoirs.
Affleck's film is a particular combination of several film genres.
On the one hand, it is a realistic political thriller, but at the same time also a so-called "caper movie," i.e. the story of a successful hussar play such as the film Ocean's Eleven.
As a result, the mood levels in the film alternate - on the one hand, the documentary scenes from Tehran (the title sequence shows iconic contemporary photographs, and there are also no great differences in the film version of the same situations).
On the other hand, there are the loose passages from Hollywood, which are ironic and slightly exaggerated.
And then there are the scenes from CIA headquarters and other institutions - men in suits at the meeting table, in the corridors, on the phone...
Ben Affleck has made a remarkable reboot of his career with this film.
A derided actor has become a respectable director, and as an actor he is no longer the target of ironic remarks.
Argo is his third feature film after the crime thriller No Child's Play (Gone Baby Gone, 2007) and the thriller Town Without Mercy (2010).
At the same time, it's Affleck's first film not set in the director's native Boston.
The feeling for the atmosphere of the place was one of the characteristics that set this director's previous films apart from the standard of Hollywood.
Affleck also proves his flair in Argo, where Tehran is "played" by Canada.
The best scenes in the film are set in the streets and show the reconstruction of events that really took place - the opening sequence of the storming of the embassy is very impressive in its clarity, yet still conveys the sense of confusion and unpredictability that occurs when the story moves somewhere.
Affleck and his team achieve a similar effect in fictional scenes (the wrong film crew at a bazaar in Tehran).
Too much action in too many places
The director also had to deal with the fact that the story actually does not offer many thrilling scenes in the cinematic sense.
But he works with very little, and sometimes helps with reality - which does not always seem so elegant (the scenes in which the impending crisis at Tehran airport is averted by a phone call in America, or even the chase on the runway, seem a little contrived).
The weakness of Argo is its over-dispersion, caused by the need to show too much action in too many places.
Alan Arkin and John Goodman are very charming in their roles as Hollywood employees, but their characters deserve more space, and they are far from alone in this film.
Affleck's film loses some traction as a result. It is a film that can be followed with a certain interest, while appreciating the design and the retro style reminiscent of a thriller from the 1970s.
However, it is difficult to arouse enthusiasm.
However, it is sufficient as a reminder of a living piece of history to this day, and as proof of how exaggerated the notions of the omnipotent and omniscient secret services are.
Guidelines for inflating balloons, for bananas and for the circus
The server www.bankovnipoplatky.com, which conducts an annual survey on the most absurd bank charges, has decided this year to organize the contest "The most absurd regulation or idea from the EU workshop."
"This idea was brought to us by the recent plan put forward by the EU to introduce a 40% quota for women in the management of large European companies," Patrik Nacher, who organises the survey, told the Právo newspaper.
Among the absurdities nominated is, for example, the ruling of the European Court of Justice on the standardisation of insurance rates for men and women.
Until then, women enjoyed an advantage in life insurance, because they objectively represent a lower risk for insurance companies.
"More incredible ideas from the EU workshop can be nominated by the end of this year.
The actual vote will take place by the end of February 2013, "Nacher said.
Among the controversial EU regulations are the mandatory addition of bioethanol to fuels, which is consequently harmful to nature, the ban on reliable mercury thermometers just because they contain a relatively small amount of this hazardous substance, and the directive on the size of chicken cages, which made eggs considerably more expensive this year.
The ban on the use of the term "butter spread" or the ban on the sale of conventional light bulbs has also attracted criticism in the past.
Bananas must be 14 cm long
The EU apparatus often decides under pressure from this or that lobby of trade and industry, whose demands in Brussels are usually represented by one or more member states (for example, the Czech Republic is currently trying to enforce the demands of Czech banks by threatening to veto them).
Lobby interests were also behind the requirement that bananas of the highest trading class in the EU must be at least 14 cm long and not exhibit an "anomaly in curvature."
The European Commission defended itself, arguing that it was merely harmonising inconsistent national standards that would hinder trade.
Standards on fruit and vegetables have already been softened by the EU in the face of opposition from some countries, with the suggestion that the existing directives would lead to food waste.
One candidate for victory in this poll may be last year's EU regulation, which requires balloons to be marked with a warning when sold that children under the age of eight may not inflate the balloon without adult supervision.
The EU cited an American study which found balloons were the leading cause of child suffocation deaths.
A similar restriction already applies to children up to 14 years of age when using fair flows.
There are also curious ideas at home
A directive concerning the European civil servants themselves is also relatively absurd - anyone in an official capacity in the EU is not allowed to use the term Macedonia because of the sensitivity of the issue for Greece and must instead say FYROM (Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia).
The server Bankovnípoplatky.com, in cooperation with the Association of Liberal Economists Laissez Faire, nominated the above-mentioned absurdities as well as the EU regulation on the level of food stocks in the territory of a member country.
The EU thus set the maximum amount of food stocks that could be on the territory of the Czech Republic on the day of our accession to the EU.
The Czech Republic then exceeded, for example, the specified volume for canned mushrooms, for which we were threatened with a large fine.
The organisers of the survey were also impressed by the idea that certain countries should receive money for not having a sea, or by the idea of giving money for applications for funding.
These ideas did not come from Brussels, of course, but from Prague.
"We are disadvantaged by the fact that we do not have a sea.
We will apply to the EU for reimbursement, "stated the then Minister of Agriculture Jaroslav Palas (ČSSD) in autumn 2004.
He argued that the cereal harvest was very high and that the state warehouses were overcrowded as a result of the so-called intervention purchases.
Since the Czech Republic has another route to seaports, the EU should pay us hundreds of millions of euros, according to Palas.
The European Commission finally came to the Czech Republic's aid by organising a tender for the purchase of cereals from countries that do not have access to the sea.
The Ministry of Regional Development, headed by Minister Pavel Němec (US-DEU), offered subsidies to municipalities for applications for subsidies. Specifically, the funds were to be used for the drafting of subsidy applications to Brussels.
EU: Bizarre regulations are the exception
Regulations easily become a target for criticism in the Member States, but according to some experts, the EU's efforts to regulate and thus also to ensure the effectiveness and development of the European Union as a whole deserve more recognition.
A more serious problem, according to these experts, is rather EU funding for projects that have absolutely nothing in common with the deepening of European integration, but which were forced upon them by individual member states in the budget negotiations.
Emotions are also aroused in this country by the fact that the Czech Republic, like other member states, has to fight in Brussels for the right to use specific designations of traditional products and does not always win this battle.
After a six-year battle with Germany and Austria, the Czech Republic was able to defend the name "Olomoucké tvarůžky," but the national rum (Tuzemský rum), the tradition of which dates back to the 19th century, had to be renamed "Tuzemák."
The term rum may only be used for products made from sugar cane distillate, not for products made from sugar beet.
The official list of products registered in the EU now includes Karlovy Vary rusks, carp from Pohořelice and Třeboň, as well as Saas hops in the company of world-famous cheeses such as feta and gorgonzola, Lübeck marzipan and Parma ham.
The Pardubice gingerbread or the Hořice rolls can boast an EU stamp.
"People want me to save the republic, but I'm just an amateur," Okamura says.
Senator, how do you come up with the idea of running for president?
I'm not interested in being a senator or president.
If everything in our country worked without problems, I would not be running anywhere.
But I can no longer see the Republic being plundered for 20 years, thieves roaming free, while people are being taxed and the retirement age raised.
I had no ambitions to be a politician.
But when I see something I don't like, I try to propose a solution to change it.
And since I am already over 40, and independent and non-partisan, I have no other way of influencing things than to run for the office of senator or president.
You made it to the Senate and then immediately made your way to the castle.
Doesn't that turn your back on your constituents?
I have said all along that I will take up the fight for the castle after the outcome of the Senate elections.
I later clarified this and said that I would run for president if I was elected senator.
But my goal is not the function. The function is an instrument with which I can realize my visions.
For this, I need as much influence and a mandate as possible.
The difficulty is not just that we, as a people, rant in the pub and in front of the telly, but that we put down anyone who wants to make a difference.
Then there are the media, which want to rob you of honor and confuse the freedom of speech with the freedom to lie.
It has been alleged, for example, that I bribed journalists or that I was an adviser to Jiří Paroubek.
Let's talk about your visions.
You took up the fight for the castle with the thesis of material and criminal liability of politicians and with retroactive declarations of assets over 20 million crowns.
You need to change the law to do that.
As President, you have no competence in this regard, and only the Senate as a whole can propose legislation.
How do you intend to solve this problem?
As an ordinary citizen, I have campaigned for the tourist guide to remain a free trade, and this has been achieved.
The problem is small-minded politics - when someone from the right or the left comes up with a good proposal, it is deliberately rejected, and that only stops the population.
As an independent, I have far greater potential to win support from all the parties represented in Parliament.
My advantage is that I can take from each party what is best for our country without pigeonholing and party dogma.
Do you see yourself as a person on the right or the left in politics?
From a Czech point of view, it seems to me that people tend to see me on the left.
For me, however, this right-left thinking is completely unimportant.
For me, it is important that we move forward.
I am not interested in whether someone belongs to the left or the right; I want to connect people.
I always publicly support any good solution, even if it comes from the KSČM or ODS, and I will also oppose bad ideas.
You don't like it when someone calls you a populist.
But are you not confirming this by what you have just said?
When you set up a business plan in a company, you also have an ideal goal and a vision.
And you want to get closer to that.
It may be called populism, but all the proposals I have talked about are already working in the world, or they have been discussed by important experts.
But without parliamentary support, you are left with nothing but slogans.
And that doesn't get you very far in politics in the long term.
Or do you think that, if you talk to people long enough, you will succeed, for example, in enforcing material and criminal liability?
I have no other option.
To convince politicians, journalists and the public and to try to get them on our side in order to achieve these objectives.
As President, it would be no problem for me to ask the leaders of the parliamentary parties live on television to enshrine in law material and criminal liability for politicians, civil servants, judges and prosecutors.
And those addressed would then have to say why they refuse to do so.
A strong figure who points out grievances can exert pressure on the political scene.
Take, for example, the direct election of the President, which was a result of public pressure.
I say clearly that I am an amateur; I am neither a genius nor an intellectual.
I try to find allies for my views and visions.
I have only just started politics and I am trying to get the support of the majority for my programme.
I always try to judge things for myself, and if it doesn't work out, I'll go back to the private sector in six years.
It sounds a little like Okamura should save the Czech Republic.
I'm not a saviour.
I know that I am not achieving anything on my own, which is why I have spoken to a number of well-known people about whether they would also like to run for the Senate.
I spoke to Radim Jančura, for example, but he refused because of overwork.
I also supported the investigative journalist Jana Lorencová, who uncovered fraud in the light fuel oil trade.
I started my candidacy on the premise that people are deeply dissatisfied, but now I am no longer sure.
Sixty percent of eligible voters did not go to the polls at all, and those who did mostly voted for establishment figures.
That leaves us with only two independents in the Senate.
People have chosen such a Senate composition that changes will be very difficult to enforce.
Nevertheless, I will fight for my visions, e.g. for the direct election of mayors and district captains.
Are you thinking about forming your own party?
I haven't thought about it because I don't have time to review every potential party member's past, and I don't have the money to do it.
I do not even have money for the presidential campaign; there is only CZK 20,000 in my transparent account.
You have no money?
You talk about declarations of assets, what would yours look like?
I estimate my personal wealth to be around CZK 60 million.
In Prague, I have a property worth 25 million, an apartment worth about 10 million, another one worth 8 million, an art collection worth about 10 million, an Aston Martin worth 3.5 million and a Škodu Superb worth about one million, and then I have a few million in my bank account.
By the way, the Aston Martin was a childhood dream - I always liked James Bond, the way he drove the car, was gallant to women and fought against evil at the same time.
You drive an Aston Martin, have a fortune of 60 million and have no money for your campaign?
You say you want to change the republic, but you don't want to invest your own money in it.
This is not very convincing.
I don't have $15 million for the campaign.
Should I be in debt?
I've already put $2.5 million into the campaign.
The fact that I don't have any sponsors shows that my program probably doesn't attract too much interest.
And I am under no obligation to fund the campaign from my own resources.
The cost of the campaign is basically covered by my salary as a senator.
But I could not live on the senator's salary alone; for example, I could not finance my son's English school, which costs 30,000 a month.
If I just wanted to make money, I wouldn't run for anything.
So do you continue to work as an entrepreneur in order to earn a living?
Didn't you say you would scale back these activities?
But that is not related to the level of pay.
As promised, I have partially scaled back my activities.
For example, my deputy will become managing director of the travel agency in the spring.
People want to see me as the Samaritan who saves the Republic.
But I also have to live on something.
What monthly income were you used to as an entrepreneur?
About 200,000 to 400,000, and that continues to be the case.
As President, however, I would cease all activities.

The MVRDV architects prove that the true adventures are not only in the mind - using the example of Spijkenisse and the recently built Bucherberg - 2 photos
"I find the building funny, it looks futuristic, and finally there is something interesting to see again," says Lisette Verhaig, a passer-by on the side of the road.
And Stefan Spermon, an IT technician at a large company nearby, says: "Yes, the house is beautiful."
But I wonder why we still need a library today.
All have internet, iPad and e-books.
No one goes to one of these old-style libraries voluntarily any more, right?
Spijkenisse, a sleeping town just outside Rotterdam that hardly needs to be visited, is a strange record holder.
The 80,000 inhabitants of the municipality have the lowest education rate in the whole of the Netherlands.
In order to counteract this foolish situation, it was decided a few years ago to contribute to general education and to recreate the seven fictitious bridges depicted on the euro notes as beautifully painted reinforced concrete miniatures.
The success of the educational offensive was limited.
And so the city fathers realized that there was only one way to master statistics: a library was needed!
Winy Maas from the Rotterdam architectural firm MVRDV, master of daredevil bar charts and producer of witty, often cynical buildings, took things with his usual composure and appeared at the competition hearing in 2003 with five books under his arm and a grin on his face.
And while the jury still looked around in bewilderment and shrugged its shoulders, the cheeky Maas piled his choicest souvenirs in size into a pyramid and ended his actionist-backed speech with the words: "Dear municipality!"
So here it is, my proposal for the Spijkenisse Book Mountain, the so-called Boekenberg!
Nine years later, the 30 million euro mountain is heaped up.
It is part of a revitalization project that also includes underground parking, a supermarket, a post office and a few adjacent residential and terraced houses with a total of 50 apartments.
At the beginning of November, the Bücherberg was awarded second prize "Best Library of NL 2012."
The project is also nominated for the Dutch National Wood Award 2012.
This adds a piece of contemporary architecture to the faceless small town cake, which until now had nothing more to offer than a postmodern pedestrian zone and a staggeringly ugly town hall, behind whose white facades one would be inclined to suspect a dairy factory.
Above all, Spijkenisse now has the first public cultural building in the history of its existence.
The Long Road to the Book
The first impression: a paradise of books under a cheese bell.
Although there is a lift that leads through the middle of the mountain massif, the true pleasures of space and reading are revealed when climbing the topography on foot.
The all-around glazed interior is bright and clear, the burnt brick floor and the elegant street lamps speak unmistakably the language of a public town square.
The urban ambience is perfect.
People are already on the lookout for park benches, dogs and football-playing boys and girls.
And books, books, books everywhere.
"Normally the bookshelves are along the facade, and in the middle is a large, dark room, which is usually uncomfortable and impersonal," says Winy Maas.
We have turned the classic room configuration upside down and turned the reading area from the inside out.
The interior of the Bücherberg is cleverly used: in the middle are offices, Internet library, chess club, environmental centre and building services centre.
A special joy are the black bookshelves, which are sometimes wall cladding, sometimes balustrade, sometimes staircase railings.
The look, feel and smell are foreign.
Even die-hard architects and civil engineers shake their heads at the unknown building material.
"We wanted to work with recycled materials here," explains Joop Trouborst, project manager at the municipality of Spijkenisse, at the request of the Standard.
And so one day we came across a suitable waste product from agriculture in a farm in Friesland.
For many years, a millimetre-thin plastic fleece has been used as a root layer in greenhouses and in fields in the Netherlands.
This is cheap and time-efficient.
The thin textile lasts one or two seasons, after which it is ripe for bulky waste.
For the library, the fleece was pressed - for the first time in these quantities - into sheets four centimetres thick.
Under heat and pressure, the so-called Landbouwplastic (KLP) changes colour to a dark, homogeneous, durable material that smells a bit like a new car and a bit like a sports shoe.
After 105 steps you reach the summit.
At the end of the almost 500-metre walk, you will be rewarded not only with a fantastic view of the city, but also with Dutch croquettes and potted ficus trees in the Literaturcafé.
They provide atmosphere, but above all the right humidity in the literary mountains.
Donations for the new soul
"You wouldn't believe it, but this house, despite the many glass surfaces, is a showcase project in terms of ecology," says Trouborst.
It is heated and cooled with geothermal energy.
Although the Bücherberg stands under a glass lintel, the sun shines only briefly into the interior, even on sunny days.
The wide glued wooden beams, which stand transversely to the glass façade, serve as shade and absorb most of the sun's radiation.
The indoor climate is very pleasant.
The rest is done by fully automatic blinds.
Stefan Spermon, the initial sceptic from the IT industry, has already ventured into the new library.
Lisette Verhaig was there, too.
And also the TCM teacher Cynthia Bogarde, who even calls the Boekenberg Spijkenissen's "long overdue soul."
The reason: At the opening a few weeks ago, every resident was invited to donate a book from his personal collection.
For the time being, this is intended to fill the optical gaps in the not yet fully stocked library - currently 70,000 pieces.
The concept has worked.
The shelves are filled to the brim.
"Nothing is worse than a half-empty library," says architect Winy Maas.
"I think, thanks to our invitation, every resident now has a certain relationship with this new house.
Everyone knows that his book is part of this building.
And if it's just for adornment.
In this way, MVRDV has succeeded in what is known in technical jargon as identity foundation.
Spijkenisse has written literary history.
However young and uneducated she may be.
This is finally a starting point for identity.
Szabo: "Germans must play a greater role"
Germany abstained in the vote on the admission of Palestine.
According to Stephen Szabo, an expert on US-European relations, Berlin is thus balancing on a narrow diplomatic line.
Deutsche Welle: At the beginning of the week, Germany initially signalled that it would vote against the Palestinians "request for observer status at the United Nations.
But then Berlin abstained.
Why?
Stephen Szabo: Germany does not support what the Israelis have done in Gaza.
Now, however, Germany must be careful, owing to its special relationship with Israel.
But at the same time, I don't think it supports the American position either.
Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence - but without being too critical of Israel.
During the uprising in Libya in March 2011, Germany also abstained from voting on the establishment of a no-fly zone.
This was eventually enforced by NATO.
Is it difficult for Germany to adopt a clear position on important international issues?
Yes, that's right.
This is because it is changing its foreign policy away from a policy that was, so to speak, managed by the United States, towards a German foreign policy.
To make matters worse, Europeans do not have a coherent and uniform policy.
So the Germans find themselves between the fronts.
They are expected to play a more independent role, but they are not used to that.
I think they are still playing their part, but they are on the way to a more "normal" foreign policy.
A foreign policy like that of France or Great Britain.
What does a "normal" foreign policy actually mean from a German perspective?
It shows a willingness to adopt positions on national interests that are independent of those of the USA or European partners.
I believe that German foreign policy is motivated by economic policy, in other words by exports and its relations with certain regions, such as Russia, China or the Middle East.
Germany's economic interests are to a certain extent different from those of the other major powers, and therefore Germany must protect its interests.
Have these economic interests influenced the position on the Middle East conflict and the UN vote?
On the one hand, Germany has large sales markets in the Middle East, particularly in the Gulf states.
Therefore, it must be careful not to alienate the public, but also the elites, in the Arab countries.
That definitely plays a part.
But I would not want to attach too much weight to this either, it is not a completely one-sided relationship.
But it definitely plays an important role in German considerations.
Did Germany damage its relations with the US by abstaining on important decisions, such as the vote on Palestine?
I believe that there is a great deal of understanding in Europe, and even in the United States, for the German position.
Therefore, I do not believe that this was as dramatic a rupture as the Libyan issue.
Perhaps this will even earn Germany some respect.
After all, it signals that as an international player it must be taken seriously and its interests must be taken into account.
Opinions differ in Europe on the Palestinian initiative.
The US, on the other hand, has been clear in its support for a veto.
Are there differences of opinion between the US and many European nations?
Because of American domestic politics, these differences have always existed.
I believe that the Obama administration secretly has quite a lot of understanding for the European position.
But, of course, because of the political situation here, the government cannot take this position publicly.
I believe that the actual differences of opinion are not as great as they always seem.
If you look at the relationship between Obama and Prime Minister Netanyahu, Obama is not all that enthusiastic about Netanyahu's policies.
Is it difficult for Germany to reconcile its close relations with Israel and the USA on the one hand, and the position of its most important partners in the EU on the other?
I think that's what makes it so difficult for the Germans.
It would, of course, be a little easier for the Germans if there were a coherent and uniform European policy, which is not the case at present.
So they cannot be part of a broader line and must instead push things from their own position.
That is what they are doing with the euro.
I believe that in the future Germany will play a leading role in pushing Europe towards a European position.
Of course, this is not easy for Germany, if only because of its relationship with Israel.
This has always been a sensitive issue.
But I believe that the Germans realise that they must play a more independent role.
Does Germany see itself as an important international player - does Germany even want to play a leading role?
Or is it still difficult for Germany to lead?
Germany is not used to it, it is still unpleasant, and, for obvious reasons, it is still finding it difficult to play a bigger role.
If we look, for example, at the euro crisis, every time Germany assumes a greater role, all kinds of anti-German feelings are unleashed.
That doesn't make it easy for the Germans.
This is actually the old problem: you don't want to be surrounded by hostile countries.
Seen in this light, Germany is in a much more difficult position than the US.
It has to be receptive to different neighbors and opinions and that is not easy.
Now the influence of the USA in European politics is steadily decreasing, but the EU is not filling this vacuum at the moment, so who else is there?
The Germans will simply have to play a bigger role.
Even if they don't like it, if they don't like it and if it makes them even more unpopular - c'est la vie!

"Brand protection" in China: When Puma and Armani suddenly become Chinese
Armani is a world-renowned brand, and so is Polo Ralph Lauren.
But what is Armani Polo?
This is an officially registered name in China, but it has nothing to do with the companies of origin.
Nevertheless, it is protected as long as the actual namesakes do not sue.
And even then, it is not clear whether they are right.
"It is becoming more and more difficult for foreigners to protect their trademarks in China," says Thomas Pattloch, a lawyer at the law firm Taylor Wessing who specialises in infringement of intellectual property rights in the Far East.
Every week, a new case lands on my desk.
Just a few additional letters are enough for the imitators to be able to apply for their trademarks.
So Gucci just becomes Lu-Gucci, instead of Prada you have Prada-Kny registered.
German companies are also legally copied in this way, such as the sporting goods manufacturer Puma.
Pattloch opens a folder with registrations of the Trademark Office in Beijing.
On September 14, 2010, a Chinese company registered the trademark Zegna DF Puma, an artistic name also used by fashion house Ermenegildo Zegna.
It is well known that the Chinese are world champions in copying and infringing intellectual property.
In the big cities, there are multi-storey department stores that almost exclusively sell counterfeit goods.
Pattloch's cases, however, are different: On behalf of his clients, he is taking action against the fact that Chinese companies are officially granted the right by the Trademark Office to use a designation that is already protected elsewhere.
The Chinese call this "Bang Mingpai," a passenger brand.
The word is based on "Bang Dakuan."
This refers to women fishing for rich men.
The Chinese authorities are not aware of any guilt
"It's damaging business, you have to fight it," Pattloch says.
"The brand is being watered down, the unique position is disappearing, the image damage is enormous."
The financial losses and legal costs of the affected industries run into the millions, especially for expensive flagship products.
According to the market research firm CLSA, China is the third largest market for luxury goods and the fastest growing, with a volume of 15 billion euros per year.
But deletions of dubious entries in the trademark register are difficult to achieve and cost money.
The process can drag on for up to nine years, with an uncertain outcome.
Pattloch reports on cases in which the court dismissed claims because, after the long period of time, the name objected to had become "market reality."
If the plaintiff is unlucky, he even has to pay the plagiarist money because he infringes his trademark in China, says Pattloch.
Sometimes the law of the jungle rules here.
Famous cases also involve graphic elements.
In 2009 Daimler lost a legal battle with the construction equipment manufacturer Sany, the company that recently took over the German concrete pump manufacturer Putzmeister.
The Chinese are therefore still allowed to use an emblem that resembles the Mercedes star.
Volvo buyer Geely originally used a blue and white logo reminiscent of BMW; the dispute was settled and Geely had to change it.
Fashion manufacturer Lacoste lost out in China to imitators from Hong Kong and Singapore, who let the famous crocodile look the other way.
The Chinese authorities are not aware of any culpability.
The Trademark Office CTMO in Beijing admits that there were bottlenecks there in 2010 due to insufficient staffing and room equipment.
In the past year, however, they have "returned to normal" from the "emergency situation in the workflow."
For example, the stock of unprocessed opposition proceedings has fallen by 22 percent.
Nearly 57,000 such cases have been closed, 75 percent more than the previous year.
However, there are still 81,500 appeals waiting to be dealt with in the office.
Tackling it costs a lot
As is so often the case in China, the figures are impressive.
Last year, the CTMO received more than 1.4 million applications for trademark protection, almost a third more than in 2010.
This is a record and means that China has topped the list of new applications worldwide for the tenth year in a row, the agency said.
This also applies to the inventory of all valid trademarks, a total of 5.5 million pieces.
In 2011, 1.8 billion yuan in fees were collected.
Simplified, this means that each registration costs an average of 1280 yuan or 160 euros.
It costs many times more to deal with this, as the case of the German family-owned company Freudenberg shows.
For more than seven years, the company has been fighting a Chinese plagiarist.
It is true that the Germans succeeded in unearthing its illegal manufacture of imitated motor vehicle parts.
However, the copycat still secured the Chinese rights to the Freudenberg brand.
Hanno Wentzler, CEO of Freudenberg Chemical Specialities in Munich, says that the company itself failed to do so because surnames could not be protected in Germany.
The Trademark Office CTMO rejected the opposition of the Munich-based company.
Freudenberg was proved right in the next two instances, but the litigant continues to fight to this day.
You have to be very careful.
The matter is now before the Supreme Court.
Wentzler is confident of bringing the matter to a good conclusion and praises the professionalism of the courts.
But he also says: 'The procedure is extremely time-consuming and costs us a lot of time, money and nerves.'
The internal costs could hardly be quantified, the company archives even had to peruse files that were one hundred years old in order to produce evidence.
Five years ago Freudenberg unsuccessfully offered the opposing party a "high six-figure sum of euro" to settle the case.
"That shows how much this is worth to us," says Wentzler.
The dangers in the Far East are even threatening to spill over into Europe.
That is when imitators secure unprotected trademarks there.
For example, a Chinese manufacturer wanted to apply for the Freudenberg designation for shoes and leather in Germany.
The group has long since abandoned this business area, but was nevertheless able to avert registration.
"You have to be very careful," Wentzler said.
Both he and lawyer Pattloch advise German companies to be very careful when doing business with China.
It is not enough to rely on international trademark rights; rather, foreigners should "apply for everything that is in any way worthy of protection in China," as Wentzler says.
Otherwise it can be much more expensive than registration.
In fact, if Freudenberg succumbed in the last act of its trademark drama, then one would probably have to pay royalties for one's own name to the other side, explains Wentzler.
Or we will be forced out of the market in the segment in question.
World AIDS Day: stomping, singing, helping
In Heidelberg, the Imbongi Choir rehearses - and in Swaziland, AIDS orphans rejoice.
The story of a connection that covers far more than 8,733 kilometres.
First there is the stomping: cowboy boots, basketball shoes, ladies pumps and men's slippers look for the beat on the parquet floor, find it quickly.
One-two-three-four.
Only then do the voices of the singers - alto, bass, tenor and soprano - slowly swell up, beguile and persecute each other.
And Fiete Hopf, the 29-year-old conductor, almost lifts it out of his cloth shoes when he brings them together with his supple, wild gestures.
It is Monday evening, in the music room of the Institute of Medical Psychology in Heidelberg, the Imbongi Choir is rehearsing a new song.
About fifty singers, ranging in age from 23 to 69, from human geneticists to house musicians, have come together.
"Om'Obani" is not a simple piece, each choir voice has a different text and this one in a very foreign language: Zulu, which is spoken by eleven million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and parts of Swaziland.
Helping people to help themselves
There are around 34 million people living with HIV worldwide, according to estimates by Unaids, the United Nations programme to combat AIDS.
23.5 million of them live in Southern Africa.
There are 245,000 AIDS orphans in Swaziland.
More than 40 percent of the population are now HIV positive.
The association Voices for Africa has found sponsors in Germany for 180 AIDS orphans in the village of Esitjeni.
Seventy of them attend secondary school.
For 15 or 20 euros a month you can take on a sponsorship.
It guarantees the child school fees, school uniform and a hot meal every day at the Gogo Center.
In Zulu, imbongi means storyteller or laureate.
No one in this room can speak the Bantu language fluently, but they can sing.
For almost ten years, the choir has been practicing songs in this foreign soft language and occasionally brings them back to where they originally came from: to the south of Africa.
Because 8,733 kilometres as the crow flies from Heidelberg, in the north-west of the Kingdom of Swaziland, there is the village of Esitjeni, which depends on the voice of the German choir.
Forty percent are infected
About 2000 people live there, some still in simple mud and straw huts, most of them children.
More than 300 of them no longer have parents because they succumbed to the HIV virus.
Esitjeni shows in small detail what the whole of Swaziland suffers from: the highest rate of HIV infection and the lowest life expectancy worldwide, according to Unicef.
Circumcision of the male foreskin, which has been shown to reduce the risk of infection by half, is hardly accepted by the population.
More than forty percent of people in Swaziland carry the immunodeficiency virus, and dying in their mid-thirties is not uncommon.
During a joint trip to Africa in the spring of 2005, the choir discovered the village, but above all, the Imbongis saw many children on the streets who lacked not only parental care, but simply everything: food, clothing, education.
Without a school leaving certificate, there is absolutely no chance in a poor country.
In the beginning it was still the private commitment of individuals to send a child to school for a few euros a year and to make it possible for him to have a hot meal a day.
But just one year later, the choir founded the association "Voices for Africa," which since then has taken an almost professional approach to the AIDS orphans in Esitjeni.
Facts on sexually transmitted infections
What are the main sexually transmitted diseases?
Bacterial STIs include syphilis, chlamydia and gonorrhoea.
Common viral STIs include HIV, human papillomavirus, genital herpes or hepatitis.
Felt lice and scabies belong to the parasitic STI.
Who are the main stakeholders?
Syphilis and trippers are most common in men who have sex with men.
The Robert Koch Institute assumes that at least four out of five syphilis cases reported in Germany are transmitted through sexual contact between men.
In heterosexual adults, chlamydia infections, trichomonads, candidosis (fungus), tripper and human papillomavirus are common sexually transmitted diseases.
The prevalence of HIV among heterosexual adults in this country is comparatively low - nevertheless, this group accounts for around 20 percent of new HIV infections.
Chlamydia infections are much more common among adolescents than in other populations.
According to European surveys, three quarters of all infections affect young people between 15 and 25 years of age.
Human papillomavirus is also common in adolescents in this country.
How has the number of infections developed?
Not all sexually transmitted diseases are notifiable.
According to the Robert Koch Institute, the number of syphilis infections more than doubled from 1,697 in 2001 to 3,698 in 2011.
The number of new HIV infections has been decreasing since 2007.
There were around 2,700 cases in 2011.
That's about a tenth less than the year before.
Which symptoms indicate a venereal disease?
Infectious diseases can cause ulcers in the genital area, discomfort with urination, discharge, lower abdominal pain, and blisters or warts.
Often, however, they do not cause pain or other symptoms and therefore go unnoticed.
How can you protect yourself?
Condoms can reduce the risk of infection, but they do not offer 100% protection.
In some cases, pathogens from sexually transmitted diseases can also be passed on through smear infections and close physical contact.
This is why experts recommend regular examinations, especially for frequently changing sex partners.
Diagnosed early, most STIs can be cured and long-term effects avoided.
Through sponsorships, donations and, last but not least, the fees that the choir earns throughout Germany, quite a few things come together.
"In total, we have already sent around 200,000 euros to Esitjeni," says Annette Lennartz, the chairwoman of the association.
In the village itself, Zodwa Dlamini, a confident and assertive woman, manages the funds from Germany.
She also takes care that the orphans are well housed, for example with one of the grandmothers.
The Gogos, as the old Zulu women are called, are the pillars of the village.
Some of them take in up to 14 orphans, give them a roof over their heads and ensure that the children arrive in their uniforms on time for school every day.
If you have no one left, you can go to Khanyisile, a single woman who is paid by the association as well as the two cooks who cook for more than 200 hungry children every day.
In addition, Voices for Africa has set up a sewing school, built two chicken houses and, together with the American health organisation PSI, organised for many in the village to have an HIV test.
This is not to be taken for granted, because as obvious as the disease is throughout the country, one prefers to keep quiet about it.
A king with 14 wives
"AIDS is an absolute taboo," says Annette Lennartz, "because it has to do with sexuality."
Odd really, in a country where the king officially has 14 wives.
The last absolute monarch of sub-Saharan Africa, King Mswati III, is known for his excessive lifestyle.
Polygamy instead of democracy.
Among other things, it is also due to this state-sanctioned way of life that the HIV virus has spread so rapidly in recent decades.
But also to the many migrant workers who carry the virus across the country.
Free condoms are available at every corner, says Annette Lennartz, "but they are rarely used.
The culture is different - flesh to flesh. "
In order to promote cultural exchange, the Imbongi Choir travels together every two or three years through southern Africa and sings songs full of melancholy, fighting spirit, confidence and black self-confidence, which many on the southern tip of the black continent still know from the time of apartheid.
A bus full of white people singing songs in a black language - so much recognition not only brings mood and joy, but has also brought tears to some grim border guards.
The journey always leads to Esitjeni, where the singers visit their godchildren.
Although the small village is hardly to be found on maps, it is more than known in the valley of the Ezulweni River.
"Go to Esitjeni, there is the light," the people there say.
And when you return the 8733 kilometres as the crow flies to Heidelberg, to the stomping singers in the rehearsal room on Bergheimer Straße, you can see it shining.
Messenger: NASA discovers ice on Mercury
The Messenger probe has found evidence that there is ice on the planet Mercury.
The ice sheet is thought to be up to 20 metres thick.
The US space agency NASA has confirmed the existence of ice on the planet Mercury.
Although it is closest to the sun, there is also frozen water there, according to three studies published Thursday in the journal Science.
The Messenger probe has found evidence that there is an ice sheet in the permanently shadowy region of the planet.
This should be at least 30 centimetres thick and possibly even up to 20 metres thick.
The water is thought to have come from comets or possibly asteroids that have impacted Mercury.
But no one is linking the discovery of ice to the existence of life on the planet, said Sean Solomon, the probe's chief scientist.
The temperature on Mercury can reach up to 426 degrees Celsius.
However, the findings could help to clarify how water and other building blocks of life arrived in other parts of the solar system.
Unnoticed by Earth's inhabitants, probes, telescopes, and small robots like Phoenix are exploring the depths of space.
From time to time, they send images to Earth: small peepholes into infinite expanses.
The image comes from a camera developed by German researchers from the Max Planck Institute.
The eight planets of our solar system, plus the dwarf planet Ceres.
Like Pluto, which orbits the sun behind Neptune, Ceres is not a "planet," according to the International Astronomical Union's new definition in 2006.
This section of an infrared image taken by the Spitzer telescope shows a "family portrait" of innumerable generations of stars: The oldest stars can be recognized as blue dots, while the pink "newborns" in the Star Circle Hall are harder to identify.
This star-forming region - unromantically called W5 by scientists - was discovered by the Spitzer telescope in the constellation Cassiopeia, at a distance of 6,500 light years.
This dazzling glow of a dying star was captured by Nasa's Spitzer telescope.
The donut-shaped ring consists of material thrown out by the star during the dying process.
In the giant Trifid Nebula, 5,400 light years from Earth, new stars are formed from gas and dust.
Nasa's Spitzer telescope snapped this photo of the galactic birthplace.
The Pleiades Cluster, also called "The Seven Sisters," can be seen with the naked eye at night.
With the telescope, however, the colors come into their own better.
In this infrared photo, the Helix Nebula looks towards the viewer like a red age.
It is located 700 light years away in the Aquarius constellation.
Its resemblance to an earthly continent earned this nebula the title North America.
A combination of normal and infrared photo ensures the spectacular color scheme.
This baby star could only be imaged in its full beauty by the infrared detectors of the Spitzer telescope.
Saturn and its rings: How they formed is one of the great mysteries of astronomy.
They may be the remains of a Saturn moon that disappeared without a trace 4.5 billion years ago.
One of the Largest and Sharpest Images of the Hubble Telescope: The Whirlpool Galaxy
Depending on the color, images of spiral galaxies become true works of art.
The image published by the European Southern Observatory shows the Trifid Nebula in the constellation of Sagittarius, several thousand light years away.
The name Trifid comes from the Latin word trifidus (tripartite, tripartite), because dark dust stripes tripartite the glowing heart of the birthplace of stars.
In the constellation of the Serpent Bearer, astronomers have photographed the harbingers of a cosmic carbuncle: 400 million light years from Earth, the cores of two merging galaxies race towards each other and will inevitably collide with each other.
This star birth was recorded by the Hubble telescope in the spiral galaxy M83.
If you don't like technical abbreviations, call them by their nickname Southern Wheel of Fire.
The Hubble Space Telescope photo shows a section of the Iris Nebula in the constellation of Kepheus.
The nebula, located 1400 light years away, consists of dust particles that are ten to a hundred times smaller than ordinary house dust.
This image was assembled from optical and X-ray images taken by various telescopes.
It shows a ring of black holes 430 million light years from Earth.
This group of galaxies, called Arp 273, was captured by the Hubble Space Telescope for Nasa.
Scientists call the larger spiral galaxy UGC 1810.
This stellar nebula contains the brightest group of young stars in our Milky Way.
The Starcradle is always producing new youngsters.
Also this star-cloud, connected with the rosette-nebula, constantly gives birth to new baby-stars - 5000 light-years away from the earth.
In this bright galaxy with a small black hole, there is no dust yet, only gas.
Researchers suspect that it only formed shortly after the Big Bang, when hydrogen was predominantly found in the universe.
Our insights into space: The most important telescopes
The telescope is said to have been invented by Hans Lipperhey in 1608 - before Galileo Galilei used it for star observation a year later.
Since then, the mirrors of the optical telescopes have been getting bigger - and the insights they provide deeper and deeper.
For 30 years, from 1947 to 1975, the Hale telescope at the Palomar Observatory near San Diego was the largest telescope in the world.
The mirror, here in the picture, had an average of five meters.
The Large Binocular Telescope is located in Arizona, USA.
It allows views into space via two mirrors, each with a diameter of 8.4 metres.
The inner workings of the Gran Telescopio Canaria on the Canary Island of La Palma are huge - the mirror alone has a diameter of 10.4 metres.
The mirror of the Southern African Large Telescope in South Africa is segmented - to save costs.
Nevertheless, it reaches a diameter of about eleven meters.
The disadvantage of the favourable design: The telescope is fixed in its height angle - and thus limited in its mobility.
The Hobby Eberly telescope in Texas is also fixed in the elevation angle.
Its special feature: the high light collecting power.
In spite of its comparatively small mirror diameter, this is close to that of the world's largest mirror telescopes.
With the help of a radio telescope in Arecibo (Puerto Rico), researchers listen for extraterrestrial signals in space.
The radio telescope has a diameter of 305 metres.
In the "Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence" (SETI), every computer owner can help by providing computing power.
View of the European Observatory (ESO) in the Chilean Andes.
Here stands the Very Large Telescope - which lives up to its name.
With its four mirrors, the telescope can also illuminate the middle infrared spectrum.
The European Extremely Large Telescope is also planned at the ESO observatory in Chile.
Its main mirror is to comprise a whopping 42 metres - and be composed of almost 1000 mirror elements.
But images are not expected until 2018 at the earliest.
Until 2007, the two Keck telescopes on Hawaii's Mauna Kea volcano were considered the largest in the world.
They offer two mirrors with an average of ten metres each.
The Keck telescopes are part of the Mauna Kea Observatory, which besides them also looks into the sky with the Subaru telescope and the IRTTF.
A huge new telescope is also to be built on Mauna Kea - with a mirror average of thirty metres.
Here you can see it on an illustration.
The most important impressions from space, however, are provided by the Hubble Space Telescope.
Since April 24, 1990, it has been supplying images of distant worlds.
Since March 2009, the Kepler space telescope has been searching for extrasolar planets - primarily those that are habitable.
On February 2, 2011, Nasa announced that 1,235 planet candidates have been identified since the start of the mission.
The image documents the final launch preparations at the Kepler space telescope.
The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will not be launched into space until 2018 at the earliest, aboard an Ariane5 rocket.
The primary mirror of the space infrared telescope has a diameter of 6.5 meters.
One of the tasks of the telescope is to search for light from the first stars and galaxies after the Big Bang.
Scientists assume that ice also exists at Mercury's south pole.
However, there is no reliable data for this, as the Messenger orbits much closer to the north pole of the planet.
Radar measurements have indicated for decades that there is ice on Mercury.
Launched in 2004, the Messenger probe - the first to orbit Mercury - now gives scientists certainty.
Drink butter every day - and live to 168
In southern Azerbaijan, many people reach a biblically old age.
There is even a museum of longevity.
A search for clues in a country where 97-year-olds are still comparatively young.
In southern Azerbaijan, many people reach a biblically old age.
There is even a museum of longevity.
A search for clues in a country where 97-year-olds are still comparatively young.
The ride through the Talysch Mountains is wildly romantic.
The minibus rumbles along the winding road, past densely wooded hills, torrential rivers and simple farmhouses.
Everything is green and juicy, you might think you were in the Black Forest.
But this is the deepest south of Azerbaijan, the border with Iran is only a few kilometres away.
Here lives the Caucasian ethnic group of the Talysh, of which not much is known, except that it speaks Persian and Azeri perfectly and is very durable.
The final stop is Lerik.
The small town shows off its bulky Soviet-era architecture, which does not want to fit into the picturesque mountain landscape.
Tourists from Europe hardly come here, the journey from Azerbaijan's capital Baku is too arduous.
The 323 kilometres take eight hours because the road is only one lane.
The fabulous wealth that the country owes to its oil in the Caspian Sea has not yet arrived here in the province.
But Pilata Fatulayeva, 48, is convinced that Lerik has what it takes to be a tourist attraction.
"Baku became famous in May with the Eurovision Song Festival - and next year we have here a festival of the oldest people in the world," Fatulayeva says.
She is the director of the Museum of Longevity, probably the only one in the world.
Here the Vita of about eight dozen Talysh from the area, older than 100, is documented. Fatulayeva points to a black-and-white photo.
This is my grandfather, he was 120 years old.
Begot another child at the age of 136
But the controversial star of the museum is the shepherd Şirali Mueslümov, who is said to be 168 years old.
However, there is no birth certificate.
And with the oldest documented human being at 122 years old, Mueslümov's age seems extremely dubious.
"He was born here in the region in 1805 and died in 1973," Fatulayeva explains.
The man had been married three times and had 23 children, and at the age of 136 he is said to have fathered another daughter.
So, given his age, has he miscalculated by a few decades?
But Rembrandt Scholz, a senior researcher at the Max Planck Institute in Rostock, has also heard about the elderly in Central Asia.
"There are also remarkably many very old people in some areas of China, in Japan or in the Hunza Valley in Pakistan," says Scholz, "and there are also extremely many very old men living in Sardinia."
Due to a lack of documentation, however, no scientific proof of age had to be kept, especially as there were no registers of civil status.
Melted butter every day
The fact is, however, that the people of the region around Lerik strikingly often reach a biblical age.
There are currently 20 people older than 100 years of age.
So why do so many elderly people live here in the South?
The Azeri travel guide Farid Mugimzadeh explains this with the special genes of the Talysh people.
Museum director Fatulayeva, on the other hand, believes it's down to diet.
But the fact that the calorie-rich diet of the Talysh people, who love meat, bread and especially dairy products and many of whom drink a glass of melted butter every day, is supposed to be so healthy does not seem very plausible from a nutritional point of view.
Or is it the original way of life that keeps people young? Rubaba Mirzayeva lives in Cengemiran, a tiny settlement not far from the town of Lerik.
At 97 years of age, she is still comparatively young for these latitudes.
Mirzayeva, who claims to have 143 descendants, lives in a simple wooden house typical of the entire Caucasus region.
She sits on the floor with a butter barrel that she tirelessly rolls back and forth.
Eight people live here under one roof, including one of Mirzayeva's sons and a daughter, both of whom have long been grandparents.
Two toddlers also jump around.
In the kitchen, tea is prepared for the guests, served in the typical belly-shaped Armadu glasses.
Mirzayeva's white teeth are perfectly aligned, and beneath her headscarf she hides long dark blonde braids that her son proudly reveals to us.
I always washed my hair with milk, so it never ran out and kept its colour.
"I never used shampoo," Mirzayeva says.
Monthly pension is enough to live on
She always ate only what came from her own farm, tomatoes, potatoes, peas.
In my entire life, I have not once bought groceries in the supermarket.
Then she talks about her husband, who was in the army.
It was at its worst in the aftermath of the Second World War.
But things improved when "beloved father" Heydar Aliyev took the helm.
The propaganda sounds strange coming from the mouth of an old woman.
But the cult of the nation's father figure, who ruled his country like a dictator, knows no bounds in Azerbaijan.
He was in power until 2003, when his son Ilham took over.
After all, there is no hardship among Azerbaijan's elders.
230 manats (about the same amount in euros), Mirzayeva receives monthly as a pension, which is a good amount to live on by local standards.
And maybe Mirzayeva's long-greying son is right: "The elderly are held in high esteem in our culture."
They live in the midst of an extended family, are loved, cared for and happy.
If that's not a reason to stay alive as long as possible
The word "human right" is missing from the Constitution
The revolution has returned to Cairo.
Rival rallies in Cairo reveal the country's deep divisions.
The future constitution, based on Sharia law, is hotly contested.
The Egyptian president was not sparing with pathos.
We have to make the transition.
"And it is my responsibility, before the people and before God, that he succeeds," he said on state television.
His speech was addressed to the whole people, but most of all to the Christian Copts, the liberals, enlightened Muslims and secularists.
Because all of them, so far hopelessly divided in a confused opposition, are afraid.
Fear of a theocracy on the Nile at the mercy of the powerful Muslim Brotherhood.
Almost apologetically, Mohammed Morsi said he had temporarily curtailed the powers of the constitutional court and expanded its powers "to save the revolution."
But what the 61-year-old engineer, who holds a doctorate from the American University of Southern California, really wants to save is something the Egyptians are not quite clear about.
Should the judiciary be disempowered?
Indeed, some of the 234 articles pushed through by the Islamist-dominated 100-member Constituent Assembly in a 15-hour late-night parade are worrying.
As in previous constitutions, the draft states that jurisdiction is based on the "principles of Islamic law."
But what does "principles" mean?
That was and is a matter of interpretation, and it is to be feared that the Islamists will use the vague wording and the associated legal leeway for a stricter interpretation of Sharia law.
This is at least suggested by a newly added article: Al-Ashar University, the country's most important Islamic institution, must be consulted on all matters relating to Sharia law, with great resonance throughout Sunni Islam.
It does not have to, but it may mean that the clergy oversees the legislation, which would de facto incapacitate the judiciary.
Much of the draft Constitution is open to interpretation
Another problem is that civilian military justice should continue to be maintained.
These courts served to suppress opposition during Mubarak's rule.
After the fall of the dictator, up to 11,000 civilians were imprisoned in military custody.
The state should also, it says in the draft, "protect the true nature of the Egyptian family and promote its morals and values."
This is so vaguely formulated in legal terms that state institutions could even control the content of cinematography and literature with the help of this article.
In plain language, this means nothing other than censorship.
Incidentally, no article explicitly states equality between men and women.
For this, another prohibits insulting or slandering the Prophet Mohammed and his messengers.
But what constitutes an insult and how it should be punished remains unclear.
Equally dubious is the formulation that "insulting people" is forbidden.
Is a caricature of the President enough, or a joke at the expense of a legal scholar?
It is a matter of interpretation, as is so much of the draft submitted to Morsi for his signature, which he says will be presented to Egyptians for a referendum "very soon."
"The revolution has returned"
The opposition has been forming for weeks against the superiority of the Islamists.
Tens of thousands gathered in unaccustomed unity in Cairo's Tahrir Square on Friday night, vowing to overthrow the charter before it can enter into force.
"The revolution has returned and we will win," said Hamdin Sabbahi, a third-place finisher in the presidential election.
Nobel Peace Prize laureate and former head of the International Atomic Energy Agency Mohamed ElBaradei said the draft constitution belongs "in the garbage heap of history."
Via Twitter, he accused Morsi's supporters of waging a "coup against democracy."
"If he calls the referendum, we will go to his palace and topple him," said opposition activist Yasser Said.
"We are not tired yet, the blood of our brothers has not been atoned for," Egyptian media quoted opposition politician Khaled Ali as saying.
And several judges said they would not oversee the referendum, rendering it invalid.
"The Koran is our constitution"
The well-organized Muslim Brotherhood, for its part, blew for a counter-demonstration, but as a precaution not in Tahrir Square, but after a mass prayer on the other bank of the Nile in front of Cairo University.
Many veiled women and followers of the Salafists participated and shouted, "The people demand the application of God's law."
They demanded of Morsi: "Clean the country!" and asserted: "The Koran is our constitution."
A struggle for sovereignty over the symbolic Tahrir Square, where it all began, would have provoked a civil war-like situation.
Clearly, Morsi's supporters did not want to risk that.
The Muslim Brotherhood said both opponents of the draft constitution and supporters had spoken out loud and clear.
Now is the time to let the people decide at the ballot box in which direction the country should go.
A majority for the Islamists "draft is considered safe.
"The word human rights does not even appear"
Hafez Abu Saeda is angry about this forced constitutional process, which should have gone on until February and involved all social forces.
The 48-year-old human rights lawyer and chairman of the Egyptian Organization for Human Rights (EOHR) defended the Muslim Brotherhood when they were in prison or on trial under Mubarak.
Not because he shares their worldview, but because human rights are indivisible to him.
For this he was beaten, convicted and imprisoned.
"And now the word human rights is not even in the new constitution," he complains in an interview with "Welt am Sonntag."
Morsi's extension of power to all three powers in the state made the lawyer resign.
These measures are blatant violations of the rules of democracy and will lead Egypt into a new dictatorship.
"Instead of strengthening civil society, the president is de facto suspending it," Saeda laments.
But democracy cannot function without civil society organisations.
Saeda feels abandoned, even by the international community, which views the ideological struggle along the Nile with a mixture of curiosity and tension.
That could take its revenge.
A protester in Tahrir Square warns: "You're giving birth to a monster you can no longer control."
Rakfisk from Norway: Is this the world's most foul-smelling fish?
Norway's five million inhabitants enjoy one of the highest living standards - not only in Europe, but around the world.
Could the country's secret to success have something to do with the local appetite for pretty foul-smelling fish?
Take a selection of overripe cheeses.
Place them in the middle of a pile of dirty, damp sportswear.
And leave them there for a week.
Just imagine the nose-numbing smell of Rakfisk, one of Norway's great delicacies.
I am in the small town of Fagernes, about three hours from Oslo.
There's snow, spectacular landscapes - and that persistent smell in the air that just doesn't want to go away.
Rakfisk is trout sprinkled with salt, which - depending on how smelly you like your fish - is fermented in water for up to a year.
When darkness falls over Norway and the weather gets colder, Norwegians flock to a festival here in Fagernes dedicated to this, well, really captivating specialty.
"You eat it raw and then rinse it down with a glass of aquavit," says Havard Halvarsen, who actually works in the local fire station but is also the so-called "Rakfisk general" who organises the festival.
Around us, people eat small cubes of fish and consume large quantities of alcohol.
"Some people like the aquavit more than the rocket," says Havard.
The spirit can displace the smell.
I'm tasting some morsels.
If you avoid bringing the Rakfisk close to your nose, it's not bad - like sushi, which has had quite a long bus ride.
Rakfisk is the product of a very different, much poorer Norwegian era, when there were no refrigeration facilities and fish were soaked in airtight saltwater barrels in autumn.
In the depths of winter it was then taken out after a long fermentation and consumed - no doubt with the help of alcohol muted senses.
Only a generation ago, thousands of Norwegians were forced to leave their country in search of work, emigrating mainly to the US.
Today, the population is growing rapidly - more than 13% are immigrants, attracted by a thriving labor market, high wages, and comprehensive health care.
Even from Sweden, the old rival that not so long ago was far richer than Norway, immigrants are pouring in.
Rakfisk is seen as something important - an essential, if austere, part of Norway's history.
It is one of the more expensive dishes you can buy here.
But actually everything here is expensive - a small glass of beer or a sandwich costs 10 Euros.
Norway doesn't often make it into the world's press, and most people don't seem to mind.
People here still hate to mention Anders Breivik - the racist far-right extremist who shot dead 77 men, women and children last year.
Instead, it refers only to the "July 22 incident."
Norwegians have a hard time accepting that someone in their peace-loving country is capable of such brutal murders.
Since the early 1970s, the growth of one of the world's largest oil and gas industries has been largely responsible for Norway's current wealth.
"But oil is not the only reason we're doing so well," says Anna, our waitress, handing out round trays of ripe rakfisk, her long blonde hair and piercing blue eyes embodying the Nordic ideal.
We are, as they say, a prudent people.
Her English, like most people here, is impeccable.
We're not very ostentatious, we don't like bragging.
Norway has been very careful with its oil wealth - much of the industry's profits are invested in a special fund for the benefit of future generations.
In the years leading up to the Great Depression, when everyone was throwing money around that they didn't have, Norway kept its wallet tightly locked.
"As long as we can ski in the winter and go hiking in the summer, we're happy," says Anna.
"And, of course, eating rakfisk," she adds with a light-hearted laugh.
I stand in the snow and line up for another dish - I've had enough of Rakfisk.
Such a moose burger is definitely something else. I like the juicy meat.
But in the evening, the smelly fish is back on the menu.
The hotel I'm staying at is one of several venues that are organizing a rakfisk dinner where guests can vote for the best - or perhaps the most aromatic - fish.
There's a live TV feed to a bow-tie-clad showmaster surrounded by plates of rocket salmon.
The spectacle is similar to the Eurovision Song Contest.
"What score do you get up there in the mountains for the best fish, Thor-Juergen?"
"Here are our points, Havard."
They clap and laugh.
A man falls from his chair, possibly overwhelmed by the aquavit.
But perhaps it is the austere haze of the whole fish after all.
Mexico's Enrique Pena Nieto faces tough start
As Mexico's incoming president Enrique Pena Nieto prepares to take office, the BBC's Will Grant analyses the challenges ahead and the mixed feelings of his people.
Traffic is particularly bad in Mexico City at the moment.
Even on better days, this is an ever-congested city, but on Monday a ring of steel was erected, closing off several major transport routes into the capital and causing chaos on the streets.
The aim, however, was not to disrupt commuters on their way to work, but to prevent demonstrators from reaching Parliament.
On Saturday, Mexico's new president, Enrique Pena Nieto, will receive the presidential bandage and take over the nation's leadership.
He faces a complex task.
Mexico has performed well economically under Felipe Calderon's outgoing administration, but the country is in the grip of a drug war that has already claimed 60,000 lives in the past six years.
"My government is strongly committed to reducing violence," Pena Nieto told US President Barack Obama in the Oval Office earlier this week.
I will propose a new security strategy to help us achieve this goal.
Before joining the US president, Pena Nieto served as governor of his home state of Mexico.
Opinions about the new head of state are divided in this densely populated, sprawling part of the country that surrounds the capital.

In the remote small town of Valle del Bravo, for example, people like to remember him.
Residents of the resort attribute it to the development of tourism and the development of infrastructure.
To reach the city, you can drive on one of the highways that Pena Nieto had built, which are a great improvement on the brittle, bumpy roads that once existed here.
Plaques bearing his name also hang outside a modern sports centre and an impressive interactive climate change museum.
"We expect him to bring real and lasting change," said his friend and political ally Gabriel Olvera Hernandez, who works as a congressman for Pena Nieto's party, the PRI.
In particular, in terms of security and the economy, we hope for the interesting and real change that our country so desperately needs.
After 81 years in power, the PRI was replaced by Vicente Fox in 2000.
Congressman Olvera admits the party has high expectations of Enrique Pena Nieto after 12 years outside the presidential palace in Los Pinos.
He rejects the opposition's accusations that the new president lacks substance.
He is a very direct man, very committed and has big plans for the country.
He is an outstanding statesman, but above all he is someone who can listen.
But on the other side of the state, not many people share that view of their former governor.
In Nezahualcoyotl, also known as Ciudad Neza, the contrast with the cobbled streets of Valle del Bravo could not be greater.
The place is hidden under highway overpasses and represents in many ways a suburb of Mexico City itself.
And the problems in the community are of a decidedly urban nature.
Earlier this year, the military was called in to fight drug gangs operating in the neighbourhoods, and violence against women is a particularly acute problem.
On a patch of fallow land near a large landfill site, the bodies of dozens of murdered women have been left behind in the last two years alone.
During Governor Pena Nieto's tenure, more than 1,000 women were murdered in the state of Mexico - a statistic that surpasses even that of the city of Ciudad Juarez, which is notorious for its violence and the murders of innocent women.
Pena Nieto's critics say that he did not at least adequately address the problem of misogyny during his tenure.
But at worst, his government has turned a blind eye to the problem.
In a concrete building typical of the run-down neighborhood, Irinea Buendia fights back tears as she shows me photos of her late daughter Mariana Luna.
According to the official version of events, Mariana committed suicide in 2010.
But her family believe she was murdered by her partner.
"When I arrived at her home, it seemed as if her body had been washed," recalls Senora Buendia.
There were signs that she had been beaten, and the corpse freeze had already set in.
As her mother tells her story, a picture of Mariana looks down on us from the wall, next to a cross bearing a single word: justice.
But that, the family says, is exactly what they have been denied until now.
The authorities have treated me as if I were a talker, a troublemaker, a whiner.
They just want you to accept their verdict and shut up.
"But that's not possible when there have been so many flaws and omissions," she says.
When President Pena Nieto receives the presidential bandage on Saturday, he will also take on a great responsibility.
Tens of thousands of Mexican families have been affected by violent crime over the past six years, and the new president has promised to pay particular attention to the problem during his term in office.
"I hope as president he's the same as he was as governor," said Olvera, a PRI congressman in Valle del Bravo.
But that is precisely what the families of the victims in Ciudad Neza fear most.
Prosecutors allege Bradley Manning didn't complain about mistreatment
Prosecutors contradict Bradley Manning's allegations that he was mistreated in prison
The hearing will focus on Manning's time at the military prison in Quantico, Virginia
The defence is seeking to have the charges dismissed on the grounds that they were too harsh
US Army Private Is Accused of Stealing Thousands of Confidential Documents
Prosecutors on Friday sought to establish that Army Private Bradley Manning - charged with the largest leak of classified information in U.S. history - missed several opportunities to complain about the mistreatment he allegedly suffered in military custody.
During cross-examination of Manning during a pretrial hearing in Ft. Meade, Maryland, Maj. Ashden Fein said that records of weekly visits made by prison officials during Manning's nine-month incarceration in Quantico, Virginia, showed no complaints about his treatment.
A day before the cross-examination, which was held following a defense motion to dismiss the charges - Manning had already been sufficiently punished by the harsh time in prison - Manning had testified that he had contemplated suicide in prison.
The US Army intelligence analyst, who was arrested in June 2010, is accused of stealing thousands of confidential documents while serving in Iraq.
The material was then published on the Internet by WikiLeaks.
WikiLeaks has never confirmed Manning as the source of the information.
At Friday's hearing, Fein and Manning went through forms that officials had filled out after meeting Manning during his detention at the Quantico military prison, where he had served time under enhanced detention conditions from July 2010 to April 2011.
The officials asked Manning questions and wrote down his answers.
When Fein asked him about the forms on Friday, Manning admitted that he had rated the treatment by his guards as "excellent" and the treatment by the facility overall as "very professional."
The forms, Fein said, contained no complaints of mistreatment, though officials had questioned Manning directly about his treatment.
Manning responded that he had expressed his concerns orally and that officials had discussed them with him and indicated they would be addressed, but that they had not been recorded.
"They wrote down 'no problems' (after discussing the concerns), and that didn't necessarily mean I didn't say anything at all," Manning said.
The judge, Colonel Denise Lind, also asked Manning why he did not complain about his treatment when he met with a committee in January 2011 to investigate the suicidal thoughts he mentioned on a form a few months earlier.
Manning responded that his intention during that meeting was to have his observation status downgraded to "injury prevention."
The military said it had assigned him this restrictive status - one level below suicide risk - for his own protection and that of others.
"I wanted to convince staff that I was doing well and get rid of the observation status for injury prevention (...) in order to achieve what I believe is a better quality of life," Manning said.
Manning testified Thursday about his arrest and transfer to Kuwait, where he was held for nearly two months before being transferred to the prison at Quantico Naval Base in Virginia in July 2010.
He said he had considered suicide in Kuwait and had once fallen unconscious due to the heat.
Not being allowed to know what was happening to him or to the outside world was distressing.
"My world shrank to Camp Arafjon, to this cage," Manning said Thursday.
I thought I was going to die in that cage.
When he was transferred to Quantico, Manning spent most of his days in a small cell - at least 21 hours and often more than 23 hours - with no company.
All he was allowed was a mattress, a blanket, flip-flops, clothes and his glasses.
Manning said he tried to keep moving because it was forbidden to sleep or even lie down during the day.
He had always had to sleep with light that penetrated his cell from the outside.
When he turned around at night and guards could no longer see his face, he was woken up to turn back.
In January 2011, Manning's lawyer formally objected to Manning's treatment.
Manning was transferred to the military prison at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, in April 2011.
On Friday, the judge also questioned Manning about an allegation he made in his testimony on Thursday - that he slept one night naked in his Quantico cell and stood naked in front of guards and other prisoners at a morning count.
Manning had testified that he never had the opportunity to wrap himself in his blanket during that count.
Under questioning on Friday, Manning said he had concluded from an order from his guard that he should drop the blanket he could have covered himself with, but he acknowledged that no one had asked him to do so.
On Thursday, Manning testified that he was forced to sleep naked the previous night and had previously tried to show an officer that he posed no danger to himself.
Manning allegedly told the officer he could have used the waistband of his underpants or flip-flops to injure himself, but did not.
That night, Manning testified, his underpants, flip-flops and glasses were removed from his cell.
His lawyers hope the judge will at least take into account his prison experience and drastically reduce his sentence if he is convicted at his court martial, which is scheduled for early next year.
The defense has said Manning will plead guilty to lesser offenses, while other charges deemed too extreme will be challenged.
The hearing is set for this weekend and prosecutors are expected to justify the conditions of his detention.
The Pentagon stands by its position that Manning was held under the rules that apply to all detainees held under the highest security at Quantico.
The charges against Manning include aiding and abetting the enemy, unlawful publication of intelligence information on the Internet, transmission of national defense information, and theft of public property or documents.
If found guilty on all counts, he faces life in prison.
My Mexican-American identity crisis.
Many people are forced to leave Mexico due to the lack of opportunities
Mexicans tend to blame immigrants - they remind them of hard times, he says
Navarrette says Mexican Americans are caught between two worlds
On a recent trip to Mexico City, I had just crossed the hall and had arrived at passport control when perplexity began to set in.
Signs pointed to two queues: one for "Mexicanos" ("Mexicans"), another for "Extranjeros" ("Foreigners").
I stood there for a few seconds, unsure which one to go to.
I grew up in Central California and have been called "Mexicans" all my life.
An ethnic abbreviation - just as my friends in Boston call themselves "Irish" or my friends in New York call themselves "Italians."
Later, I opted for "Mexican-American."
But this was Mexico.
And in my grandfather's homeland, there was no need for abbreviations or hyphens.
I was just an American.
I speak Spanish, at least well enough to hold my own in that language at both ends of an interview.
But I don't have the vocabulary of a native speaker, and I can't get rid of my American accent either.
So I took my American passport and joined the queue for extra jeros.
I thought about that moment this week, when future Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto visited the White House to meet with President Obama.
On the agenda were all the issues expected when the heads of these two countries meet: immigration, drugs, and trade.
Pena Nieto was also keen to talk about the growth of Mexico's economy, which is one reason that Mexicans are now just as likely to stay in Mexico rather than emigrate to the United States.
He wants to join forces with the United States and Canada and create a North American trading bloc along the lines of the European Union.
And Pena Nieto vowed to continue Mexico's war on drug cartels, though he gave no details.
Mexico's relationship with the United States is complicated and fraught with resentment.
Most Americans probably never waste a single thought on the fact that the United States invaded Mexico in 1848, forcing the country's leaders at gunpoint to surrender more than half their territory to them.
But for Mexicans who think in centuries, not minutes, memories of that event are hard to ignore.
So, as soon as a US official makes the slightest criticism of Mexico, there are complaints - in the Mexican press and among the country's elites - about how Americans are pressuring their neighbor's sovereignty.
And the children of Montezuma go on the warpath.
And yet, in truth, Mexico's biggest challenge is its relationship with the more than 35 million Mexican-Americans living in the United States.
Fancy talking about resentment?
There is more than enough.
Mexico has winners and losers - people for whom the country offers opportunities and others for whom it does not.
The only reason why so many people of Mexican descent live in cities like Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver, or San Antonio is because at one point in our family tree, a person - perhaps a parent or grandparent - was not offered a chance in Mexico and migrated north.
And in most cases this person corresponded to a profile - dark-skinned, uneducated, from a poor village, etc.
We are the descendants of these people and we are faithful to them.
Not Mexico.
And while we may now be living the American dream, attending good schools, and getting good jobs, we must never lose sight of the fact that it is the American dream that we are living - not the Mexican dream.
Our identity may sometimes be blurry, but when it comes to our loyalty, that is not the case.
This is clearly for the United States.
We are also aware that many members of Mexico's ruling class do not like us.
This is reciprocal.
They see us as a monument to a humiliating defeat and look down on us because we are not good enough.
Our Spanish will never be good enough, our ties to Mexico will never be strong enough.
In their opinion, our existence is a symbol of failure.
If our families hadn't failed in Mexico, they wouldn't have gone.
And then we would not now find ourselves trapped behind the silk curtain - with a comfortable life in the United States, but somehow lost.
My wife, who was born in Guadalajara and immigrated to the United States legally as a child, reminds me that tensions exist between Mexicans and Mexican-Americans because Mexicans have a clearer idea of who they are - and Mexican-Americans resent it.
While she is an American citizen, she sees herself as part of two countries.
But many Mexican Americans I know feel they don't belong to either country.
We love the Mexican band Los Tigres del Norte, but also Bruce Springsteen.
One enjoys the best of both worlds, but is rooted in neither.
In Mexico, we are seen as Americans.
And in the United States, we are seen as Mexicans.
As I learned during my trip, there is something that complicates this relationship: some Mexican leaders and parts of the educated bourgeoisie want to reconnect with the diaspora.
They want to appoint Mexican Americans as temporary "ambassadors" for Mexico, representing their interests in the United States.
We should tell our American colleagues how great it is to visit this country and put pressure on the political leaders to strengthen their ties with Mexico.
Well.
That's not going to happen.
Too many hurt feelings.
And, given the unjust distribution of income, rampant corruption, and drug violence, many of us are not so sure that this is really a great country.
I'm afraid you'll have to go through this on your own, amigos.
That's fair.
If at least some Mexicans are not yet ready to forgive the United States for dealing with Mexico a century and a half ago, they must also accept that some Mexican Americans hold grudges for the way their family members were treated not so long ago.
Hmmm.
Maybe we're more "Mexican" than I thought.
Old Skirmishes, New Middle East
The ceasefire between Israel and Hamas may prove to be an unexpected cornerstone of peace
Can there ever be lasting peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East?
The recent bloody events seem to have nipped such hope in the bud.
Amid the usual finger-pointing, countless buildings have been reduced to rubble, more than 140 Palestinians, most of them civilians, and six Israelis have been killed - and for the first time rockets from Gaza have struck near Israel's metropolis of Tel Aviv and the holy city of Jerusalem.
But, while Israelis and Palestinians seem trapped in their historic conflict, the Middle East is changing around them.
The Arab Spring has created a new, uncertain situation, and whether they like it or not, Palestinians and Israelis have become part of that turmoil.
Perhaps this will only lead to more bloodshed.
But there are reasons to believe that the deadly standoff may finally be coming to an end.
A war that is neither lost nor won
At first glance, optimism about the current situation seems far from justified.
Even if the ceasefire agreed on November 21 holds, this week's fighting has strengthened hard-liners on both sides.
The leaders of Hamas, the Islamist movement that has controlled the Gaza Strip since 2007, will claim to have pushed back the Israelis, even though his group itself suffered heavy losses.
Although several Hamas leaders have been killed and Gaza's 1.7 million inhabitants are crammed into one of the most desolate and densely populated corners of the planet, Israel has so far failed to destroy Hamas.
Indeed, Hamas is gaining ground in the West Bank, which is controlled by the rival, moderate Palestinian group Fatah.
And Hamas leaders may conclude that time is on their side.
As Islamists have gained influence in the Arab world, Hamas has enlisted powerful and wealthy friends.
Turkey, a resurgent regional power once considered Israel's closest Muslim ally, has sided with Hamas, as has Qatar, one of the richest and most dynamic Gulf states.
Jubilant Hamas supporters believe that an Islamist crescent is forming around Israel - from Lebanon in the north, where the militant group Hezbollah is in power, to Syria, where increasingly Islamist-leaning rebels could be poised to topple Bashar Assad, to Jordan, where Hamas allies threaten the king.
And, in particular, the rise of the Muslim Brotherhood under President Muhammad Morsi in Egypt - by far the most populous and important Arab country - on Israel's southern flank has altered the region's balance profoundly.
Hosni Mubarak, the secular despot who ruled Egypt for 30 years until his overthrow in 2011, had little time for Hamas.
By contrast, the Brotherhood is allied with Hamas, and its leaders are more dependent on popular opinion.
In future diplomatic negotiations, Hamas may turn out to be an actor that cannot be pushed out even by Israel and the United States.
Israeli hardliners, on the other hand, draw the opposite conclusion.
In military terms, Hamas is no longer a threat.
Israel's Iron Dome anti-missile system has proved its worth, and many of Hamas's rockets have been destroyed.
For a while at least, Israel will be able to sleep more peacefully.
Diplomatically, the United States remains steadfast in its position, with many European countries blaming Hamas for the latest escalation of violence.
Israel has fared well in recent years, especially under Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu, who has largely ignored the peace process.
Although rockets from Gaza have killed about 30 Israelis since 2004, the country has remained relatively free of suicide bombers, thanks in no small part to the barrier that runs into the West Bank, the main part of any Palestinian state, protecting Jewish settlements that have been declared illegal under international law but are expanding.
Netanyahu is doing well, with his Likud party allied with an even more combative group under Avigdor Lieberman in the run-up to elections on January 22.
Why pamper these deceitful Palestinians and give them their own state?
If they were really in control of the West Bank, wouldn't they be firing rockets, just like their comrades in Gaza?
No, it is better to keep them at bay behind the wall and punish them if they dare to raise their heads.
Perhaps the hard-liners will prevail, but the Arab Spring may put a spanner in the works.
Even if the Islamists now in power in Egypt and elsewhere have little left for Israel, they will focus first on the difficulties at home.
Israel's defense budget is larger than that of its four Arab neighbors combined.
War with the local superpower will do little to help the new Arab governments repair their economies.
That pragmatic President Morsi teamed up with Barack Obama to reach a cease-fire could be a promising sign - and perhaps symbolize the beginning of a new era.
Israelis, too, should think longer term.
While the rest of the Arab world takes tentative steps toward democratization, Palestinians continue to be deprived of their right to self-determination - a powder keg that will undoubtedly explode one day in the Israeli-occupied territories, just as a bus exploded in Tel Aviv this week.
The oppression is already undermining democracy in the Jewish state, and the growth of the Arab population will only exacerbate this situation.
Bloody missions to push back Hamas in Gaza will increasingly take their diplomatic toll over the years.
Both sides need an outside push
The correct answer is the one represented by the more sensible representatives of both sides, most of the rest of the world and this newspaper: two states in which Israel cedes territory for security purposes.
The hope - small for the near future - is that the ceasefire will give outsiders more leverage to enforce it.
Egypt, together with Turkey and Qatar, must now stop the flow of arms to Gaza, and is better positioned than ever to convince Hamas of the idea of a Jewish state based on the 1967 borders, supplemented by land swaps and a shared Jerusalem.
Outside Arab nations should also get Hamas and Fatah to come to an agreement.
That would do more for the creation of a Palestinian state than the forthcoming application for UN observer status.
Obama, too, must play his part in getting Israel to negotiate.
During his first term, he failed to present his own peace plan.
Far from the White House, it seems he is equally averse to involvement.
But this is a regrettable, short-sighted prospect.
The United States has a vital interest in a stable Middle East.
And that includes a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.
Australian plain cigarette packaging laws come into force
Health warnings and diseased body parts on neutral green packs that are the same for all tobacco brands
The world's first standardised cigarette and tobacco packaging laws have come into force in Australia, replacing brand logos and colours with neutral, olive green lids, which are also printed with graphic images depicting diseased body parts and babies and children sickened by cigarette smoke.
From next Saturday, apart from the various health warnings and images, the only difference between the packs in the brand names, which are printed in identical, small lettering, will be the difference.
This means that Australia has the world's strictest regulations on tobacco packaging.
The Australian federal government wants to discourage young people from smoking by removing the glamorous image of smoking.
The government assumes that studies have shown that people who have not started smoking by the age of 26 are 99% more likely to stop after that.
"You can already see in young children that they understand the message that tobacco companies are trying to promote with their brand image," says Federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersek. She cites studies that have shown, for example, that children associate the crown of a logo with the idea of a princess.
Although Australia has one of the lowest smoking rates in the world, and the changes will have only a marginal impact on multinationals "profits, other countries are already considering similar steps.
The tobacco lobby fought hard against the legislation.
It was said that the laws favoured the black-market trade, resulting in cheaper and more accessible cigarettes.
"The laws will have serious, unintended consequences," said Scott McIntyre of British American Tobacco Australia.
Chinese and Indonesian counterfeiters will offer much larger quantities of these products on the streets of Australia.
Others, however, say the laws have boosted their business.
Sandra Ha of Zico Import Pty Ltd, a small family business, notes that demand for cigarette cases and silicone lids to cover the unbearable packaging has soared since British American Tobacco, Britain's Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco failed to challenge the laws in Australia's Supreme Court two months ago.
Zico has sold up to 6,000 units to wholesale stores and is awaiting new inventory, he said.
It's a good deal for us.
According to experts, the catch in the popularity of social media is the very demographic targeted by the plan.
A series of Australian laws have banned tobacco companies from TV advertising, banned them from appearing as sports sponsors and forced most retailers to stop putting cigarettes in shops. Tobacco advertising has now moved to the internet.
The Australian government has banned internet advertising by local companies and sites, but has no influence on international sites.
"If you market tobacco and have only a small area left to advertise your products, you can't avoid the internet," says Becky Freeman, a public health researcher at the University of Sydney.
On social media such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook, Freeman has noticed a rise in testimonials about brands written by "ordinary people."
One has to ask the question: Is this just a private person who likes Marlboro cigarettes so much that he even makes a video for them - or does a marketing agency have anything to do with it?
British American Tobacco Australia says the industry is focusing on dealing with the new laws rather than on marketing.
It has even gone so far as to pay Ukraine, Honduras, and the Dominican Republic to challenge the new rules - countries that complain to the World Trade Organization about unfair trade restrictions, even though none of them trade much with Australia.
A WTO ruling is expected in mid-2013.
Plibersek said the government had held talks with other countries considering similar packaging laws.
Canada was the first country to impose photographic warnings in 2001.
These have now been extended to more than 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
Tougher laws are being considered in Britain, New Zealand, South Africa and India.
Many Australian smokers are defiant.
The pictures don't affect me.
I just ignore them.
"You just take a dump and put the box away," says Victor El Hage, buying a pack of cigarettes with a photo of an oral tumor printed on it.
Honestly, there's only one reason I would quit, and that's my little girl.
James Yu, who runs the King of the Pack tobacco store in Sydney's inner city, says the uniform packaging has made it difficult to top up his shelves.
"It used to take me an hour to sort a delivery, now I need four," Yu says.
"The government should have just banned cigarettes completely - then we'd have told ourselves okay, that's it, we're going to shut up," he adds, visibly upset.
In a constantly electrified world, it's nice to be bored
This Thanksgiving, I unexpectedly spent five hours in the airport when our plane broke down due to mechanical problems and we had to wait for another plane.
So I had plenty of time to think about boredom.
I'm not going to lie.
Waiting half a day at the airport for a flight is pretty nerve-wracking - even when books, magazines, and iPhones (and, of course, tax-free shopping) are available.
But more and more academics and child development experts cite boredom as something positive.
When it comes to them, it's okay for us - and our children - to be bored occasionally.
This forces the brain to get lost in interesting thought processes, which may encourage creativity.
And because most of us stare at one screen or another almost all the time these days, the benefits of boredom are no longer with us.
So should we welcome boredom with open arms?
Yes.
And no.
I will come back to that.
Like many people, I have always assumed that boredom is a relatively recent phenomenon that has developed with increasing leisure time.
But Peter Toohey, professor of Greek and Roman history at the University of Calgary in Canada and author of "Boredom: A Lively History" (Yale University Press, 2011), doesn't see it that way.
"In fact, boredom has a very long history," he says.
The walls of Pompeii are adorned with Latin graffiti about boredom dating back to the first century.
And then there is the question of how we actually define boredom.
According to John D. Eastwood, an associate professor of psychology at the University of York in Ontario, Canada, the problem is that boredom has been defined and discussed in many ways.
After long reading of research literature and presenting the idea to a focus group of about 100 people, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues concluded that boredom can be defined as the experience of "wanting to do a satisfying activity but not being able to do it."
Boredom differs from apathy in that the person is not busy but wants to be.
In the case of apathy, however, there is no urge to do anything.
The key experience of boredom, he says, is a "disturbance of the attention process, coupled with a bad mood and the feeling that time is passing slowly."
Boredom can sound almost like depression.
But Professor Eastwood believes that although these two conditions may be related, bored people see the problem in their environment or the world, while depressed people see the problem in themselves.
Sometimes we think that we are bored, even if we only have difficulty concentrating.
In their study "The Unengaged Mind: Defining Boredom in Terms of Attention," published in September in the journal "Perspectives on Psychological Science," Professor Eastwood and his colleagues point to an earlier experiment in which participants listened to a tape in which a person read a magazine article.
Some groups listened to a loud television program from the adjacent room that had nothing to do with its content, others listened to it at low volume, making it barely perceptible, while the third group did not hear these sounds at all.
Those who listened to the barely audible television reported feeling more bored than the other two groups - they had trouble concentrating, could not find a reason for it, and attributed their difficulties to boredom.
When you try to focus on a difficult or stressful task, attention disruption can lead to boredom, says Mark J. Fenske, an associate professor of neuroscience at the University of Guelph in Ontario and one of the study's authors.
If, on the other hand, you are engaged in a monotonous activity - "like finding faulty products on a factory conveyor belt, music can distract and help you not to feel bored."
In fact, he says, we now know that wriggling and scribbling, often interpreted as a sign of boredom, can actually combat it by keeping people physically more alert.
"Studies have shown that children who are allowed to run around learn more and retain more information than those who are forced to sit still," Professor Fenske said.
We all get bored at some point - my delayed flight, a booming loudspeaker, a particularly tiresome film.
But some people are more easily bored than others.
To measure these differences, researchers developed a "boredom susceptibility scale" in the 1980s.
On the scale are statements such as "many things I have to do are repeated and monotonous" and "I have so many interests that I don't have enough time for everything."
Using such scales, researchers have found that boys get bored more often than girls, according to Stephen Vodanovich, a professor of psychology at the University of West Florida - especially when it comes to the need for more and a greater variety of external stimuli.
But in general, teenagers are a pretty jaded bunch.
In 1991, Reed Larson, a professor of human and community development at the University of Illinois, conducted an experiment in which he used a pager to contact nearly 400 teenagers and their parents seven to eight times a day.
It found that 32% of adolescents were bored at school and doing homework, while 23% said they were bored when they were not at school.
But only 3% of parents said they felt bored.
Now, 21 years later, Professor Larson says he doesn't know if the percentages of boredom have gone up or down.
However, he is sure that "young people are perceived as particularly boring," mainly because children and teenagers do not have much influence on their daily routine.
So back to my original question: is boredom healthy?
Sometimes not, because in extreme cases it leads to people taking extreme physical risks and falling into gambling or drugs to alleviate them - studies have shown.
On the other hand, many philosophers and authors examine the relationship between boredom and creativity. This is the opinion of Professor Vodanovich, who has been researching the subject for more than two decades.
"With boredom, the brain wants to tell you to do something different," said Gary Marcus, a professor of psychology at the University of New York.
But the brain does not always know what to do best.
If you are bored and you use this energy to play guitar and cook, you will be happy.
But while television can bring happiness in the short term, it will evaporate in the long run.
So if you hand your bored child an iPad, it can dissuade him from boredom, but he hasn't learned to entertain or control himself, says Professor Fenske.
And he adds: "Self-control transfers from one situation to another."
The child not only learns to entertain, but also gains more self-control in other areas.
I don't think we should celebrate boredom.
Nor should we be too critical of them.
Instead, our goal should be to feel comfortable away from the constant drip-feed of activity and technology.
Professor Eastwood agrees.
"It sounds as if we need to be bored more often, but boredom is the nagging, incessant desire to do something meaningful," he says.
He believes that people are really just looking for a way to switch off and relax.
"In an environment where we are constantly overstimulated, it is difficult to occupy ourselves once the noise has stopped."
In Colorado, No Clear Guidance for New Marijuana Law
Nineteen-year-old community college student and football player Anthony Orozco is on trial in southeastern Colorado for a misdemeanor that will soon be legal in that state: possession of a few marijuana rocks and a pipe with which he smoked them.
According to Orozco, he and some friends were driving in Lamar, near the Kansas border, on a September day when they were stopped.
After the police officer found marijuana in the car, Orozco was subpoenaed for possession of drugs and drug paraphernalia - felonies that carry a $100 fine each - and given a court date.
"We are being treated like criminals," Orozco said.
But is he one?
In the uncertain weeks following the state's decision to legalize small amounts of marijuana for personal use, the answer for hundreds of minor drug offenses depends less on the law than on location.
Hundreds of misdemeanors involving marijuana have already been dropped here and in Washington state, which approved similar measures.
Police authorities no longer prosecute adults over the age of 21 for small-scale possession, which will be allowed by law once the new laws come into force in the next few weeks.
But prosecutors in Colorado's more conservative districts have said they will pursue existing marijuana offenses and are still citing people in court.
At the same time, several cities, from the Denver suburbs to the Western Mountains, are voting to prevent new, state-licensed marijuana shops from opening in their communities.
"This situation is evolving so fast that I don't know what's going to happen next," said Daniel J. Oates, police chief in Aurora, which is east of Denver.
Regulators in Washington state are also scratching their heads.
They are waiting for guidance on setting up a licensing system for the production, manufacture, distribution and sale of the drug, with a deadline of 1 December 2013.
In Washington, the view is that Colorado is ahead of most states in regulating marijuana, where the drug was legalized first for medical use and then for personal use.
"Colorado has a more regulated market, so the state is well placed for guidance," said Brian E. Smith, a spokesman for the Washington State spirits regulator.
But Smith also acknowledges that no place or system can do more than serve as a rough guide.
"We don't have a real precedent to follow," he adds.
The Washington law, called I-502, goes into effect on December 6, also marking the end of a gray area where the state licensing system does not yet exist, but ownership is legalized.
And uncomfortable practical issues must be resolved during this time - for example, how to reconcile the state's requirement of "reasonable access" to licensed marijuana with the prohibition of cannabis shops within 300 meters of schools, parks, playgrounds, and childcare facilities.
"Nowhere will it be more difficult to find a location for a licensed cannabis business than in urban areas, especially in the metropolitan area of Seattle," says Ben Livingston, spokesman for the Center for Legal Cannabis, a recently formed research group.
On 21 November, Chief Oates sent an e-mail to his staff in Aurora saying that the district attorney would no longer prosecute minor marijuana offenses in people over the age of 21, and that police would not seek criminal charges for those offenses "as of now."
Chief Oates added that police would continue to enforce city guidelines to regulate growers of medical marijuana and drug traffickers would continue to be prosecuted.
In Weld County in northern Colorado, District Attorney Ken Buck takes a stricter view.
After the vote, he said his agency would continue to prosecute marijuana possession cases, mainly to encourage users to withdraw.
Currently, 119 people face trial for possession of about 50 grams or less of marijuana, though many have also been charged with other offenses.
"Our agency has a duty to prosecute violations that were criminal at the time of the crime," Buck said in a statement.
Responses have been mixed, even in places like rural Mesa County, where voters rejected the marijuana initiative.
Police in Grand Junction, the county's largest city, no longer charge adults for possession of small amounts.
District Attorney Pete Hautzinger supported the decision, but also decided not to drop all pending possession cases.
"I don't think I'm wasting my time enforcing the law until it changes," he says.
Although 55% of Colorado voters supported the measure, it was clear from the outset that it would not be easy to reconcile personal marijuana use with the complexities of government and the legal system.
And the contradictory responses across the state exposed a deep dichotomy among local officials about the great green experiment.
District attorneys are a "cultural barrier," said Sean McAllister, a Denver lawyer who represents defendants on trial for marijuana offenses and is a local spokesman for the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws.
"They have spent so much of their lives prosecuting people that they still cannot accept legalisation," he says.
As the first states to treat small amounts of marijuana like alcohol, Colorado and Washington are seen as national model cases for legalizing drugs.
As advocates and state officials prepare for an age of legal sales, they are also nervously awaiting instructions from the federal government, which wants to continue to treat the sale and cultivation of marijuana as a federal crime.
Advocates of the legalization movement hope the Justice Department will relent.
Despite several high-profile arrests of users and sellers of medical marijuana, the federal government has largely allowed medical marijuana to be sold in Colorado, Washington and 16 other states.
Kevin A. Sabet, a former drug policy adviser to the Obama administration, says that while detectives are unlikely to open doors to seize smaller amounts of the drugs, they are likely to be reluctant to tolerate legal, federally regulated marijuana businesses under the new legislation.
Several cities in Colorado are not even waiting for federal authorities to act.
Even before Election Day, some local governments approved moratoriums on new marijuana shops, though they could not open until about a year from now.
Last week, Montrose, a city in the west, imposed a six-month ban, which is expected to be passed next week.
"We don't want to get into a position where we license someone and then face a big problem at the federal level," said Bob Nicholson, a City Council member.
Our community voted against this amendment to the law.
We are guided by what the community has chosen, not by what the state has chosen.
Many questions remain unanswered.
Petronella Wyatt: I was bullied out of Oxford because I'm a Tory
It's not just today's university students who are being attacked for their views
It had always been my greatest dream to get a place at Oxford University.
Both my father and older brother had attended what I once thought was the world's greatest temple of knowledge, a modern Greek symposium that promoted the great pillars of civilization - free thought and tolerance.
But within two weeks of enrolling at Worcester College in the late Eighties - where I had planned to study history - I had packed my bags again, causing the first scandal of my life.
My father broke down in tears.
My friends were confused.
The Evening Standard said I left because I had a problem with fellow students having sex in the adjacent room.
Author A N Wilson mischievously explained that I had left university because I was forced to drink from damaged cups.
But the truth was less amusing.
I ran away.
Yes, because I suffered from systematic bullying and threats.
Not because of my rather unusual name, or because I came from a private school.
I had been harassed for one reason only - a reason that seemed all the more narrow-minded and cruel in this supposed cradle of enlightenment: my late father, Woodrow Wyatt, had been a key adviser to Margaret Thatcher, and I was a supporter of the Conservative Party.
Why am I mentioning this now?
Well, according to recent reports, a new generation of moderate-right students is suffering similar persecution.
Such is the organised and growing hatred of Tory students at Oxford that a group of them last week called for equal protection for gays, the disabled and ethnic minorities.
Conservative members of Corpus Christi College's Junior Common Room (JCR) say they are often "actively isolated, personally attacked and declared undesirable" because of their political views.
They are demanding a place on their college's equality committee to ensure that their opinions can be freely expressed.
Their situation was made worse by a recent BBC Two documentary about political students, Wonderland: Young, Bright and on the Right, which portrayed Tories as eccentrics and neo-Nazis.
They included former president of the Oxford University Conservative Association, Joe Cooke, who used to drive a Rolls-Royce and show off his silver suit and walking stick.
At other universities, Conservative students say they are seen as "scapegoats for introducing higher tuition fees."
Luke Black, 20, vice-president of Nottingham University's Conservative Students' Association, told a Sunday newspaper: 'There is a growing Left-wing bias in universities.
People think we're like the Bullingdon Club without even knowing each other. '
Samuel Roberts, 21, a history student at Corpus Christi who initiated the petition for greater protections, says such a climate is "uncomfortable." Stephanie Cherill, 19, president-elect of the Oxford Conservative Students "Association, says she has seen a growing dislike of students from the center-right among JCR members.
"This is a danger to intellectual discourse and to the well-being of members," she says.
In my first few weeks at Oxford, I was in such a minority.
As an incredibly shy 18-year-old, I arrived in September 1986.
The hatred of the Conservative Party was at its height.
The previous year, the university had voted not to award an honorary degree to Margaret Thatcher - a former student - because of cuts to higher education.
The atmosphere would have alarmed even Stalinists.
In the first few days of the freshman week, when new students get to know each other and the tutors, I got a foretaste of what was to come.
I learned that the tutors not only tolerated the mockery of Tory students, but actually enjoyed it.
Political issues such as the miners "strike, privatisation and the government's refusal to impose sanctions on South Africa's apartheid regime found their way into the wood-panelled rooms of the tutorial.
At the first of these events, I was asked to translate French texts from the 18th century into English. I was not prepared for what was to come.
"Miss Wyatt," said the tutor Harry Pitt (now deceased), "please translate the first paragraph."
I stumbled.
Pitt was a small man with a cake-dough-like face, and quite spiteful.
"Do Thatcher supporters refuse to learn French, or are they just stupid?" he asked me.
The other students giggled.
Tears welled up in my eyes.
"I suggest they take a couple of French lessons in your spare time - so if you're not too busy with your social activities," Pitt growled at me.
I returned to my room with my head down.
That evening in college, I was sitting alone at dinner when someone gently tapped me on the shoulder.
It was a second-year English student named James who introduced himself as a member of the Conservative Students Association.
"I know who you are," he said kindly.
Unfortunately, it is as it is.
Anyone suspected of being a Tory is being bullied.
It's bad enough for me, but they know your father is close to Margaret Thatcher, so it will be worse for you.
Most Tory freshmen pretend to be Labour supporters.
Later, in a local pub, I tried to disguise myself.
I insisted that I did not agree with Mrs Thatcher on every point.
This trick was to prove unsuccessful.
A freshman in philosophy, politics and economics, who ironically went to Eton College, which is considered conservative, said to me: "You're the daughter of a fascist pig."
You're dirty.
Other students shared his opinion.
I was perverted and dirty.
"How do Tories have sex?" one asked me.
They beat each other, don't they?
I felt the way homosexuals must have felt before the more liberal legislation of the United States.
Would I ever manage to lead a normal life at Oxford University?
Would I be able to meet like-minded people only after dark?
Should I turn to the Labour Party and suppress my natural inclinations?
The three years that lay ahead of me stretched before my spiritual eye into a purgatory of ostracism and isolation.
The only tutor who openly identified himself as a Tory was Norman Stone, a professor of contemporary history who was based in my college.
He was hated not only for being a Conservative, but also for advising Thatcher on foreign policy and making speeches for her.
He was rarely there.
He hated the place, found it provincial and petty, and rejected it for its Marxist-deterministic historical perspective.
In 1997 he accepted a professorship at Bilkent University in Ankara, Turkey.
"You're not going to be happy here," he told me.
I began commuting between Oxford and my parents "house, finding refuge with more open-minded friends and family in the city.
I told my father I hated Oxford and why I did it.
He seemed incredulous.
During his time in the Forties, all political views were accepted.
"But it's the best place in the world," he said sheepishly.
They would never do that, not in my town of dreaming spires.
Even my communist friends always displayed impeccable manners.
His damp eyes darkened.
Give it a chance.
I'm sure they're just teasing you.
It would break my heart if you left.
Exhausted by my frequent trips to London, my emotional resistance weakened.
One of my male friends, also a Tory supporter, had bowed to pressure and renounced his beliefs.
During a tutorial the following week, in which another history tutor had earnestly claimed that I was "an enemy of the people," I decided to do the same.
Although I secretly fainted with shame, I admitted that my parents had "brainwashed" me and called them "old idiots."
The relief was short-lived.
It was my father who put the final nail in the coffin of my Oxford career.
At the time, he was writing two columns a week in the Murdoch press.
My door was locked.
I hid in my room, and after five minutes my captors gave up.
When they left, I packed a suitcase and took the first train to London.
I never returned.
Feel free to call me a whiny floppy tail.
But no 18-year-old should ever have to endure such intimidation and viciousness in an educational establishment.
And, even more tragically, it was Oxford - a university that not only produced 14 Tory prime ministers, but still has an undeserved reputation for equality and freedom of thought.
"Valentino prefers elegance to celebrity"
ABC spoke to Naty Abascal, Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza and other famous clients of the Italian fashion designer at the "Valentino - Masters of Couture" exhibition, which opened in London this week.
Somerset House, the former residence of Isabel I of England, is the only place in the British capital worthy of hosting an exhibition on Valentino Garavani.
This was acknowledged by the designer at the opening of "Valentino - Master of Couture," a magnificent retrospective that brings together more than 130 haute couture dresses created by his "Maison" over the last 50 years.
"I love this palace," he says in his distinctive Italian accent.
This exhibition concludes a story whose sole protagonist is "il signore" Garavani, but which could not have been written without his distinguished clientele.
Valentino always had a fascination for the stuffy and distant world of the aristocracy.
In the first room of this exhibition, which runs until 3 March, there are a large number of private letters and photographs signed by the most distinguished aristocracy, from Princess Salimah Aga Khan to Princess Marie-Chantal of Greece and Margarita of England to Lord Snowdon.
Valentino presents these personal memories as trophies of his social rise from humble fashionista in the town of Voghera in northern Italy to the idol of the international jet set.
Being in love with the nobility does not have to be a disadvantage.
"At least they don't step out on your gorgeous carpet like some beautiful celebrities do in pop music," says Baroness Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza.
In the 60s and 70s, the two lived in the Alps and were good friends.
Valentino is a spectacular, generous and elegant host.
"We were all delighted when we were invited to his house in Gstaad," explains the ex-wife of "Heini" Thyssen, a close friend of forgotten beauties such as Marella Agnelli and Eugenie Niarchos.
Valentino has always preferred elegance to celebrity.
And yet he is a star.
Valeria Mazza, in a dress by Valentino
The Argentine model Valeria Mazza also does not forget the charisma of the fashion designer.
Many years ago, after a fashion show in Piazza di Spagna in Rome, we went to his house for dinner.
There were about 20 of us, including Sharon Stone and John Kennedy Jr.
His influence could be seen and felt in every detail of his apartment, the decoration, the food and the music.
"All those invited felt important and loved," recalls the "top model," who began her career at Haute Couture Week in Paris in 1995.
"He never goes out of fashion because his designs are works of art," she concludes.
Fashion show of origin
The life of Garavani is not a story of obsession, but rather of mutual love.
He likes people with good upbringing and the highest titles, and they love him.
One of the galleries in Somerset House has been transformed into a glorious 60-metre-long catwalk that proposes a reversal of roles: the user takes the model's place and walks down the catwalk to admire a dreamy "audience" wearing Valentino masterpieces, such as the dress Jackie Kennedy chose for her wedding to Aristóteles Onassis, the costumes Monica Vitti wore in "La Notte," or a wool and leather coat belonging to Empress Farah Diba.
Names like Sibilla de Luxemburgo, Gloria von Thurn und Taxis, Mette-Marit of Norway, Rosario of Bulgaria or Sofia of Habsburg shine in this audience of fashion dolls.
Naty Abascal and the Fashion Maker, 2006
Many of these clients say the first Valentino, like the first love, is "unforgettable."
I remember it perfectly.
It was a pair of trousers, a shirt, a Gillette vest and a jacket from the autumn / winter 1971-1972 collection.
"It was a gift from him," says Naty Abascal, one of the designer's muses.
"I prefer him to everyone else because of his great love for women and because he emphasizes our beauty," the ex-Duchess of Cambridge added.
I like the colours he uses a lot; they have a lot of light and accentuate the face.
The proportions are perfect.
The princess and fashion expert Patricia della Giovampaola d'Arenberg can't forget the first time she wore a Valentino.
When I lived in Italy as a teenager, I dreamed of finally having the age and opportunity to wear one of his evening gowns...
At the end of the nineties, this finally happened.
I bought my first Valentino dress for a party at the castle of my cousin, Prince Edouard de Ligne.
It was a red dress with a flying skirt and a draped bodice with a cleavage worthy of its name.
"It was a dream come true," says Rodrigo d'Arenberg's widow.
"Valentino does not depend on fashion, his obsession is timeless," explains this Italian aristocrat, who lives between Paris, New York and Buenos Aires.
Princess D'Arenberg keeps her evening gowns by the designer "with absolute care, because a dress is not only a dress, but also the memories associated with it."
The "king" of fashion
The grand finale of the exhibition at Somerset House is Marie-Chantal Miller's wedding dress for her 1995 wedding to Pablo de Grecia.
It took four months of work and 25 "magazines" (as the fashion designer called his seamstresses) to make this ivory silk dress with pearls, twelve different embroideries and a four and a half metre long tail.
According to journalist Suzy Menkes, the supreme authority of the trade press, this dress was a milestone in haute couture at the end of the twentieth century, "the return to the customers of the highest society."
Marred for years by the "savoir-être" of the elite, Valentino is now its best specimen.
Cavaliere di Gran Croce (the highest award in Italy), Cavaliere del Lavoro, Commandeur de L'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres, awarded the Legion of Honour, Garavani accumulates as many honours as each of the husbands of his clients.
"I have always noticed his refinement, his calmness, his neat and perfect appearance," admits D'Arenberg.
I last saw him a month ago at a gala dinner at the Museum de Orsay.
He was sitting at the table of Countess Jacqueline de Ribes, a very good friend of mine.
'He was flawless; time doesn't leave a mark on him. '
And this is what a princess says...
The most difficult profession in the world: the human workhorses of Kawah Ijen
For four euros, the porters of the Indonesian volcano risk their lives and health by carrying 70 kilos of sulphur along the steep, rocky paths.
There are people for whom their work is hell, and others literally work in hell.
This is the case with Anto Wijaya, one of the 400 miners who earn their lives by extracting sulphur from the Kawah Ijen volcano in the east of the Indonesian island of Java.
To do this, it must descend every day to the bottom of its crater, where the sulphurous gas emanating from the earth solidifies in contact with the air.
After breaking out large sulphur stones, which can weigh up to 70 kilos in total, he carries them in two bamboo baskets on his shoulders along the steep stone paths.
It is only 250 meters to the top of the volcano, which rises to a height of 2386 meters, but the exhausted porters need more than 40 minutes to climb at turtle speed, keeping their balance and carefully setting their steps so that they do not slip and fall.
They know that every step can cost their lives, as happened to a French tourist who fell on the cliffs of Kawah Ijen years ago.
The miners of Kawah Ijen earn 5 euro cents for every kilo of sulphur they extract.
Once at the top, they make their way between the tourists, who photograph them like circus monkeys, and walk three kilometres with the tiresomely heavy baskets to the scales, which a mining company has set up a little further down at an altitude of 1850 metres.
The company is PT Candi Ngrimbi, which since 1960 has exploited the deposits in the volcano and (never better said) its workers, to whom it pays 662 Indonesian rupees (5 euro cents) for each kilo of sulphur.
They then sell it to the petrochemical industry for 10,000 rupees (83 euro cents) each, because this mineral is widely used in everyday life and is used to make matches, fireworks, cosmetics, dynamite and even to bleach sugar.
"Since we normally carry 70 kg, we get about 46,000 rupees (3.8 euros) for each way," explains Anto, who normally does three distances a day.
Each trip takes him three hours, after which he is completely done, but at the end of the day he has 138,000 rupees (11.5 euros) together.
What looks like a miserable reward for such an almost inhuman effort is, however, three times what he would earn from his field work.
"The daily wage of the miners here, where the coffee harvest costs 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros) a day and the average monthly income is two million rupees (167 euros), is very high," explains the porter, who previously worked as a bricklayer on the tourist island of Bali.
There he earned 75,000 rupees (6.2 euros) a day, and the work was not that hard, but Anto and his family returned to Banyuwangi, a village nearby, for a reason as important as sulfur in Indonesia: "I married a girl from Bali, where they are Hindus, and I brought her to Java to convert her to Islam."
Anto has asthma, breathing with difficulty, coughs frequently and his eyes are irritated by the toxic gases.
For the past three years, 27-year-old Anto has been risking his life at Kawah Ijen, whose sulphur has already left its first traces on him, although he covers his face with a mask and special glasses.
Anto has asthma, breathing with difficulty, coughs frequently and his eyes are irritated by the toxic gases from the volcano.
This is the price he has to pay to achieve his dream.
"I'm going to work here for another two years because I want to open a shop or learn Spanish or French," he promises in more than acceptable English.
This likeable and intelligent but troubled young man could work as a tourist guide, waiter or hotel receptionist, but instead he does the work of a stretcher.
He shares a dirty wooden hut with other porters and gets up every morning at two o'clock, because the sulfur also emanates at night, where its characteristic yellow color shines bluish in the darkness.
Challenging the shadows, he climbs into the crater in the light of a small headlamp on his helmet, which he bought with his own money.
About 400 porters load baskets of sulfur on their shoulders on the crater floor.
Despite its large profits, the mining company has not mechanized sulfur extraction in order to save costs and does not supply equipment to the porters, who operate on their own account and are paid by weight.
You will also not receive a share of the 30,000 rupees (2.5 euros) surcharge per camera that the guardians of this natural park, together with the entrance fee of 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros), charge tourists who come to take pictures of the volcano and the human carriers.
"This work is for animals, not humans," protests Madrusin, a burly 42-year-old porter who has been working at Kawah Ijen for three decades since leaving school.
He is able to carry up to 110 kg and assures that he will carry on "as long as possible" because he needs the money to raise his three children aged 10 to 18.
I'm not going to retire, I'm going to die here because the volcano has been my whole life.
Even when the sulfur burns the throat and the eyes itch, when the wind suddenly turns and the miners are trapped in the thick pillars that rise from the crater, the men are so hard that no one complains of serious illnesses... except, of course, the usual breathing problems, osteoarthritis, pain in the knees and blisters on the shoulders that have been deformed by the weight of the baskets.
With the basket on his back, Unainik, 53, is only able to carry 50 kg.
Every day, he and his companions extract 15 tons of sulfur from the volcano, which is transported by three trucks along a goat path through the bushes to the camp in Tamansari, 18 kilometers away.
"I'm not going to retire, I'm going to die here because the volcano has been my whole life," Unainik explains, opening his mouth wide, missing some teeth.
The oldest of his five children, aged 30, also works as a sulphur carrier.
Time passes, but poverty persists generation after generation in one of the toughest professions in the world: those who work as human donkeys at Kawah Ijen.
Singapore needs babies to save economy
Singaporeans blame the lack of children on the career, stress and cost of real estate and parenting.
"The population of Singapore must grow."
I am a patriotic husband, you are my patriotic wife: let us fulfil our civic duty and let us create life!
It seems incredible that the verses are part of an advertisement for mint sweets, but nevertheless - or perhaps because of this - they became a viral video on YouTube in Singapore earlier this year.
The sentences are part of a rapper song that uses local sayings such as "Push a bao" (loaf) in the oven to poke fun at Singapore's low birth rate.
The advertising company BBH, which shot the video, hopes that the commercial will be funny enough to draw attention to the problem.
Its creative director Douglas Hamilton says he wanted to use the power of music to get people to do their "national duty."
This is just for the internet, so we had to make it fun and funny.
It is the biggest problem in this country.
When it comes to reproduction, we are the worst in the world, so we realized that this was an issue we had to deal with.
We knew that the government had tried many things, such as marketing perfume with pheromones or organizing speed-dating evenings (quick flirtations).
It is possible that many of these ideas were creative, but they did not necessarily lead to success.
So we thought: Why not do something as creative as possible to tackle this problem, such as composing a rap?

The one who does not take this issue lightly is the government of Singapore.
Each year, it spends $1,300 on policies to encourage citizens to have more children.
A government package for married couples and parents provides up to $15,000 per child, extends maternity leave and distributes tax benefits.
But it has all had little success so far.
Singapore is a rich, high-tech city-state in Southeast Asia, also known for its rulers "conservatism and strict social controls.
According to its national population agency, the birth rate is currently 1.2 children per woman.
The last time this rate was above 2 - also known as the replacement rate - was in 1976.
So why aren't Singaporeans having more children?
Tan Wei Ming, director of marriage and family policy at the National Population Bureau, says this is due to "better education" and "greater career opportunities."
"This has allowed people to have a lot more options in terms of life goals and priorities other than getting married and starting a family," she says.
These changes in social circumstances have contributed to the increase in the number of single people and to the delay in marriage and births, the result of which is a reduction in the birth rate in Singapore.
Meanwhile, an immigration policy aimed at drastically increasing immigration in order to counteract the reduction in the population has led to resentment among the local population.
In Singapore, there are websites where thinly disguised xenophobia against many new immigrants is flourishing, especially against the Chinese, who are criticized for keeping wages low and not integrating.
The rise in immigration is also seen as one of the reasons that Singapore's ruling party suffered its worst election result since independence last year.
Since the election, an attempt has been made to correct the problem with higher contributions and levies on foreign workers.
Unexpected consequences
While the falling birth rate has the known effects on a nation's economic growth, tax revenues, health care costs, and immigration policies, the example of Singapore also has unexpected consequences.
The government is trying to ensure that not so many small homes are being built.
It is already having an impact on the housing market.
The Municipal Development Authority has begun to control the number of small apartments known as "shoeboxes," which are allowed to be built in certain areas of the city.
These apartments have a living space of 46 square meters and show a great sales success.
However, there are concerns that they may encourage the lifestyle of single people and discourage builders from building large homes for families.
But Lim Yew Soon, chief executive of property firm EL Developers, says his "shoe boxes" sell much faster than larger units.
They are so popular, and the units sell out days and even weeks faster than the larger units.
As a result, they are much better for our cash flow.
He admits, however, that the new standards will give clearer guidance to developers, who have previously faced obstacles if they wanted to build too many small housing units within a project.
Too much stress
Singapore is a city-state.
Even if these new rules could pave the way for a rise in the national birth rate, conversations with Singaporeans working in the financial district suggest that they will not have much effect.
"People are very stressed, housing and education are expensive, which is why a lot of people put it off," says a young manager.
The children can have others.
"For me, it's important to have my own money and time," says another man, about twenty years old.
Men and women cite their careers, stress and the cost of ownership and upbringing as reasons why they cannot have children.
That's why Singaporeans have the final say when it comes to having children - the government can do so much more.
The offline private offline is private online

According to the dictionary, this is a private property, or "that area of private life where you are entitled to protection from any kind of interference."
What is private for someone under 16?
How is this definition applied to his everyday life and social networks?
Does he understand the dangers he faces when he publicizes situations on the Internet that he would not share in real life?
El Periódico interviewed five young people between the ages of 10 and 15, who frequently travel online.
In four of the cases, they linked the term to "something very specific" on a personal level and "to the password and the user" when applying it to social networks.
"I wouldn't share my deepest secrets in a post," says 10-year-old Jorge, trying to explain the meaning of "private" on sites like Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, where he has had accounts for two years.
"These are very confidential secrets, my mother may know them, but not the whole world," he confirms.
On FB I upload nice pictures or pictures of games.
I also spend my time with acquaintances.
"I wouldn't share a photo that's not of me, or of someone making a fool of themselves," he says.
The boy is aware that it is wrong to publish obscene photos, naked, of crimes, or to make offensive or violent comments.
Jorge claims to know 35 friends he has on FB and nine followers on Twitter.
Most are relatives.
This includes the mother who has the password to one of the accounts.
I signed up to Twitter to express myself and write interesting tweets.
"I don't know if anyone is answering me, I'm just uploading them," he adds.
"Social media is entertaining, I can talk to distant relatives or friends very quickly," he says.
Asked, he replied that he would never accept an invitation from an unknown person.
Even if someone recommended a stranger to him, he would ignore it.
The case of 14-year-old José is different.
The teenager has user accounts on Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask. In Ask he admits not to know 20 of the people he has added to his list of friends.
"It doesn't scare me because we have something in common, like music," he says.
According to the boy, no one gave him any hints or asked him for his address or phone number.
"If someone harasses me or asks me to, I just remove them from my account," he admits.
José contacted Ask after reading a recommendation on Twitter.
The boy is no stranger to what is now known as cyberbullying.
An acquaintance of a friend was blackmailed on a social network.
They threatened him and demanded money.
"He never found out who it was," he says.
According to José, the victim did not close the account.
'He's just done it privately. '
He then explains a number of steps to configure a user account securely.
Unlike Jorge, this boy would upload photos of acquaintances in uncomfortable or embarrassing situations.
Yes, I would if he was unlikeable to me or if I wanted to smear him.
"But I know this is cyberbullying," he says.
Key issues
Marielos Porras, an English teacher with a university degree in education and learning, believes that in order to orient children and young people, it is necessary to understand that the purpose of social networks is to inform.
"The internet emerged as a medium for seeking information, but with the appearance of these sites the rules of the game have changed," she says.
Porras explains that the academic Marc Prensky, who holds a master's degree in pedagogy from Yale University and is the author of "Digital Natives and Immigrants," coined these terms to explain the phenomenon.
The digital natives are them, the children and young people who have grown up with this technology.
"We are the digital immigrants who are supposed to teach them, when we are still learning," he says.
He explains that it is a complex issue "because we require them to have a defined criterion about what may be disseminated, published or said, and this at an age when they are not mature enough to do so."
"They should also be picky when the most important thing to them is to be popular, to have thousands of friends, without thinking about the consequences," he adds.
According to the expert, the most effective way to teach children and young people what privacy is is is to ask them questions that make them think.
"Telling them not to do it doesn't work," he says.
Porras then mentions a few possibilities: There are things you wouldn't tell a stranger, so why do you do it on the internet?
Or: Would you like to have a photo of yourself published, like the one you posted from a friend?
Do you know what others say about you?
Did you ask permission from the other people beforehand when you tagged photos of parties?
And one more question: Do everyone need to know what you are doing at every moment?
Another point is to make them understand that they must act online as they do offline.
They are the same rules.
"Someone off the internet acts with respect, morality and other principles, and the same must apply to social networks," he says.

Estuardo Guardia, University Professor, Primary School Teacher and Educational Advisor, comments that it is essential that parents read the social networking guidelines carefully.
If they understand all the paragraphs, they have solid foundations to talk to their children about the importance of opening an account on the Internet.
"For example, age, or what you are allowed to share or publish," he explains.
According to the Guardia, children need to be reminded of the lesson "Don't talk to strangers."
Conclusion of the Unasur Summit without publication of the Lima Declaration
The Sixth Summit of Presidents of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur) ended today in Peru without the publication of the Lima Declaration, which was previously announced and theoretically to be signed by the seven leaders present.
Efe repeatedly tried to gain access to the signed document at the Sixth Ordinary Session of the Heads of State and Government of Unasur. Sources in the State and Presidential Chancellery initially said that they would hand it over after the cloister, but later said that it would be published at some point on the website of the Peruvian government.
When asked about the text, they indicated that the content was presented by the President of Peru, Ollanta Humala, in brief statements to the press.
Journalists' access to information on the summit was restricted at all times.
During the day, only the picture of the presidential meeting was broadcast without sound in the press room with the message "private session, limited audio."
The little information circulating among the journalists was received by the spokespersons of some of the governments of Unasur present at the meeting, but not by the Peruvian press secretary.
The only document circulated during the day was the list of participating presidents, causing unease among the hundreds of journalists from various national and international media who demanded more information.
Afterwards, the President of Peru sent an e-mail to the media with the "final declaration" of the summit, which was, however, Humala's declaration and not the official document concluding the summit.
Last October, Peru hosted the Third Summit of South America and Arab States (ASPA), and on that occasion, too, the so-called Lima Declaration, which had been announced earlier, was not published, despite strong pressure from the press.
The ASPA's official website confirms that the document was published last Tuesday.
At both international meetings, the Peruvian authorities stressed that the information systems for journalists were in place, but they severely restricted access to information.
The Summit also concluded with the joint commitment of Chile and Peru to adopt a judgment of the Court of Justice of The Hague settling a border dispute between the two countries.
The presidents of Peru, Ollanta Humala, and Chile, Sebastián Piñera, met during the regional meeting and confirmed that they would accept the decision of the ICJ, which begins on Monday in The Hague to hear the pleas of both sides in the trial that Lima launched against Santiago.
"We will comply with and execute the verdict on the differences that we are currently presenting to this international court," Humala said along with his Chilean counterpart.
"Chile was, is and will continue to be a country that respects international law, seeks peaceful solutions to disputes, concludes agreements and submits to international courts," Piñera added, greeting Humala with a handshake in front of the flags of both countries.
The confirmation by both presidents that they would submit to the ICJ came after Colombia appealed against the Bogota Agreement, agreeing to submit to the rulings of that international court, following a ruling on maritime borders with Nicaragua that it considered a serious mistake.
The Summit was attended by the Presidents of Brazil, Dilma Rouseff, Venezuela, Hugo Chávez, Bolivia, Evo Morales, and Argentina, Cristina Kirchner.
Paraguay, which has been excluded from Unasur since 2011 following the ouster of its president Fernando Lugo, did not attend the meeting.
Hosting President Ollanta Humala opened the talks in the morning and concluded the summit shortly after noon in Lima.
The head of state read out the final document, in which he announced that 16 decisions had been taken and that the lines of action for 31 projects between the South American countries for a total investment of 17 billion dollars had been established.
Commenting on the decisions taken, he said that the countries of Unasur will "take significant steps towards the goal of South American citizenship, for which we are extending the decisions on residence rights."
He indicated that measures would be taken to "improve cooperation in the fight against urban insecurity and organised transnational crime, as well as measures to improve access to medicines and the Internet at low prices in all areas of South America and to act jointly and efficiently in the event of natural disasters."
With the crisis in Europe, Humala added, "economic consolidation (in Latin America) must not take on triumphant traits, but serve to increase our output and show our peoples a better future."
"We have decided to prioritize a series of 31 emblematic projects aimed at improving spatial links in South America and especially in rural and border areas... thus uniting our countries and opening up new economic forms," the Peruvian President said in a statement read out.
Among these projects would be five Peruvian ones, located on the transverse axes of its territory from the coast to Brazil, two of which are intended to provide a better connection with Ecuador, although he gave no further details.
The final document also referred to the political situation in Paraguay.
"We hope that the electoral process in this country will serve for its resumption in the Union of South American Nations," from which it is currently excluded.
The need for Latin America to remain an integrated region for prosperity and peace, with good neighbourly relations, was another aspect emphasised at the summit.
With this in mind, the President of Colombia, Juan Manuel Santos, said before beginning his participation in the regional meeting that he expected to meet Saturday in Mexico with his counterpart from Nicaragua, Daniel Ortega, in order to treat the maritime conflict respectfully following a ruling by the ICJ challenged by Bogotá.
"I may meet with President Daniel Ortega tomorrow (Saturday)," Santos said.
"We will review all these paths - they are not exclusive, and the agreement with Nicaragua also calls for talks with Nicaragua," he stressed.
"I hope to tell President Ortega that we will treat this matter as civilized and respectful as possible," Santos added.
Santos and Ortega would meet Saturday in Mexico, where they plan to attend the inauguration of the country's new president, Enrique Peña Nieto.
As part of the summit, the bloc's defence ministers also met ahead of the adoption of the 2013 action plan to strengthen dialogue and consensus on defence in the region.
Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chile, Guyana, Suriname and Paraguay are members of UNASUR, although the latter country is currently excluded.
Peru holds the temporary presidency of the regional bloc.
"South America must learn how to integrate its citizens," says Rafael Correa
The President of Ecuador, Rafael Correa, confirmed today that the creation of a common citizenship is an objective where "South America can actually learn something from Europe."
Correa, who attended the 6th Summit of Presidents of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur) held in Lima, told Peru's state television that Europeans "killed themselves in World War II and other conflicts" and "are now practically a fatherland."
In this sense, he defended the project to create a South American citizenship, which the member states of Unasur are pushing forward.
"It is necessary to achieve the free movement of citizens and workers in all South American countries, as is already the case in the Andean Community, but there are still reactionary sectors seeking a return to the past," he warned.
The President of Ecuador also advocated the reorganization of the Organization of American States (OEA) with the aim of reducing the influence of Anglo-Saxon states and taking into account those that signed the San José Convention on Human Rights.
Those who teach never commit to anything, and in return, we South Americans always sign everything.
"It is incomprehensible that the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights is based in Washington and financed by the United States," he said, alluding to the political asylum granted by Ecuador to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange.
Correa said he had no regrets about the decision, saying it was not a betrayal of his principles but of his "deep democratic values and views on human rights."
He added that there had been 'reasonable assumptions at the time that Assange would be extradited to a third country and his case would not be adhered to'.
He also criticised the Swedish judiciary, which had asked him to be interrogated on its territory for an alleged sexual offence, while 'Swedish justice allows this to be done by means of a videoconference which could have been carried out via the Ecuadorian embassy in London'.
Correa said there was a risk that Assange's health and mental state would be compromised.
"I have not spoken to him since he arrived at our embassy, but the ambassador has informed me that he has a slight problem with his lungs, but not a serious one," the Ecuadorian leader said.
However, there was a risk that he would suffer physical and psychological damage because he was trapped in a narrow space and could not perform physical exercises outdoors.
"That would affect the health of everyone," he added.
Correa stated that the solution to the asylum granted to Assange in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London since June was the granting of a carte blanche to allow him to travel to Ecuador, and that this was in the hands of the United Kingdom, Sweden and the legal authorities of Europe. He underlined that there had been talks with London to find a solution to the imprisoned founder of WikiLeaks.
We do not deal with human rights, we do not use that word in this case, but there have been constant discussions.
"The solution to this problem lies in the hands of the United Kingdom, Sweden and the legal authorities of Europe, because Assange's lawyer, Baltazar Garzón, is conducting a series of proceedings in various European courts," he said.
'And if Britain gives this carte blanche tomorrow, I think that's it. '
And if Sweden interrogated Mr Assange in the Ecuadorian embassy in London or via Skype, as Swedish law allows and has done in other cases, the problem is over.
Correa took the opportunity to affirm himself as a defender of press freedom, saying that what he does not tolerate is "the mediocrity, evil intent, and lies that invalidate freedom of expression."
"The greatest enemies of press freedom are not evil and perverse politicians, but bad journalists who seek and extort for profit," he said.
In this sense, he congratulated himself on the fact that Ecuador is no longer dominated by such journalists "nor by bankers or hegemonic and petty-bourgeois countries," and anticipated that if re-elected, he would "deepen the revolution in order to continue on the right path."
Correa also supported the decision to maintain the veto over Paraguay in Unasur at least until its next elections, arguing that the body "must remain tough and not allow opportunism and a coup d'etat disguised as legal," because it "destroyed the legitimacy of democracy in Paraguay."
The President of Ecuador also believes that the desire of his Colombian counterpart, Juan Manuel Santos, to negotiate with Nicaragua the maritime borders between the two countries, now and following the judgment of the International Court of Justice in The Hague, which favored the maritime sovereignty of Nicaragua, is "absolutely justified."
At present, this judgment is not being implemented.
It is a problem between a South American state and a Central American state.
Conflicts are unavoidable, but they must be overcome in the pursuit of a common path.
They need to be dealt with comprehensively so that they can be overcome and look ahead.
Likewise, he was confident that the maritime border disputes between Peru and Chile would be resolved in the same court, saying that "it is right for Latin America to appeal to international authorities if both countries undertake to accept the judgment, even if it is very harsh."
On the possibility of standing as a candidate for the next presidential elections in Ecuador in order to win his third consecutive term, he said that he sees this possibility "with a lot of optimism and joy, although it is sometimes very difficult."
Correa said that if he lost the February 2013 election, he would retire from politics.
Personally, I have never been interested in power, but in such unjust circumstances as in Ecuador, this socio-economic poverty can only be corrected by political power.
"My political movement had a belief that it was me who guaranteed this likely victory, so I have to shoulder that responsibility," he said.
If I win, it would be my last term as president, after which I retire from public life.
This also applies if we lose.
"It's decided," he said.
Correa also referred to the treatment of Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez's health problems in Cuba.
I have just spoken to the Vice-President of Venezuela, Nicolás Maduro, who told me that he had gone there for planned, routine treatment and that he was expected to be able to go back to Cuba after the election campaign.
"It certainly does not mean a relapse in President Chávez's health," he said.
The Ecuadorian Head of State attended today in Lima the 6th Summit of Heads of State and Government of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur), which ended with a call for greater regional integration in order to ensure sustainable progress, equality and security.
Cause of death due to AIDS is now too late detection
Fabrizio was 21 years old when he was confirmed as HIV positive.
"It was like a bomb went off," he says of the moment he received the diagnosis, which the doctor "tried to mitigate" with no apparent success.
He hid it from his family.
He decided to take care of his illness on his own and began to find out about it; and he did so with such dedication that he just celebrated his 43rd birthday.
He is undoubtedly one of the oldest patients in the HIV Unit of the Hospital Civil de Guadalajara (HCG), where he arrived after several fights in 1994.
Fabrizio has been living with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) for 22 years, which was hard to imagine in the early 1990s, when there were many doubts, few treatment options and more stigmata.
At the time, even the director of an IMSS clinic avoided saying goodbye "because it led to a dead end."
Back then, AIDS was synonymous with death.
Today it is possible to survive this syndrome also with quality of life.
However, there are still many people in the clinic who are unaware of their illness, who have already been harmed by the virus and whose immune systems have been depleted, and who are victims of opportunistic infections.
Thirty-one years after the appearance of AIDS in the world, i.e. after the first reported cases, "the great success today means that the survival of a patient who starts treatment on time and the survival of the general population are exactly the same," said Jaime Andrade Villanueva, head of the HIV Unit of the HCG, saying that this information was supported by a prestigious scientific publication in April this year.
Infectious Diseases and HIV / AIDS specialist Andrade Villanueva commented that since 2008, scientists have concluded that AIDS is not a death sentence, but that years of survival and quality of life depend on the degree of damage to people's immune systems at the start of treatment, and that those who are not addicted to drugs have a greater chance: up to 30 years at a count of 200 CD4 and 50 years at a count of 500 CD4.
Simply put, the above means that anyone diagnosed HIV-positive at the age of 25 "can easily live to 75 as long as they are under control," the expert said.
To properly gauge this progress, it is important to remember that Mexicans today have an average life expectancy of 76 years.
Even if mortality has decreased significantly in recent years (in Mexico, the number of people dying from AIDS has decreased from 6,678 cases in 2007 to 4,862 in 2011 (ONUSIDA annual report)), it is true that 60% of the patients recorded in the national database have died since the appearance of AIDS.
In Jalisco alone, 255 people died in 2011, and by May of this year, 187 had already died, although there is assurance that there has been universal access to antiretroviral drugs since 2005.
So why are people still dying from it?
- In my opinion, the problem is not access to treatment.
This is my opinion, and so is our hospital.
At least for the past 12 years, we have not had any problems with the supply of medicines. The problem is that people come in a very advanced state because they do not know their state of infection, that is, in the very late stages of the disease.
He makes a strong point: "Nine out of ten patients come to us if they already have an accompanying infection. In order to influence global mortality, earlier diagnoses are needed, which is why massive detection tests must be offered to all those who need it."
This proposal is approved by the professionals and officials of the Consejo Estatal de Prevención del Sida en Jalisco (Coesida) (National Committee for AIDS Prevention in Jalisco), as well as by patients such as Fabrizio, who had his test done in a private laboratory, for the sole reason that it was made by a friend of his who, despite his young age, was already in the AIDS phase and even had Kaposi sarcoma (a cancerous tumour), which is one of the usual complications.
Everything is different when you know you have AIDS.
Some think they are going to die and don't want to hear anything.
"If I have to die, I'd rather burst three times," they say in my case.
The change has been to improve, I eat well, exercise and take medication.
Today, all his parents know is that he had cancer.
I live a normal life, like everyone else.
"I work, I do a lot, I have an active but responsible sex life, I take care of my health and that of the other person," says Fabrizio, who agreed to share his intimate details with MILENIO JALISCO in order to animate with his testimony those who are afraid today in the context of World AIDS Day.
They should take the test if they are in the risk group. The earlier they know if they are HIV positive, the better, and if they already know the diagnosis, they should learn how to live responsibly like all people.
His message is a summary of the fight against AIDS in 2012.
Condoms behind the counter
There are huge gaps between health programs and ordinary citizens, explains Ricardo Salazar, a journalist from Guadalajara who has taken up the cause of HIV.
And the most important thing is prevention.
In the designated places, "the distribution of condoms has actually been increased; in the past they were given individually, now they give us packages of a hundred, which is good, but there are still people who do not have access to a condom," he said.
Young people are at risk for new infections.
"What do you need them for?" is a common mocking question posed by social workers, guidance staff in schools, pharmacy workers and health workers, to which young people do not want to be exposed, the correspondent asserted.
He proposed to reorient this inefficient distribution; the condoms should not only be located behind the counter, but in dispensing devices in public toilets of facilities frequently visited by young people.
It is not to promote promiscuity.
They will not be paid for the beer and the motel, as Governor Emilio Gonzalez responded to a question about whether condoms would be distributed under his administration.
"Sexuality doesn't look like that; it's best to bring condoms closer to those who are already engaged in sexual activity," he said.
Key data from Jalisco
There are 13,435 cumulative cases (12,158 AIDS and 1,317 HIV).
Nationally, the state ranks 4th in new and cumulative AIDS cases, and 13th in HIV.
92% of cases occur through sexual intercourse, 6% through the blood and 2% perinatal.
It is estimated that 50,000 people live with HIV because for every registered case there are 4 or 5 people who do not know.
After the United States Court of Appeals upheld a ruling that did not recognise the restructuring of the liabilities of the Vitro Group, achieved through a trade exchange in Mexico, an ominous precedent is being set for any national company with subsidiaries in the neighbouring country that has payment problems.
So one could say that the procedures for the survival of the companies that Mexican law allows do not apply in the land of stars and stripes, contrary to international agreements.
In practice, the recognition of the judgment by Judge Harlin Hale in the Bancarrotas Court for the Northern District of Texas on 15 June means that Mexican companies are helpless in the face of the seizure of their property across the Bravo River.
However, the decision opens the door for the largest glass manufacturer in Mexico to go to the United States Supreme Court for three inconsistencies.
While the judge in the case points out that creditors must be subject to United States bankruptcy law, the New Orleans-based Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals says the main case is the trade dispute handled in Mexico.
The first point would mean that international cooperation in cases of insolvency of companies with a transnational profile is not known.
In fact, the United Nations Model Law for the Unification of International Trade Law was created for this purpose, with the American Law Institute as arbitrator.
Secondly, the judgment states that without the votes of the companies, after recognition of the liabilities in the bankruptcy estate held by the subsidiaries of Vitro with their parent company, the majority required for the restructuring of the liabilities would not have been achieved.
However, Mexican law recognizes this possibility.
In fact, Vitro is not the first case where this scheme has been approved.
There are half a dozen examples, including Agremex and Comercial Mexicana, whose liabilities among companies in the group have been confirmed by the Instituto Federal de Concursos Mercantiles.
It is also true that, after subtracting the votes of the branches, the creditors of Vitro, the creditors who brought proceedings against Vitro in the United States courts, i.e. vulture funds such as Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergencia, Elliot Internacional and Liverpool Limited, would not have achieved a majority.
The vote would have been 45 percent against 37 percent.
This is not taken into account by the Court of Appeal.
On the other hand, Vitro is to blame for its difficult situation from 2008 onwards in the context of the great economic crisis in the United States, which struck the country.
That is why the González Sada family is appealing to the same Court of Appeal to have the vote taken in plenary, that is, by all the judges, because only three of them voted.
If this is not granted, the Cerciorare appeal will be lodged, requesting that the case be reviewed by a higher court, in this case the United States Supreme Court.
The gravity of this case is that the Court left aside a document sent by the Government of Mexico under the Figura amicus curiae (friend of the Court), which describes the procedure carried out by Vitro under the Trade Commodities Act, and which points out that it had strictly adhered to the agreements signed by both countries in order to comply with Chapter 15 of the United States Bankruptcy Code.
It is also pointed out that the country has submitted to the principles of the United Nations Commission on International Trade, i.e. the rules laid down in the case of cross-border insolvency, which guarantee equality between debtors and creditors.
Double-banded carambola: a blow for vitro and for the country.
General Balance Sheet
The Asociación Sindical de Pilotos Aviadores (Pilots "Union) has finally made progress after several months of inaction by the Mexican air transport unions against the former owner Gastón Azcárraga Andrade, who is accused of fraudulent management.
The petition, led by Carlos Díaz Chávez Morineau, has now brought criminal proceedings against the National Banking and Securities Commission, accusing it of obstruction of justice.
Subsequently, the supervisory authority systematically refused to inform the head office of the Republic of a transaction carried out by the Entrepreneur to withdraw 198 million pesos from the trust account F / 589 of Bank IXE in the name of Mexicana de Aviación.
These funds were used to acquire shares in the Administradora Profesional de Hoteles (Professional Hotel Management).
As you know, Azcárraga Andrade is the main shareholder in the Posadas hotel chain.
Dragon Mart is surrounded
At a meeting at the weekend at a University of the Caribbean forum, a group of national and foreign environmentalists, academics, entrepreneurs and general members of civil society decided to create a broad front to oppose the opening of China's Dragon Mart in Cancun.
As you know, we are talking about a huge sales and distribution centre in Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean with products from the country beyond the Wall, supplemented by a residential area for the employees of 150 companies.
In advance, the Canacintra (the National Chamber of Manufacturing Industry) has managed to unite the governors of the south-east to oppose the monumental structure, which has partially destroyed protected areas and is the mother of all threats to industry.
ACTA is dead
Because the government failed to comply with a Senate request to explain the conditions and circumstances under which the Mexican ambassador to Japan signed the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement, known as ACTA, the matter has already been archived, according to the Mexican Intellectual Property Institute.
As you know, these measures were taken despite the fact that the Senate had not considered the possibility because it considered them to be a violation of freedom of expression on social networks.
Homex
In an effort to pay down long-term liabilities without affecting short-term liabilities, the construction company Homex is putting on the market more than 500 million pesos in stock certificates.
The issue is the first of four equal issues that promise to pay interest every 28 days.
Founding of Competival
Composed of NYCE, e-Quálity and Kernet, leading companies in the field of information technology, a group of companies called Competival was founded with the aim of providing services to software clusters in Central and South America.
The corresponding investment exceeds $1.5 billion.
Héctor "Hetin" Reyes: "Basketball was my life"
The globetrotter of basketball, Héctor "Hetin" Reyes, was connected to basketball for more than 60 years and travelled all over the world.
Few in Puerto Rico have such a large intellectual collection of the history of the country's basketball as Héctor "Hetin" Reyes.
Before he was confined to a wheelchair by a stroke in 2008, Rexes was part of the sport for 6 years, be it as a lower-level player, a player of the first national league, a representative and leader in the BSN with the Vaqueros de Bayamón or president of the basketball federation.
"All my life, I've put on a lot of hats in basketball, even several at the same time, when I was president of BSN, general manager of the national team and president of the federation in the 1990s," Reyes recalled during a visit by Primera Hora to his home in Bayamón, where he lives with Isabel, his faithful wife for more than 50 years.
"Basketball was my life."
Reyes is not exaggerating with this statement.
The walls of his house are almost all decorated with photos and memories of his long career and bear witness to them.
Bayamón in the heart
The most emotional memories are those that recall his time with the Vaqueros from the mid-1950s as a player until 1982, when he celebrated his 15th anniversary as co-manager or managing director of the club.
"These were my best years, which I enjoyed the most, because I was allowed to be part of eight championships of the Vaqueros since 1967, be it as general manager, co-manager or coach.
There were many fulfilling years, including the five championships in succession from 1971 to 1975.
And then I said goodbye with a championship in 1981, the year of Jerome Mincy's debut on BSN.
Then "Cuco" took over from Ortiz, who was a very good manager, "Reyes said.
I remember Gene Bartow, who worked here as a coach and was employed at the University of Alabama (Birmingham), telling me: "I have a very strong, 6ft 2in player.
Do you want him? "
And that was the beginning of Mincy, one of the best players Puerto Rico ever had.
Bartow then recommended free-throw specialist Raymond Gausse, who became a naturalized citizen and was one of our best throwers.
I remember him saying that if Mincy had made one championship possible for Bayamon, Gausse would have made another.
The championship of the Vaqueros with Gausse was granted to him, but already from a distance, because he was already at the top of the federation in 1988.
At that time, he preferred to enjoy his enforcements and those of Mincy in the national team.
I remember the first time we won against the USA at the pre-Olympic tournament in Mexico.
Then came the 1990 World Cup, where we finished fourth, which should have been bronze had it not been for that Canadian referee who made us repeat the final move for the second time, Reyes said.
Was that group at the 1990 World Cup the best national team you've ever seen?
She is one of the best, like the one who won against the Dream Team at the 2004 Olympics.
My favorite, however, is the team from the 1991 Pan-American Games in Cuba, where we won gold and put up a fight against the USA team, just as they did when they won bronze against us at the World Championships.
Not only Mincy, Gausse, Ramon Rivas, Fico López and "Piculín" (Ortiz) were back on the team, but also the young players (Javier) "Toñito" Colón and James Carter, the brothers León (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario "Quixote" Morales, who could not be there in 1990 because of a knee injury.
One team that was perhaps not the best in terms of personalities, but with which we won a gold medal and which gave us great pleasure, was that of the pre-Olympic tournament in Neuquén, Argentina in 1995.
With players like "Canito" Nieves, Pablo Alicea and the young Rolando Hourruitiner replacing the suspended players because of the events at the Pan American Games in Mar del Plata, we won the gold medal against all odds.
Who was Puerto Rico's best player?
That was no doubt Piculín Ortiz.
His numbers at international tournament level are impressive.
No one in Puerto Rico has dominated at this level like Piculín.
And that is without considering his career in the different leagues he played in.
Who was the best Puerto Rican coach?
This is a difficult question.
We had a number of good coaches like Julio Toro, Flor Meléndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Armandito Torres.
Of the boys, I like Leo Arill's work.
What do you think is the best you have achieved in the FA?
I was part of the most successful era of the national team from 1988 to 1995, which included the BSN in the early 1990s up to 17 teams in one season.
What else do you have to do?
There are things I would have introduced, such as the regionalisation of the lower categories.
That the boys in Ponce, for example, only play in their area and only come up against teams from other corners of the island in the national playoffs.
Today, children make unnecessary trips and play.
At least I can see the result of the mandatory training and courses for coaches, table officials and referees.
I'm proud of that.
What are you doing today?
I like to listen to music, watch videos of music from my time on YouTube, enjoy my grandchildren and now and then I go to a basketball game.
And of course I enjoy the company of my wife Isabel, who has always been by my side.
Larry Hagman is dead
Larry Hagman was born on September 21, 1931 in Forth Worth, Texas, and became world famous for his role as John Ross Ewing, better known as "J.R." in the television series "Dallas," where he played a ruthless, insidious and manipulative businessman.
Larry Hagman, whose role as oil magnate J.R. Ewing in the television series "Dallas" became a symbol of 1980s greed, has died.
He was 81.
Hagman, who returned this year as J.R. in a new season of "Dallas," died Friday afternoon of cancer complications, according to a family press release to The Associated Press from Warner Bros., producer of "Dallas."
"Larry was back in his beloved hometown of Dallas, playing the iconic role he loved most," the family said.
Larry's family and closest friends were with him in Dallas for the Thanksgiving Day celebrations.
Linda Gray, who played his wife in the original and subsequent series, was with Hagman when he died at a Dallas hospital, her publicist Jeffrey Lane said.
He brought joy to all who knew him.
He was creative, generous, funny, funny, loving and talented and I will miss him greatly.
"He was an original person and lived life to the fullest," Gray said in a statement.
Hagman was diagnosed with cirrhosis of the liver in 1992, and he admitted drinking heavily for years.
In 1995, he was diagnosed with a malignant tumour in his liver and underwent a transplant.
In the years before "Dallas," Hagman became known on television as a nice guy from 1965 to 1970 with NBC's sitcom "Jeannie."
There he played the astronaut Tony Nelson, whose life is turned upside down when he meets an attractive "jinn" (played by Barbara Eden) who will live at his home.
He also starred in two short-lived comedies, "The Good Life" (NBC, 1971-72) and "Here We Go Again" (ABC, 1973).
His feature films included critically acclaimed roles in "The Group," "Harry and Tonto" and "Primary Colors."
But it was his masterful interpretation of the charmingly odious J.R. that made Hagman a superstar.
CBS 'dramatic series about the Ewing clan and other characters in its vicinity aired from April 1978 to May 1991.
The advertising slogan "Who shot J.R.?," intended to create anticipation for an emotional episode in which Hagmann's character was nearly killed, led to international speculation and millions of dollars were wagered in betting houses.
The show reached a record audience at the time.
When the answer was announced in a chapter in November 1990, it was watched by an average of 41 million viewers, turning "Dallas" into the second most-watched entertainment program since the end of "MASH" in 1983, which had 50 million viewers.
It was Kristin, J.R. "s sister-in-law (played by Mary Crosby) who had shot.
J.R. had impregnated her and threatened to portray her as a prostitute if she did not leave town. However, others also had reasons to want to see him dead.
Hagman interpreted the role of Ewing as a corrupt, voracious man with a charismatic smile: a devious businessman and unfaithful husband who sought to have his alcoholic wife, Sue Ellen (Linda Gray), admitted to hospital.
"I know what's on J.R." s gravestone, "Hagman said in 1988.
It should read: "Here rests the honourable citizen J.R. Ewing."
This is the only business he hasn't won.
Victoria Principal, who co-starred in the original series, remembered Hagman as a "tremendous personality on and off screen" on Friday.
He is unforgettable and irreplaceable to millions of worshippers around the world and remains in our hearts for those of us who were fortunate enough to know and love him.
Ten episodes of the new edition of "Dallas" aired a few months ago with great success on the television channel TNT.
Filming of five chapters for the second season had been completed, and a sixth chapter was being filmed, the station said.
There was no immediate explanation from Warner or TNT about how Hagmann's loss would be handled on the show.
Born in Fort Worth, Texas, he was the son of actress and singer Mary Martin, who played classical works such as "South Pacific" and "Peter Pan."
Martin was still a teenager when she got Larry during her marriage to attorney Ben Hagman.
He tried his luck on the stage in New York at the beginning of the 50s, afterwards he served in the Air Force in England from 1952 to 1956.
There he met and married the young designer Maj Axelsson.
The couple had two children, Preston and Heidi, and they lived for a long time in the Californian town of Malibu, where many celebrities reside.
In 2001, he titled his memoir "Hello Darlin: Tall (and Absolutely True) Tales About My Life."
"I didn't write anything that I thought would harm or in any way affect anyone," he told The Associated Press at the time.
After the liver transplant, he lobbied for liver donations and volunteered at a hospital to help anxious patients.
"I advise them, I encourage them, I meet them when their surgeries are imminent and after," he said in 1996.
I want to give them some comfort, like "don't worry, it's a bit uncomfortable the first time, but you'll be fine."
He also campaigned against smoking and took part in several campaigns.
Beginning of the course studying the "end of the world"
Each week, students explore apocalyptic themes such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and germs, and global warming.
Every semester, when the professor of religion decided to give a course on the end of the world, he knew that he had an irresistible fish hook: the end of the Mayan calendar's "long recount" on December 21, which many people believed meant the end of the world.
But Charmé had no idea what to expect in the next two months: destructive Hurricane Sandy, which some have called "Deudarmaggedon," and a growing conflict involving Israel, the place where Christian theorists believe the Apocalypse will begin.
"I didn't realize this was going to be the most apocalyptic semester ever," Charmé told students at Rutgers-Camden University in New Jersey this week.
If someone analyses what has happened in the world today, as if we were thirty days away from it, that would be a really good period.
And he reminds us that the bad is good for those with an apocalyptic mentality.
And he is not the only professor to offer courses on the "end of the world" this semester, which was supposed to be the last in history.
In Temple, Associate Professor Barry Vacker gives the course "Media, Culture and the End of the World."
Each week, students explore apocalyptic themes such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and germs, and global warming.
"We're analyzing why these ideas spread over time," he said, as well as the way hypothetical scenarios are offered that lead to certain human behavior.
For example, if nuclear material ends up in the hands of terrorists, war could break out.
This month, the students analyzed films with apocalyptic content and examined how they compare to real life.
"I was trying to inform students about what is possible, probable, credible and impossible," Vacker said.
On the University of Pennsylvania's main campus, Latin American history professor Matthew Restall and his colleague Amara Solari, an associate professor of art history and anthropology, have formed a team to offer a course simply called "The End of the World."
"We don't start 2012 so we always have the option to reset the course in case the world doesn't end," Restall said.
Despite the "impending doom," students must study, create projects, and take final exams.
At Penn State, the final exam is held on the eve of the apocalypse, leaving students with no option but to "keep working until the night the world supposedly ends," Restall said.
The courses were very popular.
"There were no more places in two hours," Restall said of his course for high-average students, which filled up with 35 students.
Weeks before the start of the semester, we received emails from students asking if there were still places available.
For their part, the students assure that the course is among the most interesting.
"It's fascinating to see what people do to comfort themselves," said Bridgid Robinson, a 23-year-old Rutgers-Camden student of religion and sociology from Haddonfield, New Jersey.
The apocalyptic sectarian or religious mentality is actually only a question of consolation or lack thereof.
25-year-old psychology and nursing student Will Wekesa says he has seen all the apocalyptic films.
"I've never heard of a class teaching this," he said.
I'm enjoying it.
But none of the students surveyed - least of all a professor - said they believed in the final date of December 21.
"Our first project dealt with Mayan prophecy, and in some ways we discredited it," said Julie Zeglen, a 21-year-old Temple student from West Chester last year.
The Mayans never predicted the end of the world; it's just a key point in the calendar, Restall said.
However, he notes that there is an apocalyptic fear in Western society that dates back several centuries, when people responded to changes in their environment by predicting the end of the world.
The internet has heightened this speculation.
"Elsewhere, people don't think like that," he says.
This is mainly the case in the English-speaking world.
Joseph Dougherty, a religion professor at La Salle University who is teaching in the Philippines this year, is quick to respond when asked if he knew of a "end of the world" course there.
"The Philippines does not participate in the end of the world," he wrote, alluding to an exception by a higher authority.
We have a pardon from the Pope.
Restall pointed out that over the years many days have been spoken of the Last Judgment, and said that if nothing happens on December 21st, "people immediately think of a new date" or philosophize that December 21st is the beginning of a seven-year period after which the end of the world will come.
Students and professors take this date lightly.
Several said they wanted to go out to celebrate "the end of the world."
"Maybe I'll call some friends so we can laugh together," said Samira Ford, a 20-year-old communications student.
