Barack Obama becomes the fourth US President to receive the Nobel Peace Prize
American President Barack Obama arrives in Oslo, Norway, for 26 hours to receive the Nobel Peace Prize, the fourth US president in history to do so.
He also receives the diploma, medal and a check for $1.4 million for his extraordinary efforts to intensify world diplomacy and cooperation among nations.
The White House chief is arriving in the Nordic capital tomorrow with his wife Michelle and will be busy all the time.
He first visited the Nobel Institute, where he met for the first time with the five members of the committee who elected him in October from among 172 people and 33 organisations.
The President and the President-in-Office will then meet with King Harald V and Queen Sonja of Norway.
The visit will culminate in the ceremony in the afternoon, when Obama will receive the prestigious award.
He's the fourth U.S. president to receive the award, but only the third to receive it while in office.
The White House has announced that Obama will be speaking about the war in Afghanistan when he accepts the award.
The President does not want to avoid this issue because he knows that he is taking the prize as a President who is currently waging war in two countries.
The war effort was reinforced by the deployment of additional troops to Afghanistan a few days ago, as none of his critics fail to point out.
At the ceremony, Obama also received the Gold Medal, the diploma and the cheque for ten million Swedish kronor (about 24 million Czech crowns).
He intends to donate the money to charity, but has not yet decided on a specific charitable work.
The programme then includes a banquet with the President and his wife, attended by the King and Queen of Norway, the Prime Minister and 250 other invited guests.
Obama was very reluctant to the award from the beginning.
He mentioned, for example, that he felt that he did not fully deserve the prize.
He also repeated several times that the prize was not just for him but for all those who shared his values.
Immediately after the announcement, he said that this was for him a "call to action".
Conservationist accused of blackmail
The Leitmeritz police accused the chairman of the citizens' association "Naturschutzgemeinschaft Leitmeritz" of blackmail.
In several cases, he lodged appeals against some construction cases last year, demanding money from investors in his favour in return for the withdrawal of his appeals, said the chief police spokeswoman, Alena Romova.
The chairman of the Leitmeritz Nature Conservation Association is Lubomir Studnicka.
Now he's in custody and facing a prison sentence of up to three years.
The sorting containers in Brno don't smell good
In Prague people can sort the beverage packages, in the southern Moravian villages one can find the sorting containers again at every step.
What about Brno?
There you would have to set aside a few minutes to find the appropriate garbage cans.
I do not want to say that the waste separation in Brno does not work at all.
But it seems to me that the Council is not sufficiently concerned about this problem, even though we are the second largest city in the Republic.
Brünn is in the waste separation race in the Jungle League, not only because we as citizens are only allowed to throw paper, glass and plastics into the sorting containers here, but above all because of the number of waste cans for such waste.
Did they ever try to dispose of the PET bottles in a collection basket at the center?
It's an art, and it takes time and nerves.
The only place I've found so far is the ant field opposite the affected goose.
I do not want Mr Onderka and his colleagues to be offended, but that seems to me to be far too little.
Except that the waste separation is not a honeycomb in other parts either.
A whole bunch of my friends don't even sort the garbage.
Out of laziness.
They're too far away from the garbage cans.
I'm not surprised.
I offered to dispose of some glass and plastic bottles after the party.
But I didn't see any paint cans in sight on Konicova Street.
Luckily, I was in the right place when I was driving the tram.
But the garbage almost ran over.
This is still the center of Brno, representing the whole city, isn't it?!
However, ecology and any kind of aesthetics probably leaves the Brunners socialists cold.
They'd rather buy the city a hockey league that brings shame to the entire republic than buy a few more tons of trash and offer to sort through more raw materials for a cleaner fountain.
I'm glad I was able to confirm my assumption with official statistics after searching the Internet for a while.
According to the data of the EKO-KOM society, Brno is really the worst in the entire district of South Moravia.
The Paroubek budget has cut off the money for pensions and sickness benefits
After the Left Party gave more money to farmers and civil servants, despite the government's opinion, there is no money in the budget for pensions, sickness benefits and building savings.
But neither for the sovereign interest or for the international court case.
This is causing even more problems for those who will be in government in the second half of next year, says Finance Minister Eduard Janota.
When the Social Democrats and the Communists imposed the salary increase for some groups, they expected the government to borrow the money for sensitive expenses, pensions or sickness benefits. "This is just a postponement of the problems for the future, mining", says Janota.
Loans pay increasingly high interest rates, and eventually the money must be repaid.
Too many to choose from, the treasury is empty.
If social benefits or government expenditure are not reduced, the tax must be increased.
For all those who were given more money by the Left Party: the fire brigade, the teachers, the farmers.
And later on, for their children.
The pension or the sickness benefit, 1.8 billion disappeared from their account, people do not have to be afraid, they get this money.
But at the price that the state owes itself even more - next year the state treasury will not only be short 163 billion, but much more.
Despite the efforts of Minister Janota, the debt will continue to grow at an ever increasing rate, and with it the costs and interest.
The government will need the money to compensate, and then it will no longer be enough to raise the VAT just a little or to cut the maternity allowance as the government did in its counter-deficit package.
Because of the devolution of funds in favour of certain popular groups, next year we will also be short of five billion for the expansion of the motorways and railways.
The main part of the project is the competition-winning section, which can no longer be redesigned and may be cheaper.
At most, it is not free.
The Commission has also proposed that the European Parliament should be given the right to vote on the Commission's proposal.
The CSSD has proposed to solve the outflow of money in a Solomonic manner - it attacks the CEZ share dividends, in which the State is the majority owner, and from these the money is then distributed to the Transport Fund.
The problem is that the amount of the dividend is never certain and it is by no means an infinite source.
Last year, the CEZ paid 18 billion into the budget.
The dividend is used to pay the environmental damage liquidation payments every year, to replenish the pension account and to serve as a reserve for the planned pension reform.
This trick also raises the real budget deficit to 5.7 percent of GDP, according to EU rules.
But the carnival of revolutions does not end there.
Almost three billion dollars was cut from the budget for various compensations for victims of communism and crime or for the cost of litigation, even for the construction budget cuts.
Whether the state can manage without this money is not certain.
It's all a gamble.
If we lose an international court case, we will have to pay for it anyway, Janota explains.
The minister then has to save the money internally or, in the worst case, attack the government budget reserve.
The two billion dollar 'state treasury' project, which is already underway, is also short 100 million, and it is intended to enable online monitoring of what individual authorities spend money on.
The first stage starts in January.
The EU has already taken action to combat the spread of HIV/AIDS in the EU, and the EU has also taken action to combat the spread of HIV/AIDS in the EU.
Your next smartphone will run on two operating systems
Americans expect a future with a mobile phone on which the user can switch between different operating systems by pressing a single button.
The plans presented look promising.
All you have to do is press a button, and Windows Mobile will be Android in seconds.
This is precisely the possibility which the American company VMware, which is mainly concerned with the development of virtual software for computers, is proposing.
We're going to allow you to run two user profiles on your phone at the same time.
You can switch between these, you can separate these into two profiles, home and work.
Both will work in parallel, Srinivas Krishnamurti of VMware said in an interview with Computerworld magazine.
It was presented in November last year and was first shown a few days ago.
It's going to hit the market in 2012.
The virtualization of smartphones is not fiction.
VMware has already successfully demonstrated to journalists the smartphone test sample with two operating systems.
One was a modified Nokia N800 with 128 MB of RAM, running both Windows Mobile and Android.
The development of new technology for mobile phones is in full swing.
VMware is now working with European and American operators to virtualize smartphones and customers should have the devices by 2012.
Snow shortage in the mountains torments hotel owners
The snow-free slopes are not just a delight to the inhabitants of the Giant Mountains.
The lack of snow also discourages people from booking skiing stays in hotels and guesthouses.
That's why in the Giant Mountains you can still get free rooms for all winter terms including Christmas and New Year's Eve.
Our pages are frequently visited.
People go through the quotes, they check the prices, but now they're afraid to make a binding order.
And when they call us, they immediately ask whether we think this year's Christmas will be on snow or "on mud", said the operator of the Spindl.info information portal, Martin Jandura.
If you want to spend New Year's Eve in the spindle mill exactly as you want, you should not hesitate to order.
If you prefer to save money and the quality of your stay is secondary, you can try to wait a few days.
The Spindelmühle hotel owners are now offering mostly week-long stays for New Year's Day.
I think they'll try to sell it for a while, but then they'll have to give in and accept shorter times.
And then the available rooms will quickly dwindle, Jandura estimated.
Free beds on all winter holidays are always offered by the Ingtours travel agency in Vrchlabi.
We are now mainly interested in the Christmas week, which is not yet sold out.
In our offer, about half the seats are still available.
"We have already prepared some cheaper Christmas holidays for the last moment", said Ingtours director Petr Schiefert.
The Vrchlabi travel agency can still offer New Year's Eve in the Giant Mountains, but there are fewer free places here.
The first fourteen days of February are also selling well, the rest of the winter terms are sold on average.
This year, the lack of snow in the Giant Mountains has also had a negative impact on the interest in winter holidays.
People are waiting to see if it's going to snow.
Nobody wants to spend the end of the year in the mountains without snow.
If the snow covers the slopes within a week, the Christmas sale will be sold out, says Schiefer.
On the contrary, and a little better than last year, we're able to fill the rooms at the Hotel Horizont in Pecpod Snezkou.
We're about five percent better than last year.
We only have a few rooms open for New Year's and Christmas.
There is a great deal of interest in Polish holidays in January, and in February business will be good, said the director of the best Pec hotel, Karel Rada.
The Omnia Hotel in the central car park in Janske Lazne is also 80% occupied for the New Year's Eve stay.
But at Christmas, half the beds in the newest hotel in Janske Lazne will still be empty.
The Commission has already made a number of proposals for the introduction of a new system of direct payments.
February has been a bit weaker, but as soon as the snow comes, the interest in stays in the Giant Mountains will certainly increase, said Omnia Hotel Director Erik Sporysch.
The owners of the Giant Mountain hotels are waiting for a major snow cover.
Thursday should cool off, and if there's any precipitation, it should be snow on the mountains.
But after that, it should warm again, Jiri Jakubsky from the Czech weather service in Hradec Kralove informed.
USA: Repetition is the mother of wisdom
It is almost comical how Barack Obama, the president with the reputation of being the smartest, is repeating the strategy of his predecessor on the Afghan issue, whom he himself considered the dumbest.
When he finally sweated out his long-awaited Afghanistan doctrine, it turned out that he had copied it over the copy paper from the Bush-Iraq scenario three years earlier.
Not only does he use the phrase "just like Iraq" several times in the text itself, he even used the name of the Bush declaration of January 2007 as the name of his own declaration: "New Way Forward", without hesitation.
The Commission has also been working on the drafting of a new European strategy for the fight against drugs, which will be presented to the European Parliament in the spring.
The following months, however, showed that the Bush strategy, based on recommendations from the military, was the only one possible and very successful in that it is no longer mentioned in the news at all.
Bush's reputation was not improved by this, because, objectively, he left his successor with a much more grateful starting situation than could have been expected.
In Afghanistan, Barack Obama is hoping for a repeat of the miracle.
The military has again asked for more troops, especially the commander-in-chief of the Afghanistan operation, General Stanley McCristal, who, despite his habit of subordination, harshly criticized the stagnant White House guards.
He called for 40,000 troops to turn the tide.
The president hesitated for three months, but couldn't think of a better idea, and so he cheated the general out of 10,000 soldiers.
He pressed Europe to commit another 5,000, although he himself had originally expected at least 10,000.
The most problematic part of the Obama strategy is his plan to withdraw troops from Afghanistan in 18 months and complete the process in three years, and the whole Obama doctrine leaves more questions than answers.
Some doubt that the halving of the stockpile will have the same effect as the action in Iraq.
Even in spite of the fratricidal war of the last few years, Iraqi society is relatively well structured, its leaders respect the values.
The Afghan situation is characterized by the contraindication that no one can be trusted and no agreements are kept.
Under these conditions, it is difficult to prepare the Afghan security forces, who are used to changing their minds every day.
The political institutions, even if they are formally correctly established, remain only facades behind which the patriarchal tribal relations will continue to grow.
The balancing of interests between the different ethnic groups is unusually complicated, especially because of the ambiguity of the relationships that further complicates the Pakistan and Iranian influences.
The construction of a 'state capable of acting' which is the minimalist goal of the whole operation is also very unrealistic.
The time horizon of Obama's strategy is alienated by his voluntarism
Over the past eight years, the situation in Afghanistan has only gotten worse and now it is on the verge of exploding.
To believe that the little soldiers who have broken out into the war cry of "early homecoming" are here to work a miracle, can only be a truly romantic soul, unimpressed by facts.
From a political point of view, setting a date for the withdrawal of troops is pure irresponsibility, because the Taliban will take it as an indirect admission of American defeat.
The last NATO summit showed that the willingness of Europeans to participate in the fighting in Afghanistan is running out.
The European politicians cannot and do not want to explain to their electorate how the security of Germany or Italy is linked to the war in the foothills of the Hindu Kush.
Another factor which could radically affect the situation is the development of events in Iran.
If the situation continues to deteriorate and if the increased sanctions do not have an effect on the Iranians, the United States will face a very serious question of whether the problem can be solved by the use of troops.
This question must be answered in the period in which America is moving after Obama to the victorious withdrawal from Afghanistan.
But any solution will also mean a dramatic reversal of the Afghan situation.
The only consolation for Barack Obama is the fact that there are still three years until the presidential election, and so there is still enough time for him to resort to another strategy if it turns out to be a total failure.
The managers of Goldman Sachs Bank no longer receive bonus notes in cash
The executives of the American bank Goldman Sachs will no longer receive bonus vouchers in cash this year.
This was announced by the company, which is responding to the sharp criticism of its wage practices.
A group of 30 top managers are given stock instead of cash, but they can't sell stock for five years.
In addition, the shares may be withdrawn from the managers if they act excessively risky.
Goldman Sachs is thus leading the effort to link Wall Street's bonuses to long-term performance, according to Reuters.
I believe that Wall Street is aware of the further direction it needs to go in, said Douglas Elliott, a former banker at JPMorgan.
The problem, he added, was the details.
Goldman Sachs has come under fire for setting aside nearly $17 billion in bonus money for the first three quarters of this year.
The total amount of bonuses this year is likely to exceed $20 billion, according to Reuters, even with today's announcement.
The high premium bonuses in the banking sector have become the hottest political issue in a number of countries since the financial crisis began.
Britain reported on Wednesday that it intends to impose a one-off tax of 50 percent on bankers' bonuses exceeding £25,000.
France is preparing to take similar steps.
This year, women have won the Nobel Prizes in all disciplines except physics.
A record five women have received this year's Nobel Prizes in the fields of science and literature from the hands of King Carl XVI Gustaf of Sweden in Stockholm.
In addition to the four women scientists, the German writer of Romanian origin, Herta Müller, was also among them.
The Nobel Prize in Medicine was awarded to two American biologists, Elizabeth Blackburn and Carol Greider, together with their compatriot Jack Szostak, for their research in the field of chromosomes.
The prize for chemistry was awarded to Israeli Ada Jonath and to Americans Venkatraman Ramakrishnan and Thomas Steitz for their work on the structure and function of ribosomes.
The last laureate awarded the Nobel Prize in Economics to the American Elinor Ostrom and her compatriot Oliver Williamson for their analyses of the economic report.
The only subject in which no woman won the Nobel Prize that year was physics.
The prize was awarded today to scientists Charles Kao for his research into optical fibres and George Smith and Willard Boyl for the invention of the CCD chip, which is the basis of all digital cameras, fax machines and astronomical telescopes.
Each of these laureates has received the diploma, the Nobel medals and a certificate of the prize money.
The amount of the grant is SEK 10 million in each category.
If there are several winners in each category, the prize money is divided among them.
The most awaited Nobel Peace Prize was traditionally awarded to US President Barack Obama this afternoon in Oslo.
He acknowledged the controversy of his appointment, because he is only at the beginning of his journey, and moreover, he is leading the country that is fighting two wars - in Iraq and Afghanistan.
But, in keeping with his policy, he added that wars are necessary in certain situations to achieve world peace, even if the price is high.
Minister Janota is considering resignation.
President Vaclav Klaus receives on Friday morning the Minister of Finance, Eduard Janota, who is considering his remaining in the government because he disagrees with the implementation of the state budget for the next year in the form as it was released by the Assembly of Deputies on Wednesday.
It is believed that the budget and perhaps the question of Janota remaining in the cabinet will be the topics of Friday's meeting.
Klaus is also critical of the budget.
The budget deficit is too high, he said, deepening the crisis in public finances.
The meeting was informed by the spokesman for the President, Radim Ochvat.
Janota will be negotiating with the Prime Minister Jan Fischer on Monday to decide whether he will continue to hold office.
The budget law, which is now being signed by Klaus, would have meant that the Czech Republic would run a deficit of 163 billion crowns.
The European Parliament voted on Wednesday on the Left Party's proposals for monetary reform and increased money for civil servants' salaries, social security benefits and direct farmer's wages.
The government has opposed the Social Democrats' suggestions that they should increase the budget deficit covertly.
The left party on the one hand and the government, Klaus and the right party on the other, have therefore been in a sharp internal political dispute, raising the question of the future work of the Fischer-officials cabinet, which the ODS, CSSD and Green Party agreed to form in the spring.
Critics claim that the budget as adopted by Parliament effectively liquidates the austerity package imposed by the Fischer government in the autumn, which they see as ending the state debt.
Klaus, who can sign the law on the state budget but does not have to, explained today at the breakfast discussion with the entrepreneurs that the politicians have neglected the "serious problem" that is the "untenable deficit" of public finances for a long time.
In his opinion, there is no good solution today.
The only way to improve the situation is to have a strong government, which could also be based on a wider consensus of the political parties.
ODS chairman Mirek Topolanek said the budget was terrible and the government should consider its continued existence.
ODS deputy chairman Petr Necas told the CTK that the concept of a civil servants' cabinet with the support of the CSSD, ODS and the Green Party was clearly no longer working.
In the editorial, Prime Minister Fischer described similar words as "strong statements".
The head of the CSSD, Jiri Paroubek, reacted to Topolanek's words that the budget deficit was terrible, that the previous government of Topolanek had prepared for this year, and that it exceeded 200 billion crowns.
On Wednesday, the CSSD declared the approval of the state budget for the next year a success.
The People's Party was also satisfied.
Mandela was played in the new movie by Clint Eastwood by Morgan Freeman
South Africans claim that the new Hollywood movie "Invictus: The Undefeated" shows the world much of the country, its struggles and victories despite some criticism that the lead role was played by an American actor.
The story is about sports, race relations and Nelson Mandela.
The untiring fighter against the racist system of apartheid in South Africa and its first black president, Nelson Mandela, is portrayed in his life story by the Oscar-winning American actor Morgan Freeman.
Freeman said he was asked by the ninety-one-year-old Mandela if he could play him in the Eastwood movie.
Another significant role is played by Matt Damon.
I said, "If I'm gonna play you, I have to meet you.
The 72-year-old actor, who won the award for his role in the Eastwood drama "Million Dollar Baby", has already portrayed the leader of the movement to abolish slavery, who eventually became a slave owner, a fictional US president, and God in "Evan Almighty", but rarely anyone who is still alive and as important to many people as Mandela.
The former South African statesman spent 27 years in prison for his active role in ending apartheid in South Africa.
He was released in 1990 and became president of the country for four years.
In 1993 he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.
"Invictus" is the Latin word for "undefeated", and it is also the name of a poem by the English writer William Ernest Henley, published in 1875.
The requirement was how he spoke
The film depicts a true story of Nelson Mandela joining forces with South African rugby captain Francois Pienaar to unite the country, as the new president Mandela knows that his people are still divided racially and economically after apartheid.
He believes that he can unite his people through sport, so he decides to unite the rugby players who are the world's outsiders.
Finally, the South African team will rise to the World Cup in 1995.
Freeman worked for several years to bring the Mandela story to the screen.
He had no other goal than to play the role in such a way as to bring it as close as possible to reality, Freeman said.
Of course, the biggest challenge was to speak like him.
The actor said that if he and the world politician were in the same country, he would try to meet with Mandela, have dinner with him and be behind the scenes of his speech.
The most important thing for him was to shake hands with Mandela.
I noticed that when I shake your hand, I take in your energy, it's transmitted, and I felt that I know what you're feeling, he said.
It's important to me that I've become a different person.
Matt Damon plays François Pienaar, captain of the national rugby team, in which the white players have prevailed.
The actor said he had six months to prepare for the role in the rugby world.
It was a great surprise for him when he met Pienaar for the first time in his house.
I remember when I rang the doorbell, that it opened and the first thing I said to François Pienaar in my life was: 'In the film I look much bigger.'
Despite the obvious differences in the stature of the actors compared to their actual role models, directed by Eastwood, Invictus: Undefeated has received positive reviews and is also talked about as an Oscar contender.
Daily Variety film critic Todd McCarthy summed up his assessment: "It was a very good story, very well-made".
In the movie reviews on the website rottentomatoes.com, Invictus has received 76 percent positive reviews.
A mystery over Norway solved: Russians test a missile
A strange light effect of unknown origin was observed over Norway.
The Russian Ministry of Defense only admitted yesterday that an intercontinental ballistic missile was tested near the Norwegian border.
The launch was again unsuccessful, however, and the Bulava missile, which was originally intended to be the pride of the Russian army, is slowly becoming the nightmare of the Russian generals and Prime Minister Vladimir Putin.
The Commission has also received comments from the applicants, which have not been received.
Most of the time, Bulava never started or was damaged in mid-air.
In the Russian newspapers, they're already writing about "Bulava" as a "rocket that doesn't fly".
A rocket that doesn't fly, but shines
This, the 13th attempt, started off normal.
It was only at the end of the flight that the rocket again suffered technical damage.
The engine probably exploded in the third stage of the rocket.
This time, Bulava was launched from the nuclear submarine Dmitry Donsky, which was under the waters of the White Sea.
This type of missile allows the launch from the submarine.
Therefore, it is likely that the mysterious light over the northern route caused by an unidentified flying object was actually the damaged "Bulava".
Moreover, the Norwegians have not doubted from the first moment that it is a Russian missile.
The general public has resisted this time, arguing that failure is not an absolute.
The first two stages of the missile did not fail and the accident only affected the third stage.
In the previous cases, the engines in the first stage were damaged.
Even though no test launch was without error, the Defense Department's leadership considers only six out of thirteen to be unsuccessful.
The almost fifty percent success rate therefore fills the Generalitat with optimism and so it is further claimed that the "Bulava" will one day fly without problems and will even carry up to ten hypersonic nuclear warheads with a total weight of max. 1.15 tons.
The legendary Fetisov has signed a one-year contract with CSKA Moscow at the age of 51
The legendary defenceman Vyaceslav Fetisov is 51 years old and is back in a professional ice hockey game.
The former world champion, Olympic champion and Stanley Cup winner is helping his team CSKA Moscow out of a crisis, and will likely be in the KHL's Friday duel against Petersburg.
Fetisov, who retired in 1998 at the age of 40, is currently the president of CSKA.
After Denis Kuljas' injury, we are in desperate need of another defensive player.
Fetisov has been training regularly and has agreed to support the team.
We just need to clear up some remaining formalities, the AP agency quoted the coach of the Moscow club of Sergei Nemcinov.
It's not clear if the famous hockey player's comeback will be limited to one game.
I think Fetisov is one of those who can raise the morale of other players, said Nemcinov.
If Fetisov returns to the ice, he will be the oldest Russian professional ice hockey player, according to the AP.
In the NHL, legendary forward Gordie Howe played a full season for Hartford at the age of fifty-one, and scored 15 goals and 26 assists.
The oldest of the famous Five, Fetisov, Kasatonov - Makarov, Larionov, Krutov, is one of the best and most successful ice hockey players in history.
He won two Olympic gold medals, seven world titles, and he also won the Canada Cup and the World Junior Championships.
In the second part of his career, he also collected success in the NHL, where he twice lifted the Stanley Cup over his head in the Detroit-Dress.
Since 2001 he is a member of the Ice Hockey Hall of Fame.
Hyundai has given in to the unions.
The management of the Nosovice automobile factory Hyundai agreed with the union to abolish all overtime.
The union has announced that it will strike on Monday because of the frequent overtime work.
This was confirmed by spokesman of the Hyundai Motor Company, Petr Vanek.
The management wants to agree with the union members on a Saturday shift this week.
We cannot give up our production schedule, that is a principle, that is why voluntary overtime was proposed on Saturday, December 19, on the grounds that two shifts would be worked, Vanek said.
The website Sedmicka.cz reported that the company offered a bonus of CZK 400 to employees who would work the Saturday shift.
The staff will also receive it afterwards for the Saturday shift of 28 November.
According to Vanek, the company has decided to change the motivation of the employees for the proposed overtime.
The EU has also been involved in the development of the European Union's relations with the countries of Central and Eastern Europe.
In addition, all employees on Saturday shifts are paid for their travel and lunch.
Given that the overtime was the most urgent and burning issue in terms of demands and complaints from the trade unionists who had stopped production last week, the management decided yesterday afternoon with immediate effect to cancel all overtime for the month of December, Vaněk said.
The workers at the car plant had been forced to work two extra hours after the eight-hour shift practically every day until last week.
The signature of the agreement will revoke the union's willingness to strike.
Further negotiations between the management of the automobile factory and the trade unionists are due to take place on Friday afternoon.
The union leader, Petr Kuchar, said on Wednesday that if they could agree on the fulfillment of the demands and sign a joint document, they were ready to lift the strike.
The situation at the automobile plant came to a head last week, on Wednesday, when some 400 workers went on a spontaneous strike over continuous overtime.
They also protested against the poor payment conditions and alleged harassment.
The management objected to the employees having to work overtime to meet the automobile delivery requirements.
The trade unionists also demanded in their Monday strike declaration that the employees who had interrupted production last Wednesday should not be sanctioned.
In the field of overtime, the unions are calling for overtime to be reduced to a minimum.
In addition, they demand that the fee of 5000 krones be paid this year.
The Nosovice car factory Hyundai now employs 2000 people.
The company started series production in November last year.
Until September, about 80,000 vehicles were produced here, and the current production capacity is 200,000 vehicles per year.
Czech discovery: a substance that also acts on 'steeled' HIV viruses
The team of Czech and German scientists is testing new compounds that are designed to prevent the spread of HIV viruses in the body.
The main advantage of the improved substance is that it also works on viruses that are already drug resistant.
This outweighs the disadvantage that the compound is not as potent against common virus variants as one of the existing drugs.
The AIDS disease is not curable yet.
But for patients, the combination of drugs can prolong life and prevent the multiplication of HIV viruses in the body.
But taking them is accompanied by a whole host of side effects.
Incomplete suppression of viral replication also results in the development of so-called resistant viruses against which no drugs are effective.
The work of experts from three institutes of the Academy of Sciences CR, the VSCHT (High School of Chemical Technology) Prague and the University of Heidelberg opens the way to deal with virus resistance.
They have shown that the substances called metallocarbons act on the protein responsible for the reproduction of the HIV virus.
The metallocarbons are compounds of boron, hydrogen, carbon and cobalt.
These compounds block the virus from replicating in a way that all the drugs we use today can't, so they can overcome the problem of resistance.
In their work, the scientists have developed new 'improved' compounds prepared on the basis of knowledge of the molecular mechanism of their binding to the viral protein.
Metal carbons have a unique three-dimensional structure: two multilayered cages made up of boron, hydrogen and carbon atoms, coupled by a single metal atom, in this case cobalt.
Homemade and Resistant Virus
HIV protease is a protein of the HIV virus that is essential for the life cycle of the virus.
Without the HIV protease-induced virus cleavage, no mature infectious virus particles would be produced.
"If we stop the HIV protease, we also stop the virus from multiplying in the patient's body", explain the scientists in a press release issued by the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry of the CR Academy of Sciences.
In the paper published in the Journal of Medicinal Chemistry, the scientists describe whole series of compounds in which two pairs of the cage (see table) are linked by a short organic chain, which is then systematically modified.
Slightly weaker but more reliable
The effects of this series of substances against the HIV protease were tested in a test tube, including its resistant (resistant) variants obtained from HIV-infected patients.
The effect of metallocarbons on the common enzyme variant is not as strong as that of the drugs used in clinical practice, but it does not lose its effect on the resistant variants against which the drugs used are often ineffective.
The unique mechanism of action and other characteristics, such as biological and chemical stability, low toxicity and the possibility of further chemical formations, make the metallocarbons interesting compounds for further research aimed at developing effective drugs against HIV, says Pavlina Rezacova, head of the Laboratory of Structural Biology of the Institutes of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry and the Institute of Molecular Genetics of the Academy of Sciences.
ODS went after Fischer, who's fighting back.
The ODS chairman, Mirek Topolanek, called the approved budget for next year "horrible" and said that the government of Prime Minister Jan Fischer should consider its continued existence.
The Prime Minister described the ODS's statement as 'strong statements'.
There's supposed to be time for analysis.
Deputy ODS Chairman Petr Necas said that the concept of a civil servant cabinet with the support of the CSSD, ODS and the Green Party was clearly no longer working.
The Commission has already made a number of proposals to the Council and Parliament, including a proposal to the Council to make the European Parliament responsible for the implementation of the budget.
The approach of the ODS and the Social Democrats to the problem of public deficits is diametrically different, as pointed out by Necas.
Parliament adopted the 2010 budget on Wednesday, albeit with left-wing amendments worth more than 12 billion kroner.
Parliament has increased the money for civil servants' salaries, for the maintenance of social benefits and for direct payments to farmers.
The government has thus resisted the Social Democrats' suggestions that they should increase the budget deficit covertly.
The Czech Republic was to run a deficit of 163 billion crowns.
The ODS left the Chamber before the vote, so it has complied with the wishes of the government, because the amended budget is also only a less bad version of the budgetary provisional.
Disappointment and Futility
Finance Minister Eduard Janota spoke of his disappointment and sense of futility, while Prime Minister Jan Fischer said the government was still assessing the situation.
Necas is convinced that if Janota had seriously threatened to resign in the event that the amendments were adopted, the situation would have been different.
According to Czech TV, Janota reported to the Prime Minister for Monday after government business.
In doing so, he has indicated that he is considering whether to continue in office.
The reason for this is his disappointment with the negotiation of the budget.
According to Necas, the Social Democrats (CSSD) who had imposed the changes in the budget did not do anything in the government.
The Prime Minister should also make it clear that he will resign if Parliament continues to pass deficit-increasing legislation, for example on sickness and pension benefits or the new Labour Code.
Topekolan: The ODS-nominated ministers were not wrong
This is Prime Minister Fischer's business and the whole government's business.
The ministers nominated by the ODS made no mistakes, Topolanek stressed in a text message from the US.
It mentioned that some ministries have people in deputy positions who are familiar with TOP 09 who voted against the budget.
Necas stressed that if Fischer decides to abandon the fight against the high level of public deficits, "it is perfectly logical and correct that he should rely on the left-wing majority currently in parliament".
Then he allegedly cannot count on the support and tolerance of the citizen democrats.
I have not thought about it, and when it comes up I will deal with it, said Martin Bartak, the Minister of Defence nominated by the Civic Democrats, to journalists in Parliament.
Prime Minister Fischer flew to Brussels for the European Council meeting this afternoon.
The ODS resigned at the Prime Minister's request.
The Commissioner also stressed that the ODS would probably vote against the amended budget in Parliament on Wednesday if the Prime Minister specifically asked the MPs from the Citizens' Democratic Party to allow the budget to be adopted.
The Commission is also proposing to introduce a new system of taxation for the benefit of all citizens, which would be based on the principle of equal treatment of men and women.
I didn't realize my voice was missing.
Even when I gave up the mandate, I knew that the next few months would be about the Bolshevization of Parliament and the destruction of all the positives, Topolanek himself reacted.
According to the new timetable of the CD (Czech Railways), fewer trains will run for approximately the same fare.
The Czech Railways will stop or reduce some of the less busy express and local trains from 13 December, while other services will be increased.
The total volume of traffic will be reduced by two percent from the date of the new timetable's entry into force.
Most fares are inclusive, with no change to the basic and customer fares.
The railway provides several connections to the capital, for example to the inhabitants of the Ostrava region, using Pendolino trains for this route.
The express train will no longer run to Bratislava (Pressburg).
Fewer high-speed trains will also run on the Prague-Pisek-Budweis route, and direct connections from Prague to Letohrad will be reduced.
The largest reduction is planned for the railway in the district of Hradec Kralove (Königsgraz), by a total of eight per cent, while an increase is expected for Prague and the surrounding area.
Two night trains on the Prague-Tabor-Budweis route will also be cancelled and the operation of some express trains on the Prague-Pisek-Budweis route will be reduced to a few days a week.
The biggest changes are the introduction of the new direct route from Milovice to Prague, so that the inhabitants of Milovice now have to cross at Lysa nad Labem.
This is the fifteenth route of the suburban transport system Esko, which was opened thanks to the electrification of the railway from Lysa nad Labem to Milovice.
The long-distance services to the capital will terminate at the Prague Central Station.
The CD introduces more SC Pendolino lines between Prague and Ostrava and the trains to Sumperk/Jesenik will run in two-hour intervals.
Passengers have not been able to travel to Bratislava by Pendolino since December 13.
This year's budget for regional railways: 200 million increase
The high-speed trains are ordered and paid for by the Ministry of Transport, the railways will receive a total of 4 billion crowns next year to compensate for the so-called liquidity loss, as in this year.
This year, the regional trains are 200 million Czech crowns more expensive.
For the local and express trains, the railway has renewed a ten-year contract, which until now had been concluded for only one year.
The railways praise the system, perhaps that is why they have not raised the price of the vast majority of tickets.
The changes are only for one-day CD Net and low-cost eLiska Internet tickets.
For passengers without a card, the CD Net price is increased from 450 to 600 kroner.
The price of eLiska will then depend on the distance travelled, until now it has been uniform for travel between any county towns and costs 160 kroner.
Filipino militants arrest more than 50 people, the children have been released.
Militants abducted 75 people in the southern Philippines today, including some elementary school students and their teachers.
This was reported by the AFP news agency, which originally reported only about 65 abducted persons.
All 17 children detained were released after eight hours, including one teacher.
The abduction took place in the province of Agusan del Sur.
About 19 militants allegedly used the hostages as human shields to escape the police.
The local negotiators are now working to secure the release of the remaining hostages.
According to AFP, the militants belong to the New People's Army (NPA), the armed wing of the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP).
According to AP, the police pursued the kidnappers because of the violence that triggered revenge actions between the two local family clans.
In the southern Philippines, in the province of Maguindanao, martial law was declared due to the recent massacre in which 57 people were killed.
Among the victims of the massacre of November 23, which coincided with the election for the governor's office, were 30 journalists.
Suspected of involvement in the massacre, the governor of this southern Philippine province and his father Andal Ampatuan, patriarch of the influential Ampatuan clan, were arrested.
Muslim separatists are also active on Mindanao.
The European Union is not only a member of the European Union but also a member of the European Union.
The story of South Africa affects everyone, says Morgan Freeman aka Nelson Mandela
In the coming days, the new Hollywood film by Clint Eastwood will hit American theaters, "Invictus: The Undefeated", which is part of the life story of former South African president Nelson Mandela.
The role of the world-famous anti-apartheid fighter has been given to Morgan Freeman, who was supposedly handpicked by Mandela himself some years ago.
The supporting role of legendary South African rugby champion Francois Pienaar has been given to Matt Damon.
The film's release has also sparked reactions from critics and the public.
The people of South Africa
His full name is Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela, born on July 18, 1918, in Mvez, South Africa.
In 1988 he was awarded the Sakharov Prize, and in 1993 he was jointly awarded the Nobel Peace Prize with de Klerk.
He was elected President of the Republic of South Africa in 1994-1999.
Great expectations are being placed on the film because it is coming to the cinemas at a time when South Africa is on the cusp of preparations for the World Cup, and at the same time the media is shocking the world public with frightening news about the rising racial hatred and discrimination of the inhabitants by the black ruling majority.
According to the AP news agency, the reaction to the new film in South Africa has been generally positive for now, despite numerous reservations about casting the lead roles with American Hollywood stars.
Morgan Freeman is proud of his new film, in his own words.
I've dreamed of this role for years and prepared well for it.
I also met Nelson Mandela in person on several occasions so that I could, as they say, absorb his energy, he said in an interview after the film's premiere in Los Angeles.
I think it's good that this film allows us to get to know Mandela and his message.
The Commission has also been asked to present a report on the implementation of the new financial regulation.
In the national rugby team uniform
Based on the book by British author John Carlin, the film, In the Role of the Enemy: Nelson Mandela and the Game That United the People, portrays the South African human rights activist during his first presidential term.
Morgan Freeman, in the course of the film, tries to bring together two racial and for a year and a day separated populations and, like Nelson Mandela in 1995, he also enters the World Cup in his role in the South African national rugby team, which South Africa won at that time.
For his walk on the grass in a dress, which is considered almost a sacred act in South Africa, Mandela received a standing ovation from the predominantly white audience fourteen years ago, and gained the respect of the white population.
The Rugby Championship may be the way to bring people together again as one people, said rugby player Chester Williams, who was the only "black" on the national team in 1995.
Whether the tense situation in South Africa will improve remains to be seen.
But the white South Africans are sceptical, as revealed in a recent interview for LN by the rugby fan, Christopher Dawson, who fled the country for the UK.
The championship will begin on June 11, 2010.
In the Louny area, transformers are burning for several 10 million crowns.
The fire broke out in the morning at the transformer of the Ceps company in the switching plant near the municipality of Vyskov in the Louny area.
According to the spokesman of the district fire brigade Usti nad Labem, Lukas Marvan, six units intervened in the fire.
The fire department originally wanted to burn out the transformers, but later changed their minds and now the fire is put out with a mixture of water, foam and special extinguishers.
It was caused by a technical malfunction, a short circuit in the transformer.
No one was injured, but the accident did not endanger the safety of the line system, according to company spokeswoman Pavla Mandatova.
The damage was estimated at several 10 million crowns, more precisely the damage will be able to be estimated only after the fire.
The damaged transformer must be replaced with a new one according to the Mandatova.
The Commission has also proposed to the Council that the European Parliament should be consulted on the proposal for a directive on the protection of the environment by the use of energy from renewable sources.
According to Sona Holingerova, spokesperson for the CEZ company for Northern Bohemia, the electricity supply was not interrupted, the fire at the transformer station did not affect the functioning of households, public authorities and companies.
A.G. Ceps is the sole operator of the 400 kV and 220 kV electricity transmission lines in the Czech Republic.
It maintains, renovates and develops 39 switches with 67 transformers, which transmit electrical energy in a distribution system and a line of 4339 kilometres.
Jancura is filing criminal charges for slander against three leaders of the CSSD.
The owner of the Student Agency, Radim Jancura, is today filing criminal charges for defamation against three Social Democratic leaders.
The case was brought against Mr Hasek from the Southern Moravia region, Mr Radko Martinek from the Pardubice region and Mr Tesarik, the head of the Olomouc region.
Jancura said this in a twenty-minute interview with Radiojournal.
The action is related to the company's efforts to operate regional train services in some districts.
However, all regions eventually signed the long-term contracts with the Czech Railways.
All three directors attack us and say that we are taking the raisins out, but we have only made the offer on the scope as agreed with them.
They claim that we are more expensive than the Czech Railways because we would know the prices of the Czech Railways that were closed last week.
So we have no choice but to fight back.
Because of this slander of the Student Agency, Jancura told the Radiojournal.
At the same time, he said that he had evidence from all districts that they had taken their steps in accordance with European law.
That is why we are preparing an indictment for the European Commission.
Hasek considers the filing of the complaint to be a continuation of Jancura's media show, which serves him as free publicity for his company and for himself.
I am, of course, prepared to defend my good name and the good name of my district, and I urge other leaders to do the same.
He said that the Commission had already made a number of proposals to the Council and Parliament, and that the Council had already made a number of proposals to the Council and Parliament.
Jancura reported last week that he has invested several million kroner in advertising, which will point out the adverse step of the districts.
He told the Radio Journal that he was suspending the campaign after Christmas and that he wanted to continue it after New Year's.
He specified that he would lead the campaign against corruption as such.
The campaign was launched by Jancura after the counties had reached an agreement with the Czech Railways on the initiative of the Regional Railways and had not issued any tenders for the order worth 150 billion Crowns.
Vancura considers that such conduct is illegal and contrary to the requirements of the European Court of Justice.
Because of the criticism of train traffic in the districts, Jancura said, a member of the CSSD had already threatened him.
The only threat was that if we didn't do this, we could lose the bus licenses.
He introduced himself as a representative of the CSSD, I know who he is, I will not say his name, Jancura told Radiojournal today.
Vaccination against pneumococcal disease free of charge and voluntarily
Vaccination against pneumococcus will change from January onwards.
It is the first to be free and voluntary for the families.
But there are already voices saying that mandatory vaccination would be more effective.
Preparations for the introduction of free vaccination against pneumococcal disease are at an all time high.
The Institute of Medicine already sets the maximum prices for vaccines that health insurance companies must pay.
The experts are also aware of the vaccination procedure.
Other vaccines
Free vaccines for children in August
From January onwards, children born on 2 August of the previous year and afterwards can be vaccinated against pneumococcus free of charge.
The condition is that they have not received a dose of the vaccine.
If you have started vaccination last year or earlier, you must pay for further revaccination.
The first dose of vaccine must be given between the 3rd and 5th month of life.
Last year, a quarter of families had their children vaccinated against pneumococcal disease.
The parents paid 1,600 krona and more for a dose.
Four doses are required for the vaccination of the youngest children.
In all, experts estimate that health insurance companies spend between 300,000 and 450,000 crowns a year on vaccine doses.
But they save on the treatment that the children would need without vaccination.
So far, the state has spent about $500,000 a year on all the vaccinations for the kids.
The compulsory vaccination was introduced with the so-called Janota package.
Pneumococcal infections cause inflammation of the middle ear, but also cause serious infections including meningitis and blood poisoning.
We have a number of children who are dying from pneumococcal infections in hospitals, up to 28 children under 10 years of age.
In addition to the Czech Republic, the compulsory vaccination of children against pneumococcal disease has been introduced in some 40 countries.
Will the vaccination be compulsory?
At the same time, it is said that this vaccination could be made compulsory in the future.
From January, this will be paid by the insurance companies and will be voluntary.
The head of the citizens' association Nahlas, Rudolf Kalovsky, for example, mentioned that compulsory vaccination would be better.
His association has been campaigning for the pneumococcal vaccine for a long time.
The experts at the international conference where our association was involved were not very happy with the fact that we have voluntary vaccination.
It's not ideal.
On the other hand, we are glad that we have succeeded in at least getting this through.
I believe that this is the way we must go now, Kalovsky said.
The Ministry of Health does not want to change the vaccination procedure against pneumococcus.
The Commission is also proposing to extend the scope of the directive to include the use of the word 'express' in the wording of the directive.
Voluntary vaccination has its drawbacks, the doctors say.
The president of the Association of Practical Pediatricians, Hana Cabrnochova, admits that voluntary vaccination has its drawbacks.
If all children were vaccinated, then one could think about reducing the number of repeat vaccinations. "In a situation where the vaccine is so expensive, we understand the political decision that this vaccination was started as voluntary", says Alldingst Cabrnochova.
Experts expect that over 80 percent of parents will have their infants vaccinated against pneumococci by next year.
The pneumocycoccal vaccine is also groundbreaking in that it is the first area vaccination to be paid for by health insurance rather than by the state.
Insurance companies should spend the money on prevention so they can save for further treatment, Cabrnochova said.
Doctors have to buy the vaccines themselves.
But this raises a concern for the pediatric practitioners about the procurement of vaccines.
The original plan was to have the vaccines purchased by the insurance companies and then distributed to the doctors in the same way as other vaccines distributed to them by the government.
Some MEPs feared that the insurance companies could "take money out of health insurance".
So doctors will have to buy the vaccines themselves and wait for the insurance companies to pay for them.
It is estimated that each individual practitioner will have to spend 40,000 kroner a month, a considerable sum.
This will not be easy, Cabrnochova says.
US artist son involved in "museum theft"
The son of famed American fantasy artist Frank Frazetta has been accused of trying to steal $20 million worth of paintings from his father's museum.
According to the Pennsylvania State Police, Alfonso Frank Frazetta was caught loading 90 paintings into his trailer.
Frank Frazetta Jr. and another man used an excavator to break into the museum in the Pocono Mountains.
Eighty-one-year-old Frank Frazetta Sr. is famous for his portrayal of characters like Conan the Barbarian and Tarzan.
As the Associated Press reported, the artist was in Florida at the time of the incident.
AP quoted an unnamed police official as saying that Frank Frazetta Jr. may have been motivated by a family feud.
The agency reported that, according to a police affidavit, Frazetta Junior claimed he was instructed by his father "to break into the museum by any means necessary to get all the paintings into storage".
The agency said Frank Frazetta Sr. denied giving any permission.
Labour defends budget and tax increases
The ministers defended the tax increases and spending cuts announced in the preliminary budget report against criticism from the opposition, the business community and the trade unions.
The Conservatives said Alistair Darling had "missed" an opportunity to show he was serious about reducing the deficit by delaying decisions until after the election.
The Chancellor of the Exchequer was also criticized for targeting low- and middle-income workers.
His main proposals include a 0.5% increase in social security and a 1% cap on public wage bills for 2011.
Social security funds
The unions have protested against punishing low-wage workers for a recession they did not cause and warned of "problems" to come.
The increase in social security - to about £3 billion a year - has angered the private sector, which says it is a tax on jobs, when the focus should be on economic recovery.
The increase, which is restricted to those earning more than £20,000 a year, will affect about 10 million workers.
The Commission shall be empowered to adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 7 to specify the criteria for the selection of the Member State concerned.
Increase of social security by a further 0,5% from April 2011
This year, the economy contracted by more than expected 4.75 percent
New 50% tax on banking bonuses
1 percent increase in corporate tax for small businesses
Tax reliefs for electric vehicles and wind turbines
Increase in state pensions by 2.5%
The Treasury estimates that someone with an annual income of £30,000 will be £90 poorer per year and someone with £40,000 per year will be £190 poorer, while a person with an annual income of £10,000 will be £110 richer.
Ministers said their goal of halving the deficit by 2013 meant "difficult choices", but they also said that 60% of the burden of the surcharge would fall on the top 5% of earners.
Finance Minister Stephen Timms denied that the proposed tax increases and spending cuts were "a drop in the bucket" compared to the necessary measures.
"These are big numbers, they will bring us the deficit halving and this is also absolutely necessary over the next four years", he told the BBC.
Timms said he was confident that the economy would return to growth by the end of the year.
Labour's predictions of future economic growth - which affect the level of new debt and the speed of deficit reduction - were called into question after the Chancellor of the Exchequer was forced to revise earlier figures.
He said in his opinion that the economy would probably contract by 4.75% this year - far more than the 3.5% fall predicted in April  while debt would be £3 billion higher than previously estimated.
"Missed opportunity"
The Conservatives, who are to launch a new advertising campaign on Thursday to warn of Labour's "debt crisis", said the proposed £789 billion of debt over the next six years was unsustainable.
They added that the ministers failed to present a credible plan on how they will pay it back and cynically shy away from difficult decisions until after the elections - which must be held no later than June 2010.
"They have said nothing of significance about what they are going to do", said Shadow Chancellor Philip Hammond. "They had their opportunity to do this and they let it pass".
"The big announcements will be made after the election, whoever wins it".
The Commission has also taken the following measures:
Labour insists that schools, hospitals and the police be spared from future cuts, unlike the Conservatives' proposals, which see the deficit cap coming faster and sooner.
But the Liberal Democrats said that the money raised by the tax hikes and spending cuts would be used to cover next year's spending, not to reduce the deficit, and therefore argue that the plans were "built on sand".
The BBC's political editor, Nick Robinson, said that some of the announcements - such as the inflation adjustment above on some disability pensions next April - would expose the Chancellor to the charge of vote-rigging, as the money could simply be reclaimed next year.
The Commission is also proposing that the Commission should be able to provide the necessary financial support to the Member States in the event of a crisis.
"Hohler Etat" (the name of the company)
Although the ministers did not announce budget details beyond 2011, economists say the pressure on public spending will only take effect in the medium term.
The renowned Institute for Tax Investigations said the Treasury Secretary's figures would mean big cuts in many areas, possibly including transportation, higher education, science and defense in the future.
"It just postpones the pain for later", said its director, Robert Chote.
"The big announcements are not made until after the election, whoever wins", added Roger Bootle, an economic consultant at the economic audit firm Deloitte.
"This was just the hollow preliminary report. The markets are seeing it".
FBI is investigating "captures of US citizens in Pakistan"
The FBI is investigating the arrest of five reported U.S. citizens on suspicion of extremist connections in Pakistan.
The men were arrested during a raid on a house in Sarghoda, in the eastern Punjab province, the US embassy in Pakistan told the BBC.
The FBI said they're investigating whether these are the same men reported missing in Virginia last month.
The State Department said they're also looking for information on the men.
Three of them are said to be of Pakistani origin, one is of Egyptian origin and the other has a Yemeni background.
"If they are American citizens, we are of course very interested in the charges against them and the circumstances in which they are being held", said spokesman Ian Kelly.
FBI spokeswoman Katherine Schweit said the agency was informed of the arrests and was in contact with the families of the missing students.
"We are working with Pakistani authorities to establish their identities and the purpose of their stay there, if they are indeed the missing students", she said.
The Pakistani embassy in Washington said the men were arrested in a house owned by the uncle of one of the students.
He said the local police had taken an interest in the house before and that no charges had been filed against the men arrested.
Reuters news agency reported that Secretary of State Hillary Clinton declined to comment on the arrests, but said the US must "work closely with Afghanistan and Pakistan to root out the infrastructure of terrorism that continues to recruit and train people".
The five students were reported missing by their families in Northern Virginia in late November.
Amnesty condemns "abuses" in Iran
According to a report by the human rights organization Amnesty International, the human rights situation in Iran is still as bad as it has been for the past 20 years.
The report details "patterns of abuse" by the regime, both before and after the disputed presidential elections in June.
One man quoted in the report said he was beaten and burned with cigarettes, while another said he was threatened with rape.
Iran rejected earlier criticism of its human rights record.
Officials said such criticism was politically motivated.
Thousands of people were arrested and dozens killed in Iran after the disputed election of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, leading to the largest street protests since the Islamic Revolution of 1979.
Dozens were sentenced to prison, and prosecutors said at least five people were sentenced to death.
The BBC's Tehran correspondent Jon Leyne, now based in London, said that at the start of the protests, the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, acknowledged some of the abuse allegations and ordered the closure of Kahrizak prison.
But since then, the authorities have shown no tolerance for criticism, our correspondent said.
"False confession" is a common term in the criminal justice system.
Amnesty International cited the report of 26-year-old computer science student Ebrahim Mehtari, who said he was charged for "working with Facebook networks" and protesting the election results.
"They often punched me in the face", he was quoted as saying.
"I was burned with cigarettes under my eyes, in my neck, on my head... they threatened me with death and they humiliated me".
After five days, he signed a false confession and was released on the street, still bleeding and half-conscious, Amnesty said.
The defeated presidential candidate Mehdi Karroubi said that some protesters who were arrested after the election were tortured to death in prison in August and others were raped.
Iranian authorities denied the rape allegations but admitted that abuses had taken place.
Amnesty also cited the case of a former prisoner who said he and 75 others had been held in a container at Kahrizak prison for more than eight weeks.
Amnesty acknowledged that the Iranian parliament and judicial authorities had set up a committee to investigate the post-election unrest and the government's response to it, but that the mandates and power of these bodies were unclear and the findings obtained by the parliamentary committees were not made public.
The group said that in the past three weeks, at least 90 people have been arrested to prevent further demonstrations.
Skihang was installed in the city park
Over 100 tons of artificial snow were used to turn a Bristol landmark into a racing circuit.
The ski slope of this park event attracted 16 semi-professional skiers and snowboarders, who competed for cash prizes.
At the top of the hill in Brandon Hill Park, there was a short jump off at the beginning of a 100-meter hill.
John Hickman, a fourth-year medical student, said that there was a beautiful view from the top of the ridge, but it was also quite intimidating.
It's a great view with all the city lights flashing down below.
He added: "There are some of the best skiers and snowboarders in the country here - some real talents".
Prizes were awarded for the best tricks or stunts performed on the slope.
After the event on Thursday night, the snow will be left to melt.
Still she and we
Can Islam be French?
Pluralism and pragmatism in a secular state.
At a time when Swiss voters have voted to ban the construction of minarets and there is widespread concern about the alleged Islamization of Europe, an American academic, John Bowen, has written a well-founded and well-thought-out report on whether Muslims can and should be integrated into one of Europe's most secularized societies.
Some readers will read this new book out of admiration for the author's latest work, Why the French Don't Like Headscarves (2006), an elegant and poignant study of a contentious issue that divided and occupied the country for a decade and a half and whose impact is still being felt today.
Bowen's latest book offers a broader and bolder spectrum.
As a good anthropologist, he wants to know not only what the politicians and the media say about Islam in France, but what is really happening in the field.
He has spent months in mosques, schools and institutes that now offer the five to six million Muslims in France what Bowen calls "Islamic free spaces".
He's a good listener, he plays back debates between teachers and students about the questions that concern them most.
Should a Muslim marry in a mosque or a town hall (or both)?
Should young Muslims be taught about evolution and gay rights?
Can a Muslim woman marry a non-Muslim man?
Is it permissible for a Muslim to use an interest-based banking system to get a mortgage?
It is these seemingly secular matters, he argues, that make up daily life, in stark contrast to the political dramas that occupy the media.
The author identifies a new generation of imams, teachers and intellectuals, none of them with a known name, possibly except for Tarik Ramadan, a Swiss-born Arab-Muslim scholar and academic.
This new generation is trying to open the debate about how it is possible to be a good Muslim and a good citizen in a modern secular society.
They don't have all the facts on their side.
Conservatives are suspicious of the idea of a French or European Islam.
The thinkers and activists Bowen interviewed are mostly at odds with their Salafi counterparts  advocates of purist Sunni Islam linked to Saudi Arabia  who today have a small but influential presence among Europe's Muslims.
Bowen believes that Muslim values and French secularism could be compatible.
But a deal requires a give and take on both sides.
He questions the extent to which French policymakers (and the intellectual elite that so passionately guards the separation of church and state) are truly committed to pluralism.
He suggests that Muslims may be receiving harsher treatment than Catholics, Protestants and Jews, who in turn have had to make their historic compromise with secular republicanism.
He sees a "tightening of the value-screws" rather than a growing pragmatism.
Can Islam be French? After reading this book, one is inclined to say "Yes, but not yet".
The world's most bleak prospect
The Arctic is changing faster and more dramatically than any other environmental region on Earth.
The ice that marks it melts at an alarming rate, taking with it life that cannot survive anywhere else.
Oil, gas, shipping and fishing interests have moved into the newly open waters, with diplomats, lawyers and now authors in their wake.
Richard Ellis, an author and illustrator, draws a natural history of the icon of the North, the polar bear, in On Thin Ice.
Well versed in the complicated history and politics of whaling, he describes the long tradition of Arctic explorers who have proved themselves in hunting the polar bears.
Admiral Nelson's encounter with a polar bear as a brave 14-year-old ensign at sea, fighting with only the butt of his musket, is certainly a legend, but others are true.
Young bears, caught while swimming behind the bodies of their recently killed mothers, were brought to zoos and circuses.
A circus performance in the early 20th century featured 75 polar bears in one show.
Even today, zoos typically still occupy one millionth of the living space of a wild mammal. The climate is rarely suitable: the polar bear in Singapore was turned completely green by the algae growing in the hollow hairs of its skin.

Ellis refers to the accounts of other authors and historians and often returns to the threat that hunters pose to the survival of the species.
Although banned in Norway, America, and Russia, the practice continues in Greenland and Canada, where helicopter hunters and sleigh-riding Inuit use high-powered assault rifles to hunt their prey.
Ironically, the waters north of these two hunting nations will retain the ice the longest.
In his new book "After the Ice", Alun Anderson, a former editor of the science magazine New Scientist, offers a clear and disturbing description of the science of the Arctic and a gripping insight into how the future might unfold.
Not that scientists have all the answers.
Neither atmospheric scientists nor oceanographers can adequately explain the rate of change.
But this is not because of a lack of explanation.
The pioneering voyages of Fridtjof Nansen in the late 19th and early 20th centuries first revealed the complexity of the pack ice.
Cold War submarines were able to detect the shifting grid when they were underway.
Satellite surveys and the large-scale placement of probes on icebergs are useful additions, but much is still accomplished by intrepid people camping outside in the cold.
Anderson takes a look at the strange, tiny world of the inflow system within the Arctic ice, formed by saltwater streams that are compressed when it freezes.
But everything from the bear on the ice to the microscopic wonders in the ice, all are threatened by it once the summer ice melts, which is expected to happen between 2013 and 2050.
"In a few months... this could be us".
Marines were among the 6,000 who laid wreaths at Arlington
Private De'Angelo Robinson traveled seven hours by bus to lay a single wreath on the grave of a soldier he'd never met.
For him and the other Marines who made the journey from Camp Johnson in Jacksonville, North Carolina, to Arlington National Cemetery to decorate graves, the day was a tribute to the men and women whose footsteps they walked in.
In a few months, from wherever we are brought back from, we could be that", Robinson said of the fallen soldiers.
If we were, I'd wish someone would do the same for me, so I'm trying to show my respect.
He was one of more than 6,000 volunteers who had gathered Saturday morning to lay wreaths at the graves of veterans in several sections of Arlington Cemetery.
Morrill Worcester, owner of the Worcester Wreath Company in Harrington, Maine, established the tradition in 1992 when he and a few others decided to decorate several hundred graves in Arlington Cemetery.
It's an 18-year-old tradition now, and Morrill and his wife Karen, who make this trip every year, stop in various cities along the way to hold events dedicated to people in the military and victims of terrorism.
The Worcesters also founded a non-profit organization, Wreaths Across America, which has expanded the event to other states.
This year, volunteers placed more than 16,000 wreaths on the graves at Arlington Cemetery, at areas of the Pentagon, at graves at Fayetteville National Cemetery in Arkansas, at Battery Park in New York, and at the United Airlines Flight 93 Memorial in Shanksville, Pennsylvania.
The Walmart Foundation has donated more than $150,000 for the purchase and transportation of the beads for the second time.
Charleen Hunt, 70, of Westminster, said she made the trip to Arlington in memory of her husband, a deceased career soldier.
Although her husband is not buried in Arlington, Hunt said this is her way of giving back to those who made the sacrifices.
She said it's a small contribution we civilians can make to support our soldiers.
It's like visiting a family cemetery.
Wrapped in layers of warm clothing, the volunteers walked across the vast lawns and hills of the cemetery.
The volunteers targeted older graves from World War I, II and Vietnam, as these are not visited as often as the newer graves, according to the organizers.
The atmosphere was joyous, with children playing and couples holding hands as they carried the fresh pine branches to the graying tombstones.
Each round wreath was dark green with a small red loop attached to the top.
Section 60, which is nearby and where most Iraq and Afghanistan veterans are buried, remained mostly quiet.
The United Service Organizations spent 1,000 wreaths to decorate this section, but the gloomy mood of recent wars filled this area.
Some were crying, others were praying, and families and friends were clinging to one another in the cold air.
Some read out loud the names carved in stone, while others stooped to small black and white placemats that had been put in the damp mud for those whose tombstones were not yet finished.
Sandra Lockwood was one of the many mothers who shed bitter tears at the grave of her son.
She's an eight-hour drive from Zanesfield, Ohio, to visit the grave of Marine Corps petty officer David Shane Spicer, who was killed in action in July.
No one should ever forget why we are free...my son paid for it, she said.
"If I'm long gone, I want someone to remember him".
US government contractor arrested by Cuban authorities
The Cuban government has arrested a U.S. government contractor who was selling mobile phones and notebook computers in the country, State Department officials said Saturday.
The contractor, who has not been identified, works for Development Alternatives Inc., based in Bethesda.
The company works on projects for clients such as USAID, the US Agency for International Development and the World Bank.
Consular officers from the U.S. Embassy in Havana are trying to gain access to the detainee who was arrested on December 5th.
The specific charges have not been made public, although under Cuban law, a Cuban national or a foreign visitor can be arrested for almost anything on the charge of "endangering".
All so-called counterrevolutionary activities involving minor protests and critical writings are at risk of arrest.
Graffiti and statements hostile to the government are considered serious crimes.
Cuba has a growing community of bloggers, led by popular journalist Yoani Sánchez, who frequently writes about how she and her husband are being persecuted and attacked by government agents.
Sánchez has repeatedly requested permission to leave the country to receive prizes, but this has always been refused.
The arrest of an American contractor is likely to increase tensions between the Castro Brother's communist government in Cuba and the Obama administration, which has sought a "slow" rapprochement to improve relations with the island.
News of the arrest was first reported Friday night by the New York Times.
The new US policy emphasizes that the United States will reciprocate if the Cuban government takes concrete steps in this direction, such as releasing political prisoners and creating more space for opposition.
Mobile phones and laptops are legal in Cuba, although they are new and highly sought after products in a country where the average salary for a government employee is $15 per month.
The Cuban government has only been allowing ordinary citizens to buy mobile phones since this year, and they are mainly used for sending text messages, as a 15-minute phone call would cost a day's wages.
Internet access is extremely limited on the island.
It is available in expensive hotels and there for foreign visitors and at some governmental institutions, such as universities.
Cubans who want to log in often have to give their names to the government.
Access to many websites is restricted.
It's rare for an American to be arrested in Cuba.
Most of the few U.S. citizens who are in prison in Cuba are serving time for crimes such as drug trafficking, said Gloria Berbena, the spokeswoman for the U.S. Interests Section in Havana.
Berbena said she couldn't give any further information on the arrest.
The arrest and detention are clearly wrong.
An activity that would be legal in any other free society - giving away free cell phones - is a crime in Cuba, said Jose Miguel Vivanco, head of the American section of the Human Rights Watch group, which recently released a hard-hitting report on freedom in Cuba entitled "New Castro, Same Cuba", a reference to the inauguration of Raul Castro as the country's leader, replacing the ailing elder brother Fidel.
Vivanco said that very often, within a day, the defendants were arrested, convicted and imprisoned.
He said that any solution would probably be political and that the Cuban government often provokes a negative reaction in the United States, just at the time when both countries are moving towards a more open dialogue.
Pakistani government officials reveal plan to send men to Afghanistan
Pakistani authorities on Saturday uncovered an alleged ringleader of a plot to send five men from northern Virginia to Afghanistan to kill U.S. soldiers, and said they hoped the case could help uncover a vast network of terrorist recruiters scouring the Internet for radicalised young men.
Investigators said they were looking for an obscure insurgent known as Saifullah, who had invited the men to Pakistan after tracking them down because one of them had posted approving comments about terrorist attacks on the YouTube video site.
Saifullah became the leader of these men after they arrived in Pakistan, and tried to help them reach the remote area in Pakistan's tribal belt that is home to Al Qaeda and its terrorist training camps.
But a Pakistani intelligence official briefed on the matter said Saturday that Saifullah had failed to convince al-Qaida leaders that the men were not part of a CIA plot to undermine the terrorist network.
As a result, they were held for days in the eastern city of Sargodha, far from the inhospitable mountains in the northwest that have become a haven for terrorists.
They were considered part of a covert operation.
That is why they were rejected, said the government official, who wished to remain anonymous because of the sensitivity of the matter.
The government official said that the men were not discouraged at all and continued to try to get the right referrals to gain access to the al-Qaida camps when they were arrested by Pakistani law enforcement authorities.
The case of the five men - who are still in Pakistan and are being questioned by the FBI - underscores the crucial role of recruiters in identifying would-be terrorists and, perhaps more importantly, in deciding who is trustworthy.
Since the attacks of September 11, 2001, the U.S. intelligence community has made it a matter of the utmost urgency to house human assets within al Qaeda.
The recruiters of the organization act as gatekeepers, not letting in those whose commitment to the Holy War is not serious enough and those who might be spies.
Prospective American recruits are subject to a special screening by al Qaeda, analysts said.
However, due to their potential access to US targets and their propaganda value, they are also considered extremely attractive to the group.
Evan Kohlmann, a senior analyst at the US-based NEFA Foundation, said that terrorist groups have also become much more careful in recent years about who they allow access to, as US intelligence agencies have become experts in their recruitment methods.
When you try to get someone into these groups, what better way to go than to follow the recruitment model that so many have already followed?
The model is now much more Internet-based.
Tens of thousands of protesters in Copenhagen call for climate action
Tens of thousands of protesters marched through the streets here on Saturday, demanding bolder climate action from the negotiators at the city's Bella Convention Center.
Protesters said 100,000 people had joined the rally, while police estimates put the number at around 25,000.
The event was relatively peaceful, although a handful of masked activists detonated small explosives near some government buildings in the city center.
On a day when little was happening at the UN-sponsored climate talks, thousands of activists marched through the city with banners reading "There is no Planet B" in English and one in Spanish that declared "Earth says 'enough'".
Some celebrities joined the protest, such as Danish model and photographer Helena Christensen, who said that traveling to her mother's native Peru made her aware of the heartbreaking problems the country is facing due to the already visible effects of climate change.
This is part of the reason why I decided to take part in the big demonstration - to spread the word and appeal to world leaders to bring about a fair, ambitious and binding agreement, she said.
It's not an easy task, but it has to be done now and there's no way around it.
Police stopped the protesters from getting too close to the Bella center, saying they had arrested 19 people, mainly due to the fact that they were either masked or carrying pocket knives.
According to Danish law, these actions are prohibited during demonstrations.
According to a bystander who did not want to be named because he is involved in the climate negotiations, masked protesters in black clothing set off several explosive devices near the main canal in Copenhagen, near which several ministries are located.
They threw them near the buildings, he said, adding that they started as flares but were followed by "a few big explosions".
Inside the convention center, people gathered in front of television screens to watch the demonstration throughout the afternoon.
But the protest has apparently not reached the consciousness of top officials like Su Wei, China's chief climate negotiator.
When asked if he thought the demonstration would have a constructive effect on international considerations, he replied in English: "That's something I wasn't even aware of".
He continued in Mandarin, saying, "Because of the size of the venue, I can't hear what's going on outside".
He noted that it depends on the perspective of the individual whether the demonstration would do harm or help.
It shows the focus of the general public and various sectors on the issue of climate change, he said.
On the other hand, "one can also say that they interfere with the negotiations or the freedom of other people".
Exam data show persistent racial disparity
The math performance test scores were welcome good news for the Washington D.C. public schools last week.
Although the D.C. district still lags far behind the nation's top-performing schools, the evidence shows that fourth- and eighth-graders have made faster progress in the past two years than cities that include Atlanta, Chicago and New York.
But what is included in the latest National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) figures is the persistent achievement gap between African-American and white students, both at the local and national level.
The average score of white fourth graders in Washington, D.C., has risen from 262 to 270 (on a scale of 500) in the last two years, while that of their African-American peers has risen only by three points from 209 to 212.
The performance gap actually increased from 53 to 58 points between 2007 and 2009.
The progress of African American eighth graders remained basically the same, dropping by a statistically negligible point from 245 to 244.
The average score of white pupils was not included in the test data because the sample size was not large enough.
The picture over a six-year period is not any more encouraging.
The gap separating white and black fourth graders in 2003, when the first NAEP was recorded in this district, was 60 points (262 to 202).
And although the scores achieved by children in both groups have increased over that time, the difference has hardly diminished at 58 points now.
Some education advocates in the district expressed concern last week that the results, which were hailed by school chancellor Michelle A. Rhee and Democratic mayor Adrian M. Fenty, were driven largely by white students, who are already high-achieving kids.
"This suggests that we have raised the overall score by treating those at the top end of the scale, which is problematic and difficult", said Jeff Smith, a board member of D.C. Voice, a nonprofit group that advocates for educational equity in Washington, D.C.
"I'm not jumping up and down for a two- or three-point margin", said Democratic Washington City Councilman Kwame R. Brown, whose daughter is in fourth grade at Eaton Elementary.
Brown, a frequent critic of Rhee's management style, said the message of the test score is that the city's middle schools are in dire need of attention.
Of course, you always want to see the positive signs, and I respect that.
But what worries me is that we're not spending nearly the time and energy that we should be spending on our middle school.
Rhee said the district must continue to find better ways to meet the needs of low-achieving students.
This autumn, for example, some teachers are being trained to use a new reading curriculum, the Wilson reading system, which targets students in the upper grades of elementary and middle school who have not mastered basic reading skills at the beginning of their school careers and who are significantly behind their peer classmates.
Everyday Mathematics, a curriculum that emphasizes kindergarten through sixth grade play and real-life experiences, was brought to Washington under former chief inspector Clifford Janey, and this curriculum is credited with some of the NAEP advances reported last week.
I think we need to continue to work on getting the best measures to the students who are below the grade level, Rhee said.
Others say the NAEP results highlight the question of whether Rhee can continue to improve the overall performance of the system, while still providing the extra money and resources for the low-performing schools needed to close the gap.
This is a serious dilemma for Michelle Rhee, said Bruce Fuller, professor of education at the University of California, Berkeley, who studies urban test scores.
The conventional remedy is to focus its resources and management reforms on the schools that are in the poorest areas of Washington, D.C.
The targeting could create political repercussions that work against this important agenda item.
The weakness, of course, as with other urban school inspectors, is that she's trying to keep the white and black middle class together.
Our focus is to make sure that we build a system of great schools.
We need to strengthen our neighborhood schools so that all families, no matter where they live, can be sure that their children can get an excellent public schooling.
Janey, who is now the superintendent of schools in Newark, said in an interview this week that one of the most significant elements of closing the achievement gap is extending the traditional public school year, which in Washington is currently 180 days, to compete with charter schools.
It is necessary to increase the school year to around 200 days to have the power to change, said Janey, who reached an agreement with his teachers' union last year for 185 days a year, which he sees as "a milestone" on the way to a bigger increase in the next contract.
Higher education for more people as a vision of the future
The tour bus arrives at Gettysburg College with a loud whistle.
Graciela Rodriguez, 12, gets out and blinks for a moment at the sight of the white pillars, the brick facades, and the emerald green grass.
Graciela's parents barely finished high school in El Salvador.
Until recently, Graciela, who was rescued in Silver Spring and now lives in Riverdale, had also never set foot on a college campus.
Her attitude, and that of the other eighth-graders in the group exploring Gettysburg, where tuition costs $38,690 a year, was that of a reverent visitor rather than an enthusiastic prospective student.
"Yes, I will be here soon!" exclaimed Graciela, who wanted to study medicine, when the guide announced that they had entered the science building.
"Wow, really?" she said thoughtfully when told of the school's low teacher-to-student ratio.
The college in Pennsylvania was the seventh that the kids visited on their three-day tour, and now they've fully embraced the intended message: the question is not whether you're going to college.
The question is where.
On the one hand, there is a growing concern about the large number of U.S.-born children of Hispanic immigrants who do not finish high school or become pregnant as teenagers, but on the other hand, there are also hundreds of thousands who are getting the college education necessary to move up into the middle class.
In fact, one in five of this "second generation" of Hispanics graduates from college, which is a remarkable achievement, since many of their immigrant parents, mostly from Mexico or Central America, came to the U.S. without a high school diploma.
Their success stories are important, researchers say, because they point the way forward for a generation that will play a huge role in the country's workforce.
Those who study high-achieving children say that they often have a natural affinity for school and an innate drive to succeed.
Many of them also have parents who set high goals for their children and find ways to compensate for their lack of familiarity with American schools.
But counseling programs also play a big role in helping Graciela and millions of kids like her get into college, especially when those efforts continue over a long period of time.
When you look at low-income children whose parents don't have the experience and skills to help them navigate the system, a single action at some point won't solve the problem, said Patricia Gándara, a researcher at the University of California at Davis who studied Hispanic students.
We need to think about providing a support network for these children from preschool through high school.
The federal program that funded Graciela's college tour is a useful example.
It's known as GEAR UP, and it provides more than 300 million dollars a year to local school systems to start college-preparation programs that start when low-income students are in middle school and continue until they graduate from high school.
According to the U.S. Department of Education, the program has helped more than 10 million students since 1999, more than 60 percent of whom have gone on to college.
Iraq's oil ministry signs contracts with 10 foreign oil companies
Despite concerns about violence and political instability, the Iraqi government was able to convince major oil companies to rebuild its damaged infrastructure in two auctions that concluded on Saturday.
The 10 contracts signed by the Iraqi Ministry of Oil with foreign oil companies suggest that China, Russia and European oil companies are willing to play a major role in the renewal of Iraq's oil industry, which has been crippled for decades by war and economic sanctions.
American companies could only buy shares in two of the 10 auctioned fields.
Seven American companies had paid to participate in the second auction, which began on Friday.
The only company that made an offer pulled the short straw.
Two American companies were able to secure contracts for fields that were auctioned in June.
The thin-skinned representatives of American oil multinationals at the opening of the Iraqi oil industry surprised the analysts.
Iraq has finally opened its doors after 6 years of war and instead of US companies, Asian and European ones are leading the way, said Ruba Husari, the editor of Iraq Oil Forum, an online news service.
There won't be any more offers in Iraq for a long time.
Security concerns, highlighted by the massive coordinated bombing on Tuesday, and political instability due to the withdrawal of the US military have likely deterred American oil companies from becoming more involved in Iraq, which has the third largest proven crude oil reserves in the world, analysts said.
In some cases, US firms were disadvantaged because competitors, especially Chinese and other state-controlled energy companies, have significantly lower labour costs and are more likely to take risks because they are not accountable to shareholders.
Exxon-Mobil and Occidental Petroleum Inc. were the only American companies able to conclude contracts with the Ministry.
Larger US companies such as Chevron and ConocoPhillips, which have close ties with the Iraqi Ministry of Oil and have provided technical advice in recent years, have come up empty-handed.
The Russian companies Lukoil and Gazprom were the main actors in two of the contracts awarded this weekend.
The state-owned China National Petroleum Corporation has bid for more contracts than any other company and has been able to go home with large packages of contracts for two major fields.
We all know, said the spokesman of the Ministry of Oil, Assam Jihad, that China is on its way to becoming one of the world's major economies as well as a technological power.
We are confident that the Chinese company can compete with its peers and will meet its obligations towards Iraq.
For the tendering procedure, pre-selected companies submitted bids which were then compared to the fee per barrel of oil the Ministry was prepared to pay to increase the output of each field beyond the current level.
Top planner of al Qaeda apparently killed in Pakistan
A top al-Qaeda operative was reportedly killed this week in an apparent US missile attack along the Pakistani border with Afghanistan, US counterterrorism officials reported on Friday.
This, if confirmed, would be the second fatal attack on a high-ranking member of the terrorist organization this fall.
Saleh al-Somali was one of two Arabs who, according to US sources and Pakistani officials in the region, were killed by a number of rockets that hit their vehicle near the town of Miran Shah in North Waziristan province on Tuesday.
Local authorities reported that the missiles were fired from a type of drone used by the CIA in Pakistan's lawless tribal belt.
They were driving in a white vehicle heading towards the Afghan border when the car was hit, a Pakistani civil intelligence official from Miran Shah said by telephone.
Locals suspected of being militants rushed to the scene and quickly took what was left of the "completely destroyed bodies".
Local authorities have not been able to confirm the identity of the victims, but two U.S. counterterrorism officials cited circumstantial evidence that Somalis were among the dead.
Somali has been described as a leading military planner for Al Qaeda, who directed terrorist group operations outside the Afghanistan-Pakistan region.
He was involved in plots around the world, noted a senior official, who asked not to be named, and referred to the sensitive nature of US airstrikes on Pakistani soil.
Assuming his central role, this included planning attacks against the US and Europe.
He took strategic instructions from the top leaders of al Qaeda and translated them into operational planning for possible terrorist attacks.
The second American official said that Somali had risen quickly in the al-Qaeda hierarchy and had good connections with other extremist groups in the region.
"He may not be known to some Americans", said the second official, "but that in no way diminishes the danger he posed to us and our allies".
If his death is confirmed, Somali would be the second top Al Qaeda or Taliban leader to be killed since September, when a similar attack killed Najmuddin Jalolov, the leader of a militant faction in the tribal area, and three other top activists.
The rate of CIA drone strikes has dropped from an average of six operations per month to two since the summer, according to a summary of the Long War Journal, a website maintained by a nonprofit organization.
The decline may be due to improved tactics by terrorist groups that have taken steps to reduce their vulnerability while brutally killing suspected informants, the site reported.
The leading UN envoy in Kabul will resign
The leading UN envoy to Afghanistan, Kai Eide, said on Friday that he would step down from his post in March, ending a tumultuous tenure marred by allegations of widespread corruption in the UN-backed Afghan presidential election.
The second part of the debate was on the situation in Afghanistan.
The UN envoy said he supported the troop increase, but he also expressed concern that the US timetable for military withdrawal, which is set to begin in 18 months, could prompt other NATO governments to withdraw their forces.
We need to speed up the build-up of Afghan security forces and send the right signal to the Afghans that they can trust the international community, Eide said in a telephone interview from Kabul.
The commitment must be long-term.
The Norwegian diplomat also urged the United States and other military powers to increase the number of international civilian helpers to help with the political transition of Afghanistan.
The increase in troops on the military side must be matched by an increase on the civilian side, he said.
Eide said he was not resigning but was fulfilling an agreement he made with his family in March 2008 to stay in Kabul for two years.
He said he wanted to notify the UN-
The European Union is not the only country to have a policy of economic and monetary union.
What I'm saying is he better start looking for a successor, said Eide.
When I came here, there was a two-month gap between my predecessor's departure and my arrival.
According to UN officials, Ban has begun looking for a replacement.
The UN officials say he considered Staffan di Mistura, a Swedish-Italian who recently headed the UN mission in Baghdad, and Jean-Marie Guéhenno, a Frenchman who previously headed UN peacekeeping operations.
Eide's position in Afghanistan was put to the test after his former deputy, Peter W. Galbraith, accused him in September of favouring President Hamid Karzai in the country's presidential election and concealing evidence of massive electoral fraud.
Eide denied all the allegations, but also said that the allegations by Galbraith - who was fired - "undoubtedly damaged the mission because there was already a great deal of scepticism about international interference in the election".
Eide said he recommended the appointment of a senior civilian representative to coordinate the relief efforts of the American-led forces in Afghanistan.
He also urged the UN leadership to allow his successor to hire more personnel from the United States and other Western countries who donate to the Afghan mission, saying that this would strengthen their confidence that their money is being used properly.
Eide expressed his disappointment at the limitations on his forces in Afghanistan, saying that the cumbersome UN recruitment arrangements have undermined his ability to bring in capable people.
The UN rules are designed so that since May, he said, I could only hire one person.
This is catastrophic and must not continue.
US Secretary of Defense Gates: Iran must expect additional sanctions
Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates said Friday that world powers will soon impose "significant additional sanctions" on Iran for not participating in talks on its nuclear plans.
Gates, during a seven-day tour of the war zones in Afghanistan and Iraq, spoke to a group of about 300 US troops in northern Iraq and downplayed the prospect of military action against the Islamic Republic of Iran.
The European Union must not forget that the European Union is a major player in the world economy.
"One of the things that I have been very concerned about, if we have learned anything from Iraq in the last six years, is the unpredictability of the war".
The Obama administration is considering a package of sanctions targeting Iran's military and political elite, but Gates has announced that some of the sanctions could also affect average Iranians.
He said a "package of positive and negative incentives" was needed "to convince the Iranian government that it is in fact less protected with nuclear weapons" because "their people will suffer tremendously" under the sanctions.
On Friday, White House spokesman Robert Gibbs issued a statement in which the US government joined European leaders in warning that Iran would face "credible" consequences if it did not comply with the demands of the UN Security Council and its nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency, for its nuclear programme.
Iran continues to maintain that its nuclear technology is intended for peaceful purposes.
At talks in Geneva on 1 October, Iran said it would resume talks to curb its nuclear programme and give up a substantial portion of its stockpile of enriched uranium in exchange for urgently needed nuclear fuel for its medical research reactor.
The US government has pushed for this type of agreement to build trust between the two parties and to buy time for negotiations.
But Iran appears to have since pulled out of the negotiations on the interim agreements -- partly, experts say, because Iranian leaders are divided over whether they should commit to the United States.
The fact that Iran has left the international community standing on some of the proposals they had already agreed to in early October has, frankly, brought the international community, including the Russians and the Chinese, together in a way they never have been in conjunction with important additional sanctions on Iran, Gates said.
President Obama has set December 31 as the deadline for Iran to respond to these proposals before pursuing other options, including what Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton once called "oppressive sanctions".
In a statement issued in New York, Iran's mission to the United Nations on Thursday condemned what it called "baseless and unfounded claims" by some members of the Security Council about Iran's nuclear activities and said it was ready to continue talks with the United States and five other world powers "to reach an appropriate long-term solution".
Gates, who was scheduled to return to Washington on Friday, met with Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki in the morning before flying to the oil-rich Kurdish region of Iraq to meet with the soldiers in Kirkuk and Kurdish officials in Irbil.
Tensions between the Kurds and the Arab majority in Iraq remain high, particularly over borders, property rights and the distribution of public revenues.
Gates urged both sides to reduce the potential for conflict to prevent delays in U.S. plans to reduce U.S. troop strength from 115,000 to 50,000 by the end of August.
The US representatives quoted Gates as saying to Masud Barzani, the president of the Kurdish Regional Government, "We will preserve your security, your prosperity and your autonomy within a united Iraq.
We will not leave you".
A change of direction in an ageing China
Wang Weijia and her husband grew up surrounded by propaganda posters that lectured them that "Mother Earth is too tired to entertain more children" and "One more baby means one more grave".
They learned those lessons so well that when government officials in Shanghai, who were suddenly turned on by the low birth rate and the aging population this summer, started to change course and encourage young couples to have more than one child, their answer was immediate and definitive: "No way".
We've already invested all our time and energy in one child.
There is no room left for a second child, said Wang, 31, a human resources manager with an 8-month-old son.
More than 30 years after China's one-child policy, which has produced two generations of notoriously obese, spoiled single children affectionately known as "little emperors", has triggered a population crisis in the country.
The average birth rate has fallen to 1.8 children per couple, compared to 6 when the policy was introduced, according to the UN.
The population of the EU is expected to increase by an average of 0.1% in the next decade, while the number of people aged 60 and over is expected to explode from 16.7% of the population in 2020 to 31.1% by 2050, well above the global average of around 20%.
The imbalance is even greater in wealthy coastal cities with educated populations, like Shanghai.
Last year, people 60 and older made up almost 22 percent of the registered population in Shanghai, while the birth rate was below one child per couple.
Xie Lingli, head of the Shanghai Municipal Population and Family Planning Commission, said that couples of childbearing age must have babies to "help reduce the proportion of the aging population and alleviate future labor shortages".
Shanghai will soon be "as old -- but not as rich -- as the industrialized countries, like Japan and Sweden", she said.
A Progressive Relaxation of the Mind
Enshrined in the country's 1978 constitution, China's one-child policy is arguably the most controversial provision introduced by the ruling Communist Party to date.
Couples who violate this policy face huge fines -- up to three times their annual salary in some regions -- and discrimination at their workplaces.
Chinese officials have credited the policy with avoiding critical strain on the country's natural resources, while human rights advocates have condemned abuses in enforcing the policy.
In rural areas, some officials have forced pregnant women who already had a child to have abortions.
Many couples had also had sex-selective abortions, resulting in an unnaturally high ratio of males to females.
In recent years, government representatives for the population have gradually weakened their stance on the one-child policy.
In 2004, they allowed more exceptions to the rule -- including city dwellers, members of ethnic minorities and cases where both husband and wife were single parents -- and in 2007, the tone of many harsh slogans was toned down.
Qiao Xiaochun, a professor at the Institute of Population Research at Peking University, said that government officials have recently discussed even more radical changes, such as allowing couples to have two children where one partner is an only child.
Shanghai became the first Chinese city to launch an aggressive campaign to promote more births in July.
Posters instructing families to have only one child have been replaced almost overnight by guidelines detailing who is eligible for a second child and how to apply for the permit.
The city has dispatched city employees and family planning volunteers to visit couples at their homes and to shove information leaflets under their doors.
She also asked that psychological and financial counselling be provided for those who have more than one child.
The response was not encouraging, family planning officials said.
Disappointed Reaction
Although officials from a small rural town on the outskirts of Shanghai said there was a surge in applications from couples who want a second child after the campaign began, urban districts reported no change.
In the municipality of Huinan, for example, with a population of 115,000, only four to five applications are still received per month.
Disillusioned Shanghai officials say that the expected number of births in the city for 2010 will still be around 165,000 despite the campaign - slightly higher than in 2009, but lower than in 2008.
Feng Juying, head of the Shanghai Caolu Municipal Family Planning Committee, said that financial considerations are likely the main reason why many people do not want to have more children.
She said they wanted to give their first one the best.
Yang Jiawei, 27, and his wife, Liu Juanjuan, 26, said they would like to have two children and that it is legally allowed.
But like many Chinese, they have only a modest government health and life insurance.
Without a social network, they say, this decision would be irresponsible.
People in the West misinterpret the one-child policy as a human rights issue, said Yang, a civil engineer whose wife is seven months pregnant with her first child.
Yes, they're taking away our ability to have more than one child.
The problem is not simply one of policy.
The problem is money.
Other couples cite psychological reasons for their hesitation.
Wang, the head of human resources, said she only wanted one child because she was an only child. "We were the center of the family and used to everyone taking care of us.
We are not used to caring for others, and we do not really want to".
Chen Zijian, a 42-year-old owner of a translation company, said it bluntly.
For middle-class parents with dual careers, who are seeing birth rates fall, he said, it's all about being successful, and to do that, you have to be selfish.
The 20 to 39 year olds of today grew up seeing their parents struggle during the early days of China's capitalist experiment and they certainly don't want that kind of life for themselves, he said.
Even a single child, he said, takes up a lot of the parents' time.
A mother has to give up her social life for at least two years.
Then there's the question of space -- "You have to rebuild your home" -- and life planning -- "When your child is nine months old, you have to have a resume ready for the best preschools".
Most of his friends are willing to go through this once, Chen said, but not twice.
Our generation is the first to have achieved a higher standard of living, he said.
We don't want to cause too many casualties.
UN group drafts plan to reduce emissions
The UN-sponsored climate conference - which has been characterized by wild poses and mutual blame - has set a new focus on Friday with the publication of a document that sets out an ambitious reduction in greenhouse gases for the next 40 years, with the industrialized nations shouldering the biggest burdens in the near future.
The text, which could provide the basis for a final political agreement on the control of greenhouse gases, has both identified the remaining obstacles and indicated the way forward.
But it was seen as a major breakthrough in a negotiation that is running out of time as more than 100 top politicians from around the world arrive in Copenhagen next week.
The text, drafted by a special UN working group, is silent on the amount of money rich countries should give to poor countries to help them cope with global warming in the short and long term.
It also offers a range of options on the key issues, including how industrialised and large emerging countries can limit their carbon emissions and what the upper limit of global temperature rise policy makers would take into account.
The process will be highly flexible, according to John Coequyt, a senior representative of the Sierra Club in Washington.
Michael Zammit Cutajar, who drafted the six-page document, has compiled a 180-page negotiating text to focus on what the UN's top climate official, Yvo de Boer, has called "the big picture".
It outlines a possible agreement whereby the industrialized nations would collectively reduce their emissions by 25 to 45 percent by 2020 compared to the 1990 limits, while larger developing countries would reduce their emissions by 15 to 30 percent over the same period.
Together, the countries could reduce emissions by 50 to 95 percent by 2050.
The European Community also gave a boost to the talks on Friday by pledging to provide US$ 3.6 billion a year over the next three years to help poorer countries adapt to the effects of climate change, from managing floods and droughts to avoiding deforestation.
The Commission has already made a number of proposals for the creation of a European Union.
US climate change special envoy Todd Stern has rejected language that calls for binding greenhouse gas emission reductions for developed countries, compared to voluntary reductions for larger emerging countries, unless funded by developed nations.
This move heralded a tougher line on China by the Obama administration than the Bush administration took less than two years ago.
The US will not sign the agreement without major emerging countries standing up and taking action, Stern said, complaining that the text does not go far enough to ensure that the cuts can be confirmed by outsiders.
Stern's comments came an hour after Chinese Vice Foreign Minister He Yafei said that the top U.S. climate negotiator was either "unreasonable" or "highly irresponsible" for saying earlier this week that the United States would not provide financial assistance to China to address global warming.
The future economic direction of the great world powers is at stake, and this has led to the emergence of fault lines both within the industrial nations and between the industrial nations and the emerging countries.
The current fight is about saving individual economies as well as saving the planet, with China and the United States fretting about their respective obligations, while poorer countries claim that the two dozen most influential countries would ignore the scientific necessity to take bolder action.
Ricardo Ulate, a delegate from Costa Rica, said it was not surprising that the major powers are fighting over who should bear the cost of curbing greenhouse gas emissions, as even affected countries have moved to be more aggressive in holding the very high-carbon countries accountable for their actions.
This is clearly a game from which a new economic dominance will emerge, said Ulate, who also serves as a regional climate change advisor for Conservation International in Mexico and Central America.
Some of the countries most exposed to the impacts of climate change said they would continue to fight for a legally binding treaty in Copenhagen, although leading participants say the talks will, in the best case, lead to a political agreement.
The 43-member Alliance of Small Island States presented a 24-page draft treaty early Friday morning.
Artur Runge-Metzger, who leads international climate negotiations for the European Commission, said the offensive by small island states is "putting political pressure on the entire political process", in part because they are now united and demanding action from emerging economies such as China and India.
The talks took on new urgency as delegates focused on the fact that most of the open questions still needed to be settled before the government leaders arrived in order to reach an agreement.
High-level officials, like India's environment minister Jairam Ramesh and China's vice minister, got off their planes and raced through the halls of the Bella Center for closed-door meetings and press conferences to hammer out claims that will be negotiated over the next week.
The sheer scale of the gathering -- 13,000 people coming and going in and out of the convention center every day, guitar-playing activists hosting late-night shows where they make fun of the countries that they think are betraying and selling themselves, and contract drafts being hand-to-hand rather than e-mailed -- is already a challenge.
The intensity is just beginning to build: almost all the important ministers are here now and starting on Wednesday, 60 heads of government will be in Copenhagen.
"We are coming to the top league", said Carlos Manuel Rodriguez, vice president of global policy for Conservation International.
The heavyweights are coming.
Britain's first 225 km/h high-speed train redefines the feeling of the day
At 5:13 on Monday morning, a whistle will pierce the darkness to announce a train departure that will revolutionize Britain's transport system.
The first high-speed commuter train in the country will reach 225 km/h from Ashfort, Kent, to London St Pancras, covering 93 km in 38 minutes.
To Lord Adonis, the Minister of Transport, will then go Dame Kelly Holmes, on board the first Javelin shuttle service from London.
He hopes that the new service will eventually link the UK to an international rail network of faster, more reliable trains and connect the large conurbations of the Midlands, the North and Scotland to London.
The neglected province could become vibrant commuter towns, commute times would be radically reduced, and the switch from airplanes and cars to rail would reduce national carbon emissions and road congestion.
In theory, the three major parties believe in this vision.
But the many billions of British pounds required to build a new national railway network, the inevitable planning battle and fears about environmental damage could still put the brakes on Britain's high-speed railways.
High Speed Two (HS2), a company set up in January to provide the government with a feasibility study, will hand over the report to Lord Adonis on 30 December, according to the Times.
This gives him a detailed map of the next planned stage of the high-speed rail network.
The new line, which will connect London with the West Midlands, will run through urban areas and areas where the environmental impact is controversial, with a range of five metres.
In open terrain, the plan will show the concept within 25 metres of the final route.
HS2 is also to create three options for a larger high-speed rail network to the north.
Lord Adonis will respond to this in the spring.
The preferred proposed option is a Y-shaped route, where a single high-speed line would lead to the West Midlands.
The route would divide at or near Birmingham and one branch would run west of the Pennines to Manchester and Scotland and another to the north-east to Sheffield, Leeds and Newcastle upon Tyne.
A single line would lead to Scotland.
"It seems to be the best-performing option", said a railroad insider.
Once completed, the journey time between London and Edinburgh would be reduced to 2 hours 40 minutes.
The first section, which would not be opened until 2025, would enable travellers to complete the London to Birmingham route in 49 minutes, compared with just over an hour today.
The designs would allow trains to run at speeds of 400 km/h, making Britain's railway network the fastest in Europe.
The first track was designed to accommodate trains of 400 metres long and a maximum capacity of 1,100 passengers.
Up to 18 trains could be running per hour on the London-Birmingham route.
This would in turn require a terminal in London to handle 20,000 travellers per hour.
Given the capital's spatial constraints, it is expected that an existing railway station would be expanded to accommodate the high-speed network.
Railway experts say only St Pancras International or Euston have this potential.
Lord Adonis will announce whether or not he thinks this plan should be continued, but the lengthy public consultation and planning means that a final decision will not be taken until after the general election.
But even if he does move the wheels, the rail network will have to be built in sections.
The trains would first have to switch from highspeed lines to existing rail lines north of Birmingham, which would still result in a journey time of over three hours between London and Scotland.
This is considered a crucial junction point to ensure a change from air to rail, a benchmark for the rail revolution.
Taxpayers are coming up for a mortgage on a £ 75,000 conservative orangery .
Alan Duncan, the leading Conservative Member of Parliament, has been charging the taxpayer thousands of pounds a year for the cost of an orangery he has built in his house in his constituency.
The prison party spokesman, demoted by David Cameron for complaining that members of the House of Commons had to live "on meager rations", has raised his mortgage by £75,000 to get an oak-frame addition to his Rutland second home.
He was allowed to charge the taxpayer for the extra interest income, a sum of hundreds of pounds a month.
The House of Commons approved the motions at the time and they were not questioned by Sir Thomas Legg, who is reviewing the expenditure of members of the House of Commons.
Duncan, one of the richest members of the House of Commons, owns a two-storey house in a village in his Rutland and Melton constituency.
Nearby houses have fetched a purchase price of almost one million pounds (1.1 million euros).
The ground floor includes the kitchen, living and dining rooms, but the Fees Office, a spending control unit of the Lower House, has agreed that Duncan needs more space.
Last year, he planted a winter garden, which is called an "orangerie" in the plans.
Neighbors described it as a "glass house for entertainment".
Duncan was also not asked to comment on the increased borrowing during a recent review of his previous mortgage contracts by the Standards and Privileges Committee.
The committee cleared him last month after an investigation of his spending for breaking the rules.
In 2004, Duncan transferred the security for a £271,406 ($320,000) mortgage from his London home to his constituency house, which he had purchased in 1991, a year before his election to Parliament.
Documents released this week show that Duncan was getting about £1,400 a month in mortgage interest payments until March last year.
In April his claims rose to more than £1,800 (€2,000) a month.
The interest rate of Duncan's RBS mortgage did not change during this period, suggesting that the entire increase was used to finance the borrowing of £75,000 (€85,000).
The normal RBS mortgage interest rate without a step decreased from 7,94% in December 2007 to 4% in March this year, where it is still.
The latest House of Commons documents released this May show that Duncan continued to claim his right to £1,250 a month.
Duncan lost his position as Leader of the Opposition in the House of Commons in September after an undercover reporter caught him saying that MPs were "living on meager rations" after the expenses scandal.
"Basically, working for the state means you have to live on meager rations and be treated like a s***".
He said, "I have spent my wealth on my garden, and I have a small share of it.
And I could have claimed the whole damn amount, but I'm not going to".
The MP, a millionaire from his former career as an oil wholesaler, was first attacked for his spending in May, when it emerged that he had demanded thousands of pounds for his garden before he had cleared with the Fees Office that this "could be considered excessive demand".
An activist dug a hole in Duncan's lawn in the shape of a pound sign in protest after it was revealed that he had collected £4,000 (€4,500) over three years.
When asked about the increased mortgage last night, Duncan said, "This was approved by both the Fees Office and subsequently by Legg to increase the value".
He added: "There is no debate about dodging and dodging or bending the rules or anything like that.
Everything is completely transparent and strictly within the rules, is approved and everything.
It couldn't be cleaner and clearer".
Come all you faithful to admire Brighton's seaside hut advent calendar
Beach huts in Brighton have found a new way to spend the winter months as an interactive Advent calendar.
Beyond, an alternative church group that encourages spiritual discovery through creativity, has invited 24 owners to decorate their huts with Christmas carols as a theme for each December Day.
The event started on 1 December and visitors were able to see the newest hut every day from 5:30 to 6:30 pm with free mulled wine and traditional mince pies, pastries filled with dried fruits.
The Christmas songs chosen so far are "I saw three ships", "O come, o come, Emmanuel" and "The first Noël", where the hut decoration is the work of Janette Tozer, a local artist.
Martin Poole, 50, a TV marketing assistant from Hove, is a volunteer minister for the Chichester diocese and head of Beyond.
He said: "We want to make religion more important to people in a post-Christian society.
Why do we as a church expect people to come to a strange old building? I think the church should go to the people and have a celebration that is inspiring.
The idea for the beach hut advent calendar started as a conversation with some friends over dinner.
Brighton is such a fantastic creative and vibrant place and we try to express this through our spirituality".
Strong mobilization in Copenhagen and around the world for the climate.
Tens of thousands of people demonstrated across the world and in Copenhagen on Saturday to demand an ambitious and binding agreement on fighting global warming, where police made several hundred arrests.
At least 30,000 people, according to the police, and 100,000, according to the organisers, marched in the cold of the Danish capital, on the sidelines of the United Nations climate conference, which is due to conclude by Friday and could come into force in 2013.
For Connie Hedegaard, the Danish chair of the climate conference, the growing global mobilization for the climate is a further indication that the "political price" of failure in Copenhagen would be very high.
The incidents in the Danish capital took place shortly after the train passed, when a group of 300 protesters, dressed in all black, smashed shop windows with bricks and hammers, an AFP journalist noted.
Riot police responded immediately and without consideration.
The police have announced that 600 to 700 people, according to your estimation, mostly members of the "blacks blocs", these extremely violent faction groups that have already made themselves famous at the NATO Summit in Strasbourg, were arrested in eastern France in April.
The Coalition Climate Justice Action (CJA), one of the organisers of the demonstration, has sharply criticised the conditions under which hundreds of militant supporters were arrested "without discrimination", and has stressed that about a hundred of them "were still being held in the streets on Saturday night", despite the extreme cold, handcuffed and in a sitting position.
The rather peaceful train left Parliament and headed for the Bella Centre where the negotiations were taking place.
The protesters stopped about 500 meters from the building, without trying to get inside.
A stage was set up to welcome the speakers for a candlelit evening, with the former South African Archbishop, Desmond Tutu, in attendance.
Most of the protesters had travelled by buses and trains from major European cities, but many Asians, including some Chinese and Koreans, were also present, as well as some Africans.
About 3,000 people, most of you in sky blue raincoats, made a first appearance in Copenhagen this morning as you responded to the Friends of the Earth call to form "blue tides" for "climate justice".
Today we are taking to the streets to demand redress of ecological debt in favor of the South, said Lidy Nacpil, a Filipino activist with the Jubilee South Coalition in Copenhagen.
We cannot go on like this and say: we have time, said Angelique Kidjo, a singer from Benin.
There are rivers in Africa that are drying up, streams that you can walk on, like never before in the past.
For the first time in the history of climate diplomacy, which was founded in 1992 with the adoption of the UN Convention, the anti-globalization movement has approached environmental organisations.
MEP José Bové, the face of the globalist movement, announced that he had come to Copenhagen to link "climate justice and social justice": "Today there is no difference between fighting against global warming and fighting for a different world".
The Asia-Pacific region, home to many islands that are particularly vulnerable to warming, has been the launching pad for demonstrations.
Some 50,000 people took to the streets in Australia, according to organizers.
In Manila, there were several hundred people, mostly students, who marched in red and raised bandanas in which you glorified solar energy.
In Hong Kong and Jakarta, as well as in Canada, marches of several hundred demonstrators took place to demand vigorous action against climate change.
In France, the demonstrations organised by the "350" network have gathered several hundred people in Paris, Marseille (south), Lille (north), Bordeaux (west) and Lyon (east).
In Geneva, some people have gathered.
Separatist Abkhazia has elected its president, Georgia denounces it as a "coup".
Abkhazia elected its president on Saturday, a little more than a year after Moscow recognized the pro-Russian separatist Georgian region as independent, denouncing Tbilisi's "strike".
Some 131,000 people were called to participate in the first election after the Russian-Georgian war of August 2008 for control of the South Ossetian region, another Georgian secessionist region that has been recognized by Russia.
The polling stations closed at 17 GMT.
The voter turnout was around 58% a few hours before the polls closed, according to the Abkhaz Election Commission officials.
The first preliminary results were to be announced on the night of Saturday to Sunday.
The five candidates, including the current President, Sergey Bagapch, categorically reject the idea of reunification with Georgia, which condemns the election.
This election is a farce.
The European Union is also calling for the release of the hostages and for the release of the civilians.
Apart from Russia, only Nicaragua and Venezuela have recognised the independence of this area, which has a population of 216,000, while the rest of the world perceives it as part of Georgia, illegally occupied by Russia.
After breaking away from Georgia during the 1992-93 conflict, in which several thousand people died, Abkhazia is seeking to prove by this election that it is ready to join the international community.
"This process is a stage in our new life, a new era, as an independent state", said Svetlana Kvartchia, a 54-year-old historian who claims to have chosen Mr. Bagapch.
She was one of the voters who went to vote in a polling station, which was located in a school in the capital city of Sukhumi, a beautiful white building with a few palm trees in front of the entrance.
The question of Russian dominance is at the heart of this presidential election, in a region of beautiful landscape by the Black Sea.
Large signs showing Bagapch alongside Russian President and Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev and Vladimir Putin are everywhere in this small area of 216,000 inhabitants.
In Gali, in the east of the country, the district chief, Beslan Archba, prepared a warm welcome for the Russian delegation who had come to observe the elections.
We, the Abkhaz people, are grateful, he said at a small celebration, alluding to Moscow's support, particularly in the decision to recognise Abkhazia's independence.
I hope that your country will soon be recognized by the United Nations, replied Alexei Ostrovsky, a member of the Russian parliament, raising a glass of vodka.
The opposition, represented by former vice-president and two Russian businessmen, Zaous Ardzinba and Beslan Boutba, has criticized the agreements reached with Moscow last year, as well as the one in Abkhazia, which gives Russia control of the railway for 10 years.
The fifth candidate, Vitali Banba, claims to support neither the current government nor the opposition.
A majority of 50% plus one vote is necessary to win the election.
If none of the candidates reaches this threshold, a second round of elections must be organised within two weeks.
Climate: Demonstrations around the world, events in Copenhagen
Tens of thousands of people demonstrated across the world on Saturday to demand an ambitious and binding agreement from the Copenhagen climate conference, where police, ready to respond at any time, arrested some 700 people on the sidelines of a major demonstration.
Thirty thousand people, according to the police, and a hundred thousand according to the organizers, demonstrated in the afternoon cold in the Danish capital, which will host delegates from 193 countries until December 18 in search of an agreement that will come into force on January 1, 2013.
From Parliament, the peaceful train marched towards the Bella Centre, where the negotiations are taking place.
The protesters stopped about 500 meters from the center and did not try to break in.
A stage was set up to welcome the speakers for a candlelit evening, with the former South African archbishop, Desmond Tutu, in attendance.
A few moments after the train passed by, a group of protesters dressed in all black and armed with bricks and hammers started smashing windows, an AFP journalist noted.
Riot police immediately surrounded you and intervened without regard, throwing some of you to the ground.
The police have announced that between 600 and 700 people have been arrested and have made it clear that they are mainly members of the "Black Blocs", these extremely violent splinter groups that have already made themselves famous at the NATO Summit in Strasbourg, in eastern France, in April.
In the evening, a policeman was injured in the head by a brick during the incidents, in which, according to the police, about twenty people were arrested provisionally.
"We have the extreme groups under control", said police spokesman Henrik Jakobsen as the helicopters of the police circled in the air.
Most of the protesters who came by train or by private car from major German cities, from London, Amsterdam or Milan, were Europeans.
But there were also many Asians, including Chinese and Koreans, and Africans.
Nearly 3,000 people, mostly in sky-blue raincoats, formed the first group to represent the "blue seas" for "climate justice" in Copenhagen in the morning after the call of the "Friends of the Earth".
"Today we are taking to the streets to demand that the ecological debt be paid to the people of the South", said activist Lidy Nacpil of the Jubilee South Coalition of the Philippines in Copenhagen.
"We can't say to ourselves: 'We have time,'" says the singer Angélique Kidjo from Benin.
"In Africa, there are rivers that dry up, there are watercourses that you can walk through, which was never the case before".
For the first time in the history of climate diplomacy, which was launched in 1992 with the adoption of the UN Convention, the anti-globalisation movement has approached environmental protection organisations.
French MEP and globalist José Bové told AFP he had come to Copenhagen to "link climate justice and social justice". "Today there is no longer any difference between fighting global warming and fighting for another world".
Oxfam has mobilized several figures, such as the Danish model Helena Christensen and the former UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Mary Robinson, who are reaching out to the masses.
The Asia-Pacific region, home to many islands particularly vulnerable to global warming, has been the impetus for the demonstrations.
In Australia, organizers said that some 50,000 people took to the streets.
In Manila, several hundred people, mostly students, dressed in red and wearing red bandanas, advertised for solar energy in front of the Philippine capital's city hall.
Hundreds of protesters have also gathered in Hong Kong and Jakarta to protest climate change.
In France, several hundred people joined in the demonstrations organized by the "Network of 350", particularly in Paris, Marseille in the south, Lille in the north, Bordeaux in the west and Lyon in the east.
In Geneva, several people gathered.
The subjects of geography and history, according to Chatel, are strongly influenced by the reform of the lycées.
The Minister of National Education, Luc Chatel, stated in an interview published in the Sunday newspaper Journal du dimanche that the subjects of geography and history are strongly supported by the reform of the lycées, even though they are not taught in the Terminale (12th year).
"The students of the Première (11th year) now have all four hours a week and the same programme", Mr Chatel confirms.
The Minister said that "this hypocrisy must be overcome", because according to him "the scientific profile is no longer a scientific profile" but, on the whole, a concentration of "the best students".
"The socioeconomic and literary profile (ES and L) must not become a sub-profile of the scientific", he continued, stressing that "I have not yet heard many historians and intellectuals who have complained about the lack of historical-geographical education in the Terminale at technical lycées".
On Saturday, an IFOP poll published in Humanité revealed that almost seven out of ten French people (69%) are critical of the government's plan to abolish compulsory history and geography lessons in Terminale S (school year 12 with a scientific profile).
The Minister replied that there was no question of limiting the philosophy of the Terminal S programme.
Luc Chatel also defended the reform of the education system for teachers, while 16 organisations (students and trade unions) called for a protest on Tuesday against the project, which they believe will harm the pedagogical training of future teachers.
The Minister explained that in Master 2 (M2) they undergo a subject-related aptitude test at the beginning of the year and an entrance examination at the end of the year, which tests their teaching skills.
They also carry out traineeships during the year in M2 and then teach as trainees for a year before the pupils.
He went on to say: "If you add up all the internships offered before the exam, you get even more hours spent in front of the students, i.e. more than 300 hours".
The Minister finally stated that he wanted to offer "the individual right to education" - a "thing that does not exist in popular education".
He confirmed that he wants to abolish the school card "by 2012".
15 minutes for the climate at the Ecole Normale Supérieure
Fifteen minutes to talk about the Copenhagen Summit: this is the challenge faced by Jean Jouzel, Vice-President of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, at the Ecole Normale Supérieure in the Rue d'Ulm in Paris on Saturday morning.
As one AFP journalist noted, Nobel Peace Prize winner Jean Jouzel opened the first of the "Ernest" conferences, in which experts address the audience with fifteen minutes of filmed speeches.
"We want to do something that reaches people and makes them feel like they want to learn more", said Edardou Hannezo, 22, one of the organizers of the day, which is named after the fish that students named in the school's pool.
'The 20 or so experts were selected for the discussions, also on the basis of their charisma,' he says.
"You can talk for hours about global warming, but you can also talk about nuclear targets in minutes", Jean Jouzel told AFP, speaking to about 50 people using only slides.
'This is part of our role as scientists,' he said, hoping that the audience would learn that 'the Copenhagen conference is based on a scientific dossier of the utmost seriousness'.
The videos from these conferences will be available online on the school website from 15 December.
The next "Ernest" day is planned for February and will be held every two months thereafter.
Delayed payment: angry prison warden, action planned
The prison officers' unions have called for a general day of action on Friday to ensure that the bonuses and overtime paid, which were postponed until January for budgetary reasons, are transferred before the Christmas holidays.
The prisoners' union (FO-Pénitentiaire) called on non-duty prisoners to demonstrate and blockade the prison on Tuesday morning to draw attention to the "theft of what is theirs".
The CGT Penitentiary Workers' Union called for "strong mobilisation in the various prisons" and branded the non-payment of overtime in October, night-time pay and Sunday and holiday pay in December as "shameful and unacceptable".
The first prison officers' union, the Autonomous Federal Penal Institutions Union (UFAP/UNSA), called for "general mobilizations (...) to show dissatisfaction and anger".
The prison administration and the Ministry of Justice said that overtime was increased significantly in 2009 and not all of it was budgeted, but they guarantee that the remaining claims will be paid in January.
The Ministry of Justice announced that evening that Michèle Alliot-Marie had sent a letter to the prison officials' unions, guaranteeing that the payment would be made next month.
"I am very aware of the efforts of the staff to keep our prison system functional and to modernise it", the Minister of Justice said in the letter.
"I have instructed the management of the prison to take immediate action to ensure that such a situation, which has arisen from a lack of appreciation of the overtime required, does not happen again in the future", added Ms Alliot-Marie.
The December pay is therefore very low, except for the management staff, who enjoy high service and target bonuses, explains UFAP/UNSA, for whom "budget constraints" must be respected.
"This is an absolute scandal", said the interregional union FO in Marseille, announcing that it would boycott "all meetings and conventions" until further instructions.
"The staff will not go to work on Sundays and public holidays if the hours from October to December are still unpaid, and the same applies to their overtime", the FO Rhône-Alpes-Auvergne also threatens.
"In an age where we are being charged with more and more tasks without hiring more staff, it is more than inappropriate to try to enrich ourselves with staff funds", says the CGT union of Bordeaux.
The unions say that the situation is not the same in all regions, some being less affected than others.
But in any case, it is wrong, says Jean-François Forget, Secretary-General of the UFAP.
Obama thinks he always gives out better presents than he gets.
US President Barack Obama, who will be spending Christmas with his family for the first time in the White House, has joked to TV talk show host Oprah Winfrey that he always gives out better gifts than he gets.
In a special broadcast Sunday night on ABC, the president and his wife, Michelle, gave a glimpse of how they will spend the holidays in their newly-illustrated home.
Even Bo, the little four-legged companion of the family, will be joining the party.
"Santa Claus loves Bo too", Michelle Obama said, adding that the dog will also receive a gift.
Michelle Obama strongly denied her husband's claims about the quality of the gifts. "I gave you nice gifts last year", she teases the president.
"So, please", he said, angrily, pointing to the First Lady's pearl necklace, "and who gave you this?"
During this one-hour, casual broadcast with the well-known television host who had been such a strong supporter of Barack Obama during his campaign, the president and his wife also talked about the gifts they had loved most as children.
Barack Obama remembered a ten-speed bicycle and a basketball that his father, whom he rarely saw, had brought him from Kenya for Christmas.
"I remember my father visiting us one Christmas and bringing me a basketball", said the president.
"It wasn't until much later in my life that I realized that I had this ball from him".
The first lady remembered her dollhouse.
"I didn't know how to put the furniture in a house, so I put them all on the wall instead of grouping them around the fireplace, but I loved this little dollhouse", said Michelle Obama.
Johnny Hallyday is having surgery again, RTL confirms he's been put into a medically induced coma
Johnny Hallyday was operated on again in Los Angeles for significant "damage" following an operation in France. According to people close to him, the situation is "under control", although RTL confirms that the singer was put into an artificial coma to avoid pain and complications.
The 66-year-old rock musician underwent a second operation at Cedars-Sinaï Hospital in Los Angeles on Wednesday night after American doctors diagnosed "damage from the operation of a herniated disc" he had suffered in Paris on November 26, according to his Paris production company, which added that the damage would have required a second operation.
The singer's production company, however, wanted to make it clear that the situation was "under control" and said that a new medical report would be available within 48 hours.
However, according to RTL, the singer's partner during the last tour, Johnny Hallyday was placed in an artificial coma to avoid "pain and complications".
However, it took 48 hours for the patient's condition to be confirmed, when he opened his eyes, RTL added.
There was no confirmation or comment from the production company at the request of the AFP.
RTL also confirms that 'certain sources' indicate that 'no drainage' was installed after its first operation in Paris.
The rocker had been operated on for a herniated disc at the international clinic at Parc Monceau.
The operation, planned for several days, was performed by neurosurgeon Stéphane Delajoux, a renowned doctor who had treated many stars.
He was not available for comment to RTL on Thursday evening.
Following the surgery on Johnny Hallyday, the singer was admitted Monday to Cedars-Sinaï Hospital in Los Angeles due to a post-operative infection.
Singer Eddy Mitchell, who is very close to Johnny Hallyday, told RTL on Thursday that his friend was going through a "deep valley". However, he assured that there was "no need to worry" about the rock musician, as he was "a good fighter".
"He had called me before he was due to fly to Los Angeles, and I told him it was nonsense to get on a plane 12 hours after such an operation, that's not how it works", said Eddy Mitchell.
On Wednesday night, the singer's producer, Jean-Claude Camus, confirmed that Johnny Hallyday "is responding well to the antibiotics" and that "the infection is contained".
Mr Camus also said that he had spoken to Laeticia, the singer's wife, and that he had not felt any particular anxiety.
However, concern over the singer's health had been growing since he spent nine days in hospital in July after a crash on his yacht.
Two months later, to the general astonishment of the public, it was announced that Johnny Hallyday had undergone a "small operation for colon cancer", followed by a mild infection.
At the end of September, the singer recorded his long "Tour 66" as planned as a farewell tour.
Since then, however, every health issue has been extensively commented upon, and fans and journalists have not missed the fact that the singer had difficulty moving on stage.
It was not until mid-November that the people around him had to be hospitalized again.
Euro 2009: Bousquet takes first place in his favourite distance
Frenchman Frédérick Bousquet, a three-time medalist at the 2009 World Championships, won an international title on Thursday in his favourite distance, the 50m freestyle, at the Euro 2009 on the short course in Istanbul.
On the first day of this competition, the last time polyurethane suits were allowed, there were only three world records, while a veritable record flood was expected.
One record was bettered by Hungarian Evelyn Verraszto over 4 x 200 m relays and the other two by Russia in men's 4 x 50 m relays.
The loss was a blow to Bousquet, who was trying to take the world record in the 50m freestyle, which he holds in the large pool (20.94).
In one of the two King's Distances in swimming, the 50m freestyle, the 28-year-old Frenchman claimed the title in 20.53 seconds, in a final with ten swimmers at the start (usually there are eight) - a first at international level.
Bousquet beat the Croatian Duje Draganja (20.70) and the Russian Sergey Fesikov (20.84), but he did not manage to break the world record (20.30) as planned.
"You can always hope for something bigger and in this case I said if the world record is within my reach, I'll try".
Like Bousquet, almost all swimmers started in polyurethane suits, which are banned from 1 January 2010.
With 238 world records since February 2008, these combinations end their epic in Istanbul, which began in 1999 at the same competition.
The combination didn't pay off for German Paul Biedermann, two-time world champion in Rome this summer and world record holder.
The young swimmer failed to improve on his best time over 400m freestyle (3:32.77), but he still won with the second best time in his career (3:34.55), ahead of Russian Nikita Lobintsev (3:35.75) and Danish Mads Glaesner (3:36.82).
"I didn't give it my all this time.
I knew I couldn't set a world record today, but I defended my title and did my job".
"Lobintsev will be a serious opponent in the future", explained Biedermann.
USA: Zola's tombstone is estimated at $1.5 million
A Roman tombstone discovered in the possession of French writer Emile Zola was valued at $1.5 million over its original value on Thursday, according to art dealer Sotheby's.
This slab is six feet long and two feet high, and it dates from the third century C.E. It has always been valued at $150,000 to $250,000.
The marble, which "represents four scenes of Dionysus in sophisticated architectural decoration surrounded by satyr and Bacchus figures, is a rare piece, there are only four or five of them in the world", Florent Heintz, vice president of Roman and Egyptian antiquities at Sotheby's, told AFP on Tuesday.
It was sold in less than a hundred pieces.
"The sale is still on, but this is certainly the piece that buyers have bid the most for so far", Sotheby's spokesman Dan Abernethy told AFP.
The discovery of this marble piece by Emile Zola goes back a long way.
The plate was kept in Rome for almost 300 years in the famous Borghese family collection, then it appeared piece by piece in the bathroom of the French actress Cécile Sorel, who used it in her Paris hotel, and in the bathroom of Paul Reynaud, minister in the Third French Republic and president of the Council before Marshal Pétain came to power.
The next 50 years are in the dark.
While searching the Louvre's database, Florent Heintz discovered that this plate was part of an "Emile Zola legacy" opened in 1903, a year after the death of the author of "Thérèse Raquin" and the fresco "Rougon-Macquart".
Zelaya's attempt to leave Honduras for Mexico has been foiled
On Thursday, Mexico declared the conditions for the transfer of the deposed Honduran president Manuel Zelaya to domestic soil no longer acceptable, after the latter rejected the coup government's escort as unacceptable.
After a late-night phone call with President Zelaya, there seems to be a disagreement about how to carry out the transfer, said Mexico's Foreign Minister Patricia Espinosa.
According to the immigration department, the plane, which was chartered by the Mexican government and arrived in Salvador on Wednesday to transfer Mr. Zelayas, returned to its place of departure.
The coup government wanted to force Mr Zelaya to "resign" and to seek political asylum for him abroad under escort.
The deposed president, however, refused to do so, wishing to return to Mexico as the most welcome incumbent head of state.
The coup regime "has failed again by trying to get me to resign at my expense (...), they wanted me to resign", Zelaya told Radio Globo on Thursday, in which he has been a frequent speaker since the beginning of the political crisis that has lasted five months in the Central American country.
I can stay here for ten years, here is my guitar, added the deposed president, who had fled to the Brazilian embassy in Tegucigalpa two and a half months ago, with a few strokes of the chord.
The Mexican embassy has asked us to accompany it, but unfortunately we cannot accept it because it does not include a request for asylum, Oscar Raul Matute, the interior minister of the coup government, told Honduran radio HRN on Wednesday.
The EU is also calling for the release of the hostages, and for the release of the hostages.
The President of the Republic of Honduras, Mr Gonzalez, had said that he would only leave Honduras if he was the President of the Honduran people.
The rumors of Mr Zelaya's departure had on Wednesday mobilized the supporters of the deposed president, who had gathered around the Brazilian embassy, whereupon the military there had stepped up its efforts.
Brazilian Foreign Minister Celso Amorim criticized the position of the coup government.
This, he said, revealed the marginal character of this government in the face of international standards.
Zelaya, who had been close to the socialist Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez, was overthrown on June 28, the day of the referendum he organized to prepare his re-election, against the advice of the Supreme Court, the army and the Congress.
He had returned from exile in Costa Rica on September 21 and had sought refuge in the Brazilian embassy.
If he leaves, he will be arrested for high treason, which he is accused of by the judiciary, according to the coup government.
The coupled President Roberto Micheletti has succeeded in organising a presidential election on 29 November to replace M. Zelaya.
The United States has recognized Porfirio Lobo in the course of the disputed election, but Latin American countries such as Venezuela, Argentina and Brazil have rejected him.
Three days later, the Congress voted overwhelmingly against Mr Zelaya's return to office until the end of his term on 27 January.
Wall Street on the rise, US trade balance fuels optimism
The New York Stock Exchange closed on Thursday with a high, the figures of the American trade balance show a recovery in the prices of the United States and their partners: the Dow Jones rose by 0.67%, the Nasdaq by 0.33%.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose from 68.78 to 10,405.83 points, according to the stock market closing figures, while the Nasdaq, dominated by technology, rose from 7.13 to 2,190.06 points.
The Standard & Poor's 500 extended index was written down by 0.58 % (6.40 points) to 1,102.35 points.
There is good news from various sectors, said Lindsey Piegza of FTN Financial.
This is an anecdote, however, given that the market is only focused on 'half-full glasses', she said.
According to Peter Cardillo of Avalon Partners, investors are primarily focused on the US trade balance figures, "which show an improvement in activity in the fourth quarter".
The United States trade deficit fell by 7.6% to $32.9 billion in October compared with September.
The analysts, on the contrary, had expected a deficit increase.
Both imports and exports have increased.
The big news is the increase in the total volume of trade, especially in goods exports, reflecting the economic growth of the United States' main trading partners, commented Christopher Cornell of the business research site Economy.com.
In contrast, unemployment claims in the United States have risen against expectations in the past week, reaching 474,000.
However, the average number of new job seekers during the past four weeks "has fallen to its lowest point of the year", said Scott Marcouiller of Wells Fargo Advisors.
The bond market has gone down.
The yield on 10-year government bonds rose to 3.482%, compared with 3.432% on Tuesday evening, and the yield on 30-year bonds rose to 4.492% compared with 4.408% on the previous evening.
Cuba: Hundreds of ruling partisans blow the whistle of "Ladies in White"
On Thursday, several hundred partisans in power in Cuba attacked the wives of political prisoners who had gathered in Havana for the World Day of Human Rights and also disrupted another rally, which resulted in the temporary arrest of a dozen or so dissidents.
Around forty "Ladies in White", wives or close relatives of political prisoners, were booed in the open by partisans of the government of Raul Castro, just as they were marching into the center of the capital to demand the release of the political prisoners, an AFP journalist confirmed.
Down with the Yankees! "Mercenaries!" "The street belongs to the revolutionaries!" "Long live Fidel and Raul!" the empowered partisans chanted with raised fists towards the dissidents.
The latter were escorted by civilian agents who had appeared to "ensure their protection".
A similar demonstration against the Ladies in White was held in Havana the previous evening, but no one was injured or arrested.
In the Vedado district, a dozen dissidents who were also attending Thursday's International Human Rights Day demonstration were temporarily detained by civilian police, an AFP reporter confirmed.
The police forcefully forced dissidents who had been detained by government partisans to board civilian vehicles, according to the journalist.
Temporary detention of dissidents in such circumstances is usually limited to a few hours.
As candidates for the European Parliament's 2005 Sakharov Prize, the Ladies in White organized an unauthorized march to "Ask for the release of all political prisoners" which, according to the dissident list, includes some 200 people, said Laura Pollan, one of the leaders whose husband Hector Maceda is serving a 20-year prison sentence.
Mr Maceda is one of the 75 Cuban dissidents jailed in March 2003, 53 of whom are still behind bars.
The Cuban authorities see the opponents of the regime as "mercenaries" or "agents" in the service of the declared arch-enemy, the United States.
A rarity in itself is that the Cuban television reported on the demonstration events that took place on Thursday between militant pro-government fighters and "counter-revolutionaries".
Cuba, which is led by a single party, the Communist Party, is regularly accused by European or American NGOs of violating rights and freedoms, in particular freedom of expression.
A maniac kills an 80-year-old with a knife and leaves five wounded in Clichy-la-Garenne .
A maniac armed with two knives killed an eighty-year-old man and injured five others in the city of Clichy-la-Garenne (Hauts-de-Seine) late Friday afternoon during the main business hours.
According to initial reports, the 28-year-old attacker had wounded the 80-year-old for an as yet unknown reason in or outside a pharmacy on Boulevard Jean-Jaures with two knives and this, according to police, in the presence of witnesses.
The old man, born in 1929, according to a representative of the Alliance police syndicate, died in hospital as a result of his injuries.
In or outside the same pharmacy, he's got a couple with a pregnant woman.
The man, about thirty, intervened and was injured.
The first two victims were taken to hospital with serious injuries, where the 80-year-old died.
The other man is in critical condition, with vital organs apparently affected, according to police sources.
The pregnant woman has been sick as a result of the events and has been hospitalized in a "state of shock", according to a police source.
The armed man, who according to police appeared to be under the influence of alcohol or drugs, is said to have immediately escaped onto the street, the flat Boulevard Jean Jaures.
He injured two other passers-by, apparently by accident: a man in his thirties and a man in his forties, the latter of the two seriously.
The scenario was kept in the dark in the evening.
He was armed with two butcher knives, which he carried crossed behind his back, said Arnaud Pressé, a member of the Alliance syndicate in the Hauts-de-Seine region.
According to witnesses gathered by the AFP, several passers-by, including teenagers, tried to restrain the madman.
I saw a guy in a three-piece with a green vest.
Three youths tried to enter.
They didn't make it because the guy was well-built, reported Alberto, a waiter at a nearby bar.
A horde attacked him, he added, including a city policeman who broke his wrist.
Still on Boulevard Jean-Jaures, at the level of house number 61, two municipal police officers, including their superior, tried to arrest the armed man and were wounded with knife blades, according to police information.
The incident took place in one of the main arteries of Clichy-la-Garenne, where a number of shops are located.
Passersby approached me to tell me that there's an injured person outside.
I went outside and saw a 70-year-old person lying on the floor, I put him in the first aid position and noticed a gaping wound in the stomach area, said Frédéric Allione, a 35-year-old pharmacist, to AFP.
Five minutes later, a second person, about thirty years old, came in with cuts.
State police forces finally arrested the man who was not carrying any identification papers.
The prosecutor's office of Nanterre has instructed the district office of the criminal police of Hauts-de-Seine (SDPJ 92) to investigate the case.
The lunatic was admitted to hospital on Thursday night.
Given his condition, he has not yet been tried in court.
A police source doesn't rule out a mental hospital.
According to another police source, six officers were called to restrain him at the police station in Clichy, where he had been taken.
He was "in a state of over-excitement" like "all the mentally confused of this kind, in whom the forces are released during the passage of the Tathers".
USA: Polanski's lawyer again calls for the prosecution to be stopped
The lawyer for French-Polish filmmaker Roman Polanski has repeatedly called on Thursday in Los Angeles (California, western United States) to drop the prosecution against his client, who is currently on trial in his home in Switzerland for a moral offence committed more than 30 years ago.
Chad Hummel, lawyer for the director of The Pianist, has testified before three judges of the Second District of California Court of Appeal about gross miscarriages of justice during the trial in 1977.
I am asking for a reprieve immediately,' Mr Hummel said, before adding that the behaviour of Judge Laurence Rittenband, who was handling the case at the time, 'was a bit of a shock'.
According to him, before the judge, the late Judge Rittenband, delivered his verdict, he had a discussion with a prosecutor who told him that Roman Polanski deserved to be imprisoned - which was a serious procedural error.
This discussion was raised in the documentary "Roman Polanski: wanted and desired", by the prominent prosecutor David Wells.
Mr Wells had finally declared at the end of September that the authors of the documentary had "lied".
If the Court refuses to dismiss the criminal proceedings, Mr Hummel requests that a trial be held which would enable him to present the evidence in support of his argument.
The prosecution, for its part, has repeated the line of evidence already explained at first instance, i.e. that a discussion to set aside the facts against the accused cannot be seriously considered as long as Roman Polanski does not appear in court.
The 76-year-old director had fled the United States in 1978, before the conviction for "illegal sexual relations" with a minor of 13 years.
He hasn't been back to the States since.
Los Angeles County Deputy District Attorney Phyllis Asayama had stated that Roman Polanski "must be there to witness the trial".
"Do you want to spread the message in this case, not just to (Roman Polanski) but to other defendants, that escape is a way out?" asks Ms Asayma.
In their view, "the filmmaker is asking the court for a favor and thus disregards its authority".
One of the three judges  who now have 90 days to announce their decision  even emphasised "that there are other alternatives to escape".
Hummel was not the only one who had asked for the prosecution of Roman Polanski to be suspended.
The lawyer of Samantha Geimer, the victim, also demanded the suspension of the criminal proceedings.
She reminded her client that she could no longer tolerate being harassed by any re-emergence of the Polanski affair, adding: "No one in this room can say that this process was fair.
Thirty-two years is enough".
Roman Polanski was arrested in Switzerland on September 26th, on an American arrest warrant.
After spending two months behind bars, he was sentenced to house arrest in his chalet in Gstaad, in anticipation of possible extradition.
Wall Street is being held back by the dollar's rise and closing at zero.
The New York Stock Exchange closed on Friday with no price, in a market torn between better than expected US indicators and a rise in the dollar: the Dow Jones gained 0.63%, while the Nasdaq lost 0.03%.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average, based on the final figures available at closing, rose 65.67 points to 10,471.50 points, while the technology-dominated Nasdaq lost 0.55 points to 2,190.31 points.
The S&P 500 index increased by 0.37% (4.06 points) to 1.106.41 points.
"To be honest, the market is pretty quiet", noted Mace Blicksilver of Marblehead Asset Management.
"It remains tight, the volume of trade has become very low and I think it will remain so until the end of the year".
The trend was supported by the publication of better-than-expected economic indicators, which "have helped to improve the market's view of the strength of the recovery", the Charles Schwab analysts concluded.
In the USA, retail sales increased by 1.3% in November, two months in a row and far more than expected.
The US consumer confidence also improved significantly in December, to 73.4 from 67.4 in the previous month, according to the University of Michigan's Index Forecast.
However, the indices were slowed down by a new rise in the dollar, which has reached its highest level against the euro for two months, pushing down 'sectors vulnerable to the economic situation', said Owen Fitzpatrick, Deutsche Bank.
The technological values have lost ground.
The bond market has gone down.
The yield on the 10-year Treasury bond rose by 3,540%, compared with 3,482%, and the yield on the 30-year bond rose to 4,497%, compared with 4,492% the previous day.
Miss World again in South Africa
After a month-long tour of South Africa, the 112 Miss World contestants will cross the final hurdle on Saturday to realize their dream of being voted the most beautiful woman in the world in front of a billion television viewers.
Five of them have already secured their place in the semi-finals of this major beauty fair, which is being held in the Johannesburg area for the second time in a row.
Miss Japan Eruza Sasaki, Perla Beltran Acosta from Mexico, Mariatu Kargbo from Sierra Leone, Kaiane Aldorino from Gilbratar and Yanbing Ma from Canada were crowned Miss Sportive or Miss Topmodel during their stay in Africa.
This was a veritable whirlwind of pleasure.
Touring beautiful cities, such as Port Elizabeth, Durban and Cape Horn, was simply extraordinary.
I have seen many things and had many experiences! said Miss Sierra Leone enthusiastically.
This competition will be the ninth to be held in South Africa and will be broadcast live from Midrand, north of Johannesburg, on Saturday, starting at 5pm (15pm CET).
I can't think of a more beautiful place to give my crown.
It was a fascinating experience.
I'm happy to have had this experience twice, underlined Miss World Ksenia Sukhinova in the heat of the South African summer.
For the young Russian, her second stay in South Africa was marked by numerous exchanges of experience with the candidates and the rediscovery of "stunning landscapes".
After a month of gala, auditions, press conferences and safari, the Miss is now focusing on the competition.
Pooja Chopra, from India, hopes to follow in the footsteps of Priyanka Chopra, who was elected in 2000 and will be present at this election, and Aishwarya Rai, who was elected in 1994 and both became Bollywood stars.
Of course, it is every woman's dream to be crowned the most beautiful woman in the world, but it's not just about looks.
We are ambassadors of our country and I want to come home with the crown, Miss India throws in a wide smile.
According to the organizers, this 59th edition will be highlighted with music and dance.
The candidates will be in traditional costumes and, not to be forgotten, in swimming trunks.
The show will be hosted by Chinese television host Angela Chow, South African former beauty queen Michelle McLean and Miss World committee chair Steve Douglas.
South Africa has shown that it knows how to welcome the world with a warmth and pride that are second to none, assures Miss World's chairwoman Julia Morley.
The candidates have, as last year, taken a safari touring the famous township in Soweto, but this time they have tried the bicycle and the local cuisine.
The most extraordinary thing, however, was the meeting with the South African President, Mr Jacob Zuma, who shook hands with them.
Not unusual for a head of state, Miss Sierra Leone remarked.
But her fondest memory is undoubtedly the draw in Cape Town (southwest) for the World Cup in June 2010, a way for the country to promote the event.
I'm mixed up with people I'd probably never get close to otherwise.
I will certainly return for the 2010 World Cup, enthusiastically promised Miss Italy, Alice Taticchi.
The news about Johnny Hallyday is "very positive", according to his son David.
The news about Johnny Hallyday is "very positive", his son David assured on Friday upon his arrival at Los Angeles airport to visit his father, who has been in hospital there for several days.
The news is very positive.
He is very strong, everything is going very well, David Hallyday told the press as he stepped off the plane, which arrived from Paris shortly after 1 p.m. local time (21 a.m. CET).
The son of the singer, who appeared relaxed, assured that he would go "as quickly as possible" to the hospital Cedars-Sinaï, where Johnny Hallyday was admitted on Monday for a bacterial infection after surgery for a herniated disc on November 26 in Paris.
The singer was "put into an artificial coma in Los Angeles this night to relieve his severe pain and to be able to carry out his treatment, the press service announced.
Johnny Hallyday was placed in an induced coma by doctors at Cedars-Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles, where he was admitted Monday due to a bacterial infection following a herniated disc surgery on November 26 in Paris.
The singer had to undergo another operation in the night from Wednesday to Thursday because of the morbid changes caused by the last operation.
His wife Laeticia attended a school event at the French high school in Los Angeles on Friday morning, where their daughter Jade is attending school, an AFP photographer noted.
The head of orthopedic and traumatology surgery at the Hôpital Pitié-Salpêtrière, Yves Catoné, announced that he would visit the singer on Monday at the hospital in Los Angeles.
The producer has put a heavy burden on the neurosurgeon Dr. Stephane Delajoux, who operated on the singer on November 26th at the Clinique Internationale du Parc Monceau in Paris.
We were told that he had committed the most heinous massacre.
The surgeons from Los Angeles said they were "totally outraged", Mr. Camus explained.
I have heard that a possible legal action will be taken, he said.
Jean-Claude Camus believes that Johnny Hallyday "traveled to Los Angeles much too quickly and with the permission of the Paris surgeon".
I personally spoke to the doctor on the phone, who assured me that he considered this trip to be completely unproblematic, which was very surprising to me, since I had already had two operations on my herniated disc, he added.
Shortly before, he announced on RTL that the singer had apparently left the hospital after the operation "without drainage, without everything".
Dr. Stéphane Delajoux is well known in the artistic circles.
He had operated on the actress Marie Trintignant in Vilnius a few days before her death, at a clinic in Neuilly-sur-Seine where he was practicing at the time.
In 2007, he also operated on actress Charlotte Gainsbourg to resorbe a hematoma after a brain hemorrhage.
But he is also a doctor with a dubious reputation, having been convicted several times for botched surgeries and, not to mention, for tax evasion and fraud.
Mr Olivier Metzner, lawyer for the medical association, described him as "a man without scruples" who had to answer "regularly" to the board of directors and who "was anything but commendable".
After a few days of silence, Dr. Stéphane Delajoux made a statement on Friday through his lawyer, Mr. David Koubbi.
He stated that the surgery had "gone perfectly" and that the post-operative examinations had been "normal".
The operation "did not produce any bleeding and therefore did not require any drainage", he added.
In any case, the tour of the singer, whose health problems have been increasing since last summer, seems to be in question.
It is quite clear that the tour is a little short for a continuation on 8 January (in Amiens), Mr Camus explained.
The UDF (Union for French Democracy) is strongly calling on the Nouveau Centre party to stop using its seal
The alliance of parties overseen by François Bayrou's MoDem party on Friday reacted strongly to an attempt by the Nouveau Centre party chairman Hervé Morin to take over the seal of the party once founded by Valéry Giscard d'Estaing, and urged him, under threat of legal action, not to use this seal on any document.
Hervé Morin publicly announces his intention to take over this UDF seal, as he believes that François Bayrou would not be worthy to defend this political heritage after having reached out to the left.
The Minister of Defence, whose party is the UMP, wanted to reaffirm this strategy on Saturday before the National Council of the NC.
In support of his efforts, he had received the support of the Member of Parliament Hervé de Charette (formerly UMP, now NC), who claims ownership of the UDF mark, having been the first to apply for that mark in 2004 at the 'Institut national de la propriété industrielle'.
However, the office of the UDF, the alliance of parties overseen by the friends of François Bayrous, broke the silence and made it clear that they would not allow themselves to be expropriated and set the Minister and the Member of Parliament a deadline, under threat of legal action, to no longer use this seal and to transfer the ownership rights of the trademark to them.
You have made numerous statements in recent days that you would propose to your political movement to adopt the UDF seal ++, the alliance of parties wrote in a letter signed by 19 of the 24 members of the bureau, including François Bayrou and Marielle de Sarnez, of the MoDem party, and Senator Jean Arthuis of the centrist alliance.
You also thought that you had the right to have the name of this movement, the slogan of the current UDF, printed on your political material and on the home page of your website.
As you know, you have no right to use this seal, the office of the UDF explained and called on the party NC to "immediately remove the mention of the name of the UDF from all material and from (its) website".
In addition, Hervé de Charette was required to 'transfer the ownership of the mark to its legal successors'.
If you refuse, we will take legal action against you to ensure respect for the law and to defend the legitimate rights of UDF members, the signatories warned.
In their letter, they stress that the UDF has been a full-fledged political movement since 1978 and recall that Morin and his friends "made the choice" to leave it in 2007 to form a rival movement, as others had already done in 2002 to form the UMP party.
The Nouveau Centre party therefore has no right to use the UDF (Union for French Democracy) seal.
They also recall that the last UDF congress in 2007 approved the three-year membership of the MoDem party and the creation of a bureau to defend 'the material and moral interests' of the movement founded by Valéry Giscard d'Estaing.
As for Hervé de Charette, the Office continues, 'he had not been a member of the UDF for three years when he applied for the trade name' but had become a member of the UMP.
He profits in a scandalous and fraudulent manner from the lack of the deposit of the acronym UDF to do this for himself.
They also point out that this recklessness is on the way to becoming a crime, and they ironically point out the NC's strategy: "It seems more dignified to us, in politics as in life, to make a name for oneself rather than to try to escape anonymity by fraudulently acquiring a name to which one has no legal claim".
The Affaire Liliane Bettencourt: François-Marie Banier is convicted of exploiting the weak
The Court of Justice of Nanterre decided on Friday to try the artist François-Marie Banier to determine whether, as the daughter of the billionaire Liliane Bettencourt claims, he took advantage of a weak moment of the eighty-year-old to steal part of her fortune.
The 62-year-old photographer, known for his star photos, will appear in court on April 15 and 16, 2010 for exploiting weakness, a crime punishable by a maximum three-year prison sentence and a fine of 375,000 euros.
This decision means that there will indeed be a trial in this affair worthy of the saga of one of the richest families in France, in which mother and daughter are fighting and at the same time holding the reins of the L'Oréal cosmetics empire.
The 15th Criminal Chamber has also ordered a medical examination of Liliane Bettencourt, 87, which will be carried out jointly by three doctors.
The heiress and main shareholder of L'Oréal has so far refused to submit to such an investigation, especially under the conditions laid down by the Nanterre public prosecutor's office during the investigation.
The doctors appointed on Friday are to submit a report before 10 March 2010 clearly stating whether and at what times Liliane Bettencourt may have been in a state of weakness.
I think she's going to submit to these tests.
I will speak to her, said Mrs Bettencourt's lawyer, Mr Georges Kiejman, after the hearing.
As for the lawyer of Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers, Me Olivier Metzner, he is very satisfied with the decision of the Court.
This is excellent news (...).The expert opinion will prove that he (Banier) manipulated this old lady who must be protected, he affirmed.
For two years, Liliane Bettencourt's only daughter has brought a criminal complaint against François-Marie Banier, a photographer and all-around artist, accusing him of exploiting her mother's weakness for years to steal gifts totalling one billion euros in the form of bank checks, insurance policies or paintings.
Liliane Bettencourt, for her part, had always denied having been manipulated by the photographer, whom she considered a long-time friend.
Although the Court would have to examine the admissibility of the action brought by Mrs Bettencourt-Meyers, the lawyers' pleadings on Friday have led to a major family debacle.
In that regard, Liliane Bettencourt's lawyer relied on three letters sent to her notary by her client (1999, 2003 and 2005), in which she wrote that she distrusted the husband of Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers.
According to her lawyer, Liliane Bettencourt added: "Could you please explain to my daughter that I wrote to Banier once or twice a day for 15 years.
Françoise, I haven't been able to speak to her since she got married".
The Nanterre prosecutor's office is of the opinion that the plaintiff had no right to react in this way, especially since a custody judge in the last few days has rejected her request to initiate a legal protection proceedings against her mother.
Liliane Bettencourt "is fully competent, not under protection and has no guardian.
No one has the right to act in their place", said Marie-Christine Daubigney, the representative of the prosecutor's office.
The Court has now decided to give judgment, after the admissibility trial of Mme Bettencourt-Meyers has been held.
The end of strategic early warning?
If nothing changes in the leadership of the big French companies , our struggle for the development of economic intelligence has been in vain ...
For over a decade, the attitude of management of large companies in relation to its employees, said the position of the company vis-à-vis the consumer before the marketing revolution: it is for the staff to join "values" intended to impose the best as it used to be on the consumer products designed by the technicians in the plant.
By putting the customer at the centre of the companies, the marketing revolution has given the strategies of conquering the markets in place ... although the authoritarian temptation to impose products separated factors preferences of the customers again regularly!
The demobilization of the staff can lead to deadly demoralization.
The suicides at France Telecom, PSA or Renault are only the tip of a much larger phenomenon which affects employees in particular.
This demobilization has a negative impact on the development of all the intellectual functions of the enterprise, especially those of R & D and, more importantly, those of economic intelligence.
In fact, the IE (Intelligence Economique = economic intelligence) "requires from all parties involved (...) a proactive approach and a forward-looking attitude"; it demands from employees a commitment that is completely contrary to the instructions of authoritarian management.
We therefore call for an industrial revolution that would place employees at the centre of the company's concerns on an equal footing with the customer.
The very limited usefulness of internal opinion polls
Will internal opinion polls, such as the questionnaire Orange has presented to its employees, fuel this revolution in management practice?
I'm afraid not
- First, because I could see that the whole structure, faced with a new situation, after many detours, finally comes to do, first of all, what it always did.
It is also because authoritarianism - one of the pathologies of power - grows in proportion to the importance of its own failures.
And finally, because most executives have a very simplified idea of human behavior.
Their interpretation of psychology is mechanistic.
They are adopting, with intellectual comfort, the old behavioural theory which has recently been revived by the American 'neuroscience' and unwittingly spread widely by research institutes and the media.
Thus, by suggesting that it is possible to use the 'lever' (sic) to engage employees, a recent survey by Ipsos published in Le Figaro.fr reinforces the attitude of managers towards a mechanistic control system unsuited to the world of today.
Identifying and measuring the factors of mobilisation
The first is that the 'social' dimension of the concept of 'social responsibility' is not a new one, but that it is a new one, and that it is not a new one.
It consists in integrating into every management consideration or practice a basic protocol: for the wage-earners, commitment to the enterprise is possible only if it clearly appears as a means of realizing part of their dreams, ambitions and projects.
At present, only the studies of multifunctional analysis take up this concept of employee motivation.
These studies have shown that they judge their company on the basis of a pre-defined doxa, which allows them to estimate, through their perceived image of the company, what it offers them in order to achieve their life goals.
By identifying and measuring these factors of mobilisation, business managers can control, predict and anticipate their 'social performance' and put their human resource management back in the right place.
In this way they create a fertile ground conducive to the coordinated development of a robust and efficient economic intelligence.
The Oslo speech: the "just war" brings Obama praise from the right
The American right wing welcomed Barack Obama's speech in Oslo on Friday and was pleased that the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize defended the notion of "just war" against the enemies of the United States.
The conservatives who had mocked Obama's award on October 9th applauded the president's speech, following the example of former 2008 vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin.
I liked what he said, Palin declared the face of the right wing of the Republican Party in the USA Today newspaper, adding that she herself had raised the issue of a "sometimes necessary" war in her recently published memoirs.
War is, of course, the last thing I think the Americans want to do, but it is necessary.
We have to stop the terrorists down there, she says.
Obama, who inherited two wars from his predecessor George W. Bush, the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, sought to justify the use of force in Oslo on Thursday, a way of explaining his decision nine days ago to send 30,000 additional troops to Afghanistan.
Another opponent of Obama, Newt Gingrich, said that the president had done "a very good job" in Oslo.
I thought the speech was really very good, said the former speaker of the House of Representatives, who particularly acknowledged the reference to "the existence of evil in the world" in Obama's words.
In some parts, he felt that this speech was quite historic, said Ginrich, who was interviewed on the radio programme 'The Takeaway'.
The former lawmaker, who is seen by some as a possible candidate for the Republican nomination for the 2012 presidential election, said he was pleased to see a "president of the left" who reminded the members of the Nobel Committee that they were "not free and could not give a prize for peace if the use of force did not exist".
For Michael Gerson, former secretary to George W. Bush and now editor of the Washington Post, Obama delivered "a very American speech".
In addition to presenting himself as a "cosmopolitan" who "always does it", he "speaks like an American president" when he points out that Europeans "live in a security bubble that they did not create and do not do much to protect", says Gerson.
Among the few unconvinced right-wingers, former UN ambassador John Bolton, a hawk of the Bush era, called the speech "boring, high-pitched and uninspiring" on the website of National Review Online.
To the left of the president, Democratic Representative Dennis Kucinich is concerned about how Barack Obama is defending the withdrawal of the military.
If war is wrapped up in the cloak of justice, he warns, the slaughter of innocent people can easily be justified.
The moderate left press, however, continues to praise the president.
The Los Angeles Times, which still believes that the Nobel Prize was prematurely awarded to Obama, described the speech itself as "a monumental work" for a speaker like him, who is known for his talent.
The speech in Oslo "offers a roadmap for steering international decisions against conflict, poverty and oppression", the California daily enthuses.
The New York Times believes that Obama "delivered the necessary speech" and describes his speech as "dark and exemplary at the same time".
Truck driver: Three marathons for a deal to secure supply for Christmas
After a three-week marathon of negotiations, the trade unions of the road association and the TLF - the only employer organization that remained until the end - reached an agreement on Friday night that ends the strike order and the threat of a severe supply shortage at Christmas.
At the signing session on Friday evening, the Secretary of State for Transport, Dominique Bussereau, welcomed the agreement, which was reached on Wednesday morning after several weeks of negotiations.
After a second night of negotiations, the negotiators parted early Friday morning in the hope of signing the agreement in the late morning.
This was despite the fact that the three employers' associations (FNTR, Unostra and OTRE) had left the meeting in disarray.
However, more than six hours passed from the start of the meeting at 11:00 a.m. to the conclusion of the agreement, and it was not until 6:00 p.m. that the agreement was signed.
The conflict "would have caused a lot of damage to the companies" and "there was a fear that it would affect the holidays at the end of the year", says Bussereau.
The agreement provides for a wage increase of 4% for the lowest wage groups (local and regional road transport) and 2.9% for the highest wage groups (international transport).
The hourly rate for the lowest paid employees thus rises from EUR 8.72 to EUR 9.06.
"It's not much, but we're starting small", says Patrice Clos (FO).
Activists are now being instructed to stop blocking the supply centers.
"However, there will probably always be some dissenters who are not satisfied with the agreement", he adds.
The TLF chairman, Philippe Grillot, spoke of a "good agreement" although it was "difficult to allow these wage increases in the face of international competition".
According to him, the increase is 170 euros per month for the low wage groups and 100 to 120 euros for the high wage groups.
'This agreement is based on common sense and respect for workers' said Maxime Dumont (CFDT), while Thierry Douine (CFTC) described it as 'a historic agreement'.
The Commission's proposal for a directive on the protection of workers from risks related to exposure to chemical substances is a very important one.
The agreement also provides for a 3% increase in travel costs and the maintenance of the total budget for road transport in the first half of 2010, which will allow in particular to address the issue of the 13th monthly salary and the modernisation of collective agreements.
Mr Bussereau recalled that 'the reduction of the employer's contributions by EUR 100 million' was the subject of a government amendment to the 2009 amended budget bill, which was adopted by the National Assembly on the night of Thursday to Friday.
The government is calling for "an identical" vote in the Senate.
The signature of the TLF allows the agreement to apply initially to the companies affiliated to this organization and subsequently to the entire profession in the event of extension by the Minister of Labour.
This will be the case "in a very short time", Bussereau assures.
The opposition of the employers' organizations can only delay the procedure.
The FNTR association denounced a "fraudulent trade" because the 100 million euros "had already been promised to the sector to offset part of the carbon tax".
The Secretary of State for Transport urged us to negotiate as soon as possible, but not on the basis of a joint analysis, but in order not to crush the goose eaters in the coming Christmas days, Unostra laments.
The Association of Otreas believes that the agreement is likely to "dig a big hole for the small and medium-sized enterprises in the sector in the coming 12 months".
RER A: Disruptions this weekend, unions dissatisfied with RATP proposals
The disruption of the RER A, the largest high-speed railway in France for the greater Paris area and the Île-de-France, continued over the weekend, while a meeting on Friday, the second day of the strike, between the unions and the management of the RATP (Independent Parisian Passenger Transport Authority), which keeps the strikers waiting with their demands for wage increases.
On this important shopping weekend before Christmas, no trains ran between 10:00 and 20:00 on the central line (between La Défense and Nation) only one train in two was ready for service, and outside the central line only one train in four was ready for service.
The connection to the SNCF trains was interrupted in Nanterre, forcing passengers to change trains.
The Galeries Lafayette department store chain, which has 200,000 customers a day, welcomed the fact that "the RATP is making efforts to link the big shops by road".
The RER A line runs through the Paris metropolitan area from west to east.
The section of the RATP connects the towns of Saint-Germain-en-Laye and Nanterre, and Boissy-Saint-Léger and Marne-La-Vallée.
On Friday, about one train in two ran on schedule during peak hours, and almost none during off-peak hours.
As on Thursday, there was no crowd on the platforms, as the inhabitants of the Île-de-France had adjusted to the situation.
This early morning, the train station of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (Yvelines) was much less crowded than usual, mainly because of the lack of secondary school students.
In Boissy-Saint-Léger (Val-de-Marne), Jack Nbakina, an engineer (29), said he had got up an extra 'hour and a half earlier to get to work on time'.
SNCF, which had planned to have its staff and security guards attend to passengers, pointed out that there had been no congestion at the Saint-Lazare station.
The trains operated by the SNCF on the RER A line from or to Cergy-Le-Haut arrived at or departed from the station of Saint-Lazare to connect with the metros.
On Saturday and Sunday, the main meetings of the strikers were held again, during which the results were reviewed, which the unions had classified as "dirty" after the meeting with the leadership on Friday afternoon.
The RER managing director proposed the specific elaboration of a protocol for RER line A concerning all relevant aspects, working hours, professional careers, etc.
The Commission is also proposing to extend the scope of the directive to include the transport of dangerous goods.
The CGT was indignant that the RATP itself had put its proposals for wage increases in brackets, stressing that the top management was 'incapable of solving a problem, whereas it was possible for the long-distance drivers and the SNCF'.
RATP clarified that a new meeting to "examine in detail the working conditions" was planned for Monday.
This also shows the associations that the company 'ignores the weekend drivers'.
In the morning, about 150 drivers visited the headquarters of a committee in Paris.
Once again, it was the leadership, who had so far refused any discussion during the strike, and suggested a meeting after the situation had calmed down.
On Tuesday, the conflict threatened to spread to the RER B line, following a previous announcement by Unsa and Indépendants.
The unions are calling for a wage increase of between 120 (Unsa) and 150 euros, of which 30 euros are variable (CGT, FO, CFDT, Sud, Indépendants), and they are also concerned about the deterioration of working conditions on this route, which is used by millions of commuters every day.
RER line drivers, who have years of experience, receive a gross wage of between EUR 2 200 and 2 700 plus a wage supplement of EUR 600 to 650 for shift work and for Sundays and public holidays.
Turkey's Constitutional Court dissolves pro-Kurdish party: decision with serious consequences
Turkey's Constitutional Court announced the dissolution of the country's main pro-Kurdish party on Friday, a decision that was immediately followed by angry demonstrations in the Kurdish community in the country's southeast and in Istanbul.
This decision threatens to make the work of the government, which is trying to reach out to the Kurdish community to put an end to the conflicts that have lasted for 25 years, enormously difficult.
The "Party for a Democratic Society" (DTP) was dissolved because it had become a "site for activities that are detrimental to the independence of the state and its indivisible unity", the president of the Constitutional Court Hasim Kiliç told the press four days after the decision.
According to Kiliç, the decision was taken unanimously by 11 judges, with a majority of seven votes needed to impose the dissolution.He also pointed out that 37 of the party's leaders, including chairman Ahmet Türk and MP Aysel Tugluk, were excluded from political life for five years.
The judge also announced the lifting of the parliamentary immunity enjoyed by Türk and Tugluk, as well as the confiscation of the party's assets.
The DTP now has 21 seats in parliament (out of 550).
The party leaders said before the verdict that the parliamentarians would rather leave the parliament than serve as non-party parliamentarians.
The decision followed a 2007 case brought by the Prosecutor of the Turkish Federal Court, Abdurrahman Yalçinkaya, who accused the DTP of following the "directions" of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), which is considered a terrorist organization by Ankara and many other countries.
Many observers believe that the DTP is the legal political showcase of the PKK rebels.
The party claims to have "no connection" with the PKK, but refuses to call it a terrorist organisation and calls on the government to negotiate.
The ruling by the Constitutional Court is a compromise between the government's efforts to reach out to the Kurdish community and to propose a series of measures to strengthen the rights of the Kurds, to curb Kurdish support for the PKK and to put an end to the conflicts.
The leaders of the DTP reaffirm that a dissolution could lead to a resurgence of tensions in southeastern Anatolia, where numerous demonstrations against the conditions of detention of PKK leader Abdullah Öcalan in recent weeks have led to clashes with the police.
Since the announcement of the court, thousands of protesters have gathered outside the DTP headquarters in the southeastern city of Diyarbakir, which is populated mostly by Kurds.
The police used tear gas canisters and water cannons as the protesters began throwing Molotov cocktails and rocks.
Hundreds of people also demonstrated in Istanbul.
After the verdict, Türk said he expected the court's decision to "deepen the despair even further".
The EU is also calling for the establishment of a European Union-wide network of information centres on the Kurdish issue.
The government, made up of a party that emerged from the Islamist movement, also regretted the decision.
"We are opposed to the closure of the parties on principle.
This will not solve the problems", said Energy Minister Taner Yildiz.
"This decision is a torpedoing of the democratic opening that has been promoted by the government", said political market observer Ahmet Insel.
"It is clear that we can expect a reaction from the PKK", he added.
On Thursday, the PKK claimed responsibility for an attack that killed seven soldiers in northern Turkey three days earlier, one of the most brutal attacks in recent months.
The snowfall may come
A really crisp winter, that's what Wolfgang Brauburger wants.
The FES winter service director said that he did not want to harass the citizens.
It is so that his employees can try out and master all the vehicle technology.
This weekend, according to weather forecasters, it could be as high as it's ever been.
More than 330 employees and 120 vehicles are on hand to handle snow and ice.
The FES follows a precise plan.
As soon as it snows throughout Frankfurt and the temperatures drop below zero degrees, 20 so-called A-tracks are used by large-scale vehicles, explains Brauburger.
These include main roads and thoroughfares such as the Neue Weg and the Hanau Landstraße.
It also includes fire-fighting routes, public transport routes, pedestrian zones and sloping routes such as the Atzelbergstraße.
The FES service starts at 3 a.m.
The roughly 4,000 miles [1,040 km] would have to be sprayed with wet salt, which is more adherent, in a maximum of three hours if necessary.
That's why the FES starts at 3:00 a.m. "to keep the tracks clear until commercial traffic starts".
It's gonna be hard to get snow before 7:30.
Then we have a problem, says the winter manager, "because then no one is willing to make room for the scatterers".
Only after that, if it does not snow any more, are supply and development roads, including the Rat-Beil-Street, next.
The last priority is the back roads and side roads.
There will be complaints, Brauburger knows.
At five o'clock in the morning, the FES foot-soldiers set off, clearing the danger points and crossings as a matter of priority.
The FES could not usually take care of all the cycle paths.
There is a special service in Frankfurt that keeps an eye on the bridges from 10 p.m. to 4:30 a.m., says Brauburger.
Since the surface is smooth, the disperser is ready to go as soon as the temperature drops below two degrees.
If necessary, the police will also be called.
The Cradle of the Dinosaurs
Tawa hallae looked like many other carnivorous dinosaurs: six feet long and five feet wide, it walked on two strong hind legs, had an elongated skull with sharp, curved teeth, short arms with sickle claws, and a long tail.
If the species had lived a few million years later, it would have been nothing special.
But Tawa hallae was one of the first dinosaurs to have these body features, reported Sterling Nesbitt of the University of Texas at Austin and colleagues in Thursday's issue of the journal Science.
The animal lived about 215 million years ago in what is now New Mexico, which was then in a dry zone of the supercontinent Pangaea on the equator.
Tawa opens a new window into the early evolution of dinosaurs, says Nesbitt.
It tells us a lot about the relationship, the distribution and the characteristics of the early dinosaurs.
In 2006, Nesbitt and other paleontologists began excavating at the Ghost Ranch in northern New Mexico.
"We sometimes found a dozen dinosaur bones in one day, which is unprecedented for Triassic fossils", says team member Randall Irmis of the Utah Museum of Natural History.
Some of the bones were quickly identified by the researchers as new species.
During the excavation, they collected the remains of five individuals.
Finding confirms theories about early dinosaur history
The name "Tawa" comes from the Hopi sun god.
For Sterling Nesbitt, it is an extraordinary find: "Triassic dinosaur fossils are extremely rare, mostly found in single fragments".
Other dinosaur experts do not necessarily share this enthusiasm.
The find is not particularly spectacular, but it does confirm some theories about the early history of dinosaurs, says Martin Sander of the University of Bonn.
According to the current view, dinosaurs first appeared about 230 million years ago.
But many of the oldest fossils are incomplete, so the classification of these Ur-dinosaurs is mostly controversial.
For example, experts debate when lizards split into their three main lines of evolution: the carnivorous theropods, which later included the Tyrannosaurus rex, the velociraptor, and also the birds, the four-legged sauropods known as "long-tailed" and their relatives, and the plant-eating ornithischians, which included the triceratops and stegosauruses.
According to the analysis of Nesbitt and his colleagues, Tawa hallae is an original theropod.
It has an interesting combination of primitive and advanced features, says Nesbitt.
For example, the skull of Tawa hallae, the researchers found evidence of air sacs, as the descendants of the theropods, the birds, have.
Thanks to the air sacs, birds breathe more efficiently than mammals.
In the case of the Tawa hallae, the bones of the spine were also apparently partially filled with air.
Tawa is the oldest and most primitive theropod with air sacs, says Randall Irmis.
Since the related line of giant sauropods later also had air sacs and light-weight bones, it is likely that the common ancestor of both groups had already produced this useful innovation.
At least three waves of migration to North America
Because the earliest known dinosaurs lived in South America, researchers conclude that the lizards first appeared there.
According to this theory, the three lines of development separated early and spread from South America to all continents, which then formed a single landmass as the supercontinent Pangaea.
This is explained by the fact that the team, along with Tawa hallae, found the remains of two other, not particularly closely related theropods.
The three cannot be descended from a common immigrant ancestor, argue the researchers.
"We believe there were at least three waves of migration to North America", says Alan Turner of the American Museum of Natural History in New York, a co-author of the science study.
Of course, there are contradictions.
An even older species, Silesaurus, a sister group of dinosaurs, lived in what is now Poland, says paleontologist Martin Sander of Bonn.
He feels that the picture may be distorted because South America has a very large number of primitive dinosaur fossils, while other continents have very little.
How the dinosaurs managed to evolve from a relatively rare side-line of the reptilian lineage to the dominant land vertebrates of the Middle Ages is still a mystery.
During the Triassic period, dinosaurs shared their habitat with many other reptiles, including the ancestors of today's crocodiles and the flying dinosaurs, and with numerous other lizards.
Towards the end of the Triassic, dinosaurs spread around the world and developed many new species, while the Triassic-Jurassic boundary became extinct.
Success stories did not last forever
There are two hypotheses to explain this change, says Martin Sander.
There could have been a mass extinction, where the dinosaurs just happened to survive, but the other reptiles didn't.
Or the dinosaurs were better adapted, so they could beat the competition out of the field.
The success story did not last forever.
150 million years later, a meteorite impact helped to give birth to a group of animals that had also evolved in the Triassic and since then had given birth to a shadow life: the mammals.
Solidarity from Vienna to Sao Paulo
The list is long and the signatories are international.
Professors from the University of Toronto, the University of Cambridge, the University of Vienna or Berkeley in California are on it.
We have teachers from Naples, from Quebec, from Edinburgh, from New York, from Sao Paulo, from Berlin, from Bremen.
The police's eviction of the occupied casino at Goethe University in Frankfurt is making waves around the world.
278 professors and lecturers from Goethe University, but also from universities throughout Germany, Europe and North and South America, stand in solidarity with the protesting students on the Westend campus.
In a statement written in German and English, they "disapprove" of the police action instigated by the Bureau.
University president Werner Müller-Estler had the building occupied by students and teachers in the educational strike evacuated last week because walls and artworks had been smeared.
Five students were injured.
The damage to property, the signatories said, did not justify "the violent dismantling by a police commando of self-organized courses for students and teachers".
The eviction constitutes an "unacceptable interference" in the freedom of research and teaching.
The exclusive focus on vandalism serves "the delegitimization and criminalization of the protest" and distracts from the content.
The Bureau has not made the necessary speech.
The lecturers are demanding the immediate cessation of criminal prosecution.
The majority of the occupiers did not support the damage to property, they say.
Protest is legitimated
The youth of the Verdi trade union and the German Trade Union Confederation also stand in solidarity with the students.
The protest is a legitimate expression of growing concern for their future, says Alexander Klein, the youth secretary of the Verdi region.
The European Parliament has already adopted a resolution on the situation in the Middle East.
We are grateful to the university president.
Destruction and occupation are totally unacceptable means, she said in a current hour on Thursday in the Wiesbaden state parliament.
We understand the protest, but we do not understand vandalism, says Peter Beuth, a member of the CDU parliament.
The opposition parties SPD, Greens and Left saw it differently.
The CDU is using painted walls as a pretext to criminalise the protest, said Janine Wissler (L).
Instead of dealing with the students' arguments and demands, the building was evacuated.
The Left Party has submitted a motion asking the Minister of the Interior to report on the police operation.
New Silicon Valley
For many years it was considered a secret city, inaccessible to Western visitors.
Selenograd, one of ten districts of the capital city of Moscow, was a heavily guarded location for secret armament research in the Soviet Union.
Today, the municipality with its 216,000 inhabitants, 37 kilometres from the centre of Moscow, is considered "Russian Silicon Valley".
Important research and production facilities for micro and nanoelectronics are located here.
As early as September 2008, Selenograd's representatives had been in contact with the Frankfurt Science Centre Riedberg - with the EU institutions and the companies of the Frankfurt Innovation Centre (FIZ).
There were several visits to each other and on Wednesday Selenograd and Riedberg signed a 'protocol of closer cooperation' in Frankfurt.
The Russian delegation was led by Moscow's Deputy Mayor Yuri Rosljak and Selenograd's Prefect Anatoly Smirnov, while the planning director for Frankfurt was Edwin Schwarz.
In 2010, representatives of the FIZ and small and medium-sized enterprises of the science fusion focus will travel to Selenograd for a seminar.
Scientific exchanges
It is a continuous scientific exchange.
But it's also about economic relations.
The FIZ will be able to gain a foothold in the growing Russian market.
Conversely, Russian scientific firms want to get contracts in Germany.
Selenograd is the seat of important Russian research institutes and companies.
The Moscow Institute of Electronic Engineering, the large companies Citronics and Rosssijskaja Elektronika are among them.
The commune was founded in 1958 as a so-called "socialist planstadt" for armaments research.
Selenograd (literally translated as "Green City") got its name from the wooded hillside where the research facilities are located.
The Commission has already submitted a proposal for a directive on the use of the term 'brake blocks'.
The dimension of Stuttgart 21 is not high enough.
For its proponents, the project is simply about 'the new heart of Europe'.
S21 is much more than the laying of a railway station, more than a monstrous construction project that will plunge the city of the Baden-Württemberg state capital into a decade of hopeless construction site chaos.
Stuttgart 21 is born of the spirit of the 1980s.
At the time, mainline railway stations with tracks ending in the middle of the city were considered 19th-century transportation fossils that acted as brake blocks on modern rail traffic, as it once took a tremendous amount of time to turn locomotives from the rear to the front.
Drive in, stop for a while, keep going - that's the way it is.
And that's why the mainline stations should disappear: in Frankfurt and Munich.
And in Stuttgart, a passing station situated about halfway along the trans-European railway between Paris and Budapest/Bratislava - hence the slogan "The heart of Europe".
S21 is now being tackled, even though the visions of the 1980s are no longer compatible with reality.
Even very ambitious planners have realised that in the large cities of Hesse and Bavaria it is almost unaffordable to implement the deep-water laying.
However, since modern trains with locomotives and coaches at both ends, the mainline tracks no longer have the problem of entering and leaving.
However, Stuttgart 21 is now being opened alongside the new ICE line to Ulm.
State and local politicians have pushed it through.
The railway is taking part in this because the risks of the largest single infrastructure project in the Republic are borne by the taxpayers and not by the state corporation.
The project is still justified to some extent in terms of urban planning.
A new urban space is being created, which - according to the computer-generated graphics of the planners - will be equipped with a lot of greenery.
S21 is harmful to the rail transport system.
The railway station and the extension of the line are intended for passenger traffic, which - typical of the 1980s - was attributed to huge growth.
There was no competition from low-cost airlines.
The Commission has also proposed that the Commission should be given the task of drawing up a report on the implementation of the directive on the protection of the environment.
However, the new section is not suitable for freight trains because of the steep gradients.
Even more important, S21 also affects many other rail projects indirectly.
The Schwabisch is to be invested in a good six billion euros.
That's the official number.
Experts say that $10 billion to $15 billion is realistic.
The Commission has already set out its position on the question of the future of the Internet.
Sixty major projects are on the list of the Ministry of Transport.
One of the most important is the extension of the 180-kilometre-long section through the Rhine valley.
Since 1987, the track has been built at a rapid pace.
It is urgent that we should press the correct button here.
But S21 will act as a brake pad.
The Rhine Valley railway becomes a bottleneck for international freight transport: right in the heart of Europe.
Government reviews airport ruling
The government has left open in the Wiesbaden state parliament whether it will appeal against the Hessian Administrative Court's (VGH) decision on the night flight ban.
The CDU/FDP coalition has commissioned experts to examine the more than 400-page ECJ ruling, said Economy Minister Dieter Posch (FDP).
The Hoge Raad in Kassel had on that day given written reasons for the fact that the country would have to re-regulate the night flight ban in the event of the construction of the planned Northwest runway at Frankfurt Airport.
The authorization of 17 flights between 11 p.m. and 5 a.m., as envisaged by the regional government, is incompatible with the legal protection of the population against nighttime aircraft noise.
The coalition has until January 4 to decide whether to appeal the ruling.
The opposition criticised this delay and urged the government representatives to forgo a review at the Federal Administrative Court in Leipzig.
The German Social Democrats (SPD) leader Torsten Schäfer-Gümbel called on the CDU and FDP to return to their pre-election promises of a night flight ban, otherwise this would be seen as a "breach of the promise".
It's a hell of a lot harder to keep your word, said Green leader Tarek Al-Wazir, referring to the FDP's election slogan "We keep our word".
Minister Posch rejected the accusation of Schäfer-Gümbel, the state government is trying to get to their night flights with "perversion of justice and trickery".
A thorough legal examination will take its time.
The coalition doesn't want to operate on a "quick first impression" basis.
The Commission is also proposing a new directive on the protection of the environment against the dangers of noise.
The Commission is also proposing that the Commission should be able to take account of the views of the European Parliament on the subject.
US banks pay back aid
The crisis-ridden big US banks are letting go of their state-owned shackles.
Bank of America on Wednesday paid back a total of $45 billion in aid from the Tarp Bank Rescue Fund.
And Citigroup is also planning to pay back the state aid, according to a report by the US broadcaster CNBC.
The institutions want to get rid of the restrictions that have accompanied the acceptance of the money  such as the limitation on the payment of manager bonuses and the payment of high fees.
Bank of America had raised a good $19 billion in fresh money from investors through convertible bonds.
The rest of the sum she took from her own treasury, which was well filled, among other things, by sales of department stores.
Bank chief Kenneth Lewis thanked the American taxpayer on Wednesday night: "The money injection has helped us through a very difficult time".
The firm had risen to the pinnacle of the financial crisis with its takeover of the investment bank Merrill Lynch.
Citigroup also intends to raise funds on the capital market to offset its liabilities to the State.
As early as Thursday, the U.S. bank could announce a roughly $20 billion capital increase, CNBC reported, citing sources.
A spokesman for Citigroup declined to comment.
In June, Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan Chase and Morgan Stanley had already repaid their loans.
Quick and easy choice
It all happened sooner than I thought.
Barely two weeks after the ZDF board of directors forced the incumbent editor-in-chief Nikolaus Brender from office, the station can present a successor.
Last night, the board was supposed to vote on personnel.
The favourite was Peter Frey, head of the ZDF-Hauptstadt studios in Berlin.
However, the broadcaster did not confirm this - officially, so as not to prejudge the proceedings.
However, it is likely that the fact that ZDF's director, Markus Schächter, was not harmed further should have played a role in the decision not to pass this proposal to the board of directors.
Frey, Schächter's candidate, needs the support of nine of the 14 members of the board.
The outcome of the vote was not known at the time of the closing of this issue.
Two weeks ago, Schächter's proposal to extend the contract with Nikolaus Brender for another five years failed in the board of directors.
Only seven members voted for Brender, seven voted against him, and Brender's defeat was a bitter defeat for Schächter, but one that was to be expected.
The majority of the union's board of directors had already signaled weeks before the election that they did not want to confirm Brender in office.
The organisation had organised the resistance against the editor-in-chief of the Hessian Prime Minister Roland Koch.
Arguing that under Brender, ZDF news programmes had lost ratings, he refused to allow the highly respected editor-in-chief to continue in office.
This led to protests until just before the elections, in which political influence on the ZDF was branded.
The last time 35 jurists intervened in the debate, they considered Koch's action unconstitutional.
It's not gonna help.
For the person
Peter Frey was born on 4 August 1957 in Bingen.
He studied politics, pedagogy and novel writing.
After that, he worked at the Südwestfunk and the Frankfurt Rundschau.
In 1983 Frey moved to ZDF, first to "heute-journal".
Subsequent posts: personal adviser to the editor-in-chief from 1988 to 1990; correspondent in Washington in 1991/92; head of the Morning magazine until 1998; head of ZDF's foreign policy until 2001; head of the ZDF's capital studio since then.
The Greens announced a constitutional lawsuit after the election of Brender, who was elected journalist of the year by the industry magazine Medium Magazine on Wednesday.
Koch's opponent in the board of directors, the Rhineland-Palatinate Prime Minister Kurt Beck, declared last week that the Länder should change the ZDF staff contract so that the intendant's staff proposals cannot be blocked by a politically motivated majority.
However, Beck also excluded a selection of party politicians from the supervisory bodies of the ZDF.
Brender's likely successor, Peter Frey, had recommended himself to the board of directors with a clever move - by sharply criticizing the board immediately after the Brender election.
Thanks to this evidence of journalistic independence, Schächter was able to nominate him for the post of editor-in-chief without losing face, and the board of directors elected him without being suspected of having appointed a party crusader.
In the party arithmetic, Frey is always considered a left-liberal.
The study is being dismantled
Partial success for students: After a year of educational strike, the Ministers of Culture of the Länder finally stepped in on Thursday: at a meeting of the Conference of Ministers of Culture and Rectors of Universities, both sides agreed to improve the conditions of study at Bachelor's and Master's level.
The students should be able to manage their studies in the future.
In particular, they agreed to reduce the examination burden: each study module should be completed with only one examination.
The workload of students is also to be reviewed and "a realistic and acceptable level" ensured.
The policy and the universities also want to simplify the recognition of examination results between universities inside and outside Germany.
The countries committed themselves to making common structural guidelines for bachelor and master programmes more flexible.
There should be no national regulations that differ from this.
Less testing
Since the student protests began in June, ministers of culture and university rectors have been spreading the word about the better student mobility.
Now, for the first time, it was filled with concrete content.
The so-called Accreditation Council decided to drastically reduce the number of examinations in some cases: "Each module usually ends with only one examination", says a 30-page paper that is intended to partially re-regulate the admission of degree courses.
The "significant reduction in the examination burden", said Reinhold Grimm, chairman of the Accreditation Council, was intended to "prevent a trend of errors which significantly impaired the readability of the study".
In addition, 'studibility' is to be 'the decisive criterion' in future design.
The Commission's proposal for a directive on the protection of the environment and the environment at work is based on the principle of the protection of the environment and the protection of the environment.
The Commission has already taken a number of measures to
The students "deserve to be given a space for action which enables and encourages their own initiative".
The rules apply to the admission of new students and to the review of existing courses.
These must be "reaccredited" every five years, which means, however, that it will take until 2015 for all courses to be reviewed.
The responsibility for this is shared by ten accreditation agencies throughout Germany, which are under the authority of the Accreditation Council set up by the Länder.
In October, the Ministers of Culture had "strongly" called on the countries to influence the agencies so that the amount of material was not too large and the examination regime was not too strict.
In some Länder, universities and universities of applied sciences have already agreed with the Länder ministries on measures to this end.
The only country to date to have committed additional funds to the further development of the Bologna process was Rhineland-Palatinate.
The money will be used to set up tutoring programmes and to strengthen student advising, examination and foreign exchange offices.
The country and universities want to spend 10 million euros on this.
At the beginning of 2010, the government intends to introduce an amendment to the Higher Education Act in Parliament.
After this, only one examination is required to complete a study model.
The aim is to make the curriculum more flexible, to ensure recognition of qualifications from other universities and to facilitate access to the Master's degree.
By the end of next year, all the country's study programs will be reviewed for their suitability for study.
The government and the opposition had argued again on Thursday over the conditions of study in the country.
But the decisions were also criticized.
The Federal Chairman of the Juso University Group called for the formulation of education policy to no longer take place "behind closed doors" of the ministers and university rectors.
After the educational strikes at the latest, the students were now also affected and should "speak a word".
The future academics were supported by the president of the Conference of Rectors of Higher Education (HRK), Margret Wintermantel: "We need the experience of students", she said on Thursday at a meeting with the ministers of culture, with whom the HRK is discussing a joint reform paper.
The Education and Science Trade Union (GEW) did not go far enough with the Bonn Decisions: it demanded a legal right to allow any graduate with a bachelor's degree to enter a further master's degree.
Secondly, countries must ensure that there are enough places for today's generation of bachelor's students in the master's programmes with the best possible study conditions, says Andreas Keller, GEW board member.
The countries must recruit a significantly higher number of lecturers.
The Ministers of Culture did not comment on the question of more open access to the Master.
More than a footnote to Herta Müller
"We are entering Germany and there is almost no control"... is the opening line of a poem by the lyricist Werner Söllner, in which he discusses the arrival experience of a dissident who has won freedom but has also lost his language space.
Born in 1951 in the Romanian Banat, Werner Söllner worked first as a German and English teacher in Bucharest and later as an editor in a children's book publishing company before moving to Frankfurt am Main in 1982.
Söllner has been awarded various literary prizes, in 1993 he gave the legendary Frankfurt Poetry Lectures at Goethe University, and since 2002 he has been head of the Hessian Literature Forum in the Mousonturm in Frankfurt.
The European Parliament has been asked to take a decision on the future of the European Union, and the Commission has been asked to take a decision on the future of the European Union.
Visibly uncertain and embarrassed, Söllner read a statement in which he confessed to his collaboration as an IM for the Romanian secret service Securitate in front of fellow Romanian-German writers, including Richard Wagner, William Totok, Franz Hodjak, and Helmuth Frauendorfer.
Together with some of those present, Söllner had received the German Language Prize in 1989.
The recruitment attempts would have begun in a stealth manner, first in 1971.
The Commission is also proposing to extend the scope of the directive to cover all types of waste.
The lyricist Werner Söllner is the Walter.
Almost simultaneously with the Nobel Prize ceremony for Herta Müller and her unprecedented literary confrontation with the mechanisms of dictatorial rule, the literary scene and especially the community of German authors of Romanian origin is being shocked by a case that reveals the abyss and the inferiority of a political system based on surveillance and espionage.
Werner Söllner is, as far as we know, not only a perpetrator but also a victim.
After Söllner's confession, literary scholar Michael Markel said that IM Walter had played a role in his Securitate file, and pointed out that IM Walter had had a positive influence on him.
He had "beaten him out" in all the points that were difficult for him at the time, according to Markel.
He said he felt it was morally necessary to make that remark.
Söllner's statement was unexpected in its form and before this audience, but the confession of a former dissident and his collaboration with the Romanian intelligence service is not completely surprising.
Germany was a comfortable reserve for the Securitate's spies, Herta Müller had already written in July in the Zeit, after she had read her own file, 914 pages long.
The people involved, it may be assumed, are speculative and in some cases may have known which clever name was behind the cover names Sorin, Voicu and even Walter.
Unlike the now very procedural inspection of the Stasi files in this country, the handling of the legacies of the Securitate surveillance is still very diffuse.
Systematic information has been pushed back and hindered in recent years.
The National Council for Securities Processing (CNSAS), a branch of the Birthler Authority, was only established in 1999, but the process of issuing securities has been rather sluggish since then.
Only since 2005 has there been a law governing the management of the files.
The influence of former Securitate members in Romania is still very high, as was shown by an interview after the announcement of the Nobel Prize for Herta Müller, in which a former Securitate chief from Temesvar made disparaging comments about the winner.
She's a psychotic, after all, she was only interrogated once.
The infamy of power was to be expressed here in the most unabashed form of freedom of speech.
The Söllner case, as so often in the context of concealed guilt, certainly raises inevitable questions.
The calm reaction of the audience to Söllner's confession gives hope that the continuation of this chapter will be determined by the need to know rather than by blame and shame.
The introduction of the work of Herta Müller, who received the Nobel Prize yesterday, is more than a footnote.
The Champions League
It looked like a well-dressed salesman returning from a very nice Christmas party where a sporting goods manufacturer had distributed goodies, when the new VfB coach Christian Gross, accompanied by an orange plastic bag of equipment, got into a C-Class that was just called a quarter of an hour after midnight. ̈
The man with the distinctive bald head was chauffeured to a city he didn't know.
Otherwise, he could have driven himself - there was no alcohol involved, and the 55-year-old was not drunk with happiness either.
It's been a nice evening, but we'll be back to work in the morning.
Or the real thing.
In the words of the Swissman who had just three days earlier said: 'We have reached the quarter-finals' - in the Champions League, thanks to the 3-1 win against Unirea Urziceni from Romania - 'but we must not be blinded by our success: it will be a brutal, hard fight against relegation'.
The "much more important task" is due on Sunday.
Then it's time to repeat the league's routine in Mainz.
And the weaknesses were revealed again after the quick three goals by Marica (5th), Träsch (8th) and Pogrebnyak (11th).
Drawing
The Champions League round of 16 (played on 16/17. + 23/24 February/play-offs 9/10 + 16/17 March) will be played on 18 December in Nyon.
So the joy over the fulminating insight of the successor of Babbel was held in check.
Not only the supposed savior, who had given the unsure Stuttgart pros confidence, commitment and joy of play in a short time.
I approached the players and told them to remember their strengths and to be more courageous, explained the psychic plumber Gross the so simple-sounding recipe for success, which had not worked under Therapeut Babbel.
He has unleashed a certain magic, admitted Babbel supporter Jens Lehmann, "when there is a new impetus in football, sometimes things happen that you would not have thought possible".
And Sami Khedira, who after weeks of injury-related absence, has become the best player on the pitch thanks to his dynamic, tried to describe the "phenomenon" observed with the proverbial "fresh wind" and the way of working of the new supervisor: "He is a man who is aggressive and demands discipline.
This is what we need in the current situation".
Under Babbel had obviously missed it.
The VfB Stuttgart is not over the mountain, warns sports director Horst Heldt
But VfB Stuttgart needs Konstanz first and foremost.
Like Gross, players and managers were careful not to overestimate the victory against a defensive team of Romanian guests, who were weakened by substitutes and were completely overwhelmed.
They would have won in Glasgow too, before the bad news came four days later in Leverkusen at 0:4 on the grid, Khedira said.
And sports director Horst Heldt warned that while one season goal had been reached, the other was still far off.
We're not over the mountain yet.
Heldt was not in the mood to celebrate his 40th birthday, even after the first home win in three months, because of the events of the weekend, which were revived in the form of a television interview broadcast by goalkeeper Jens Lehmann immediately before the game began.
There are decisions that others make and not Jens, countered Hero the harsh criticism of Lehmann.
He had accused the board of leadership weakness and decided to change coach under pressure from the pubescent fans.
Lehmann also considered that the fact that his day off was cut after games was a sign of lack of sovereignty and displeasure.
Lehmann's statements were "marked by pure selfishness", Heldt replied, and announced consequences for the finalist.
I don't think they're gonna be friends for life, the two 40-year-olds.
But they agreed with everyone else that without the preparation by the coaching staff, the strong and combative performance would not have been possible.
Babbel and his assistants would have "a big part of the success", said Heldt and Lehmann in unison - and the man with the plastic bag agreed.
WM-Fight in the heavyweight division
Hot duel in Bern: Again and again challenger Kevin Johnson provoked world champion Vitali Klitschko with words and gestures.
But after 12 hard rounds, the Ukrainian defended his WBC heavyweight title.
The judges' verdict was unanimous.
Vitali Klitschko is still the heavyweight boxing champion of the world.
The 38-year-old champion according to the WBC Association defeated the American Kevin Johnson unanimously in Bern on Saturday night (120:108, 120:108, 119:109).
For Klitschko, it was the third successful title defense after his comeback in October 2008.
Previously, the Ukrainian was already a two-time world champion of the WBO and WBC associations.
Unfortunately, the knockout we all expected didn't work out.
Klitschko built his record to 39 wins in 41 professional fights, twice he had to give up due to injuries.
Challenger Johnson suffered his first defeat in the 24th fight.
In front of some 17,000 spectators in the Bern Arena, the 2.02 meter tall Klitschko wanted to dictate the fight mainly with his left hand.
The eleven centimeters smaller Johnson, who had announced the end of the Klitschko era before the duel, but repeatedly escaped the blows of the world champion, so that Klitschko could not decisively bring his dangerous right into the finish.
Overall, the passive Johnson did too little for a challenger and only tried to make ends meet.
Although he provoked Klitschko with words and gestures, his blows rarely hit the world champion.
After all, he is only the second boxer after Timo Hoffmann in 2000 to have gone over the full distance of twelve laps with Klitschko.
The challenger had caused some turmoil before the fight in the Swiss capital.
He called Klitschko an "ugly zombie" who "can't do anything right".
On Friday, the champion was provoked into pushing Johnson's sunglasses off his nose "to see his eyes".
Fourth win after Klitschko's comeback
Klitschko also remained victorious in his fourth fight after his comeback on October 11, 2008.
After almost four years of absence, he had defeated the Nigerian Samuel Peter in Berlin and recovered "his" WBC belt, which he had previously had to give up without a fight.
In that year, he then defeated Juan Carlos Gomez of Cuba in his title defenses and in September Chris Arreola of the United States.
I only took one punch in this fight and I'm in great shape physically, Klitschko had said, justifying his quick return to the ring.
But his dream remains the unification of all four important titles in the family.
Brother Vladimir is world champion of the WBO and IBF.
The WBA belt is held by the Briton David Haye, who was able to dethrone the 2.13-meter Nikolai Valuyev in November.
Haye had previously called off a fight against Vitali Klitschko scheduled for September this summer.
Allegedly, his promotion company is already planning the fight against Klitschko at Wembley Stadium in London.
The Kunduz case
Opposition frontal attack: Green Party leader Jürgen Trittin has called Defence Minister Guttenberg a liar for providing false information on the Kunduz affair.
The SPD and the Left are demanding clarification from the Chancellor.
The Commission has already submitted a proposal for a directive on the protection of the financial interests of the European Union.
The minister had said "knowingly the untruth" about the deadly bombing of two tankers in September, said the Green Party leader Jürgen Trittin on the ARD news programme "Tagesschau" on Saturday.
It's called "he lied".
The order to kill was given in violation of the rules of the International Security Force in Afghanistan (ISAF).
The European Union has a duty to help the people of Europe to find a way out of the present crisis.
On Friday, it became known that the attack was not only about the destruction of the hijacked trucks, but also about the targeted killing of two Taliban leaders.
The US airstrike ordered by German Kunduz commander Colonel Klein killed or wounded up to 142 people, according to a NATO investigation report.
On Saturday, the Greens, the SPD and the Left called on Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) to speak out immediately before the Bundestag and also to clarify what Guttenberg really knew about the incident.
The European Parliament has already adopted a resolution on the situation in Afghanistan, calling for the EU to take action to combat the violence in Afghanistan and for the EU to take action to combat the violence in Afghanistan.
The government spokesman, Ulrich Wilhelm, flatly rejected the criticism.
He said that the Chancellery had not influenced the German Armed Forces' operations in Afghanistan.
On Saturday, doubts were also raised about the Ministry's account of the reasons for the dismissal of Inspector General Wolfgang Schneiderhan and State Secretary Peter Wichert.
According to SPIEGEL, the two Guttenbergs have correctly and completely informed the public about the background of the tanker attack.
Officially, it was said that they had denied the existence of the NATO reports and withheld sensitive details from the minister.
However, the two top officials said that they had even referred the Ministry of Defense to several reports, including a two-page document by the commanding Colonel Klein and a field hunter report.
The German newspaper "Frankfurter Allgemeiner Sonntagszeitung" reported that Wichert had written to the German authorities asking for clarification of the situation.
He has not received an answer, so far, they say.
The ministry did not comment on the allegations on Saturday and pointed out that this would be clarified in the Bundestag's committee of inquiry, which is to be constituted next Wednesday.
The worlds of dreams
Some people in their waking state see images and hear voices that others do not see or hear.
It's not just in the case of the mentally ill and the drug addicts that the lines between imagination and reality blur.
As long as it's in your sleep, it's fine.
When we lie with our eyes closed in our dark rooms, we are free to indulge in the wildest imaginations and fantasies.
But in the modern Western world, those who experience a dreamlike state while awake, see and hear things that others do not see or hear, are usually considered crazy or addicted to drugs, or at least strange.
But such images and voices are not limited to the mentally ill or to drug addicts.
It's our imagination: the same neural processes that allow us to design houses, paint pictures, or write novels sometimes blur the lines between dreams, delusions, and reality.
Traumatic altered states of consciousness can occur in a variety of forms, at best we call them visions, at worst we call them delusions.
Although the causes and effects may differ, the visions of the mystic Hildegard of Bingen, the drug experiences of the New Age prophet Carlos Castaneda, the shamanic states of rapture, psychosis and hallucinations can be traced back to similar processes.
Hallucinations or delusions occur when the balance of the brain's neurotransmitters - primarily dopamine, norepinephrine, serotonin, and acetylcholine - is disturbed and the interaction of different parts of the brain is disrupted.
Complex hallucinations and delusional thoughts are very common during schizophrenic psychosis.
Gravity has no power over him anymore.
The connection between delusion and dream has occupied philosophers and physicians since ancient times.
Aristotle considered hallucinations to be a form of waking dream, Wilhelm Griesinger, one of the founders of modern psychiatry, noted in 1861 a "great similarity of the insane with dream states", for Sigmund Freud the dream was even "a psychosis, with all the inconsistencies, delusions, delusions of such".
It's the fall of 2001, when Henning T. turns into a cartoon character.
His body is two-dimensional and quietschbunt.
Gravity has no power over him, he's floating on the ceiling.
He feels a kick.
Behind him, winged devils with blood-red, distorted foreheads, grinding teeth.
They chase him, kick him with heavy, flaming boots, throw him against the walls, he feels the pain all over his body.
Loud, vicious voices are coming from the walls and the radio.
He can't stand them anymore, the voices that insult him and insult him.
Henning T. rips two cables from the stereo system, knots them into a loop, and attaches them to a hook on the ceiling.
He gets on a loudspeaker and puts the noose around his neck.
Jump up.
The noose is loosening.
Let this be a lesson to you, the voices in a drum-beating chorus, "go to the clinic and let yourself be cured!"
Today Henning T. is 40 years old, he has experienced six acute psychosis, the last one was two years ago, the first one almost 20 years ago.
It was triggered by LSD.
He's been diagnosed with schizo-affective-paranoid psychosis, and he's also manic-depressive, and he's on medication for depression, mania, schizophrenia.
He's learned to live with his illness, he's been married for three years.
"In psychosis I have experienced the worst fear and the deepest despair", he says.
The illusions are a cruel reality
About 1 percent of the population will develop schizophrenia at least once in their lives, and in psychiatric hospitals, it is the second most common disorder after depression.
In acute schizophrenic psychosis, the affected person is usually unable to distinguish between the internal and external world, and they fall into an over-excited state that can lead to hallucinations, delusions of grandeur, delusions of relationship or persecution.
Especially common is the hearing of voices - voices that command, comment, or dialogue.
Optical hallucinations are not uncommon either.
The person is unable to distinguish between what is important and what is unimportant, the brain is unable to filter out disturbing signals, and the mind is flooded with impressions.
Like dreams, psychosis opens the floodgates to a flood of ideas and fantasies that originate in deeper layers of consciousness.
The perception of reality in psychosis is subject-centered, says Professor Thomas Fuchs, chief physician of the Department of General Psychiatry at the University Hospital Heidelberg.
The schizophrenic is at the centre of the action, everything has a meaning directed at him.
At the same time, he is in a passive role, he is, like in a dream, overwhelmed by events and cannot actively shape them.
Schizophrenics therefore often feel threatened, controlled and manipulated.
They are often unable to reconcile reality, and the delusions are a cruel reality, beyond awakening.
Having experienced a hallucination once in a lifetime
Unlike in dreams, says Fuchs, "the sensory and spatial structure of reality perceived in psychosis is fundamentally preserved".
The delusions and hallucinations are rooted in reality, the alienation of experience takes place in the real frame.
Why our brain is so capricious is still a mystery to researchers.
"Extraordinary circumstances can cause any person to lose touch with reality for a short time", says Fuchs.
But not everyone will develop psychosis.
There seems to be a genetic predisposition to schizophrenia, but twin studies have shown that genes are not the only determining factors.
Researchers believe that those affected have minimal brain damage.
We suspect that the brain's neural maturation is disrupted early in development, for example by a viral illness of the mother during pregnancy, explains Fuchs.
But it remains a mystery how the disruption of the neuronal system comes about, and how it does not manifest itself for many years.
Environmental factors also play a role - stress or traumatic experiences can be triggers for psychosis if the disposition is present.
Hallucinogenic drugs can also cause psychosis, because they interfere with the transmitter system.
When Our Brains Are Hot
The crazy thing is, psychotics suffer from their hallucinations and take expensive medications to get rid of them, while others spend money on drugs to get them, says Lübeck psychology professor Erich Kasten.
Whether a delusion is pleasing or unpleasant is often just a matter of perspective.
Kasten has been collecting reports on hallucinations and delusions for ten years, and last year he published his findings in the book "The Unreal World in Our Minds".
While hallucinations are a common symptom of psychosis, they are also a symptom of a surprisingly large number of other illnesses.
These include mental disorders such as borderline or depression, but also often include diseases such as migraines, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis or Alzheimer's and traumatic brain injuries.
Surprisingly, under certain conditions, even the brains of healthy people hallucinate.
Hallucinations, such as boxes, are composed of memory contents that are normally retained.
They are produced when areas of the brain that process sensory information are overactive or under-activated, when our brains are overworked, or when there is a lack of stimulation.
Drugs can cause this condition in the same way that brain damage or psychosis can.
But also withdrawal, stress, heartbreak, or other mental states of exception.
In recent studies, up to one third of the people surveyed said they had experienced a hallucination at least once in their life.
In the summer of 2005, Sarah K. is 16 years old, lives in a small town in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern and attends high school there.
Just a normal girl, really.
If it weren't for the pictures and the voices.
During the break, a sloppy boy with long, dark hair may approach.
When he answers, the other students look on in surprise - no one else sees or hears this boy.
You think the shy girl is a dreamy, dreamy girl, but Sarah K. isn't dreaming, she knows that.
She's awake, she hears and sees this boy, just like she hears and sees the girl in the bank next to her.
She can even sense his presence, at least for a moment.
It's a nice feeling, she likes the boy.
Am I crazy? she sometimes asks herself.
But she knows that this boy and the other illusions are not real and will disappear again.
At night, the apparitions are mostly frightening.
Often the illusions are also a burden.
When she is in the classroom, she is sometimes unable to follow the lesson because the teacher is introducing a new classmate to her eyes and ears while he explains mathematical equations on the blackboard to all the others.
At night, the apparitions are usually frightening.
When she is in her dark room waiting for sleep, which comes too seldom and too late, she often cannot tell whether she is awake or already dreaming, whether the images she sees are of the faces or the girl with the bleeding cuts on her arms and legs, whether they are of her eyes open or closed.
Leave me alone, she's yelling at the figures.
She won't tell her parents or friends, they'll think she's crazy.
Sarah K. is 20 years old today.
She passed the Abitur last year and lives with her boyfriend.
The hallucinations stopped a year ago.
Ever since she contacted the psychologist Kasten on the Internet, she knows she's not crazy.
Delusion is also a work of art out of despair
If a person is socially isolated or suffers from withdrawal, he is more likely to experience hallucinations after a while, says Kasten.
I suspect the brain is under-employed and is taking care of its own entertainment.
Sarah K., an only child, was afraid of other children when she was a little girl, often playing alone.
Her hallucinations began when she was 13 years old and discovered that the man she had called "Daddy" since she could think was not her biological father.
Since the same brain areas that process real impressions and sounds are active in visual and auditory hallucinations, sufferers like Sarah K. have difficulty distinguishing between illusions and reality. "Every experience", says Kasten, "is in the brain, and reality is formed there.
Hallucinations are also images that the brain creates, which is why they seem so real".
Night vision also considers caste as a form of hallucination.
The hallucinations of healthy people are not fundamentally different from those of an acute psychosis.
Unlike schizophrenics, mentally healthy people are able to recognize their delusions as unreal.
Kasten advises his patients to consider hallucinations as a special ability.
The borderline between dream and hallucination
In our world, which is too focused on consciousness, imaginary experience is unfortunately often pathologised, says Michael Schmidt-Degenhard, professor in Heidelberg and chief physician of the clinic for psychiatry and psychotherapy at the Florence Nightingale Hospital in Düsseldorf.
Psychosis is a painful, painful disease, but it also has positive, creative aspects -- delusion is also a work of art out of desperation.
Schmidt-Degenhard has researched the so-called oneiroid form of experience, a special form of traumatically altered waking consciousness.
Oneiroids are highly complex, detailed quasi-dreams that the experiencer believes to be real and which, even in retrospect, cannot be distinguished from the waking state.
The oneiroid state of consciousness occurs in extreme trauma or disease-related situations, for example in polyradiculite patients who experience motor paralysis while fully conscious.
When a person is threatened with loss of self and world, for example by permanent, complete immobility, he replaces the life-threatening real situation with a separate, imaginary world that is disconnected from reality, says Schmidt-Degenhard.
It's a borderline state between dream and hallucination.
Since it is not possible to cope with a situation in reality, a world change takes place, but the real situation is made present in the imagination.
An intensive form of meaning-making and meaning-giving in a situation that is intolerable in itself, which allows us humans to have our own creative capacity, not to be submerged in a nothingness of loss of consciousness.
Everything is real, even in the memory later
The Zurich art historian Peter Cornelius Claussen also describes his Oneiroid experiences in his book "Heart-change" as a soul-saving action.
At the age of 49, after heart valve surgery and subsequent heart transplant, his consciousness travels for days while his body is condemned to immobility in the intensive care unit.
Claussen dives into a self-created world, visits strange times and places: he experiences himself as a bedridden old man, on board a train sanatorium, a robot watches over his health.
He lives in the early Middle Ages among nobles who make drugs from blood.
Taken by a Greek man on a motorcycle to his homeland, he surfs his hospital bed in the alpine snow and meets a Korean mafioso.
He is completely absorbed in the imaginary event, everything is real, even later in memory.
These inner journeys are fundamentally different from any dream for Claussen.
Dreams are a different state, he describes his experience.
In contrast, the memories of my mental journeys are still vivid to me after years and in minor details.
More vivid and intense than anything I've ever experienced.
The intensity of this experience blows the horizon of our other life experiences, says psychiatrist Schmidt-Degenhard.
Finally, oneroids, psychosis, hallucinations, and drug addiction demonstrate how fragile our inner images of external reality are even in the waking state.
Any alteration in the state of consciousness, sums up psychologist Kasten, "can lead to a distortion of what we call reality".
An experience that can be very enriching.
The snowfall may come
Burda
Children are supposed to take over the publishing house at 27
The new editor-in-chief Kallen is an interim solution: in the long term, Hubert Burda wants to hand over his company to his two children, he told SPIEGEL.
The holding company will remain 100% family-owned.
Hamburg - Publisher Hubert Burda sees his company in the hands of his children in the long term.
Both children inherit at 27 and have the firm will to enter the company, the 69-year-old told SPIEGEL.
We've arranged the details for you.
The question whether they are also active in the company arises only afterwards.
And the question of whether they can do it.
You cannot put your children in front of 7,500 employees if they are not well equipped.
It's killing the kids and the company.
On Thursday, Burda announced that he would step down as CEO in January and appointed Paul-Bernhard Kallen as his successor.
Kallen, 52, has been a member of the Burda board since 1999.
He was first in charge of technology.
Later, the Treasury Department was given responsibility for the company's assets and, after the departure of Jürgen Todenhöfer, also for direct marketing, foreign trade, printing and finance.
This is the first time that a family member is not in charge of the publishing house.
Burda's children are 19 and 17 years old, his son Felix, who would be 42 years old today, died some years ago.
The naming of Kallen also serves to "bridge 10, 15 years", says Burda.
The holding company should remain 100% family-owned, Burda said.
With regard to the Schickdanz and Schaeffler cases, Burda said that family businesses are not safe from collapse either: 'This was always the case for families who were infected by a capitalist addiction, who were completely speculative and thought that they could become a big player.
That was never my strategy.
He had "no world power dreams", according to Burda.
I don't see myself as the political preceptor of this country, like Springer was, and I don't want to play in the World League with Time, these stores have gotten too big.
Perfect beauty
Everything you desire in terms of beauty and well-being is now at your disposal.
At least that is what El Corte Inglés has done, recently opening a store of over 1000 m2 in the Callao shopping centre in Madrid, where everything is about personal hygiene.
The wellness area, located on the eighth floor, is home to several well-known companies, including Hedonai, which offers laser hair removal; Spaxión, which has spaces for relaxation and beauty treatments; the Luis & Tachi hairdressers, Marina d'Or with a fitness studio, and L'Occitane with its natural cosmetics.
There is also a food section, which stands out for its tea house with over 130 different teas.
A relaxing massage with your partner and a fantastic view of the capital, or renting the relaxation area for two hours to have your own 'beauty party' with eight friends and then relaxing in the whirlpool or with massages and a glass of champagne are just some of the options offered by Spaxión.
The total area is 250 m2, divided into 12 rooms for the latest facial and body treatments and for hydrotherapy.
For example, cavitation in the fight against cellulitis or with vibrating surfaces.
The gym also has this kind of equipment, and there are also virtual trainers who take care of the training sessions of the customers and thus offer them a completely personalized training.
You start a training session by entering a personal password on a touch screen opposite the devices.
Then, you will see various videos that show you how to do your workouts properly.
The head of the gym says that 15 minutes (including warm-up and stretching) is enough to train the body muscles.
And if you're looking for a hair salon after working out your body, Luis & Tachi has a room where they offer treatments to restore the beauty, shine and health of your hair in a personalized way.
Innovation and exclusivity seem to be the key words for this spa in the heart of the city, which is open from 10 a.m. to 10 p.m. 365 days a year.
The most varied of decolletés
Christmas is getting closer and closer, so it's a good opportunity to copy the look of the stars and bring their festive dresses to our wardrobe.
The shape of the neckline, which is very important for emphasizing the silhouette, is one of the points to be considered.
Here are some suggestions.
The singer Fergie has chosen an exaggerated and very complicated décolleté.
Endesa and Barcelona by electric car
The electricity company Endesa has created the "LIVE office" in conjunction with the city of Barcelona.
The project is aimed at developing and promoting the electric car in the Catalan capital.
The 'LIVE Office' (Logistics for the introduction of the electric car) will define and coordinate the roadmap for the introduction of the electric car in the city and make arrangements for mobility by managing, coordinating, subsidizing, etc.
On the other hand, the MOVELE project is being developed to promote the electric car and to bring together the opinions and measures of the sectors concerned.
This is an attempt to drive the transport of the future forward.
3 'electric cities'
However, Barcelona is not the only city that will be involved in the introduction of the electric car in Spain.
Madrid and Seville are also participating in this project.
These are the three cities that the government has selected as part of the MOVELE project to accelerate the adoption of electric cars.
The electricity company Endesa has already signed a framework contract with the Government of Catalonia (la Generalitat).
The framework contract is intended to promote research and technological development activities in the Autonomous Community of Catalonia.
These activities include those activities related to energy and in particular to its efficiency.
It is not, however, the only initiative in which Endesa is involved in promoting the electric car.
The company is involved in standardisation groups throughout Europe and has a number of additional projects such as G4V, ELVIRE and CENIT VERDE.
Zapatero sees 'a horizon of calm' for the automotive sector
The President of the Government, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, has called for a "horizon of calm" for the Spanish automobile industry, which is the country's largest exporter.
The President of the Government, presenting the 2009 Economic Report, recalled the measures taken by the Government to support the automotive sector during the year.
"Without the plan for the competitiveness of the car industry, we would have a panorama of neglect and closure of some of our main production plants", the Prime Minister explained.
"Thanks to this plan and the willingness of the car manufacturers to continue to produce in Spain in a very competitive industry, we can see a calm horizon for the emergence of this industry, which is our main export industry", he added.
He also recalled that the Competitiveness Plan, which is part of the Automotive Industry Overall Plan (PIA), provided EUR 800 million for projects of 19 vehicle manufacturers and 137 suppliers, which in turn led to investments of more than EUR 3 billion.
The Head of Government stated that these investments are intended both for the development of new models and for the modernisation of existing products and processes.
Zapatero also highlighted the government's measures to stimulate demand, in the context of Plan 2000E, which are being implemented in cooperation with the autonomous communities and the car manufacturers.
According to the head of government, this plan allows the emissions of new vehicles sold on the Spanish market to be reduced by an average of 6%, which in turn led to a "strong increase" in registrations, which rose by "40%" in November.
The 20 000 square metres of classic vehicles
Madrid is hosting the first edition of the International Classic Motor Show, an exhibition for professionals and enthusiasts of the world of engines.
This fair will take place from 5 to 7 February 2010 in the Pabellón de Cristal of the Casa de Campo in Madrid.
The exhibition will be held in a 20,000 square metre exhibition area, where 200 national and international exhibitors will be presenting their brands.
In addition to classic motorcycles and vehicles, you will find all the items you can imagine relating to the world of motorcycles at ClassicAuto Madrid.
The exhibitors at the fair include accessories, spare parts, components, fabric accessories, accessories, publications, miniature cars and so on.
Hundreds of items from the world of classic engines that will delight collectors and enthusiasts.
The companies that will be present at the fair include Clásicos de Mos and Good Old Times, car sales; Juan Lumbreras, restoration; Coupe-Francisco Pueche, car sales and restoration, specialising in Mercedes Benz.
Outdoor skills tests
In addition, the sales activities at this fair are supplemented by parallel events: meetings, sports car exhibitions, skill tests, events and competitions.
The competition is also open to the public, and is organised by the European Commission.
Mazda3 i-Stop: Sporty and environmentally friendly
Mazda wants to prove that sporting activity is compatible with environmental protection.
This is why Mazda recently introduced the i-Stop, the engine's automatic stop and approach system, in the Mazda3 model, a device that is currently only available for the 2.0 petrol engine with 150 hp.
This second generation of the Mazda 3 stands out for its good overall rating.
The final design, the vehicle's design, the comfort, its handling, the mechanics, the i-stop system...
All these aspects are "very good" in the new Mazda3.
Starting with the front seats, you can see that the front seats offer excellent ergonomics and good grip.
Furthermore, the steering wheel is excellent.
Looking further at the unit, which consists of the instrument panel and the dashboard, it can be seen that Mazda, with a multitude of buttons and switches in the striking colors red and blue, is in line with the Japanese trend towards a futuristic interior design.
This style reminds us in part of the style of the Honda Civic.
It is therefore clear that both the Mazda 3 and the Civic, both Japanese models, stand out from the sobriety of German automobiles, especially the Volkswagen Golf, which everyone wants to surpass.
The passenger compartment of these two Japanese compact cars offers more comfort than ever before, so that four adults can ride in the car in the utmost comfort.
In addition to all this, there is a large and clearly formed trunk.
The stop and start system is so far only available for the 2-litre petrol engine with 150 hp and a 6-speed transmission.
This engine is a real treat, distinguished by its delicacy, its quietness, its performance and its low consumption.
And all those who do not drive many kilometres a year should consider this i-Stop with petrol engine because of its great comfort in gear and its low consumption, even if Mazda is mainly the best-selling diesel models.
The so-called Sport model selected for the test drive is a special feature in terms of equipment, as it has a much larger number of elements from the standard equipment.
The standard equipment includes the RVM (Ride-View Variable Assist) which eliminates the blind spot, traction and stability controls, speed control, the light-sensitive interior mirror, the large-screen computer, parking sensors, an independent air conditioning system, rain and light sensors, Bluetooth and Audio-Bluetooth, and the chrome-plated 17-inch wheels.
In addition, as if this were not enough, this version also includes the Premium package, which includes the following for an additional 1,500 euros: among other elements, the Bixenon headlights and the BOSE sound system with CD loader.
Conclusion
The Mazda3 2.0 i-Stop is one of the best compact cars in its class.
It is particularly outstanding in terms of the materials used, its driving behaviour and the variety of its equipment.
In addition, those who do not travel many kilometres a year can also buy the i-Stop version, which is only available with a 2.0 petrol engine with 150 hp.
The only negative about this model is its somewhat high price, which is between 21,770 euros for the Luxury model and 23,270 euros for the test-driven Sporty model.
In return for this high price, the Mazda3 offers us the greatest driving pleasure ever.
A premiere with a lot of glamour
L.A. rolls out the red carpet of sensuality for Penelope Cruz, Nicole Kidman and Fergie.
At the premiere of "Nine", the stars, dressed in models that look as elegant as they are sexy, shone more than ever.
Our "Pe", as elegant as ever, chose a dark "lady" dress.
The promises of FonPeek
Peek is extremely limited, a device that can only read your e-mail without any way of seeing certain attachments or browsing the Internet.
It enjoyed its five minutes of fame when Time magazine selected it as one of the products of the year.
It is unlikely to be seen on the streets, but the idea is still of interest, especially to young people.
Unlike smartphones, Peek is very low-cost and has a very low flat rate, for example, only half the price of the flat rate of an iPhone.
After seeing the success of this, the company launched two new devices: one that's just for Twitter, the other that's a lifetime free data service, unlike the Peek, which is six times more expensive.
The Fonpeek, which was presented yesterday at Le Web, is the European version of this invention and thus its third version.
It has the same limitations as its American counterpart, but it has a surprise in store.
The monthly subscription for the phone, about 12 euros a month, includes roaming for all of Europe.
Those who travel the world with a smartphone already know what it means to have to give up all your data in order to read your emails once you cross the border or when you desperately look for a cafe with Wi-Fi (or a connection with a phone).
The idea of roaming with flat rates is incredibly tempting and should have been possible a long time ago.
It's true that some telephone companies already offer special contracts and rates for stays abroad, but in my experience you need a PhD in physics and good glasses to read all the fine print.
The repeated criticism from the European Commission of affordable roaming charges for all of Europe has almost always gone unheeded.
Outside of your own country, you're always afraid to read your emails, and rightly so.
That a small device like FonPeek (which is amazing that it has the name Fon, even though it doesn't have Wi-Fi/WLAN) can offer these kinds of rates means that phone companies are slowly but surely having to rethink and start considering different ways to use their data network.
Kindle is another good example, and its prices include downloading books and other requests from the Internet.
No hooks and no hooks.
It's an Internet-enabled device, and you only pay for it once, at the time of purchase, not month after month.
And that's exactly what I hope to see from FonPeek one day, a lifetime purchase option like the one that Peek already offers in the United States.
And not because I want to buy it.
I'll read my e-mails on my phone, thanks.
I expect this because I think it would be a more appropriate model for the consumer.
It would be interesting to see a computer with the same system.
The color of Michelle's fetish
Yellow is, without a doubt, the favorite color of the First Lady of the United States.
When Barack Obama became President of the United States, she wore a dress and a coat of this color and chose the same color to accompany him in what was undoubtedly the second most important moment of his life: the awarding of the Nobel Peace Prize in Oslo.
Michelle Obama wore very similar designs on both occasions: except that it was almost the same color - a shiny grayish-blue - the dress was made of three parts - a dress, a jacket and a coat of the same material, and she wore something with a coarse embroidery or a necklace.
In fact, it seems at first sight that the First Lady of the United States wanted to follow the example of the Princess of Asturias and decided to wear the same dress on more than one occasion.
However, the two dresses differ greatly in the material from which they are made.
At the inauguration she wore a dress made of lace and in Oslo a patterned velvet one.
The accessories were also different: the first time green shoes with half-heels and the second time, although a slim model, but gold.
The hairstyle was also different each time: The hair was up on this occasion as a wreath, on the previous one it was open.
75% of working mothers have experienced problems at work because of their motherhood
Discrimination in employment has increased in recent years, especially among younger women who want to have children.
This is the conclusion of the study "Fertility and Careers of Women in Spain", carried out by CSIC in collaboration with the Women's Institute.
The survey of 9,737 women aged 15 to 75 leaves no doubt about this: 75% of women in employment see their career opportunities on the labour market as being restricted by their motherhood.
The study reveals that there are wide differences in the decision to start a family and the number of children depending on whether women work or not and if so, what type of occupation they have.
Those of them who do not work outside the home, who work part-time or who do not have a fixed contract of employment are more likely to become mothers and have more children.
In contrast, women in permanent employment, especially in the public sector, postpone the establishment of a family and motherhood and therefore have fewer children.
"The average duration of first childbirth for women in the 35-49 age group with a fixed job is 3.7 years after moving in together, rising to 4.1 years for women with a fixed job, who took longer to do so and who moved in together and had their first child much later.
In addition, the nature of work also has a major impact on motherhood, although less so than the calendar in terms of readiness for conception", explains CSIC researcher Margarita Delgado.
The level of education is another factor to be taken into account in the age of women at marriage and at the first child.
According to the survey, the higher the level of education, the higher the age at the time of marriage and the first child.
This difference was also observed in women of the same age.
For example, the women in the group between 35 and 49 years old, depending on whether they had only a high school diploma or a higher education, became mothers for the first time at an average of 25.1 or 32.1 respectively.
There is also another difference between women, depending on their level of education.
While women with a high school diploma marry before their first permanent job and have their first child, women with a medium or high school diploma do the opposite, seeking a permanent job and marrying before they have their first child, Delgado notes.
Diane Kruger is worth it too
L'Oréal Paris recently added a new name to its much-envied roster of female ambassadors: Diane Kruger.
From next year, the German actress will be the image of various products of the brand and will also say the well-known advertising slogan "Because you are worth it".
The leading lady in Joyeux Noël, one of the most elegant actresses on the international stage, will become another famous figure, as Linda Evangelista, Jane Fonda, Andie MacDowell, Eva Longoria and the Spanish actress Penélope Cruz have done before her.
The last people to join this exclusive club before her were the actresses Evangeline Lilly ("Lost") and Freida Pinto ("Slumdog Millionaire").
The cosmetics company also has only exceptional ambassadors for men: Patrick Dempsey ("Grey's Anatomy") and Matthew Fox (Evangeline's acting partner in "Lost").
The British fashion industry's awards
The British have a big say in the fashion world.
Their top representatives - fashion designers and models, both past and present - met at the annual awards ceremony held in London's Royal Court of Justice.
They had all come for the occasion.
Ex-model Jerry Hall and her daughter, Georgia May Jagger, who was named this year's top model.
The poker game of Manuel Vicent
In "Poker der Asse" (Alfaguara, illustrations by Fernando Vicente), Manuel Vicent presents the three X-ray images of writers who have accompanied him in his literary life (and, in some cases, in real life).
He does not use a predictable and frightening genre (short biography, life and work), but looks for a possibility of the glowing heart of the Creator.
The journey is exciting, and Vicent is not spared from horrors or enlightenment.
In addition to being a delightful read, this book is a moving invitation to read and re-read.
Here are some excerpts from the book.
About Albert Camus: "In reading his pages, I found that the Mediterranean was not an ocean, but rather a spiritual, almost sensual impulse, just as I had always felt it, without having found words for it: the joy in contrast to the calamitous fate, the morality without guilt and the innocence without any god".
About Samuel Beckett: "A nihilist, an allegorical Christian, he wrote about what he had in his blood, not in his mind, between powerlessness and ignorance, with a poetic sense of overwhelming humor, devoid of all meaning, like the knife that almost killed him".
About Graham Greene: "Our husband was drawn to this woman with a passion that lasted thirteen years, a spell that enchanted her, in which the flesh was joined by the emotions of adultery with the pleasure of repentance, a spiritual privilege that consisted in entering heaven by way of the bypass of perdition".
About James Joyce: "The Odyssey" was published in 1922 in Paris by Sylvia Beach, and it is one of the 8,000 peaks in world literature, one must climb the north face, the face where the best climbers try again and again".
About William Faulkner: "He was a funny fellow.
He sometimes said of himself that he was the heir of a landowner of the county, and at other times he said that he was the son of a black woman and a crocodile.
Both dreams were born of a certain gravity".
About Louis-Ferdinand Céline: This writer took up the mad cry that was shouted from a bridge by that person from Munich, so that its echo echoed deep into the night of the 20th century in his literary way, in a journey where he fled from himself and with a speech full of violence he pleaded with the world of the worms.
About Dorothy Parker: "One day she knelt down and prayed: 'Dear God, I ask you to do everything in your power to make me stop writing like a woman.'"
On Joseph Conrad: "On his grave these lines are engraved by Spencer: 'Sleep after toil,/ After the storm of the harbour,/ The calm after the war,/ After a life well spent, one finds pleasure in death".
Virginia Wolf: "She always carried her depression with her.
The husband took it with complete normality when she told him that Edward VII was spying on her among the Azaleans or the birds were singing in Greek.
There is no other case known where the man was so patient and so in love with a neurotic whose literary talent was much greater than her madness".
About Pío Baroja: "What was Martín-Santos doing other than trying to get Joyce into Baroja?
What was Benet's intention if he didn't lead Baroja to the weapons of Faulkner?
What did Cela do, except destroy the glory of that man, so that he could put himself on this podium?"
Cowardly aggression
My mother, who is 70 years old, was walking in our neighborhood in Fuenlabrada last week when suddenly a group of young people between 15 and 18 years old ran alongside her and our dog, a mixed breed dog we had brought from the animal shelter, weighing only six kilos, and then out of nowhere they missed him by two feet and seriously injured him.
Our indignation is beyond words, because it is incomprehensible to us, since what fun is there in a cheap aggression against a small and helpless animal, which was of course executed on a leash.
In addition to the choking attack that a woman who was taking a leisurely walk suffered when she tried to correct these people for the incident, she even feared for her own life, because if such a maniac attacks a dog, he may do the same to a woman, a child, an elderly gentleman or probably even to anyone weaker than himself.
The incident occurred in a normally quiet area of the city at five o'clock in the afternoon on a normal Tuesday.
The dog has been howling all day.
Of course, we filed a complaint at a nearby police station, but we have serious doubts whether this will be of any use, and to avoid any prejudice from the outset, we would like to clarify that the cowardly criminals were Spanish.
Our outrage at what happened has prompted us to report this incident.
We cannot understand what must be going on in the minds of these young people, that they find a cheap attack on a helpless animal amusing, on an animal that gives us love, companionship and friendship.
We do not know where the good manners and respect for animals and people have gone.
Michelin and Fesvial together for the use of the helmet
The tyre manufacturer Michelin has launched a campaign to promote the use of helmets, especially among younger motorcyclists, in cooperation with the Spanish Foundation for Road Safety (Fesvial), both companies announced today.
The initiative aims to raise awareness of the importance of wearing a helmet, which is the only protective element that can prevent head injuries and even death in the event of a motorcycle accident.
Michelin pointed out that this campaign is part of its commitment to road safety, which "goes far beyond the design and manufacture of products that are safer every day", and stressed that it is also contributing to this goal by other actions of an educational and informative nature.
This new campaign to promote the use of helmets on motorcycles, under the slogan 'To be or not to be', will distribute posters to over 500 motorcycle shops in an initial phase, in order to achieve the best possible dissemination.
In conclusion, Michelin stressed that road safety is 'a constant concern' of the company, and this is precisely because, as a manufacturer of tyres for two-wheel vehicles, it always sees itself committed to the development of ever safer products as one of its main objectives.
Sales of small trucks are rising again
After almost two years, the small-car market is finally beginning to see some light at the end of the dark tunnel.
The 9,425 vehicles registered in Spain in November represent an increase of 12.6% on 2008 and, more importantly, the first increase after 22 consecutive months of steady decline, according to figures provided by the manufacturers' association Anfac and the car dealers' association Ganvam.
However, these good figures are to be enjoyed with great caution at the moment, as the reference data used for comparison are those of November 2008, which was a particularly bad year for sales, with a decrease of 60% compared to the previous year.
However, it should be borne in mind that, apart from the increase in the last month, the total registrations of these 11 months are still 40% below the sales figures of the previous financial year.
A total of 95,853 vehicles have been sold since January, but this figure includes all the vehicles that make up the van market: passenger van, pick-up, van, small van and lighter van/chassis.
The same storm clouds are still in the air, and they are the ones that are affecting demand the most, because even though some of the vehicles are bought by private individuals, the bulk of sales are to small and medium-sized enterprises, which in almost 100% of all cases purchase with third-party financing.
The Commission has also been able to demonstrate that the Community's financial instruments are not being used to finance the restructuring of the steel industry.
In this scenario, and unlike the passenger car, financial support has not helped much in the purchase of a vehicle of the Plan 2000E.
This scheme is not just for private individuals, however, self-employed people and small businesses are also eligible if they want to buy a small van up to 3.5 tonnes with a CO2 emission not exceeding 160 grams per kilometre, but the low sales figures speak for themselves.
Just yesterday Ganvam again reminded the public that it was essential that the state should pay special attention to these small lorries and, of course, to industrial vehicles (trucks and buses).
The Association of Automobile Dealers forecasts 2010 to be similar to the year just ended, for which it expects a 19% drop in sales (for passenger cars and SUVs).
Assisting with braking manoeuvres in critical situations is now mandatory
As with the antilock braking system (ABS) in the past and as with the ESP stability control system now, emergency braking systems must become compulsory in European cars.
In fact, they are already mandatory for all newly registered cars and light vans, with a grace period until the end of February 2011 for the remaining vehicles.
The measure adopted by the European Union is designed to improve the protection of pedestrians, but the way these braking systems work also helps to prevent many road accidents.
The role of the emergency brake assistant is to apply more pressure to the brakes in the event of a critical braking manoeuvre, which the system detects by the brake force applied by the driver to the brake pedal.
However, this system does not exert this pressure to the end.
According to a study commissioned by the manufacturer of components for Bosch vehicles, one third of the drivers involved in an accident had not even reached the brake pedal before the collision, and half had not brake at full speed.
Up to 1,100 accidents
The brake assist system, on the other hand, works its way into the braking system with maximum force, thus reducing the braking time and thus the braking distance a car travels when braking.
According to an EU study, up to 1100 fatal accidents involving pedestrians could be prevented each year if all cars were equipped with this type of emergency brake assistant.
There would be even fewer accidents - it is estimated that one in four accidents with personal injury could be prevented - once so-called intelligent emergency braking systems become popular.
Then the vehicle is equipped with a system that detects obstacles (by radar or a camera) and warns the driver, while at the same time applying a slight pressure on the brakes.
If the driver responds, the system will help him to increase the pressure on the brake pedal if necessary.
If the driver does not respond to the warning and even if the collision is inevitable, the brake assistant applies maximum pressure to the brakes to minimize damage.
General Motors is delaying the Opel plan until January .
While the Opel factory in Figueruelas (Zaragoza) has already been informed by Nick Reilly, the new president of General Motors (GM) Europe, that production of the new Meriva will start in the first week of April, probably on the 8th, according to Javier Ortega, the American carmaker points out that it needs more time to complete the rescue plan for Opel.
The new chairman of GM Europe, Nick Reilly, wants to ensure that the party concerned gives his consent to each and every point of the plan in advance.
And for that reason, the final document, which will be presented first to the workers and then to the governments of the countries where there are jobs, may be delayed until early 2010.
On the other hand, GM is assured that it will take a decision on the sale of Saab in the coming days.
It is not surprising that the Swedish government has increased pressure on the American car manufacturer to make a decision as soon as possible.
GM admits to being in contact with some potential new buyers.
One of these buyers could be Geely, which is also keen to buy Volvo, but the option of the Dutch Skyper sports car manufacturer, backed by the Russian group Converg, is gaining more and more support.
If no agreement is reached with any of these buyers, GM could sell some of its assets to BAIC in China.
The decision to close Saab by the end of the year, if it has not been sold by then, is maintained.
At the wheel of the Porsche Boxster Spyder
Using the Boxster S as a basis for their latest and very expensive jewel, the engineers succeeded in making it 80 kilos lighter, so that it now weighs only 1,275 kilos.
To do this, they first eliminated the automatic folding roof, replacing it with a hand-operated cantilever roof, saving 21 kilos; using aluminum doors like the GT3 to "disappear" another 15 kilos; removing the air conditioning system, another 13 kilos; reducing the fuel tank from 64 to 54 liters, saving another 7 kilos; installing sporty bacquet seats, another 12 kilos; and using the lightweight 19-inch wheels, another 5 kilos.
Then, by discarding the CDR-30 audio system, another six kilos were lost and the missing weight was recovered by replacing the door handles with cloth handles.
Although it is also available with the PDK dual-clutch transmission, the test drive was done with a 6-speed manual transmission vehicle, mainly on the smaller California country roads, on mountain sections that were really very curvy.
His driving is so bad, you can't give him anything but a perfect score.
But the reduction in weight has by no means meant that he would no longer be so safe on the road.
The opposite is more true: it is a long time since we have been testing a model that is so small and light, but which at the same time gives you a feeling of great safety in the corners, even at high speed.
He is a small athlete, able to warm up his muscles at a low rate of speed in the required time until we give him the commands to accelerate, to brake, to recover and then again to get everything out of his engine...
It does everything you tell it to do. This car does everything we tell it to do with our hands on the steering wheel, thanks to its steering that is as communicative as it is precise.
And he does it with the precision of a surgeon.
An engine sound for all tastes
The sound of his V6 Boxer with 320 hp (10 more than the Boxster S) is very successful and can be increased with the 'sport' option and by means of a system that can change the engine noise, which was already used for the first time in the Panamera.
The ability to accelerate is unimaginably brutal, whether from standing or from accelerating again.
The spindles are strong, but not hard or uncomfortable.
The asphalt on the country road we were driving on in the Boxster Spyder was already pretty badly damaged, but the car handled the potholes well.
The electronic assistants had almost nothing to do on the whole route, and this despite the fact that we found ice in the morning and rolls in the morning on some of these bends.
In summary, it is an ultralight car, a car that gives you an indescribable driving pleasure, which is probably rare, and it is much more than a small improvement on the Boxster Ss.
The car will be launched in February 2010 and will cost 70,831 euros.
Bag girl, you know?
The singer, a boob-busting friend of Karl Lagerfeld, is the face of the cosmetics line Coco Cocoon and an occasional starlet at the fashion shows of 'maison', she presents her evil face with the same stubbornness as her Chanel bags.
Much more than "Bad Girl" or "It Girl", she's a "Bag Girl".

Despite the many outstanding players in the team of Dusko Ivanovic, Caja Laboral celebrated an outstanding triumph with 82-91 during his visit to the complicated football field of Maccabi Electra, coming first in his group after the great performance of Mirza Teletovic, who was eight times the best of his team (29 in the rating).
The team from Vitoria was able to replace the significant failures of Herrmann, Oleson, Huertas or Micov with a large dose of commitment and teamwork, even if they had to wait for their victory until the bitter end.
The great hits from the perimeter with 16 rated triplets contributed significantly to their final victory.
The game began with the blue-red team leading the way, placing themselves at the top of the scoreboard from the start.
As the first four baskets of the Victorian team were already coming out of the perimeter, it was already possible to guess that they had come onto the field with well-warmed wrists.
It was English and Teletovic who were mainly responsible for the 18-20 at the end of the first quarter.
The second quarter was hardly different, except that the Álava team opted for an inside play by Barac and for the play of Eliyahu, who was greeted with whistles and applause on his return to the team that is his home, to continue building their advantage until the break (34-43).
Teletovic was already emerging as the best of his team with 13 points, although Splitter's "minus six" rating already suggested that this would not be the Brazilian's best night.
Nevertheless, despite the clear advantage in the break, the game was still far from being decided and the Maccabees wanted to remind the Victorians once again that not everyone wins on their playing field, and thanks to the "Hand of Elijah" that attacked again and again, they came back into the game.
Eidson and Pnini played a key role in turning the tide of the yellow team (50-49).
More Disadvantages
Ivanovic's team, injured but not dead, had to prepare a few moves with certainty to get some air and one of them suddenly came the pistol of Mirza Teletovic, who with three almost consecutive triplets and with the support of English and Ribas ensured that the consolation of the distance (54-67) was shown on the scoreboard, which the hosts could beautify at the end of the third quarter with (57-67).
The Alaves were blown out in the last quarter and English and San Emeterio (60-75) had already announced that they would not allow anyone to take away the victory they had honestly earned in the first thirty minutes.
However, Pnini and Eidson, the best of their team, did not give up and tried to give their team strength again by three points from the line (70-77).
Despite this, and despite the fact that Splitter was sent off for fouls, Ivanovic's team did not give up, defended well and although the Israelis still caught up in the last minute (80-85), the game already had a winner and Tel Aviv lost for the first time this season.
Injuries prevented Unicaja from being given the forehead
Unicaja lost to Olympiacos in Greece and had to relinquish the lead in Group B of the Euroleague to him, and this in a game marked by the absence of the players of Unicajas (Freeland, Lima and Archibald), especially in the innings, which facilitated the victory for the Greeks.
The Malaga team was not afraid of the atmosphere in the Hall of Peace and Friendship, nor of the opposing team, which is perhaps one of the strongest in Europe and has a lot of money.
The Andalusians were able to start dreaming thanks to their first-quarter play, with an aggressive defense and three consecutive trebles, two of them by Omar Cook and one by Guillem Rubio, blinding the hosts 12-18 in the ninth minute.
Olympiacos were surprised by the intensity of the Unicaja match, even though the home team, with an away game between Bourousis, Vujcic and Shortsanitis, managed to get the scoreboard to show 22-20 in their favour in the 13th minute, the minute in which it would have almost come to a brawl between the two Americans Beverley and Williams due to an action and for which both were disqualified.
The Greek team started to warm up and to show its superiority in both halves of the game, while the exit of the Englishman Joel Freeland due to an injury and the three self-inflicted errors of Carlos Jiménez left clear traces in the Unicaja.
Under their midfielder and Lithuanian forward Linas Kleizas, with his triple, they increased their lead in the 19th minute to 44-32.
A catch-up was impossible .
The third quarter was characterized by many attacks against the Olympiacos team, which despite its 19 losses proved superior and even managed to make up the difference of the game played in Málaga with 66-48 in the 27th minute, which in turn threw the lead within the group into doubt.
Unicaja tried to get over the many outs and the exit of the injured Scotsman Robert Archibald during the game.
Despite the many disadvantages for the Unicaja, a bit of hope was restored in the 31st minute, thanks to the lead and the triple by Cook and the effort of Lewis, 66-57.
However, it was impossible, because once the Olympiacos attacked and showed its superiority by centimeters within the basket, it was unstoppable.
In the 37th minute, Croatian captain Nikola Vujcic managed to increase the basket difference to 81-62 and Unicaja had to give up the lead to Olympiacos.
How much should you make based on your Facebook profile?
Facebook users can now find out their salary based on their profile, thanks to the new application Trovit, the search engine with the most ads for real estate, jobs and cars in Spain.
The tool "How much should you earn?" calculates the salaries of users based on more than 140,000 job offers that Trovit has in Spain, and users have a form on Facebook where they can enter their profession, work experience, age and the city where they work.
After just one week of the app's availability, the search engine found that the average Spanish worker "feels poorly paid", explains Trovit product manager Albert Ribera in a press release.
The Spanish are the worst paid, according to the data obtained by Trovit from its search engines in the UK and France.
A British programmer receives a gross annual salary of 45,226 euros and a Frenchman 31,059 euros, as opposed to the 24,000 euros earned by a Spaniard.
The average annual net salary of a lorry driver is thus €34,247 in England, €25,751 in France and €16,420 in Spain.
According to Trovit, the lowest-paid job in Spain is that of a waiter with €11,592 net per year, followed by that of a salesman with €14,725 and that of a laborer with €15,667.
The most searched jobs on the Internet in the last three months are drivers, part-time workers and social workers.
Brazil names Zelaya as date to leave
The Brazilian government has put a deadline on Manuel Zelaya's stay at its embassy in Tegucigalpa.
The President-elect must leave the diplomatic mission by 27 January 2010 at the latest, when his term of office formally expires.
Francisco Catunda, the trade delegate of the Brazilian embassy in the Honduran capital, confirmed to TV Globo that "Mel" knew that before that date he had to have left the embassy where he had found asylum since September 21.
'He is aware that he will have to leave on 27 January, as his mandate expires on that day and he must find a new place to live.'
The channel also quoted the ex-president, who confirmed his intention to leave the embassy before the scheduled date: "My position is to leave as soon as possible, logically with the backing of the government of Brazil", Zelaya explained on the phone.
After the November 29 elections (in which Porfirio Lobo emerged as the winner), Zelaya assured that he would remain in the Brazilian Embassy until January.
However, this week he sought asylum in Brazil.
This was frustrated by Zelaya's refusal to recognise the status of asylum-seeker politician that the de facto government headed by Roberto Micheletti wanted to impose on him.
Thank you very much.
After the most tempting days since last spring, when asset inflation was the prevailing sentiment in the markets, uncertainty has returned to the markets, which is not surprising, as this is their natural state in an environment where brokers are making decisions about an inherently uncertain future.
The measure adopted to stabilise markets was to settle the debt by buying assets directly and indirectly to free up liquidity at interest rates around zero, so that banks could buy assets for settlement.
The central banks have already confirmed that asset purchases are virtually over and, without questioning their heterodox liquidity policy, are starting to throw some sand into the water, as the ECB has already promised with its annual auction next week.
So investors are doubting the ability of the world economy to sustain economic recovery without these heterodox measures and we are now seeing a reversal in the reduction of risk premia.
The volatility of the stock market and the differences in corporate bonuses are rising again, although they are still far from the paranormal amounts they reached at the beginning of the year.
The States were forced to nationalise private risks and the public debt is again on the rise.
The focus is now back on quality, and the US, Japan and Germany are the preferred havens of investors, which in turn leads to an increase in the differences between the euro zone countries and Germany.
Spain has so far been hardly affected by this episode of instability, but then Standard & Poor's came along and threatened to downgrade Spain's rating again.
On the other hand, a certain amount of uncertainty is not bad for silencing the defenders of moral hazard who once again tried to make the world's economic policy-makers aware of what they had caused by slowing down the devastating effects of the credit limitation on job losses when they should have been setting a new day for thanksgiving.
Nevertheless, what happened in Dubai indicates a tribal war between the emirates to restore power in the emirates and the development in Greece was also foreseen earlier.
A government that doesn't disclose the national debt, elections and a new government that pulls the same string.
Prodi made it to Berlusconi in Italy and Socrates to Durão Barroso in Portugal.
It is not sensible that Ecofin should rescue Hungary from defaulting on its external payments at the beginning of the year and thus allow a euro-member country to default on its obligations.
It is logical, however, that Ecofin has forced the Greek government to be transparent and to involve its citizens in the need for extraordinary measures to maintain the stability of public funds.
The Commission's proposal to the Council for a regulation on the European Parliament's role in the European Community is a step in the right direction.
In the case of Spain, there is no need to worry as long as the government debt differentials increase at the same rate as the European corporate bonuses.
However, if European differences decrease and Spanish differences increase, this would constitute a specific Spanish risk.
The Standard & Poor's is a farce.While the advance of the indicators here forces a large number of market research institutes to advance their recovery scenarios and to adjust their scenario for 2011 upwards, including the OECD and the European Commission, which again come up with a Japanese scenario for the Spanish economy, all this does not promise longevity despite warnings.
Once again, it seems like a great opportunity to buy Spanish stocks, even though it's "be careful when you drive" at the moment.
Connected branches
The chairman of Iberdrola, Ignacio Sánchez Galán, was the first to appear yesterday before the Parliament's subcommittee, where the strategy for supplying Spain with energy over the next two decades is being debated these days.
After his speech, which was followed by the chairman of Gas Natural-Fenosa, Rafael Villaseca, Galán gave the press some hints about what he had presented to the subcommittee behind closed doors.
According to the chairman of Iberdrola, Spain must invest €50 billion by 2020 and €60 billion from that date until 2030, provided that the current nuclear power plants remain in operation.
If this were not the case, the investment required would not be 60 billion but up to 95 billion.
However, Iberdrola considers that the investment should no longer be in increasing the capacity of energy production, but in distribution networks and international alliances.
From 2020, the question will change and you should increase the performance.
His proposal focuses on both gas and coal plants with carbon dioxide capture facilities and, of course, on renewable energies in particular.
In this case, it assumes that 18,000 MW more will be needed, provided of course that other 'supporting' energies are used.
Galán, who believes that the bill for a sustainable economy that has just been adopted by the government is in line with what his company has demanded, did not want to say anything against this law, such as creating incentives for national coal consumption, which would be the exact opposite of all political strategies in the fight against climate change.
In his opinion, 'this is a clear long-term commitment, despite some'individual' measures, as the chairman of Iberdrola put it.
However, Galán believes that decisions on investments should be made now, even if they are long-term, as it will take some time and a stable remuneration framework must be created to tackle them.
Ferrovial gets the "handling" from Aer Lingus at ten airports
Ferrovial's ground-based airport services subsidiary, Swissport, is the preferred partner of the Irish airline Aer Lingus for baggage services at ten European airports where it is present.
Paris, London, Frankfurt and Brussels are some of the most important.
The agreement, for which no figures have yet been published, is for a period of five years.
On the other hand, Ferrovial, the Government of Castilla-La Mancha and the University of Alcalá de Henares signed a protocol of cooperation yesterday to create an innovation centre for intelligent infrastructures.
The Alliance plans to invest EUR 20 million by 2012, 50% of which will come from Ferrovial.
One of the tasks of the Centre will be to study energy efficiency on motorways and airports.
Acciona competes with Hochtief and Bouygues for its first highway in Australia
Acciona is fighting for the approval of its first motorway in Australia, a market in which it is already present as an energy and water company.
The project is a tunnel that will cost A$1.7 billion (about $1.9 billion).
The French company Bouygues and the German company Hochtief are its competitors.
A 5 km long tunnel in the eastern coastal city of Brisbane has become the best opportunity for Acciona to establish itself in the country as a construction company and highway operator.
The city wants to complete the construction by the end of 2014.
Having opted for a public-private partnership (PPP) to drive the project forward according to a business plan drawn up by Ernst & Young, the administration already has a final list of candidates for the construction and toll administration.
In anticipation of the bids presented in May, the estimated investment amounts to AUD 1.7 billion (EUR 1.047 billion), with three consortia competing in the final phase, mainly European construction companies.
The group called Transcity is headed by Acciona, the only Spanish company, and its partners are BMD and Ghella.
The first is one of Australia's largest construction companies, while the second, based in Italy, is one of the best specialists in deep-sea engineering.
Acciona's team is being challenged by the Northern Direct consortium, made up of the British company Laing O'Rourke, the Australian company Transfield, which is responsible for infrastructure, and the French construction group Bouygues.
The third and final consortium, which is in the narrowest group, is called LBRJV, formed by the capital of the Australian Leighton (subsidiary of the German construction company Hochtief, which in turn belongs to ACS), which is also local Baulderstone (owned by the German group Bilfinger Berger) and the French company Razel, which specialises in public construction.
The Australian infrastructure market promises massive construction and privatisation, but there is a hurdle to overcome, as the only way to gain access is to buy a local construction company.
A strategy followed by the companies Hochtief and Bilfinger, in addition to Asian references, and which has yet to be followed by the Spanish construction giants.
ACS itself has only entered this market through its 30% shareholding in Hochtief, which owns Leighton.
Million in assets
Acciona is based on this geographical area of major importance for the industry, where it is already well known for its activities as an energy supplier and in the desalination industry.
Among other assets, it already has its largest wind farm (192 MW) in Victoria and leads the group of companies tasked with building and managing the Adelaide desalination plant with a budget of 700 million.
Its intention is now to consolidate in these two areas and to use these synergies to gain access to the construction and infrastructure sectors.
The underground toll road, called the Northern Link, is being developed by the Brisbane Infrastructure Authority and will connect the Western Highway at Toowong with the bypass road at Kelvin Grove (see map) by a 5 km tunnel, the largest congestion reduction project on Brisbane's roads.
The timetable published by the city government provides for the awarding of the contract in summer 2010 and the start of the construction works in December next year.
The Commission notes that the Commission did not provide any information on the costs of the new toll road in the period from 1 January 2014 to 31 December 2016.
The tunnel was designed in 2005.
It has two lanes in each direction, an electronic tolling system and a complex ventilation system.
The Queensland Government is contributing A$500 million to the project.
Brisbane is a big deal for the high-end.
Australia is continuing to place substantial orders for Hochtief, which signed a contract with the government yesterday for 154 million.
The ACS sub-company will improve the infrastructure of the domestic broadband network with fibre cables through its domestic subsidiary Leighton.
This improvement will provide 400,000 people with high-speed Internet access and will keep the German company employed for 18 months.
On the other hand, the company has been awarded the 27-storey King George Tower in Brisbane, Australia, for which Hochtief has received 129 million dollars, but construction has not yet started.
In the United Kingdom, in Manchester, it is also competing with Laing O'Rourke for the construction and management of two schools over 25 years.
The initial investment is EUR 75 million.
FCC wins the contract for a tunnel in Slovenia for 64 million
FCC, through its subsidiary Alpine, has procured the construction of a 2.1 km long tunnel for a motorway in Slovenia for a sum of EUR 64.5 million.
The company received this contract only a few days after it had been awarded the contract for the construction of the Bosruck tunnel extension (Austria) for more than 130 million.
In this way Alpine is consolidating its experience in tunnel construction.
Construction is scheduled to begin in early 2010 and will take 32 months to complete.
Mrs. Rushmore receives publicity from Renfe
Renfe has allocated advertising and marketing services to Mrs Rushmore's agency for the next two years, for a sum of approximately EUR 3 million per year, the railway company said.
The contract also provides for two extensions of 12 months each. Mrs Rushmore was selected from 16 agencies which had submitted to this competition organised by Renfe, four of which had reached the final round, including TBWA, which had been responsible for advertising for the last three years.
From now on, Mrs. Rushmore will be in charge of designing and producing the campaigns.
The Commission has decided to impose a fine of 63 million francs on France Télécom for having restricted competition.
France Télécom has been fined by the French competition regulator for anti-competitive behaviour in its Caribbean territories.
According to the Authority, the telephone operator restricted competition in the fixed and mobile markets by signing exclusive contracts, pricing plans and loyalty programmes for consumers on the margins of regulation.
Together with this sanction, the former French monopoly and still state-owned company has accumulated more than EUR 560 million in fines since 1994 for impeding its competitors.
The penalty imposed yesterday was even increased because the competition authority believes that France Télécom has committed similar infringements in the past and has therefore fallen back.
Trade in services
On the other hand, the French company's subsidiary followed the example of other telephone providers and opened an application-trading site on the Internet to increase the revenue from business other than the telephone connection.
In principle, this Orange user site is active in France and the United Kingdom.
We have to wait until 2010 for this Siete to be available in other countries, such as Spain.
The Champions League match has brought Madrid and Barça 476.4 million since the start.
Since its inception in 1992, the Champions League has become a source of revenue for football clubs.
So much so that Real Madrid and Barcelona have since taken in $476.4 million, which puts them in third and fifth place, respectively, of the highest-earning football clubs in the league.
The leader of this list is Manchester United.
The leader of this list is Manchester United.
Winning the UEFA Champions League is not only glorious, it is also one of the main sources of income for the big clubs.
According to UEFA, the league has distributed up to €5,362.5 million to the 105 teams (including 12 Spanish teams) that have participated in the competition since its inception in the 1992/93 season.
Real Madrid and FC Barcelona benefited from this distribution.
The club is the third most successful in Europe in terms of earnings from participation and the only club besides AC Milan to have won the trophy three times.
The reigning Catalan champion and last winner of the former European Cup in 1992 is fifth.
The list is topped by Manchester United and Bayern Munich, two teams that also made the most money from their participation in the last Champions League.
And that's despite losing to Barça.
On the other hand, Spain is only third among the countries which have been able to win money through the Champions, although it has more titles than all the others (five, as opposed to four in Italy, three in England and two in Germany).
Distribution of the
This apparent contradiction is explained by the complicated funding procedure used by UEFA.
In the current financial year, the organisation, chaired by Michel Platini, expects to receive €1.090 million from the Champions League.
Of this money, UEFA has set aside 413.1 million for fixed payments: each of the 20 football clubs that took part in the qualifying round (including Atlético de Madrid) received 2.1 million.
In addition, those who claimed a place earned 3.8 million by attending, in addition to the 550,000 euros for each game they played.
There is also a bonus for winning (800,000 euros) and for a draw (400,000 per team).The clubs that made it to the round of 16 each receive three million; the four that made it to the quarterfinals, 3.3 million.
The last four will each get 4 million.
The winner will earn $9 million, as opposed to the runner-up, who will receive $5.2 million.
A football club receives a minimum of EUR 7.1 million and a maximum of EUR 31.2 million in fixed income.
Barça, on the other hand, earned 2.5 million for winning the European Super Cup in August.
However, this is in addition to the variable payments, for which 337.8 million is earmarked.
This money is allocated in proportion to the value of each television market.
The Spanish is one of the first and has 4 assigned places.
Last year's champion gets 40% of the money, 30% of the second, 20% of the third, 10% of the fourth.
The other half is distributed according to the number of games they play in this year's edition.
Nueva Rumasa offers 61 million for a 29.9% stake in Sos
The Nueva Rumasa Group leaked details of the share purchase offer yesterday, with which it intends to acquire a ceiling of between 25 and 29.9% of the capital of Sos.
A percentage which, by virtue of the number of shares, does not oblige them to make an open tender (OPA).
In concrete terms, Nueva Rumasa offers EUR 1.5025 per share, to be paid over ten years and at an interest rate of 1% per annum as a result of this deferral.
Yesterday, the shares of Sos closed at 1.85 euros, so Nueva Rumasa is valuing the company 18% below market.
According to Nuevan Rumasa, the price of EUR 1,50 reflects the real valuation of Sos.
The offer is linked to the appointment of eight of the 15 advisers.
The Jeréz Group gives the shareholders a period of 15 days to notify their interest in selling their shares.
CNMV stated that it had not been informed of this offer, although Ruiz Mateos confirmed that it had contacted the Authority.
The amount of the deposit would be 611.7 million when the transaction is completed, while the value of Sos is 254.27 million.
Meanwhile, Sos continues to restructure its business.
In an attempt to stay out of the way of potential bids and the legal battles of his former managers, brothers Jesús and Jaime Salazar have announced the appointment of María Luisa Jordá as head of internal audit.
A decision that will make her the first woman to hold a senior position in the food industry.
This is a newly created post which reports directly to the group chairman.
This is far from being a polemic issue, because the company is embroiled in a legal battle over alleged diversion of more than 230 million SOs to other Salazar family companies.
It cannot be excluded that Sos will move further capital in the coming months.
With regard to the Salazar loan, yesterday the former consultants Ildefonso Ortega and Ángel Fernández Noriega (representatives of the CCM and Unicaja) appeared before the National Assembly and confirmed that they had approved the transfer of 212 million without knowing its destination.
CNMV approves the public tender for Paternina submitted by the investment company Mer
The National Stock Exchange Commission (CNMV) approved the public tender for Federico Paternina, which had been submitted by the investment company Mer, on 9 October.
The supervisory authority stated that it approved the tender after it had demonstrated that the conditions were in accordance with the applicable laws and that the content of the explanatory memorandum submitted could be considered "sufficient" following the amendments of 2 December.
CNMV also informed that this offer was intended to acquire 550,008 shares of Federico Paternina at a price of EUR 7,65 per share, which is in turn 8,95% of the company capital, which consists of EUR 6,142,786 in shares admitted to the Madrid and Bilbao stock exchanges.
It was also announced that 5,592,778 million shares had been secured, which could not be transferred until the tender was closed and the price of which had been fixed by Federico Paternina in accordance with the laws in force.
New programmes for the inspection of vehicles
In these days of storms and accidents, not only the car repair shops earn
Every day, thousands of vehicles involved in an accident are hauled to the workshops where an appraiser must assess the damage and the cost of repairs.
No two accidents are alike and calculating the cost of parts and man hours can be a long and complicated task.
The calculation of the repair costs, which are between EUR 20 000 and EUR 30 000 per person, including parts and hours of work, can take up to two or three hours.
In contrast, with the help of the latest computer tools, it is a matter of minutes
This is why almost 100% of the appraisers use this type of system.
Accident and repair assessment and application service providers collect the information they receive from manufacturers, process it and provide it to their customers in the form of a useful program.
In Spain, Audatex, part of the American Solera group, is the market leader; 80% of all assessments are produced with its products.
The other two companies competing in the market for assessment and reporting tools are GtMotive and Eurotax.
Working with the data supplied by the manufacturers is anything but easy.
According to Eduardo Velázquez, Sales Manager of Audatex, 63 manufacturers and importers are working together, each of them providing the information in a different format.
In addition, the amount of data to be processed is increasing, to the point that in the last five years more versions, variants and engines have been launched than in the whole of the previous fifteen years.
As soon as a new car is on the market, work begins for the companies.
It is a difficult task, because every one of the thousand vehicle parts has to be catalogued and its price entered.
In addition, each model creates an "intelligent" graphic image on which different parts of the vehicle can be "clicked".
If the model is a big seller, the work can be completed in a week if the process proceeds quickly.
The Commission has also been asked to draw up a list of the most important products which are likely to be sold in the future, and to draw up a list of the most important products which are likely to be sold in the future.
Among the more exclusive models, they have information on the Porsche models, for example, but not on the Ferrari or Lamborghini.
In terms of the number of vehicles on the road, it is over 99%.
Audatex has eight centres worldwide (Spain, France, Germany, USA, Brazil, Mexico, China and Japan) for the purpose of carrying out the documentation and compiling the databases, each of which is specialised in certain brands.
The national headquarters are in Alcobendas (Madrid).
More than a hundred technicians (usually mechanics) work simultaneously on three computer screens.
Audatex invests 90 million euro annually in the development of these databases.
They're taking in 2.5 million pieces of data every month, and their customers are getting updates every other day.
The development of this enormous flow of information enables companies to use it in different ways and thus offer different products.
The most common use is for repairs and maintenance, but depending on the country, there are also tools for managing scrap parts or calculating the fair or residual value of a car.
The only company that has a guide that informs about the value of used cars in Spain is Eurotax.
Audatex does not offer this service in Spain, but does in the United States.
By reviewing the products offered by Audatex, it is easy to get an overview of the kind of support it provides to the industry experts.
This company offers ten different tools, the star of which is AudaPlus, a standard accident detection solution for appraisers.
It includes vehicles, motorcycles and light and heavy industrial vehicles.
In addition to the cost of the parts, it includes the repair times or painting prices estimated by the manufacturer.
This tool is paid for by purpose, i.e. for each expertise.
The most expensive will be for customers who use it rarely, up to ten times a month, namely 5.75 euros per month.
In contrast, every insurance company that produces thousands of reviews negotiates the price with Audatex.
With other products, such as AudaVIN, a vehicle and the equipment it was fitted with can be fully identified by the chassis number alone.
AudaGlass is concerned with vehicle windows and AudaSubastas is an Internet service open to the specialist market, which can be used for vehicles that have been declared totally damaged.
Their statistical service is very useful for identifying trends, carrying out geodemographic analyses or obtaining information on variations by make and model.
For example, it can be used to determine how many models of a particular car have had to be repaired due to breakdowns or how many of them have been involved in a serious accident during a given period of time.
Gt Motive is the only Spanish company dedicated to the development of this type of computer tool.
It distributes, among other things, Gt Estimate, which is also intended for appraisers and provides digital images, access to parts or prices and official hours of the manufacturer.
Gt Motive is a company of the Einsa Group, which was founded in 1971 as a provider of services and solutions for the assessment of damage, breakdowns and maintenance of vehicles.
The GT Guide for Expertise is a reference product on the market.
They work with 24,000 users in workshops, 3,100 appraisers and 53 insurance companies.
Its business volume has increased by 20% per annum over the last three years, with a turnover of EUR 10.8 million in 2008.
At the beginning of last year, they started to go international with the opening of an office in Paris.
Audatex, on the other hand, was founded in Germany in 1966 and established in Spain in 1979.
According to the company's sources, 62% of its business is in Europe and the rest of the world, and the remaining 38% in the Americas, working with 900 insurance companies and 33,000 workshops, 3,000 of them in Spain.
The total worldwide turnover of the Solera Group (Audatex, Sidexa, Informex ABZ, Hollander and IMS) is $557 million, 3.35 more than in 2008.
In this country, the company's revenue was 19.1 million euros, 7.2% more than in the previous year.
In 2005, the Solera Group was worth $1 billion on the stock market, and today its shares are worth $2.4 billion.
Since 2007, they have been listed on the New York Stock Exchange and are part of the Standard & Poor's index.
Auctioning of end-of-life vehicles on the Internet
Last October, the Solera Autoonline group bought an online platform for the sale of emergency vehicles and motorcycles.
This purchase involved the payment of EUR 59.5 million for 85% of the company's capital, which could increase to the remaining 15% next year.
The purpose of this purchase was to offer its customers more services and value, with the possibility of gaining access to a huge international market.
This appraisal and purchase service is exclusively for professionals in the sector, such as insurance companies, appraisers, car rental companies, workshops, scrap yards and car dealers, who must register before their activities.
This platform was founded in Germany in 1996 and manages more than 650,000 transactions across Europe, 500,000 of which are in Germany alone.
Its main markets are Spain, Greece, Poland and Turkey.
The site now has over 1,500 registered sellers and 4,000 reviewers.
It manages 3,000 ads per day and adds 100 new ads every day in the Spanish market.
According to Spanish legislation, a vehicle whose registration number has been withdrawn may no longer be driven on the road, but certain undamaged parts may be used as spare parts.
Historic cars, on the other hand, can be re-registered even if they have been deregistered after difficult government procedures.
The workshop's four-step cost estimate
With the Auda-Taller tool, Audatex ensures that the user receives a cost estimate in just four steps:identification of the vehicle, finding the spare part, preparation and preparation of a cost estimate.
The ease of use of these systems is a fundamental requirement, especially in order to convince the older professionals, who are usually more or less against the use of these new computer technologies.
The database contains 1,034 vehicles, 666 of which are motor vehicles, 109 off-road vehicles, 137 motorcycles, 78 vans and 44 trucks.
Of course, you need a computer with an Internet connection to use it.
After the model to be repaired has been identified by means of the chassis number, a graphic of the model appears and the required spare part is selected.
The user can include variables such as the price for hours worked, surcharges or discounts and then print out the cost estimate and pass it on to his customers.
However, AudaTaller is not a tool for evaluation like AudaPlus, but rather a reference catalogue.
The main difference between the two systems is that the one targeting the workshop does not include estimated working hours.
The cost of using this tool is 350 euros a year, an amount which the customer can pay for himself.
The company Audatex is currently working on the possibility of offering these images in three-dimensional format.
This is an innovation that car mechanics have been waiting for a long time, because it allows them to select a door, for example, and then to turn the image completely around to look at the inside.
