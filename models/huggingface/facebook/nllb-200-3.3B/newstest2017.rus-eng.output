28-year-old chef found dead in a San Francisco mall.
A 28-year-old chef who recently moved to San Francisco was found dead in the stairwell of a local mall this week.
However, the victim's brother says that he cannot imagine anyone wanting to hurt him, noting: "He was finally getting his way".
The body found at Westfield Mall on Wednesday morning has been identified as San Francisco resident Frank Galicia, 28, the San Francisco Medical Examiner's office said.
The San Francisco Police Department reports that the death has been classified as a homicide and the investigation is ongoing.
The victim's brother, Luis Galicia, told ABC's KGO in San Francisco that Frank, a former Boston food-line cook, got his dream job as a chef at San Francisco's Sons & Daughters six months ago.
A spokesman for Sons & Daughters said they were "shocked and devastated" by his death.
"We are a small team that works like a close-knit family and he will be sorely missed", said the spokesperson.
Our thoughts and condolences are with Frank's family and friends during this difficult time.
Luis Galicia said that Frank had initially stayed in hostels, but lately "he was finally getting things going".
"He found an apartment, he was dating a girl", Luis Galicia told KGO.
Luis Galicia said he couldn't imagine anyone wanting to hurt his younger brother.
He had a good soul and a big heart.
His way of communicating with the family was always to prepare a meal for us, to prepare dinner for us", said Luis Galicia.
He never wanted to be involved in any kind of fight.
He was a brother who went with the flow.
"With all the bad things that are happening in this world, he was that uncut diamond that shone brightly every day", he said.

Italy's public debt was over 2,248 trillion euros as of June 2016.
The country's central bank said that this amount is a historic maximum, RIA Novosti reports.
The previous record was set in May of this year.
The national debt was 2.228 trillion euros.
It is noted that in the first half of the year, Italy's debt burden increased by 77.2 billion euros.
Earlier, it was reported that Italy's public debt stood at 132.7% of the country's GDP at the end of 2015.

141 people received charitable payments from the "Aviation" fund, which was created by the management of the Domodedovo airport to help victims of the terrorist attack in 2011, Interfax reports.
According to the airport's press secretary, Alexander Vlasov, there are two more applications under consideration.
"The fund continues to provide charitable payments to victims of the 2011 terrorist attack and provides comprehensive assistance in resolving existing issues", Vlasov added, recalling that the website of the fund was created specifically to facilitate interaction with the victims, containing full information about the procedure for providing charitable assistance.

The attack killed 37 people and injured 172 others.
Scientists have found an animal that can live for 500 years
An international team of biologists has concluded that the longest-lived vertebrate is the Greenland shark, which can live for about 500 years, reports RT.
Scientists have performed radiocarbon analysis of the crystals in the eyes of 28 Greenland sharks.
The largest shark, measuring more than five meters (16 feet) in length, may be between 272 and 512 years old.
Biologists believe that a shark's low metabolism, which leads to a slow development, is a major factor in its longevity.
Female Greenland sharks only reach sexual maturity at about 150 years of age.
The longest-lived vertebrate was previously thought to be its "neighbor", the Greenland whale.
The oldest known individual was a little over 210 years old.
Putin changed the composition of the Security Council of the Russian Federation.
Russian President Vladimir Putin has amended the composition of the Russian Security Council, the Kremlin press service reported.
Earlier it was reported that Putin removed from office the head of the presidential administration, Sergei Ivanov, his successor was appointed Anton Vaino.
Ivanov will now work as a special representative of the president on environmental protection, ecology and transport.
Deputy Secretary Rashid Nurgaliyev was expelled from the permanent members of the Security Council of the Russian Federation.
The council includes Sergey Ivanov, Anton Vaino, the deputy of the president in the SFOR Sergey Menyai and deputy in the SFOR Nikolai Tsukanov.
Sergei Ivanov is relieved of his duties as head of the presidential administration.
By presidential decree, Sergei Ivanov was relieved of his post as head of the Kremlin administration.
Ivanov was appointed special representative of the Russian Federation for nature protection, ecology and transport.
Anton Vaino, who had previously held the post of Sergei Ivanov's deputy, was appointed as the new head of the administration.
According to Vladimir Putin, Ivanov himself asked him to transfer him to another job.
Is it worth going to a sanatorium if you have no health problems?
Our expert is the head doctor of the sanatorium Olga Bogush.
If a person is healthy, just tired from work, should he go to a sanatorium?
We need to go to the spa not only to cure but also to prevent illness.
In a sanatorium, a person can check the condition of his body and receive a doctor's recommendations on how to live so that his health is not destroyed.
Such recommendations will be helpful to all.
"Just tired from work" is an important sign from the body that should not be ignored.
Constant stress, mental and physical overwork can lead to depression and chronic fatigue syndrome.
And about 90% of the people who come here are stressed.
And the most vulnerable are people in big cities between the ages of 45 and 55.
So it's best to keep it simple and give yourself a break.
Studies show that 98% of people shorten their biological age during their stay in a sanatorium.
Modern sanatoriums offer a comfortable vacation for the whole family.
So if you want to spend your vacation with the kids, you don't have to leave them behind.
Even for very young children, there are wellness programs that include diagnostic services, pediatric consultations, tests, and treatment.
For example, swimming (many of the sanatoriums have children's pools), inhalation, special diet, massages, oxygen cocktails, therapeutic exercise.
The doctor determines the course of treatment according to the individual's indications and the characteristics of the growing organism.
In addition, there is usually a children's club with animators in the sanatoriums, where children can attend games and various workshops.
Some nursing homes even open their doors to guests with infants, provide the necessary facilities for infants, and offer experienced nanny services.
The mild winter, long summer, and abundance of sunny days in the year (over 300) create good conditions for year-round recreation in the resorts of the Caucasian Mineral Waters.
And then the body needs rest not only in the summer.
So you don't have to worry about the weather outside, especially since most of the procedures are done indoors and are completely out of season.
In general, it is desirable to have a spa treatment twice a year, especially for older people.
The main feature of the Caucasus Mineral Waters region, of course, is the healing mineral springs: Slavyansk, Smirnov, Yesentuki, Narzan.
Their waters have unique properties and affect different systems in the body.
Water varies in temperature, amount of salts, overall mineralization, chemical and gas composition.
The doctor selects the water based on the patient's condition.
Narzan has anti-inflammatory, immunomodulating effects, and restores the function of the gastrointestinal tract and metabolism.
Essentucky-4 affects the gastrointestinal tract, lowers the sugar level.
Essentially, it has anti-inflammatory, bile- and urine-suppressing properties.
The same effects are also possessed by the water "Slavianovskaya".
When prescribing water, the doctor must take into account the state of the cardiovascular system.
If he's hypertensive, he'll choose less salty water because the salts are holding the fluid, which raises the blood pressure.
Drinking mineral water requires regularity: the water should be consumed at a certain time, in the right amount, and at a specific temperature.
Today, health centers offer a variety of facial and body cosmetic treatments.
What types of healing based on the natural features of the North Caucasus can be found in the resorts of this region?
Near Pyatigorsk, for example, there is a salt lake Tambukan, the silt from which is useful for the joints, spine, internal organs.
It has anti-inflammatory, anti-absorbing, immuno-modulating effects.
It's a wellness walk on a customized itinerary.
They are especially popular in Kislovodsk, where there is a huge Resort Park (the second largest in Europe).
Popular in Kislovodsk, which is located in the immediate vicinity of the mineral source "Narzan".
You can also take a wine, pearl, iodine, selenium, or sage-water bath, depending on what your doctor recommends.
We'll extend the gestation.
What can we do to make sure the harvest lasts until the end of the season?
As told by Yulia Belopukhova, an agronomist and a dacher.
The new buds, the buds, the leaves, the last to the last, the fruit and the flowers with the small knots, all have to be cut off before they ripen.
All tomatoes, regardless of the "constitution", as well as peppers and eggplants are fed by a sulphur-superphosphate extract, treated with biopreparates (Dozrevaletel - to accelerate the infusion and growth of fruits, Phytosporin-M, Phytolavin, Gamair, Bactophyt - from diseases, Immunocytophytite - to increase immunity, Bitoxibacilin, Lepidocide, Fitover - if there are pests).
Of the chemicals, only copper sulfur, colloidal sulfur and green soap should be used in late summer.
We're doing the last of the planting.
Long-leaf cucumbers in the greenhouse are lowered from the wall so that the lower, bare part of the stem (25-40 cm) lies on the ground, pour warm water and a solution of Zircon, pour 5-7 cm of compost on the stem.
Prolonging the fruiting process is also easy: cut off old leaves, sprinkle warm water and a solution of complex fertilizers, and put fertile soil under the bush.
To protect the bed from the night cold, place a rainbow over the bed with a protective material.
Keep the plants open during the day and close them after sunset.
The signs of the end.
What indicates that Russia is emerging from the crisis?
Economists saw signs of Russia emerging from the longest recession in 20 years.
According to analysts polled by Bloomberg, Russia's GDP is showing positive dynamics - in the second quarter, GDP fell by 0.8% in annual terms.
This is the lowest level since the beginning of 2015.
According to the latest data from Rosstat, the Russian economy slowed to 0.6% in the second quarter.
The Central Bank and the Ministry of Economic Development have also recently stated that the situation has stabilized.
Slow growth in front.
According to the experts of the Central Bureau of Investigation, the recession in the Russian economy is in the past.
"The Russian GDP index indicates that the recession is behind us and that we are facing a slow growth", says the Bank of Russia's newsletter "What the trends say".
The modular estimate of GDP for the current quarter has been increased to 0.4% by the regulator's experts, and the estimate for the fourth quarter is 0.5%.
As the representative of the Ministry of Economic Development reported, during the second quarter, the decline in the GDP of the Russian Federation stopped in the second quarter, amounting to 0.2%.
In the second quarter, the seasonally adjusted GDP decline was 0.2% compared to the previous quarter.
But during the quarter, the decline stopped: in April it amounted to 0.2%, and in May and June, the change in GDP was within 0-0.15", - quotes the representative of the Ministry of Economy of RIA "Novosti".
The slowdown in the Russian economy over the past five quarters suggests that the bottom has been passed.
Among other markers pointing to signs of a national economic recovery, Bloomberg calls the growth in demand for electricity and rail transportation a business revival.
If we correct for the fact that the year is leap year, it is clear that the dynamics of plus 1% of electricity consumption can be half due to the additional working day.
Add to that the lower annual average temperature in the first quarter.
The next argument is the growth of cargo transportation, but it is difficult to obtain accurate data here, and plus or minus 0.5% of the half-yearly volume can also be explained by seasonality", explains Kirill Yakovenko from ALOR BROKER.
However, there are other, more obvious signs of stabilization in the Russian economy.
For example, lowering the price pressure.
In July, the consumer price index was 7.2% compared to 15.6% in the same month last year.
Moreover, for the last two weeks Rosstat has been recording deflation.
Prices in Russia have fallen for the first time in five years.
If you look at the dynamics of the ruble, which, although it showed strong fluctuations at the beginning of the year, by the end of August it has strengthened by 12% since the beginning of the year.
This is also one of the signs of recovery, which should be followed by indicators from the real sector of the economy", emphasizes Yakovenko.
In addition, since April, Russia has seen an increase in industrial production.
In June, it was up 1.7%.
The rate of falling foreign trade turnover from -32.8% in January 2016 to -20.7% in May is slowing down.
The situation on the labour market also shows a positive trend, with the unemployment rate falling to 5.4%.
It was lower only in September 2015 (5.2%).
Despite the prosperous labour market situation, the real disposable income of the population is still a matter of hope.
The annual rate is down 4.8 percent.
This can hamper economic recovery, as household spending contributes significantly to GDP.
They typically account for more than 50 percent of the economy.
In addition to low consumer activity, the Bank of Russia's tough policy can also be called as a risk factor for economic growth.
The regulator is keeping the rate at 10.5%, which is not good for the real sector.
The negative factor is the insufficient level of investment, which holds back the development of industrial potential.
But in general, we can assume that by the end of the year the rate of decline of the Russian economy will slow down to -0.5% against -3.7% in 2015", says analyst GC Forex Club Irina Rogova.
The process of naturalization of athletes, recently launched in Russian football and perfectly established in winter sports at the Olympics in Sochi, has not yet been so actively developed in summer sports.
If former foreigners are representing Russia at the Rio Olympics, it is mostly natives of former Soviet republics.
In Rio de Janeiro, however, we can see the opposite process - quite a large number of Russians perform under the flags of other countries.
The history of changing citizenship is different in each case.
Some parents were taken to another country as children, leaving them no choice.
Someone couldn't compete for a spot on the Russian national team.
And some people thought that abroad would create better conditions for the development of sports.
AIF.ru found at least 16 athletes who have decided to change their Russian citizenship.
The German passport of a 27-year-old girl says her name is Lisa Red.
But before that, of course, she was Elizabeth.
She was born in 1988 in the city of Omsk.
Just four years later, as soon as the Soviet Union collapsed, Lisa's parents decided to emigrate to Germany.
The girl had no choice.
There, she decided to follow in her older sister's footsteps - taking up track and field.
Like her sister, Lisa chose to jump with a pole.
If she had stayed in Russia, she would hardly have been able to "throw down" Yelena Isinbayeva.
Unfortunately, at the Rio Olympics, Lisa will be the only Earth girl, albeit an ex-Earth girl, in the pole vaulting section.
Her best achievements in this sport are the bronze medal at the 2010 European Championships and the silver medal at the 2016 Continental Championships, which she won again in the absence of Elena Isinbayeva.
29-year-old Elena Pirojkova was born in Novokuznetsk in 1986.
Her parents are evangelical religious propagandists.
Their faith was a big part of why they moved to the United States when she was only three years old.
In addition to Elena, eight other children were raised in the family.
They all lived in the small town of Greenfield, Massachusetts.
Lena started wrestling in high school.
Showing good results, she moved to Colorado Springs, where she continued her training at the United States Wrestling Training Center under the guidance of another former Russian, Vladislav Izboynikov.
At the 2012 London Olympics, she lost her first bout.
But at the World Championships that year, the victory.
Before that, she had won silver at the 2010 world championships.
After that, there was bronze in 2013 and silver in 2014.
26-year-old Maria was born in Yaroslavl, where she first became acquainted with synchronous swimming.
But to say that she was raised by our coaches in Russia would be wrong.
Soon the girl's family decided to emigrate to the United States and settle in the city of Colorado.
There, Maria continued her studies.
She soon became a member of the U.S. national team and performed well at the Pan American Games.
It's clear that at a serious international level, Russian timekeepers can't compete, but for America, its performance is ceiling.
The new name, which sounds strange in Russian, was given to Christina Shaldibina at the age of 11, when her parents decided to continue her artistic gymnastics training overseas.
Until that moment, the girl was engaged in her favorite sport in her native Yaroslavl.
After emigrating to the United States, she quickly made the U.S. youth national team and later broke into the senior national team.
At the Pan American Games, 19-year-old Kristen won gold and silver.
She didn't have to fight for the top spot on the world stage, but she did have a real breakthrough for the United States, leading the all-star team to the Rio Olympics.
Another former "artist" is Jana Berezko-Marggrander, who plays for the German national team.
Jana was born in Tolyatti.
In 2008, when she was 13, the family decided to move to Germany, where she had better prospects of making the national team.
She soon represented her country at the 2012 Olympic Games in London.
There, it is true, Yana was able to take only 17th place, not enough to reach the final competition in the individual competition.
But two years earlier, she had won the bronze medal at the Youth Olympic Games.
Another gymnast, but this time sporty - Irina Sazonova.
If the emigration routes of the aforementioned athletes can be called standard, then Irina's family's choice is very unusual - Iceland.
Ira is a student of the Volgograd sports school.
Naturally, in Iceland, she immediately became the national champion.
True, Ira is still training in Russia - he comes to his homeland specifically so as not to lose his skills.
In Rio, she didn't perform as well as she would have liked.
Best finish is 40th in the individual all-around.
There is very little information about swimming of Maria Ugalkova in the Russian information space.
For a very long time, Maria has been living and training in Switzerland.
However, for a long time she performed under the Russian flag, showing good results - there was even a country record in the 200 meter distance by batterfly.
In 2015, she received Swiss citizenship and began performing under the red and white flag.
In Rio, her best performance was 14th place in the 4×100 medley relay.
To get into the games, the girl launched a crowdfunding project, thanks to which she was able to raise about 6 thousand francs, which allowed her to pay for preparation for the Olympics.
The 31-year-old freestyle wrestler Adam Batirov spent almost his entire career under the Russian flag.
During this time, the native of Hasavyuurt managed to become a three-time champion of the European championships, the champion of Russia, the master of sports of Russia of international class.
When he stopped making our national team, it was time to think about changing his nationality.
For several years, the talented wrestler disappeared from the sports scene.
Batirov made a triumphant return to the 2016 Asian Championships, representing Bahrain, for whom he won a gold medal and a ticket to the Rio Olympics.
Another ex-Russian, Mikhail Kudinov, is even less known in his homeland than the Swiss swimmer Maria Ugolkov.
The fact is that his parents emigrated from Vladivostok to New Zealand when he was very young.
It was there that Mikhail began to practice gymnastics.
He has not had much international success.
In Rio, his best result was 40th place in the parallel bars qualifiers.
But for New Zealand, even getting into the Olympics in gymnastics is a breakthrough.
Born in Moscow in 1985, when she was just nine years old, her family emigrated to Israel.
There, she continued her synchronized swimming training, showing high results at the national level.
In 2014, at the European Championships in Berlin, she took 6th place in synchronous swimming.
In the duet with Eugenia Tettelbaum, Anastasia took the eighth place.
She was fifth in the solo program.
Like Anastasia, 23-year-old Dmitry Kreuter is a member of the Israeli national team.
When the boy was only six years old, his mother decided to repatriate to Israel.
In 2009, at the age of 17, Dmitry became the country's champion.
In the same year, he won the World Junior Championship.
A year later, Croiter won gold at the Youth Olympic Games in Singapore.
In addition to high jump, Dmitry is engaged in long jump and triple jump.
Albert, 31, is another Hassawuert native who, after a long stint with Russia, decided to change his sports citizenship.
However, unlike Batirov, Albert chose Romania, which he will represent in Rio.
In Russia, he played for the School of Higher Sports Mastery of Krasnoyarsk, in 2011 he even became the country's champion.
28-year-old Oleg Antonov was born in Moscow in the family of the USSR national volleyball team player Yaroslav Antonov.
Just a year before the birth of his son, Yaroslav was recognized as the best volleyball player on the planet.
He soon decided to continue his career in Italy.
The family settled there permanently.
In 2015, he became a bronze medalist of the European Championship held in his new homeland.
Born in Chechnya in 1994, Hajiyev and his family were caught in the midst of the war.
Ten years later, the parents decided to emigrate.
The original goal was Norway, but it was not possible to get to this northern country - we had to go to France, to Nice.
There, Zelimhan continued to train in wrestling.
Soon he won the world junior championship, and later qualified for the Olympic Games.
In Rio, he will be the only French representative in the wrestling tournament.
Free wrestling again, and again, ex-Russian.
This time it's about a North Ossetian who emigrated to Spain, Taimuraz Frieva.
In late December 2012, he was granted Spanish citizenship, and currently plays for the national team of this country.
Before that, though, the 30-year-old athlete had already achieved high results in Russia.
He won bronze medals at the 2007 and 2008 national championships.
Tired of not being selected for the national team, Taimuraz decided to change his sports citizenship.
The last on our list is a Chechen boxer, born in 1995 in the capital of Dagestan, Makhachkala, - Artur Byarslanov.
When the boy was ten years old, his parents took the family across Azerbaijan to Canada.
There, on the advice of his older brother, Arthur took up boxing.
Since then, Arthur has become a three-time Canadian champion and in 2012 a junior world champion.
In 2015, Byarslanov won gold at the Pan American Games, the first for his new home country since 1975.

Why do children have Cossack classes in schools?
According to Governor V. Kondratyev, "the order should be educated not by actions and parades, but systematically".
They must grow up and understand at least from the age of seven that they are Cossacks and education should be Cossack.
But so far, this work, as I think, is carried out formally and, I suspect, more on paper.
If the Cossack classes can absorb all the positive things that they have accumulated in the past, I'll be glad to see them at a qualitatively new level.
If you're all in a hurry, somehow, the new idea turns out to be cheap populism.
Housing continues to be one of the most criminal sectors of the economy.
The budget for the public utilities sector is being misappropriated at various levels.
According to the Attorney General's Office, overcharging is one of the most common crimes in the housing and utilities sector.
As a result, consumers in the region overpaid the power companies more than 170 million rubles.
The prosecutor's office of Krasnodar Territory has recently identified the inclusion of unjustified costs in the tariffs.
And in the expenses of "IV-consulting" LLC (provides cold water) 4 million rubles were put for renting cars at a price above the market price.
There are plenty of examples of that in the country.
The people pay for "communal" the last money, and pay correctly, - according to the Ministry of Construction of the Russian Federation, the average collection of payments from the population is 94%.
He is charged with several articles of the Criminal Code: embezzlement, legalization of income obtained by criminal means, abuse of power, etc.
According to the investigation, as the head of the foundation, which was engaged in the repair of city objects, Makarov concluded contracts with entrepreneurs, the work on them was not actually performed, but was paid for.
The businessmen just gave him back most of the money.
As the owner of the UK, Makarov collected money from the population, but did not pay the service providers and spent it on his own needs.
The result is millions of rubles in damage to the budget and the residents.
The scheme of Makarov's machinations, alas, is typical for Russia.
There was a wave of arrests and detentions of the leaders of the criminal justice system, who were appropriating money from citizens.
In Kamchatka, the trial of A. Kohan, by the way, also a former city council deputy, who is accused of fraud for 91.7 million rubles, continues.
According to the investigation, in 2012-2013, in Elizov, Kamchatka region, he founded 6 management companies and created 3 limited liability companies.
One of them performed contract work for the UC, two others played the role of cash-settlement centers, that is, accepted money from the population.
However, A. Kochan did not transfer funds to the energy sector, but spent on himself, his beloved.
It's hard to sue in the housing industry.
Things don't get exciting, they get dragged out.
And "help" in this extremely complicated housing legislation, - believes Svetlana Razvrotneva, executive director of the NP "Housing Control".
We don't have time to make one law work, as we invent a new one that should make the previous one work.
There are also not enough specialists, including among judges, on housing and communal services.
Lawyers themselves admit that housing law is given very little attention in universities.
The refusal to open criminal cases, the delay in the investigation, is also mentioned in the Prosecutor General's Office.
Of the 3,500 cases that were pending in 2015, less than half were prosecuted.
The rest of the investigation has taken a protracted nature, and every fifth is suspended due to the failure to establish the accused person.
Often, shortcomings in the activities of law enforcement agencies are attributed to gaps in the existing legislation.
There is a law, but the investigating authorities are in no hurry to initiate and investigate such cases.
In the second half of 2015, there were about 230 reports of counterfeiting - a total of 60 criminal cases.
In the first five months of this year, the number has increased only slightly, at 99.
What's a forgery of tenant meeting minutes?
That means that the change in management, finances, and other matters are not considered by the owners.
It also means that the housing market cannot be penetrated by normal companies that want to work honestly and not "milk" the population.
So, the residents are down, the small and medium businesses are down.
First of all, by eradicating corruption as such throughout the state, - said Anton Jarkov, a member of the State Duma Committee on Property.
And now this work is actively being done.
It's not just a one-off, it's a targeted course to fight corruption.
Of course, not all regions are as sad as this.
Especially in the capital, where there's no scandal.
Why is there no such scandal in Moscow in the field of housing, as in many other regions?
Yes, because the capital government showed an iron will and established order, - said "AIF" Anatoly Electoral, member of the State Duma Committee on security and anti-corruption.
I mean the personnel issue, the legislative amendments, the legal education.
The management companies are closely supervised, and they've all been licensed.
Complaints of citizens are quickly resolved in the public space (both the appeals of residents and the response measures are posted on the portal of the Moscow government).
Many not only pay their monthly receipts but also pay close attention to what is written on the receipts, how the house is maintained.
The awareness of the public about the rights of owners and the responsibilities of resource-providing and managing organisations is very high.
Plus Moscow is checking the justification of tariffs for housing and utilities - after all, a considerable part of budget funds goes to subsidies and benefits for many categories of the population.
I guess all of this together explains the calm in Moscow.
So, it's all up to the regional authorities?
Maybe the reluctant ones should change jobs?
The Turkish Gambit.
Can Erdogan give up his friendship with the EU and the US?
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has issued an ultimatum to the United States, offering a choice between Turkey and Fethullah Gulen, the Islamic preacher accused of plotting a coup.
He said this in a speech to his supporters in Ankara.
Erdogan called on Americans to stop supporting the "Fethullahist terrorist organization".
This is not the first time that Turkey has issued a statement calling for the US to change its position.
Experts believe that the rift in Turkey's relations with the West is growing and could lead to a new attempt to change the country's government.
"Sooner or later America will have to choose between Turkey and FETO (Fethullahist Terrorist Organization).
It's either FETO or democratic Turkey.
She must make this choice", Anatolian Agency quotes Erdogan's appeal, which was made on Wednesday evening in Ankara.
The Turkish president has demanded once again, and more forcefully, that the United States meet his demand, which he has made for the first time since the suppression of the rebellion.
We remind that on the night of July 16 in Turkey, high-ranking representatives of the Turkish army attempted to overthrow the legitimate government in the country, as well as attempted to kill the head of state.
However, after Recep Tayyip Erdogan made an appeal to the population, the revolt was put down and its organizers and participants were arrested.
In all, about 8,000 people were suspected, including teachers and scientists, in addition to the military.
According to Recep Tayyip Erdogan, their mentor was Fethullah Gülen, who lives in Pennsylvania in the United States.
Erdogan's supporters also admitted that the Americans themselves could be involved in the coup.
The US denied all claims against it, refusing to extradite Gülen and advising it to change its tone.
The latest statement from the State Department came during Erdogan's visit to St. Petersburg last Tuesday.
But that doesn't stop the Turkish president from insisting on his own and making demands on other Western partners.
"Ankara will stop fulfilling its obligations under the migration agreement with the European Union if Brussels does not announce the date of the lifting of visa restrictions for Turkish citizens", said Turkish EU Affairs Minister Omer Çelik on August 9.
He said Ankara's amendment of the anti-terrorism law, as demanded by the EU, would endanger Europe's own security.
On August 1, German Vice Chancellor Sigmar Gabriel demanded that Turkey stop blackmailing the European Union with promises to open its borders to migrants in order to ease visa requirements with the EU.
His words were in response to the statement of the Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu.
Another provocative statement was made by Cavusoglu last Wednesday, when he suggested that Turkey could withdraw from NATO.
The Turkish foreign minister did not rule out that the country would consider withdrawing from the alliance if it did not receive the support it expected.
The decision to increase defense cooperation with Russia is not a move against NATO.
There are NATO countries that are cooperating with foreign states in the defense sphere, - they import missiles", Cavusoglu said in an interview with Anadolu Agency.
Turkey now needs to create its own defense system based on its technologies, as well as cooperate with other countries, he said.
"Turkey has tried to cooperate with NATO member states, but we are not satisfied with the results and we have started looking for others", the minister said.
Experts believe that all this indicates Turkey's serious differences with the West and the reorientation of the country towards the East.
The head of the International Institute of Political Analysis, Yevgeny Minchenko, believes that Recep Erdogan is playing his game now and cannot go for a tough confrontation with the West.
He has a lot of ties to the West both from a business and a military point of view (Turkey is a member of NATO), so I think Erdogan will try to balance this by maintaining a framework relationship with the West.
Although, of course, the Americans would be more comfortable to see a completely obedient person in this post", the expert explained to AIF.ru.
According to him, it is possible that after the statements of the Turkish leader (about non-payment of EU compensations, about the demand for a visa-free space with Europe and the extradition of Gülen from the USA) he will be pressured.
"Recep Erdogan will face a deterioration in relations with both America and the European Union, and they will press him precisely on humanitarian issues, dictatorial methods of running the country and so on", Minchenko believes.
The head of the Center for Political Information, Alexey Muhin, admits that the Turkish president will change his view on relations with Russia as soon as it is convenient for him.
Eight months ago, Erdogan was taking a very tough stance on Russia and was doing everything he could to win the favor of the West.
In a very short time, the situation changed to the opposite.
There is no guarantee that the Turkish president will not change his priorities again after a while.
I think Erdogan has entered the era of shuttle diplomacy.
Being caught between two poles - the West and Russia, he will try to get the maximum benefit for himself", - believes Mukhin.
In his opinion, the main task for the Turkish president today is to maintain political power in the country, and for this he needs Russia and a partnership with Vladimir Putin, so that the US stops supporting Gülen.
Turkey needs both the EU and the US, which control the situation in Syria and the Middle East.
Therefore, a consensus with Turkey will be reached", the expert believes.
The head of Central Asia and the Middle East, Anna Glazova, has a different view.
Turkey's relations with the EU and the US are tense, primarily because of the domestic policy of Erdogan.
I think that this crisis in relations will worsen, and against this crisis the Turkish leadership will try to carry out a reset of policy both in the Middle East and in relations with Russia.
It is no accident that the Turkish president, as well as a number of Turkish politicians, declare that they are ready to change their position on a number of issues on Syria, relations with Israel are settled, active political interaction with Iran is underway", explained Aif.ru Glasova, who admits that Erdogan's next step will be the normalization of relations with Egypt.
She said Erdogan's current policy is a return to the foreign policy concept that Turkey followed before the Arab revolutions.
"It was then that Turkey began to develop its relations with the Middle East and the Asian region very actively with the position of 'zero problems with neighbours'.
The Turkish president's visits to Russia and African countries have been very successful.
Therefore, this foreign policy vector will develop and contribute to strengthening Turkey's positions both in the regional and international arena", the expert believes.
Glasova believes that it will be incredibly difficult for Turkey to return to its previous relationship with the EU, and the question now is whether the EU will respond harshly to Turkey, which could open its borders to migrants and create serious problems for Europe.
Junior doctors strike: Calls for new collective protests
Junior doctors have asked the union to sanction new collective protests in their dispute over the new employment contract.
The Junior Doctors Committee (JDC) of the British Medical Association (BMA) is going to ask their full council to support more collective protests from the beginning of September.
JDC says the ministers failed to answer questions about the employment contract.
Junior doctors and medical students voted in July to cancel the labor contract deal negotiated with the BMA.
It was rejected by 58% of its members who participated in a secret ballot.
In a letter to members posted on Twitter Thursday evening, JDC chairman Ellen McCourt said the government has continued to "keep silent" about the issues that she said led to the rejection of the labour contract.
She said, "In light of the situation, the head of the JDC has voted to reject the proposed new employment contract in its entirety and has called for formal renegotiation of all your issues".
In response to the government's silence, the head of the JDC today made an official request for an extraordinary meeting of the BMA Council to approve a continuous program of expanded collective protest, starting in early September.
The dispute has led to six strikes by young doctors this year, including the first general strike in the history of the Public Health Service.
The leader of the BMA's junior doctors, Dr. Joan Malavanna, resigned after voting to cancel the agreed terms of employment that the BMA recommended.
He told the BMA members that the deal was a good one to accept, during meetings in the run-up to the 54,000 junior doctors and medical students' vote.
After the vote, Health Minister Jeremy Hunt said that this contract would be used for health workers in England.
Russia and Turkey: "Alliance of the bad"?
It was a gesture that ended the crisis.
The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to shake hands and announce the official end of an eight-month war of words and economic sanctions.
But when Vladimir Putin greeted his Turkish counterpart in the gilded hall of the palace in St. Petersburg, I got the strong impression that Ankara wanted this reconciliation more.
There was a handshake, yes.
But Mr. Putin's smile was tense, and he barely radiated warmth even by his own restrained standards.
Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, by contrast, has spoken repeatedly about his "dear friend" to Mr. Putin - five times, according to one report.
I lost count.
He also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their pre-crisis level, but even higher.
The next day, a newspaper described Mr. Erdogan's actions as if nothing bad had ever happened.
I think his enthusiasm suggested otherwise.
But the lingering chill coming from Mr. Putin showed that the Russian leader hadn't forgotten anything.
In fact, the crisis was caused by the first thing he mentioned in his opening remarks: Turkey shot down a Russian fighter on the Syrian border.
Moscow's reaction at this point was furious.
Mr. Putin was furious, accusing Ankara of backing Moscow.
The insult was even more intense coming from a supposed friend.
Rebuilding real trust will be difficult, perhaps not possible.
Russian public opinion has also changed since November.
For months, the state-controlled media has been conducting a stunning, all-out assault on Ankara.
Suddenly, it seems that the Turks are to blame for everything.
The most serious accusations were from senior officials that Mr. Erdogan's own family had made money from the illegal oil trade from the areas of Syria controlled by the so-called Islamic State.
He denied it emphatically.
But St. Petersburg received an official signal that it was time to move on.
After all, this meeting only happened because Mr. Putin got the apology he demanded from President Erdogan.
Russia could claim victory for its own kind.
For Ankara, the benefits of a ceasefire are clear.
First of all, Erdogan needs all the friends he can get after he was nearly ousted from his post last month in a coup attempt.
The repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey have clearly shaken him up too.
There's also an economic reason.
Russian sanctions have hit hard  especially the ban on charter flights, which normally bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast annually.
The numbers have dropped sharply by almost 90%.
As for Russia, tour operators and charter companies here will of course feel a sense of relief when flights are finally resumed.
They're betting on the peak of the end of the Mediterranean season.
And even this week, state TV predicted cheaper fruits and vegetables once Turkish agricultural imports are allowed again.
"Tourists go there, tomatoes come back here", as the Vedomosti newspaper reported.
But the visit also had an additional political value for Moscow.
Ankara is angry with the West for what it considers a weak response to the coup attempt.
Add to this her protracted discontent with the turtle-like pace of EU accession talks and Mr. Putin's move to take advantage of the chill and gradually break Turkish ties with the West.
The Russian leader, of course, won bonus points with Ankara for calling for the support of elected authorities after the coup attempt.
Keep in mind, this is a given for Moscow, which has its own deep-rooted regime change fears.
So, the summit in this shining palace on the seafront has allowed Russia and Turkey to present what one analyst described to me as "an alliance of the bad": two countries that feel rejected and humiliated by the West are joining forces.
Yet, despite the public display of reconciliation, the two still have significant differences.
The key is Syria, where Moscow has recently positioned itself as a peacemaker, but where Russia and Turkey are supporting opposing sides.
Perhaps it speaks for itself that after nearly three hours of initial negotiations, while the two presidents were giving a press conference, they didn't even bring up the subject.
The Turkish president deliberately avoided answering the question about their differences, while Mr. Putin preferred to focus on them.
There's no clear consensus on how they can find common ground on Syria.
But after months of open hostility and considering the possibility of total disaster when NATO member Turkey shot down a Russian jet fighter, it's definitely better that the two leaders are at least talking again.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will disappear for customers outside Scotland
The RBS brand should be reduced to a back office role, according to the bank's chief executive.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will disappear for customers outside Scotland.
Ross McEwan told BBC Scotland that the RBS brand was linked to the bank's global ambitions.
The bank has fallen from grace since it nearly collapsed eight years ago and needed rescuing.
During this period, brand strategists used "RBS" to protect other consumer lending brands.
It has been supported by millions of pounds of sponsorship aid to international sport, from the Six Nations Rugby Cup to Wimbledon champion Andy Murray.
But now it was decided that it was right to allow more national brands to come to the fore.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will be used with Scottish customers, but will not be launched.
In England and Wales, all references to RBS, including the external head office and the stock exchange, will be changed to NatWest.
The Ulster Bank brand is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.
There are other, smaller brands for private banking that will get more influence  Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond and Holt's Military Bank.
Mr McEwan was interviewed during a customer and employee tour of Invernessshire.
He told BBC Scotland: "The RBS brand will eventually become our investment brand and the one that our staff will be employed in, because we are now becoming more of a brand bank".
Just as the bank itself became a global brand, RBS became a global brand.
I'm saying now that we don't have global ambitions anymore, we have local ambitions.
Each of these brands will represent something completely different in their respective populations, and our staff will work with clients under these brands.
RBS has already stated that it will not be continuing its sponsorship of the Six Nations Cup, and it is raising the profile of various brands in its sponsorship of the sport.
"This is an appropriate time for us to move the brand bank forward, as at the core (we asked ourselves) how do we focus on improving the bank for customers?" said the CEO.
It would have been very cynical three years ago if we said we were going to be a great bank for customers and shut down all these brands.
But with the work that we've done, focusing on the needs of the customer rather than our own, I think you see a lot of change.
We can get those brands back, so I think it's time.
Frankie Dettorie reaches 3,000 winners with a win at Newmarket on the Prejudice.
Dettori splashing champagne after a double at Newmarket leads him to 3,000 wins.
Jockey Frankie Dettori claimed his 3,000th British victory at Newmarket on Friday.
He came to this remarkable mark with the help of his second win of the night on his home track - the Pre-Act, trained by John Gosden.
The 45-year-old Italian is the sixth jockey to reach this milestone in smooth racing.
He is followed by Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Piggott, Pat Idder and Willie Carson.
Three-time champion jockey Dettori, who had previously won at Ghayyar, said: "It's something special".
I'm really excited because my family's here, too.
I'm very happy that it happened in Newmarket, because that's where I settled 30 years ago.
This is not a big secular event, this is not Royal Ascot. It's just a normal Friday night with 20,000 people.
I'm free from work and very unpretentious.
Dettori receives applause when he brings Preposition after victory
Two jockeys have achieved this mark in the obstacle course: champion jockey Richard Johnson and retired 20-time champion Sir Anthony McCoy, who had over 4300 career victories.
Lester Piggott, nine-time winner of the Derby, 4493 wins in his career
Frankie is one of the greatest jockeys of the modern era, and it's no wonder that he has achieved a mark that so few have achieved before him.
He's stylish and strong, but it's his tactical acumen that sets him apart from the rest of the weight room.
He's a great representative of horse racing, and his enthusiasm and charisma have attracted fans to the sport for years.
I told Frankie a few weeks ago in Epsom, he'd have brought in 6,000 winners if he wasn't just a weekend jockey and a big race rider!
Seriously, Frankie has been leading the winners in the UK for the better part of 30 years, which is great to see.
He's a spirited character, which is good for British racing, but more than that, he's an incredible jockey.
Frankie Dettori celebrated this milestone with a signature, rapid, high-speed, horseback-back-sprint.
From his fast finishes to his rapid jumps, Frankie Dettori has been the face of British smooth racing for two decades.
It was ups and downs.
A host of big race winners, including his famous "Magnificent Seven" at Ascot in 1996, but he also survived a plane crash and was disqualified for doping.
Three years ago, he initially faced difficulties when he returned after a six-month suspension, but he showed tremendous willpower to challenge the skeptics and get back into shape.
And he may not be done for a while yet. Dettori has previously said that he would like to continue competing until at least age 50.
Putin is firing the head of the administration of the Sergey Ivanov
Russian President Vladimir Putin has unexpectedly fired his chief of staff, Sergei Ivanov.
Ivanov has been part of Putin's trusted inner circle for many years.
The 63-year-old has now been appointed representative for the environment and transport.
A statement from the Kremlin said that Putin "decided to relieve Ivanov of his duties as head of the Russian presidential administration", but did not specify the reason.
Mr. Ivanov's deputy since 2012, Anton Vaino, was appointed his successor.
Mr. Vaino, 44, former diplomat.
Born in the Estonian capital of Tallinn in 1972, he graduated from the prestigious Moscow State University of International Relations (MGIMO) and served in the Tokyo embassy.
He later served as head of the presidential protocol department and the government's office, according to the Kremlin website (in Russian).
At the time of his appointment, he told Putin, "Thank you for your trust".
I think the most important job of the administration is to support you as the head of state in terms of drafting laws and monitoring how your instructions are being followed.
Putin told a Russian TV channel on Friday that Ivanov had asked to be relieved of his post and recommended that Vaino replace him.
Does smiling convince?
It's a move that has mystified Moscow.
Sergei Ivanov was for a long time one of Vladimir Putin's closest supporters and, like him, served in the Soviet security service, the KGB.
As head of the administration, he was one of the most powerful men in the country.
In a meeting with President Putin, which was shown on state television, both men said that the head of the administration had resigned on his own.
But despite the smiles on camera, it hasn't convinced anyone here  especially now, right before the parliamentary elections.
So, these are the unintended consequences of some power struggle?
No one knows yet.
But the official statement that the man once touted as a potential president suddenly wanted to run Russia's environmental policy was met with enormous skepticism.
In remarks to Putin, quoted on the Kremlin website, Ivanov said: "It is true that in early 2012 I asked you in an interview to entrust me with this very difficult, even, one might say, problematic position for four years.
Well, it turns out I was the president's chief of staff for four years and eight months.
Ivanov took office in December 2011.
Previously, he served as Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defense.
He's a member of the Russian Security Council and a former member of the KGB's state security service, just like Mr. Putin.
In the late 1990s, when Putin was head of the Federal Security Service (FSB), which replaced the KGB, Ivanov was appointed his deputy.
When Putin came to power, he named Ivanov among the five people he trusted most.
It was once thought that Ivanov could become Russia's president after Putin's second term, as a third term for Putin would be unconstitutional.
However, this post was taken by another close Putin supporter, Dmitry Medvedev.
Putin became prime minister before returning to the presidency after only three and a half years.
"Think Like a Criminal" star Thomas Gibson is fired after a fight with a producer.
Gibson was involved in a fight on the set of a show in Los Angeles last month.
ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios, which produce the series, announced his termination in a joint statement.
Gibson, who played Special Agent Aaron Hotchner, apologized Thursday before his suspension was announced.
There were creative differences on the set and a difference of opinion.
I am sorry that this happened", he said in his statement.
Details of how Gibson's character will be cut from the show, which follows a team of FBI agents, are expected to be revealed later, according to statements from ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios.
The 54-year-old actor, who previously starred in the sitcom Darma and Greg, has been on the show since the first season in 2005.
"I love 'Think Like a Criminal' and have put my heart and soul into it for the past twelve years", Gibson said in a statement released Friday.
I was hoping to be there for the rest of it, but that's not gonna be possible.
I just want to thank the writers, the producers, the actors, our wonderful crew, and most of all, the best fans the show could ever have.
The show is set to return with its twelfth season on September 28.
Mystery: fish landed in Banff Gardens
A man from Banff asked for help identifying fish that had appeared in his garden in Banff.
Kevin Bain believes that the 75 fish could have been sand grains left behind by the water whirlwind.
Baine, who lives 500 yards offshore, posted the footage of this spectacle in the Periscope in the hope that someone could shed some light on the appearance of the two-inch fish.
Queensferry Crossing: The bridge is now connected to Fife
The £1.35 billion project is now due to be completed by May 2017
The engineers have connected the northern span and the Queensferry Crossing viaduct, which means the bridge is now connected to Fife.
This is the first of four connections between the "weera" (wind-up) lines that are now coming to a close near all three bridge pylons.
The section of the bridge from Fife is now 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 tons.
It has 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 bridge spans.
The £1.35 billion project is now due to be completed by May 2017.
Secretary of Commerce Keith Brown visited the site today and was among the first to walk from the ground to the bridge.
He said: "This is a historic and symbolic moment in the construction of the Queensferry Crossing.
We're all witnessing engineering on a truly epic scale in this project, where over 30,000 tons of concrete and steel were used to build this part of the bridge alone.
Despite the massive size and weight of the bridge, the completion of the connection between the viaduct and the bridge canopy is a virtuoso operation using extremely accurate tolerances for assembly.
In total, about 79% of the entire bridge canvas is now in place, for the last section of the canvas the concrete coating is poured in Rosayte today, which means that the whole canvas is ready to be lifted into place on the bridge.
Michael Martin, project manager for Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors, said: "The first link in any bridge project is always a significant milestone.
In this stunning project, this interlocking is the ultimate in modern construction.
After the last section of the road was installed and connected to the expanding roadway of the North pylon, we then had to close the remaining gap on the northern  or the shore-facing  side.
This was done by pulling the north approach viaduct 700 millimeters south.
It was a very large-scale and very elegant operation.
It's massive because the viaduct is 222 meters long, weighs about 6,000 tons and had to be raised to an angle of about 3 percent.
Elegant, because the assumptions the team worked on were tiny -- just a few millimeters in each direction.
Thankfully, it all went very well.
Rescue in Moelfr Bay: Three men 'luckily came out of it alive'
Three men 'luckily survived' after being thrown from a fishing vessel in Anglesey.
Moelfre RNLI rescue station raised the alarm at 13:20 British Summer Time on Friday after a team saw an incident unfolding in Moelfre Bay.
The three men struggled to reach safety, while their boat kept going.
"We saw their boat circling nearby and assumed the worst", said Moelfre's lifeboat steward Vince Jones.
"Fortunately, by the time we got down to the water, a strong wind had blown it away from them", he added.
Two men were rescued by a local fishing boat, and a third man in his 60s was found exhausted and stuck in the bay without a life jacket.
They were all lifted onto a lifeboat and taken to a rescue station.
Jones said: "The three men who were thrown into the water were lucky to be alive and completely unharmed.
The boat's engine had a safety switch, but it somehow got loose from the person operating the boat when it capsized.
Someone was watching these guys today.
Pokémon Go, a worthy hunt for health and happiness
It's exciting to see the world change.
The fact that children and teenagers are no longer going outside to play, preferring to spend their free time staring at screens, has been a complaint of many over the last decade.
Pokemon Go is ripping people off the couch and getting them into some physical activity.
Screen time was first limited to TV, then video games, and more recently, smartphones.
It's so great to see that technology and street activity are not mutually exclusive.
I am, of course, referring to the popular craze that is Pokémon Go, a character-based application originally created for video games in the 1990s (which later spawned a series of cartoons, playing cards and other offshoots).
Like many other pop culture phenomena, it was all but lost its relevance before the new game became available in the US, Australia and New Zealand in early July.
Launch in other countries at the time was delayed due to a massive response that overloaded the servers.
In a matter of days, Pokémon Go had more users than Tinder and almost as many as Twitter.
So how does it work?
In a nutshell, smartphone players go looking for Pokémon that are tracked by GPS and, when found, can be 'photographed' (via a screenshot on your phone) or 'caught'.
The generation that played the game when they were younger joined the craze, getting off the couch to look.
In the United States, the game has led to a significant increase in the number of steps taken by the "ordinary" person on a daily basis.
Cardiogram, an app for the Apple Watch that tracks 35,000 users, recently reported to the Washington Post that within two days of launching the game, the number of people it tracked who exercised for 30 minutes a day jumped from 45 percent to 53 percent.
The company doesn't know who's playing Pokémon Go, they just see the raw data on the level pass.
Many health campaigns that tell people to "find 30 minutes", "get off the couch", and "be active every day" have failed to gain traction because most health messages are boring and come from people who look unhappy.
However, the importance of exercise cannot be underestimated.
Those who exercise regularly reduce their chances of developing cancer or depression.
Physical activity helps with weight management, high blood pressure, diabetes, and a long list of benefits too long to list here.
But the beauty of Pokémon Go is that it gets people out to do things they love.
So the three foundations of health are covered: movement, fresh air and sunlight and joy.
Some people even make new friends on the hunt.
As usual, there are boring bums looking for something to complain about.
And yes, someone might come through the door.
What's the matter?
There's been a breakthrough.
Because while smartphone apps like Fitbit have been able to track our physical activity, they haven't given us the opportunity to exercise like this game has.
The new thing will arrive, and the use will weaken with time.
However, due to the success of Pokemon, more games will be coming out that will combine apps and virtual reality with physical activity in the real world, helping many people on the hunt to be more active, fit and healthy.

Simone Bayles wins the gold medal in women 's gymnastics .
Forget about the pressure.
Forget about the commotion.
Simone Bayles is invulnerable to all of this.
Dynamic on the leap.
Unnecessary on the log.
Stunning on the floor.
It's amazing all over.
And now, finally, the Olympic champion.
A 19-year-old American gymnast rose to the title of absolute champion on Thursday, closing the gap between herself and the rest of the world in a convincing demonstration under the scrutiny of the Olympics.
Her overall score of 62.198 was a considerable distance from silver medalist and "Final Five" team mate Eli Raisman and Russian bronze medalist Aliya Mustafina.
Bails of the United States performs on a gymnastic pole during the final of the women's individual all-around artistic gymnastics final at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, on Thursday.
Byles became the fourth American woman in a row to win the title of the absolute champion and the fifth overall, cementing her reputation as the best of her generation and perhaps ever.
She cried when she was shown her final score and her long journey was over by then.
This achievement puts her in the same league as exceptionally rare track and field athletes like Michael Phelps, who have taken their sports to new heights:
Baillie spent the last three years dominating her sport, winning 15 world championship medals - including 10 golds - with such mind-boggling programs in their blend of diligence and precision that 1984 Olympic champion Mary Lou Retton called her "the greatest gymnast I have ever seen".
One final test was in Brazil, a contest not so much between Byles and the rest of the field, as between her and a load of overblown expectations.
Anything less than going back to your family's home in Spring, Texas, with a handful of gold medals, would be considered an unwarranted expectation.
Simona Bayles of the United States, left, and Eli Reisman embrace after winning gold and silver respectively in the final of the women's individual all-around artistic gymnastics competition at the 2016 Summer Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Thursday, Aug. 4, 2016.
Bayles earned her first gold on Tuesday, becoming a beautiful final chord for the farewell party of retiring national team coordinator Martha Caroly.
While Biles insisted she never looked into the future during her long climb to the top, that's not entirely true.
Part of her free exercise program, which includes her signature passage, is set to Latin music that would fit right at home on the street just outside the Rio Olympic Arena.
It's not a coincidence.
The girl, adopted by her grandparents, being a toddler and open mother to coach Aimee Burman during a visit to the gym where Burman was a coach, became a force.
She hasn't lost a singles title since the summer of 2013 - a streak that should continue as long as Bayles wants it to.
Even though Mustafina had gained a small advantage with two spins, it was a mirage.
Gymnastic pole vault and free exercise, where Bayles is defending his world title, are in the air.
She again led with 15.433 on the log and finished with 15.933 on the floor.
Reisman gently embraced her as they waited for the final tally  pure formality  and tears appeared around the gleaming red with white and blue lining for Bayles' eyes when the plot she once recorded in the scrapbook came to fruition.
Reisman's performance was a small revenge for what happened four years ago when she shared third place but lost the bronze to Mustafina in a tie-break.
This time, the 22-year-old team captain, whom the Americans call "grandma", was way ahead.
She was sending kisses to the crowd after her free practice, embraced by a return that sometimes seemed questionable.
As for Bails, the 19-year-old's viral tweet from earlier this week now has a whole new meaning:
Police: 3 victims in a serial killer case shot while listening to music in a car
Two women and a 12-year-old girl who died in the deadliest attack by a Phoenix first-time serial killer in a decade were sitting in a car talking and listening to music when they were shot, according to police reports released Thursday.
Angela Rochelle Leiner, Stephanie R. Ellis and Ellis' daughter, Malia, were shot on June 12 when their car was parked in the driveway, authorities said.
The perpetrator fired approximately eight shots from a pistol while standing on the passenger side of the vehicle, then fled in another vehicle, the report said.
Police say the triple homicide doesn't appear to be the result of a robbery, as the assailant did not take the wallet or $2,900 that was in the possession of one of the adult victims.
Phoenix police spokesman Sergeant Jonathan Howard said the shooting prompted investigators to look into whether he was connected to four previous attacks.
A total of seven people were killed and two others injured in nine attacks in two predominantly Latino neighborhoods over a four-month period.
"It's happening in a residential area in front of the house", Howard told KPHO, a CBS affiliate, earlier this month.
The suspect is believed to have taken advantage of several vehicles, including a brown late 1990s Nissan, a black late 1990s BMW, and a white Cadillac or Lincoln.
Investigators have refused to reveal evidence that led them to conclude that the attacks are linked and were committed by the same killer.
Ellis, 33, was hospitalized with injuries and later died.
Liner, 31, and Ellis' daughter Malia were killed instantly.
A witness told police there was nothing unusual about them sitting in a parked car listening to music.
Authorities also released a police report of a shooting targeting an empty pickup truck half an hour before the triple homicide, and believed to be the work of a serial killer.
Investigators found the casings and pulled the bullet from the seat and the bullet fragments from the engine compartment.
Mother of 6-year-old with microcephaly: "It's getting better"
Like most six-year-olds, Edmond Picciotto loves singing, toys and, of course, his mother.
But unlike most of his peers, Edmund has microcephaly, the result of a genetic disorder that his mother, Elizabeth Pixiwoto, was unaware of during her pregnancy.
When he first came home, my first thought was, "I can't do this".
I can't do that.
I didn't sign up for this.
Which, in fact, is not true. Of course you're signing up for it", she said.
She and her husband, Vincent, were told that Edmund might never know them and that he might not even survive.
Some doctors even recommended that he be sent to a specialized facility.
"My first response was, 'I didn't think people did that anymore,'" Pixivto explained.
Edmund walks with the help of walker.
Edmund didn't sit down and crawl until he was three, and he still doesn't talk.
But it's slow to go through some stages.
He walks with a cane and rides a bicycle.
He also likes to play with his two brothers and sing.
Elizabeth shows the gesture that Edmund has devised for "please sing to me".
"We are teaching him sign language", Pixivoto told CBS News.
But not just any sign language - she says Edmund invented his own gestures.
Microcephaly can be caused by a number of different things: genetic, like Edmund's, infections during pregnancy from viruses like measles and Zika.
The symptoms and prognosis can vary significantly.
It's too early to tell how this will affect the lives of those infected with Zika.
Pixivto recalls the emotional loss of an uncertain future.
I keep telling you what's going to happen?
What's going to happen?
And she still doesn't know.
I didn't actually ask for a life-long prognosis because I didn't expect anyone to actually be able to tell me.
But Pixiwto has some encouraging advice for mothers of children with birth defects due to Zika.
It gets better.
You know that everything will be better for you.
You will love your child, and your child will love you.
Heavy rain, flooding causes rescue efforts in Louisiana, Mississippi
Heavy rain and widespread flooding in Louisiana forced the governor to declare a state of emergency on Friday, with more rain expected to fall across the state through Saturday.
Numerous rivers in southeast Louisiana and southern Mississippi have flooded and are threatening widespread flooding after extreme rainfall, the National Weather Service reported.
Louisiana Governor John Bell Edwards said state officials were in constant contact with local authorities and aid had already been sent to affected parishes.
Mike Steele, the governor's Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Preparedness, said there are requests for high-water transportation, boats and sandbags.
Steele said that the Tangipahoa parish alone requested tens of thousands of sandbags.
A flood warning remains in effect through Saturday for much of south Louisiana.
The Met Office said in a statement that an additional 3 by 5 inches could wash over the area.
In southern Alabama, flood watches were in place until Friday as rain continued to fall in the Mobile area.
The Comet River near Baton Rouge and the Emmit River near Denny Springs, both in Louisiana, were both projected to set record flood levels this past weekend.
Weatherman Alec Krautmann said that both rivers could have flooded many homes in suburban areas near Baton Rouge.
He also said that the flooding downstream in Assenshen parish is a threat, as these swollen rivers will slowly flow into Lake Morpa.
The Reika Tiqfo, just south of the Mississippi border in Liverpool, Louisiana, reached its highest ever recorded levels at 9am on Friday.
Rescue workers were still pulling people from floodwaters in Emit and Wilkinson counties in southwest Mississippi.
Leroy Hansford, his wife and stepchildren were among those rescued earlier Friday outside Gloucester.
Hansford, 62, says the waters of Beaver Creek, which is normally more than 400 feet from his home, rose rapidly overnight.
He said another stepson who lives nearby warned him.
"We woke up and the water kept coming", Hansford said.
It's up to my waist.
His wife told Hansford it was the largest influx she'd seen in the 48 years she'd lived here.
Hansford said that he and all the members of his family have disabilities, and he's the only one who can swim.
Hansford said rescue workers rescued all three with the help of an army truck and took them to a fire station in Gloucester, where they were holed up on Friday.
Krautmann says the flooding is "spreading rapidly" as the rains continue, noting that officials are considering evacuation orders.
Krautmann says that one observer near Livingston reported 13.75 inches of rain from midnight to Friday morning.
Krautmann said the soil was saturated with rainfall from the environment.
Heavy rains and flooding have led to evacuations of homes in Tangipahoa Parish and the cancellation of classes in five school districts, authorities say.
WWL, a CBS affiliate, reports that Councillor Tandjipahoa spoke of 200 flooded homes.
Residents were evacuated to two churches, but both are now flooded.
Parish chairman Robbie Miller said authorities had rescued 72 people and seven pets from the high water.
Shelters were opened in the town of Aymet and the town of Hammond to accommodate those who had been evacuated.
"They will be able to return home as soon as the water begins to recede", he said.
In the town of Hammond in the parish of Tangipahoa, about two dozen streets were closed due to high water levels, and sandbags were made available for residents to hand out in the hope that they would keep water away from homes and businesses.
"The last major flood we had was in March", said city manager Lacey Landrum.
It's on its way to becoming a similar event.
In Mississippi, Harrison County, the head of the Emergency Services, Rupert Lacey, said that the heavy rains continued to fall on the Gulf of Mexico coast.
He said several homes were reported flooded on Thursday, but none were reported on Friday.
Kate Towson, the head of Shopper Value Foods in Emit, has lived in the area for 40 years.
"I've seen water in places I've never seen it before", said Towson, "and it's still pouring on the ground".
Mahaj Brown, 6, "cut by bullets", survives after a shooting in Philadelphia
Police are reporting the shooting of a 6-year-old boy in Philadelphia, the second shooting of a 6-year-old in the city this week.
The baby's grandparents identified him to CBS Philadelphia as Mahwah Brown.
Grandparents say Brown received multiple gunshot wounds, including his thigh, leg, arm and abdomen, but was conscious when he was transported to the hospital.
"He was in a bad way, his little body was riddled with bullets", his grandmother Delores Melendez told the station.
I just can't believe this.
The boy is in critical condition in the hospital and has undergone several surgeries.
The family told the station they expected him to recover.
He was supposed to be in first grade at the local elementary school.
Brown was one of four people shot in the Germantown neighborhood.
Three men were also shot: two 29-year-olds and one 32-year-old.
One of the 29-year-old men is reported to be in critical condition; the other two victims were reported to be in stable condition, according to CBS Philadelphia.
A child was found shot to death in the front seat of a car alongside a 29-year-old in critical condition, the station reports.
The other two victims were not in the car, and police are investigating whether any of the wounded men could have been the shooter.
Investigators report to CBS in Philadelphia that there appears to have been a shootout between several armed men.
Semi-automatic weapon casings attributed to various examples of semi-automatic weapons have been found at the scene.
It certainly seems like a long battle.
There were shells on the street, on both sides of the sidewalk.
So it looks like there were a few armed fighters and they were actively involved in the shooting", Philadelphia Police Captain Anthony Giannaldi told the station.
Many homes and cars in the area were also hit.
No arrests have been made, and police are reportedly reviewing CCTV.
Another 6-year-old child, a girl, was hit in the hand by a stray bullet on Tuesday while playing outside her home in the West Oak Lane area.
She's recovering, and the police are still looking for a suspect.
Why do we need Simon, Gabby and Laurie?
That's what I call this year's women's Olympic gymnastics team, and for a number of reasons.
First of all, I've been to every Summer Olympics since 1984, and the United States has never been this dominant.
And second, the three gymnasts who are the key players in this team are Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Lori" Hernandez, who have already inspired so many non-white girls.
The lineup of this team, which is complemented by Eli Reisman, who is Jewish, and Madison Koshan, who is Catholic, makes everyone proud.
This team finally looks like America.
It also strengthened the presence of black and Latino women at the top of the sport.
For the past four years, the number one female gymnast has been an African-American.
Last year, Simone and Gabby were number one and number two.
It's powerful.
At the last Olympics, Gabby Douglas was the surprise Olympic champion, and America cheered.
Now the world could witness the incredible performances of three-time World Champion Simona Byles, Douglas and Lori Hernandez, performing unexpected but nevertheless virtuoso gymnastic exercises.
On Thursday, Simone became the fourth American in a row to win gold in the women's individual all-around.
And team mate Eli Reisman earned silver.
We're witnessing the peak of this sport, but it doesn't look like this in gyms across the country.
Simone, Gabby and Laurie all chose the same path as Eli and Madison to make the Olympic team.
They're the "final five" because the next Olympic gymnastics team will only have four gymnasts on the team, and this is the last year of Marta Caroly's coaching.
But in reality, gymnastics is an expensive sport, and gymnasts first train in private gymnastics clubs, supported by parents who pay for tuition, equipment, travel, uniform, fees for participation in competitions, hotel services (for trainers and their gymnasts and families), and the list goes on.
Most of these gyms are located in wealthy suburban neighborhoods that can support this business.
These clubs are where gymnasts get all their training, and it's an expensive and long-term liability for gymnasts' families.
Amy Burman, Simona Byles's coach, and Maggie Hani, Laurie Hernandez's coach, have both been coaching their athletes since they took up gymnastics.
We need to create more affordable and accessible gym education for communities of countless young girls inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie.
I started my gymnastics foundation 20 years ago.
My organizations have already provided free and low-cost gym classes, located in Harlem, to over 15,000 urban youth (mostly black and Latino youth) and have produced national and international champions.
In September, we'll be expanding to Detroit, my hometown, to provide high-quality gymnastics to young people who deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport.
Gymnastics develops strength, flexibility, and coordination for the body, as well as endurance for strenuous work, discipline, and persistence for the mind.
This combination has a lifelong positive effect on good health, success in school and at work.
It's the inspiration of this team that's going to send thousands of girls to gymnastics, and that's great.
It's so important to do sports, especially for girls.
It's such a wonderful time.
Thank you, Simone, Eli, Laurie, Gabby and Madison, for this serious display of Women Power in winning Olympic team gold, and for motivating so many girls from all backgrounds to be healthy, strong, and successful young women.
Junior doctors have called for further strikes after Jeremy Hunt 's proposal was rejected .
Ministers hoped to end the debate over the changes by agreeing a revised contract with the leaders of the British Medical Association, but 58 percent of the 37,000 young doctors who took part in the vote rejected it.
In July, Hunt announced plans to introduce the contract, saying the NHS was in "no man's land" and any further delay would hurt staff and patients.
The first junior doctors are transferred to a new contract that includes changes to night work and weekends to improve after-hours care.
Dr. Ellen McCott, chair of the BMA's Young Doctors' Committee, said in a statement last night: "Young doctors still have serious concerns about the proposed contract, in particular that it will fuel the current workforce crisis and that it cannot be applied to all doctors equitably".
We have only eight weeks left before the first group of doctors are transferred to a new contract, progress is needed, and time is running out.
The WMA's attempt to resolve the dispute through negotiations has been met with reluctance to act and sometimes complete silence on the part of the government.
And that's despite Jeremy Hunt's promise last month that his door was always open.
"Jeremy Hunt needs to act now, to encourage the introduction and respond to the concerns of junior doctors.
If he doesn't, then the junior doctors are clear that they are ready to organize the next strike.
The latest strike in late April brought about 13,000 postponed scheduled operations and 100,000 nurses' visits, while nurses and counselors were brought in to ensure replacement of doctors on the picket lines.
Ministers hoped to end the dispute over the changes by agreeing a revised contract with the leaders of the British Medical Association.
The VMA wants better pay for the 54,000 junior doctors who will be covered by the contract.
Daniel Mortimer, CEO of NHS Employers, has urged junior doctors not to continue the strike.
Mortimer stated: "Strikes achieve little or nothing, but they put pressure on already operating teams and services, and cause anxiety, physical pain and distress to patients, caregivers and their families".
Over the past two months, we've been talking to the Junior Physicians Committee and working with the Department of Health and others to positively address their concerns about the role of caregivers and corporate disclosure policies.
Workers hoped that the continued positive support on other important issues  such as staff allocation, learning flexibility, additional training for those returning from a career break, tuition costs, mutual recognition of the curriculum, academic leave and gender pay gaps in medicine  were a sign of how seriously employers, Health Education England and the Department of Health were going to take the terms reached by the WMA in November, February and May.
A £ 2 a day pill could reduce the risk of heart attack
Thousands of heart attack patients are set to take the £2 a day drug after the authorities recommended it be given to more people and for longer periods.
The anti-seizure drug, tigrecalor, reduces the risk of recurrence of seizures for people with heart disease.
It's already being prescribed for 12 months after a heart attack, reducing the risk of stroke or a second heart attack.
The National Health Service's (NICE) oversight service in the United Kingdom has advised that it should be given to people for four years to avoid the risk of cardiovascular problems in the future.
But now the NHS's NICE watchdog has recommended that people take it for four years to avoid the risk of cardiovascular problems.
Heart attacks occur in approximately 140,000 people in England each year, and a quarter of those have another attack or stroke.
Heart attacks and strokes are caused by the buildup of fatty material on the walls of arteries and the formation of plaques.
If the plaque ruptures, it can cause a clot to form, blocking blood flow to the heart and causing a heart attack.
And if the clot moves, it can move through the bloodstream and block the blood flow to the brain, causing a stroke.
People who have had one attack are at greater risk of having another.
Ticagrelor, produced by the British company AstraZeneca and marketed as Brilique, reduces the risk by making blood clots less likely.
The draft NICE guideline, published today, recommends that people take 90 mg of ticagrelor for 12 months, then 60 mg with aspirin twice a day for the next three years.
Professor Carol Longson, director of NICE's Centre for Health Technology Assessment, said: "Despite the availability of effective secondary prevention, about a quarter of people who have had a heart attack will have another heart attack or stroke - often with devastating consequences".
Fear of repetition can have a significant negative impact on a person's quality of life.
There is evidence that ticagrelor, when combined with aspirin, is effective in reducing the risk of subsequent heart attacks and strokes in people who have already had a heart attack.
By pre-suggesting ticagrelor, we are excited to be able to increase the treatment options available to the many thousands of people who are willing to use it.
As information on the efficacy and safety of ticagrelor - especially the risk of bleeding - beyond three years is limited, the draft guidance does not recommend treatment beyond this time.
The culture of PC ownership allows for the falsification of vote counting in Muslim areas
The former mayor of Tower Hamlets, Luthfur Rahman, was removed from office last year for corruption, prompting a government inquiry.
The culture of political correctness has led to a blind eye, which has resulted in widespread vote-counting fraud in Muslim communities, according to information from a damaging government report released today.
Former Cabinet member Sir Eric Pickles lashes out at police, election observers and city officials for ignoring evidence of election irregularities due to "excessive sensitivity to race and religion".
The former secretary of local communities, now an anti-corruption czar, reported that voter intimidation on religious grounds was so strong that police should be allowed to put cordonettes outside polling stations to protect frightened voters.
He's proposing that voters take IDs to prove who they are when they vote.
At this point, all the voters have to do is provide their name and address.
The report even suggests putting indelible ink on people's fingers when they turn in their ballots, to prevent someone from voting twice.
Better protection for whistle-blowers is needed, Sir Eric said.
He calls for greater access to local council documents and decisions made by informal committees or working groups.
"This is not only to protect against election fraud, but also to protect the local government from a more open culture of corruption and financial fraud that goes hand in hand with it", he said.
The report was commissioned by Downing Street in the wake of the Tower Hamlets vote scandal in East London.
Last year, a special election court ruled that incumbent mayor Lufthur Rahman should be removed from office over a long list of corrupt and illegal activities.
The court found that Rahman "cynically distorted" the religious sentiments of his Muslim community and silenced his critics by accusing them of racism and Islamophobia.
Rahman, it was said, "had campaigned on the basis that it was the duty of believing Muslims to vote for him".
Up to 300 votes were questionable or the result of impersonation, where a person votes while posing as someone else.
Sir Eric said there were fraudulent accounts all over the country.
He expressed particular concern over mail-in voting fraud, in which senior members of the Muslim community were reportedly pressuring people to vote for their chosen candidate.
Sir Eric, pictured, made several recommendations for the cleanup of the voting system, including requiring you to bring your ID to prove who you are.
Its report states: "Evidence was presented of pressure on vulnerable members of some ethnic minority communities, particularly women and youth, to vote according to the will of their elders, especially in communities of Pakistani and Bangladeshi origin.
"There were concerns that... government agencies had turned a blind eye to such behavior due to an oversensitivity to 'political correctness' around ethnicity and religion".
Sir Eric made 50 recommendations to clean up the system, including removing political activists from the mail-in ballot to stop the "harvesting of votes".
The report, under review by Theresa May, also calls for tighter checks on registration to prevent the use of voter rolls for immigration and privilege fraud.
The idea of requiring voters to show their ID before voting is being considered.
Using non-washable ink on people's fingers as soon as they throw their ballot to prevent anyone from voting twice.
To systematically check people's nationality to make sure they're eligible to vote.
To impose a three-year limit on applications for automatic postal voting.
Discourage political campaigners and activists from working with filled-in absentee ballots and postal ballots.
Give the police the power to set up cordon around the polling stations.
To amend the law to make it easier for people to be charged with intimidation under the Representation of the People Act 1983.
Make it illegal to take pictures at polling stations.
To require that only English be used at polling stations (except in Wales).
Increase training to ensure that staff make voters go to the polls one by one.
Sir Eric has attacked the Metropolitan Police, saying it was "astonishing" that no criminal charges had been brought since Tower Hamlets.
"The court dealing with election issues disqualified Lutfur Rahman and his agent for a long list of corrupt and illegal actions", he said.
He was found guilty beyond a reasonable doubt by the criminal standard of proof on a number of grounds.
He also criticizes the fruitless "check for tick" of the electoral registration departments of city administrations.
Sir Eric said: "Last year's Tower Hamlets judgment was a wake-up call.
Our nation has a proud heritage as the mother of parliamentary elections, and yet the alarming and covert spread of electoral fraud and the state of denial by some bodies threatens that good reputation.
Crazy cycling analogues Kate and other celebrities duplicates the Rio Olympics
Fans of the 2016 Rio Olympics this week went crazy for French cyclist Pauline Ferran-Prévot, who turned out to be a striking resemblance to the Duchess of Cambridge.
But the 24-year-old Olympic competitor is far from the only female athlete vying for gold this summer who can boast of her own famous double, at least according to social media reports.
So, in honor of the Rio Games and all the celebrities who appear on our screens at this time, FEMAIL has compiled a list of Olympians who have more than a superficial resemblance to Hollywood stars.
Hunter and the Wolf: U.S. men's archery team member Brady Ellison, left, has been compared to Leonardo DiCaprio since he was a child
In addition to Kate's doppelganger on the bike path, many people online have hastily pointed out how a certain archer could be the twin of superstar Leonardo DiCaprio.
U.S. men's archery team member Brady Ellison has caused a firestorm on Twitter after images of him looking eerily similar to the Wall Street star Wolf surfaced.
And in fact, the archer learned about the craziness of social media and admitted that he had been told that he looked like Leo since he was a kid.
"I personally don't see a huge similarity, maybe except for the vegetation on the face", Brady told the Huffington Post.
"He's a good-looking guy, so I guess that's a compliment".
One of the most popular comparisons from London 2012 will no doubt be pointed out even more this year: the striking similarity between British jumper Greg Rutherford and popular actor Neil Patrick Harris.
Russian gymnast Aliya Mustafina, with her large expressive eyes, is said to be a copy of Cuban-American singer Gloria Estefan.
And in the pool, South African swimmer Cameron Van der Burgh has been compared to the star of the Choir, Matthew Morrison, for years.
Moving on to the more unexpected: This user believes that Nathan  is the "sports version" of the actor "Nachala"
Another long-running comparison was between tennis player Rafael Nadar and actor Josh Harnett, who both boast similar heavy eyebrows and lips.
Silver medalist swimmer Yulia Efimova of Russia boasts not only the same tan skin and blond hair as actress AnneLynn McCord, while Nathan Adrian of the US team, according to fans, looks like "the sports version of Joseph Gorgon Levitt".
The tough women: football star Hope Solo, left, and actress Jennifer Carpenter from Dexter, right, have the same face and eye shapes
Not the only one: One Twitter user was very pleased that others also saw the similarities.
According to this user, there may be an underlying reason behind the similar appearance of this couple.
One Twitter user recently took to the site to express his delight that "the rest of the Internet thinks that Hope Solo and Jennifer Carpenter are actually identical".
In fact, the U.S. Soccer star and the Dexter actress have incredibly similar facial features and eyes.
Other popular comparisons included Kerri Walsh Jennings and her smile, which is close to the identical smile of actress Laura Linney, as well as gold medal-winning gymnast Gabby Douglas, who boasts of her own beautiful wide smile, which is similar to that of "Success" star Gabrielle Union.
CBC Olympics commentator apologizes for saying Chinese swimmer 'died like a pig'
Fourth-place finisher Bayron Macdonald's analysis of 14-year-old Ai Yanhan's 4x200m freestyle relay has upset the CBC audience in the live broadcast of the Olympics.
The Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) was forced to apologize after one of its commentators said a 14-year-old Chinese swimmer "started like a pig" and "died like a pig" while swimming.
Commentator Byron McDonald thought his microphone was off when he began to express his own opinion at the end of the women's 4x200m freestyle relay final.
MacDonald, who was brought on to the CBC commentary team to "scramble her", was heard saying, "That 14-year-old Chinese girl dropped the ball, baby".
Too excited, started off like a pig, died like a pig.
Thank you for that.
Chinese swimmer Ai Yanghan, 14, swam the second leg of the relay in 1:57.79 , 1.61 seconds slower than Canadian Taylor Rake, allowing the Canadians to close the gap to China.
Viewers across Canada quickly reacted online after being shocked by the tone and expressions used
Emmett McFarlane tweeted: "Is it true that the CBC anchor just said that a 14-year-old swimmer from China 'died like a pig'????"
That idiot didn't realize they were still on the air".
They said, "This little 14-year-old Chinese girl dropped the ball, baby".
Twitter criticism immediately hit Byron McDonald, with many calling for his firing.
Twitter users were outraged by how insensitive Byron McDonald was.
Another Twitter user, Sarah Paradis, wrote: 'What a way to go #ByronMacDonald.
You represent CBC and Canada and make us look like a bunch of racists. #disgusted.
Shortly afterwards, Scott Russell, who hosted the CBC show, apologized on air for McDonald's comment, saying, 'We apologize that the swim talk commentary got aired.'
That was a poor choice of words, and we're sorry it happened.'
The SJC ended by apologizing to the more than 90 people who tweeted in response to the statement.
Commentator Scott Russell 's friend had to apologize on behalf of McDonald .
CBC then copied and sent their apology to more than 90 other Twitter users who complained about McDonald's comments.
The network was quick to apologize and release a statement.
We sincerely regret that these statements were made and that they were allowed to air.
Last night, we acted quickly to apologize to our live viewers and our social media followers.
To be clear, Byron's comments were about the swimmer's performance, not her personality.
And yet, it was an inappropriate and unfortunate choice of words, and Byron is very sorry for what he said.
On Thursday afternoon, McDonald apologized on air and attempted to clarify his comment, saying he did not think his words would be construed as an attack on his character.
'I would like to take this moment to apologize for the comment I made last night after the women's relay,' he said on the CBC Olympic Games broadcast.
'I was talking about the performance of the swimmer, not her personally.'
'It goes without saying that no disrespect was intended, and I am very sorry.'
A Primark customer insulted a woman who shamelessly tried on underwear in the middle of the store.
Shoppers didn't know where to look when some woman stripped to try on her panties on the shopping floor in the middle of Primark.
Even worse, she tried on them, took them off and put them back on the shelf.
She continued her search and ended up measuring four pairs of underwear at the Bouverie Place department store in Folkestone.
Primark Bouverie Place in Folkestone, where a woman was trying on knitted panties before putting them back on the shelf
Jenny Davidson, a mother of two who was in the store at the time, said that after trying on her underwear, the mysterious woman "dressed and left the store without buying anything".
She said: "The people could not believe what they were seeing".
Standing in the middle of the mall, she took a pair of panties from the display case, took off her own tights and panties and put them on.
"She didn't try to find a hiding place to do it  she just stood there, shameless".
"Everyone stared when she took off her panties again, "and she clearly didn't like them because she put them back on the shelf".
She did the same thing with three other couples before finally deciding there was nothing in here she liked, got dressed again, and left.
"She didn't seem to care who was watching her, "or if she thought about the person who would end up buying the underwear she was trying on".
Jenny Davidson, 33, from Kent, said: "It's disgusting to think that someone is going to take home underwear that someone else has already worn and that they haven't washed".
The incident happened on Tuesday afternoon.
Davidson added, "I conclude that the staff apparently tried to remove these items of clothing from sale after she left - well, all the better".
"I wouldn't want to come home with a new pair of women's panties "and find that another woman had put them on and off and they hadn't been washed".
A spokesman for Primark said: "Primark is aware of the incident that occurred at our store in Folkestone on Tuesday, August 9th".
All the goods in question have been withdrawn from sale.
How to defend yourself against gun attacks using kraw-manga
The world around you is dangerous, but this video from Dailymail.com might help make it a little safer for you.
We spoke to Ron Mizrachi, a master of the New York City Cow-Maga Federation, to find out how to deal with armed robbers at close range.
Whether you're being approached from the front or the back, this video will show you how to beat a robber with his own weapon.
If approached from behind, Mizrachi says, the first thing to do is to turn around so you can see the attacker and 'release the line of fire'.
Then you squeeze the gun tightly between your forearm and shoulder before you hit them in the face with a free elbow.
Then the knee in the groin, and while the attacker is bending in pain, you twist the gun out of his hands, hit him in the face with the barrel, and walk back, keeping the gun pointed at him.
For an armed, front-line fit, the execution method is similar - remove your body from the line of fire, quickly grab the gun and twist it so that the villain cannot fire.
At the same time, shift the weight onto the gun and punch the attacker in the chest, then twist the gun out of its grip before backing away and aiming at him.
Does that sound complicated?
Watch the video to see exactly how Mizrachi does it.
But remember, the safest way out of any robbery - unless you're a master craw-magician - is to give up your cash.
For a guide , traveller Ian Wright guides his tongue through the dirtiest places in Europe .
A British traveler put his immune system and vomiting reflex to the test by licking some of the dirtiest and most disgusting places in Europe.
Saffolk-based presenter and travel writer Ian Wright, 51, has been spinning on a euro banknote, the railing of the Piccadilly Circus, a toilet seat on a train and a Russian public phone to prove the power of his immune system.
Before licking each object, he used a luminometer to show himself and us what he was getting into.
But the experiment that was to become the movie called "The Lizard Traveler's Guide to the Power Within" has yielded some surprising results.
The thought of licking the wash button on a train that is used by thousands of others may be extremely repulsive, but there are actually worse bacteria in the kitchen sink.
Throughout his trip to Europe, Wright spoke to doctors and medical staff about the increase of intestinal bacteria and his own health.
Fortunately, nothing he licked brought him more than a bad taste in his mouth.
Wright became famous for testing the strength of his intestines, traveling the world and eating strange and amazing things.
From public railway shelters to a toilet flush button, this challenge has certainly tested his immune system.
In a film he made, he said: 'From my childhood I was completely unconcerned about my health and I pulled many different things into my mouth from the ground, eating worms and dirty water.'
He certainly proved his reputation during the movie.
The only thing he refused was a dirty Russian public toilet.
His test smear showed a luminometer reading of over 4,000 units.
For comparison, the hands you just washed should be within the 60 range.
But there was one Russian public toilet that he refused to lick after its light meter read more than 4,000 units, while his freshly washed hands showed less than 60.
Wright and Finnish dairy producer Valio made a traveller film called "The Traveller's Guide to the Liquid of Internal Power", which shows the amount of bacteria in different places, such as the toilet.
In the film, he reported, 'This is close to one of the worst things I've ever smelled in the toilet.'
There's nothing dirtier than that!
I'm not going to lick anything because it's disgusting.
The Traveler's Guide to Inner Power was filmed with Finnish dairy manufacturer Valio.
The company provided Wright with Valio Gefilus, which contains lactic acid bacteria, as well as vitamins C and D, to help speed the growth of human gut bacteria and develop the immune system.
Nico Vuorenmaa, Valio's Senior Vice President for Snacks, Juices and New Categories, said: 'We really wanted to offer consumers something new.
Something that would be interesting to see and could also explain the benefits of probiotics.
We had a brainstorm that ended with, "Let's call Jan".
They say that the interest in gut health is becoming a global phenomenon.
So instead of just talking about food, we wanted to put it in a larger context: the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment, the importance of gut health, and how it relates to the immune system.
The growing interest in gut health is a global phenomenon, and with this documentary, we were able to present more information about this to consumers in an interesting way.
I also think the movie shows that we have a good sense of humor!
Tom Hakala, who directed the film, added: 'Let's put it this way: I would lose respect for Jan if he licked some of the things I asked for, like the disgusting Russian toilet shown in the film.'
Of course, some things were easier for Jan to lick, and some were quite hard.
I'm glad we were able to capture some of that on film.
In a 2015 survey conducted by Valio, 84 percent of respondents associated milk acid bacteria exclusively with good stomach and intestinal health, and 58 percent said they eat at least occasionally products containing added milk acid bacteria.
A family of hooligans destroyed Saltash, the Cornwall town hall, on the eve of the eviction.
A family of hooligans left their municipal home with £50,000 in losses after they were evicted for bullying their neighbours.
Tanya Skeldon and her partner Sean Trebilcock were evicted from their property in Saltash, Cornwall, after a long list of complaints against them.
After they were forcibly evicted from the property, the housing cooperative officials were shocked to find the property in such a state that it needed to be repaired.
The walls were left with gaping holes, the floors were opened, garbage was scattered on the floor and the walls were smeared with graffiti.
The family has now been relocated and is believed to be living in a private apartment.
Donna McEvoy, a tenant at Cornwall Housing, said she was afraid he wouldn't be saved.
She said, 'This has been an absolute nightmare for people here, and I don't think people should live like this.
There are a lot of things to weigh up, because this property is probably going to be known as a not-so-good aspect of Cornwall.
This family has a bad reputation, and their name has a bad reputation.
The couple have three sons who have lived in the property from time to time, and police report that the reign of terror caused by the family included street fights with baseball bats, intimidation of nearby residents, drug use, drug dealing, excessive shouting, arguments and swearing.
Skeldon, 47, whose name was on the lease, was issued a warrant for anti-social behavior in June.
In several rooms of the house, which may be demolished, old trash was found
The floorboards of a former drug house have been pulled out.
Neighbors say they saw street fights and regularly called the police.
Cornwall Housing evicted her and her partner this week after they were given an 11-week extension to voluntarily leave.
The eviction was greeted with relief by neighbors who said their lives had been turned into a living hell.
One reported, 'They were not bothered by anyone.'
We lived next to them for 20 years, and it was always bad.
The number of times we've seen the police here is unbelievable.
'We couldn't sleep this morning.'
We got up because it was so quiet - we're not used to it!
Now that they're finally gone, everything will be fine.
Adam Fitzpatrick, head of the neighbourhood support group Cornwall Housing, said the family had failed to cooperate with local authorities.
The family lived in the house for 20 years, with the police, and they called the police regularly.
Trash and old toys were scattered down the overgrown side of the municipal building.
He added: 'It's a shame that the tenant has failed to accept any responsibility for the behaviour of her and her family, as eviction is always the last resort that Cornwall Housing considers.
This was a very difficult case, as the behaviour was extreme, and their actions must have been appalling to her observing neighbours.
I appreciate all the work that my team, the police and the Devon and Cornwall community have done to bring us this information.
I hope this development will provide some comfort to the neighbors and send a signal that antisocial behavior will not be tolerated.
Fitzpatrick reported that all three sons lived in the house at different times, but said they were all in their 20s at the time.
A dirty mattress left on the floor of one of the bedrooms after the house was evicted.
The resettlement workers will now have to clean up the piles of trash that surround the house.
In 2014, police raided the house and found over 70 grams of cannabis, as well as scales, associated paraphernalia and £1,700 in cash.
Skeldon was fined after pleading guilty to possession with intent to supply class B drugs.
She claimed the money was to pay for a headstone for her son, Lee Skeldon, who died in a car accident in 2013.
After being made homeless, reports are that Tanya and her partner are now living in Plymouth.
The walls of many rooms in the house were covered in graffiti all over the surface.
Police say they'll try to evict tenants who don't abide by the rental rules.
Angela Crowe, from Devon and Cornwall Police, said the eviction sent a clear warning to other tenants who continue to break the rules.
'This is a message to those who feel they can behave without the accusation of the accuser, as well as those who are harmed by such behaviour,' she said.
Criminal and anti-social behaviour will never be tolerated by Devon and Cornwall Police, who will continue to work with partners to protect our communities.
Tourists in Portugal were horrified when a low-flying military plane nearly touched the beach
In Aveiro, Portugal, tourists who enjoy the sun's rays feared for their lives
A P-3C Orion of the Portuguese Air Force was flying incredibly low
The Air Force said it was a training flight, but insisted there was no safety risk.
This is the moment when the frightened tourists start to panic, while the low-flying plane is hovering over a crowded beach.
In dramatic footage, a military plane is seen flying within striking distance of hunters on a sand strip in Aveiro, northern Portugal.
The passengers jumped to their feet as they became understandably concerned by the noise of the aircraft engines, but were unable to see what was coming toward them through the clouds.
The incident happened last night near the town of Aveiro in Costa Nova.
Daniel Fernandez, one of the few vacationers who posted videos of the shocking flight on social media, said: "It flew very low twice, and there was a moment when it seemed at some point that it would break".
Nuno Arroja added: "I was surfing and I swear I had the feeling that a plane was going to fall on me".
Tourists on Aveiro Beach were horrified when the plane appeared from the fog and flew at an extremely low altitude.
The Portuguese Air Force said today that the pilot of the P-3C Orion was on a training flight to spot fishing vessels off the coast and was forced to descend so low as the only way to check them.
The pilot stated that the plane was flying slightly lower than usual due to poor visibility caused by smoke from nearby burning forests, but the air force insisted that no one was in danger.
This summer, forest fires have devastated mainland Portugal and killed four people on the island of Madeira.
The Portuguese Air Force has today announced that the pilot had to fly so low due to circumstances of  thick fog and smog from forest fires, which have reduced visibility
The plane was on a training flight, and the pilot was tasked with finding fishing boats as part of the mission.
The HACCP system has been mandatory for public catering for more than a year, but most cafes and restaurants in St. Petersburg have not yet implemented it.
Checks are becoming more active, and businesses are threatened with fines of up to 1 million rubles.
For more than a year, the Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points (HACCP) system has been mandatory for food manufacturers and transporters, as well as companies in the food industry in Russia, as a member of the Customs Union (CU).
The Rospotrebnadzor's checks of businesses for compliance with these norms in St. Petersburg began in February 2015.
But for now, officials are only writing fines for certain violations of the regulation (see "List of documents"...).
Failure to comply with the regulations will cost the company 600 thousand rubles for the first violation and 1 million rubles for the second.
HACCP was developed in the United States in the 1960s as a system for evaluating and preventing food-related hazards.
It was about food safety for astronauts.
Now it's used in all food businesses, not just in the United States, but in Canada and in the European Union.
Since February 2015, the HASSP has been operating on the territory of the Customs Union.
Businesses had 4 years to develop and implement the system (the HACCP requirement appeared in the technical regulation of the Customs Union in 2011).
However, both businessmen and officials admit that most companies have never heard of the rule.
Unfortunately, we were long convinced that the norm only concerns food production, not restaurants, - explained the head of the Public Council Yelena Tsereteli.
Now everyone's trying to make up for lost time.
The expected date for the resumption of charter flights to Turkey is the end of August - beginning of September.
But they will not be in high demand, since their target audience - families with children - are already getting ready for school, experts say.
The Alliance of Travel Agencies sent a letter to the government yesterday asking for the charter to be allowed now.
"For many Russian tourists, the issue of selecting a quality and affordable sea holiday is an unresolvable one, since most accommodation facilities in the resorts of the Krasnodar Territory and the Republic of Crimea are already booked until the end of September", the authors of the letter note and emphasize that the opening of charter flights in August will not significantly affect the already established demand for the Russian sea tour product.
As reported by the North-West Regional Branch of the Russian Union of the Tourism Industry (RST), if the aviation authorities of Russia and Turkey quickly agree, the resumption of charter flights to Turkey can be expected within a month.
There is no clear understanding of when the charters will be renewed, it depends primarily on the aviation authorities.
Technically, the planes can fly in September, even in August, if the tour operators quickly build programs and agree with the airlines on the necessary flights in the direction", says Pavel Rumyantev, deputy director for communications and international projects of the North-West regional branch of the Russian Broadcasting Corporation.
He said that the possible resumption of charter flights is good news, but it will not affect the market positioning much, because the main buyers of charter tours - families with children - have already returned from their holidays and are preparing for school or are vacationing in other countries.
During the velvet season, the tours are mostly bought by single travellers and couples.
Charter programs can count on those who have the opportunity to relax spontaneously", says Pavel Rumyansev.
"Turkey has a chance to attract a lot of tourists if it gives very low-cost offers now - 50-60 thousand rubles for a tour for two, because there are people who are intentionally waiting for very cheap tours", says Valeria Rosenthal, general director of the travel agency Optio-Travel.
Otherwise, you can't count on a rush, because most of the travel is already planned.
Pavel Rumyantsev also believes that since there is a demand for regular flights to Turkey, charters will also be in demand, but there is no need to wait for a frenzy.
"For Turkey, the launch of charters now is a rehearsal for the next season", says Pavel Rumyantsev.
"The opening of charters to Turkey is positive news for the next season", - agrees Valeria Rubtsova.
The tax code provides for exemption from the NPLF of compensation payments established by law within the limits of approved norms related to the compensation of damage caused by mutilation or other damage to health.
The provision of milk to workers engaged in work with harmful working conditions is provided for in Art. 222 of the Trade Code of the Russian Federation.
At the same time, the norms and conditions of issuance are established by the order of the Ministry of Health and Social Development of Russia of 16.02.2009 No 45n.
According to this document, free milk or other equivalent food products are given to employees on days of actual employment in jobs with harmful working conditions due to the presence of harmful production factors at the workplace.
Based on these norms, the Federal Tax Service of Russia in the letter under consideration came to the conclusion that on the basis of the 2nd paragraph of the 3rd paragraph of the article 217 of the RF Tax Code, income in the form of the value of milk, issued to employees during the days of actual employment in work with harmful working conditions, is exempt from taxation of the NDFL in accordance with the Norms and conditions approved by the order of the Ministry of Health and Social Development of Russia of 16.02.2009 No. 45n.
Moscow's Gazstroybank has lost its license from the Central Bank.
On Friday, August 12, 2016, the Central Bank of Russia revoked the license for carrying out banking operations from the credit organization "GASSTROYBANK" Joint Stock Commercial Bank, registered in Moscow.
According to the regulator, JSC "GASSTROYBANK" conducted a high-risk credit policy related to the placement of funds in low-quality assets.
The adequate assessment of the risks taken by the supervisory authority and the reliable reflection of the value of the bank's assets led to the emergence of the credit institution's grounds for implementing measures to prevent bankruptcy.
In addition, the credit institution was involved in carrying out dubious transit operations.
The bank has been appointed as a temporary administration for the period of time until the appointment of a tender manager or liquidator.
The powers of the executive bodies of the credit organization are suspended in accordance with federal laws.
GAZSTROYBANK is a member of the deposit insurance system.
We remind that the payment of insurance compensation to depositors of the bank, including individual entrepreneurs, in accordance with the Federal Law No. 177-FZ "On insurance of deposits of individuals in banks of the Russian Federation" is provided in the amount of 100% of the balance of funds, but not more than 1.4 million rubles in total for one depositor.
The payout, according to the Deposit Insurance Agency, will begin no later than August 26, 2016.
According to the reporting data, by the value of assets, GAZSTROYBANK JSC on August 1, 2016 took the 335th place in the banking system of the Russian Federation.
A London schoolgirl who joined ISIS has been killed in Syria
Kadeesa Sultan, one of three British schoolgirls who left London last year to join ISIS, has reportedly been killed in Syria.
Her lawyer, Tasneem Akunji, said her family learned of her death in Raqqa, Syria, a few weeks ago.
She is believed to have been killed in a Russian airstrike in Raqqa, the group's stronghold in the country, ITV News reported on Thursday.
The Sultan was 17 years old, and according to her family, she was killed just as she was planning to leave the war-torn country and return to England.
"One can only hope that the only benefit of all this - as a memorial and a testament to others that these are the risks that are involved in travelling to a war zone - is to dissuade people from ever making the same choice", Akundji said.
In February 2015, Sultana and two other schoolgirls from east London boarded a plane to Turkey and then a bus to the Syrian border.
The Sultan's family was told that she married an ISIS fighter in Syria and was widowed within months.
Reid says Clinton will remain loyal to Garland as a candidate for Chief Justice if elected.
Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid says he's convinced Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton will nominate Justice Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court if she is elected president.
Senate Republicans blocked Garland's confirmation, the same way President Barack Obama nominated him in March.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell says the next president will pick the man who can replace the late Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia.
Reid said on a conference call Thursday that he predicts Clinton will pick Harland "with some degree of confidence".
Representative Reid later said he didn't speak to Clinton directly about whether she would nominate Garland, and was just speculating.
He praised Garland and said the Clinton team wouldn't want to rock the boat with a new choice.
Garland is the Chief Judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.
Reid said the Republicans who are blocking Garland's nomination are "supporters" and "partisans" of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump.
He said Trump was unfit for the job.
Treats states that erotic calendars are for 'women as well as for men'
Treats magazine is collaborating with photographer David Bellmer to release a 2017 calendar inspired by the 1970s Pirelli.
But instead of naked celebrities, they're looking to find the next generation of top models for their 2017 calendar of nude muse.
Treats president Steve Shaw told us earlier this year that his magazine, with its many nude models, is different from the old-fashioned Playboy because "Playboy is for men".
I make it for women.
Obviously, he thinks the calendar is, too.
"We need to return to the display of the timeless and classic nude figure, where women, as well as men, feel comfortable and inspired by these images of the female body", said Shaw in a press release announcing the calendar.
Women will want to be part of this project because it's a beautiful piece of art.
Models can submit photos online or in person at open castings in Los Angeles and New York.
The Muscovites will be handed out a memento about unscrupulous online shops.
Moscow is going to release a pamphlet that will tell you how not to become a victim of an online store.
This was reported in the Rospotrebnadzor, writes M24.
It is reported that the department's specialists are preparing a booklet that will help citizens to choose the right online store and recognize possible fraud schemes.
The concept of this brochure is divided into several sections.
It's going to be the general information and the legal framework, the rules for delivering goods, the ways to protect your legal rights.
The application will give recommendations on how to properly compose a claim and so on", - told in Rospotrebnadzor.
The memoir is currently being finalized.
It will subsequently be placed on the website of Rospostrenazors in Moscow, and it is also planned to publish a printed version and distribute it to Moscow residents.
The Russian Foreign Ministry released a statement naming a second suspect in the Crimea's sabotage.
People from among the citizens of Ukraine and Russia who assisted in the preparation of terrorist acts were detained.
Among them are Panov Evgeny Alexandrovich and Zakhtey Andrei Romanovich.
"They all gave confession", the report says.
Earlier, Zaporizhia resident Yevgeny Panov, who was detained on suspicion of organizing terrorist attacks in Crimea, admitted his guilt during interrogation.
The FAS is going to fine Google 438 million rubles.
The Federal Antimonopoly Service of Russia (FAS) has imposed an administrative fine on Google in the amount of 438 million rubles, according to the agency's website.
"The fine for Google for violating the antitrust legislation was 438 million rubles.
We hope that the company will comply with our decision and pay the fine in the near future", - said the deputy head of the FAS Alexey Dotenko.
During the investigation, the FAS established that Google supplies manufacturers of smartphones that are sold in Russia, the Google Play app store only on the condition that other applications of the corporation will be installed on the device.
Among these applications is a search engine, which should be placed on the main screen of the smartphone.
Thus, the corporation violates part 1 of article 10 of the Federal Law "On the protection of competition" (abuse of a dominant position).
We are confident that the execution of the injunction will provide an opportunity for the development of competition in the mobile software market in Russia, which will have a positive impact on our consumers.
The law "On the protection of competition" should be observed by all companies whose products are supplied to the territory of the Russian Federation, including transnational corporations", - said the head of the Administration of regulation of communication and information technologies of the FAS of Russia, Elena Zaeva.
The bureau suspects 16 Russian stores in the conspiracy.
The New Bookstore chain was fined for selling the book "50 Days Before I Die".
The New Bookstore chain has been fined for selling Stace Kramer's book "50 Days Before My Suicide", Moscow City News Agency reports.
As reported in Rospotrebnadzor, without specifying the amount of the fine, the text of the book can be considered as "provocative or motivating to suicidal behavior of children and adolescents".
The Ostanka district court confirmed the violation of the established requirements for the distribution of information products among children and decided to impose a fine and confiscation of 49 copies of printed products arrested by the Rosspotrebnadzor.
A source at the New Book Club confirmed that it was a book by Stace Kramer.
In March of this year, it was reported that the book "50 Days Before I Suicide" was being checked in Moscow's largest bookstores.
In Moscow, there will be a night to remember Ernst the Unknown.
Moscow will host a memorial service for the sculptor Ernst Neznany, TASS reports.
The event will be held on August 15 in the Central House of Literature.
Unfortunately, not everyone will be able to say goodbye to John Doe in the U.S. in person.
Therefore, it was decided to arrange this evening for those who want to remember him in their native land", - said in the press service of the Russian Jewish Congress.
It said it was important to the widow of the sculptor, Anna Graham, and to his friends around the world.
The evening was attended by close friends of the Unknown, including the poet Yevgeny Yevtushenko, the artist Boris Messerer, the president of the Pushkin State Museum of Art Irina Antonova, the director Mark Rozovsky, as well as the Minister of Culture of Russia Vladimir Medinsky, the head of the Moscow Department of Culture Alexander Kibovsky, the deputy mayor of Moscow Leonid Pechatnikov.
Earlier it was reported that relatives of Ernst Unknown are planning to hold a funeral for the sculptor in New York, presumably before August 14.
The end consumer of the vinyl: who actually buys the records?
Lonely middle-aged men like vinyl.
And unless you're going to flood the comments section with crude insults under the alias Not All Single Men Average, this claim is based on actual data.
According to YouGov, the much-discussed revival of the record isn't due to a boom among millennials who want to feel the novelty of a material object, but to a nostalgia for the middle ages.
The most recent vinyl album buyers are likely to be between the ages of 45 and 54, according to the data.
In fact, those in the 18 to 24 age group are least likely to be affected.
It's also not just an act of getting together with lovers - it has emotional meaning: older vinyl buyers are slightly more likely to keep their feelings to themselves (56% vs. 53%) and enjoy being alone (69% vs. 66%).
But are the YouGov results accurate?
If this blog was a TV news report, the camera would follow me as I walk down the center of a busy Soho street, in a modest gray suit, and make a wild gesture before a stop, folding my hands and saying something inspiring like, "Well, let's see".
Let's see.
While the heart of Soho is slowly losing its charm and mud  hotels, cafes, Paperchase stores now overrun the buildings once occupied by independent retailers  a few music shops with fantastic specialists are still left.
I would probably ask the camera to stop for the next scene, where I'm getting close to different people in some of these stores and trying to assess their age and emotional state through observation.
Glasgow Stuart, 55, whom I followed from Sister Ray (data count: two young women, three middle-aged men) to Reckless Records (data count: eight middle-aged men, one woman, probably over 20), in London for half a day to make an appointment, and strolling through the shops to take a few hours.
Is he a collector, I ask?
"I suppose so", he says.
I have about 3,000 or 4,000 plates.
These plates, pictured above (he e-mailed me the pictures, I didn't follow him home), line the walls of his living room.
His reason for acquiring such a huge number of albums and singles is partly due to his disposable income: he can now buy records that he couldn't afford when they first came out, and redeem items that he sold when he was young and broke.
"A lot of the stuff I buy is late '60s, early '70s stuff, stuff that came out when I was 11 or 12, stuff that I was probably too young to buy", he says.
He agrees that those who buy records are more likely to be introverts who enjoy their own company, adding: "I don't smoke, I don't drink very much.
That's my weakness.
Wes, 25, who works at Sister Ray, also believes that many of the clients he meets fit the YouGov profile.
He, however, noticed a new wave of people influenced by the media hype, people who heard about the comeback and felt obligated to buy their old records.
From the conversations I've had, people have disposed of their collection, usually around 1998 or 1999.
Customers who once sold their vinyl to buy CDs now sell their CDs to buy their records", he says.
This may explain the boom among the vinyl revivalists of a certain age.
What about the alleged emotional significance of the plates?
It only takes a few seconds in a store like Phonica to realize that record stores offer a comfortable community of like-minded people.
According to Ues, some of the older customers in particular are offended by the cashless payment system.
Some vinyl lovers may feel the shock of the digital world and prefer to retreat into the permanence of familiar vinyl envelopes, items that evoke memories of a carefree youth.
"I think sometimes it can be filling a void or having material things as a kind of comfort", says Wes.
As a collector myself, I have it, and I think a lot of people have it, too.
It's a simple way to occupy your head.
"We're like their social workers!" said a colleague from the record rack.
An ICM poll in April showed that almost 50% of people who bought a vinyl album last month had not yet heard it.
The survey also found that 41% of those who buy vinyl have a player they never use, while 7% of those who buy vinyl do not have a record player.
At this point in the news report, I would probably look seriously confused, leafing through a shelf of Bosanov's collections.
The "trophy" aspect of the revival is what 42-year-old Johnny, who works at Sounds of the Universe, noticed.
"Someone came to me recently and said, 'I don't have a record player, but I want to buy a Radiohead record so we can put it on our shelf,'" he says.
It's not a big percentage, but it definitely happens.
More of the same, less of the same.
We have people who say, "I don't have a record player".
They're younger people, not older people, just a little bit under the age of 20, who are just getting to know it.
Fopp, who's now taken over most of the vinyl floor, has a much more diverse audience when I come in.
There are couples in their 70s, tourists who take pictures, teenage boys and middle-aged women.
Although the atmosphere is less casual than in the aforementioned stores, the latest synth and sexy pop of Wild Beast, rather than jazz improvisation, is breaking through the columns. It's nice to see the diversity in your customers.
None of them look particularly lonely, but it's hard to identify a painful psychological trauma after standing next to someone for 30 seconds.
Eleanor, 27, walked around Fopp for a few minutes, looking at the various records on sale.
She looks at the goods, not spending money.
She doesn't make much, she says, so collecting records isn't really a good idea.
It's expensive.
Listening to music on a computer or any other device is easy, but the beauty of vinyl is"... she plunges into her dreams with a sigh, filled with love.
I don't know how to explain it. It's really unique.
My final stop is a store that is said to have helped to birth a new generation of vinyl enthusiasts: the Urban Fads.
As I create the illusion that I'm looking at jeans wearing shorts, I'm watching a group of teenage girls gather around a Polaroid camera every minute before a father and his daughter start discussing the purchase of a Crosley recorder.
On the left is the staircase, the wall of which is lined with records by Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mix of modern style and classics, a must-have for any mid-sized record collection.
No one looks - perhaps because they are just a decoration, some are so high on the wall that it would be impossible to touch them.
This is a real "art vinyl".
But given that any attention to these items could mean more money for the industry and send a few clients back to the Soho area for a while, there's almost nothing to complain about.
It's no surprise that the population that is more likely than the majority to have more time and more money than the majority is the population that spends the most money on luxury items like vinyl.
But while my findings suggest that YouGov's results are accurate, at least in Soho record stores, they don't rule out the existence of a huge number of female collectors and vinyl lovers who exist in the real world, in record stores and online forums.
These people are probably working in schools or offices.
But they certainly don't spend Thursday mornings wandering the record shops on Berwick Street, squeezing out records and avoiding the unpleasant gaze of a 30-year-old fake host who hovers over the shoulders of unsuspecting middle-aged men.
Greenland polar shark  the longest living vertebrate  video report
Scientists claim that the Greenland shark has the longest life span of any vertebrate on the planet.
Julius Nielsen, who studies these sharks, claims that the record was set by a female between 272 and 512 years old and five meters long
French court rejects proposed demolition of shops in Jungle refugee camp
A French court has rejected a proposal by the Calais authorities to demolish dozens of makeshift shops and restaurants in the Jungle camp, where thousands of refugees live.
At a court hearing this week, the Kale authorities argued that the state should be able to demolish a total of 72 homemade shops where people inside the camp sell everything from cigarettes to energy drinks, offer haircuts or sell tea for 50 cents or simple dishes for a few euros in homemade restaurants.
The Kale prefecture has argued that these places should be demolished because they represent a parallel economy that does not pay taxes, and because they carry fire and sanitary risks.
Humanitarian groups told the court that shops and restaurants were vital, saying that free meals offered by the pro-government association and other groups did not provide enough food for the growing number of people in the camp.
They said that home-made shops and restaurants often provide shelter and free food to those in need.
The Lille court ruled that there was no legal basis to evict the people who ran the 72 artisan shops, but stated that the Calais prefecture's problems "were fully understood".
Judge Jean-François Moll said that grocery stores, cafes and restaurants played a much larger role than simply feeding people who "live in extremely precarious conditions".
He said that the spaces provided a quiet meeting point for refugees and volunteers.
One of the sites that was threatened with demolition was the children's cafe, The Jungle Book at the camp, which is a non-profit that offers 200 meals a day, English and French classes, and shelter counseling for hundreds of vulnerable unaccompanied minors at the camp.
Over 170,000 people have signed a petition to protect the children's cafe.
A letter sent to the Guardian said that its closure "would be catastrophic for these children, some as young as eight".
Two charities, Refugee Aid and L'Auberge des Migrants estimated on Friday that the number of people in the Jungle camp had risen to over 9,000 - the highest ever - after a sharp increase in new arrivals during the summer.
The district libraries invite young freedmen to participate in educational programs.
This week, the branch libraries will hold meetings dedicated to City Day, the Year of Russian Cinema and even the Day of the Physical Educationist.
The programmes are geared towards a children's audience, so most of them will be in the form of games.
Today, August 10th, the library branch No. 2 in the bay area invites you to the "My little town" cruise presentation.

Britain settle for silver in rugby 7 after Fiji's masters let them take gold
Britain's impressive Rugby 7s run was crushed at the final hurdle by the Fiji team in the final on Thursday night, when they were utterly beaten 43-7 at the Deodoro Stadium here in Rio.
Fiji mastered ball control, spread, evasion, support, line running and brute force to win gold  their first Olympic medal of any colour.
The defeat came with a not-so-poor consolation in the form of silver - Britain's third in a day - and they could have been proud of their efforts in the first Rugby 7's Olympic tournament, beating New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa along the way.
The Boks' painful beating, 7-5 in the semi-final earlier in the day, could return to take a toll on them in the final.
But despite all that, Fiji in that uniform beat a team of 15 best.
It may be some consolation for the UK  but it probably isn't  that at least one Briton will be hanging a gold medal around his neck tomorrow: Fiji's head coach Ben Ryan, former England Wimbledon chef.
It was some kind of journey for Britain.
Eight years ago, under Ryan, they lost every game to the Adelaide Sevens.
They only lost one here.
These blows will hurt, but the progress is amazing.
Fiji started great, just for fun, beating off a British attempt to intercept the ball.
It was like running into a column of moving buses for Captain Tom Mitchell and company, and the World Series champions were up 5-0 when Osei Collinsau dived into the corner.
With four minutes left on the clock, Jerriir Tuway added another right-handed touchdown that was scored.
12-0 and Great Britain barely touched the ball.
A great interception by Mitchell kept mountain man Leon Nakarava from scoring a third, but it only delayed Fiji.
In the seventh minute, Jasa Veremalua scored a touchdown in the right corner, and Great Britain lost 17-0.
Nakarava added another one after the reset and the clock still had over a minute... in the first half.
Watemo Ravowo then broke through several more sluggish attempts to intercept the UK and stormed the line to take the point.
The execution led to a 29-0 at the break.
It looked as if Fiji was born to play rugby 7, while Britain still mastered the craft.
Which, to a large extent, it is.
The British made massive half-time substitutions, and they blocked the Fijian gap... for all four minutes, which by the standards of the first half was good, until Joshua Tuisova came through after some brilliant Fijian interactions.
Dan Norton grabbed a try for Great Britain, scoring a touchdown in the left corner to make it 36-7, but the game had long been the South Sea Islanders' way, with their fans singing, waving flags and dancing on the stands.
It was impossible not to admire the joy of Fiji's approach.
Mata William has embellished the Fiji cake, which didn't need to be embellished, with another attempt in the last seconds.
The whistle was blown, the Fijians embraced, and Britain fell on the lawn, completely defeated.
Earlier in the day, Fiji beat Japan 20-5 in their semi-final, and the UK narrowly beat South Africa in a tense semi-final by one try each.
Kyle Brown leads the Boks in the first half, but Dan Norton, with some great footwork, breaks the line and hits the ball under the beams in the second half.
A brilliant last attempt to intercept from Marcus Watson, the brother of England's 15-a-side Anthony, secured the victory and ultimately the silver medal.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning inspired to win in rowing by a coach battling cancer .
There's no more exciting gold at these games, and that says something.
From first move to last, 220 heavy lifts into history, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found added value in their golden moment at the Estacio da Lagoa.
Although they were the two who pulled the oars, there were three voices in this boat, the echo of coach Robin Williams was always there as they sought their second Olympic gold in a row in the women's pairs, the first women in the annals of British sport to have reached that height.
Their superiority was absolute, after all it was their 39th undefeated performance, again unprecedented.
What we see, two brilliant athletes, gliding across the surface with the elegance of swans, does not fully reflect the nature of triumph.
Behind every gold was a battalion of ready hands, contributing to the gradual buildup of victories that mattered, and no hands were more important than the hands of a coach who, 30 months ago, when he was diagnosed with cancer, didn't know if he would live to see that day.
Like he said, it was a dangerous job.
I had bladder cancer, which is one of the things they can operate on, and they did it.
If they don't, he goes everywhere.
It could have been a pretty bad situation.
It changes your outlook a little bit.
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.
The trio were lucky to be able to start treatment in early 2014 in the offseason, keeping the schedule gap minimal, if that can be the right word in circumstances like this.
I needed the money, so I needed to get better quickly.
It was a stimulus.
I was in the hospital and I was walking around the ward -- 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet at a time, even though they said it was enough to take a few steps.
That's how it starts.
Rowing is a journey in itself, but it makes it a little bit more.
The next moment after the victory, their first thoughts were of Williams, who had spent a nervous morning talking a little more than usual in an attempt to get over his own anxiety.
Stanning, a captain in the field artillery regiment who served in Afghanistan, said, "I've been emotionally devastated this week, and maybe it's a little bit too much, but it means so much".
It just goes to show how much this means to me, how much Helen and I have worked, and Robin has worked.
It was a fantastic three years with Helen and Robin.
Without Robin, we'd be nothing, so thank him, he's the best coach in the world.
I couldn't ask for a better training partner or a better coach.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning have not lost a race in five years.
This pair sets a tense pace that their competitors have never been able to match.
Even in the last 500 metres, when the New Zealand and Denmark teams started to close in, Stanning and Glover had too much in reserve.
We were very high.
Helen was like, "keep in the loop, keep in the loop".
It's very important not to get carried away.
We had a good start, and at the same time we weren't trying to do something awesome.
We weren't expecting fireworks today, we were just expecting to be able to row well and go out and win this race, which we did.
It's going to take a couple of years to decide their future.
Glover needs to be at the wedding next month, her own with TV adventurer Steve Backshall.
She just wants to enjoy the moment.
I didn't mean to say it was my last race.
That would mean too much pressure.
It took me about six months in London to realize that I was an Olympic champion.
It was all so new, and I was so tense.
It took about four minutes.
I feel so much better", she said.
Government extends period of destruction of sanctioned products
The government has extended until the end of 2017 the period for destroying food products banned for import into Russia.
The relevant decree was signed by Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev and published on the official legal information portal.
The embargo against countries that imposed anti-Russian sanctions due to the situation in Ukraine was introduced in our country in August 2014.
The ban has been extended several times, and it now runs until December 31, 2017.
Russia is banned from importing certain agricultural products, raw materials and foodstuffs from the USA, EU countries, Canada, Australia, Norway, Ukraine, Albania, Montenegro, Iceland and Liechtenstein.
In particular, meat and meat products, fish, seafood, vegetables, fruits and dairy products were banned.
The disposal of food imported into the country bypassing the embargo has been carried out in Russia since August 2015.
In the first quarter of 2016 alone, about 100 tons of prohibited products were withdrawn from sale.
The hunt for the "forbidden"
It's supposed to rain and thunder in Moscow on Friday.
An atmospheric front will pass through the metropolitan region, bringing rain and lowering air temperatures.
The air gets up to 25 degrees in the daytime.
So, on Saturday night in Moscow, there will be short-term rain, thunderstorms and gusts of wind up to 15 m/s.
Rain is expected in the afternoon with thunderstorms and gusts of wind up to 12-17 m/s.
Rains with thunderstorms are also forecast in the Orel, Kursk and Voronezh regions, reports "Dni.ru".
Next week's rain is unlikely.
The WTO panel of arbitrators found that Russian import duties on paper, refrigerators and palm oil were against WTO rules.
The import rates are higher than the commitments Russia made when it joined the WTO.
"This is the first time that the WTO has taken a decision against the Russian Federation", the organization's official website said.
However, the arbitrators stressed in their conclusion that the EU had not provided sufficient evidence that Russia's measures "were systematic" or "comprehensive".
Russia, in turn, has promised to adjust import duties on paper and refrigerators in the near future.
This is stated in the report of the Ministry of Economic Development of Russia.
On July 4, it was reported that Kiev intends to complain to the World Trade Organization about Russia's actions in imposing additional restrictions on the transit of Ukrainian goods.
This is stated in a statement of the government of Ukraine.
In May, the Financial Times wrote that the US's behavior in resolving disputes in the WTO undermines the organization's established principles of discussion.
Brazil, Japan, the European Union and other WTO members made similar statements after the US refused to confirm South Korean judge Chan Son Hwa for a second term.
In this regard, Russia will not appeal to the WTO on the issue of Western sanctions imposed against the Russian Federation.
The WTO is an international organization established in January 1995 to liberalize international trade.
Today, it has 162 member countries.
Russia joined in 2012.
The president 's administration has a new leader .
Russian President Vladimir Putin has appointed Anton Vaino, former deputy of Sergei Ivanov, as head of his own administration.
Vladimir Putin made changes in the presidential administration and expressed hope that the new head of his administration would contribute to the constructive work of the government and the Kremlin.
In turn, Anton Vaino during the meeting said that he considers important the anti-corruption work, which he began to carry out as head of the administration of President Ivanov, and promised to cooperate with the government.
Earlier, Izvestia wrote that experts consider the situation with the resignation of Sergei Ivanov from the post of head of the administration transparent and understandable and the change will not change anything in the activity of the Kremlin administration.
They point out that the head who worked in the presidential administration for a long time, effectively built the AP's activities, left.
He was replaced by Anton Waino, the deputy head of administration, a man who knows the specifics of this job.
In Poland, they assume that they will not buy fuel from Gazprom.
Polish state oil and gas company PGNIG does not rule out that after a few years, gas supplies from Russia may become unattractive for it due to reorientation to fuel from Norway and other countries.
This was reported by the vice-president of the Polish company for finance, Boguesław Majec.
TASS reports his words.
"We may not be buying gas (from Gazprom) at all, we are diversifying our supplies now.
Within the next four years, the main supply routes for us will be the East, raw materials from LNG terminals and Norway", said Majec.
Currently, Gazprom holds a dominant position in gas supplies to Poland.
On Friday, August 12, PGNIG reported that the Russian supplier delivered nearly 5.3 billion cubic meters of gas in the first half of 2016, up 30 percent from 2015.
The Russian gas giant's share of PGNIG's purchases rose to 49.8% from 40% a year earlier.
Recall that on July 22, the Polish anti-monopoly agency did not agree to the creation of a joint venture of Gazprom and its European partners for the construction of the Nord Stream-2 gas pipeline.
A month earlier, Poland had left Gazprom with a request for 11 billion cubic meters of gas from the Nord Stream 2 pipeline.
This was stated by the deputy chairman of the board of the holding Alexander Medvedev.
The auction for the capacity of "Nord Stream-2" will be held in 2017, and in the autumn of 2016 it is planned to hold an auction for its laying.
In late May, Gazprom was reported as not planning to take any action yet in connection with the Polish side's intention to abandon long-term contracts for gas supplies from Russia after 2022, said the company's deputy chairman Alexander Medvedev.
He recalled that in the first quarter of this year, the Poles increased gas purchases from Russia by only 42%.
The deputy chairman of Gazprom added that the very fact of the Polish PGNIG filing a petition to the Stockholm Arbitration Court does not mean that the negotiations have stopped.
Earlier, a Polish company had filed a lawsuit to lower the purchase price of Russian gas.
The Polish government's representative for gas and energy infrastructure, Petr Naimski, said that the Polish authorities had decided not to renew the contract with Gazprom for gas supply.
Poland's contract with Gazprom was signed in 1996 and expires in 2022.
In March, the Polish government's representative for gas and energy infrastructure, Peter Naimsky, said that his country could abandon blue fuel supplies from the east in six years.
According to him, Warsaw plans to build a new liquefied natural gas supply terminal Baltic Pipe, which will connect the country with the Norwegian shelf.
Nord Stream 2 envisages the construction of two lines of a marine gas pipeline with a combined capacity of 55 billion cubic meters of gas per year from Russia to Germany along the bottom of the Baltic Sea.
The OSCE Special Monitoring Mission (SMM) has increased the number of observers near the Ukrainian-Crimean border.
This was reported by the first deputy head of the SMM in Ukraine, Alexander Hug.
"I can confirm that the SMM has increased the number of observers in this area", he said, responding to a question from journalists, RIA Novosti reports.
According to the OSCE, the situation on the border of Ukraine and Crimea is calm, there are no incidents affecting security.
The monitors monitored three checkpoints across the Russian-Ukrainian border.
A video of a Yak-42 passenger plane landing at the Ufa airport has surged 400 meters beyond the runway and crashed into the left wing.
The video was released by the "360" TV channel.
The accident happened at 4.30 Moscow time.
The KrasAvia flight from Sochi has arrived.
They were quickly evacuated to safety, no casualties.
The aircraft itself was transported to the parking lot.
The airport of Ufa is operating normally.
The Volga Investigative Directorate on the transport of the SCR has begun to clarify the reason for the hard landing of the plane.
The UN is investigating the use of chemical weapons in Syria.
A UN special commission is investigating the possible use of toxic gas in rebel-held areas of the Syrian city of Aleppo.
All sides in the conflict deny the use of chlorine, but the UN special envoy for Syria, Stephane de Mistura, considers the incident to be indisputable.
The remarks came on the eve of the third round of inter-Syrian talks, which are due to begin in Geneva at the end of August.
UN experts have launched an investigation into reports of chemical weapons being used in the Syrian city of Aleppo.
The first report of a terrorist attack using toxic gas, presumably chlorine, came on August 2.
The opposition then claimed that the Russian military transport helicopter had been shot down in the area, and that the aviation had dropped bombs with a poisonous substance, but Moscow called these accusations a "slap".
Later, the Russian Ministry of Defense blamed the opposition group "Harakyat Nur ad-Din az-Zinki" for the incident.
It was soon learned that there were two bombs filled with toxic gas.
This was confirmed by one of the victims to the BBC.
"After a few minutes, I smelled gas, my eyes began to burn, and I found it difficult to breathe", the newspaper quoted an eyewitness as saying.
At least seven people were killed and 23 were hospitalized.
If the use of poison gas is confirmed by the experts, the actions will be considered a war crime.
Staffan de Mistura, the UN special envoy for Syria, told reporters: "There is a lot of evidence that this really happened".
The use of chlorine for military purposes is prohibited by the Chemical Weapons Convention .
Despite the fact that all sides in the Syrian conflict deny the use of toxic gases, in 2015 human rights activists recorded 35 cases of chlorine use by the Syrian army against the "moderate opposition".
The situation in Aleppo is complicated by the fact that the areas of Aleppo are shelled daily, and the terrorists are preventing the evacuation of residents from the city.
Reuters reports that the UN is waiting for Russia to establish a "humanitarian pause" in the military action.
The current three-hour daily silence is "insufficient to help the nearly 2 million civilians trapped".
Jan Egellan, adviser to Staffan de Mistura on humanitarian issues, said that it would take a 48-hour ceasefire every week to get aid to the city and to evacuate the sick and wounded.
"We have to send bulk cargoes from a column of trucks in the area, where the roads are almost destroyed, and those that remain are mined", Mr. Egélanne said. "But the Russian delegation has confirmed its readiness to sit down with us at the negotiating table".
Consultations in Geneva between representatives of the US and Russia on establishing a "humanitarian pause" are continuing.
How Russia opened a "humanitarian window" in Aleppo.
As the battle for Aleppo, Syria's second largest city, continues, Russia announced a three-hour ceasefire on August 11, which will be in effect daily starting Thursday.
The creation of "humanitarian windows" is intended to provide conditions for the delivery of medicines, food and essential items to the city.
The decision of the Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation was taken against the background of increasing international pressure on Moscow with the demand to stop the military operation and to contribute to the resumption of the negotiation process.
A series of bombings at Thai resorts has killed four people.
A series of explosions rocked southern Thailand on Friday morning.
The attack killed four people and injured 19.
The epicenter of the explosions was in Hua Hin.
Among the victims were ten foreigners, citizens of four states, no Russians among them.
No terrorist group has claimed responsibility for the incident, but the country's Interior Ministry hastened to say that Islamists were not involved.
Several suspects have been arrested for the bombings.
According to preliminary information from the local police, the scale and nature of the explosions suggest that they were aimed at the country's military leadership.
The attacks took place at popular tourist resorts, including Patong Beach in Phuket and the cities of Hua Hin, Trang and Surat Thani.
After the military junta came to power in the country in 2014, economic growth fell from 7.2% in 2012 to 2.8% in 2015, but tourism remained one of the few industries that showed growth.
In 2016, 14 million people visited the country, 1.5 million more than in 2015.
The first suspects in the preparation and organization of the attacks have already been arrested, police colonel Krisana Patanacharoen reported.
He added that it was too early to talk about the targets, but the country's interior ministry "is confident that they are not linked to international extremist groups".
It's too early to draw conclusions, Mr. Patanacharyen said.
But we know for sure that these incidents are not directly related to any kind of terrorism, they are in fact local diversions, and we're trying to identify who was behind them.
The blasts occurred on the birthday of Thailand's Queen Sikrit.
The Thai junta considers protecting the monarchy to be one of its top priorities, so the incident is likely aimed against it.
According to police general Sithikchya Shriopacharoenrat, the bombs were detonated remotely with a half-hour difference.
They were hidden in trees on busy streets filled with tourists dining in restaurants.
It is already known that one of the four dead was a Thai girl who sold street food.
The identities of the other victims are unknown, but they are known to be residents of four foreign countries.
According to the Royal Thai Police, among them are four German citizens, three Dutch nationals, two Italian nationals and an Austrian citizen.
There are no Russians among the victims of the explosions, the press service of the Rosturizm reported.
Local experts also link the blasts to the August 7 referendum, in which 61.4% of the country's population supported the draft of a new constitution.
It was prepared by a constitutional commission appointed by the military junta.
Voters had to decide whether they supported a system where the upper house of parliament is entirely appointed by the military and has a significant role in the election of the country's prime minister.
The new system has been adopted and will be tested for the first time in the 2017 parliamentary elections.
On May 22, 2014, a military coup was carried out in Thailand by the country's army commander, Prayut Chan-o-cha.
The move, he said, was prompted by the ongoing political crisis and lack of progress in talks between the government and the opposition.
The military created the National Council for Peace and Order, imposed curfews and censorship, and dispersed the protesters and the upper house of parliament.
How Bangkok came to be in a state of emergency
The Thai government, led by Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra, declared a state of emergency in Bangkok and the provinces surrounding the capital in January 2014.
The special regime lasted 60 days.
Like the two bombs in Bangkok.
In January 2014, two explosions occurred at the Victory Monument in central Bangkok, where one of the main protests was taking place, injuring 28 people, five of them critically ill.
The explosions were made by unknown motorists.
Authorities have stepped up security measures in the capital and deployed military forces to protect the demonstrators.
The Dry Bough has begun to develop conditions.
As it became known to "Kommersant", the government was asked to agree on the draft terms of the auction for the gold ore deposit of Dry Log, with the preservation of two key restrictions.
It is proposed that companies with 25% or more foreign ownership and those applicants whose capital will not have at least 25% of the state share will not be allowed to enter the auction.
Industry players are not expecting the government to rewrite the terms, noting that many players are not taking the risk of undertaking a complex and expensive project.
They could announce the auction in August, and hold it in October.
The Ministry of Natural Resources has submitted to the government a draft order and conditions for the auction of the largest undeveloped gold mine in Russia, Sukhoi Log (Irkutsk region, reserves and resources - 130 million ounces), two sources familiar with the situation told "Ъ".
The bill was filed Wednesday night, one of them said.
The Ministry of Natural Resources confirmed to Kommersant that the project has been submitted to the government.
The representative of the vice-premier Alexander Khloponin, who is in charge of the underground, told "Kommersant" that the project has not yet been submitted to the official's office.
"The auction could be announced as early as August, immediately after the government's order, and with a deadline of at least 45 days for potential bidders, the tender could be held as early as October", the Ministry of Natural Resources said.
According to "Ъ", the project preserved two key requirements for potential participants, written in the version that was sent for approval to the ministries and the FOIV in July (there is "Ъ").
The first is that the applicants must have at least 25% of the state's share in the capital.
The second is the denial of access to the auction for companies controlled by foreign investors, based on the FZ-57 understanding of foreign investment in strategic companies.
According to two articles of the Federal Law mentioned in the draft, as "Kommersant" wrote on August 2, companies whose beneficiaries (25% or more) are not tax residents of the Russian Federation or have dual citizenship may not be admitted to the auction.
The government has the right to impose such restrictions, as the Dry Log belongs to the federal reserves (reserves of over 50 tons of gold).
The Ministry of Natural Resources confirmed that the project "contains restrictions on the admission of foreign companies", but refused to comment on the details until the government's order.
The demand for state participation in the capital of the auction participants was put forward by the Irkutsk region, was told in December 2015 "Ъ" in the Ministry of Nature and confirmed later by the governor of the region Sergey Levchenko, noting that it was sent to the Ministry of Nature by his predecessor Sergey Eroschenko, "who had an agreement on investment projects with Rostec".
Who lobbied for the restriction of the entry of foreigners, the interlocutors of "Kommersant" do not specify.
"But it's in the spirit of the times: not to give up control of Russia's largest gold deposit against the backdrop of Western sanctions", a source familiar with the auction's preparation told Kommersant.
The head of the Ministry of Natural Resources, Sergei Donskoy, said on August 1 that foreigners "can join the consortium" if the applicants will attract them "as a financial structure, technological partners".
The interlocutors of "Ъ" believe it is unlikely that the government will adjust the conditions.
The main contender for the Dry Log in the industry is considered to be the consortium of the largest gold miner of the Russian Federation PJSC "Polus", controlled by Suleiman Kerimov's son Saida, and "Rostech".
As "Ъ" wrote, in July, the partners created the joint venture "SL Zoloto", where "Polys" has 51% of the shares, the structure of "Rostec" RT-GR - 49%.
Rostec declined to comment, while Polus told Kommersant that it is "certainly interested in this asset" and has all the necessary competencies and resources to develop it.
"But the final decision on the possibility and format of our participation will be made after the announcement of the conditions", added "Poleus".
The auction may be attended by ALROSA, but the decision is up to the Russian government, the sources of "Kommersant" said.
The possibility of participating in the development of Dry Log was claimed by the Russian GV Gold and the Canadian Kinross, which develops assets on Chukotka, while Polymetal and Nordgold, according to "Ъ", are not interested in the asset.
The head of the Union of Goldsmiths of the Russian Federation Sergey Kashuba in December 2015 estimated "Ъ" investments in Sukhya Log in $ 2.5-4 billion.
Most potential applicants are scared off not only by the amount of investment, but also by the complexity of the project: it requires serious exploration of reserves and technology for working with complex ores, explain industry interlocutors of "Ъ".
The largest M&A transaction in the pension market was launched - "KIT Finans Pension Administrator" launched the process of uniting four controlled NPFs.
As a result, on the basis of the "Gas Fund Pension Savings" will be created a non-profit pension fund with an accumulated volume of about 373 billion rubles.
The procedure of combining four pension funds - "KIT Finance", "Promagrofund", "Heritage" and "Gazfund Pension Savings" - was launched yesterday, the owner of 100% of the funds of the LLC "KIT Finance Pension Administrator" reported.
"The reorganization is carried out in agreement with the Central Bank, subject to the requirement of not worsening the conditions of the existing contracts", the company said in a statement.
The merger is being carried out on the basis of the "Gazfondy Pensionskumuti".
As the general director of this NGO Oleg Byaloshitskiy notes, the merger of the funds allows solving several tasks: expanding the geography of presence, concentrating resources for development, reducing costs, replicating the best practices of each of the funds and optimizing corporate governance.
According to him, the estimated completion date of the consolidation is the second quarter of 2017.
As a result of the merger, Gazfond Pensionary Accumulation will become the largest player in the OPS market.
As of March 31, the pension savings of the merging funds exceeded 373 billion rubles.
As follows from the reporting on the website of the funds, the beneficiaries of their owner - "KIT Finance Pension Administrator" - are currently Anatoly Gavrilenko (through controlled LLC owns 65%) and NPF "Gazfond" (35%).
However, the group launched the merger much later than its competitors.
So, the O1 Group-controlled NPF "Future" absorbed "Stalfund" at the beginning of this year.
Currently, this combined NPF is joining the Uralsib and Russian Standard funds.
"The unification into a single structure, in addition to reducing costs, is necessary to solve structural problems", - notes the general director of the NPF "Future" Nikolai Sidorov.
Active work on consolidating funds since April is also in the pension group "Saffmar" - the NPF "European", "Education and Science" and "Regional Fund" should be merged into the NPF "Saffmar" until the end of this year.
In 2017, the Trust will join them.
"The merger of the funds will have the effect of increasing control over risks, operational processes and expenses", said Safmar's pension group.
The pause in the fund pooling that KIT Finance Pension Administrator endured could be due to several reasons, experts point out.
Until recently, NPFs could not buy more than 40% of the volume of infrastructure bonds issued, in which the group was actively placed.
After the amendments to the Central Bank's resolution in March of this year, a number of issuers that meet the requirements of the regulator no longer have such restrictions.
If necessary, the whole issue can be bought by one large player", says the director of the group of financial institutions ratings of the AKRA, Yury Nogin.
Several NPF managers in the top 15 in assets cite another possible reason for the pause as the separation of spheres of influence and, as a consequence, staff appointments in a single fund, which had to be agreed by the owners of the group.
Anatoly Gavrilenko was unavailable for comment yesterday.
The "Ъ" request to the Gazfond NPF was also not answered.
While fund-raising is a time-consuming and costly endeavor, it's a decision that will pay off in the long run.
As the general director of the consulting company "Pension Partner" Sergei Okolesnov notes, the "Gazfond Pension Accumulation" has fewer outflows, the merger will allow to stabilize the base of other funds of the group.
At the same time, the more successful experience of KIT Finance and Promagro Fund in building retail sales of OPS, as well as the use of more modern software, will be in demand.
The Central Bank's requirements for the processes and personnel of NPFs are constantly growing, so it is not advisable to duplicate the infrastructure on four funds with a single investment policy, managing director for corporate ratings "Expert RA" Pavel Mitrofanov believes.
"The effect of reducing duplicate functions is to significantly reduce the possible costs of integration", Mr Mitrofanov notes.
The cost of merging four funds is estimated by Sergei Okolesnov at 30-50 million rubles.
"The cost of maintaining four funds of this size is about 400 million rubles. per year, with consolidation in the medium term budget can be reduced by half", - Mr. Okolesnov.
The Russian release of the best Disney movie "Pete and his dragon".
Beautiful New Zealand views, a gentle dragon, a heartwarming story, and country music are enough to make you believe in old-fashioned magic again, says ELENA KRAWTSUN.
The frightened little one was picked up by a dragon who became a human cub and a tender nanny and a loyal friend.
Pete names his buddy Elliot, after the puppy from the storybook, plays catch-up with him and falls asleep in a hug.
Six years later, he's all grown up and wearing a leg brace, and no longer distinguishable from the other clever forest scout, Mowgli.
Pete is discovered by the red-haired female tiger Grace (Bryce Dallas Howard) while the brigade of Gavin (Carl Urban), her husband's brother, is aggressively cutting down the forest.
Now she's not only going to have to believe in the dragon, but she's going to have to help save it.
Pete is on a crash course in "being human" surrounded by idyllic Americans who wear cowboy shirts, have a moral code at heart and a smile more dazzling than any advertisement.
No character looks or acts too bad for the viewer to really hate or fear.
Even Gavin, who has discovered the hunting of an unusual inhabitant of his domain, is far from being an incorrigible villain.
The huge, fluffy dragon was not at all scary, with a good-natured bulldog face, airplane-like wings and the ability to become invisible.
The dragon is a funny snorting, purring, even purring and, fortunately, does not speak, but it always wants to be stroked, which is advantageously different from all known cinematic dragons.
Elliot's visual image and his manner of holding himself provide such a high degree of emotional involvement that in the most tense moments, not only the little spectators but also the adults begin to cry desperately in three streams.
Surprisingly good and young Oakes Figley as Pete, torn between potential family and a true friend.
And Robert Redford has masterfully produced the canonical grandfather that every child would love to have.
How did director David Lowery manage to make a fantastically cute remake of the forgotten 1977 Disney film Pete the Dragon, mediocre from head to tail and remembered only as a mix of animation and live action, and make it the most heartfelt film of the summer?
It was a miracle.
In his painting, Lowry took only two things from the original: the orphan Pete and the dragon.
There are musical numbers and a lot of weird jokes.
This good story is told in the form of "Bambi", "The Alien", and many other heart-warming children's stories.
Disney Studios continues to expand its gallery of high-quality 21st century remakes.
Of course, "Pete and the Dragon" isn't as dazzlingly beautiful as "The Jungle Book", and it doesn't have the skilled villain that Cate Blanchett has in her new "Cinderella" role as the stepmother.
But this naive film is equally successful in helping us believe in miracles and the good in the best Disney traditions.
By the way, the keys to the magic Disney castle will be given to director Lowry once again for the feature film adaptation of Peter Pan.
The "Pete and the Dragon" tandem, David Lowry and screenwriter Toby Halbrooks, have entered an ambitious new project about a boy who never grows up, based on the James Barry fairy tale of the same name.
RBC journalist Alexander Sokolov is facing a new charge
Lawyers for RBC journalist Alexander Sokolov, accused of organizing the activities of an extremist structure, said that the prosecution found flaws in their client's case.
We learned from the investigators just yesterday that the prosecutor's office made such a representation.
We were scheduled to participate in a court hearing on the issue of limiting access to criminal case materials, but the hearing did not take place, and the investigators informed us about the submission made by the prosecutor's office", RBC quotes lawyer Olga Dinze as saying.
She said the prosecutor's office had pointed out to investigators that the case and the materials were not in keeping with the classification.
Now, the investigators will have to close the evidence and charge Alexander Sokolov with a new crime.
Either another article of the Criminal Code (CC) will appear in the case, or it will remain the same, but with other arguments and new evidence, Ms. Dinze clarifies.
As reported by "Kommersant", Alexander Sokolov was arrested on July 29, 2015.
In June this year, it was reported that the investigation had excluded from the indictment of the RBC journalist the wording of "shaking the political situation towards instability" and "overthrowing the government by illegal means".
The correspondent of "Kommersantboscosport" ALEXANDER ZILBERT lived the life of an Olympian in the Olympic village, inspected the house of the Russian team, ate lunch in the local dining room and even took the WADA test after that.
It seems like life doesn't stop for a second.
Even at night.
The last few starts sometimes finish at midnight, after which the athletes need another hour and a half or two to return to the Olympic village.
In addition, there is a constant flow of settlers and emigrants, as some athletes leave Brazil after their performances, while others arrive here.
And at 7:30 in the morning, the heads of all the Olympic delegations are huddled in one of the temporary tents.
At these meetings, we usually discuss some operational issues, - says the head of the sports delegation of the Olympic team of Russia Igor Kazikov. - Despite the fact that the house in which our team is located, consider it exemplary - it was commissioned one of the first and demonstrated to all inspectors, even in it some imperfections are found.
There's the hot water problem, and, excuse me, the toilet.
We fought for cleanliness for a long time.
At first, no one came to clean up.
Then the cleaners started coming, but they just shoveled some stuff on the floor, that's all.
Their floors are, you see, kind of innovative.
They say you can't wash them humanely.
We know these floors are laminate.
So we got a change of cleaning company, and now it's all good.
The Olympic Village is a kind of South Butovo, a sleeping area, fenced on one side by mountains, on the other - by an impressive moat, places flooded with water.
And for security, there's a six-foot-high iron fence around the perimeter, with machine guns running alongside.
The village can accommodate up to 17 thousand people in 3604 apartments, located in 31 houses.
On one of the 18-story buildings hangs a huge Russian flag - this house is completely devoted to the needs of our national team.
Looking at the small lobby at the entrance, you can immediately determine which problems seem to be the most urgent for the domestic team.
There are two ads on the check-in counter: a printed "Please do not flush toilet paper!" and a handwritten "I will accept gift badges.
The counter is flooded with booklets.
Their cheerful coloring contrasts with the headlines of the brochures: "Infectious Disease Warnings for Travellers to Rio de Janeiro", "First Aid for Drowning, Inhalation of a Foreign Body, Loss of Consciousness - Stages of Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation", and "First Aid for Burn, Heat Stroke, Fractures and Bleeding".
The text inside is generally encouraging.
For example, "Infection is followed by fever and subsequent cure.
However, not everyone will be blessed.
Of course, there is a medical center in the Russian team's home, which is ready to provide qualified assistance to the residents of the house at any time, including relaxing and sports massage.
Across the street from the medical center is our delegation headquarters.
Next to the door is an inspiring poster "No matter what, we will win!"
And, of course, the lyrics:
All the arguments are absolute nonsense!
And none will believe in them except those who are mindful of God.
The fewer we are, the sweeter the taste of victory, Russia will not retreat, will not break!
And for added encouragement, the announcement reads: "Dear brothers and sisters!
By the blessing of the Holy Patriarch of Moscow and All Russia Kirill, the spiritual care of the athletes of the Russian Olympic team is carried out by the protopreater Andrey Vladimirovich Alekseev.
You can order the molebens and other treats by phone...
In fact, there is a meditation and religious center for all faiths in the village.
Well, the Russians, it turns out, are in a privileged position - they have their own chapel.
Because of the overcrowded elevator from the ninth to the fourth floor, I decided to take the recommended fire escape.
And in the darkness, he stumbled upon the bodies lying on it.
Apparently, they were sleeping employees of a new cleaning company.
I guess, ready to throw themselves into the washing of the innovative floors, they decided to take a quiet moment on the cold steps.
On the fourth floor I was waiting to meet a long-time friend - Vitaly Fedorovich Dubko, the coach of our batting team, who led them to Olympic gold 16 years ago in Sydney.
He and his pupil, the European champion Yana Pavlova, kindly agreed to show their rooms.
There is nothing to complain about, - the honored coach of Russia shares his impressions. - We live in pairs, the beds, of course, are almost inexpensive, but it is not critical.
The lounge is one for four, but it's spacious.
The closet, of course, is funny, made of cloth, not very trustworthy, but you can put things in.
"No, you're just pretending, they're out of tea!" - says tennis player Svetlana Kuznetsova, whom I met in the main dining room.
It is called the main one at least because it is a space of 2.7 thousand square meters and is ready to receive 5 thousand visitors at the same time.
They're giving out 60,000 servings a day for free.
The menu options are as follows: "Best of Brazil", "World Cuisine", "Asian dishes" and "Pizza, pasta".
The latter, as I have seen, is very popular with our volleyball players.
And yet, I found no soup in any of the departments of the giant restaurant.
"What soup?" Kuznetsova is surprised. "There is no tea!
Good thing I brought a Chinese, a braised one.
And the teapot.
But just so you understand, the food on our court is worse.
There's a choice to be made here, despite the unbearable monotony.
I personally chose steamed cod and fried chicken in tomato sauce.
Each dish is accompanied by a label with its name in three languages - English, French, and Portuguese - and a list of its nutritional value and allergens.
And quite, I must say, edible.
I don't know why there's a line at the local McDonald's all the time.
The athletes, who are well fed, relaxed and, you could say, "warm", are being met by our best friends, the representatives of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA).
They're tricking you with a quiz, the winner of which gets a T-shirt.
They're provoking, you might say!
To get a gift, you have to answer at least eight out of ten questions correctly.
I was attacked by a WADA girl.
But it wasn't the one she was targeting.
I mean, I was in a patriotic mood, naturally.
The situation escalated with the second question: "If I receive a notification of a drug test, should I immediately go to a drug test?"
I went with option B: "No, I have one hour".
He lost his vigilance, so to speak.
I forgot that you can't expect WADA to back off.
Well, we should be here right away.
Well, in the seventh round of the quiz, my situation became critical.
I thought to myself, if I'm having trouble keeping a balanced diet because of my busy schedule (which I am!), I can use supplements to get "additional nutrients to enhance my performance".
No, they won't!
In fact, the answer is worded in such a way that it is not categorically forbidden, but insistently, in several sentences, it is disallowed.
It's not fair to WADA!
"How are you, Russia?" the quiz host asks mockingly.
There's nowhere to retreat behind Yefimov, Isinbayev and our entire team of bloodsuckers.
So I focused and with my last breath, I won the wretched T-shirt.
You know what they say, our own!
In a victory spirit, I went to the nearby gym.
I got caught up in counting gymnastics.
I'm down to 250.
He was surprised to see that not a single Russian athlete was found in this pile of running tracks.
But maybe it's the right thing to do.
Let the one who can't play play play!
And there's a guy in the nearby clinic who was a patient of ours.
In line for an eye doctor.
Don't worry, not the shooter.
In the clinic, however, as in the whole village, wherever there is spit, there is a machine for issuing condoms.
It has a cheery message on it: "Celebrate with a condom!"
All you have to do is turn the handle of the door lock, and the condom, made from natural latex from the Amazon, falls out of the machine.
I took one to remember.
The athletes have been given 450 thousand .
For the sake of the holiday, the Olympic Village has an entertainment center.
Next to it, just in case, is a little sign that reminds you that the International Olympic Committee is spending $3.25 million a day on athletes in various ways.
The mall is flooded with video games, pool tables, tennis courts, table football and hockey, and some strange gadgets that look like video gyms.
I'm interested in a comrade in the uniform of the Ukrainian national team, who actively uses a bizarre toy.
I could just say I don't want to talk to a man in a Russian uniform, that's all.
By the way, some strange coincidence has the boys in the yellow and blue in the eyes.
The most played team, it turns out.
It takes at least three hours to go around the village, looking at every corner.
But if you walk, instead of riding electric cars, you'll also have a Canadian team house with a moose in the entrance and a tent with a recovery bath, and a ticket office, and a laundry, and a dry cleaner, and a hairdresser, and a flower shop, and a shop with everyday goods, and a post office with unique stamps (you just can't wait in line from Chinese philatelists anyway), and a bank, and a finds bureau, and a photo kiosk.
And late in the evening, exhausted, you will sit by an olive tree, decorated with ribbons of various colors in memory of your friends and relatives, the athletes who have passed away.
And you'll be accompanied by a machine that sprays insect-killing fluid at random, thinking about eternity.
I mean, the Olympic movement.
Which in this village never stops for a minute.
While the rest of the Russian world watched in awe as the Australians nearly punished the American Dream Team, the real fans went online.
Few people know that I was the first to receive the news that Inna Deriglazova won the gold medal in the rapids at the XXXI Olympic Games.
I may be the only Muscovite who saw it happen, except, of course, those who watched the Carioca that night.
Only a true fan would understand that.
Imagine this: the dead of night in Moscow.
The downstairs neighbors, as they always do at one o'clock in the morning, wake up and start yelling at each other, very loudly, but not in a bad way.
And threatening to move furniture.
There's a leaky faucet in the kitchen, so there's no time to go to the market and buy a new one, like the plumber said.
The TV schedule doesn't make any sense, so I just kept an eye on Match, One and Russia just in case - although it's almost meaningless.
Russia is the home of repeaters, the whole sport is recorded there for some reason.
They have live TV shows.
Hope, of course, for the "Match" - all evening the young man was shouting in the news first about the great semi-final of Deriglasov-Shanaev, then about the upcoming fight for gold.
It would be logical to show it.
But instead, basketball is USA-Australia.
I can't say anything bad about this decision, by the way.
The Australians were even, and won the first half.
Put in place of the Americans who were overwhelmed by their own greatness.
The result was a loss, but, as they say now, the Olympic basketball tournament will never be the same.
It's all good, but the fight with DiFrancesca is coming up, and the screen is unchanged.
I'm just going through the channels in a little panic.
It's like the second time they've been spinning.
All right, let's go in deep, to the cable.
There's no fencing in any of the thematic "Matches".
And I have a feeling the fight's about to start.
Text and Twitter feeds from some sports sites don't work for me.
The result of cramp surfing is unexpected but brilliant.
The First's website, it turns out, is a live technical broadcast of all the competitions that are taking place at this point in time.
I call a fencing match, I get a gold fight.
Deriglasov is counterattacking, he's leading the pack, and he's clearly running out of time.
The Italian girl plays most of the game.
We're one point ahead, just over two seconds to go.
Di Francesca throws herself at Deriglazova, she retreats, time is running out, the Italian injects.
A win!
A few seconds later, the Olympic messenger on the phone says there's a fourth gold medal.
I'm the first one to see it.
Crazy, loyal, and involved.
The Tatarstan Muslims' Spiritual Directorate (TUM) refuses to use the Russian language in mosques.
Yesterday, the DUM plenum obliged its imams to deliver Friday sermons only in Tatar, to force young Tatars to "learn their native language".
The administration claims that this "in no way infringes" on the rights of Muslims of other nationalities.
In some mosques in Kazan, up to 60% of the congregation, including foreign students, migrants and Tatars themselves, complain that they do not understand the Tatar language.
Imams fear that their sermons in Tatar "will not reach the entire audience".
Yesterday, the plenum of the Tatarstan DUM unanimously decided to hold Friday sermons in mosques of the republic only in the Tatar language.
As the mufti of Tatarstan Kamil Samigullin stated, this should be an incentive for young Tatars to "learn their native language".
"For those who say that it is 'difficult', in every large mosque we intend to organize lessons of the Tatar language absolutely free", - promised Mr. Samigullin.
He added that "the decision has already come into force" and today in all mosques the sermons "must be in the Tatar language".
He reminded that the Tatarstan Church Ministry publishes the magazine "Shoura" with typical sermons in the Tatar language.
An imam who doesn't speak Tatar well enough "can prepare thoroughly for them".
The TATARSTAN DUM unites more than a thousand parishes in all municipalities of the republic.
According to the mufti, in the districts, Friday sermons are conducted exclusively in the Tatar language.
At the same time, in Kazan, a number of mosques previously used mostly Russian.
In particular, as the mufti pointed out, this was practiced in the Burnaev Mosque, Zakabannaya and "Eniler".
However, Mr. Muhametshin stressed that the leadership sets the task that all students should master both state languages of the republic, regardless of nationality.
"There can be no question of any discrimination against non-Tatar Muslims", Mr. Muhametshin stressed, explaining that preaching itself "is not a mandatory, basic part of the prayer".
The prayers will continue to be recited in Arabic, and the lectures and lessons will be preserved in Russian.
At the same time, Rafik Muhametshin told "Kommersant" that there was no serious threat of the Tatar language being pushed out of the mosques.
Other languages, such as Uzbek or Tajik, are not used in the sermons in the republic.
The decision of the MDC was actively supported in the executive committee of the World Congress of Tatars (WCT).
The head of the executive committee of the World Cultural Center, Rinat Zakirov, told "Kommersant": "Mosques are an important part of our national life".
It would be sad if the Tatar language were to disappear from this sphere.
He noted that the conduct of sermons only in the Tatar language is "the wish of the imams themselves", but in the executive committee of the WCT "consider it right".
The imams interviewed by "Ъ" who preached in Russian are ready to implement the decision of the DUM, but believe that the parishioners will have difficulties with understanding the clergy.
Tatars and Russians go to the mosque.
Many don't understand the language.
It's going to be a little bit sad.
"We will have to rebuild", says the imam of the Burna mosque, Farhat Mawletdinov.
According to him, preaching in Russian is closer even to many Tatars, because "Russian is in schools, in kindergartens, on the radio - everywhere".
However, he believes that the mosque will be able to continue the lessons and lectures in Russian that are held on other days.
We put our trust in Allah.
Allah will show the way out of this situation", he concluded.
But about 60% of us don't know Tatar.
They are Uzbek, Tajik and Azerbaijani.
We have a lot of foreign students, Africans, Arabs.
"That's why we've been switching to Russian for four years", the imam says.
He believes that the sermons in the Tatar language will "reach a narrower circle and will not reach the entire audience".
But we will abide by the decision of the plenum.
The simple result of the sermons will be different.
But time will tell.
"For me, for example, it will be easier, because the Tatar language is my native language", - concluded Gabdulla Galiullin.
Former FIDC Director brought to trial
The Moscow Prosecutor's Office approved the indictment in the criminal case investigated by the State Criminal Service of the Russian Federation on the theft of budget funds allocated for the needs of the Federal Criminal Investigation Service of Russia.
The former head of the prison department, Alexander Reimer, and his deputy will appear before the court for causing damage to the FSIN in the amount of more than 2.7 billion rubles.
The prosecutor's office sent to the Zamoskvorecsky district court a criminal case against the former director of the Federal Penitentiary of Russia Alexander Reymer, his former deputy Nikolai Krivolopov, as well as the director of the Federal State Unitary Public Prosecutor's Office "Center of Information and Technical Assistance and Communication of the Federal Penal Execution Service" (FGUT CITOS) Viktor Orenchenov.
Depending on the role and degree of participation in the commission of crimes, they are accused by the Moscow State Criminal Investigation Service of the Moscow Criminal Court under part 3 of article 285 of the RF criminal code (abuse of official powers, which has caused serious consequences), part 4 of article 159 of the RF criminal code (fraud, committed with the use of his official position, in the composition of an organized group, in a particularly large amount).
In addition, Krivolapov is charged under part 1 of Article 222 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation (illegal acquisition and storage of ammunition).
According to the CRC, in 2010-2012, these persons fraudulently stole from the state treasury the budget funds allocated by the FISIN to provide the agency with electronic monitoring systems of controlled persons, the so-called electronic bracelets.
To steal budget money, the group's members developed a scheme according to which the company controlled by them, FGUP CITOS, with which the relevant state contracts were concluded, produced technical control and supervision tools, including "electronic bracelets", and sold at prices several times overstated.
Despite the fact that the FGUP TsITOS did not have production equipment, buildings, facilities for the placement of production facilities, allowing to create a complete cycle of production of "electronic bracelets", between it and the Federal Service for the Investigation of the Criminal Procedure of Russia, five state contracts were concluded for a sum of more than 3,3 billion rubles.
As a result of this scheme, more than 2 billion rubles were found on the accounts of the Samara branch of the FGUP, of which 1.2 billion rubles were stolen.
According to the investigation, more than 140 million rubles of cashed funds were received personally by Mr. Reimer in his office from one of the accomplices, against whom the criminal case was separated into a separate production.
Nikolai Krivolapov, who participated in the machinations, was found with an unknown origin of the cartridge for the prize pistol, which allowed him to bring an additional charge.
In this case, which amounted to 133 volumes, the FISC to the accused claimed compensation for material damage in the amount of 2,7 billion rubles.
Football player Hakan Shukyor is suspected of being involved in the coup.
Turkish authorities issued an arrest warrant for former soccer player and then-parliament member Hakan Şukür and conducted searches in two of his family's homes.
Turkish football star Hacan Şükür, a striker from the 1990s and early 2000s, is wanted by the country's authorities in connection with the attempted coup d'état that took place last month.
Forward, who retired in 2008, is accused of being a member of an "armed terrorist group".
It is about the Hizmet movement, a society linked to the famous Turkish religious figure and oppositionist Fethullah Gülen.
He is the man that President Erdogan considers the organizer of the attempted military coup that took place on July 15.
Fethullah Gulen is living in the US, and the Turkish authorities are demanding his extradition.
According to local media, an arrest warrant was issued for Hakan Shukyu today, and police have already raided two homes belonging to the former footballer's family.
According to the investigation, Fethullah Gülen's organization included his father in addition to Hakan Shukyr himself.
However, neither the former footballer nor his relatives were there.
He and his family now live in the United States.
As a footballer, Hakan Şukür has played for several Turkish clubs and the national team.
He spent most of his career at Galatasaray.
The list of foreign clubs includes the Italian "Torino", "Inter" and "Palermo", as well as the English "Blackburn".
He never spent more than a season in any of them, though.
Hakan Şukkur is still the most successful Turkish striker: he has played 112 matches for the national team and scored 51 goals.
In 2013, Shukr left his parliamentary post due to the corruption investigation started around the party of Erdogan and his closest circle.
According to Hurriyet, at least 42 journalists were issued arrest warrants in Turkey on July 25.
They are accused of aiding a military coup and links to the opposition Islamic preacher Fethullah Gülen, who lives in the United States.
Given the severity of the charges, the media workers could face long prison terms, ranging from ten years to several life sentences.
Yegor Konchalovsky wants to create a network of cinemas for only domestic films.
"I would have created a network of cinemas exclusively for Russian cinema, tickets for which cost 2-3 times less than foreign films", he said.
Mr. Konchalovsky notes that Russian films have a hard time competing with the big Hollywood films for viewership.
In our country, more than 100 paintings are made a year, of which an average of 20-25 tapes reach the screens.
"And it's very hard for them to compete with 'Transformers' and 'Iron Man,' which have huge budgets to promote", the filmmaker said.
The All-Russian youth educational forum "Tavrida" began its work in Crimea on July 1.

The new general contractor promises to hand over the Zenith Arena by December 26th.
The new general contractor of the stadium under construction in St. Petersburg, which is due to host the 2017 Confederations Cup and the 2018 World Cup, the Metrostroy company promises to lease the arena by December 26, RIA Novosti reports, citing the head of the temporary commission of the Federation Council for preparation for the 2018 World Cup Vadim Tyulpanov.
"Today, we visited the construction site together with the Russian Minister of Sports Vitaly Mutko, and the general director of MetroStroy Vadim Alexandrov was with us.
He said he'd be done with the stadium by December 26.
It's a serious St. Petersburg company, it never breaks deadlines.
Vitaly Mutko and I were satisfied with what we saw and heard"", - quotes the agency of the interlocutor.
Earlier, Vitaly Mutko arrived in St. Petersburg to inspect the venue for the upcoming large-scale competition.
Mr. Tülpanov also noted that the commission headed by him of the Federation Council will continue to monitor the course of the construction of the stadium and will regularly visit the construction site.
The same company won the bidding for the improvement of the territory around the stadium, the contract value - 2.4 billion rubles. Contracts with JSC "Corporation" Transstroy ", LLC" Engineering Corporation "Transstroy-SPb" and JSC "Engineering Corporation "Transstroy" "were terminated.
Two other companies were not allowed to compete for the construction of the stadium.

In Miass (Chelyabinsk region), the lawyer of former vice-governor Nikolay Sandakov, Konstantin Akulic, was detained.
As reported by "Ъ-Южный Урал" the other lawyer of the accused - Sergey Kolosovski, Konstantin Akulich was summoned today to the investigative department of the Miass SCR for the presentation of the accusation in the case of a year-old beating.
Then Konstantin Akulic went to the scene of the accident as a lawyer to help one of its participants.
"Initially it was triggered against unidentified persons, but now, when he started to defend Nikolai Sandakov, it turned out to be Akulic", said Kolossovsky.
Konstantin Akulic became the lawyer of the ex-deputy governor in early August.
At the same time, half an hour before the lawyer was summoned to the court, the defense was informed that the period for examining the fraud case against Nikolai Sandakov expired on Monday.
Two criminal cases have been opened against Nikolai Sandakov.
In the first (fraud case) he is accused of promising 1.5 million rubles to assist in the appointment of the mayor of Magnitogorsk, the head of the administration of Ozersk, Evgeny Tarasov.
The second criminal case concerns a bribe that Nikolai Sandakov allegedly received from the director of the PITON PTO Igor Kalugin in the form of illegal unrewarded provision of services of a property nature in the amount of at least 1.3 million rubles.
For more on Mr. Sandakov's case, see the article "The former vice governor demands that his cases be consolidated".
The Russian Copper Company (RMC) is ready to take on social responsibility and pay more attention to the environmental aspects of its business.
This is confirmed, for example, by the fact that RMK has undertaken to modernize one of the oldest and most ecologically "dirty" enterprises of the country - the Karabakh copper smelting plant.
Karabakh copper smelting plant was founded by the English joint-stock company headed by Leslie Urquart in 1910.
During the Soviet era, it was an important industrial enterprise for the country's economy, and it actually provided the livelihood of the entire city.
However, in the 1990s, due to financial problems, production was stopped, which led to serious social problems in Karabakh.
In 1998, it was decided to resume the work of the Karabakh copper smelter.
It was also necessary to solve one of the main problems of the Karabakh plant - the ecological one.
By the early 2000s, Karabakh was already notorious as an environmental disaster zone.
The situation at Karabashmedi began to change in 2004, after the enterprise passed under the management of the Russian Copper Company.
The company began to modernize its production, which gradually reduced the environmental burden.
This was recently noted by the governor of the Chelyabinsk region, Boris Dubrovsky, who visited the "Karabakh" in the early days of July.
The head of the Southern Urals called the grand changes that have occurred with the enterprise since the "Karabakhmadi" has moved to the RMK group.
The main event of the modernization of "Karabashmedi" in recent years was the construction of a new sulfuric acid workshop, which allows to capture up to 99.9% of metallurgical gases.
According to the president of the Russian Copper Company Vsevolod Levin, the amount of investment in this project amounted to about 7 billion rubles.
The next stage of modernization of Karabazhmedy ZAO is the reconstruction of the converter partition.
Replacement of three converters, aerosols, a gas-conducting tract is planned for the end of 2017.
The project cost is 2.5 billion rubles.
In addition, at the end of 2016, it is planned to launch a new industrial wastewater treatment plant worth 1 billion rubles.
In turn, the amount of taxes paid to the budget of Karabakh will increase.
For the entire period of the implementation of the Tominsk hydroelectric power plant project - from the beginning of construction and until the commissioning of the second stage - the federal treasury will receive 8.9 billion rubles.
And after the commissioning of the GOK, the tax revenue to the budgets of all levels may amount to 80.9 billion rubles.
For a year of production in the Varna district, 346.3 million rubles were transferred to budgets of different levels.
And that's for the first year.
"The longer the enterprise is successfully operating, the more the amount of the deductions can be", added Valery Ulanovsky.
RMK clarified that in 2015, tax deductions from Mikheevski GOK came close to 1 billion rubles.
However, the participation of RMC enterprises in the life and development of the territories where they are present is not limited to tax deductions.
RMC enterprises help to repair and maintain schools, kindergartens, sports facilities, build cultural and entertainment facilities, and improve the area.
In 2016, one of the largest social projects of the Russian Copper Company in Karabakh was the overhaul, and in fact - almost complete reconstruction of the kindergarten N9 for 95 pupils.
The building, built in 1960, was in a state of disrepair.
Also on the territory of "RMK Arena" will be a landscape park with an artificial pond, underground and above-ground parking lots for 600 cars, cafes and sports shops.
"RMK Arena" will allow to hold spectacular professional sports events of international level.
But the main goal of this project is to make physical education and sports activities accessible to the residents of Chelyabinsk, especially to children.

The military of the Black Sea Fleet conducted a drill on anti-submarine-diversion defense in the Black Sea.
This was reported by RIA Novosti representative of the press service of the Ministry of Defense for the Navy, Igor Digalo.
The exercises were conducted within the first stage of the exercises on special types of support for the actions of the Navy forces.

A court in the Moscow region has arrested the father for the murder of his adopted daughter: Investigation and court: Lenta.ru
The Moscow Region's Lake City Court has authorized the arrest of Roman Chernikov, who confessed to the murder of his six-year-old adopted daughter.

In particular, Roman Chernikov reported that he had killed a child on one of the days of April 2016 from personal unfriendly relations, being at home in a state of alcohol intoxication.
Then, to conceal the child's body, he burned it and scattered the remains along with his wife in a large square.
On the evening of August 9, during interrogation by the investigator, the foster parents reported that in April 2016, a six-year-old child drowned in the bathtub.
For a long time they managed to hide the disappearance of the girl from everyone, but in August, when they learned that the staff of the guardianship authorities were going to come to their home soon, they decided to tell everyone that the child was missing.
The parents claimed that on August 6, their adopted daughter had left the house where they lived with the family and disappeared.

A pensioner turned the stairwell into a "low-cost beach tower".
Netizens laughed at the photos of the elderly man who had set up a beach ladder and turned it into a diving trampoline.
The photo was published on several entertainment portals, as well as in the "My Taganrog" group in the social network "VKontakte", which led many to believe that the photo was taken on the shores of the Azov Sea.
In the comments, the "innovation" was dubbed "budget tower" and "mobile trampoline".
Many praised the man for his ingenuity and "smoothness", while some pointed out that the man was seriously risking injury when he jumped from his tower because he had set it at an insufficient depth.
However, one commentator on Pikabu noted that the depth of the sea cannot be judged by the picture.
"Firstly, we don't know how deep it is, the beach can be a steep drop of a meter just behind the stairs, and secondly, even if it is a meter deep, with proper skill you can jump from a couple of meters", wrote a user with the nickname C0JIbAMDJZ.
But the Italian newspaper Roma Today reports that a man with a ladder was spotted on a beach near Rome.

Authorities in the French city of Cannes have banned people from wearing burkinis - a swimming costume for women that completely covers the body from head to ankles - on local beaches.
This was reported by ABC News on Friday, August 12.
Mayor David Lisnard of Cannes explained that such clothing "is not in keeping with decency, secularism, hygiene and safety".
He also said that clothing that emphasizes religious affiliation can cause disorder.
A fine of 38 euros (about $42) has been imposed for wearing the burkini.
The ban was imposed in the wake of the July 15 attacks in Nice and the July 26 attacks on the church in the northern city of Saint-Étienne-du-Rouvré.

The court of the city of Blagoveshchensk (Amur region) sentenced the former head of the city Alexander Migul to nine years in a general regime colony.
This was reported on the court's website on Friday, August 12.
Migul was found guilty of committing crimes under Articles 286 ("Exceeding the powers"), 285.1 ("Unnecessary spending of budgetary funds") and 285 ("Misuse of official powers") of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation.
The investigation found that the official in December 2008 gave his acquaintance a land plot in the village of Muhinka in violation of the procedure established by the land legislation.
In 2006, he illegally issued a resolution to acquire the city's property of the Chigiri River motorway bridge, at an inflated price without competitive procedures and the conclusion of a municipal contract, Interfax clarifies.
In addition, in the period from 2007 to 2010, Migula changed the terms of payments under the purchase and sale contract of the lease of the land plot, which was provided for the construction of housing, in the interests of the commercial organization under his control, and also released the company from the lease fee.
As a result, the regional budget lost more than 5 million rubles, and the city treasury about 21 million rubles.
On August 4, it became known that the former mayor, who was under custody on suspicion of corruption, and who claimed a deputy mandate, did not submit the signatures to the election commission for participation in the elections to the State Duma and was removed from the pre-election race.
Migula was detained in May 2015 in the territory of the Lipetsk region and placed in the detention center.
He had been on the international wanted list since 2011.
Alexander Migula was the mayor of Blagoveshchensk from November 2004 to April 2010.

The Thai Ministry of Interior blamed the bombings on local saboteurs.
The bombings at Thai resorts are "acts of local sabotage" and have nothing to do with international terrorists.
Thai police said this, according to Reuters.
According to the police, they have not yet been able to determine if the explosions are connected.
The main story is that the organizers were trying to disrupt the tourist season.
It is possible that the bombings were carried out by separatist Muslims from the south of the country.
Law enforcement has already arrested several people.
At this point, we have four dead and dozens of wounded.
Prime Minister Prayut Chan-Ocha ordered additional security measures to prevent further explosions and to rule out possible casualties.
A series of explosions occurred in tourist resorts in Thailand on Friday, August 12.
The devices worked at police stations on Phuket Island, in the cities of Surat Thani (the capital of the province of the same name, which includes Samui Island) and Huachin.

Owners of messengers and postal services must identify users and delete prohibited information - this is the summary of the draft law developed by the Media Communication Union (MCS), which unites the largest Russian communications operators (the "Vedomosti" has it).
Employees from the three member companies confirmed that such a project was being discussed.
In early autumn, it should be presented to a working group headed by First Deputy Prime Minister Igor Shuvalov, says the interlocutor of "Vedomosti" in the ISS.
We're talking about the amendments to the communications and media laws.
They provide that any "organizer of the distribution of information on the Internet network, providing the possibility of exchanging electronic messages", is obliged to identify users on the basis of information contained in the databases of communication operators, having previously concluded contracts with them.
And "immediately block messages or publications that contain information disseminated in violation of the requirements of Russian law".
Otherwise, operators have the right to restrict access to the service by the decision of Roskomnadzor.

Astronomers have discovered a mysterious cosmic object beyond Neptune.
The object is very faint, measuring about 125 miles [200 km] in diameter, says New Scientist.
According to the researchers, the object is moving in an orbit that is completely uncharacteristic for the solar system.
It's almost perpendicular to the other planets.
The mysterious find was named Niku, which translates from Chinese as "rebellious", "unconquerable".
WSJ: The US is considering sanctions against Russia over the hack of the Democrats' servers.
U.S. officials are considering new sanctions against Russia in response to the hacking of Democratic Party servers, The Wall Street Journal reported, citing sources.
The administration of US President Barack Obama will reportedly have to officially blame Russia or Russian-backed hackers for the attack on the servers in order to impose sanctions.
Sources say the FBI and other U.S. intelligence agencies are almost certain that Russia was behind the cyberattack.
The WSJ notes that the US typically prefers not to name the perpetrators of hacking attacks.
The exception is the breach of the Sony Entertainment Pictures database in 2014, which was officially attributed to the DPRK.
But last year, Obama issued an executive order that simplified the process of sanctioning those who carry out or facilitate cyberattacks.
It was originally aimed at China, but it can be used against other countries.
The process of deciding on sanctions can be lengthy, the publication says.
Even if officials conclude that the hackers were backed by Russia, they will have to weigh the potential consequences before deciding whether to disclose the information.
They have to determine if the incident is serious enough to cause an escalation of tension in bilateral relations.
Earlier, it was reported that the Obama administration is considering sanctions against the state that was hacked by the Democratic National Committee.
WikiLeaks has released the emails of the Democratic National Committee.
Media reports have suggested that hackers working with Russian authorities may have been involved.
The Kremlin called such reports absurd.
FAS fined Google almost half a billion rubles
The reason was the violation of competition in the mobile application market.
The antitrust case was initiated by Yandex.
The Russian company claimed that Google gave smartphone manufacturers access to Android components on terms that prohibited pre-installation of apps from other developers, in particular from Yandex.
The FAS found evidence to support these claims and found that the company abused its dominant market position and forced mobile device manufacturers to install other apps alongside the Google Play store.
Following the results of the investigation, the Federal Antimonopoly Service decided to punish Google, said the deputy head of the FAS, Alexey Dotenko.
The fine must be paid within 60 days of the order's coming into force.
The FAS concluded that the law on the protection of competition should be observed by all companies, including transnational corporations.
Google, for its part, intends to study the decision first and then decide on the next steps: to execute it or to contest it.
The Federal Antimonopoly Service found the company in violation of the competition law last September and ordered to correct the contracts until December 18.
But Google did not agree to that.
The company and the agency have been in litigation ever since.
The FAS noted that despite the fine, they are discussing with Google the possibility of concluding a settlement agreement.
This measure will lead to nothing.
This opinion of "Ehu Moscow" was expressed by the leading analyst of the Mobile research group Eldar Murtazin.
Murtasin also noted that the fine would have no effect on users or the corporation's competitiveness.
The villager rented an apartment, and then robbed it for 84 thousand rubles.
Thirty-year-old robber sold off stolen home appliances in his own time.

The man told law enforcement that an unknown person had rented his apartment.
When the owner came to check on his home, he found it completely empty - no washing machine, no TV, no refrigerator, no tenant.
The total amount of damage was 84 thousand rubles.
Soon the policemen were on the trail of the thief.
Turns out he's an unemployed 30-year-old from the village of Vlčíček.
The man was arrested, he gave a confession, saying that he had already sold the stolen property.
Now he'll have to answer for theft in the strictest sense of the law - a criminal case has been opened against the detainee.
This year, the Crimeans will receive a notification for the payment of transportation tax.
Now the people of the peninsula will pay taxes on land, property and transportation.
This was stated at a press conference by the head of the Federal Tax Service Administration in the Republic of Kazakhstan, Roman Nastratschev.
By the end of 2016, Crimean car owners will receive a notice to pay the transport tax.
So far, the IRS has counted about 250,000 people who own motor vehicles.
The data on taxpayers will be provided by the GIBD, Rosreestr.
"If as of January 1 we will be given information about owners of real estate and land plots, then next year the citizens of Crimea will be the payers of these taxes" - said Roman Nasrachev.
There will be tax relief for certain categories of citizens, primarily pensioners.
Also, there is a system of deductions for land tax depending on the preferential category of the taxpayer, but, according to the head of the Federal Tax Service, it is too early to talk about this until 2017.

The "Anime" effect on Snapchat is being criticized as a caricature of Asians
Snapchat claims that this filter is anime-inspired, but some reviewers say it's racially tactless.
With Lens, Snapchat allows approximately 150 million users a day to alter reality and play with individuality in ways that border on absurd.
You can turn yourself into a pineapple, a dog, or a character in a painting by Roy Lichtenstein.
Lenses are rough, curving tools that create over 30 million corrected selfies a day.
Any mistakes quickly become public knowledge.
Snapchat lenses have been criticized in the past when they were accused of advertising dark facial skin or promoting white faces as the ideal of beauty.
So when some users this week were offered a lens that gave them squinting eyes, crooked teeth and puffy cheeks, some critics saw it as a racist caricature of Asians  "ironheads".
And they wondered if these recurring contradictions pointed to a more serious company problem, one related to diversity.
The Verge and Motherboard reported backlash and outrage on Wednesday, the day after Snapchat said it was removing the feature.
The company commented that the lens was designed as a tribute to the anime characters, not a caricature of Asians.
But for experts who know racism by heart, the lens reminded us of the offensive stereotypes in action.
Others completely rejected the anime comparison.
In an email, Grace Sprapani, a Korean-American art student whose tweets about the photos were widely shared, said the lens was "offensive and at the very least awkward".
She added that "it's hard to argue with the side-by-side comparison of very crude Asian cartoons and the filter effects.
This shows that the filter is not just yellow-lily, but highly degrading yellow-lily.
Snapchat isn't the only company that's going through these cultural bridges.
American culture seems to be caught up in an endless struggle for diversity and inclusivity, from corporate boardrooms to Hollywood and the gadgets we all carry around with us.
And the huge audience of young people on Snapchat -- who are more racially diverse than their older generation -- may mean that they're more likely to be understood.
When one of Snapchat's lenses creates an image that is offensive to the user, then, said 25-year-old Katie Zhou in an interview on Thursday, "it's much harder for that to go unnoticed than it used to".
On Thursday, Zhu, a product manager and engineer who works at Medium, decided to delete her Snapchat account and encouraged others to do the same.
In a Medium article and a phone interview, she said she believes racial bias is the reason for the lack of diversity in Snapchat recruitment.
She criticized the company's predominantly white, all-male management and ended her post with the hashtag #DeleteSnapchat.
As Zhu, herself a Chinese-American, wrote, "Either they didn't have enough non-white people on their staff to make those decisions, or they have non-white people working for them, but they don't have positions where they can speak up safely and openly".
Other reviewers shared her view, expressing displeasure that Snapchat had not answered most of her questions.
The company does not publish information about the representation of national minorities in its staff, emphasizing its status as a private company.
On Thursday, Snapchat declined to discuss the racial background of its staff, but a source said the company recently hired a recruiter to focus on underrepresented populations and to actively engage internal resources.
For her part, Zhu said she would keep her Snapchat account closed, adding: "I wonder if they really need more users like us to be able to say that this is not going to work".
Military leadership misrepresented intelligence on ISIS, reports congressional committee
Officials at the U.S. Central Command have altered intelligence reports to present a more optimistic picture of the war against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria than is warranted by events on the ground, a congressional panel said in a report released Thursday.
The interim report of the task force established by Republican chairmen of the House Committee on Armed Services, the Intelligence Committee and the Military Appropriations Subcommittee found "widespread discontent" among intelligence analysts at the Central Command who claimed that the chiefs had misrepresented their assessments of American actions aimed at defeating the Islamic State.
Central Command, known as CENTCOM, is the headquarters of the military in Tampa, Florida, which oversees U.S. military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
"Intelligence documents approved by the CENTCOM high command tended to paint a more optimistic picture of U.S. counterterrorism operations than was supported by actual on-the-ground data, and were consistently more optimistic than the analysis provided by other intelligence services", a news release on the report said.
"What has been happening in the Central Committee is unacceptable: When the top leadership is presented with an inaccurate analysis, our military suffers", said Representative Ken Calvert, a Republican from California.
The leadership problems at Centcom are reaching the very top of the organization.
The ten-page report details the shortcomings that persisted in 2014 and 2015 in the description and analysis of U.S. operations to train Iraqi forces provided by Central Command.
While it does not contain conclusive evidence that members of the Obama administration's leadership ordered the report to be falsified, it claims that analysts felt that the Centcom leadership was forcing them to present a more optimistic view of the threat from the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL.
"Throughout the first half of 2015, many of the press releases, statements and witness testimony of the Central Command in Congress were significantly more optimistic than the actual events", the report said.
For example, a Centcom official has publicly stated that a major military attack aimed at retaking Mosul could begin as early as April or May 2015.
Mosul, Iraq's second largest city, remains under the control of the Islamic State.
"After months of investigation, this is what we know for sure",  said in a statement Representative Mike Pompeo, a Republican from Kansas.
From mid-2014 to mid-2015, the highest levels of the intelligence service of the US Central Command were falsifying the intelligence documents of the command to belittle the threat from ISIS in Iraq.
Republicans created a task force when they learned analysts had expressed concern that intelligence on the Islamic State was being falsified.
As the investigation progresses, the report, which was released on Thursday, will be followed by more detailed data.
The additional, unfinished investigation of the intelligence of the Centcom is conducted by the Chief Inspector of the Ministry of Defense.
Democratic officials on the House Intelligence Committee released their own data Thursday that agrees with some of the findings of the Republican task force.
"Between 2014 and 2015, the Central Intelligence Agency created an overly closed-door intelligence-gathering procedure for ISIS and the Iraqi security forces", House Speaker Adam B. Schiff, the Democratic chief representative on the committee, said in a statement.
This procedure, according to Schiff, "has impeded the release of intelligence documents", damaged the morale of analysts, and "inadequately reflects divergent views".
Schiff and the Democrats claim they have found no evidence that the White House attempted to coerce Centcom analysts into fitting their conclusions to "a set or political interpretation".
Preliminary results of the Congressional investigation were released Tuesday by The Daily Beast.
Last August, the New York Times reported on the existence of an investigation by the Pentagon's chief inspector, opened after complaints by Centcom analysts.
Lt. Commander Patrick Evans, a Pentagon spokesman, said in a statement that the Department of Defense would not comment on the congressional report while the inspector general's investigation is ongoing.
But he said that "experts sometimes disagree in interpreting complex data, and intelligence agencies and the Department of Defense welcome healthy dialogue on these vital national security issues".
The implications of the investigation go beyond the question of whether the US-led bombing of Iraq and Syria is achieving its goals (as more and more Defense Department officials now claim).
But last year's statements raise questions about whether President Obama can trust that the Central Command is providing truthful assessments of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other hotspots.
The criticism of the intelligence community on the Islamic State echoes a controversy that took place more than a decade ago, when Centcom intelligence analyst Gregory Hooker wrote a research article that claimed that the administration of President George Walker Bush, due to the protest of many analysts, had come out in support of a small number of troops in Iraq and had not thought about what would follow the 2003 invasion.
Hooker also played a key role in the protest sparked by intelligence on the Islamic State.
Last year, officials said, Hooker's team concluded that despite public claims to the contrary, airstrikes on oil refineries owned by the Islamic State did not significantly worsen the financial position of the terrorist group because it had built makeshift refineries to sell oil on the black market.
But the discovery was not widely reported outside Central Command, as reported in the Times in September.
The then-central commander, General Lloyd J. Austin III, came under criticism last year after testimony in the Senate that many lawmakers deemed an overly optimistic assessment of the war.
General Austin retired in April and was replaced at Central Command by Gen. Joseph L. Votel.
The U.S. wins four straight women's field hockey games, bringing them one step closer to a decisive match against Britain.
Once a three-goal scorer in a 6-1 win over Japan, Katie Baum opened the scoring Thursday with the first two goals for the U.S. women's field hockey team as the Americans beat India 3-0.
Five goals in two games should be a memorable achievement, but Bham, 27, says she's not sure she would have done something like that.
"I'm not going to do it", she said.
I'm not really the type of person who tracks their goals.
Here's what she knows: the Americans are 4-0 in the Olympic tournament, and they're vying for first place in their group with Britain, which remains undefeated after losing 2-0 to Japan on Thursday.
The British and American teams will meet on Saturday in the final game of the first round.
Both teams will qualify for the quarterfinals, and the result of the game will determine who will take first place in their group of six teams and who will take second.
The winner will avoid a clash with a strong Dutch team, the leaders of the other group, a little later, when the quarterfinals begin.
But Saturday's game shows that the Americans have made a splash here with their surprise series, four years after they finished last out of 12 teams at the London Games.
Bam was on that team.
She grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, first picked up a stick for field hockey when she was 3 (her older twin sisters played the sport at Drexel), and joined the national team at age 16, becoming its youngest player in history.
She missed the 2008 Olympics when she failed to qualify for the final squad.
Then came 2012, when things didn't go well for her and her teammates.
The next year Coeg Parnham, an Englishman, was appointed as coach, and things began to change.
"Cultural change, psychological change, change in physical training", said Bam.
In London, we didn't have the productivity that we have now.
We changed our whole outlook.
Thursday night, Bam opened the scoring in the first half with a short-handed throw.
India went into the match without a single win in the tournament, but the team proved surprisingly tough and held 1-0 until the end of the third period, when Bam took the initiative.
She made a long pass with the ball down the left side of the field, then spiralled into the middle and sent the ball sharply into the goal, thereby giving the Americans a 2-0 advantage.
Melissa Gonzales added the final goal in the middle of the fourth period.
The "dry" victory was the first in the tournament for U.S. goalkeeper Jackie Briggs, who had missed one goal in each of the first three wins.
She's in shock.
So is Bam.
"We're in a good position right now", Parnham said, "but how good it is depends on the result of Saturday's game".
In the midst of the turmoil of the Olympic Games , the day of the jumping jacks on the batute .
Wherever you are, whatever the time is, it's the Olympics.
What happens in Rio de Janeiro seems to be unchanging and inevitable, a frantic combination of competition and aspiration.
It's like the Olympic flame itself is that burning torch that's passed from the archer to the swimmer, to the gymnast, to the triathlete.
You can't turn on the TV, read the newspaper, or eavesdrop on your neighbors in the coffee shop without hearing about Simone Biles, Kathy Ledecky, or the feud between Michael Phelps and Chad De Kloe.
And then there's Logan Dooley.
Dooli, the first-time Olympian, the handsome guy with the dimples on his cheeks, could have been among the celebrities shown in prime time, promoted by sponsors and life-affirming commercials, had he been a swimmer, a gymnast or even a fencing champion.
But 28-year-old Dooley of Lake Forest, California, is fighting for the Olympic gold in the pole vault.
The Olympic flame does not illuminate all events in the same way.
Farther from the center, partly in the shadows, are the sports that are not universally recognized: air pistol shooting, archery, badminton, taekwondo.
Brass will always be with us, long live his reign.
But if I may be so bold as to speak in defense of my own personal bias, let me draw your attention to the modest charm of trampoline jumping.
Although trampolining has been an Olympic sport since 2000, when it debuted at the Sydney Games, it has received so little recognition over the past 16 years that many of the people I interviewed were unaware that it was an Olympic sport at all.
It could be regional ignorance.
Although the United States sent athletes to the competition, they never won a medal in the high jump, and their athletes did not reach the final until 2012.
The Chinese and Russians usually share the male awards, and the Chinese and Canadians share the female awards.
China's Dun Dun and Canada's Rosie McLennan will defend their London gold medals this year.
But trampoline jumping has an outsider's charm, in part because it's more like a circus school to the uninformed than an Olympic event.
I have to admit that I'm not an expert, but a down-to-earth enthusiast.
They do have a comic potential -- the cartoonish chatter of endless jumps -- but also the grace of gymnastics and diving, two sports that they mostly combine.
The word "trampoline" comes from the Spanish word "el trampolín", meaning "trampoline for jumping into the water".
The contestants jump on a giant trampoline, soaring nearly 30 feet into the air, and must perform a series of acrobatic tricks (turns, bends, and jumps) before finally landing on their feet.
They are judged on performance, complexity and "flight time", according to the official Olympic Games program.
Thirty-two athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women, will compete in Rio.
The most common Olympic course is forward.
The medal contenders must go further, faster, higher and higher in the chase for gold, sometimes to the finish line, and sometimes back and forth, back and forth across the field.
They're not just aiming for the finish line or the starting line, but also, as seen on TV, for another teasing boundary: the world or Olympic record.
This perseverance is noble, admirable, even fanatical, and it's enough to make even the viewer shed tears.
But it's a little bit of a drag, I think, when you're watching the games.
It's a good break from trampoline jumping.
The direction of the batist is upwards.
Moving forward is not the goal.
He or she jumps up, seems weightless, like an astronaut, flies up, then down, then effortlessly back up again.
And they're not without competition or difficulty, but there's no crazy zeal for the finish line, no long jumps, just a strange, graceful disappearance of time and gravity throughout the program.
It's the closest thing to Zen to an Olympic sport.
The women's qualifying competition, and then the final, will be held on Friday afternoon, broadcast at 1pm Eastern European time; the men's competition will be broadcast on Saturday, also at 1pm.
NBC will broadcast the final as part of the daytime schedule beginning at 2:00 p.m. both days.
In the midst of the Olympic madness, a calm, beautiful moment awaits, easily seen in the general dump.
And if consciousness can only be achieved by subjecting male athletes to the lustful gazes and objectification that, according to the Wall Street Journal, male gymnasts in the United States have recently suggested, Doolittle is just waiting for her new adoring crowd.
A generation of protestors in Ethiopia, a long-time ally of the US
Violent protests in Ethiopia
Protesters demanding political change in Ethiopia have faced fierce opposition from the government.
Witnesses say dozens of protesters were mortally wounded during clashes with police.
Is Ethiopia really on the verge of breaking up?
In the last decade, it has been one of the most stable countries in Africa, a staunch ally of the West with a rapidly developing economy.
But in recent months, anti-government protests have rocked the country, spreading to a growing number of its territories.
In the last week alone, thousands of people have taken to the streets to demand radical political change.
Human rights activists say the government's response has been brutal.
Witnesses claimed that police officers shot dozens of unarmed protesters.
Video footage from the protests, believed to have been taken late last year or early this year, shows security officers beating young men with sticks after they were handcuffed to the wall.
The United Nations' top human rights official is now calling for a thorough investigation.
"It has always been difficult to keep this country from collapsing, and it will be even more difficult", said Rashid Abdi, head of the Horn of Africa Project at the International Crisis Research Group.
Ethiopia is Africa's second most populous country after Nigeria, and its stability is supported by the West.
The US military and intelligence services are working closely with the Ethiopians to combat terrorist threats in the region, especially in Somalia, and virtually no country in Africa receives such support from the West.
Ethiopia's economy is growing at an impressive rate.
Its infrastructure has improved significantly  there is even a new commuter train in the capital Addis Ababa.
And its streets are generally quiet, safe, and clean.
However, Ethiopia was hardly a model democracy  Human rights organizations constantly mention the government's repression - opposition on the territory of the state was suppressed, at the expense of effectively silencing dissidents.
Many were exiled, imprisoned, killed, or banished to remote deserts.
But that could change.
"If people are constantly suppressed and given no other option than to protest, an uprising will arise", said Seyoum Teshome, a lecturer at a university in central Ethiopia.
All the young people are protesting.
The generation is protesting.
The complaints range from land use to the seizure of power by a government coalition.
After last year's widely criticized elections, the ruling party and its allies have completely ousted the opposition and now control 100 percent of the Parliament.
At the same time, tensions are rising along the border with Eritrea; fighting over this unclear, disputed border claimed hundreds of lives in June.
Analysts fear that separatist groups that have been more or less wiped out in recent years, such as the Oromo Liberation Front or the Ogaden National Liberation Front, may try to use the unrest to rearm.
A number of factors explain why bitter feelings that have been simmering for years now flare up.
The first is a seemingly harmless one: smartphones.
Only in the last couple of years have more and more Ethiopians been able to communicate on social media as cheap smartphones became commonplace and internet access became better.
Even when governments block access to Facebook and Twitter, as is often the case, especially during protests, many people still find ways to communicate through proxy servers that hide their location.
Several young Ethiopians said that this is how they organized their protests.
The second is that there is more solidarity between the Oromo and the Amhara, the two largest Ethiopian ethnic groups.
The Oromo and the Amhara are not natural allies.
For centuries, Amharas from the predominantly Christian highland regions of Ethiopia have prospered in politics and business, exploiting the Oromo, many of whom are Muslims and live in the lowland areas.
But it's also changing.
"We will act together under a common principle", said Mulattu Gemechu, the Oromo leader.
The largest protests took place in the districts of Amhara and Oromo.
Many Amhara and Oromo feel that Ethiopia is unfairly dominated by members of the Tigray ethnic group, which makes up about 6 percent of the population and controls the military and intelligence services, commerce and politics.
The third cause of the unrest is the loss of Meles Zenawi.
Meles, a former rebel leader, served as prime minister of Ethiopia for 17 years until his death from an unknown illness in 2012.
He was considered a tactical genius, a man who could foresee danger.
Analysts say he was particularly adept at detecting early signals of discontent and using intelligence to gather information and disable opponents.
"The current regime lacks common sense", said Abdi, a conflict analyst.
The new Prime Minister of Ethiopia, Hailemarieam Desalegne, appeared out of nowhere and took over from Meles.
Unlike Meles, who was from the Tigray region of northern Ethiopia, Haile Mariam was a southerner.
Analysts say he doesn't have the confidence of the security services controlled by the Tigers.
Many fear that this will result in even more bloodshed.
The last time Ethiopia experienced such unrest was in 2005, after thousands of people protested against what analysts said appeared to be an election that the government rigged and then rigged.
The ensuing crackdown killed many Protestants, though in fewer numbers than in recent months, and the period of unrest passed relatively quickly.
Development experts commended Ethiopian leaders for their visionary infrastructure development, such as a new intercity train, and significant progress in the fight against poverty.
But it clearly did not stop the growth of internal discontent with the Ethiopian government.
And it takes on a dangerous ethnic form.
Last month, protesters in Gondar, a city in Amhara, attacked businesses owned by the Tigers, and anti-Tigri hatred on social media is becoming all-encompassing.
Analysts say the protesters are putting the United States and other Western allies in a difficult position.
The U.S. government has used Ethiopia as a base for unmanned flights over neighboring Somalia, though it recently announced it was shutting down the base.
On the one hand, it's clear that the West wants to support democracy, but on the other hand, it doesn't want its ally to lose power in an already unstable region.
"And this tightrope will be hard to pass", Abdi said.
Donald Trump explains his statement that ISIS was founded by Obama, "sarcasm"
Donald J. Trump tried to defuse the latest controversy engulfing his campaign headquarters on Friday, claiming he was joking when he said several times this week that President Obama and Hillary Clinton were "founders" of the terrorist group Islamic State.
The clarification raised new questions about the Republican presidential candidate's ability to speak intelligibly to the American people.
It also embarrassed his deputies, who had tried to protect him during the turmoil, by having to explain away statements he probably did not mean.
Making this assumption at the convention on Wednesday night, Trump insisted strongly on his claim on Thursday, reiterating in an interview that he really meant to say that the president and Clinton founded ISIS.
But in a tweet early Friday morning, Trump said he was just being a jerk.
The post was the exact opposite of the claim made just a day earlier, when Trump stated in several interviews that he was absolutely serious about his accusation.
When conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt tried to help Trump soften his tone by reminding him that Obama wants to destroy ISIS, the Republican presidential candidate missed the opportunity.
The latest scandal erupted when Trump tried to refocus his campaign on the economy amid a slump in the ratings.
Trump and Clinton gave competing speeches on the economy in Michigan this week.
On Friday, Trump tried to return to the topic.
Again, he took to Twitter to warn that Clinton's plans would lead to higher taxes, and said he found her speech boring.
Trump has used sarcasm as an excuse before.
In late July, after he drew widespread criticism for basically voicing the idea that the Russians should hack Clinton's email, he later explained his remarks by saying, "Of course, I'm joking".
This approach allows Trump to go beyond the bounds of political speech and take back what he said when necessary.
"I think it's his way of testing out the messages that are resonating among his fans, seeing how they act, and then 'explaining' them one way or another depending on the reaction", said Ruth Sherman, a communication expert who analyzed the language of both candidates.
But I also think he's careful about what he says and knows that they're vague enough to be interpreted differently.
Instead of softening his remarks to the broader electorate, Trump has taken an even more poignant tone in recent days as his ratings continue to fall.
A new NBC/Wall Street Journal/Marist poll released Friday showed Trump trailing Clinton by a wide margin in North Carolina, Virginia and Colorado and on a par with her in Florida.
While Trump generally tries not to apologize for the provocative things he says, he often accuses his critics of misinterpreting his words and misunderstanding his sense of humor.
But as Trump has become the focus of increased attention in the final months of the presidential campaign, his jokes have put his loyal allies in an awkward position of having to publicly support him, no matter how provocative his rhetoric.
Rudolph W. Giuliani, the former mayor of New York City who is one of Trump's most prominent deputy, went to great lengths to defend the candidate in an interview with CNN on Thursday.
"I think what he's saying is acceptable political commentary", Giuliani said when asked about the credibility of Trump's claim that Obama and Clinton founded the Islamic State.
This is true in the sense that before Obama, ISIS was a little unknown organization, he called it a non-threat, totally unfair, and that's why it happened, because he pulled out of Iraq.
Most moderate Republicans say that the Obama administration, with Clinton as secretary of state, allowed ISIS to grow because it failed to crack down on the Middle East.
Before the rally in Pennsylvania on Friday, Trump continued to attack the media on Twitter for misrepresenting and biasing his every word.
He mocked the "poor wretched" television pundits who were trying to figure him out, and said, "They're weak!"
Some Democrats have ridiculed Trump's excuses as further evidence that he's unfit to be president.
Once a displaced coffeehouse returns to Greenpoint .
The Verve Cafe was a run-down, cash-only place in Williamsburg that didn't have Wi-Fi, but served good coffee for 15 years.
Naturally, she was forced out of her window-sitting on Bedford Avenue.
Soap Sheri, which replaced Verbe in the summer of 2014, sells soap in the form of cupcakes.
The locals mourned her as the last loss in a city under renovation.
Artist Molly Krabappel tweeted, "New York is constantly changing, I know, but I still can't believe CBGB is dead, the Chelsea Hotel is destroyed, and the Verve is now a soap store".
But while New York is constantly changing, it is also constantly being renewed.
The revived Verb Coffee opened last November in Greenpoint, less than a mile north of the original location.
The new Verbe has Wi-Fi and accepts credit cards, but it still has some of the same staff and a similarly simple atmosphere.
And the coffee's still good.
The new Verba is headed by Sisko Rodriguez, a longtime employee of the old coffee shop who is the owner and general manager at the new location.
He started working at the Verbe in 2001 and stayed there until the end.
When one of his clients offered to sponsor him for a new place, he said he'd be happy to do it.
Rodriguez, 36, has kept a lot of things the same.
The Verve works with the same distributor of bagels and bought the same model of coffee machine.
It even has a chandelier from the old "Sparrow".
But Rodriguez said he wanted to experiment, too.
He suggested new dishes.
The menu includes bacon, egg and cheese sandwiches, and capers or fried onion toppings are available.
There's brown rice.
The coffee shop no longer serves beer, but now it does freshly squeezed juices.
Nine months later, Rodriguez said he noticed a steady stream of old regulars.
"Many former clients were also squeezed out of Williamsburg prices",  he shared.
On a recent Sunday, Rebecca Oliveira was one of those clients.
Oliveira, who is 34 years old, used to live in Williamsburg and frequented the Verbe.
Even after she moved to Greenpoint, she still went there.
After the Verba closed, she said she stopped drinking coffee for a while.
"I realized that it was the coffee and the atmosphere that impressed me in Verbe", she said.
Now she's drinking coffee again, though that day she ordered a cup of tea instead of her usual iced coffee, another novelty.
Tom Rosenthal, another longtime client, has been a loyal subscriber to The Verbe since 2003.
He would come in before work and order the same thing over and over again.
"At fifteen o'clock every day, like clockwork, I would come in and have my bagel with butter and all the stuffing made for me", he said.
Rodriguez said he wanted to experiment and added new dishes to the menu.
Today, Rosenthal still makes the usual order, but one day he'll change things up with bacon, eggs or cheese on a bagel with all the toppings.
Rodriguez said he wasn't upset that the soap store took over the old place.
Moreover, the owners of Soap Sherry proposed making a special soap for the Verb using coffee from a coffee pot prepared in the cold as an ingredient.
"I think we might agree to their offer", Rodriguez said.
The permanent residents of Greenpoint of Polish origin also favored this coffee house.
One of these new customers translated the menu into Polish, and Rodriguez said he planned to find a place for it in the shop window so his new neighbors would feel welcome.
There are other benefits to being in a new place.
A local juice store plans to bottle and sell cold brew coffee.
There's a chance that the coffee shop will be joined by the next building.
For many customers, the new Verve will be enough to include their favorite dishes on the menu.
Joseph Whitt was a regular and shared that he was devastated when they closed.
When the coffee shop opened at its new location, Witt said that going in and ordering a cup of coffee made him feel like he was coming home.
"How I've longed to smell that aroma", he confessed.
The depressing food of depression in "Fat Meal"
In March 1933, shortly after his ascension to the presidency, Franklin Delano Roosevelt sat down to lunch in the Oval Office.
As a gourmet, President Roosevelt loved the fashions of Fifth Avenue, like foie gras and Maryland turtle soup.
His menu that day was more modest: stuffed eggs in tomato sauce, mashed potatoes, and dessert of plum pudding.
"It was an act of culinary solidarity with people who were suffering",  Jane Ziegelmann said.
Her husband, Andrew Coe, added: "It was also a message to the American people about how to eat".
The couple, who live in Brooklyn Heights, are experts in the history of food.
Coa's last book, "Ragu in Chinese", was about Chinese cuisine in America, and Ziegelmann told the story of living in a rental apartment on the Lower East Side through food in her book "House 97 on Fruit Garden Street".
Their new collaborative work, "Fully Eaten", to be published Tuesday by Harper, is a history of American food during the Great Depression.
In a show of some sort of culinary solidarity, they met the reporter for dinner at Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop, a tiny, off-the-grid diner in the Flatiron Quarter that's been open since 1929, the year of the stock market crash.
Siegelman, 54, ordered a cream cheese and olive sandwich, and Coe, 57, took a turkey, mashed potatoes and a vegetable mixture.
When the reporter ordered the meat roll, the couple thought it was a good starting point for a discussion about food during the Depression.
"Rollers were in great demand", said Siegelman.
There was the peanut roulette, the baking roulette, the bean roulette.
They were made from the basic ingredient and cheap products that allowed the ingredient to stretch.
Imagine that you've eaten as many peanuts as you need for dinner.
Coe has a wrinkle.
"He must have been lying in his stomach with a stone", he said.
In the years before the Depression, the American table, especially in rural areas, was a buffet table.
Groups of women cooked for the men who worked the farm, and the freshly baked pie was served for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.
It was the Americans who sent food to starving Europeans during World War I. "Thin Meal" describes how the country coped with suddenly ceasing to be a country of plenty.
"This was a time when food became a central, difficult topic for Americans", said Coe, explaining why he and his wife decided to write about it.
The new budget diet was no less difficult: mysterious dishes such as roulettes and pastries became staples; pastries were "a wonderful way to dispose of waste", Siegelmann noted, because cooks could hide unappetizing ingredients under a thick layer of sauce.
Fresh fruit was replaced by cheaper dried fruit.
Meat, for many years the staple of American food, has become a frugal luxury.
People have tried strange mixtures because energy and nutritional value have become more important than taste and even culinary common sense.
While researching for a book that includes recipes, Siegelman prepared a dish of the era: baked onions, stuffed with peanut butter.
"This addition to the dining table was not successful",  said.
Siegelman added: "It was very strange".
Peanut butter is totally out of place with baked onions.
This was typical of many household recipes.
As never before and never since, the experts in the home -- including Louise Stanley, head of the Federal Home Office from 1923 to 1943 -- have been running the country's food habits.
Publishing recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines, they advised women to become "budget makers", to take the challenge and to transform the scrambled spaghetti-carrot burdock into delicious dishes.
The "Full Table" is a feast of curious historical facts.
Especially poignant are the stories of government response to starving citizens, such as President Herbert Hoover's "let them eat pies" stance.
Publicly boasting of the simple Iowa farm life of his childhood, he ate like the sophisticated millionaire he became.
"He liked continental cuisine, like fish with cucumber sauce",  told Coe.
He ate practically in the gold-plated dining room, wearing a tuxedo.
He was fantastically detached from reality.
President Roosevelt might have made the same mistake if his wife Eleanor hadn't advised him to set an example with his own stomach.
The book says that Eleanor Roosevelt hired a housekeeper who was completely uninterested in taste, and this led to the White House "consuming not only the most dreary food in Washington, but sometimes the most disgustingly prepared food".
Many of the Depression-era cooking techniques were forgotten once the country got back on its feet.
Their legacy is our constant focus on calories and nutrition, says Siegelman, and how science has been used in cooking.
The couple said that during the writing of the book they understood better the eating habits of Ziegelmann's mother  that she could not throw away food, for example.
"She was seriously afraid of the sloppy approach to food", said Coe.
Siegelman recalled: "She was seriously poisoning people".
There was an unfortunate incident with the propellers.
When the plates at Eisenberg's ran out, he and Coe got a dessert they made at home: the prune dessert that President Roosevelt had for lunch.
"It's called black-liam mousse", Siegelman said, adding that it was a common practice to give humble recipes catchy names.
There was no whipped cream, just prune, some flour, sugar, water and cinnamon.
All of them reluctantly dipped a spoon into a viscous, brown, sticky substance.
Surprisingly, it was not bad.
Kow asked for more twice.
In the voice of a confident budget-maker, he said to his wife: "A little chopped walnuts would be nice".
The arrest of the defendants in the mass brawl at the Hovan cemetery has been extended until November 14
The Presnensk court has kept the defendants in the case of the mass fight at the Khovan cemetery under arrest until November 14, satisfying the corresponding request of the investigation.
There are 14 people on the case.
Recall that on May 14, a mass brawl of several hundred people from Central Asia and the North Caucasus with the use of weapons occurred at the Khovan cemetery, as a result of which three people were killed.
The former head of the cemetery Yuri Chabuev and the lawyer, co-founder of the public organization "Healthy Nation" Alexander Bocharnikov were charged with organizing the murder.
The second indexation of pensions for 2016 could be resolved within the next two to three weeks.
This was reported on August 12 by Deputy Chairman of the Government of the Russian Federation Olga Golodec during a visit to the Bryansk region.
We have set specific parameters for how much you need to raise the pension in order to bring down the inflation that exists in the country.
All the calculations are done.
Economists are now summing up the results of the first half of the year, and we will complete this work within the next two or three weeks", quoted Interfax by Golodets.
Commenting on the scheme proposed by the head of the Center for Strategic Developments Alexei Kudrin to raise the retirement age by six months every year, the vice-premier said that the cabinet does not consider this topic.
In late July, it became known that the Government had agreed on a position on the full indexation of pension payments in 2017.
Kamensky and Grigoryan reached the final of the competition in shooting from a small-caliber rifle.
Russian athletes Sergei Kamensky and Kirill Grigoryan made it to the finals of the small-caliber rifle shooting event at the Olympic Games in Brazil.
As reported by TASS, Sergei Kamensky scored 629 points and took first place - a new Olympic record in the qualifying.
Kirill Grigoryan was second - 628,9 was.
In total, eight of the best athletes advanced to the finals.
Kamensky is the world record holder in this discipline (633).
Turkish oppositionist Fethullah Gülen demands an international investigation into the circumstances of the attempted coup in Turkey.
"I demand that an independent international commission investigate the coup attempt", Gulen was quoted as saying by the French newspaper Le Monde.
The Turkish opposition leader also stated that "if any part of the accusations are confirmed, I will return to Turkey".
However, Gülen has strongly denied any involvement in the coup, stressing that his organization has never claimed political power.
The Istanbul court had earlier arrested opposition Islamic preacher Fethullah Gulen in absentia.
The attempted military coup took place in Turkey on the night of July 15th.
Gilead will pay for the legal fees of Merck's Hepatitis C patent dispute.
Gilead Sciences Inc is entitled to reimbursement of legal fees it has incurred in a patent litigation over a hepatitis C drug with drug maker Merck & Co Inc, a federal district judge ruled.
In June, Gilead was released from paying $200 million in damages for infringing two Merck patents related to Gilead's drugs, sales leaders Sovaldi and Harvoni, after an American judge found a number of violations by Merck, including perjury and other unethical conduct.
In a filing Thursday, U.S. District Judge Beth Labson Freeman said Gilead has the right to recover the costs incurred in litigation.
Merck is trying to catch up with Gilead, which dominates the market for a new generation of hepatitis C drugs that can cure more than 90 percent of liver disease patients.
The case occurred in 2013, when Gilead and Merck sued each other for their rights to the lab work that underlies sofosbuvir, the active ingredient in Gilead's drugs.
US-backed forces claim to have wrested full control of Manbij from the Islamic State
US-backed forces have seized full control of the northern city of Manbij near the Turkish border after the last remaining Islamic State fighters in the city left, a spokesman for the group said on Friday.
The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) are now clearing the city after the departure of the remaining group of militants who were hiding in the city.
They have freed more than 2,000 civilian hostages held by militants, Sharfan Darwish of the SDF-allied Manbij Military Council told Reuters.
"The city is now completely under our control, but we are undertaking a cleanup operation", he told Reuters.
Clinton made $10.75 million in 2015 and paid 34.2% of the federal tax rate.
Hillary Clinton on Friday released her 2015 tax returns, which showed that the Democratic presidential candidate and her husband had $10.75 million in income that year and paid an effective federal tax rate of 34.2 percent.
In 2015, the Clintons received $1 million in charitable contributions, mostly to the Clinton Foundation, with former President Bill Clinton receiving about $5.3 million in speaking fees, and the former secretary of state claiming $3 million from Simon & Schuster for her book about her time in the State Department.
Potential Vice President Clinton, U.S. Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia, and his wife Anna Holton, have released their 10-year tax returns.
In 2015, they paid an effective federal tax rate of 20.3 percent.
"Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine continue to set the standard for financial transparency", Jennifer Palmieri, a Clinton campaign adviser, said in a statement.
In stark contrast, Donald Trump is hiding behind a phony excuse and reneging on his past promises to release his tax returns.
It's common for U.S. presidential candidates to release their tax returns, even though the law doesn't require them to do so.
New York businessman Trump and his lawyers cited the IRS audit as the reason for his refusal to release his tax returns.
"Your move", tweeted Clinton campaign adviser Ian Sams, referring to the Democratic nominee's declaration.
On Thursday, Trump special counsel Michael Cohen told CNN that he would not allow Trump to release them until the vetting process was complete.
Trump's critics, including 2012 Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney and other fellow Republicans, said his withdrawal raised questions about his wealth, his charitable contributions, his business dealings and other ties, including with Russia.
Clinton took a swipe at the issue and on Friday released an online video that featured prominent Republicans persuading Trump to release his tax returns.
She brought it up Thursday during a speech on the economy in Michigan.
"He refuses to do what every presidential candidate without exception has done for decades: release his tax returns", she told the audience.
Politico reported that Trump paid no or almost no taxes for two years in the 1990s, and the New York Times business columnist on Friday quoted many tax lawyers and accountants as saying that may still be the case.
Federal tax rates have become a point of contention in the presidential election.
Clinton backed a rule named after billionaire investor Warren Buffett that would have guaranteed that people earning more than $1 million a year would pay a tax rate of at least 30 percent.
President Barack Obama also supported the proposal.
At a meeting with Clinton last week in Omaha, Nebraska, Buffett, whose Berkshire Hathaway conglomerate is based there, offered to meet Trump and exchange tax returns.
Buffett said he's also under investigation by the IRS, and that Trump is "afraid" not of the tax collection agency, but of voters.
Clinton campaign released tax returns up to 2007.
The Clintons, who now live in Chappaqua, New York, paid an average federal tax rate of about 32 percent from 2007 to 2014 and an effective combined tax rate of about 40.5 percent.
The Clintons' 2015 tax returns showed that, unlike most Americans, only $100 of their income was from salaries.
Their primary investment was a low-cost index mutual fund, and the Clintons reported dividends and capital gains of $109,000.

Chilli powder condoms and fireworks boost Tanzanian elephants' protection
Conservationists in Tanzania are using an unconventional method to prevent elephants from entering the settlements by throwing condoms filled with chili powder at them.
The method has proven effective, and the Honeyguide Foundation, which came up with the idea a few years ago, has partnered with the American Committee for the Protection of Nature to take the initiative to promote it, training volunteers in the villages of northern Tanzania to use a non-violent, four-step method to protect their homes and crops without harming the animals.
In the past, many people used spears to protect themselves.
Friday is World Elephant Day, dedicated to animal protection.
"Since we invented the toolkit ..., we have seen a change of attitude within these communities, with the result that they are much more confident that they can keep elephants out of their fields without harming the elephants",  said Honeyguide CEO Damian Bell in a statement.
The first two steps are to light the torch in front of the elephant that has crossed the border and to signal the elephant with the horn.
If it is not deterred, a so-called "chilli cloud" is thrown.
The chili powder mixed with the soil is placed with the cotton ball in a condom, and the end is twisted, leaving only the wick outside.
When ignited, the condom bursts with a loud noise, spraying tiny specks of chili powder into the air.
A single blow is usually enough to turn an elephant the other way.
The ultimate measure  is a launching device that shoots Roman candles into the air, producing a loud, bright explosion.
Turkey has still not returned 32 Turkish diplomats who left the country after the coup attempt in July this year.
This was stated by the Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu in a conversation with local journalists.
In the first phase, we recalled 208 staff diplomats to continue their work at the center.
Of these, 32 people did not return for no objective reason or explanation", said the head of the Turkish foreign policy department.
In July, there was an attempted coup in Turkey.
The country's authorities officially declared that the coup had failed, and reported the detention of over six thousand people, including military ranks of the upper and middle ranks.
The coup attempt killed 290 people, according to the Turkish Foreign Ministry.
Jewish director sharply criticizes Berlin hotel for removing Israeli phone code at "request" of Arabs  RT News channel reports
The French director of Jewish origin caused a media scandal when he discovered that the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin does not have an Israeli phone number, and that the staff refer to "requests" from Arab customers.
Claude Lanzmann, the author of the Holocaust documentary film Shoah, expressed his displeasure with the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin by writing an open letter to the German FAZ media.
During his recent stay at the hotel, Lutzman tried to find Israel in the phone code list provided by the hotel.
The country, however, was not listed among the countries that could be called directly from the room.
How could it be that in 2016 in Berlin, the capital of the new Germany, Israel was excluded and eradicated?
It's by Lanzmann.
In return, Kempinski Bristol provides the ability to dial Israel through its own call center.
In search of an explanation, the director raised the issue with the hotel management.
The response he received there, according to Lutzman, "shocked him".
The hotel clerk said the move was "a deliberate decision by the management of the Kempinski hotel chain".
The reason behind this move has caused even more anger from the director.
"Most of our guests are Arabs, and they demanded that the Israeli code be removed", Lantzman, the hotel's clerk, said.
Israel's ambassador to Germany, Jacob Hadas-Handelsman, called the case "a terrible disgrace", reports the newspaper Suddeutsche Zeitung.
We were shocked and shocked by the incident.
It's a terrible shame, really.
That this happened in Germany and in this particular hotel chain is an even greater disgrace.
There's no need to explain.
We expect the hotel to make the right conclusions", the official said.
The incident caused quite a stir on the Internet; people called it a scandal.
Some claimed that the Kempinski Hotel had simply "gone to the extreme" in the supposed demands of the Arab customers.
"Shame on us", another post said, noting that the hotel, located on the famous Kurfurstendamm street, is next to the synagogue.
The hotel itself has quickly rebuffed any accusations, calling the incident "inspection" and "apologizing" to Lantzman, Der Spiegel reports.
"There was no direct order not to include Israel in the fast-track list",  the Suddeutsche Zeitung quotes a representative of the Kempinski Hotel as saying.
She adds that the code has now been added.
Police use tear gas and rubber bullets against protesting Brazilian students
Students clashed with police in the Brazilian city of São Paulo on Thursday as they gathered to protest against government reforms to the public education system.
Police used tear gas and rubber bullets against the protesters.
The riots began when police officers tried to disperse the students, resulting in the police using rubber bullets and tear gas.
Several hundred students took part in the demonstration to express their concern about the plans.
Under the proposals of the governor of São Paulo state, Geraldo Alckmin, nearly 100 public high schools will be closed and 300,000 students will be redistributed to save money.
Some of the protesters could be seen behind graffiti against acting president Michael Temer.
This latest protest comes just days after protesters took to the streets to support ousted President Dilma Rousseff when the Senate voted to impeach her.
Trade between Russia and Iran increased by 71 percent , RT Business reports
Since the sanctions were lifted, trade between Moscow and Tehran has increased by 70.9 percent compared to the previous year, according to Russia's ambassador to Iran, Levan Dzhagaryan.
With international sanctions against Iran lifted, there is a growing interest from Russian firms to do business in the country, the ambassador said.
Russian companies are re-engaging with Iran, and new firms are ready to gain access to the market.
Of course, further expansion of trade is one of the main priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran",  said Dzhagaryan.
He noted that in the first five months of 2016, the trade turnover between Russia and Iran increased by 70.9 percent compared to the same period in 2015 and amounted to $856 million.
In particular, Russian exports to Iran grew by 91.5% to $697 million.
Russian imports from Iran increased by 16 percent, to $158 million.
The increase in trade was achieved through the supply of machinery, land vehicles and weapons", the ambassador said.
Jagaryan also predicts that a record number of Iranian tourists will visit Russia this year.
Last year, the Russian diplomatic mission in Iran issued about 35,000 visas, mostly tourist visas, to Iranian citizens.
In addition, for the first time, Iran has entered the top 20 countries in terms of the number of tourists visiting Russia.
We can say with confidence that last year's record for the number of Iranian tourists visiting Russia will be beaten", he said.
At the same time, relatively few Russians visit Iran, which the ambassador hopes will change.
"I personally recommend visiting the cities of Isfahan, Shiraz and Yazd, which have preserved the monuments of the ancient Persian civilization in good condition", he said.
The state continues to spin the nut in the defense industrial complex.
The reason for dismissal was "systematic failure to fulfill" instructions of the general director of the concern "Almaz-Antey", "lack of work" and "loss of trust".
The head of the NGO for the next three years is appointed Gennady Bendersky.
News of Neskorodov's dismissal only emerged on Thursday evening and did not cause a broad media response.
How can we explain such silence in the face of a massive rearmament of the army?
The Russian leadership probably doesn't want any rumors or negative assumptions to be spread in the public sphere.
This is further proof that the defense industry has a lot of problems and the state does not want to draw attention to them.
The dismissal of Nescarodov is certainly a major event in terms of bringing order to the industry.
NPO "Almaz" is the main enterprise of the concern, which specializes in the production of marine and land-based anti-aircraft missile complexes (ZRK).
Currently, "Almaz" is working on the creation of the "Poliment-Redut" and "Morpheus" missile defense systems, which are planned to be installed on new corvettes, frigates, destroyers and cruisers.
The founder of the Military Russia portal Dmitry Kornev believes that Neskorodov's dismissal was caused by the breach of the deadlines for these projects.
This version is the most logical.
For example, the development of "Morpheus" began in 2007, and the commissioning was supposed to take place in 2013.
The Polymers are to be the main air defense system on the Navy's newest ships.
From the information I'm getting, in the several years of testing, not one truly successful experiment has been done.
However, as far as I can tell, this is not the fault of "Diamond", said Kornev.
The expert fears that the delay with the commissioning of the S-500 missile defense system may occur.
The design work on the project is still not completed, but the first complexes should be delivered to the troops during 2016.
The Ministry of Defense assures that "the work is being carried out according to plan and everything will be completed within the established deadlines", although in 2014 the department acknowledged the existence of problems with the development of the S-500.
It is extremely difficult to assess the professional qualities of Neskorodov, who has been leading the "Diamond" since 2011.
Kornev stated that project deadlines can be both a reason and a reason for dismissal.
According to him, in recent years it has become extremely difficult to obtain information about internal processes in the OPK and plans of the management of enterprises.
The industry has received long-term orders worth tens of billions of rubles, and big money, as is known, loves silence.
Generally, directors of defense companies leave their positions of their own accord, by agreement of the parties or are transferred to another job.
In this case, the suspension was made public, though it didn't get much attention.
This suggests that the head of the "Almaz" was perhaps a figure of the strong and resisted the descending from above "raznarady".
It seems that the government will no longer tolerate such behavior.
Through the hands of the shareholders, it will remove those who prefer to disagree with the instructions of the Ministry of Defense and do not fulfill the tasks assigned.
At the same time, the Russian leadership is trying to punish the managers who have provoked (machinations on the "Zvezda" shipyard).
The President personally pays attention to the problems of the sector.
Vladimir Putin heads the Military-Industrial Commission and periodically holds meetings devoted to rearmament.
The Kremlin protects the ranks of the OPC managers, striving to have a loyal board of directors at hand, who will carry out the orders received from above.
This is far from an ideal policy, but in the face of rampant corruption and the lack of normal competition in the CCP, the state has no other tools.
The situation in the defense is not catastrophic, but the current geopolitical situation is stimulating the Kremlin to put the Armed Forces in order as soon as possible.
In parallel with the "cleaning up" of the managers in the Defense Industrial Corporation, the leadership of the Russian Federation is taking quite successful steps to increase the professionalism of the Russian troops.
The army's personnel structure has acquired a new quality with the arrival of the Minister of Defense Sergei Shoigu.
It seems that the president has adopted the famous saying "If you want peace, prepare for war".
During the Cold War, the military power of the USSR and the nuclear parity achieved in the 1970s led to the conclusion of the Helsinki Pact, which secured Moscow's sphere of influence on the continent.
For all the shortcomings of the bipolar system, it was quite efficient.
The absence of war in Europe and the relative stability of the Middle East have proved this.
The triumph of the "victors" in the cold war eventually turned into the strengthening of international terrorism.
After a series of terrorist attacks in Europe and the United States, there seems to be no peaceful place left in the "civilized world".
Despite the common woes, the West refuses to talk to Russia as an equal partner.
Under these conditions, the only allies of our country are the Navy and the Army.
The strengthening of military power will allow Moscow to defend national interests more effectively and to reach new frontiers of world politics.
Scottishman Callum Skinner races down the finish line, resulting in the British capturing the cycling gold.
Scotland's Callum Skinner raced to triumph in the men's team sprint at the Rio cycling track last night, as the UK team trio defended their 2012 London title.
The 23-year-old native of Glasgow was in the role of the strongest, which his fellow Scotsman Sir Chris Hoy made his own, and the young man proudly made history by rushing across the finish line to snatch victory from the favorite team from New Zealand.
Britain claimed a surprise victory four years ago, winning when Howe claimed a fifth of his six Olympic gold medals.
And they repeated the feat after finishing a modest sixth at the World Track Cycling Championships in London in March, despite the fact that Hoye had since retired.
The issue between Beijing and London was the replacement of the contestant's specialist Jamie Staff.
They did it just in time for Hindes to appear.
Hoya's departure also created a void that Kian Emady and Matt Crampton have tried to fill.
Skinner was the man that the British coaches were looking to, seeing the potential in the Scotsman, which was now realised.
Hindes, Kenny, and Hoey, four-year-old champions, and Skinner, set an Olympic record in the qualifiers, but the record was broken by New Zealand in the first round.
And the British trio won the gold medal match.
Hindes was right behind after his lap, but Kenny pushed the team forward, and Skinner backed up.
The change in strategy was a big part of the transformation, with Hindes driving in more gear to slow down and allow Kenny and, especially, Skinner to keep pace.
Howe watched from his seat as a guest expert for the BBC and caught the gaze of Skinner, Kenny and Hindes as they stepped onto the podium.
"That's a flattering comparison", said Skinner, 23, from Glasgow.
I'm here to do whatever I can to make a name for myself.
We set an Olympic record in the final and beat the world champions.
It was incredible.
There's no better way to win.
After his triumph in London in 2012 alongside Kenny and Hoey, Hindes admitted to deliberately falling onto the track after a bad start.
He later recanted any comment, and there was no way for UK competitors to appeal.
There was no question of that this time in the great victory.
Hinds said, "I felt like I was in London, with all those British flags on the grandstand".
We've all been meeting as a team for the last three months.
We'd lost so many world-class races that winning the Olympics again was just amazing.
It's one event, one gold medal for a country that won seven of the 10 titles in both Beijing and London.
If this is a barometer of progress made in the last five months, then the cyclist has five more successful days ahead of him.
With the form Kenny has shown, it's not out of the realm of possibility that he's repeating the feat of Hoy, winning three Olympic gold medals in one Games.
This would see Kenny  who is exactly 12 years younger than Hoya, who was also born on March 23 (this seems to be a holy day in British sport, which is also the birthday of Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister)  bring his tally to six gold medals and one silver.
It would be just like with Hoya.
Next time, Kenny will compete in the sprint, which starts today and runs for three days.
The 28-year-old from Bolton said: "I'm just enjoying it now.
Team competition is always the best.
You come to win with your comrades.
It's a little lonely to win by yourself, to be honest.
Hindes said, "If he wins two more gold medals, he should get a knighthood".
It was the only medal draw of the day, but there was next good news for Britain.
Sir Bradley Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owen Dull qualified for the fastest four-mile team pursuit race by four.
They finished in 3:51.943.
The world record, set when he won gold in London 2012, is 3:51.659.
The first round and the final (10:42 p.m.) will be held today, the second day of the event, where Wiggins will definitely be the center of attention.
He had a discussion with the stewards yesterday, on the eve of qualifying, when the officials demanded he weigh himself.
In the women's event, which resumes and concludes tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanna Roussel Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald of Milngavy improved the world record with a time of 4:13.260.
Team Britain has come to rely on a powerful cycling team to take ownership of the Olympic middle and earn a bunch of medals.
After truly extraordinary demonstrations of absolute superiority in Beijing and London, expectations have waned in the gradual preparation for Rio.
There was drama on the back burner, not least - the resignation of CTO Shane Sutton in April over accusations of sexism and harassment, and the departures of major figures such as Hoy and Victoria Pendleton.
However, based on the first night's racing at the Velodrome, it seems that Britain's now legendary glory of reaching the top at the right time may be about to be repeated.
The future of the Portland Metallurgical Plant is in jeopardy because of the termination of the electricity contract.
The future of the Portland aluminum plant in Victoria  and the jobs of hundreds of workers  are at risk because the electricity company that supplies the plant, according to one of the plant owners, is going to terminate the supply contract: it is planned that all supply contracts will be terminated.
The move follows the decision earlier this year by the Victorian government not to renew the subsidies that had been provided to support the operation of the plant.
The 20-year fixed-rate subsidy expires in November.
Up to 2,000 jobs could be at risk at the Alcoa plant in Portland.
As many as 2,000 jobs - directly and indirectly - could be at risk from any one closure.
There may also be additional indirect effects, as the steel mill consumes about 10 percent of all the electricity produced in Victoria.
In 2014, Alcoa closed the Point Henry steel plant, which led to the closure of the Anglesey power station last year.
The Portland Alcoa Steel Company is losing money and is in danger of closing.
These actions were the result of years of deliberation about the future of the plant, initially due to the strong position of the Australian dollar, and later due to the price of the plant's products.
AGL, which supplies the large aluminum plant with electricity from its Loy Yang A power plant in Latrobe Valley, said it expected the other three owners would also take steps to terminate the contracts.
The controlling stake in the plant is owned by a short-term joint venture between Alcoa and Alumina, while smaller stakes are held by China's CITIC and Japan's Marubeni Corp.
"AGL expects the Portland facility to continue operating, meaning that the physical demand for electricity from the steel plant will not cease",  she stated.
According to AGL, the contracts in question are so-called 'hedged contracts' that were to have come into force in November 2016.
The contracts have a 12-month notice period, so they will actually expire in 2017.
"Accordingly, AGL still expects these contracts to contribute to its revenue share in fiscal 2017", the utility company said.
Any potential impact on AGL's earnings from FY 2018 is currently limited by strong electricity wholesale futures market forecasts.
AGL said it had already reduced the contracts in its reporting by $187 million in the face of "imminent termination".
According to Alcoa, the decision to terminate the contracts "does not affect Alcoa's ability to operate the steel plant or provide electricity to the steel plant".
The US company said it had signed a 20-year contract with Loy Yang in 2010, which was due to come into effect in November this year, but it has yet to explain why it terminated the contract.
Analysts feared the possible closure of both the Portland Steel Plant in Victoria and the Tomaga Works near Newcastle due to the unfavourable economic situation in the industry.
Speaking to analysts earlier this week, AGL chief operating officer Steven Mickelson said that Portland uses about 600 megawatts of energy annually, and that Tomago uses about 900 megawatts.
If both of these plants go out of business, there's going to be a significant decline in demand.
For us as a producer, it would be bad", he said.
Not only is the reality star Kardashian, Kendall is on the cover of Vogue's September issue.
Kendall Jenner, 20, a model and the fourth daughter of the Kardashian-Jenner clan of mother-manager Chris, appeared on the September cover of American Vogue.
Kendall, who is the face of the Estee Lauder brand and has walked the runway at fashion weeks in Milan, Paris and New York, announced the news on her Instagram account on Thursday.
"In the room with my loved ones, I looked at this cover and cried", Kendall wrote.
The cover story was accompanied by a bizarre (or just like the Kardashians?) reality video in which the Kardashian-Jenner family (Rob and Kaitlyn, who were also joined by their favorite show-business uncle, the Kardashian Family producer Ryan Seacrest) forgot about the sister's appearance on the cover, and then the classic twist: they planned a surprise party.
This is the standard plot line for almost every episode of a children's television show dedicated to a birthday (Scream's line, "Did you think we forgot about you?" with the sincerity of the cartoon rabbit from the 8 a.m. show), but Chris needed to get that glory to other girls somehow.
Because with this September issue of Vogue, we have certainly entered a new era of the Kardashian show.
While the older sister Kendall Kim has been on the cover of Vogue before (she appeared on it with her husband Kanye West in April 2014), the September cover is an achievement in itself.
The September issue is the best-selling Vogue issue of the year.
The magazine is more like a gift edition than a fashion magazine, and attracts a huge number of advertisers (according to Fashionista, 615 pages of last year's 832-page edition contained advertising).
News of which of the stars will be featured on the cover is so eagerly awaited that in the last two years, the magazine's photos have been leaking before the official announcement.
Previous women on the cover include Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista, and Kate Moss.
In recent years, there have certainly been more "celebrities who work as models" on the cover than "models who are celebrities".
Oscar winner and Dior brand face Jennifer Lawrence was featured on the cover in 2013, a year after that honor went to Lady Gaga.
But even in the unlikely event that Jenner, who the magazine described as "the outstanding model" of her generation, falls into the first category, she's in good company.
These celebrities are not relatives of famous people, reality stars, or modern kids who know how to make a good video on Snapchat (although Jenner falls into all of these categories).
These are really talented women who are making it in the entertainment industry.
For Beyoncé, who appeared on the cover last year, this year was one of the most successful in her career with the release of the album Lemonade.
Of course, not everyone is happy about Jenner's success.
Jenner's standing in the fashion world, given her past as a reality TV star, was always going to remain shaky.
In June, Victoria's Secret model Stephanie Seymour criticized Jenner and her colleague Gigi Hadid, calling them "bitches of the moment".
The mood was heightened again by news of Jenner's appearance on the cover of Vogue.
But there's no point in dwelling on the unhappiness.
Kendall Jenner on the cover of the September issue of Vogue.
She is a supermodel in every sense of the word.
She's running for Marc Jacobs.
She's selling you a tonic from Estee Lauder.
She, and all her sisters, sell you their photos on their own apps, available on a paid subscription.
She's selling her daughter Cindy Crawford's handmade photographs to LOVE magazine.
And in her spare time, perhaps to keep up with her sister Courtney and her children, she is a reality TV star.
Public legal centers refuse to serve 160,000 people a year
Every year, more than 160,000 of the most vulnerable people are denied access to public legal services as the sector prepares for the effects of further cuts in funding for already-extenuating activities.
In Queensland, three in five people - mainly the elderly, immigrants, vulnerable workers, victims of violence, people who have no means to fight unjust dispossession and so on - have already been denied free legal aid and representation.
Public legal services, already operating beyond capacity, are preparing for further cuts.
Starting next June, these law centers are to lose another 30 percent of their federal funding.
James Farrell, director of the Queensland Community Law Centres, said that according to the latest census report from the National Association of Community Law Centres, thousands of people are being turned away every year.
Farrell said if the federal government doesn't reverse its decision, it's only gonna get worse.
"The Queensland community legal centres are consistently underfunded: this means that thousands of people are denied the vital services they need", he said.
People leaving abusive relationships, people with unmanageable and devastating debts, families going through divorce, workers being unfairly fired -- all of these people have legal problems, and this report shows that they can't get the help they need.
The federal government will cut funding by 30 percent from June 2017, leaving thousands of Queensland's most vulnerable people to deal with complex legal issues on their own.
We call on the Minister of Justice and Queensland Senator George Brandeis to immediately cancel these funding cuts so that people can get the help they need when they face legal problems.
Last year, the state government fulfilled its commitment to raise free legal aid funding to the national average.
Now is the time to address the needs of community legal centres and communities, their clients, and the Palastnik government to invest in this important work.
Donald Trump's campaign headquarters has been sued after a staffer allegedly threatened him with a gun.
Donald Trump's campaign headquarters in New York City is reportedly being sued for allegedly not taking action after reports that his chief operating officer in North Carolina threatened an employee with a gun while they were riding in a jeep in February.
The incident was described in a lawsuit filed Wednesday in state court in Charlotte by Vincent Bordini, a former software instructor at the state's campaign headquarters.
Bordini said he waited months for the issue to be resolved internally, but realized "it's not going to happen".
Director Earl Phillip "took out his pistol, put his right index finger on the trigger and aimed the gun at Vincent's kneecap",  Bordinie claims in the complaint.
After complaining to the local and regional election headquarters, Bordini realized that at least four other people had been involved in similar incidents with Phillip, the appeal states.
"Pistols do not have to fire to cause damage", Bordinini said in his complaint.
The lawsuit came just two days after the Republican presidential candidate caused a stir by telling North Carolina audiences that "Second Amendment people" - meaning gun owners and his cronies - could act if his rival Hillary Clinton was elected and could choose the justices.
Trump's campaign said that the media had taken his words out of context and that he had not spoken out in support of violence.
In his complaint, Bordini demands compensation from the campaign headquarters for negligent control, and from Philippe for the threat of physical violence, insulting actions and causing moral harm.
Trump spokesman Hope Hicks is slow to respond to a request for comment.
Attempts to talk to Phillip were unsuccessful.
WCCB, the local news partner in Charlotte, reports that Phillip recently left the campaign.
When I called his consulting firm, Innovative Consulting Services, no one called back.
Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has run a controversial campaign.
The case is Bordinini v. Donald J. Trump for President Inc., 16-CS-14300, U.S. District Court for the District of Mecklenburg, Charlotte.
Britain must channel the Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow
Heathrow will also bring revival and prosperity not only to our communities here and London in general, but to the whole country.
I think that's been a huge advantage for Heathrow, just like it was for London 2012, where we've done everything we can to make sure that our people and our regions benefit from the Games.
The Olympics have been a huge boon to Stratford and the East End.
And we'll do it again by creating opportunities for local people and businesses around Heathrow.
For our communities here alone, we're going to create 10,000 new internships, 40,000 new jobs, and end youth unemployment around the airport.
Just as it was before London 2012, there will be those who think the task of expanding Heathrow is too big.
I was told that Britain would never be ready for the Olympics, and that we would be in a difficult position on the world stage.
The skeptics were wrong in 2012, and they'll be proven wrong about Heathrow.
There are always obstacles to overcome, but Heathrow answers any question about him.
Like the Olympic Games in Heathrow, it's an infrastructure project for the many, not just for the few.
Expansion is the opportunity to create up to 180,000 new jobs, £211 billion of economic growth, leaving a legacy of skills and employment both around the airport and across the UK.
We have a great team at Heathrow, who have implemented a £11 billion infrastructure investment programme on time and on budget, from T5  voted the best airport terminal for five years in a row, to T2, built in the middle of the world's two busiest runways.
Now they're ready to provide a third runway, backed by 16 billion pounds of private investment.
The London 2012 Olympics was a huge success for the UK, and I'm sure the Heathrow expansion will be too.
It's time for us to put the Olympic spirit in the right direction and expand Heathrow, securing our commercial future and creating a legacy of skills and employment that Britain can be proud of.
Lord Paul Dayton  Chairman of the Heathrow Council and former Trade Attache to the Treasury
Adblock Plus, Facebook are playing cat and mouse on ad blocking
For companies that make money from online advertising, trying to bypass ad-blocking software is a "cat-and-mouse" game, according to one of the companies that creates the software.
On Thursday, just a couple of days after Facebook announced that it was going to block ad blockers on its desktop version of the site, Adblock Plus posted a blog post saying that users can update their filters in the app to block ads on the social network again.
Facebook announced on Tuesday that the desktop version of the site will change the strings around its ads to make it harder for ad blockers to recognize which parts of the page are ads.
But Adblock now claims to have bypassed the new code.
In a blog post, Adblock spokesperson Ben Williams wrote that "this kind of back-and-forth struggle between the community of open source ad blockers and those who try to circumvent it has been going on since the invention of ad blocking", and it's possible that Facebook will introduce its own solution soon.
The fact that the world's largest social network is fighting back is a clear indication of how big a problem ad blockers have become for the industry.
Around the world, about 200 million people use ad-blockers, according to a study last year by Pagefair and Adobe; nearly four times the number who used such software in 2013.
With 1.3 billion daily active users who log on to Facebook from mobile devices, mobile advertising now accounts for 84 percent of Facebook's ad revenue.
However, the company is hunting for ad blockers on the desktop version, as mobile ad blockers are ineffective on Facebook's mobile social network apps and Instagram, according to the spokesperson.
But still, desktop advertising is a lucrative enough item that Facebook would consider it a worthwhile investment.
Also on Thursday, Facebook announced that it was updating its "advertising preferences" tool to give people more control over how ads are targeted to them.
On Thursday, Facebook said that the new Adblock filters are cause for concern as they will also block some non-advertising content on the site.
"This will not be a positive experience for people, and we plan to address this issue", a Facebook spokesperson said in an official email.
Ad blockers are a crude tool, so we focused instead on building tools like Ad Preferences to put the control in people's hands.
A woman was hit by a Swiss motorway in an apparent suicide.
Victim was found lying on the highway in the middle of the night.
Police are calling witnesses after a woman was run over by several vehicles on a highway early Thursday morning in an apparent suicide attempt.
The incident occurred on the A1 near the Morgue in the canton of Vaud just after midnight on Thursday.
The woman lay on the road in the dark "in a gesture of desperation" and was struck by several vehicles, police said in a statement.
In an apparent suicide attempt, the victim, a 49-year-old Swiss woman, was struck by several vehicles, including a truck.
She died instantly.
Several of the drivers involved have been questioned, but the identities of some are still unknown, police said, calling them and anyone else who witnessed the accident to come forward.
A criminal case was initiated, a "logical" step in such a situation, lawyer Gilles Hofstetter told Le Tribune de Geneve.
However, it remains to be seen whether any of the drivers involved will be charged.
Was it possible to avoid the impact?
That's for the prosecutor to determine",  stated Hofstetter.
Two other similar cases in the last five years suggest that the drivers will not be held accountable.
In each case  both of which involve a person walking in the dark on a freeway  it was ruled that motorists cannot expect to meet a pedestrian on a freeway in the middle of the night, the newspaper reported.
Last year, the officer was acquitted of manslaughter after she struck and killed a man lying on the A1 near Payerne on the night of August 2014.
22-year-old victim drank and passed out on the road, court heard.
The court found that the female police officer who responded to the emergency call was driving the vehicle in a manner that was justified, and that the presence of a person on the road was "a completely exceptional and unpredictable situation", the judge said.
Anyone with information about the incident Thursday near Morge should call the police on 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44.
NASA climate model: Venus was once inhabited
Venus may once have been inhabited, according to new NASA climate model estimates.
Scientists at NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies have developed a model for studying the past of Venus, using tools and algorithms similar to those used by climate scientists.
The model was designed to determine whether Venus, with its hot, waterless surface and atmosphere saturated with carbon dioxide, could ever have had conditions like Earth's.
Scientists had previously assumed that Venus's low rotational speed was due to its dense atmosphere.
But the latest modeling suggests that Venus could have had a thin atmosphere, like Earth, and still be rotating slowly.
The model also considered the topography of early Venus.
The planet probably had more dry regions than Earth, but it once had enough water and enough geographic variability to create conditions for life and prevent rapid evaporation.
Early Venus also benefited from the sun, which was 30 percent dimmer.
"According to the GISS model, Venus's slow rotation is putting its day side behind the sun by almost two months at a time", explained GISS scientist Anthony Del Henio in a press release.
This warms the planet's surface and produces rain, which creates a thick layer of clouds that acts as an umbrella, protecting the planet's surface from much of the solar heat.
The result is average climate temperatures that, surprisingly, are a few degrees cooler than they are on Earth today.
The model shows a history of Venus that is similar to the evolution that planetary scientists had previously assumed.
Although Venus may have once been habitable, it has been subjected to too much heat and ultraviolet radiation for several billion years.
Its oceans evaporated and its water vapor was scorched by ultraviolet radiation.
When its hydrogen was gone, it was just a dense atmosphere of carbon dioxide with a deadly greenhouse effect -- that's Venus as we know it today.
The researchers shared the results of their new climate model of Venus in the journal Geophysical Research Letters.
Patrick Roy is leaving the Avalanche as their head coach.
Patrick Roy stepped down as coach and vice president of hockey operations for the Colorado Avalanche on Thursday, citing a lack of influence during the team's decision-making process.
Colorado's executive vice president/general manager Joe Sakic confirmed the news and noted that the club will begin looking for a new coach immediately.
"Over the past three years, I have carried out my duties as head coach and vice president of hockey operations for the Colorado Avalanche with energy, passion and determination", the 50-year-old Roy said in a statement.
I spent the summer thinking long and hard about how I could improve this team, give it the depth it needed and take it to a higher level.
To achieve this goal, the vision of the coach and vice president of hockey operations must be ideally aligned with the vision of the organization.
He should also have a say in decisions that affect the team's work.
These conditions are not met at this time.
Saqik, who hired Roy on May 23, 2013, thanked Roy for his contribution to the team.
"Patrick informed me of his decision today", said Sack.
We appreciate all that he has done for our organization, and we wish him every success in the future.
Roy was named the Jack Adams Award winner as the league's top coach during his first season with the Avalanche in 2013-2014.
He led the club to 112 points and a Central Division victory, but Colorado was swept by Minnesota in the first round of the playoffs and has lost the playoffs the past two years.
The Avalanche posted a 39-39-4 record in the 2015-2016 season and were five points behind the Wild in their bid for a second straight berth in the Western Conference.
A Hall of Fame goalie, Roy won four Stanley Cups - two each with the Montreal Canadiens and the Avalanche.
North Sea oil workers resume negotiations and suspend strike
Workers' strikes over North Sea oil workers' salaries have been suspended and all sides of the debate are starting a new round of negotiations, leading representatives of the parties have said.
Strikes against the oil services company Wood Group were sporadically organized on platforms in the North Sea, which are under the control of Royal Dutch Shell.
"The Wood Group and the Unite and RMT unions can confirm that we have agreed to resume the negotiation process to resolve the ongoing disputes", a joint statement said.
We're going to have a series of full-time meetings over the next few weeks, starting early next week, to look at the problems in a fresh way.
The unions said their recent action, which they said was the first in more than 25 years, was aimed at potential pay cuts of up to 30 percent.
Wood Group has cut rates paid to contract workers in the North Sea by about 9 percent this year due to negative market tensions.
The reduction in rates by the company followed a 10% reduction in rates for contract employees working on shore in 2014.
The company says the additional cuts will give it the space it needs to weather the market downturn.
Shell, for its part, has laid off thousands of people and announced plans to end its oil and gas operations in up to 10 countries as it streamlines its operations following its mega-merger with British energy company BG Group.
Energy companies are under pressure from lower crude oil prices: the economic situation has worsened since the UK's decision to leave the European Union in June.
Scottish Member of Parliament Dave Anderson met with union leaders earlier this week to discuss one of the biggest labour conflicts to emerge in the North Sea in our era.
The North Sea, he said, is vital to the regional economy.
"In the North Sea, and indeed across the country, we need an economy that works for the many, not just the few", he said in a statement.
Less than $1.4 billion of spending on new projects in the North Sea is expected in 2016, in contrast to an average of about $7 billion over the past five years.
Kepler is measuring the rotation rate of the stars in the Pleiades cluster
The latest mission of the Kepler space telescope has helped astronomers compile the most complete catalogue of the rotation rates of stars in the Pleiades cluster.
The new data help astronomers understand why stars in a cluster rotate at different speeds, and how the rotation periods correlate with planet formation.
"We hope that by comparing our results with other star clusters, we will learn more about the relationship between the mass of a star, its age and even the history of its solar system", Louise Riball, a research associate at the Center for Infrared Processing and Analysis at Caltech, said in a press release.
The Pleiades Cluster is 445 light-years from Earth.
Many of the stars in the cluster are just now reaching maturity; they were born about 125 million years ago.
They're spinning faster than they ever will again.
At their peak rotational speeds, these adult stars spew out large amounts of stellar wind.
As they travel through the magnetic fields of the stars, these winds act as a brake on the stars.
As a star ages, its rotation rate begins to slow.
Kepler measures the rotation rate of each star by tracking the time between the appearance of recognizable stellar spots  such as sunspots.
The latest catalog of rotation speeds suggests that more massive stars rotate more slowly than less massive stars.
Rival compares stars to dancers: the larger ones perform pirouettes more slowly than the smaller ones.
"In the Pleiades 'ballet' we observe that those that rotate slowly are usually more massive, whereas those that rotate faster are usually very light stars", Riball said.
Because the Pleiades are so close, they serve as the perfect cosmic laboratory for matching the properties of stars to their rotation rates.
"The Pleiades star cluster provides a starting point for theoretical models of the rotation of stars, both young and old",  said Riball.
We still have a lot to learn about how, where and why stars slow down their rotation and hang their "dancing shoes" on their nails, so to speak.
Riball and her colleagues have detailed their latest analysis of the Pleiades' rotational velocities in three new papers that will soon be published in the Astronomical Journal.
Two agencies are investigating the activities of a group of Ukrainian saboteurs detained in Crimea, writes "Kommersant".
The FSB is gathering evidence of the detainees' involvement in the preparation of sabotage in Crimea.
Earlier, it was reported that a resident of the Ukrainian city of Energodar, Yevgeny Panov, who agreed to cooperate with the investigation, gave a confessional statement.
According to him, as objects for sabotage he considered the "Titan" chemical plant in Armenian, the oil base in Feodosia, the Kerch ferry crossing, the gas pipeline, as well as one of the military airfields.
Law enforcement believes that they have not been able to arrest all the accomplices of the saboteurs.
This, in particular, was the basis for the arrest of the suspects in the Kiev district court of Simferopol, the publication notes.
Stanislav Cherchesov has been appointed as head coach of the Russian national football team
At the meeting of the executive committee of the Russian Football Union, a decision was made to appoint Stanislav Cherchesov as the head coach of the Russian national football team.
The contract with him will be designed for two years - until the end of the 2018 World Cup.
On August 11, the RFU Executive Committee appointed Stanislav Cherchesov as head coach of the Russian national football team.
This is a famous footballer, who previously played in the Moscow "Spartak" on the position of a goalkeeper, as well as a coach with solid experience, who was a mentor of such Russian teams as the same "Spartak", "Jemchuzina-Sochi", "Terek", "Amkar", "Dynamo", as well as Warsaw's "Legiya", which became the winner of the national championship and the country's cup.
It is reported that the contract with Cherchesov will be signed in the near future and is designed for two years.
Thus, it falls to him to prepare the national team for the 2018 World Cup.
It is known that his coaching staff will include Miroslav Romashchenko, Gintaras Stauche, Vladimir Panikov.
There is information that the salary of the entire coaching staff will be 2.6 billion euros per year.
According to media reports, the Russian Football Federation's leadership has set Stanislav Cherchesov the goal of taking the Russian national team to the semifinals and winning medals.
As the coach himself stated, he considers creating a competitive environment in the team as a priority and is going to give the players the opportunity to express themselves.
Cherechov also said he was glad he was chosen.
The first match under the leadership of Cherchesov, the Russian national team will hold on August 31 in Antalya - it will be a friendly meeting with the Turkish team.
Earlier, the post of head coach of the Russian national football team was held by Leonid Slutsky, who combined it with coaching at the club CSKA.
He announced his resignation after the Russian national team's failed performance at Euro 2016 in France.
He took responsibility for the team's poor result.
Squeezed between Angola and South Africa, Namibia suffered greatly during its long struggle against apartheid.
Nevertheless, after gaining independence from South Africa in 1990, this country of 2.4 million people has made tremendous progress, especially in the past few years.
The main reason for Namibia's success is that the government places a lot of emphasis on education.
While people in developed countries take free primary and secondary education for granted, in many poor countries, secondary and even primary schools charge tuition.
Moreover, governments are often advised to introduce tuition fees to "recover costs".
However, in Namibia, primary education is free.
Moreover, since 2015, secondary education has also become free.
The country's authorities are also actively working on other important areas.
Efforts to eradicate malaria have reduced the annual number of cases by 97% over the last decade.
Contrary to the international trend of rising inequality, in Namibia it is decreasing.
Compared with 1993, the Gini coefficient, a standard measure of income inequality, fell by 15 points.
Then, 23 years ago, it was one of the highest in the world.
And the poverty rate has fallen from 69% in 1993 to less than 30%.
The number of people living in extreme poverty (less than $1.90 a day) also declined, from almost 53 percent to less than 23 percent.
Namibia also has the highest freedom of expression rating in Africa, according to Reporters Without Borders.
The country has significantly outpaced the United States and other rich nations.
It also has a favorable rating - one of the highest in Africa - in the "Corruption Perceptions Index" compiled by human rights campaigners from Transparency International.
Even now, when commodity prices are falling, Namibia is managing to maintain a high growth rate.
At the same time, the debt-to-GDP ratio is about 25 percent, which is less than one-third of the debt in the U.S. and most European countries.
Of course, Namibia has some problems.
The unemployment rate, at least by traditional methods of estimation, remains quite high, at almost 28 percent.
And like other countries in the region, Namibia has a high rate of HIV/AIDS infection - nearly 17 percent of the population is infected.
The World Bank estimates Namibia as an upper-middle income country, but the authorities insist that their country is actually a developing country.
Namibia certainly faces some of the difficulties that are common to underdeveloped economies.
The state has to develop a very large and arid country with a small population.
The country's desert lands are inhabited by isolated nomadic tribes of hunter-gatherers who must somehow be integrated into modern society without losing their identity.
Integrating people who were on the periphery of the world economy a quarter of a century ago is not an easy task for any country.
For Namibia, it is even more difficult: like any other country in the world, it is facing the effects of climate change.
But Namibia is not going to let up, the country is solving the problems it faces.
Almost immediately after independence, the authorities set about creating a diversified economy and a cohesive society.
Remarkably, rival political factions have come together to work for the common good.
Indeed, Namibia provides affordable health care not only to its own citizens but also to its neighbours.
About 15-20% of the visitors to health facilities in the northern districts of Namibia are Angolan citizens.
No one in Namibia is talking about building a wall to separate the country from its poor and corrupt neighbors.
Namibia's neighbours have realized that they have no choice, and so instead of fighting, they have decided to cooperate - sharing scarce water resources, participating in regional health projects, encouraging investment and student exchange.
Furthermore, the Namibian government has rightly reasoned that its abundant natural resources can easily become a curse, enriching a few at the expense of many.
The government understands that the revenue from Namibia's natural resources needs to be invested in infrastructure and manufacturing capacity.
They also realize that it would be irresponsible not to seek to make maximum profit from the sale of the country's resources, and are reviewing investment laws and mining contracts to make sure that this is the case.
Transparency is crucial to this process, which is why strong government support for freedom of speech is so important.
As President Haag Geingob has pointed out, the media often say things he does not like.
But after the struggle to free South Africa from apartheid, Namibia must defend its freedoms, the president says.
Not all of Namibia's key resources are exhaustible.
Some, such as fishing, are renewable, and the government is doing its best to preserve and strengthen them.
More than a million foreign tourists visit the country each year.
Nabiy shows that even those countries that start with serious shortcomings -- racism, colonialism, inequality, and low development -- can get on the path to shared prosperity.
Her achievement deserves international recognition and emulation.
Many have heard of the "Gold of Varna", the oldest gold objects ever created by man (4600-4200 BC).
Perhaps the most sensational archaeological discovery of the 1970s was the discovery of a fantastic quantity of gold artifacts in Bulgaria, the Varna necropolis, over 3,000 of them, weighing a total of 6 kilograms.
From one burial site alone, known as "Tomb No. 43", 990 gold items were recovered, weighing over 1.5 kg.
However, the official status of the world's oldest gold may soon be changed to a bead-like bead found by archaeologists in July of this year.
And again in Bulgaria, in a prehistoric settlement known as Tell the Unci.
Unlike Varna, a port city, Tell Yunacite is located far from the sea, near the village of Yunacite in the Pazardzhik district.
The bow is a gold band wrapped in a ring.
Yavor Boyadjiev, the head of the excavation at Tell Yunatsi, dated the find to 4600 BC and stated that it was at least 200 years older than the Varna gold.
The Varna Treasure, we remind you, dates from about the same period, 4600 - 4200 BC.
The technologies that allow perfectly accurate dating of metal do not currently exist.
How can we be sure which gold is older?
Professor Boyadjiev obviously knows more than he told Reuters: "I am absolutely sure that the gold of Yunatsite is older than the gold of Varna".
It is a find of extraordinary importance: it is a small object, but it is large enough to occupy a proper place in history.
In an interview with Reuters, Boyadjiev said that in the near future, scientists will analyze the composition of the metal, as well as re-examine and more thoroughly study the archaeological layer where the gold artifact was found.
This will help us date the bead as accurately as possible.
The location of the find also explains a lot.
Tell the Young is a famous settlement, even if you've never heard of it.
Today, Tell Unaseth is considered the oldest "town" in Europe.
Tell was founded by descendants of people who migrated to Europe from Anatolia (modern Turkey) in the 7th millennium BC.
Over the next centuries, the region saw a rapid development of metalworking, from the first metalworking skills to the creation of a full-fledged industry.
In the native historiography for this archaeological community there is a special name: Balkan-Carpathian metallurgical province.
In the 5th millennium BC, urban settlements began to emerge around the metalworking centers.
They are now called the oldest cities in Europe.
Of these, Tell Unate may be the oldest, as artifacts dating back to 4900 BC were found here.
I would call Tell Younacite the prototype of a modern city, although it's a very ancient settlement, even compared to Mesopotamia.
"This place is a thousand years older than Sumer", says Boyadjiev, referring to the commonly held view that urban culture originated in southern Mesopotamia, modern-day Iraq.
It was there that the first cities in the usual sense of the word arose.
Excavations at Tell Yunatsite have been ongoing since 1976.
During this time, archaeologists have excavated nearly 40 acres [12 ha], about a third of the estimated total area of the settlement.
Remains of a fortress wall, once three meters high, have been found.
Little remains of the houses and workshops, but archaeologists clearly distinguish between streets, public buildings, urban density, "business center" and residential suburbs.
Tell Unatze is often called the "Bird City": dozens of clay bird figurines have been found here.
All the birds are depicted in a state of rest, hence the assumption that they were not decorative objects, but the object of local cult.
The "bird city" was destroyed around 4100 B.C.E. - perhaps by Indo-European tribes from the northeast.
The nomads had no cities, but they had horses and guns.
The ten-foot walls of the fortress did not stop them.
Archaeologists found clear signs of the brutal slaughter: inside the houses were found the remains of old men, women and children with traces of wounds inflicted by battle axes.
New discoveries and new facts are appearing every year, changing the conventional view of ancient human history.
Bulgarian archaeologists are increasingly speaking not of individual cultures but of the "lost" first civilization of Europe, which originated in the Balkans.
A powerful stimulus to the search for this civilization was the "gold of Varna", found relatively recently, in 1972.
Logically, the golden luxury of Varna must have been preceded by something like the tiny gold bead created in Tell Yunatsit.
Porsche has artificially aged the 911 Targa .
It's been officially announced that the 911 Targa 4S Exclusive Design is being hand-crafted by the unit's specialists who work with production cars.
The "retro look" is, for example, in a special color Etna Blue, which was developed in 1960 for the Porsche 356B model - even the logo of the model is painted in this color.
In addition, the tender received a signature white graphics along the boards and special 20-inch wheel discs RS Spyder, as well as some details of the design of the body, painted in "white-gold metallic".
The interior of the retro-chart is noticeably smaller: it is distinguished, by a large number, by gray-blue gamma design, new chairs with expanded ranges of electrical adjustments and trimmed black anodized steel thresholds with the logo of the division.
In addition, when buying a special version, each customer will receive a car cover and a richly decorated album with photos of the production process.
The specialists of the Porsche Exclusive did not touch the power plant: the retro-trailer by characteristics is quite the same as the serial one.
It is equipped with a six-cylinder engine with a turbocharger capacity of 3.0 liters, developing 420 hp and 500 Nm.
The most dynamic version of the 911 Targa 4S is capable of accelerating to 100 km/h in 4 seconds.
The 911 Targa 4S Exclusive Design will be produced in limited numbers, but neither its volume nor the cost of each specific sports car are reported.
Facebook and ad blockers have started an arms race
Facebook's recent introduction of technology to prevent ads from being hidden on social media pages has prompted developers to implement ad blocking solutions for response actions.
AdBlock Plus has released an "antidote", but Facebook plans to soon make it useless as well.
So AdBlock Plus has announced its new technology, which is unlikely to be effective for long.
The social network noted that in an effort to fool the new "unblockable" advertising technology, AdBlock Plus's solution, along with commercial ads, also blocks many normal posts from friends or pages.
Facebook expressed regret over the AdBlock Plus policy and promised to fix the problem soon.
A source in the social networking community told TechCrunch that the code that renders AdBlock Plus useless on Facebook's desktop site will be ready in the next few hours.
Thus, social media and blockers have launched a kind of "arms race" to outdo each other, with users being the victims, who missed interesting posts from friends or saw ads where they were not used to seeing them.
The ethical aspects of ad blocking have been hotly debated recently.
Murmansk will bring the rapist to justice.
His case has already been investigated by the Investigative Committee of the Russian Federation for the Murmansk region.
The charge against the 54-year-old man is a very serious one of violent sexual acts.
The investigation has established that in late November 2015 the accused in the area of Pavlov Street in Murmansk committed sexual acts with the use of violence against a 20-year-old girl. The criminal case with the approved indictment is sent for consideration on the merits.
The sanction of the said article provides for a maximum penalty of imprisonment for up to six years.
Dongfeng to bring to Russia crossvan Fengguang 370 and pickup Rich New - the site behind the wheel www.zr.ru
The Dongfeng Fengguang 370 is a car that combines the advantages of a minivan and a crossover.
Another claimed Russian premiere is the Rich New pickup.
Many Western firms have decided to ignore the Moscow International Auto Show this year, so the vacancy of the Crocus Expo exhibition halls will be filled by Chinese firms.
In particular, a powerful front will be the Dongfeng Motor Corporation, which has a great view of the Russian market and intends to offer our motorists a number of interesting innovations in the near future.
One of them will be the cross-sweden Dongfeng Fengguang 370, which went on sale in China this spring at a price of 55 900 yuan (just under 550 thousand rubles at the current rate).
The Russians are not interested in such a price, and the question of supply to our country is still under discussion.
In China, by the way, Fengguang 370 by the results of June sales managed to reach the 11th place in the list of the best-selling minivans, although due to the large road clearance (175 mm) and protective plastic lining along the lower perimeter of the body it can be attributed to crossovers.
The crossover is built on the front-wheel-drive platform of the younger model Fengguang 360, the 370 has the same wheelbase of 2725 mm, but the body is slightly longer (4565 mm against 4510 mm), the design is more solid, and the equipment is richer.
The interior is decorated with wooden panels, but the large vertical touch screen "like Tesla's" on the center console shown in the photo was only on early exhibition copies of the crossvan, and cars with "music" were sold more simply.
Five of the seven seats can be easily folded, forming a flat loading area of 1650 mm long, the maximum capacity of the luggage compartment is 1500 litres.
The engine for the Fengguang 370 is only one - a 1.5-liter gasoline "atmospheric" with a capacity of 115 hp, coupled with a 5-speed manual gearbox.
The manufacturer is modestly silent about the dynamic qualities of the machine, but promises a frugal budget of the owner's appetite at the level of 6.7 l/100 km.
The Rich New pickup is a familiar to Russians Nissan NP300 Navara of the past generation, but with a slightly refined Chinese stylists design.
Despite the outdated design, this model is still in stable demand among Chinese consumers as a reliable and unpretentious "working horse".
At a similar price, the Rich New is likely to interest the Russians, because modern Japanese pickups have become prohibitively expensive.
Rich New is equipped with two engines to choose from: a 2.4 L (137 hp) petrol engine or a 2.5 L (116 hp) turbo diesel.
The transmission is mechanical only, the drive is on the rear wheels, but there are modifications with a hard-wired "front".
The new flagship A9 sedan will also be on the stand of Dongfeng, its Russian premiere was announced by the representative of the Chinese firm back in June.
Minivan-like crossovers are becoming more and more popular in the Chinese market, with the latest being the Cowin V3 and the SWM X7.
Currently, the Russian Dongfeng lineup consists of two models: the S30 sedan and the H30 Cross hatchback.
In seven months this year, the dealers of the Chinese company sold 696 cars in our country.
Transportation tax notices will no longer be sent by mail - the site is www.zr.ru
The tax office has changed the way they send out property tax notices.
All Russian car owners are used to the same scheme: in summer and autumn, they receive by mail a receipt for the payment of the transport tax for the previous year.
But this year, many will not.
The fact is that the tax authorities have quietly changed the procedure for notifying citizens.
Those who are registered in the "Personal Account of the Taxpayer" on the official website of the Office nalog.ru, will receive notifications in electronic form.
The inspection automatically considered such Russians to be online users and deleted them from the standard, "paper" mailing list.
The news will affect all vehicle and property owners.
Everyone else will continue to receive the same letters.
However, there is an opportunity for account holders to return to the old scheme.
To do this, they have to visit the tax office and write a statement during August.
On the one hand, the new order is more modern and convenient.
The notification will appear in the "personal office" immediately after it is written, whereas the letter will go for several days and may be lost altogether.
In addition, the number of users of the Internet service of the tax inspectorate has exceeded 18 million people, which will allow the department to save seriously on mail.
On the other hand, a modest update on the inspection website is clearly not enough to inform citizens about the changed order.
Some may have registered at a "personal account" for a one-time service and long ago forgotten about it.
These people will not wait for the mail and will unwittingly fall into the category of nonpayers with all the consequences that follow.
Access to the "Personal Account" is possible in three ways: through the gosuslugi.ru account, using an electronic signature or entering the login and password specified in the registration card.
You can get it in person at any tax office (regardless of where you are registered).
We remind you that this year, the transport tax must be paid by December 1st.
The notification started in July.
The tuned Mercedes-Benz G-Class, where the refinements are aimed at achieving very high performance, is a thing in itself.
But the controversial concept did not embarrass the masters of the G-Power company, who took on the modification of the sports version of the Mercedes-AMG G 63.
G-Power is known for its love of BMW cars, but nothing human is foreign to its master.
Indeed, why not improve the G 63 - 571 - power flying ax with tank aerodynamics and acceleration to 100 in 5.4 seconds?
By pumping the muscles of a crazy helix, the engineers took advantage of the benefits of a 5.5-liter supercharged eight.
But the acceleration to the hundredth has improved by a measly 0.1 seconds, and now the flying brick is able to take a leap of 5.3 seconds.
But accelerations from medium speeds certainly give it a marked advantage.
The speed limit is scary: if the standard G 63 does not go faster than 210 km / h, then the tuning all-terrain with deactivated electronic "collar" is able to squeeze out 250 km / h.
Externally, the car is virtually indistinguishable from its factory original, with the exception of the other wheels - the 23-inch Hurricane RR 305/35 ZR 23.
The luxury division of Mercedes-Maybach has announced a striking 6-meter concept coupe that will be showcased at the Pebble Beach Concours d'Elegance.
Mercedes-Benz is set to compete with the "green sub-brand" BMW i and will promote its electric models under a separate brand.
At least four new eco-innovations are expected in the coming years.
