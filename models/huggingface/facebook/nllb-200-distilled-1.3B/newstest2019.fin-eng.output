Emeli Kouki led the Hurricanes to a home victory in the opening game , the second victory for Savo Volley .
Hurricane-Loimaa, who won seven consecutive men's volleyball Champions League medals, started the 2018-19 season with a home win when Raision Loimaa were defeated 3-0 on Saturday.
Eemeli Kouki, who returned from Romania to Finland, was the most effective Hurricane with 22 points.
There were some arrangements for the foreign countries, but they didn't work out, and then I got a call from the League.
And it was pretty quick to get things sorted out, Hook said.
Like Hook, Loimus also played Tommie Drumpunen who supported Hook with 18 points.
The most effective of the guests was the national team striker Samuli Kaislasalo, who played with a match-by-match agreement with 17 points.
Winning the opening game is always important.
Many players had experience with their opponents, and that added to the game.
Our game is not finished yet, but the goal is of course to continue the medal round, Hook said.
I 'm gonna beat the Savoy Valley with the most power .
Miro Määttänen was the most effective at Savo Volley with 18 points when the team beat the Vieremällä Vantaan Ducks 3-0.
Our game was volatile, especially on the offensive end, but fortunately we got a tight win.
At least I didn't have any conscious different charge when I played against my former team, Määttänen said.
Antti Siltala, who started his career in the 2000-01 season in the Vierens Volleyball 3rd division, scored 12 points.
Head coach Jukka Tuovinen was pleased with many things.
The hall was small, so the atmosphere was on the roof all the time.
I'm sorry, I missed the opening.
Miro was king, Sillik played a good game, too, Tuovinen said.
Siltalan's last season in the league was 2006-07, when he won silver at the Pielaveden Sammo while Tuovinen was still the head coach.
Thiago Maciel was the Ducks' leading scorer with 14 points.
♪ The star of the Akaa-Volleys again ♪
The 2012-13 league points winner, Joni Mikkonen, has started this season strong.
The batter scored 25 points as Akaa-Volley took their season opener after beating the Kokkola Tigers 3-2.
The season's off to a good start.
Today, of course, we were close to losing, because we were down 17-21 in the fourth.
We were hoping for a draw, and Mikkonen said the fifth round came at the same time.
A few seasons ago, the Tigers' most productive player in the playoffs was batter Edvarts Buivids, who had 28 points.
The countryman, Aleksandrs Kudrjashovs, supported with 17 points.
We didn't get much of a grip on the guy's hack, Mikkonen said.
Finland is the world's number one in the comparison of human capital
Finland is the world leader in human capital, reports the scientific journal Lancet.
The study compared the development of human capital between 1990 and 2016.
Over the years, 195 countries were compared.
In both years Finland was number one in statistics.
In 2016, the top five were almost the same as in 1990.
Finland was previously followed by Iceland, Denmark, Canada and the Netherlands.
Later, the Netherlands was ranked one place higher, and Taiwan was added to the list instead of Canada.
In 2016, Niger and South Sudan were the worst performers.
The measurement of human capital looks at the education level, access to education, skills and health of the population.
The World Bank has identified the link between human capital and economic growth.
Real Madrid's Thibaut Courtois kept Atletico in check, and the home game ended goalless.
Real Madrid goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois struggled in a battle of glory, and the home game of the Madrid team ended in a goalless draw late Saturday in the Spanish football league.
Atletico Madrid's Antoine Griezmann and Diego Costa were closest to the goal, but Belgian goalkeeper Courtois was able to get a shot.
Courtois played three seasons for Atletico on loan while a Chelsea player.
Earlier this week, the International Football Association (FIFA) named him the goalkeeper of the year.
The best goal of the game at Real was scored by Gareth Bale, but his shot went over the line at the end of the first half.
Bale was traded after the break for a thigh injury.
According to ESPN, disappointed Real fans shouted the name of goalkeeper Cristiano Ronaldo, who has moved to Juventus.
Now Under Attack in the United States - A Powerful Document Reveals Why
The U.S. Senate is currently trying to decide whether to select Brett Kavanaugh, nominated by President Donald Trump, as one of the nine justices on the Supreme Court.
Many in the Republican Party hope that Kavanaugh's decisive vote will overturn the Roe v. Wade decision that legalized abortion in the United States in 1973.
The documentary film Reversing Roe - America and Abortion Rights, by Ricki Stern and Annie Sundberg, shows how this has developed over the years.
As incredible as it may seem, the topic is also relevant in Finland.
The Minister for Foreign Affairs Timo Soini (S), has been campaigning for safe abortion and has received varying degrees of support from the majority of our Members of Parliament.
The powerful documentary opens with a meeting with gynecologist Colleen McNicholas, who, because of the tightening of the laws, has become the only doctor practicing abortion in the state of Missouri.
The armed security guard at the clinic says he's standing up for religious freedom in the United States.
The news footage is reminiscent of the deadly terrorist attacks on clinics.
Let's go back to the time when abortion was illegal in the United States.
At that time, the Lutheran Churchmen's Association directed women to trusted abortion doctors.
The arguments of the pastor interviewed are good, but they are not really necessary, a photograph of a woman who died from an abortion she performed is enough.
There were 5,000 deaths in the United States in the last five years.
The Republican Party was the main advocate of legalizing abortion.
Back in 1967, in California, the abortion rights act was signed by Governor Ronald Reagan.
Later, during his 1980 presidential campaign, Reagan in particular began to reverse his policy of mixing religion with politics to win voters.
His abortion stance was echoed by his successor, George Bush Sr.
And so did Donald Trump.
The document goes to the heart of the matter in its search for a basis for politicizing abortion.
When religious organizations that supported segregation were denied tax exemptions, they became politically active.
The choice was abortion.
Religion has brought extraordinary knots into politics.
As I write this, the United States is in a situation where the president who has been bragging about sexual harassment but who has captured the voices of the religious right with his abortion cover has chosen Kavanaugh, who many women now accuse of sexual harassment, as the nominee for the Supreme Court.
Kavanaugh can have the power to decide the rights of 164 million American women and girls based on his balanced position.
The Israeli army shot dead seven Palestinians, including two children, during a mass protest at the border.
Nearly 200 Palestinians have been killed in the past six months as Israel has fired on protesters in the border area.
Israeli soldiers shot seven Palestinians on Friday in the Gaza border area, the Palestinian Health Ministry said.
The Palestinian Health Ministry said two children were among the dead, a 12-year-old and a 14-year-old.
The Ministry of Defense says 505 people have been injured.
89 of these were bullet wounds.
The Israeli army has confirmed that it opened fire and launched an airstrike on the border area as protesters threw rocks and explosives at Israeli forces.
The army says it has begun using force to prevent protesters from breaking through the fence or trying to cross it.
At least 191 Palestinians have died in Gaza protests since March, when Palestinians began weekly protests on the border.
The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights estimates that 12,000 people have been injured.
The protesters demanded access for Palestinian families to the areas from which Palestinians were forced to leave when the state of Israel was established in 1948.
A Palestinian sniper has killed one Israeli soldier.
Explosives dropped by Palestinian kites and helium balloons have set fire to forests and farmland in Israel.
Santa got the penalty kick . He didn 't get to shoot himself .
Wigan top scorer Chey Dunkley appeared to knock him out with a tackle from behind in the penalty area.
Referee Gavin Ward has allowed the game to continue.
His interpretation is that the tackle was clean.
Santa Claus couldn't believe his eyes.
I think the situation was left to the discretion of referee Ward, who gave Norwich a penalty kick in the 85th minute when Santa was knocked out.
Ward threw a penalty kick, and Mario Vrancic scored the game-winning goal.
Santa has scored five goals for Norwich in the Champions League.
The last one was born last Saturday against QPR with a stylish chest muscle.
Santa got his work back.
After losing the ball, he went on until the end.
He was a goal scorer. He was a defensive player.
Norwich's fifth game in two weeks.
The team continues in the League Cup.
It's a five-win pipeline.
The pedophile service was immediately booked - In Finland, some 40,000 people are interested in children
It is estimated that two percent of men and a small number of women experience at least some sexual interest in men of puberty.
In Finland, this represents about 40 000 persons.
Until now, those who are sexually interested in children or adolescents have had difficulty in getting help.
The SeriE project, a joint effort between the Crime Support Foundation and Sexpo, trains professionals to deal with pedophiles as clients and to help people who are sexually interested in children.
When the project was announced in the spring, the advice and therapy centre Sexpos started receiving a flood of emails and appointments were booked very quickly, Yle says.
However, they are promised to be released in the autumn.
Many feel shame about the sexual attraction to children.
Most who have felt pedophilic feelings have not lived out their fantasies and thus committed a crime.
However, preference is usually a permanent trait.
Most of them hope to get rid of the thoughts that distress and depress them.
They also make normal life difficult, says Yelle sex therapist Patricia Thesleff, a specialist on the project.
I think that work is valuable if one child is spared sexual violence, says Thesleff.
The leaders of the Koreas or the Congolese gynecologist?
The idea of US President Donald Trump winning the Nobel Peace Prize may suddenly sound strange, but the odds are Trump is one of the biggest favorites to win the prize.
The background is Trump's role in getting North Korea to commit to denuclearization, at least on a rhetorical level.
The two most likely winners of the Nobel Peace Prize are South Korean President Moon Jae-in and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, who have met three times this year and pledged to work towards a peace treaty between their countries.
The warming of relations between the Koreas is remarkable, for just last year relations were good.
Yet, rewarding Kim, who for years has threatened nuclear weapons and led his country with an iron fist, would no doubt also raise criticism.
The Nobel Prize winners will be announced on Monday, and on Friday the most prominent prize will be announced, the Peace Prize.
If the prize is not awarded to those who have contributed to diplomacy on the Korean peninsula, one of the top candidates is Congolese doctor Denis Mukwege.
A respected gynecologist has treated thousands of victims of gang rape in his hospital in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and has become a world-leading expert in his field.
Mukwege's work has drawn attention to sexual violence, a chronic byproduct of many conflicts.
The UN Refugee Agency, which won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1954 and 1981, has also been considered a strong candidate.
The Nobel Committee has announced that this year's prize has 331 nominees.
The names of the candidates will not be made public.
Trump himself wouldn't mind if he got the Nobel.
In May, a reporter asked him at the White House if he thought he deserved the Nobel Peace Prize.
"Everybody thinks that, but I would never say that myself", Trump said with a smile.
I want to finish this.
The prize I want is a victory for the world, the president continued, referring to the North Korea talks.
But there are some things that make Trump's Nobel Prize unlikely.
The Norwegian Nobel Committee, which decides the prize, has often recognized individuals and organizations that represent liberal democracy and a pluralistic world order - the very kind of international cooperation that Trump has been seen as opposing.
In the 21st century, the prize has been awarded to three American politicians, all of whom were Democrats: Jimmy Carter in 2002, Al Gore in 2007, and Barack Obama in 2009.
So, to award Trump the Nobel Prize would require a complete ideological reversal from the Nobel Committee.
Fire report in tunnel: drivers behaving like they 're drunk and driving in the wrong direction
The traffic chaos on Route 1 in the city of Lohja happened on September 8.
The tunnel area was closed due to the announcement in both directions.
When it was discovered that the fire was a systemic failure, the fire department tried to get traffic back to normal.
But it didn't work out that fast.
We tried to open the road once before, but the traffic center said that it can not be opened because there are drivers on the road and they drive as they please, the firefighter Pasi Kääriäinen told STT.
The highway was then set to go even in the wrong direction after only a moment's wait.
When the first one starts acting against the traffic rules, a few others often follow, surprises Tapio Heiskanen, Traffic Safety Liaison Officer.
Traffic regulations state that you must stop only for the most compelling reason on highways and tunnels.
The road safety authority reminds that in exceptional circumstances, you cannot risk the traffic by taking hasty action.
The warning vehicles shall at all times be allowed to pass as freely as possible.
In particular, reverse driving on the motorway is prohibited, as is making a U-turn and reversing.
The same prohibitions apply in tunnels, where the headlights must always be on.
It is also forbidden to stop without a compelling reason, as is parking.
In recent times, there have even been cases where a driver has stopped in a tunnel to brush the snow from his car.
It should be clear that this is the wrong place and time for the activity in question", Heiskanen says in a statement from the Transport Safety Board.
The Ilves fans would have loved to have continued to party even though the boat was stuck at the bottom of the lake.
The Ilves fans, who were being transported by the inland waterway ship M/S Tampere, would have liked to stay on board to continue their victory celebration, even though the ship was stuck at the bottom of the lake with its bow, says Juho Syrjä, the captain of the ship at the time of the incident.
The M/S Tampere, en route from Hämeenlinna to Tampere, was driven off course late Saturday evening and stuck to the bottom of Vanajavesi in Akaja.
The 19 passengers and five crew members on board were evacuated to the mainland overnight.
No one was hurt in the accident.
The Ilves fans would have liked to have continued to party on the ship until morning, but of course it made more sense to send them on a fire department ride to the port and on a bus home, Syrjä told STT.
The Ilves fans had been in Hämeenlinn to watch the match between Ilves and HPK, which ended in a 4-3 victory for Ilves.
According to the surveyor, the hail on Saturday was caused by the water level in Vanajavaten being about half a meter lower than normal.
The Commission also notes that the Norwegian authorities have not provided any information on the nature of the damage caused by the collision.
No more mention of a collision.
The accident occurred on the western side of the narrow Jumusensalmi shortly after the boat had crossed the motorway bridge between Tampere and Helsinki.
The incident was not dramatic, as the ship was travelling at a very slow speed and the impact on the bottom did not cause a more significant collision.
According to the report, the bottom trapping has not caused any leakage or pressure on the ship and the ship will continue its cruise as normal.
A diver came to inspect the ship Saturday morning before the boat was towed off the shore.
We will go to the shipyard to check that there is no damage, Syrjä says.
The Commission believes that the next cruise to Tampere, booked for next weekend, can be arranged.
He says the cruise season will continue until Independence Day.
No need for ambulances .
The emergency services received an alert Saturday night shortly after 12:30.
Ambulance services were called to the port of Viola to receive the evacuated passengers, but there was no need for them.
Late last night, fire chief Matti Willman said evacuation conditions at the lake were difficult because of darkness and fairly strong winds.
The Pirkanmaa rescue service announced after half past three on the night before Sunday that all on board had been evacuated and the passengers had been transferred by bus to Tampere.
The cruise ship was built in 1957 and has been renovated in 2001, 2014 and 2017.
Trump's nominee for justice, who's been accused of harassment and drinking, could be stripped of his top job.
Brett Kavanaugh, a nominee for U.S. Supreme Court justice, may well lose his bid for the position, says program director Mika Aaltola of the Foreign Policy Institute.
So far, at least three women have accused Kavanaugh of sexual harassment and misconduct during his time at the university.
According to Aalto, the suspicions have brought so much political pressure to the Republican Party that President Donald Trump may end up nominating someone else.
In the United States, from time to time, a presidential nominee for the Supreme Court has been a source of controversy.
In this case, the judge candidate has usually withdrawn himself, says Aaltola.
It's how the president has been able to keep his face.
The nomination would be a Democratic victory .
The U.S. Supreme Court tends to be above politics, but in the case of Kavanaugh at least, the selection of a new justice has become a politically sensitive process.
If Kavanaugh is appointed, Aalto says the decision will likely rain down on the Democratic Party in the upcoming midterm congressional elections.
It would increase voter turnout among young people and women who are more likely to vote for the Democrats.
On the other hand, a conservative Supreme Court nominee would be a long-term victory for the Republicans.
The opportunity for appointment does not come every presidential term, since in the United States, Supreme Court justices are appointed for life.
In practice, some of them have retired at their own request at about 70 or 80 years of age.
I'm sure some Republicans are questioning the nomination.
Aaltola notes that background checks are normally done on candidates for the U.S. Supreme Court.
Even though Trump has only given the FBI a week to investigate further, Aalto says it may still bring something relevant to light.
It might.
"There's hardly smoke without fire", says Aaltola.
Aalto says what is certain is that there will be a heated debate about whether Kavanaugh is fit or unfit for office before the Senate makes its decision.
Republicans have a 51-49 majority in the Senate, but at least two female Republican senators are expected to be skeptical of Kavanaugh's nomination.
The most embarrassing thing would be if the nomination was put to a vote and the Republicans lost.
A woman identified a suspect in Salisbury as a military intelligence agent.
A Russian woman has told the BBC that she identifies the Russian suspect in the Salisbury poisonings as a Russian military intelligence agent.
She said that the photographs showed that the man was Anatoly Chep, a member of the GRU.
The online community Bellingcat and the Russian community Insider Russia said earlier that they had uncovered one of the men suspected of poisoning, Chepigo.
Earlier, they said they had found evidence that the men's current identities were covert ones.
The BBC team traveled to the Far East to the village where Chepiga grew up, near the Russian-Chinese border.
A woman in the village identified a young man named Chepigan from a photo posted by Bellingcat.
He recognized the same man from photographs taken by British police of a man now calling himself Ruslan Boshirov.
The Russians are suspected of poisoning former double agent Sergei Skripal and his daughter with Novitshok nerve agent in March.
The Skripals survived.
He is responsible for the repressive actions of the 'Donetsk People's Republic' and 'Donetsk People's Republic'.
Russia continues to deny any connection to the suspect's GRU involvement.
The men suspected of poisoning said in an interview with Russian television earlier in September that they had been to Salisbury as tourists.
The elderly as a dumping ground for social reform
The Commission has now given a living example of what the social security reform defined by the Sipilä government means in practice.
The Oulu County Health Services Department is responsible for the health services of the county in which I was born.
The city council leaders are warning the council about the change limiter.
If the cost of health care goes up now, the city's state aid will be cut in the future.
The city's board of directors are scared, and most of them are ready for a major restructuring of the nursing home, ending the hospital's bed and breakfast unit and a small memory unit.
Home care would be increased, which means that in the long-distance Vaal, the elderly living in remote villages would be uprooted to be cared for "at home" near the health centre.
Attendo was counting on the city to pay him off.
The left of the election did not swallow the poor preparation, but organized a good public event, which was attended by many relatives, relatives and also representatives of other parties.
I presented in the Sothe County Training Workshop how the municipality of Vaala is already the largest provider of home care for the elderly in the whole of North East Germany.
Also present was Carina Läntinen, a local councillor.
The local newspaper made a big story about the occasion, and it in turn lifted the Oulu Arc's preparers to their feet.
The war makers do not write in any papers that Attendo has built a new nursing home in Vaala, which is now waiting empty for residents.
There are no other service providers.
The manufacturers only talk about the service voucher, but do not say what levels of care it will provide or what staff structure Attendo will have to care for the elderly up to the escort service.
Without a nurse?
The reason for the closure of the health centre is that there is no doctor on call.
Attendo will also have to rely on the doctors at Vaala Health Centre.
The example of the election shows how the central officials are manipulating the councillors with incomplete information and the councillors are being pushed against the wall with a change limiter.
The Centre Party is thus emptying the Vaal of its inhabitants, who will be left there unprotected to move out voluntarily if they have the opportunity.
Was it one of the central campaign statements that the whole country was to be kept inhabited?
Turkish President Erdogan opens the Grand Mosque in Cologne
In Cologne, Germany, thousands demonstrated as Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan opened one of Europe's largest mosques.
Several hundred people had gathered on the banks of the Rhine already in the morning.
Erdogan is not welcome, the protesters' signs read, and slogans condemned fascism.
The Turkish government has been forced to withdraw its aid to the Turkish authorities.
In Cologne, some 10,000 people were expected to take to the streets in advance to protest, among other things, the human rights situation in Turkey.
Erdogan's supporters had also gathered near the Grand Mosque.
However, the police had isolated a large area from the mosque for security reasons.
The European Union is committed to the fight against terrorism and to the fight against terrorism.
During his visit, Erdogan met with German Chancellor Angela Merkel twice.
Erdogan and Merkel vowed on Friday to rebuild relations between the two countries, which have deteriorated significantly since Turkey's 2016 coup attempt.
The Commission is also proposing to increase the number of EU-funded projects in the field of education and training.
The criticism surrounding the visit
Both Cologne Mayor Henriette Reker and North Rhine-Westphalia Premier Armin Laschet cancelled their attendance at the opening ceremony as criticism of Erdogan's visit intensified.
Cansu, a 30-year-old student from Turkey, said he had come from Switzerland to attend an anti-Erdogan protest.
I want to be a voice for those who can't go out on the streets in Turkey.
They've been arrested, killed, subjugated.
For Erdogan, anything that deviates from his own thinking is terrorism.
The last leg of Erdoğan's visit to Germany in North Rhine-Westphalia is marked by a large proportion of Turkish-speaking people.
Three accused of murdering a journalist in Slovakia
In Slovakia, three people have been charged with the murder of journalist Jan Kuciak.
The prosecutor said Friday that three people are being charged with the February murder of Kuciak and his fiancée, among other crimes.
Earlier this week, police arrested eight people in connection with a murder investigation, but five of them have been released.
Kuciak was found shot dead in February with his fiancée at their home in Bratislava.
He had been investigating political connections with the Italian mafia.
Police have suspected the murders are connected to Kuciak's investigation.
The case and Kuciak's article have raised concerns about media freedom and corruption in Slovakia.
There may be problems with the distribution of the cattle on Sunday in the sparsely populated areas
Because of a printing error, the Karjalainen will also have to be mailed without an address on Sunday.
This may be reflected in the distribution of the magazine in scattered areas where the distribution to the common boxes has to be done from the outskirts.
The same was true of the Saturday paper, and the problem may continue on Monday.
The post office is putting extra newspaper clippings into the province.
Other Finnish subscribers' magazines are only mailed separately on Monday with a sticker.
There's a significant delay in the distribution of these magazines.
Vesa is a Finnish astronaut.
Today, in his upcoming talk show, journalist Arto Nyberg will be interviewing Vesa Heilala, among others.
Vesa is in the studio talking about his upcoming space flight, which he booked with Virgin Galactic back in 2010.
The price was EUR 151 000 and a bank loan was required to pay it.
If the original plans had worked, Vesa would have been in space a long time ago.
But the departure date has been postponed year after year.
Now, after a failed test flight in 2014 that claimed lives, it seems that things are back to normal.
If all goes well, commercial flights will begin later this year or next year at the latest.
Vesa's flight number is 300, which means that his journey will be approximately one year after the first flight.
The flight lasts 2.5 hours and takes 5 minutes in zero gravity at an altitude of 100 kilometers, a Finnish astronaut tells about his future on his website.
In the same address, he also backs up the yearning for space.
When I was a kid, I read a comic book called Space Ranger and I saw Star Trek on TV.
I mean, you've seen Star Wars, and that's why you're so obsessed with...
Why not? I'm not.
Everyone has their own dreams.
Manchester City was a cruel host .
Manchester City continued their unbeaten run in the Premier League when they beat Brighton 2-0 at home on Saturday.
The reigning champions are guaranteed their sixth victory of the season by the two top scorers Raheem Sterling and Sergio Agüero.
Sterling was able to steer his fourth goal of the season from close range to an empty goal when Leroy Sané found him in the 30th minute on the back of the Brighton goal post.
Agüero raised his own goal to five when he saw off the Brighton defense with Sterling in the 65th minute.
The Argentine was able to put the 2-0 score on the penalty spot with ease.
With six wins and one draw, City lead the Premier League with 19 points.
However, Liverpool, who have lost one game, are only one point behind.
Liverpool will face Chelsea in their seventh round tie on Saturday night.
Youth associations elected new decision-makers in Joensuu
The Finnish Youth Association elected new decision-makers for its next three-year term 2019-2021 at its meeting that ended on Sunday.
The chairman was Anu Sivonen from the Upper House and the vice-chairman was Petra Mäkeläinen from Häme.
The Council was elected by 40 full members and 40 alternates, the Finnish Youth Association announced on Sunday.
A youth group meeting was held in Joensuu.
We want our cultural activities to be known for quality and safety.
The Youth Summit in the Netherlands makes three promises in its three-year action plan: We will keep our doors open to all, and we will provide equal opportunities for people of all backgrounds and places of residence, and we will support volunteering and people on their own growth paths, the Finnish Youth Association said in a press release.
Lewis Hamilton praised Kimi Raikkon and said Ferrari was "surprised to lose a very important driver".
In an interview with the Swiss magazine Blick, the British Mercedes driver was asked if he believed that the release of Kimi Räikkönen from Ferrari's services would help Hamilton in the rest of the season.
Hamilton leads Ferrari's second driver Sebastian Vettel by 40 points.
A little less than three weeks ago, Ferrari announced that Raikkonen would not be staying in the car next season, and at the same time Raikkonen announced that he was moving to Sauber.
Hamilton, of course, doesn't think the Wrench would throw in the towel.
I don't think Kimi's gonna change for the rest of the season.
He's an exceptional professional, a fantastic driver.
He remains one of my favourite drivers and I am convinced that Ferrari is losing a very important driver.
It doesn't make any sense to me.
Hamilton has previously said that the Wraith has been one of his role models.
I don't know if Kimi knows this, but when I was young and dreaming of Formula One, I played Formula One on PlayStation every day.
I was always Kimi, which is pretty crazy, Hamilton said in June.
The F1 season continues on Sunday with the Russian Formula One Championship.
From the pole position, starting at 2 p.m., the race will be led by Valtteri Bottas in a Mercedes.
The evening paper will be following the race moment by moment.
The football A-team SM Championship match turned into a complete farce: the opponent arrived with only 7 players .
The boys' soccer league will end on Saturday with the final game of the season.
Before the round started at 1 p.m., the starting points for the championship match were clear: FC Lahti Akademi has enough first place to score a point against Vasa IFK.
To turn things around in the final round, the second-placed team in the championship match, Ilves, must beat PK-35 and wish the Gulf States a victory.
However, the Lahtians' championship was practically secured before the opening stroke, as Vasa IFK had arrived in Lahti with only seven players.
If there had been one less Vasa, the fight would not have started.
FC Lahti Academy won the match 16-0.
At halftime, the Bays led 7-0.
One reason for the loss of players is that the team has played with the same players in the A-Youth SM-Series, or P20-Series, and the Men's Second C-Block.
Vasa IFK have been playing in the Second Division practically the whole season against relegation.
In the second round of the final on Saturday, Vasa IFK will have to win the JBK away game and at the same time hope that Tampere United will lose their own away game against KuFu in Siilinjärvi Toiva.
The car ended up on the roof in Enos. The rescue service says it was a case of luck.
The car went off the road and ended up on a rooftop in Enno on the Juttuvaaranti road around 9:00 on Sunday.
There were four people involved in the accident.
Two of them suffered minor injuries, according to the rescue service.
Luck was on the side of good, the press release says.
The rescue service said the road was wet from the rain.
Police patrol was on the scene.
Supo is waiting for new means of inquiry: equipment procurement and recruitment already done, no plans for foreign operations
According to Supo's chief Antti Pelttari, the intelligence law has been prepared by purchasing equipment and training personnel.
The introduction of the Intelligence Laws would permanently add some EUR 10 million to the soap budget.
The offices of the Helsinki Security Police (Supo) on Ratakatu are already preparing intensively for the entry into force of the intelligence laws.
Antti Pelttari, the head of the Supo intelligence unit, told Lännen Media that equipment has already been procured for future intelligence missions.
Serena Williams shocks with a video of herself singing topless in a campaign to raise awareness for breast cancer.
Tennis superstar Serena Williams is winking again.
Now she is campaigning to raise awareness of breast cancer by posting a video on her Instagram account of herself singing with only her hands in front of her breasts, reports AFP news agency.
"I Touch Myself" is a 1991 hit single by Australian band The Divinyls.
In this video, Williams is supporting the Australian Breast Cancer Society.
"I played the worldwide hit The Divinyls to remind women to check their [breasts] regularly", Williams wrote on Instagram.
And yes, this put me in a bit of a bit of a discomfort zone, but I wanted to do this because it's a topic that affects all women, regardless of skin color, all over the world.
Early detection is the key to everything. It saves many lives.
The other writer of The Divinyls is Chrissy Amphlett, who died of breast cancer five years ago at the age of 53.
The music video is part of the I Touch Myself project, which was made in honor of Chrissy Amphlett.
"She died of breast cancer, but she gave us a hit song to remind women to put their health first", says Williams.
The video has been viewed 1.5 million times.
It was published early Sunday morning.
In the video's comments, Williams is being praised for his courage.
Williams pulled out of the Beijing tennis tournament earlier this week.
The background is the highlight of the U.S. Open tennis tournament three weeks ago.
Williams fired at the match referee, claiming, among other things, that men are allowed to behave much more aggressively than female players.
Chinese restaurant on the mountain trail is not for climbers
The restaurant offers traditional Chinese delicacies as well as spectacular views.
An extraordinary restaurant has opened in Zhejiang Province, China.
It's literally on the edge of a cliff.
You can look down at the forest below if you want.
The rugged landscapes at high altitudes make restaurant guests gasp at the Longquan Mountains.
To get to the restaurant, you have to walk through the peach trees.
The restaurant opened to hikers on September 19, 2018.
You know, I've got YouTube comments asking where the restroom is.
A walk to the restaurant requires good physical condition, according to the locals.
The Gorgon's run ends today.
All good things must come to an end.
Today, the national rural drama, The Raven's Running, has been quite popular.
The third season has gone on like hot coals: last week, 722 000 Finns watched the episode on television.
The highlights themselves no longer have any practical significance, as there is no sequel to the Heikki Luoman and Jukka Mäkinen series.
In the final, Jaska and Mirku's relationship takes another leap forward, and Jaska's mother seems to be the first to guess what the future holds.
Anss and Miisa are also warm, romantic in the light of recent events, but then Skinny comes back into the picture.
Even the police are suspicious of the skinny guy.
Yet none of you could have foreseen the fate of Lean.
Anita, on the other hand, is about to hear incredible news.
The last will of the distant one is revealed, which brings the woman to tears.
In a week, on Sunday nights, we'll be back with the latest episode of Sorjeon.
The Crab Run is tonight on TV1 at 9:05.
Do you think it's worth going to work tomorrow with a little cold?
Here are the facts for and against .
The flu season is in full swing.
A lot of people are going to decide if they want to stay home or not.
However, the worker should consider whether to spread the disease to others, since even mild symptoms can be contagious.
Sometimes the flu symptoms come on suddenly, sometimes they creep in.
In the latter case, you may already be infecting others, even if your symptoms seem minor, says the journal Prevention.
So, what, we should stay home?
Prevention suggests that the flu is contagious even when the person does not have symptoms.
The virus is transmitted from the day before the onset of symptoms to five days to a week afterwards.
Children may be more likely to contract the disease.
As soon as you recognize the symptoms, you should not be at school or work.
You can return to work when your cough has subsided and your fever is gone, says medical professor Gregory Poland.
You should also avoid exercise.
Going back to the gym too soon will slow your recovery.
Also, remember to wash your hands, wipe your hands with a handkerchief, and throw the toilet paper in the trash.
- But painful to move?
If you have to leave home sick, consider wearing a mask.
The mask doesn't keep the viruses in check, but it keeps the wearer aware of the area of the head.
Then, Poland says, no fingers should be put in the nose or mouth.
Sneezing is also restricted to the mask.
How, then, can infections be prevented?
The best practice is still to wash your hands and avoid touching your face.
The latter, however, is hard to avoid.
For example, in the United States, the average person touches his eyes, nose, or mouth every 15 to 30 seconds, warns Poland.
The new Miss Finland repeats the miss tradition: "My husband is a hockey player"
A hockey player and a Miss America are often linked.
This was also the case with Alina Voronkova, 23.
The 2018 Miss Finland crown is awarded to Pertunmaa-born Alina Voronkova.
The beauty now lives in the Bay, where she moved when she was 15.
Alina's mother is a Finnish-Indian and her father is Russian.
Because her father was Russian, Voronkhova was bullied at school.
My parents moved to Finland 25 years ago, but I was bullied because I was Russian.
I had no friends at all in the country of origin, Alina says at the announcement ceremony of the semi-finalists of the Miss Finland contest.
After high school, Alina decided to start fresh and move to the Bay to attend high school.
Soon the bride made new friends and the day began to roll on as expected.
At 15, you think you're an adult, but in hindsight, I really wasn't.
Three years ago, Alina met her current partner, Jonas Hurri, who is a Pelican.
After his SM-liiga career, the hockey player has played abroad, such as Sweden and China.
In 2009, he was in the Finnish national team at the Under-18 World Cup.
In the early days of their relationship, the couple lived apart for almost a year, but later Alina was able to travel the world with her husband.
If I could get into the winning triad and have a career with it, I don't want to believe that it would affect our relationship in any way.
Even if we have to live apart, trust works well, and the good thing about a long-distance relationship is that it stays that way all the time", smiled Alina in May.

Almost everyone is concerned about the sustainability of the planet.
Yet there's hardly anything you want to give up.
Sustainable alternatives to sustained growth are being sought, but even the theory of moderation faces major problems.
In a few generations, steady economic growth has brought ordinary people, especially in the Northern Hemisphere, a standard of living that was once only dreamed of.
However, the long-term excess of the earth's carrying capacity and climate change are threatening to shake the foundations of this market economy.
Two men were stabbed in the night before Sunday at the Carrying Sitrator at 4:00 a.m.
A man born in 1986 was seriously injured in the stabbing and another, born in 1968, was slightly injured.
The oldest of the men has already been released from the hospital.
Police have arrested one person who is being investigated for possible involvement in the stabbing.
Police are also looking for another suspect in connection with the incident.
The events are being investigated as attempted murder and aggravated assault.
A big point for IFK Mariehamn - the Inter coach regretted the mistake
IFK Mariehamn's Simon Silverholt's equaliser against Inter brought the team a significant point in the men's football league on Saturday.
Silverholt finished the 1-1 draw in the 78th minute.
Silvelholt got through from the right flank and lifted the ball, fortunately, over goalkeeper Henrik Moisander.
In the away game, the Maarianhaminals extended the gap to two points for the Turku Ballseura, who are in the goalkeeper's place.
"It's a big goal and a valuable point", summed up Maarianhamina head coach Peter Lundberg.
Lundberg said that the team did not, however, engage in the kind of fight he expected.
We made a lot of mistakes in the opening half, but luckily the turkey goal got us in the game stronger.
Inter's head coach, John Allen, said the game was under control, but the goal had caused pain again.
One defensive mistake took the whole point, Allen was upset.
We were the best again!

Finland is ranked first in the 195-country comparison.
The study measured the health and education of the population.
Finland is the best country in the world when measured by human capital.
Finland was ranked first in a survey measuring the health and education and learning of its citizens.
The study measured the change in capital between 1990 and 2016.
The study was published in The Lancet.
The conclusion is that human capital has a significant impact on how the economy can grow in the future.
The most serious situation is in Africa.
The continental countries took the lowest seven places in the comparison.

The STT was the first to report it.
The newspaper showed its inferior skills, the game is not yet certain
Jori Lehtera's strong underpowered play came to light when his NHL team, the Philadelphia Flyers, played their final practice game before the season started.
Philadelphia beat Boston 4-1, and Lehter pitched two innings to give Michael Rafflin a home run.
In the last few days, Lehter has been in the public eye on suspicion of drug use.
MTV reported on Wednesday that Lehterä is one of 23 suspects in a drug ring that includes drug use and drug trafficking.
The newspaper has denied any wrongdoing.
The club and the player have discussed the matter, and the NHL is investigating the case.
After the game, Sam Carchidi of the Philadelphia Inquirer, who closely follows the Flyers, estimated that Lehter is in the six-forward group, five of whom will make the NHL team.
In practice, Carchid said Lehter was excellent.
In the second round, Lehterä fought the puck with less force, pulled the defender into the net and passed to Rafflin, who was waiting for the opening goal.
The second time, the two of them worked together to score a goal at the very end of the game.
The Flyers will open the NHL season on October 4th with a home game against Las Vegas.
In Boston, defenceman Urho Vaakanainen is awaiting a decision from the coaching staff on whether he will be accepted into the NHL.
I thought boot camp was good.
I did my best, and I can be proud of it.
Now the coaches are gonna decide if I get to play.
"I believe I'm ready for the NHL", Vaakaninen said in an interview posted on Boston's Twitter account.
The guy from Vaakaninen, who learned to play the puck in the river boys, played against Philadelphia in 19.31.
On Boston's goal, Tuukka Rask gave up four runs and struck out 20.
Fly-back, Wild Island Lake, scored a 1-0 lead for Detroit as they beat Toronto 5-1.
In Calgary, Ilves was the backup, and Juuso Välimäki scored a touchdown, but Edmonton defeated Calgary 4-3.
The Oilers have also had a couple of players, including Jesse Puljujärve and goalie Mikko Kosk.
Florida's Alexander Barkov played for over 20 minutes and scored a goal in a home game against Tampa Bay.
Tampa won, 3-2.
Columbus defenceman Markus Nutivaara scored a consolation goal in the bottom of the ninth as Chicago defeated Columbus 4-1.
With the loser's goal, the Giant of the Hornets rejected a 23/27 puck.

Respondents are also asked whether Finland should be in line with other Nordic, Baltic, Central European or Western Russia countries.
A recent photo shows the change: the world's strongest man lost 40 pounds.
In 2017, Eddie Hall, crowned the world's strongest man, undergoes a remarkable transformation.
British Eddie Hall chased the title of world's strongest man long and determined.
Hall could eat up to 10,000 calories of food a day and weighed at most 200 pounds, according to the Mirror.
The shirts were a size 5XL.
Before winning the title, Hall admitted to doing damage to his body.
The human body wasn't designed to be this big, Hall said.
The Briton was chasing the World's Strongest Man title at every cost and the family man promised to quit his career if he got the title.
Hall didn't want his kids growing up without a father.
Hall kept his promise and was never seen again in the World's Strongest Man 2018 contest held in April.
Recently, Hall posted a picture on Instagram of himself posing for his activist ring in a significantly thinner condition.
Hall writes his current weight at 590 pounds.
Hall wrote that he now exercises five times a week.
The program includes boxing, cycling, and swimming.
And Hall works out four times a week at the gym.
This year's World's Strongest Man was won by Iceland's Hafþór Júlíus Björnsson, also known for his role in the TV series Game of Thrones.
The previous Finnish winner of the race is Janne Virtanen, who was first in 2000.
The restaurant ship M/S Tampere was wrecked in Pyhäjärvi.
The inland waterway vessel M/S Tampere ran aground late Friday evening on Lake Akaya.
The emergency services received a distress call about a water transport accident Friday night just after 12:30.
The 30-metre vessel M/S Tampere has run aground and is firmly attached to its bow by a stone, said firefighter Matti Willman.
The ship was carrying 19 passengers and five crew members.
Rescue officials say no injuries were reported.
Passengers and nearly all crew members have been evacuated from the ship to the mainland.
Now they are being transferred by bus to Tamperetta, said the deputy chief Jari Nieminen to STT after one o'clock in the morning.
The port of Viiala was alerted to ambulances to receive the evacuated passengers.
The ship, which was bound for Tampere from Hämeenlinna, had for some reason strayed from its course on the narrow west side of Jumusensalme.
The police are trying to figure out what happened.
Firefighter Matti Willman said earlier in the evening that conditions on the lake are difficult due to darkness and fairly strong winds.
The rescue service says the fate of the ship is uncertain.
It looks like the ship's not leaking.
After the evacuation, divers will begin to check on the situation at the bottom.
Built in 1957, the M/S Tampere is currently a restaurant vessel with a maximum authorised passenger capacity of 180.
The vessel also has a meeting room for private use.
According to the website of the ship, the cruiser was refurbished in 2001, 2014 and 2017.

Ex-managers are demanding unpaid bonuses from Robert Helenius .
Boxer Robert Helenius' fight tonight with Erka Teper is overshadowed by cash.
Today, the evening news reported on the appeal filed by boxing manager Jaakko Helminen and assistant referee Jussi Kokkilan, which charges Helenius with over EUR 80 000 in unpaid management fees, including late fees.
The Commission therefore concludes that the contested decision is not imputable to the State.
We've tried to reconcile, but there's no other choice.
This has been a clear mandate and a lot of work has been done, says Kokkila to Ilta-Sanom.
Helenius' current manager Markus Sundman sent a reply to the Evening Standard, which tells the events from the boxer's point of view.
Helenius denies that he is obliged to pay the amount claimed.
The defendant claimed that Kokkila and Helminen had offered their services to Helenius in a financially difficult situation and had promised to be able to organise matches and sponsorship income for him.
It was verbally agreed that Helenius would be obliged to pay the fees only as a percentage of his matches.
Repeatedly assured that Helenius would not have to pay anything, only to receive the income they arranged.
This is also the normal and only practice in the management of professional athletes.
The Commission has not yet decided on the amount of the aid.
There was never a written agreement to cooperate.
The answer to the first question was that Helenius would have wanted to agree on the income distribution in writing from the beginning, but Kokkila and Sundman did not complete the draft until the end of 2014.
He found the proposal to be poor and cut off his cooperation with Kokkilan and Helmis.
Helenius never fought once in his dealings with the Cuckoo and the Pearl.
A year after the end of the cooperation, Helenius was paid a 'small but substantial' bill for the manager's work.
This year, the same claims have been made.
Helenius considers the post-election activities of Helmis and Kokkila to be poorly done, the reply states.
Helenius will face Erkan Teper, seventh in the IBF heavyweight championship, today in Stuttgart.
A man of great heart and a good journalist
The entertainer and music producer Ilkka "Ile" Vainio knew the late radio presenter and journalist Erkki Päll for decades.
The long-time radio host and journalist Erkki Pälli died at the age of 83 from incurable liver cancer.
The announcement of the death of the presenter was published on Sunday in the Helsinki Sanom.
The report says Päll died on September 3rd.
Pälli announced his serious illness on his Facebook page in March 2018.
The publication was also seen by Ile Vainio, who was saddened to learn of the fate of a familiar man.
He left Facebook earlier as a sort of farewell, Ile Vainio says.
Vainio considers Erkki Pälli a multi-talented expert who became a brilliant journalist.
He remembers Päll as a very nice person with quick wit and funny things.
I got to know Erk as a little boy when I first went to Finnlevy at the age of 12 and started working as a warehouse worker.
That's when Erk and I met.
He was then Finnlevy's informant and held various positions, Ile Vainio recalls.
When I got promoted to record producer, there were hundreds of occasions where Erkki Pälli was a regular editor at all the parties doing stories about artists.
He was always knowledgeable and I could see how much he had a fire for entertainment, music and people.
When Erkki interviewed someone, he got right into the skin of the people he was interviewing.
He was a man of heart and a good reporter.
He became known to many as the esteemed radio host of Yale, but he also wrote some brilliant newspaper articles.
Erkki interviewed me a few times.
He was good at talking, and the misery is praising him.
For decades, Pälli worked as a journalist and in the Fazer record company with Toivo Kärje.
He was a music producer for Vesa-Matti Loir records.
However, Pöll's greatest passion was radio work, in which he had a distinctive style.
He began his radio career in the 1960's and became known to many listeners on the Yale air.
He retired in 1998.
The Finnish Ski Federation announced on Saturday that the association's financial year ending in May showed a profit of about EUR 450 000.
The Union describes its economic situation as "turning around", although the economy is burdened by "a significant debt balance".
The Director-General, Mika Kulmala, praises the rapid response and the strict financial discipline.
We responded to the situation last autumn by taking adjustment measures as quickly as possible.
Careful planning and financial management is embedded throughout our organization, Kulmala said in a statement.
We have also been very successful in finding partners and, in addition, the World Cups were at their peak last season.
However, we must continue to manage costs carefully and at the same time constantly look for new funding models.
I heard my wife screaming for help, but then it was quiet.
Dozens of bodies lie in the backyard of a hospital in the city of Palun on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi.
Only one building separates them from the area where wounded survivors are gathered to assess their injuries and the need for treatment.
Patients are also being treated outside for aftershocks.
One of the people who moved into the hospital area was a 52-year-old returnee named Baharuddin, who was looking for her son.
Like many Indonesians, he uses only one name.
I have one child, and he's missing.
The last time I spoke to him was when he was going to school, Baharuddin told AFP news agency.
In the courtyard of the army hospital in Palus lay Dwi Haris, who suffered injuries to his back and arms.
He was at a local hotel when the quake struck with his wife and daughter.
The family was invited to Pallu's wedding.
I probably got squeezed under a collapsed wall.
I heard my wife screaming for help, but then it was quiet.
I don't know what happened to her or my baby.
"I hope they are safe", Harris told the Associated Press, according to British media.
Small shops are being robbed.
At the evacuation center, 35-year-old Risa Kusuma, mother of a small baby, tried to calm her feverish baby.
He described the mood in the city as tense.
Clean water is scarce.
Small shops are being robbed everywhere, Kusuma said.
Many of the residents of the town have slept outside or in temporary huts.
Even if the house were somehow standing, aftershocks could destroy it permanently and bury its occupants.
According to the Associated Press, more than half of the prisoners in Palun prison escaped after the prison walls collapsed.
There were about 560 prisoners, so there may be about 300 escapees.
Some of the prisoners at Donggala prison have also escaped, reports The Jakarta Post.
According to the newspaper, prisoners became furious and set the prison on fire after guards forbade them to go looking for relatives who had been affected by the earthquake and tsunami.
The airport has been reopened mainly for rescue flights.
Among the first to land at the airport was an army C-130 transport plane, carrying relief supplies.
Commercial flights to Pula Airport are only allowed on a limited basis.
Pilots are forced to land without air traffic control assistance because the control tower was badly damaged in the earthquake.
It's raining in Finland tonight.
A long rain front spreading westward across the country on the night before Sunday, reports the National Weather Service.
Most of the rain will be in the form of rain, but in central and northern Lapland, some hail or snow may be expected.
The last night's chilly frost is not repeating itself because the temperatures remain higher under the cloud cover.
A cloudier night keeps the low temperatures in check rather effectively.
In the far west, you can briefly visit the frosty side, said weatherman Ville Ilkka.
Sunday morning, the rain area will shift eastward as the morning begins.
In the south and west, it's foggy or semi-cloudy.
In the afternoon, temperatures always fluctuate between 10 and 13 degrees Celsius up to the altitude of Oulu.
The week that begins looks similar in terms of temperatures in the southern and central parts of the country, but the weather is becoming more unstable.
There are wind and wave warnings in effect in the Maritimes.
No actual autumn storms are expected in the coming days, but otherwise, typical autumn weather is expected to fluctuate.
"Autumn is really starting to come", Ilkka said.
Miss Finland finals are not on TV.
IL-TV will be your home for the glamour and glamour of the Miss Finland competition on the red carpet.
The evening news reporters will be broadcasting live on IL-TV from the red carpet of the Miss Finland final from Billnas's pot.
The show starts at approximately 6:50 p.m.
The new Miss Finland will be crowned Saturday from among the ten finalists.
The Miss Finland 2018 final will be held at Billnas's pit in Raasepor.
Before the final begins, you can watch the atmosphere from the venue on IL-TV live.
The live broadcast will begin at approximately 6:30 p.m. and last approximately one hour.
This year, a particularly large number of Miss Finland winners from previous years have been invited to the final.
They are represented by Miss Finland 1998 Jonna Ziprus.
Other members of the jury include the welfare entrepreneur Jutta Gustafsberg, photographer Nadi Hammouda, the CEO of Jounin Kaupan Minttu Murphy-Kaulanen and Katja Lintunen, the news producer for Seiska.
We were hoping she could get into college before she left for Miss Universe .
Dimitri's Russian father and Svetlana's Hungarian mother believed in their daughter's success in the Miss Finland final.
The parents of the new Miss Finland, Dimitri Voronkov and Svetlana Voronkov, proudly watched their daughter's first moments at the top of the crown.
They were waving to the crowd from Pertunma and were going to drive home after the final.
It's a lovely atmosphere!
We believed Erika all the time, but half an hour before she arrived, Svetlana started to get excited, and she laughed.
Svetlana is from the Ukraine and Dimitri is Russian.
Alina speaks Russian fluently, even though she has lived in Finland all her childhood.
Svetlana says that when she was young, Alina was more interested in acting and many other things than in a career.
Alina was often told that when she was so pretty, she should start off as Miss.
But he said he wanted to be a radio host.
It wasn't until later that Alina became interested in beauty pageants.
Her parents wanted her to get into college before she entered the Miss Finland pageant.
And so it was, and finally Alina wanted to graduate from the school before the Miss Universe pageant.
We asked him last year why he wasn't in the race, but he wanted to finish it.
The parents believe that Alina won the contest because she is a healthy example for young people and adults alike.
He exercises a lot and eats healthy.
And Alina likes to be in the spotlight, you can tell.
Alina's boyfriend, Joonas Hurri, is working in Japan and couldn't make it to Finland to cheer for his sweetheart in the finals.
Alina's parents believe that a relationship between young people lasts for a year.
That's the plan!
The parents hoped that the daughter would soon be able to visit.
It's been such a long break from visiting with the missile shots.
I miss you, even though you've been leaving messages.
A young man was killed in a head-on collision in the Bay Area. Police arrested three people.

The police on Saturday did not comment on the course of events or the possible intentional overdriving, citing the unfinished investigation.
Police also declined to comment on whether the arrested persons and the man killed in the crash had any previous acquaintance.
More information on the case will be available at the earliest next week.
Sari Piippo quit her career in Brussels and became a housewife in Finland - the idea of a comic book came to her mind: the lack of drawing skills did not slow her down
The idea for the creature jump started from a statement my husband made when he suggested it as a character in a story I had developed, says Sari Piippo, a cartoon blogger, housewife and former EU translator from Espoo.
Sari Piippo says she was in Brussels working as an EU translator on economic and legal matters until her family returned to the EU ten years ago after the birth of their fourth child.
I've been enjoying being a stay-at-home mom very much.
This has been the best time of my life, but at some point I thought, what would I do when I grow up, when even the smallest child is growing up?
Then in 2014, a comic book came along.
Pippo says that he never dreamed of making a comic book, even though he had read DuckDuck, Tintin and Asterix since he was a child.
I hadn't drawn since I was a kid, but when these Creationist scripts started to be made, things changed.
I started out by writing a few dozen scripts on a desk drawer.
My daughter Viivi Valkama (born 2000) is a talented artist, but I didn't get her involved until the summer of 2016, when I donated Viivi with a drawing board.
His enthusiasm lasted for a dozen strips, and then he had to try it himself, laughs Pippo, who says the comic was a big cheerleader for him.
The drawing board is an easy and convenient tool to try to get something done.
I didn't even try to draw on paper, Pippo tells of his relationship to drawing, which he usually does at night.
I can't stop thinking about scripts, but I don't usually finish them all at once.
It takes even more hours to make a three-screen strip.
I can make a screen at a time and I like to play with the colors.
Starting to draw is always the hardest part because drawing is not my strongest sport.
The Shaggy Pipe says he appreciates the newspaper comic strips of the day, including Scott Adams' Dilbert.
The characters in the organic shed are an L-themed carrot-faced mother with a salad-thick head of hair.
Other characters include Man, Pee, and Twins.
In the organic world, you are what you eat.
The series is inspired by my own life and social media.
The Saree Pipe doesn't like to preach or offer a hard-on, even though he does occasionally talk to the House of Creation.
The piper says she reads the series with her husband and children.
I mean, it's such a great feeling to look at a comic you drew and say, "This is what I did today".
And enough challenges for a housewife!

The lottery millionaire got bloated. These were the real numbers.
No full-hitter was found in the lottery for round 39/2018.
The biggest winners of the evening were seen in the Saturday Joker, which brought in 20,000 euros for Vantaa and Vaasa.
Next week, the lottery jackpot is 3.6 million euros.
We found two straight 6s on the Saturday Joker.
The second prize of €20,000 goes to the winner who played a betting card at the S-Market in Vantaa.
One was taken by a rogue Internet player.
Indonesian earthquake: captain sacrifices himself, refuses to leave cracking tower before getting hundreds of passengers to safety
The Indonesian earthquake has made 21-year-old pilot Anthonius Gunawan Agung a hero.
Agung was left alone in the control tower until he was able to safely escort a passenger plane carrying hundreds of people off the earthquake-ravaged island.
The young man was on duty in the air traffic control at Mutiara SIS Al-Jufrie Airport in Palun when the earthquake struck on Friday.
While others fled from the control tower, Agung refused to leave his seat until he could steer the Batik Air passenger plane off the runway.
In this way, he was able to save hundreds of lives, the Indonesian Civil Aviation Authority told AFP.
Mutiara SIS Al-Jufri Airport on Saturday after the earthquake.
The control tower was squeaking and cracking.
Finally, Agung tried to save himself by jumping from the fourth floor of the tower.
He broke his leg and sustained serious internal injuries.
Agung was rushed to a nearby hospital.
He was scheduled to be flown by helicopter to a better-equipped facility, but he died 20 minutes before the helicopter arrived, an aviation authority spokesman told The Jakarta Post.
The earthquake intensified after the flight took off, eventually measuring 7.5 on the Richter scale.
At least 832 people lost their lives.
The Indonesian Civil Aviation Authority has honored Agung's heroism on social media.
Rehn on the end of Europe's trade war: 'We need to watch the next tweet'
The trade war between the United States and China is reflected in the world economy.
Growth forecasts have been calculated throughout Europe and the Bank of Finland has also slightly lowered its own economic growth forecasts.
In the first session of the European Council, President Olli Rehn said that while the rising tensions do not have a direct impact on European trade flows, they do weaken confidence, which is reflected in business investment decisions.
The situation also applies to exports by Finnish companies.
The Commission is also proposing to increase the number of Member States to be covered by the directive.
It has been able to build a middle ground with the United States and has helped to calm the situation with China and Japan.
Europe does not seem to be falling into a trade war.
I need to look at the next tweet and evaluate it.
We have a rather unpredictable partner heading to Washington, but he said so in the Yale interview.
Europe also has its own risks.
One of these is Italy, the euro area's third-largest economy, which is also one of the most indebted countries in the euro area and the entire western world.
The market reacted strongly yesterday to the Italian government's Thursday evening announcement of a clear budget deficit.
Next year's deficit will be more than 2.4% of GDP.
Rehn is concerned about the situation in Italy.
The government's loan portfolio is 5% non-performing and unmanaged loans are over 10%.
In addition, its public finances are in poor shape and the country appears to be once again exceeding its commitments to its European partners.
The Commission is also proposing to increase the number of EU-funded projects in the field of education and training.
The second challenge for Europe is the UK's exit from the EU.
Rehn hoped it would be okay.
A contentious divorce would have far more negative effects.
Rehn took up his position as Governor of the Bank of Finland in July.
The European Central Bank (ECB) President Mario Draghi will step down after just over a year.
The conversation with his successor has begun.
Both Rehn and his predecessor Erkki Liikasen's name have been mentioned.
It would probably be OK if Finnish names were included, Rehn said, adding that he would not comment further.

The popular Black Box shows, organised by Helsinki Sanomat, will continue again this week.
The rest of the shows will be at the National Theatre on October 2, 8 and 11.
October 23rd, Black Box makes its first appearance at the Tampere Theatre.
There are still some tickets for the National Theatre on sale.
The Tampere show is sold out.
Tickets are sold by Lippu.fi.
During the evening, journalists and photographers will take the stage to tell a long-prepared true story that has never been published before in any HS instrument.
There's something else involved that no one's ever heard of.
"There is a strange spy in Helsinki at night, a touching report from the other side of the world and a telling story about a very topical health issue", says Esa Lilja, one of the producers of the Black Box.
After the performance, the audience will have the opportunity to meet the HS journalists and photographers and continue the discussion.
Helsinki News has been organizing live journalism evenings for three years.
They have been popular from the start and often sold out.
Over 15,000 people have visited the theater.
The black box was awarded the Bonnier Award for journalistic achievement of the year.
The laureates praised the new way of doing journalism and the desire of journalists to get close to their readers.
The Black Box of Spring 2019 will be seen at the National Theatre in March/April.
The show also visits Tampere and Turku.
The show that you'll see then will have a different content than the one you'll see this autumn.
The missing mushroom was found thanks to "an unprecedented experiment"
Finnish police drone expertise world-class: 'We are being asked for training'
According to the director of the Police College, the police can use the drone not only to search for missing persons but also for crime scene investigations and intelligence missions.
On Tuesday, the police in Oulu managed to find a missing mushroom-eater in Rahe with the help of a drone in just a few minutes.
Kimmo Himberg, president of the Police Academy, tweeted about the case, saying, among other things, that "with unprejudiced experimentation and effective training, we are also the best in the world".
Drone is a fairly new thing, and even more so in police work.
There are no statistics anywhere that the Finnish police are masters at using drones.
According to Himberg, there is a strong perception that this is indeed the case.
This has been shown, for example, when Finnish police experiences have been reported at international events.
There is tremendous interest elsewhere, says Himberg.
I'd be very happy to have visitors to see the Finnish police drone operation.
We're being asked for training.
# More and more high #
He said the EU should not be allowed to impose sanctions on the EU.
As noted, in the case of Raah, the missing person was found by drone in just a few minutes.
The Finnish police have already trained hundreds of drone pilots.
Himburg says they're going to be trained.
Drones are already widely used in police work, and their use will become more common and will increase in the future.
I dare say so, says Himberg.
In addition to searching for missing persons, Himburg says, the police can use drones for things like accident or crime scene investigations and certain intelligence tasks.
For example, you have to check an area a little further away where there is a potential for violence.
The drone can then be used for pre-emptive reconnaissance.
Karelian Rugby has risen to the top of the table.
Karelian Rugby celebrated the victory of the 2nd division in Kuopi on Saturday.
The River Ozen were still in the middle of the match 7-12 down to Helsinki Rugby Club, but found the plot in the second period and whispered to the southern guests 26-12.
The 2nd division championship also meant a historic promotion to the 1st division for Karelian Rugby.
The club has played in the top division in the past, but at that time the Finnish rugby league was divided into two levels, the SM-liiga and the multi-sports division 1.
The company is going to take the series, but it's gonna be a lot of work for next winter.
We need to increase the current roster from less than 20 players to 25.
Division 1 also involves an increase in the number of games and longer trips, so the collection of funds must also be in line with this.
The Eagles will begin the season in Montreal, confirms head coach
NHL head coach Claude Julien confirmed on his Twitter account that Finnish forward Jesperi Kotkaniemi will start the season in Montreal.
Montreal booked super-promising Eagles, 18, in the first round with the number three pick in the summer draft.
The forward joined Montreal's practice squad late summer and has put up some strong performances in September practice.
The eagle squid scored a goal in its first practice match.
Head coach Julien praised the Finn for taking big steps in his development after arriving at the newcomer camp.
The NHL playoffs start Thursday night, Finnish time.
Montreal will face the Toronto Maple Leafs in the opening round.
What makes a good leader?
This week in Finland, there has been a lot of talk about leadership.
Risto Siilasmaa, chairman of the board of directors of Nokia, told HS in an interview in his book Paranoid Optimist, in which he highlights his leadership philosophy.
He also criticised the leadership of his predecessor, Jorma Ollilla.
Ollila has vehemently denied the allegations, but previous Nokia reports have also pointed to the inability of executives to work as a team, fear and silence, which in part caused the collapse of the mobile phone business.
The company's rising risk-taking and agility were gone.
The week also saw the Nordic Business Forum, a major business event in Helsinki, attracting the cream of Finnish business to the fair.
In addition to the star of the show, Barack Obama, 12 businessmen took the stage.
Enough with the talk of good leadership.
The legendary management guru Gary Hamel said that a good leader must have the courage to take the company into the future even when the company is doing well.
The problem is, the decisions are made by those who are most emotionally connected to the decisions of the past.
John Mackey, founder of Whole Foods, a chain known for its wide range of organic foods, said that a manager must be able to communicate the company's purpose to all his employees.
And that purpose cannot be solely to make a profit for the owners.
Susan Cain, author of the book Successful Introverts, said that the most successful leaders are those who are humble.
They act calmly, quietly and decisively.
They're often introverts.
Aswath Damodaran, a professor of finance, reminded that the qualities of a good manager must be matched by the stage of the company's life cycle.
When a company is in its early stages, the leader must be able to tell the story on which the future of the company is based.
A company that's grown to maturity needs a leader who knows the numbers.
These lessons were taught at the Nordic Business Forum by 7 500 visitors - mainly Finnish executives.
The danger was that they had a leak of information.
It takes a lot to be a good leader.
That's why leadership often goes wrong, even at the highest levels.
There was also Siilasmaa and Ollila.
They were talking to each other backstage, like comrades.
But they hardly questioned whether they were the right leaders for Nokia at the right time.
And their humility was not easily appreciated by outsiders.
Sara Chafak arrived on the red carpet in a gorgeous dress straight from Los Angeles , spending most of her year abroad .
Model Sara Chafak arrived at the Miss World final in a gorgeous black dress.
The 2012 Miss Finland showy dress also had a pizzine sleeve.
I'm having a little jet lag.
I'm back from Los Angeles.
I'm spending most of my time there, Chafak tells me all about it.
Chafak says he's going to Los Angeles for an audition.
Among other things, he has done commercials.
He describes the work in the United States as interesting, and also similar to Finland.
However, he says that work must be done even harder, since the model's work is always easily replaced.
Chafak says you have to push harder and be aggressive.
Choreographer Sonya Lindfors receives €30,000 live art prize in Copenhagen
The artist Sonya Lindfors won a €30,000 cultural prize on Saturday in Copenhagen.
Lindfors, winner of the Anti Festival International Prize for Live Art, works in choreography, community activism and teaching.
Sonya Lindfors' art is vital to her community.
Her work gives others the opportunity to work and create spaces for dialogue in environments they have previously lacked, the council described the winner.
In addition to Finnish Lindfors, a number of international artists were nominated for the prize.
The prize is awarded annually to an exceptionally strong artist or group working in the field of live art.
Danish police have found a wanted Volvo in a major operation: 'We cannot say what'
The Danish police have carried out a full-scale search and have found the body.
At the beginning of the operation, the Jewish Quarry and the Great Belt Bridge were closed to traffic.
All land and ferry traffic from the island of Zealand to Sweden, Germany and the rest of Denmark was closed.
Police are looking for a black Volvo V90 registered in Sweden.
The IS has reached the deputy head of the Copenhagen police media centre.
The wanted car has been found.
We can't tell you where the car was found yet, Henrik Storm of Copenhagen Police has told Ilta-Sanom.
According to Storm, the black Volvo that he's looking for has no direct connection to the threat.
He says the greatest danger is over.
Danish newspaper Ekstra Bladet reported on the police press conference on Saturday.
The head of the investigation, Jørgen Bergen Skov, was in charge of the silent-woman operation.
He wouldn't say what the criminal code was.
However, Skov said it was a "serious crime".
It was a threat to human life.
We're looking for three people.
Police won't say if they've been arrested yet.
The paper says the ferry restrictions have been lifted.
Copenhagen police also followed the events on their Twitter account.
However, the police say that the general public no longer has any reason to be concerned, as the threat was directed at certain people.
Macedonia 's name has been a source of controversy for decades , but now the people are voting on it in a contested election .
Macedonia, a country in the Balkans, is currently voting on a proposal for a new name for the country.
The agreement between the Governments of Macedonia and Greece provides that the name of the Republic of North Macedonia shall be the Republic of North Macedonia.
Greece has so far used its veto to block Macedonia's bids to join NATO and the EU.
Greece claims that the name Macedonia belongs to its northern province.
The referendum question does not mention the new name but asks whether the voter supports Macedonia's EU and NATO membership by approving the agreement.
The vote began online at least at a school in the centre of the capital Skopje.
Olivera Argirosvka, a retired school nurse who voted, hoped the agreement would be supported.
The referendum will mean change if it opens the doors to Europe and NATO.
It means change, especially for young people, he said.
The name of the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia has been used in official relations since it gained independence in 1991.
The government of Prime Minister Zoran Zaev has campaigned for the agreement to be approved.
The nationalist right-wing opposition, including President Gjorge Ivanov, has called for a boycott of the referendum.
In addition to the result, there is enough to worry about whether the turnout will rise above the required 50%.
The referendum is not binding, but a "yes" vote would give the government a mandate to amend the constitution.
The amendment of the Constitution requires a two-thirds majority of the Parliament.
The Greek Parliament has yet to approve the agreement.
The polling stations close at 8 p.m.
That's a great win!
Robert Helenius has overthrown the Elder Teper .
Robert Helenius faced Erka Teper in the heavyweight division late Saturday night in a professional boxing match in Germany.
The 34-year-old Finn took a measure of his 36-year-old German opponent at the Waldenbuch in Stuttgart.
The main event of the evening was the IBF Intercontinental Heavyweight Championship.
The winner may be eligible to compete in the more difficult, economically significant challenges on Saturday.
Helenius decided the match in the eighth inning, knocking out Teper with a hard left-handed strike.
Teper couldn't get off the floor anymore.
Nordic Nightmare hurt his opponent in the third round when the German started bleeding from his nose.
Helenius and Teper met in the ring for the first time.
They were supposed to fight back in December 2015.
That's when Teper called in an injury and retired from the game.
It was later revealed that the German had failed a doping test twice.
Helenius has 28 professional fights to his name and has suffered two defeats.
Teper, who entered the game as the clear favorite, has won 19 professional fights in his career and lost three times.
Hamilton with a reserve order to win .
The Formula One championship was once again close to being secured as Mercedes driver Lewis Hamilton beat the Russian GP and beat world champion Sebastian Vettel by 50 points (306-256).
There are five races left.
Valtteri Bottas, who started from pole position, finished second.
Last year, Bottas, who won his first race in Sochi, was in the lead for the first half of the race, but Mercedes told Bottas to let Hamilton pass.
Vettel was third, Ferrari's Kimi Raikkonen was fourth.
Max Verstappen of Red Bull, who started from the back row, was fifth.
Two men who assaulted a Jewish man in Joensuu were caught a block away .
Two men beat and kicked a 31-year-old Jewish man in Joensu in the area of Siltaku 12 after 6 p.m. on Saturday.
Police say the men also stole the victim's phone, among other things.
Police located the suspects, a 35-year-old man from Haywater and a 39-year-old man from Ilomans, a block away, shortly after the incident.
They were arrested on suspicion of robbery, police said.
The victim suffered bruising that didn't require a doctor's visit.
Tesla CEO Elon Musk is stepping down as chairman of the board.
Musk has made a deal with the U.S. government.
At the same time, Musk has been fined $20 million for tweets alleging he secured funding to take Tesla off the stock market.
The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has indicted Musk on securities fraud charges.
Musk will remain CEO of Tesla, but the company will also have to pay a fine of 20 million euros if the agreement between the authorities and Musk is confirmed in court.
Canada is fighting against time to reach an agreement on oil with the United States .
Time is running out in the midst of negotiations between the United States and Canada on a free trade agreement on oil.
The United States has set a deadline for Sunday, and the countries' negotiators have been holding close talks over the weekend.
Canada's chief negotiator, Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland, postponed his speech at the UN General Assembly to focus full-time on trade negotiations.
At the urging of President Donald Trump, the United States, Canada and Mexico began negotiations about a year ago to renew the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA).
At the end of August, Mexico and the United States reached an agreement, but no agreement has yet been reached with Canada.
The United States and Mexico are seeking to bring the agreement into force before the inauguration of Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, who won the Mexican presidential election in early December.
Mr. Trump has said that Canada's participation in the agreement is not necessary.
He has previously informed Congress that he plans to sign the treaty by the end of November, with or without Canada.
In view of these timelines, the text of the US-Canada agreement should be ready by Sunday to allow the US Congress sufficient time to evaluate it.
A neighbor thought the candles were a fire in Kakkur . The fire department was called .
The candles burned in a one-story apartment in Kaakkur, Oulu, triggered a fire alarm on the night before Sunday.
A dozen emergency services units were called to the scene in anticipation of a possible fire in a block of flats.
It turned out that the burning candles in the sauna of the apartment building had looked like a fire in the house across the street, and the emergency department was notified.
There was no fire at the target.
Police arrested 11 people after the Honka-HJK match.
Police arrested eleven people on Saturday in Espoo after the men's football league Honka-HJK match, the police department's crime commissar Teemu Värtinen confirmed to STT.
The reason for the arrest was to protect him from crime and disruption.
The arrested were released after the situation had calmed down, Värtinen said.
The arrests were reported earlier by the Evening News.
The game ended 0-0.
After the final whistle, a large crowd of spectators rushed to the stadium from the auditorium reserved for the HJK supporters.
The situation led to pushing and punching between the supporters of the teams.
One of the things that was needed to stop this was a cavalry patrol.
In addition to the airport, the rioting took place in the area of the nearby metro station, where some of the arrests also took place.
I was not there, but from what I saw in the pictures, the situation was unpleasant, Värtinen referred to the rioting that took place in the field.
According to Verti, no criminal charges have been filed as a result of the events.
Tytjevi has been a great success in the SE butterfly swimming world cup, Laukkanen also swam in the final
Jenna Laukkanen and Riku Petahivi have advanced to the finals of the 3/7 World Swimming Cup finals in the Netherlands.
The competition is held in Eindhoven on a short course.
HSS's Pöytäkivi broke his Finnish record in the 50 m butterfly swim, where he was second in the preliminaries with a time of 22.82.
Earlier in September, Pöytäkivi swam in Helsinki, the time of the trip was 22.77 SE.
Ari-Pekka Liukkonen of Cetus from Espoo was 24th in the butterfly swim in a time of 24.68.
Swimming Club Vuokatin Laukkanen was sixth in the preliminary 50m breaststroke with a time of 30.48 and advanced to the final.
In the preliminary round of the 200-meter medley, Laukkanen was 15th with a time of 2.14.25.
Students will perform a rare delicacy: a simplified version of an ancient tragedy called Oresteia , which is visually appealing .
The tragedies of antiquity are a rare delicacy on Finnish stages.
For example, the National Theatre's last performance was in 1988 of an ancient tragedy, Sophocles' Philoktetes.
Now the National Theatre School of Drama is touring the only complete surviving trilogy of plays from antiquity, the Oresteia of Aeschylus.
In the Lavas auki! projects, which began in 2015, the acting students of the University of the Arts work together with a professional director internationally.
This fourth project, like the first, is directed by Mikko Roiha, who lives in Berlin.
Oresteia had its international premiere in Berlin in April.
The reconciliation of the Oresteia by the Roiha summarizes the story of the end of the blood crime of the doomed Atreus family and the birth of the rule of law in a meritorious twenty-minute hour, especially by summarizing the choral parts.
The work manages to be very faithful to the spirit of Kirsti Simonsuuren's fine Finnish (2003).
The dramatic lights and the exposed layout of the theater emphasize a simplified and clear stage thinking.
It's about the dynamics between the performers, who take turns breaking away from the chorus, playing the title roles, and the chorus.
The show uses both double and triple interpreters of the nomenclature.
The actors do not leave the stage at all, so for example, the murders of Agamemnon, returning from the Trojan War, and Cassandra, his war prize, are also performed on stage, contrary to the custom of ancient performance.
Of course, the performance does not emphasize its fidelity to the ancient tradition of performance.
Rather, a modern, faithful interpretation of the text is created before the eyes of the viewer, constantly aware of its ritual roots.
Royha has succeeded in bringing out the master's-level acting students as a tight-knit group, as a single organism, performing in a rhythmic ensemble.
Especially in choral parts, actors who are apt to adopt highly expressive, sculptural group formations are granted their rights naked, only by wearing a white curtain, on stage.
That's very impressive.
Oresteia's tour continues at the Kouvola and Oulu theaters.
Korean manufacturer builds first hydrogen truck
The innovation is starting to show in Europe, in particular thanks to the cooperation agreement with Hyundai and H2 Energy of Switzerland.
Under the terms of the cooperation agreement, which was announced at the IAA in Hanover, Hyundai will supply a batch of 1,000 new models of vehicles to the Swiss company and its partners.
By introducing the fuel cell truck, Hyundai continues to refer to the Nexon and ix35/Tucson Fuel Cell models as a manufacturer of hydrogen vehicles on the road.
With this first-of-its-kind project in the world, we're taking fuel cell technology one step further.
We are also continuously looking for opportunities to expand the market for these vehicles, for example by monitoring the development of the refuelling network", said Hyundai Motor's Vice President In Cheol Lee at the announcement ceremony.
There were several fights in Kajaani .
A man in his early 30's assaulted three men in and outside a restaurant in the center of Kajaani on Saturday morning.
The man first beat a man inside the restaurant, which led to his removal.
Outside, he pushed another man to the ground, and in the absence of the third, the assailant beat him as well.
The police caught the assailant.
At the police station, the man continued to behave aggressively and kicked another officer in the leg.
He also threatened to beat and kill police officers.
They took him to jail to calm him down.
The case is being investigated on three counts of assault and one count of aggravated resistance to duty.
In the center of Kajaani, on Välikad, another incident of assault occurred on Saturday morning.
The victim was assaulted by two men.
First, a Caanian man in his 20s beat the victim.
A short time later, another man knocked him to the ground, and the man who had hit him earlier still kicked the victim.
The assailants were pulled away from the victim by outside forces and the police were called.
But the perps will be gone before the cops get here.
The police ask witnesses to contact the Kajaani police by phone 0295 416 520 or by e-mail at investigata.kainuu@poliisi.fi.
The long-time radio host Erkki Pälli is dead .
Erkki Pälli, known for his long-term journalism, died of cancer at the age of 83.
Radio host Erkki Pälli, 83, has died.
He died of incurable liver cancer, which he announced on his Facebook page in March 2018.
This is the way to go.
The doctor said it, I live day by day, he commented on his condition to the Evening Standard a month ago.
The safety of the trade's aunt and uncle must be guaranteed.
I first got paid for a newspaper story in 1984.
When a story at these annual circles gets a little surprising, it's usually a big story.
When I wrote (Karjalainen, September 27) about the insecurity of retail workers, I was surprised and at times even a little angry.
I also spoke to Erika Kähärä, a work environment expert from the Professional Association of the Services Sector (PAM).
He says the crime statistics don't tell us the real situation.
The problem is growing, although employers say otherwise.
The police only report cases that are clearly considered serious and many real cases of violence go unreported.
"Of course, companies are obliged to keep statistics on their close-in situation under the OSH Act, but these statistics remain for internal use and their data are not collected for anything", he said.
Mental injuries are not just statistics.
The problem with violence has always been that it does not always result in physical injury.
Still, psychological trauma can be far more serious than bruises and wounds.
The distinction between a violent situation and a threatened situation is difficult to draw when even a certain level of aggressive threat must be considered violence - even if no violence was committed.
Too many people are afraid of their jobs when the actual act isn't happening.
Some of the neighborhoods are unrest.
The store has got guards.
When the opening hours of the stores were opened, the media also reported a considerable increase in the impact on sellers' safety.
"At that time many employers arranged security services at least for the night hours and to prevent working alone", Kähärä commented.
When nothing happens, you draw the wrong conclusion.
This seems to have had an effective effect now, but it is creating a new negative trend.
When the security guard kept the disturbances well under control, the idea arose that security was unnecessary.
Now, in many places, efforts are being made to find solutions to eliminate expensive security services.
Mild assault is a criminal offense, and it is understandable that a battered salesman would not want to investigate a criminal who usually lives near the store.
But under the same 2011 law, minor assault becomes a prosecution if it occurs in the workplace.
I think we need precedents now.
The next time a store aunt or uncle gets beaten up, the police should investigate and the prosecutor should prosecute.
If the courts put a few abusers in prison and sentenced them to the hard end of the penalty scale, manners would be cleaned up.
The Commission has already made a number of proposals to this effect.
Heidi Sohlberg texted the church before the live broadcast began: "Sara, Iro is married".
This year, the Miss Universe pageant will not be televised in the traditional way, but will be broadcast on the Viafree website.
The show is hosted by former Miss Finland Heidi Sohlberg and Viasat and Viaplay's NHL and KHL studios host Iiro Harjula.
The backstage and red carpet show is hosted by Janni Hussi.
Before the live broadcast, the three presenter briefed the guests and media on the progress of the program.
At first, Sohlberg asked the audience to give Harjula a standing ovation.
Now all the women scream!
Now, look at this man, our host, Sohlberg, glowing with his colleagues in the cheering crowd.
The front-line competitions are followed by many of the previous years of Miss Finland.
Among others, Sara Chafak and Sara Sieppi sat side by side and Sohlberg threw a little joke in either direction.
Sara, the Irishman is married!
Sohlberg was blinking, looking at the Saroi.
More likely, Sohlberg was referring to the recently divorced Siepp, who laughed at the comment, although he seemed confused at first.
The first time the kidnapper talked about his divorce was in the Evening Standard.
Miss Miss Queen said she doesn't want to go into detail about the reasons for the divorce in public, because it's between her and Roope Salminen.
She said she wasn't in any rush to start a new relationship. She was just going to focus on herself.
I'm focusing on my own stuff and especially starting to live my own life alone, Sara Sieppi said.
Harjulas marriage came to light at a later stage when Sohlberg mistakenly called Janni Hus and Iiro Harjulas a couple.
The trio laughed at the mess.
I mean, was the Irishman married or what?
Janni Hussi was the one who made the mistake.
A northerner tortured his bound open-faced pig by cutting, burning, and feeding it strong sauce
The Northland District Court has sentenced a 34-year-old man from Kokkola to three years in prison for a number of crimes against his ex-wife.
The crime was committed using a belt, cable and a bunch of bandages.
The court ruled that the items in question were lost to the state.
Rank's charge was a rape suspect.
However, the Court of Appeal dismissed this charge.
The charges against Kokkolai were four counts of assault, gross battery, coercion, unlawful threat, deprivation of liberty, gross deprivation of liberty and two counts of assault occasioning actual bodily harm.
The crimes took place between March 26th and May 24th.
After the last acts, the man was caught and imprisoned a few days later.
Last Thursday, the Nordic District Court handed down its verdict and ordered the 34-year-old to remain in Vaasa prison.
There 's no evidence of rape .
The 34-year-old was also charged with two counts of aggravated deprivation of liberty and one count of aggravated rape on May 22.
However, the court dismissed these charges without evidence.
The case was tried behind closed doors.
However, the trial judge gave a public statement of the verdict.
The judge found that the defendant had used violence, threats and coercion against his wife in situations where she had been bound.
The defendant cut his victim with a knife, smoked a cigarette, served him hot sauce, and poured water and coffee on him.
In its judgment, the court ordered the confiscation of the instruments of crime: a belt and cable, bandages, a bathrobe belt, a knife, and a water bottle.
Four Witnesses
The court of appeals held that the parties continued to live together between the acts.
The verdict states that a large number of the most heinous acts occurred at the end of the criminal period.
Four witnesses were heard in court, two women and two men.
The 34-year-old victim will pay compensation for pain, suffering and temporary harm totalling EUR 5,800.
I doubt he has that money, because the convict has debts from his past.
Prison sentence isn't his first.
The evening paper won't release the name of the convict to protect the victim's privacy.
The recent verdict is not binding at the time of this writing.
Europe leads by four points in the Ryder Cup final
European golf professionals captured the lead on Saturday in their traditional hole-in-one against the United States.
Europe leads the Ryder Cup near Paris by 10-6 with 12 doubles games remaining on Sunday.
Europe won three of the four four-ball matches that began on Saturday, and the afternoon's four-ball match was tied 2-2.
The European stars were Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari, who won all four matches they played in pairs on Friday and Saturday.
This was unprecedented for any European couple.
On Sunday, the two will be pursuing more history.
No European player has ever won five points in a single Ryder Cup match, and only three Americans have achieved the feat: Arnold Palmer and Gardiner Dickinson (1969) and Larry Nelson (1979).
HJK condemns violent disruption of fans at Honka match: "Violence is not part of football"
Football betting league team HJK issued a statement on Sunday condemning the disruptive behavior of its supporters at Saturday's FC Honka game in Tapiola.
"We apologize for the events following the Honka-HJK game on behalf of our fans", the statement said.
After the match, about 50 HJK supporters rushed to the field, some of them seemingly trying to pick a fight with Hong Kong supporters.
There was also a fight between supporters.
The organizers did not calm the situation, but needed police and also cavalry.
The HJK said in a statement that the team's players and officials are shocked by the incident.
The events that followed the fight are not in keeping with the traditional values of our 111-year-old company.
"We strongly oppose any activity that could jeopardize the security of match events", the statement said.
The HJK promises to assist the authorities and event organizers in identifying security threats and eliminating leakage.
Fan culture is part of football and it's important to the NHL.
We support in every way possible positive, joyful and encouraging activities in football stadiums.
"Violence is not one of them", the statement said.
A Filipino inventor is flying a drone car to avoid traffic jams .
Mendiola is a Filipino inventor, hip-hop dancer and a kind of Pelle Peloto.
He's now one of a growing number of people around the world who swear by the invention of the flying car, or at least his version of it.
It has competitors such as Audi and Airbus.
But Mendiola doesn't believe in mass production of his device.
According to reports from around the world, the man has spent much of his fortune building his dream.
He started developing his flying car six years ago.
Now he's calling the development version a drone car.
Recently, he claims to have made his first successful test flight, slipping his device over twenty feet.
One of his goals was to avoid traffic jams.
I hope the device will elicit a positive response.
This was just a dream five years ago, Mendiola told the British Daily Mail.
JHL predicts that the workplace struggles that will begin tomorrow will be reflected in daycare, social and health services.
The ban on overtime and shiftwork, which will start tomorrow in the public and welfare sectors, is particularly evident in social and health services and daycare, said JHL chairman Päivi Niemi-Laine.
The effects will be far-reaching and will certainly be reflected in the fact that there will be insufficient staff on site.
Everyone has to figure out how to pick up their kids.
The employer's job now is to make sure that the services are functioning and that no one's life is threatened, Niemi-Laine tells STT.
According to Niemi-Laineen, the shortage of workers was also evident at the beginning of the year, when JHL members were under a ban on overtime and shiftwork due to contract negotiations.
Employers have made it possible through flexibility that staff are not hired but that workers stay on overtime or switch shifts.
This is not yet a labor strike.
It is a matter of the norm for the protection of workers that every worker should be provided with regular working hours and only those hours.
JHL is opposed to the government's intention to ease redundancy protection for small businesses.
Markku Jalonen, the head of labour relations at the municipal employers' association, does not make any preliminary assessment of the effects of the overtime and shift bans.
However, he does not believe they are very revolutionary, although services may deteriorate.
Employers across Finland are aware of this and have made the necessary preparations.
The area is so vast, the social and health sectors and the technical sector, it's hard to say.
The effects can vary widely between industries, regions and employers, Jalonen told STT.
Jalonen says that last week, experience was gained from similar three-day events organised by the local and primary care association Super and the social and health professional association Tehy.
The effects were rather minor.
The JHL overtime and shift ban applies to, inter alia, municipal, church, state and private social and health workers.
For example, family day nurses are restricted to the outside.
The workforce is at this stage almost 100,000 members of the JHL.
According to Niemi-Laine, JHL's actions may last for a long time.
The Union is also prepared for other labour struggles if the drafting of the Law on redundancies continues.
The government should now admit that this is a race against the wall and a hard one.
Jalosen believes that both the ay movement and the government must come to terms with this.
The special thing is that the hard ones are already in the pipeline, even though the proposal has not yet been made.
The Great Barrier Reef is a showcase for children and adults alike , with a gym class that will study the gestures of the roe and the seahorse .
The collective "Big Coral Reef" had its premiere last spring in Hamburg and last Saturday it was performed for the second time in Finland, this time in Kanneltalo.
Like the group's previous works, The Great Coral Reef is a work that is built from start to finish in collaboration with the audience.
However, this time a clearer presentation is also being constructed, which refreshes and crystallises the findings of the earlier exercises.
There's plenty of fairy-tale magic in the play for the child actors.
The child's perspective has been taken into account in the preparation of the work.
Still, the Great Barrier Reef is not a children's play. It is a play for adults and children to do together.
It gives adults insights and insights into how children receive information and make art.
The ability of children to engage in exercise and play together also blurs the distance between adults and children.
The Great Barrier Reef is somewhat like a fairy tale, a gym, and a nature-aware setting, but ultimately it is tuned into a different, inhuman setting around the visit.
The Great Barrier Reef begins with an examination of the movement patterns of corals, as well as of the creatures and fish that live on the reef.
Six different fitness tracks teach the movements of the roe and the seahorse, among other things.
Finally, a show of less than an hour, with music, lights, and bright colors and costumes, will help you to get acquainted with the life of the reef.
The Great Barrier Reef has both divers observing the life of the reef and corals being examined.
And then there are the coral-observing creatures.
The many facets of the look and the observations make the show dense and lively.
Be it the landscape of an organism, an organism looking at the landscape, and another organism looking at the organism or the landscape, and all of this at the same time.
It doesn't seem that difficult for the kids.
In other settings, the group exercises to reach a boundary of thought and action that is challenging to reach when the group is comprised of both children and adults.
On the other hand, the presence of children makes it more meaningful.
After the workshop, a silent demonstration will be held at Sitrator for endangered corals.
The devastation beyond human comprehension should not be allowed to harden, even though it may be difficult to appreciate the importance of exercising one's compassion in the face of further disasters.
In other places, he has built his work to respect the diversity of life, even through political gestures.
There are other generations, there are other consciousnesses, other species and their future generations, for whose wonder and play it clears the space.
Kids grow up too fast. I'm just glad I didn't grow up with smartphones.
Today's children and youth are more irresponsible than ever.
Young people start smoking and drinking more and more younger and younger.
I think kids should be kids their whole lives, not mess up their lives over drugs and sex because everyone else says they do.
I was shocked when my friend told me that she had to pick up her sister in the fifth grade from her "boyfriend" for the weekend.
When she came to pick up her drunken sister, she told me about her sexual experiences that night.
I can't imagine my own sister in the same situation because we've been told and warned all our lives that we can't touch drugs and sex is for grown-ups.
My hope is that today's children will be able to have a decent childhood and not have to grow up too early because of peer pressure.
I keep seeing on Instagram, younger and younger girls, with pictures of them wearing makeup and showing off their clothes.
Snapchat is used to take and share revealing photos at night.
It's getting harder for the girls to guess their age.
Today's 13-year-olds can easily look 18 and older.
My childhood was all about playing in the woods and board games.
I'm just glad I didn't grow up with smartphones.
I got to be a kid for many, many years, and not have to worry about what other people think of me.
General: Authorities have told the government that the case of the Pearl of the Air is not related to national security
Ilkka Kanerva, who interviewed Ylen, said that the protection police and the defence forces had informed the defence and foreign affairs committees earlier this week.
The Finnish government has been informed that the investigation into the Helmet is not currently related to national security, but to organized crime, Yle reports.
The information from the sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, was confirmed to Ylle by the chairman of the Defence Committee, Ilkka Kanerva (chef).
Kanerva said the Defence Forces and the Protection Police visited the Defence and Foreign Affairs committees this week to report on the ongoing investigation.
This is considered primarily as economic crime.
They were quite strict about not speculating that there was anything else", Kanerva commented in an interview with Yle.
According to Yule, so far, no evidence of a national security connection has been found in the material seized, but the investigation is still in its infancy.
We have no way of knowing what it will reveal, says one of Yale's interviewees.
The extensive house searches that began a week ago on the Turku archipelago and mainland have raised the question of whether the investigation is merely about economic crime or a threat to Finland's internal security.
The Evening Standard compiled a story earlier this week that reviews arguments for and against the idea.
Video: A dream goal saved Liverpool from a losing series
Liverpool's 100 percent start to the Premier League came to an end, but they were still a more contented team with a 1-1 draw at Stamford Bridge.
Sunday marks exactly one year since Manchester City came to Stamford Bridge and went 1-0 away.
And that's when Pep Guardiola's combination sent a signal to the entire Premier League that City were serious.
Everybody remembers how last season ended.
And I'm sure Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp came to West London with the same idea.
The Reds had started the season with six straight wins in the league.
Liverpool started stronger and Virgil van Dijk in particular seemed to be in control of his own end of the pitch.
Chelsea, on the other hand, had a great away League Cup win at Anfield Road on Wednesday.
That's when Eden Hazard came off the bench to decide the match with a spectacular individual performance.
Now, of course, Hazard was in the game from the first minute.
In the 25th minute, he scored first in a small space, a trio with Mateo Kovacic and Jorginho.
Finally, the Croatian saw Hazard rush forward and sent him a perfectly weighted pass.
Hazard drove a little bit to the edge of the penalty area, but then he bombed a perfect left foot in the back of the lower corner.
Pool's goalie, Alisson, was a little slow in the shot put, only getting his fingertips on the ball.
Klopp must have felt the loss was slightly unfair, because almost immediately afterwards, Antonio Rüdiger cleared Mo Salah's control from the goal line.
In the second episode, Chelsea gangster Kepa also got into the action.
The goalkeeper quickly responded to Sadio Mane's call and pushed the ball from the base of the post into the corner.
On the other end, Alisson scored a touchdown with a throw that went through Hazard's back.
The best place for the visitors came in the 72nd minute when James Milner found Bobby Firmino with his focus.
However, the brass star's bush was directed toward teammate David Luiz, who saved the hosts' lead.
And that didn't last until the 89th minute when substitute Daniel Sturridge made a free kick from 25 yards.
Sturridge was playing in his old home stadium, and the forward bombed it into the top corner of an irresistible bet.
Liverpool's 100% league start ended in a 1-1 draw, but they are still top of the league alongside Manchester City.
Chelsea are also close to the championship table, two points behind the top.
The clock is moving . The clock is moving .
I remember a decade ago when a newspaper asked various Finnish influencers what divides the Finnish people.
The only answer Juice Widow could think of was "nose-tip".
Some people have a nose-tips in their last name, some people don't.
I mean, a split line can happen anywhere, and here's one of the offers.
Finland has succeeded in getting the EU to abandon the annual clock shift.
Many will agree that the movement of clocks twice a year has been the work of fools and has caused a variety of problems.
In the end, this achievement seems to be the easiest step in the solution, at least in Finland, although it has not been easy.
The most difficult thing now is to decide which time zone you will end up in: the current summer or winter time or some other time zone.
The public can also express their views on the website takepointi.fi.
The survey was opened by the Ministry of Transport and Communications and will be open until Friday 12 October.
There's a lot of discussion going on over coffee tables and social media, and everyone has a say.
The defenders of wintertime justify their position by the influence of morning light on people's well-being and the defenders of summertime by the influence of evening light on people's outdoor recreation and thus on their well-being.
Both sides have strong supporters and good arguments.
Studies have also shown that morning light can rhythm the day and give a person freshness.
On the other hand, if you do not suffer from a particular tendency to wake up in the dark, the light will increase people's movement outside and will allow better opportunities for, for example, autumn yard work.
The amount of extra light after the normal working day has already been calculated per hour.
I'd prefer to take both, but unfortunately, given our position in the northern hemisphere, we can't do anything.
Winters are too dark and summers too bright for many anyway.
Typical of the debate on the subject is that one's view is pushed and the other's view is very strongly opposed.
You don't listen to the other side's arguments because what matters is how you feel about it.
Since almost everyone has an opinion on the matter, it is somewhat futile to try to turn someone else's head.
That's a waste of gunpowder.
It is a very easy subject to debate because it does not require much effort and the reasoning is simply a matter of silence.
This type of debate is usually more intense and equally fruitless.
It's a shame if the wrong choice is chosen, but I guess you'll get used to it.
And it always offers a suitable scapegoat if life seems dull.
Josba fought a close away victory .
Josba's first away game at the Salibandy Divar brought a full three-point series against Nurmo Jymy.
Josba left Seinäjoen for the homecoming with a joyful 6-5 (3-1, 0-3, 3-1) victory.
The grass was still leading with a goal in the beginning of the third period, but Josba was collecting the ingredients and recycling the men in chains.
In a time of 50.47, brothers Eetu and Juuso Lehtiniemi scored the winning goal 6-5
The decisive minutes on the ice were played by both teams in a draw.
The most effective was Juuso Lehtiniemi (2+1).
The second string was also a firepower, as Teemu Tuhinen (1+1), Jere Kaartinen (1+0) and Jere Kettunen (1+0) also hit.
Miika Kosonen (1+0) also scored a goal in the second round.
Joshua has six points after three rounds of play.
The next one is O2 Jyväskylä in two weeks.
The 200th anniversary party at my uncle 's church on Sunday .
The 200th anniversary of Uncle's church will be celebrated tomorrow, Sunday, in a somewhat sad atmosphere.
The fire at the church of the Accelerator a week ago was a shock.
Uncle's church was guarded for two nights after the fire.
Despite the pain, today is still a place to celebrate.
Although no one would like it, Enno's Church is now the oldest church in the Joensuu Congregation.
The church on the hill in the middle of the village has always been the heart of Enno, despite all the municipal and other associations in the world.
The family service starts at Uncle's church today at 10:00.
Then move to the congregation hall to the cattle table.
There's a lot of stuff on the show all day, inside and out.
For example, the church building can be visited under the guidance of Ari Räsäs, a retired elder who served as a congregation elder for 37 years.
The celebration of the birth of the Church also marks the end of an era.
The congregation hall, built in 1982 and now decommissioned, will open its doors for the last time today.
Now we are in a shelter in the former municipal building, says Markku Koistinen, a local farmer.
The congregation hall was destroyed by indoor air problems, but the church has stood firm for 200 years.
Elon Musk resigns as Tesla chairman - fraud charges settled for $40 million
Electric car maker Tesla and its CEO Elon Musk have settled their lawsuit with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
The SEC suspected Musk of committing securities fraud, and Musk was in danger of being sidelined by the company he founded.
Musk will still be allowed to remain CEO of Tesla.
Instead, Musk will be forced to step down as Tesla's chairman of the board for three years.
The company will have to hire an outside chairman of the board.
The musk will also be subject to stricter control.
Under the terms of the agreement, Tesla will hire two independent executives and will have greater control over Musk's communications in the future.
In addition, Tesla and Musk each pay $20 million (about $17 million) to settle the case.
"The decision is intended to prevent further market disruptions and harm to Tesla shareholders", says Steven Peikin, the head of the SEC.
The case began in August when Musk tweeted that he might take the company off the stock market.
Musk also wrote that the company's funding is secured.
The tweet instantly raised Tesla's stock price.
The SEC suspected Musk of committing securities fraud.
The agency said the tweet was false and misleading, and Musk had not discussed the arrangement with other company executives or potential investors.
In practice, the agency accused Musk of misleading investors.
The SEC announced on Friday that it was suing the company and Musk.
The SEC said it's demanding that Musk be fined and banned from running any more publicly traded companies.
The SEC challenge scared investors, and Tesla's stock plummeted.
More than 800 people killed in Indonesia earthquake and tsunami
The death toll from the Indonesian earthquake and tsunami has risen to at least 832, reports the country's disaster agency, AFP.
The death toll is expected to rise as the damage is still being assessed.
According to Vice President Jusuf Kalla, the final figure could be in the thousands.
Friday's earthquake triggered a tsunami that hit the city of Palun on the island of Sulawesi.
A tsunami warning was issued immediately after the quake, but it was quickly canceled.
Officials say almost all of the dead are from Palus, at least for now.
Rescue officials are concerned about the situation in Donggala, near the epicentre, where the situation remains largely unclear.
Already, several people are known to have died.
Crying for Help From Ruins
The Indonesian military has been alerted to help rescue workers search for victims.
President Joko Widodo, who arrived in the affected area today, urged the military to continue the rescue effort without ceasing day and night.
One of the main centres of rescue is a hotel in Palus, the ruins of which are believed to still hold between 50 and 60 people.
Muhammad Syaugi, head of the agency in charge of rescue operations, said that one person was found alive from the ruins of the Roa-Roa Hotel, a popular business destination for business travelers, last night.
We also heard people crying for help, he said.
Syaug said that heavy demolition equipment would be urgently needed in the earthquake and tsunami area.
Many Indonesians have turned to Facebook and other social media to find their missing loved ones.
You in Palus and the vicinity, help.
My friend's family members are still missing, one writer appealed to a Facebook group.
Telephone numbers of politicians leaked to mobsters in Britain
Many British politicians were harassed when their contact details were leaked due to flaws in the app's encryption.
The intruders gained access to the phone numbers of ministers, among other things.
This was an app used by the Conservative Party in government at the party conference.
For example, the Brexit campaigners, the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, Michael Gove, and former Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, were harassed.
Several MPs received harassment calls.
The app's lack of encryption allowed the public to access the profiles of politicians on the mobile app of the Conservative Party Annual Meeting.
The public accessed the profiles using the politician's email address, which was easily accessible online.
When you log in, you can view and edit the content stored on your profile.
Someone managed to temporarily change Boris Johnson's profile picture from a pornographic one to an offensive one.
The profile picture of Michael Goven was replaced with a picture of media mogul Rupert Murdoch.
Dawn Foster, a columnist for The Guardian, described the problem by writing that the meeting app allows you to log into other people's profiles with their email addresses.
Then the user can view the profile's contact information and, say, send messages on behalf of the user.
The meeting app made every reporter, politician and attendee's phone number public, Foster criticized.
The Tory spokesman apologized for the leak.
He said the technical issues were resolved and the app is now running safely.
The ICO, the UK Information Authority, is supporting the leak.
The application was developed by Crown Comms, an Australian company.
The opposition Labour Party criticises the Conservative Party for not being reliable on security matters.
Every week, the audience at The Wall Finland is filled with a large crowd of Polish people clapping
The attentive viewers paid attention to the reactions of the studio audience to The Wall Finland.
The Wall, a fast-moving American format, was launched in Finland last Saturday.
The game show hosted by Heikki Paasonen was filmed in Poland in the same studio where other international productions of the format are made.
The shooting possibilities in the Polish studio were exceptional, for the large 12-meter-high play walls required space.
During the inaugural session, the studio audience of the programme, which was betting on being Polish, was highlighted on social media.
Twitter sparked a debate about whether the Polish people in the studio might understand something about the Finnish game.
The head of the four domestic programs, Unne Ringmunen, will explain the situation to the Evening Standard.
He says that the studio audience includes close friends of the players, other Finns, foreigners living in Poland and Polish viewers.
The audience in the Finnish production consists of international applauders, just like the audiences of The Wall episodes filmed in the same production mode in other countries.
In Finland, too, there are such crowds, so-called professional audiences, who attend the filming of various programmes, Ringmunen explains.
He reminds us that watching the game itself is not so difficult, even if one does not understand the language in which it is played.
The red and green balls falling from the wall are easy to tell apart.
However, for foreign-language studios, there are interpreters who do the translation work.
There are two interpreters who interpret simultaneously for the studio director at all times.
And then the studio manager will instruct the audience and tell them what kind of slaps are being thrown and what the situation is, says Ringmunen.
He compares the situation to the recent treatment of David Hasselhoff in a domestic production.
David Hasselhoff was a part of the talent show in Finland a few years ago.
He was constantly being simultaneously interpreted and knew everything that was said in Finnish in the film, the sum of the rings.
Typhoon Satsuma , which has devastated southern Japan , is moving towards the main island .
Authorities also warn of possible landslides and floods.
At least 50 people have been injured in Typhoon Tram, but authorities say major injuries have been avoided and no fatalities are known at this time.
In the southern island of Okinawa, winds have been so strong that they have turned cars over.
NHK public broadcaster reports that people have been evacuated to shelters and that more than 300,000 households have been without power.
Over 1,000 flights have been canceled and bullet trains are at various stops due to the storm.
The storm is expected to hit near Osaka around noon, Finnish time.
The capital, Tokyo, is not directly in the storm's path, but heavy winds and rain are expected there too.
There's been a cancellation of trains in Tokyo today.
Meteorologists say the tram will haunt Japan until Monday.
The ace sky grew darker and darker
The aces have had a bad first semester.
The sky was almost blacked out as the team lost 3-6 (0-2, 0-3, 3-1) to Vaasa Sport on Saturday.
The Poros now have five straight losses, and their six-round points totals are two.
No ace defender or player on the bottom two chains has scored yet.
And the pressures are increasing all the time.
The sports fans were already in the hall almost halfway through the game.
We've only played six games, and there's no reason to give up.
Of course, you have to be worried because that's how badly we played.
Especially the second round performance was shamefully bad, according to Jarno Kärki, who scored 1+2 on the aces.
The sport, of course, enjoyed the victory.
The team had a game down on Friday night, so you'd think it would show in the making.
Maybe it was, but the Aces didn't know how to use it.
The number of visitors to the bread day continued to grow
The mother of the bread day, Pirkko Hyvärinen, wonders at the size of the audience in the large hall.
Somehow he thought that maybe not this year so many people will come, Hyvärinen reflects in the morning.
In the autumn of 2017, the Tractor Cycle SM competitions were held at the same time as Bread Day, so perhaps the expectations were that the number of spectators could even decrease slightly from the previous year.
The opposite, however, happened: the corridors were clogged before ten o'clock, the vendors said they were out of products, almost 500 more were sold than before the news broke, and Hyvärinen heard that the number of cars had increased.
The estimated number of visitors has been around 6,000, Hyvärinen will tell later this afternoon.
The morning and afternoon sessions were especially busy with family programs, which surely attracted a record attendance.
In addition, Hyvärinen estimates that the event will go even further.
The sellers also make the journey to Lipper from a larger area every year.
This year nearly a hundred presenters, artisans, bakers, and vendors of harvest products had come to the baker's home.
The mother of the bread day, PIrkko Hyvärinen, admired the crowd from the auditorium.
At the beginning of the day of bread, the harvest was blessed.
In the children's series, "The Beautiful Bread of Teja Kiviniemi" won the audience vote.
The children's baking contest received 11 different kinds of bread.
The winner of the rice cake contest, Marjatta Vepsäläinen, spent the day at the martes' pie shop.
Seven times the brightest light. That's how you know a good lamp.
Bring the space to life, create the right atmosphere for the decor, and read the book without tiring your eyes.
You know, it's worth the investment to get good lighting.
So we've put together three good reasons to invest in lighting.
The tips were given by Innolux's sales and marketing manager, Tarja Jokiniemi.
Do your eyes a favor.
The more years we live, the more important the Enlightenment becomes.
Adequate light can help with problems that many face as they age, with decreased vision and increasing blindness.
The need for light also grows with the age.
A 60-year-old needs three times as much light as a 20-year-old.
So it is worth investing in the therapeutic effects of light and the properties of the lamp for health reasons.
A good light gives enough light, but it doesn't dazzle, Jokiniemi suggests.
Create beauty around you
The only way to bring out the beauty of your home is with the right lighting.
The decorators of today can afford to choose.
The popular style is the Japandi, a blend of gesture, Scandinavianism, and Japaneseness.
On the other hand, the modern and playful retro style, inspired by the 70's, with its bold colors, metallic hues, and ice cream colors, has also seen a boom.
Authenticity is as compelling as any other home decor.
Now the materials are wood, concrete, ceramics, paper, leather, and bamboo.
Show your personality
On the other hand, more attention is being paid to the home than ever before, and interior decoration has become a way of expressing oneself.
Instead of mass-produced, they want a customized, bold light in their home with a story to tell.
People are clearly looking for Finnish and Nordic products whose origin and designer are known.
So we're very design conscious, says Jokiniemi.
You may not buy the latest trendy lighting fixtures for your home.
Certain timeless, jewelry-rich and elegant classics keep their appearance year after year, Jokiniemi says.
Thank you and goodbye.
KooKoo showed the door to the Canadian striker after three games
KooKo and the attacker, Brendan O'Donnell, are parting ways.
The Canadian striker played a total of three League games in the Orange Cup without scoring any goals, KooKoo reports in a press release.
Mr O'Donnell joined KooKo in August on a one-year contract, which included a trial period until the end of September.
Last season, the 26-year-old forward played in the KHL for Kunlund Red Star and the KHL farm team in the VHL for KRS Heilongjiang.
We have no word yet on O'Donnell's new company.
The player wants to set an example in recycling. Goods are going out into the world in recycling bins, plastic replaced paper.
The specialist games shop Glejmannen now recycles not only games but also packaging materials.
The products of the customers of the stone shops are no longer packed in plastic bags but in paper bags made of recycled material.
Products ordered from online shops are packed, for example, in packaging supplied by importers.
All packages that come in here are recycled.
We may use boxes ten times as long as the package is in good condition to use it, says Ville Puurula of Oulu's Game Man.
The company mainly uses newspapers and other similar recycled materials as soft material.
Bubble doors are avoided as much as possible.
In the near future, we plan to move to recycling envelopes.
The movement wants to set an example for others.
According to Puurula, recycling is not an extra effort.
It's not a big deal to start recycling.
It also brings financial savings, for example by reusing cardboard packaging.
Recycling is a natural fit for the activities of the Game Man, as the core product range of the store includes, in addition to new products, used games and equipment.
Sourcing every fashion conscious: one shirt that works on every outfit
Classic clothes work from season to season in both outfits.
Their versatility makes them a good wardrobe base, since it is easy to assemble a variety of garments around high-quality classics at a low cost.
The most popular classics in the fall wardrobe are high-quality needles.
This category includes black polo.
Black needle poles made of natural material shall not be defective.
The garment can be combined with straight pants, a draped skirt, or jeans, creating a restrained outfit or a more casual style.
The polo shirt is suitable for both the young modern dresser and the classic sophisticated stylist.
That's how you create style.
The fall trend line is born from gold-brown and wide-sleeved jeans, black polo shirts, and gray anklets.
The classic polo skirt, along with the other classics, the blue-green scotch-and-wine-red loafers, form a feminine and sophisticated outfit.
Add to the black polo shirt by combining it with casual, trendy outfits - jeans, high boots, and thick socks.
Young and classy!
Russian intelligence has a long history of sabotage.
There is no reason to believe that the SVR or the GRU of the Russian Federation have abandoned this approach.
During the Soviet era, the so-called DRG groups specialized in sabotage.
The name is derived from the Russian words diversionno-razvedyvatelnaja grupa: sabotage and intelligence group.
The Soviet secret service's agents in the West were preparing detailed plans for important sabotage sites, says Vasili Mitrohin (1922-2004), a KGB archivist who defected to the West.
His information was published in books by Christopher Andrew in the late 1990s and early 2000s.
The targets included ports, shipyards, large dams, oil refineries and gas pipelines.
In Germany, the KGB provided the DRG with uniforms and equipment for the Bundeswehr, railways, wildlife guards and road workers for covert operations.
The Russian paratroopers in Crimea used this trick in February 2014: they dressed in local riot gear of the Ukrainian police, set up checkpoints on the roads leading from the peninsula to Ukraine and isolated Crimea from the mainland.
During the Cold War, agents hid supplies packs of mines, explosives, lighters and communications equipment in the countryside for sabotage groups.
Back in 1998, a KGB cache was discovered in Switzerland, and its envelope exploded when the authorities sprayed it with water cannon.
Police picked up four DUI's in the county last night.
Police in North Karelia arrested four drunk drivers on Friday and Saturday night.
In Riensu, an 18-year-old man from Contigo Gulf blew out 1.57 barrels.
He drove at 2:30 in the morning to the start of the Kajaaninti, carrying two passengers.
On the Kooreaarianti of the Koori lake, a car plunged into a ditch at about four o'clock in the morning, and a 19-year-old local man, alone in the car, blew out 1.54 permiles, police said.
He didn't get any serious injuries from the fall.
In the center of the Outokumpu, a 20-year-old out-of-towner driving a passenger car blew 1.33 per cent into the alchemical.
Police suspect the male drivers in question of gross drunk driving and the driver of the Kolvijärvi as well as endangering traffic safety.
Saturday morning in Tuupovari, at the intersection of Öllölandi and Hoikanti, a 36-year-old local man driving a van blew out 0.52 per cent.
He's a suspect in a DUI.
Police are requesting a statement regarding a stabbing incident at Turku railway station just after midnight.
Police say the man was assaulted in a parking lot outside the station with life-threatening consequences.
The act was caught on a security camera.
The suspects, dark-haired, dressed in dark trousers and a brown or beige coat, left immediately after the stabbing in a dark station wagon heading for the Ratapihankatua bus station.
One of the suspects left on his bike on Humaliston Street heading downtown.
A pedestrian died after being hit by a bus in Pori .
A pedestrian in Pori died early Saturday morning after being hit by a bus.
The accident happened just after 4:00 a.m. on the Rauman Road near Niittumaa.
The driver of the van is not suspected of any crime.
Police are investigating the events leading up to the accident.
HPK will keep Riska in the lineup for the rest of the season.
Mika Toivola, the head of the Hämeenlinnan HPK, says that Filip Riska (center) has been important to the team in the starting lineup, underpowering and defensive role in the fourth quarter.
Filip Riska, who played in the test season at the beginning of the winter, will continue in Hämeenlinnan HPK for the rest of the season.
The success of the experienced Riska, 33, in the roles offered to him convinced the management.
Filip has been a big part of our offense, underdogs and defensive quarterback.
Although there is still room for improvement, the young team is well advised to keep such an experienced player, said HPK sporting director Mika Toivola in a club press release.
Hopefully, the value of Riska will increase when the NHL playoffs are played.
Riska is a centre-forward from St. Petersburg. He has previously played for JYP, Lukos and Sport.
Forward Oskari Lehtinen, on the other hand, was left without a contract after the trial.
On the news tonight , a climber was left for dead twice .
American Beck Weathers wrote a book 18 years ago.
Left for Dead: My Journey Home From Everest is based on the man's own experiences.
Tonight's movie is based on them.
Everest is now premiering on Finnish TV.
In May 1996, a devastating blizzard surprised climbers on Mount Everest.
The 2015 film directed by Baltasar Kormákur is a story about a struggle for survival that has been treated with grain.
The tragedy has been made into films and documentaries before.
We're going through real events in this case, too.
Twenty-two years ago, the world's highest mountain claimed the lives of eight climbers.
Two of them were experienced expedition leaders, Scott Fischer and Rob Hall.
It was Hall who was Weathers' guide.
Weathers' life may have been saved by an eye operation performed before he left for Nepal.
As a result of this and the pressure of the air, he lost his sight and the summit was not to be conquered.
Rob Hall went on his way and never came back.
However, Weathers' struggle for life and death had only just begun.
When the storm came, he got lost and never found his way back to camp.
When the search team arrived, they found him in such a bad condition that they did not believe he would survive.
Weathers was left for dead.
But miraculously, he was able to get back on his feet and find others.
Weathers, who had frozen to death, was thought to be still dying, and once again he was left to his own devices.
What is clear is that, contrary to popular belief, Beck Weathers survived.
At some point, even his fellow climbers began to believe in the possibility of his being helped.
In the film, Beck Weathers is played by Josh Brolin.
Rob Hall is Jason Clarke and Scott Fischer is Jake Gyllenhaal.
Other appearances include Robin Wright, Keira Knightley and Emily Watson.
Today is the 200th anniversary of the church of Enno.
Uncle's 200-year-old church was celebrated today on Church Hill.
The church was dedicated on October 4, 1818, and a family feast was prepared for Sunday in honor of the jubilee year.
The celebration began at 10 a.m. with a family service on Enno's church hill, followed by a cattle meal at the Enno's parish hall.
The church was full.
The family survey was attended by 517 people.
Uncle's minister, Iron Mountain, was happy that so many people had come to church.
It is a great joy for a long time to come and gives strength to the work, says Iron Mountain (pictured).
The fire in the Church of the Ascension has touched many, and it was not ignored during the celebration of the Enon congregation's 200th anniversary.
Uncle's Church is now the oldest Evangelical Lutheran church in Joensuu after the church of the Exaltation was destroyed by fire.
The wooden church of the Accelerator was completed in 1770.
In the heat of the moment, a morning service was held to silence and remember the church destroyed by fire.
Photos and videos: A doctor shows his power in Greece - the sea disappears and the street turns into a river
A powerful hurricane-type storm struck southwest Greece on Saturday.
The Mediterranean hurricane, or Medican, is named Zorbax.
The Greek Meteorological Institute has issued a red weather warning for the regions of Attica, Peloponnese, Ionian Islands, Cyclades and Crete.
Images taken from the area show heavy flooding throughout Greece.
A video posted on Twitter shows how a river has suddenly appeared between houses in the town of Kiaton in the Corinth region instead of a street due to flooding.
Another video shows a car washed away by the floodwaters.
In the southern part of the Peloponnese peninsula, strong winds caused heavy seas.
The Finnish Embassy in Athens is advising people on its Facebook page to prepare for a storm in Greece.
The embassy urges you to follow the weather forecast and the instructions of the local authorities.
A Mediterranean hurricane, or medican, brings heavy rains and even flood hazards.
According to CNN, a study published in 2011 found that medical emergencies occur only once or twice a year worldwide, typically between September and October, when sea temperatures are still high.
The storm, now blowing, left its trail of flooding in Tunisia and Libya before continuing northward and into Europe.
In Greece, there have also been concerns about refugee camps on islands such as Lesvos.
The thousands of Syrian and Iraqi refugees living in the camps have limited access to adequate protection.
The storm also affects areas around Athens that have been ravaged by fires in the summer.
In Greece, the medic was also raving last November.
The sea is not safe, but the flights are still on schedule. Thousands of Finns are currently on holiday on the Greek islands, which are threatened by a winter storm.
Sea trips are canceled, and even when walking, be careful not to let branches or other loose material fly over you in a storm.
These are the guides who gave instructions to over 3,500 Finns who were on holiday in Greece during the weekend.
The instructions are needed as a storm of even the most terrifying magnitude, Zorbas, is predicted to hit the Greek islands this weekend.
For example, near the island of Crete, wind speeds in the bush can reach up to 150 feet [45 m] per second.
The weather is getting worse with heavy rains.
All travelers from Finland via the Sunny Voyage and Tuin from Greece who have provided their phone number have been warned by text message about strong winds, according to the tour operators.
♪ Still in the air, sunshine and heat ♪
According to Inka Ikosen, an expert in solar travel communications, the worst has been avoided in the resorts by early Saturday evening.
For example, flights have landed and taken off on the normal schedule.
Of course, we'll be monitoring the situation at all times.
We're putting security first.
Antonia Schroderus, a media supporter, says that their flights have also been on schedule.
We're in constant contact with our personnel on the ground.
At least Crete was still quiet, he told me Saturday night.
The most popular Greek islands, Rhodes and Crete, currently have a total of just over 1 500 Finnish passengers.
In addition, a few hundred travelers are vacationing in smaller destinations.
For example, the worst storm on Kosin Island will reach Sunday morning.
On the other hand, on Saturday afternoon, the sun had been shining on Rhodes and the temperature had dropped to 90 degrees Fahrenheit [27°C], says Ikonen of the Sun Journey.
Zorbax is projected to move into the Turkish Rift next, albeit with some easing.
We have already contacted Turkey and our staff there, and checked, for example, the number of Finns flying to Antalya on Tu, says Schroderus.
Shirly Karvis and Janni Huss in perfectly identical evening gowns in the Missis Finale . This is how they reacted to the situation .
As a media personality and fitness beauty Janni Hussi arrived at the Miss Finland final on Saturday in an open-backed evening dress.
Hussi says she got the dress from Meslew.
I went to the store and decided to trust the professionals who found me the perfect dress for tonight.
The very same silver evening dress was chosen by the host, Shirly Karvin.
The twins themselves noticed their similar outfits and laughed at the situation.
Karvinen told the Night-Sano that he was in a hurry to prepare and had to get on a plane.
Hussi will be the backstage and red carpet host for the Miss World final, and he'll be talking to the stars of the front row.
Huss has a recent move in the past, because he moved from Kamp to Rock Island on Friday.
I'm gonna stay there for now, see what happens.
The important thing is that the new apartment has its own study, Hussi thought.
Before moving, Hussi was on holiday alone in Greece.
It was lovely. I was only in a hotel for a week.
During the stressful outburst, I caught a cold, but otherwise the holiday was a real success, Hussi says.
Shirly Karvisen 's behavior on the plane attracted a lot of attention , attracting the curious eyes of the retirees .
The presenter and Miss Finland 2016 Shirly Karvinen said on the red carpet of the Miss Finland final that she had enough to do with radio news and Love Island Finland coverage.
The rush has been enough, even to the point where Karvinen has reached the final directly from a Finnair flight.
I put on my makeup and my hair on the plane.
This is the glamour.
I'm changing my nightgown at home, and Hair laughs.
The hairy one says she wore her makeup to the pensioners.
His preparation also caught the attention of his fellow travelers.
I had a big mirror and I could see people's eyes in the mirror.
I mean, I was funny, at least in the eyes of the others.
The furry one flies to Spain once a week.
In Marbella, he spends a few days at a time.
Karvinen says she enjoyed her time as host of Love Island Finland.
He describes his experience so far as also being a stopgap.
And Karvinen says she went to the singles' show on Friday.
It's kind of raw in a way.
It's a real human emotion, and the hairy one describes the feelings of the singles on the show.
How do I wear my high-heeled shoes?
Three Perfect Examples
Classic clothing is a type of clothing that works from season to season in a costume.
Often the classics are decades old, but sometimes they can accommodate more modern individuals.
A few years ago, the high-heeled boots that became the fall and winter hit have gone nowhere.
True to its name, knee-high boots are a style that repeats itself from year to year and from season to season.
Shoes that look good will divide the wearer, but a bold design is worth trying, well, bold.
Because knee-high boots are suitable for practically any outfit.
Whether it's jeans, jeans, jeans, jeans, or a T-shirt, the simple leather or synthetic leather on the boots will work.
Long boots look good in party dresses as well as casual wear.
Black high-heeled boots are perfect for even the most modest outfits.
They perfectly balance the femininity of the pink, floral pleats and the sweet, thick needle.
A fresh yet stylish fall casual dress with a romantic flavour.
A strong and slightly retro outfit is made of a long copper-brown velvet suit, over-the-knee boots, showy earrings, and a silk-lined bag.
While high-heeled boots have a certain sophistication, they also go perfectly with casual everyday wear, along with a t-shirt, long shorts, and a trendy tie.
It's so easy and yet so elegant!
Two robotic cars are starting to move in Espoo .
They operate year-round and take passengers on board, the city of Espoo reports.
The robot cars will act as a bus simulator for Otaniemi, as the project to launch a robot bus in the region next spring.
The project will develop and pilot year-round robotic vehicle traffic and test the technical performance of vehicles in Finnish conditions.
The experiment will see how the robot cars will cope with the current street grid.
At the same time, the city offers the opportunity for robot bus developers to develop technology in a real environment, says Johanna Nyberg, Director of Transport Management.
For the first time, robotic cars will be able to drive in the middle of other traffic without any special traffic controls.
The responsibility for vehicle safety is always the secondary passenger.
Vehicles are constantly sensing their surroundings with a number of sensors and assessing whether the lane is clear.
If not, they interpret the detection as a vehicle, a bicycle, or a snowflake, for example", says Harri Santamala, CEO of Sensible 4, which is responsible for robotic traffic development.
The robot cars will run three days a week throughout the autumn: Tuesdays from 1 to 3:30 p.m., Wednesdays from 10 to 10 p.m. and Thursdays from 10 to 15 p.m.
The robot cars will stop at six stops along the route and pick up passengers.
You can tell when a robot car is stopping by looking at the stop sign.
The safest way to get on board is at the number 1 station on Otaka Island.
The bassist of Mokoma fell off the stage in the middle of a gig and was injured.
The Mokoma group is announcing on their Facebook page the surprising situation at the Tampere's Frozen Room gig.
Mokoma's gig at Tampere's Pakkahuone had a dramatic turn on Saturday when the band's bassist Santtu Hämäläinen fell off the stage during a performance.
It happened when the band was playing the last song of the night.
The wrist of the fuzzy one broke.
The band will be announcing the news on their Facebook page.
"We are alive!"
The guy tripped on stage in the fridge last night in the last song and broke his wrist.
We wish the metal brother a speedy recovery!
The rest of the tour is gonna be run by a backup crew, it says on the page.
Fans of Mokoma are responding with concern to a photo update of bassist Santtu lying on the bed with a cast in his hand.
This news has been expected, there was quite a concern about how bad it was.
It's a big relief. Fortunately, your bones heal with time.
A speedy and speedy recovery for Santa and a happy tour for the rest of the band plus the sponsor!
And thank you for yesterday, it was a great show, but do you promise to keep this kind of dramatic ending from the show in the future?
Police were monitoring the hunt in North Karelia and Savoy.
The Eastern Finland Police Department carried out hunting surveillance on Friday and Saturday with the Forestry Administration and the Finnish Game Center in North Karelia and Ylä-Savona, police department officials said on social media on Saturday.
The main focus of the control was on the legality and permissibility of hunting.
Each hunter was checked for a hunting card and a hunting license, which is required on state lands.
The Commission also examined the permits for hunting weapons and the authorised quantities of cartridges for self-loading weapons used in canning.
The police said that 112 hunters were checked during the inspection and only one hunter was found without the required hunting permit.
The hunter was fined 12 days for unauthorized fishing.
In addition, police blew up 133 drivers, two of whom are suspected of drunk driving.
In addition, the patrols handled five traffic offences in the context of fines, police cases.
In conclusion, the hunters are very good at enforcing the law.
Many hunters were surprised by the surveillance.
One hunter said that "I have been hunting in the area for 50 years and this was the first time anyone had checked the permits".
The police in Eastern Finland will continue to monitor hunting in the autumn together with other supervisory authorities.
Mykkänen to Turkey to monitor the selection of Syrian refugees for the quota
The report also calls for the EU to be involved in the fight against terrorism and calls for the EU to be involved in the fight against terrorism.
Finland has decided to take in 530 Syrian refugees from Turkish refugee camps this year.
The selection visits are usually carried out twice a year and involve representatives of the Immigration Service, the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Employment and the police.
The delegation is already in Turkey for interviews.
The UNHCR, the UN Refugee Agency, first selects people who are particularly vulnerable.
In practice, it has referred to people who are considered to be in a particularly vulnerable position in refugee camps, such as single-parent families, the disabled and sick, women and children.
The number of people selected for the group exceeds the quota, as in practice some do not arrive for various reasons.
The EU has also been involved in the negotiations on the accession of the Republic of Moldova to the European Union.
The trip is also accompanied by the head of the interior ministry's office Ilkka Salmi.
The increase in the quota is discussed
Finland has been taking quota refugees since the 1970s.
In recent years, the quota has been 750 refugees a year.
The quota was 1050 for a couple of years, but the government has not agreed to raise it since.
The Assembly has been in favour of increasing the quota, but the project has recently fallen under the resistance of the blue.
The Commission has also proposed that the EU should be allowed to use the quota for the first time in the year 2000.
The visit by Mr Mykkäs is the first by the Minister of the Interior to the site during this government to monitor the selection of quota refugees.
The Commission is also proposing to increase the number of EU-funded projects in the field of education and training.
Finland receives an EU grant of EUR 10 000 for each particularly vulnerable refugee.
Now we're going to the pits. We don't know whether to laugh or cry.
Last Saturday, the local news reported on a bill to amend the Animal Welfare Act.
The article was interpreted as prohibiting in principle the keeping of all animals as livestock, pets or otherwise for business purposes, which are not specifically authorized by ministerial regulations.
I would like to say that everything else is prohibited in principle, except for the animals specifically mentioned in the regulation.
If this bill becomes law, it will mean that we are abandoning the general principle in Western democracies that the law specifically prohibits activities that endanger the security of society or good manners.
We are now in the process of establishing a ban on all activities which are not specifically authorized by law or regulation.
The change means that nothing new can be tried, for example in business, and nothing else can be done until a law or regulation approving it is passed.
The government's role in legislative development has generally been weak.
If we now go down the road of prohibiting everything in Finland that is not specifically allowed, we no longer know whether to laugh or cry.
I have no doubt the Animal Welfare Act would require an update.
But this kind of legislation is not a democracy.
I am sorry, but I am not very familiar with the Constitution, but I wonder if it would accept such a procedure of "anything is prohibited that is not specifically permitted by law or regulation".
I hope there's a sensible minister who can stop this bill from moving forward.
Metti Forssell gives us a hint: the four most fashionable skirts of the fall.
This fall's trend is snake outfits.
It looks particularly good in skirts.
Combine the snake skirt with more restrained tops, such as a polo or a regular T-shirt, to keep the outfit stylish.
Silk is abundant this fall, and silk skirts in particular are one of the most fashionable garments of the season.
Combine a beautiful silk skirt with a feminine top or relax with a knit.
You can play with silk-hair even more boldly and throw on your shoes, such as sneakers or fall-fashioned cowboy boots.
Whether gray, brown, or multicolored, all square skirts are now a must-have for every woman.
Bravely combine different colors and play with the box, even with the different colors on the top.
For example, a box of chocolates and a ball of chocolates are beautiful.
The asymmetrical beads are a breeze of summer lightness that can be carried into the fall.
The asymmetrical pearl is at the same time feminine and playful, and it is a fine fit for both everyday and festive occasions.
Baby Alexia, three months, sweetly grumbling in Jere's arms
In the family photo of the Karabakh Gulf, the center of attention rises to the adorable three-month-old baby Alexia.
Nanna Karalahti tells us about the Authentic Day Care Centre founded by the Crow.
Sports entrepreneur Nanna Karalahti, 30, and former hockey player Jere Karalahti, 43, were joined by a new family member in early July.
The couple's first son, Jax, turned two in May, while little Alex is only a three-month-old baby.
Nanna Karalahti recently held a training camp with Martina Aitolehti in Marbella, Spain, with the entire Karalahti family in attendance.
Nanna posted a picture on Instagram of the Spanish mood, with the entire Karalahti family posing.
The children, Jax and Alexia, are in the arms of their parents.
Attention is drawn to the sweetly mournful baby Alexia, resting in Jere's arms.
I'm grateful for this.
Grateful for the goodness, forgiveness, generosity and joy of people, writes Nanna Karalahti in the family portrait column.
Nanna Karalahti, who has recently become a public figure from the fitness diary program, and ex-ice hockey player Jere Karalahti recently went into daycare business and opened Aito-daycare center for the Crow.
In addition to the Karalahti, the company also includes food expert Johannes Laine and Hanna Liisanantti, who is responsible for education.
Johanna Tervo was hired to run the day care.
Turkey urges people to charge their phones in case of a storm
Storm Zorba, which hit Greece on Saturday, is expected to move into Turkey on Sunday.
Meteorologists warned sailors, fishermen, and farmers on the west coast of Greece about the storm on Saturday, reports CNN Türk.
A tropical storm is reported to move along the coast from the south to the north during the day.
Disaster and emergency officials urged citizens to charge their cell phones before the storm and ensure Internet connectivity so that people can get updates, local news agency Anadolu Ajansi reported.
People have been advised to stay indoors and away from windows and to move furniture, such as garden furniture, out of the way of the wind.
Heavy rainfall is expected in Turkey and winds are expected to reach 28 to 33 meters per second.
Red weather warning in Greece
On Saturday, the Greek Meteorological Service issued a red weather warning for southern Greece in the areas of Attica, Peloponnese, the Ionian Islands, the Cyclades and Crete.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the travel agencies organizing trips to Greece warned Finns in Greece about the Zorba storm.
The Finnish Embassy in Athens also issued a storm warning.
Travelers were advised to follow weather warnings and instructions from local authorities.
A little while ago, when I contacted you, it was very windy and raining.
People were calm, said Laura Aaltonen, communications director at the TUI travel agency, to STT on Saturday.
Aaltonen described the situation as similar as late as Saturday night.
By evening, the Foreign Ministry had also received no messages from Finns in distress.
In Greece, several ports were closed to shipping on Saturday, local news agency Amna reported.
All sea trips were cancelled on Saturday, travel agencies told STT.
According to the Finnish Embassy in Athens, temporary disruptions to air and sea traffic were expected.
Finnair said on Saturday that they were actively monitoring the weather.
Kimi Raikkonen has crystallized the reason why Mercedes is better than Ferrari
Ferrari's Kimi Raikkonen was forced to admit that his worst rival, Mercedes, was too tough in the Russian GP times.
However, there is no need to panic in the Ferrari camp, the experienced driver judges.
They were just faster than us, but it's not like it's a huge thing.
Our car was the best in terms of times all weekend so far, but they were just too fast, finished fourth and with team-mate Sebastian Vettel clearly outpaced the Mercedes, said Räikkönen.
Ferrari had a tough time last race in Singapore.
The robber was asked what caused the sudden fall from the Mercedes.
They seem to be going faster than we are, it's as simple as that.
If I knew why they were doing that, I'm sure we'd be going as fast as they are.
But I don't know that any more than anyone else.
This is a guessing game, and it looks like they're ahead of us now.
Who knows why?
In the past, there was a rare taste for the future Sauber from the Raikkonen stable.
In the first season of the race, Charles Leclerc, who replaced Raikkonen at Ferrari, was seventh, and Marcus Ericsson also made it to the final time trial.
For a Swedish driver, the tenth place is the best in over three years.
And even though in the second session, as many as five drivers missed the race entirely, the result was still a tasty one for Sauber.
And maybe a little encouragement for the little bugger, considering what's coming?
Yes, compared to where they were from the beginning, it's been a big step forward.
Next year's a different story, so we'll see, we'll see.
That's it. Robert Helenius knocked Erka Teper out with "Robbe is back".
The match between Robert Helenius and Erka Teper in Stuttgart tonight went to a draw.
The German was the more proactive side in the ring, but he didn't get the right shots.
The more decisive Helenius controlled the match with his hard sets, which were well-placed.
The Finn was also in a much better physical condition than Teper.
The decision finally came in the eighth inning, when Helenius knocked Teper out with his left straight.
The blow was so strong that the bully who was fighting in front of the home crowd didn't even try to get up off the rug.
After the victory was secured, Helenius vented rather moderately.
In the ring interview, he began by praising the good atmosphere created by the audience and his opponent.
Then he switched to Finnish for a moment.
Thank you to all the viewers and the Finnish cheerleaders.
We brought the belt with us today.
Helenius was so happy right after the fight.
It was a very big win for Helenius' career.
"There might even be a chance to get to the World Cup", Helenius told Iltalehti before the match.
But losing the fight could have ended his boxing career.
Of course it's been on my mind.
"You're not getting any younger", 34-year-old Helenius admitted before the Teper encounter.
The number of victims in Indonesia could double
According to The Guardian, the country's vice president urges people to prepare for a sharp rise in the death toll.
According to the country's vice president, Yusuf Kalla, the total number of victims could be in the thousands.
Difficult Circumstances
Rescuers are searching for trapped as well as dead people in the worst-hit areas of Sulawesi: the port city of Palun and its neighboring town of Donggala.
So far, all the victims are from Palus, and Donggala's situation is still unclear.
Hundreds of people are still missing and some 540 are seriously injured.
There are still people in the collapsed buildings that rescuers have been unable to get out.
For example, the hotel called Roa Roa in Palus has collapsed.
Rescuers report hearing screams from people trapped in the rubble, but the lack of cleanup equipment has delayed rescue efforts.
Indonesian President Joko Widodo has ordered the military to carry out a rescue and demolition operation.
The army and its equipment are needed because electricity and communications are cut in many places in the disaster zone.
We're also running out of fuel.
The hesitant answer of the Miss Finland finalist and the long reflection caused a laughing stock
The next Miss Finland is being selected at Billness Pottery.
In the interview round, each of the finalists was asked a question.
The finalists asked a question from a glass jar on the stage.
Especially the hesitant response of finalist number six, Emilia Anttikosken, 23, caused a sweet but well-meaning laugh from the audience.
The question asked to the questioner had come through Facebook.
User Sparkle-E wanted to know what the last book the missile finalist read was.
The Antti-Chok thought long and hard about his answer before he began to hesitate.
Thank you for asking, Sparrow E.
The last book I read was, uh, Anttikoski said, thinking.
The pause caused a roar of laughter in the audience, until Anttikoski continued his reply:
The last book I read was...
I've read books in school!
It's probably something to do with economics.
So the last book I read is an economics book, Anttikoski said.
After his answer, Anttikoski received a rousing applause from the audience, accompanied by laughter.
Earlier on the Miss World Tour, Anttikoski attracted attention because he didn't want to pose in his underwear because of his principles.
The 2018 Miss Finland crown will be at 21:00, when Miss Finland Michaela Söderholm will give up the crown.
♪ The apple-pear pie of a pig ♪ ♪ Takes away his tongue ♪
This recipe is for those of you who have good sour apples from your own backyard, because the domestic apples are on the market at shocking prices.
You may have to buy a pear, although I think quite a few people already grow a pear knife.
You can also make this cake with only apples if you don't want to buy pears.
Of course, the taste is more varied if the pear is added to the cake.
Peel the apples and pears and remove the seed pods.
It was a knife.
You can melt it in a pot.
Boil the eggs and sugar into a foam, then add the cornstarch and melted butter.
Mix the cornstarch, or maize, with the breadcrumbs and add them to the dough.
Add the almond flour and wheat flour, stir well.
Wrap the bread roll with bread paper, spread 2 tablespoons of sugar on the bottom of the roll and spread pear slices on top of the sugar.
Put half the dough on the pear slices and the apple slices on the dough.
He spit the end of it on the apple cider.
Cook in the oven at 180°C for about an hour until the surface is a beautiful brown.
Let it cool in the sweat, then cancel the waitressing license.
Don't cut the cake until it's properly cooled.
The cake is fragile in structure and easily crumbles because of the gluten-free almond and cornmeal flour in the dough.
The International Crime Fiction Event will be held in Ruka in January.
In January, the first international literary festival focusing on Nordic crime fiction will be held in Kuusamon Rukka.
The Nordic Noir programme consists of interviews, panel discussions and other literature-related programmes, as well as jazz music.
The festival's literary guests include the star of Swedish Dekker literature Jens Lapidus and the Swedish duo Jerker Eriksson and Håkan Axlander Sundquist, who are known as Erik Axel Sund.
In addition to Swedish names, the event will also see writers from Iceland, Norway and Finland.
The Finnish writers are represented by Max Seeck.
According to the festival's organizers, the northern location, nature, dark season and unique environment of Kuusamo provide the framework for a unique literary experience.
Status symbols do not attract friends - Four facts about popularity
What makes a person popular, charismatic, or admired?
Researchers at the University of Sydney, who analyzed the situation, identified two types of "coolness" with slightly different characteristics: the generally attractive coolness and the somewhat opposite dissent-coolness.
Researchers described attractive cool people as having many of the traits considered socially desirable: they were outgoing, friendly, agreeable, and competent.
The dissidents, on the other hand, were characterized by aloofness, independence, rebellion, and fervor.
They were thirsty for experience and little interested in outside judgments.
Both men had a strong sense of self-worth and a stable emotional life.
The role of tough guy is no longer cool: high status in adolescence does not necessarily lead to success later in life.
That is the conclusion of a 2014 study published in the journal Child Development.
Young people who dated early, flirted, joined handsome groups, and sought the approval of others were at increased risk of drug abuse and crime as young adults.
In human relations, they fared worse than their once-unnoticed peers.
Luxury cars, designer bags or watches that convey high status do not make you cool - or at least truly attractive.
In a study published in the journal Social Psychological and Personality Science in August, the majority of people were more likely to befriend a regular market shirt than a designer shirt - even though most chose a designer shirt for the dating scene.
If you're on a Greek island, be careful!
There 's a severe thunderstorm brewing . Weather warnings are in red .
During the weekend, the average rainfall in southern Greece is as much as in Finland during the first half of the year.
Hurricane Zorbas is set to hit Greece this weekend.
Be prepared if you are in the Peloponnese, Ionian Islands, Cyclades, or Crete.
The storm is very strong, so the Finnish Embassy in Athens will announce it on its Facebook page.
The Greek Embassy has issued a red weather alert for the area.
The forecast of the storm is also reported on the Foreca blog.
It says the most powerful blasts of the storm are up to 150 feet per second.
By comparison, the Kuisma storm that struck Finland earlier this week reached its peak with winds of over 100 feet [31 m] per second.
However, the blog says that the biggest concern for Zorbas is not the wind, but the heavy rains.
Over the weekend, more than a foot of rain could fall in southern Greece.
This is about half of Finland's annual rainfall.
Severe Weather Europa has shared a video of the storm's development on its Facebook page.
Hurricane Zorbas has caused flooding in Tunisia and Libya earlier this week.
Do you recognize the love island duck that men drool over?
He appears in some confusing YouTube videos.
Few people know that in the Love Island Finland series, the beautiful Anku, who is drooling over several men, also appears in the odd Youtube videos published in 2010 as a carpet-weaving lady.
In videos, Anku gives advice to fishermen on how to make squid from an old roll of paper.
The duck also shows in a sympathetic way how to make a silk out of sockpants that will grow real spines.
Now we're going to make the weeds grow, but we're going to do it in a little bit of a surprising way, and Ank suggests and introduces a saw blade, sockpants and weed seeds, which he makes a silk.
You can watch the videos below or on Anku's YouTube channel here.
Walter Bottas is shaking and adrenaline-fuelled in Sotsh. Is he going to be Hamilton's assistant on Sunday?
Valtteri Bottas was still shaking a little for a few minutes after his pole position race at the Russian Grand Prix, when he was in front of the media.
The fine lap left behind Mercedes' number one Lewis Hamilton and was certainly a major criticism for the Finnish champion this season.
Have a good round.
I don't know what happened to Lewis when he left the decision round halfway through.
I feel good, I'm still shaking a little bit, Bottas made it.
I've only been to the pole once this year, in Austria (midsummer), so it's been a while.
This track has been good to me before, and I've had some good laps again.
The Sochi track is not easy to pass, so the start is particularly important.
And of course, Bottas got to answer the question of whether he would win tomorrow or whether he would be facing Hamilton, who is close to the world championship title.
My starting point for the race is definitely to try to win.
When you start from the pole, there can't be any other goal, Bottas said.
But as a stable, we're fighting for both championships.
Lewis' lead over Sebastian Vettel is pretty big, and the difference between me and him is very big, so I have to keep that in mind.
Let's see what happens, though. Bottas added.
Hamilton was genuinely happy after the race with Botts' success, and Mercedes team principal Toto Wolff was also happy to see him.
Lewis had the intention of beating Valtteri, but he failed in the seventh round.
Walter knows he's gonna have to give up everything to beat Lewis.
And he was so charged up, adrenaline was pouring out of his ears, Wolff was glowing.
When asked if the team would allow Botts and Hamilton to run honestly, Wolff responded with a dodge.
We'll talk about it in the morning, see how the race goes.
Erno Kinnunen from Kytele won the Finnish Rally Championship
The SM series of rally cars ended with a rare finish.
Hardly ever before have the brothers been Finnish champions at the same time.
This time, the final rally in Turku and the surrounding area of Salona was won by Eerik and Henrik Pietarinen from Tuusala, as Eerik won the SM1 and Henrik SM2 classes.
The Finnish champion Erno Kinnunen secured his career best result when he finished third in the final standings to win the Finnish championship in the SM4 class of two-wheel drive cars.
Kinnunen and Ville Mäkelä, who competed in the Honda Civic, started the Turku share race with a modest start, because the starting points were clear: placing in the top group would guarantee the SM title.
In the darkness of Friday night, the duo had to make up for a failure of some of the backup lights in another special test.
It was a pretty blind-sided third act.
It's not a good time to be a jerk.
On Saturday, only the second-placed Jussi Tepo was watched, Kinnunen said.
Syria is demanding that the United States, France and Turkey withdraw their troops.
The Syrian Foreign Ministry is calling on the United States, France and Turkey to withdraw their troops from Syria.
Speaking at the UN General Assembly on Saturday, Foreign Minister Walid Muallem says foreign troops must leave Syria immediately and without conditions.
Muallem said that foreign troops were in Syria to fight terrorism and that the war against terrorists was "nearly over".
In his speech to the UN, Muallem also appealed to Syrian refugees to return home.
But the war, which has been going on for seven years, shows no end in sight.
More than 360,000 people have died in the war.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel said on Friday in Germany that a meeting on Syria was planned for October, with the presidents of France, Russia and Turkey to attend in addition to her.
Not exactly the Super Bowl, but tens of millions of Americans watched the Supreme Court justice drama on television.
Supreme Court nominee Judge Brett Kavanaugh and the professor who accused him of harassment, Christine Blasey Ford, drew an unusually large crowd.
In the United States, the Supreme Court Justice's inauguration drama in full swing drew at least 20 million people to its television sets on Thursday.
At the time, Donald Trump's nominee, Kavanaugh, and the California professor who accused him of harassment, Blasey Ford, were testifying before the Senate Judiciary Committee.
The preliminary results showed that the hearings were watched by a total of 20.4 million viewers on the six main channels ABC, CBS, CNN, FOX News, MSNBC and NBC.
In addition to these, several million more people followed the online hearing.
NBC reported that 6.8 million people watched the live stream, and CNN reported that it broke its record for the year with 8.2 million live streams.
CNN's number rises to over 10 million when you add in YouTube and Facebook followers.
Fox News Digital also reached 8.0 million launches.
Digital launches are owned by the channels, and TV viewership figures are sourced from Nielsen, a research and data analytics company.
Nielsen is releasing the final numbers on Monday, but they're still pretty high.
Few of them reach 20 million .
With more than 20 million viewers in the United States, the average viewer is limited to sports events, the Oscars and Grammy Awards, and occasional political events, such as presidential speeches and, in 2016, presidential debates.
The most watched annual program in the United States, the NFL's Super Bowl finals, is certainly a long way off.
This year, the Super Bowl drew an estimated 103 million people to the screens for NBC.
Last year, Nielsen estimated that nearly 48 million people watched Trump's first speech to Congress, and just under 30 million watched the inauguration.
The most important thing
The Supreme Court appointment is a very important case in the United States because the judges are appointed for life.
Trump was able to name one new justice after Antonin Scalia died in early 2016 and the Republicans were able to prevent then-President Barack Obama from naming a successor.
The second job was opened when Justice Anthony Kennedy, 81, announced his retirement this year.
Kennedy was appointed by Republican President Ronald Reagan, but he was on many issues the so-called balance-sheet whose vote could decide the nine-member court.
She was a supporter of abortion rights and the rights of sexual minorities, and in 2015, for example, she voted to grant same-sex marriage rights throughout the entire federal government.
Kavanaugh is a far more conservative man.
His election to the Supreme Court could lock in the conservative arm of the court for decades.
Children have the right to information from their parents
Only parents of children under 10 years of age can see their children's health information on Kanta.
It's a big problem, it's wrong, and it's weird.
The situation with Kanta was, of course, even more worrying at the beginning: parents could not even see their babies' health records or prescriptions.
The situation was temporarily characterised by a correction in autumn 2016 for children under 10 years of age.
Since then, the practices have been promised to be corrected, but it has taken a surprising amount of time to correct them.
Now, the repair is scheduled for 2020.
The problem is clear, so the change in the legal basis should have been no more than a matter of cheering.
Then, in layman's terms, it's a matter of pushing a button: now that the winding is closed, it opens.
Of course, a child can show his parents his information if he has bank details or an official ID.
But how many 10-year-olds have?
The ID card is a charge, and the bank details are not even for a 10-year-old.
So basically, the information of a fourth grader in elementary school is not available to anyone except to ask for it printed.
It's not so much about the rights of the parents as it is about the rights of the children.
It is vital that parents be involved in the care of a child.
The right to privacy of adolescents must, of course, be respected.
Even minors may have family situations where not everything is openly discussed.
Often they are related to sexual health, which is a deeply meaningful human right to be free to care for.
In the United States, the FBI has begun dropping harassment charges against Kavanaugh.
According to US media reports, the FBI is investigating at least two women's allegations of sexual harassment.
One of the women was heard earlier this week by the Senate Judiciary Committee.
Kavanaugh has denied the allegations of sexual harassment during his time at the university.
President Donald Trump has ordered the FBI to investigate the allegations at the request of the Senate Judiciary Committee.
We can't wait more than a week to get this thing out.
According to the Washington Post, this is a more limited investigation than a criminal investigation, and it may not be made public.
A man threatened to kill police officers at a police station in Kajaani.
The arrested mobster continued to bully the cameras.
Police say they've put the man in police custody to "calm down".
Police were threatened by a suspected assailant in Kajaani on the night before Saturday.
Authorities are reporting a case that began when a 30-year-old man got into a heated argument in a downtown restaurant.
The first time he assaulted another customer inside the grocery store.
This led to his removal from the restaurant.
Outside, a fighter attacked another man by knocking him to the ground.
When the third party tried to intervene, he hit her, too.
The triple-assed assault led to the police being called.
Patrol caught the man and took Kajan to the police station, police say.
The suspect continued to behave aggressively at the police station.
A man kicked another cop in the leg.
He threatened to kill and beat up the cops.
Police say they've taken the man to the police station to "calm down".
The man is charged with three counts of assault and one count of aggravated resistance to duty.
Aid agencies prepare to start work in Sulawesi, Indonesia - "Clean water is the most urgent need"
The United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) and other international aid agencies are ready to help in Sulawesi, Indonesia, says Kirsi Haru, UNICEF's Finnish director of information.
Local authorities are leading the rescue effort, but the need for additional assistance is already evident at this stage.
UNICEF works in almost every country, and we have long-term programs in Indonesia.
In addition to normal operations, UNICEF is always fully prepared for emergencies, Haru says.
The first task now is to find people from the rubble, both survivors and the dead.
Rescue operations are underway in the town of Palun in Sulawesi, but the situation in the Donggala area a little further north is more uncertain.
There are still places where the comms don't work.
Relief efforts are difficult because roads are also cut off, says Haru.
Buildings in Sulawesi are often of light construction, so the damage from earthquakes and tsunamis is heavy.
Once survivors are found, they need shelter, first tents, then clean water.
Clean water is the most urgent thing in a crisis.
First, people are often able to get water-purifying tablets, which UNICEF has in stock.
The water systems are repaired as soon as possible, but in case of emergency, the water is first transported by trucks.
In times of crisis, many children are separated from their parents.
The search for family members and family reunification is part of UNICEF's mission.
Food aid is provided by the World Food Programme (WFP), a United Nations agency.
Initially, the emergency aid will be funded from previously raised funds.
However, UNICEF, among others, has already begun a fundraiser to help victims of the Indonesian earthquake and tsunami.
Billionaire Elon Musk is stepping down as Tesla's chairman of the board after fining him $20 million for tweeting
Elon Musk, founder of the company that makes rocket ships and electric cars, is avoiding fraud charges by agreeing to a deal with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
Billionaire Elon Musk is stepping down as chairman of the board of electric car company Tesla and agreeing to a $20 million fine.
Musk is stepping down as part of an agreement he made with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
By agreeing to the deal, Musk can avoid fraud charges.
The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) threatened Musk with securities fraud over a series of tweets he posted in August.
In it, Musk wrote that he was preparing to delist Tesla, the electric car company, which caused the company's stock price to rise rapidly.
Under the terms of the agreement, Musk will not serve as Tesla's chairman of the board for three years.
In addition, Tesla must appoint a new "independent member" to its board and add two "independent directors" to its board.
Tesla also has to set up a committee to oversee Musk's communications.
Musk will still be allowed to remain CEO of Tesla.
In addition to Musk's $20 million personal fines, Tesla will also have to pay $20 million in equivalent fines to the CFO.
The tweets were misleading investors.
The SEC said Musk's tweets misled investors and Tesla shareholders.
Musk claimed that he had secured the financing to buy Tesla back from the stock market as a private equity company.
According to a billionaire's tweets, the company would have been taken off the stock market at $420 a share.
Tesla's stock price rose more than 10% in the 24 hours after the tweets, but then fell.
The SEC has determined that Musk's claims were without merit.
The supervisor claimed that he had not actually negotiated the funding he claimed.
He also had not discussed the IPO with the rest of the management team or the board of directors.
On Friday this week, the stock fell 14 percent after the SEC filed a fraud complaint.
The new agreement is expected to re-establish the company's position.
The final verdict is not a reason.
Of course, the bells of the cathedral do not ring when the hands do not move.
It's a technical glitch.
The clock in the tower of the Helsinki Cathedral has stopped.
The time is now midnight.
It's like a typical horror movie, even with the sound of a haunting in the crypt and the bells ringing.
Of course not, but the clock has stopped for a technical reason: it is broken.
The repairman has been to look at it, but some part has broken and a new part is waiting for it, says the sundiver Eveliina Jamesen.
At the same time, Jamesen confirms the point already mentioned by the Church in Helsinki Twitter account.
The account says that the final judgment is not a reason for the clock to stop.
James says the church bells don't ring because of a fault.
