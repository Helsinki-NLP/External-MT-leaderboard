Candidates can send representatives to serve as witnesses at any stage of the process. In the evening, the votes are counted by volunteers under close supervision, according to specific procedures.

below are medium-sized cats who eat medium-sized prey ranging from rabbits to antelopes to deer.
Finally, there are many small cats (including free-ranging pet cats) that eat the smaller animals that are much larger in number, such as insects, reptiles, bats and birds.
The secret to their success is the concept of niche, a special role that each cat plays that keeps it from competing with others.
Lions are the most social cats, they live in large groups called herds.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
Females are usually very close to each other, being a large family of sisters and daughters.
Lion troops behave very similarly to wolf or dog troops, animals that behave surprisingly similarly to lions (but not to other big cats), and are especially lethal to their prey.
Being particularly athletic, the tiger can climb (though not very well), swim, jump great distances and pull with five times the strength of a strong person.
The tiger is in the same group as the lions, tigers and jaguars. These four cats are the only ones that can roar.
The tiger's howling is not like the lion's powerful rattle, it's more like a sentence of words shouted with impatience.
e they can, they'll catch monkeys, snakes, reptiles and birds. Almost all the animals that the eucalyptos hunt are much smaller than them.
scientists think that ocelots find animals to eat and follow them by scent, by the smell of the soil they're passing through.
They can see well in the dark using night vision, and also sneak in the silence. Ocults hunt their prey by blending with the environment and then leaping on the prey.
When a small group of animals (a small population) separates from the main population from which they came (such as if they cross a mountain range or a river, or if they move to a new island so they cannot easily return) they will often find themselves in a different environment than they were in before.
In this new environment, there are different resources and different competitors, so the new population will need different characteristics or adaptations than they previously required to be a strong competitor.
The original population hasn't changed at all, they still need the same adaptations as before.
n ae n ae time, as a new population starts to adjust to their new surroundings, they start to look less and less like the other population.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will look so different from each other, that they won't be seen as the same species.
This process we call speciation, which means the creation of new species. Speciation is an inevitable outcome and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce oxygen that humans breathe, and they absorb carbon dioxide that humans exhale.

We don't know for sure, but he may have had a half-tongue. His diet included turtles, big fish, other muses, and he may have even been a cannibal.
Plus, it attacked any creature that went into the water; even a giant dinosaur like the T-Rex couldn't stand up to it.
While most of their food was familiar to us, the Romans did have some strange or unusual items for celebration, including wild boar, peacock, snails and a type of reptile called namamen.
Another difference was that whereas poor men and women ate their food sitting on chairs, the rich men liked to have dinners where they would sit on their sides while they ate their meal.
It's impossible that ancient Roman cuisine included foods that arrived in Europe from America or Asia centuries later.

Sometimes special pyramidal towers were built, called ziggurats, as part of the temples.
The top of the tower was a special shrine to the god.
In the hot climate of the Middle East, home didn't matter so much.
The majority of the Hebrew family's life was spent outdoors.
Women cooked in the yard; shops were just open counters facing the street.
The land of Canaan had few forests, so timber was very expensive.
Greenland was inhabited by giants. Norse sagas tell that Erik the Red was banished from Iceland for murder, and in his travels west he discovered Greenland and gave it the name Greenland.

The landings on the day of the Normandy invasion and the battles that followed liberated northern France, but the south was still not free.
It was ruled by the French of Vichy, who were Frenchmen who collaborated with the Germans in 1940 and sided with the invaders rather than fighting them.
"n 15th August 1940, the Allies invaded southern France, the invasion was called Operation Dragon".
within just two weeks the Americans and the Free French forces had liberated southern France and were heading towards Germany.
Civilization is a unique culture shared by a particularly large group of people who live and work together, as a society.
Civilization comes from the Latin word chibilis, meaning citizen, related to the Latin word chibis, meaning citizen, and chibitas, meaning city or city-state, which also defines in some way the size of society.
Civilization implies knowledge transfer between several generations, cultural footprint and relatively large distribution.
Minority cultures often disappear without leaving any relevant historical evidence and are not recognized as true civilizations.

Congressional power was no taxation and since there was no executive or judicial power, he relied on the authorities in the states, who were often uncooperative, to enforce his laws.
And it had no authority to circumvent the tax laws and tariffs between states.
The statute must be unanimously agreed upon by all states before an amendment could be added, and states treated the central government so lightly that their representatives were mostly absent.

In 1624, the Dutch East India Company establishes a base in southwest Taiwan, which causes a change in traditional grain growing practices and the employment of Chinese workers in its rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, Qing Dynasty forces (1912-1644) seized the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, following defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Shimonoseki Agreement, which ceded sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.

"For example, the world's most popular still camera format is 35mm, which was the dominant film size at the end of the analogue film era".
still in production today, but more importantly, its height-to-width ratio has been inherited to image formats in a digital camera.
"The dimensions of the 35mm format are actually, somewhat confusingly, 36mm wide and 24mm high".
So the width-to-height ratio of this format (twelve-digits to get the simplest integer ratio) should be 3:2.

The Law of Thirds, which has absorbed cycles of ridicule and abuse, is the simple guideline for creating dynamics while maintaining a measure of order in the picture.
He states that the most effective place for the central subject of a photograph is at the intersection of the lines that divide the image into three vertically and horizontally (see example).
During this period in European history, the Catholic Church, which had become rich and powerful, was subject to severe criticism.

Her penetrating power affected everyone, from the king to the common man.
One of the core beliefs in Christianity is that capital should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty and that church money is specifically intended for this purpose.
The central authority of the church in Rome for over a thousand years, and this concentration of power and money has led many to question whether this principle has been preserved.

The strategy proved to be effective, blocking vital military and civilian supplies, although this siege violated accepted international rules signed in a number of international agreements over the past two centuries.

"Mohammed was deeply interested in matters beyond this physical life. He often commanded a cave known as Ka'ira on Mount Nur (light) to immerse himself in profound observation".
The cave itself, which has survived throughout history, provides a rich picture of Muhammad's spiritual inclinations.
The cave is located on top of a mountain north of Mecca and is completely isolated from the rest of the world.

The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders of the World that still exists today.
The Great Pyramid, built by the Egyptians in the 3rd century BC, is one of many large pyramidal structures built to honor deceased pharaohs.
"The Giza Plain, or Giza Necropolis in the Valley of the Dead in Egypt contains several pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the largest), several small tombs, several temples and the Great Sphinx".
The Great Pyramid was built in honor of Pharaoh Khufu, and many of the smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built in honor of his wives and the members of Khufu's family.
"The up-arc sign looks like a V and the down-arc sign like a pin pin or a square without its lower rib".
Up means you have to start at the end and push the bow, and down means you have to start at the end (in place of the hand holding the bow) and pull the bow.
A higher bow generally produces a softer sound, whereas a lower bow is more powerful and assertive.

To understand the Templars, you have to understand the context that led to the establishment of the Order.
The period in which these events occurred is known as the High Middle Ages, a period in European history that lasted through the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000-1300 C.E.).
The height of the Middle Ages was preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which is generally accepted to have ended around 1500.
TECHNOLOGICAL DETERMINISM is a term that encompasses a wide range of ideas and practices, ranging from push technology or technological dictation to a growing sense that human destiny is based on logic that rises above natural law and their expression in technology.
"Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general ideas: that technological development proceeds in a way that is not influenced culturally or politically to a large extent, and that technology has effects on societies that are constructed, not social conditioned".

However, a nationwide road network is not economically viable for a handful of cars, so new production methods are being developed in order to lower the cost of owning cars.

The Romantic movement included a large element of cultural determinism, inspired by writers such as Goethe, Pietta and Schuegel.
In the context of the Romantic movement, geography shaped people, and over time customs and cultures associated with this geography emerged, and these, due to their harmony with the status of society, were preferred over the rules imposed by the rituals.

Sustainable agriculture is a simple, often organic, method that uses preserved seeds from the ecoregion in combination with crop rotation or other methods that are relatively simple to maximize reproduction.
Throughout history, most farmers have been engaged in farming for self-sustainability and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Subculture brings together people with similar beliefs who feel left out by social standards, allowing them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures can be unique because of the age, ethnicity, class, location and/or gender of the members.
The features that define a subculture as distinct are linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographic, or a combination of factors.

one of the most common ways to feel the importance of socialization is to learn from the unfortunate isolated cases of children who, because of neglect, misfortune or deliberate abuse, did not experience socialization by adults as they grew up.
"Such children are called wild children. Some wild children were imprisoned by people (usually their parents); in some cases, the abandonment of the child occurred due to the parents' refusal to accept the child's severe mental or physical disability".
Wild children may have experienced severe abuse or trauma before they were abandoned or fled.
Others, it is claimed, were raised by animals; some were said to live in the wild alone.
When raised by non-human animals, the wild child exhibits behaviors (under physical limitations) almost completely identical to those of the animal that has been raised with it, such as fear or indifference towards humans.
Though project-based learning is supposed to make learning easier and more interesting, the bug method goes one step further.
Pigami is not a learning method but a learning aid that supports people going through a new learning experience such as using a new computer software or starting a new project.
Pygmas can be virtual or real, in other words, teachers are a form of pygma but also the little paper clicker in Microsoft Office.
Virtual Pygmies are embedded in the software and are designed to ask, respond to and explain challenging processes that students may have difficulty dealing with on their own.
children are sent to foster homes for a variety of reasons, ranging from neglect to abuse to even blackmail.
No child in the world deserves to grow up in an environment that is not nurturing, caring and educational, and they grow up like that.
We view the foster care system as a safe zone for these children.
Our foster care system is designed to provide safe homes, loving caregivers, stable education and reliable health care.
adoption care should provide for all the needs that were missing in the home from which they were taken in the past.
Internet combines elements of mass communication and interpersonal communication.
The unique characteristics of the Internet lead to additional dimensions in terms of usability and access to content.
"For example, it has been argued that learning and socializing are important motivators for Internet use" (James et al., 1995).
"Personal engagement and enduring relationships were also identified as new motivational aspects by Amy and Corrod (1998) when they studied audience responses to Internet sites".
The use of video has led to important discoveries in the interpretation of micro-expressions, which are facial movements that last for several milliseconds.

Oliver Sacks, in his article The President's Speech, noted how people who cannot understand speech because of brain damage are still able to accurately judge honesty.
He even suggested that such abilities in analyzing human behavior are also shared with animals like domestic dogs.
20th century studies have shown that there are two reservoirs of genetic variation: hidden and manifest.
mutation adds a new genetic variation, and selection erases it from the pool of expressed variation.
Segregation and re-combination mix the differences back and forth between the two deposits with each generation.
In the savanna, it is difficult for a primate with a digestive system similar to that of humans to meet its amino acid requirements from available plant sources.
n't do this, there are serious consequences: stunting, malnutrition, and eventually death.
The most readily available plant resources were the available proteins in small quantities, but for primates like us, they're hard to digest unless they're cooked.
On the other hand, animal foods (ants, termites, eggs) are not only easy to digest, but also provide a large amount of protein containing all the essential amino acids.
"Given all the data, we shouldn't be surprised if our ancestors solved their protein problem in about the same ways that chimpanzees use in the savannah today".
Sleep apnea is a process of deliberate waking during your normal sleep time and falling asleep shortly thereafter (10-60 minutes).
You can do this easily with a relatively quiet alarm clock that will bring you back to consciousness without waking you up completely.

Other possibilities based on urethritis involve drinking lots of fluids (especially water or tea, from known urine) before bed, forcing the former to get up to urinate.
The amount of inner peace a person has is inversely proportional to the amount of tension in a person's body and mind.
The lower the tension, the more positive the life force that exists. Each person has the ability to achieve absolute peace and contentment.
The only thing that separates him from our goals is our tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but this was expanded by the love path of Mahayana and by many techniques from Indian Yoga.
Tibetan Buddhism is very simple.It includes the Kundalini of yoga, meditation and all-embracing love.

On 17 September 1939, the Polish defenses had been broken, and the only chance was to retreat and reorganize along the Romanian bridgehead.
However, these plans became irrelevant almost overnight, as over 800,000 soldiers from the Soviet Red Army entered and formed the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts after invading eastern regions of Poland in violation of the Riga Accord, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact and other international, bilateral and multilateral agreements.
The use of ships to transport goods is the most efficient way at great distances to move large quantities of people and goods across the oceans.
The role of the Marine Corps has traditionally been to ensure that your country can keep your people and products moving, while at the same time disrupting the enemy's ability to move their people and products.

Early cultures and tribes began keeping them for convenient access to milk, fur, meat and leather.
Domesticated goats were usually kept in herds that roamed hillsides or other grazing areas, often tended by shepherds who were often children or teenagers, similar to the better-known shepherd. These herding methods are still in use today.
Carriageways were built in England as early as the 16th century.
Though the wagon tracks were only parallel wooden structures, they allowed the horses to pull them to higher speeds and carry larger loads than on the slightly rougher roads of the time.

It became the norm, but the iron further rubbed the wooden wheels of the carts.
In 1767, the first rails made entirely of iron were introduced.
The earliest known form of mobility was walking, humans began walking upright two million years ago with the appearance of Homo erectus.
their predecessors, the Australopithecus, did not walk upright as often as they did.
walking was found in the fossils of Australopithecus from 3.9 to 4.2 million years ago, although the sahlenanthropus may have walked on two legs as early as 7 million years ago.

In many cases, this is just like symptomatic treatment. However, if we don't want a temporary solution, we need to find the root of the problem and we need to neutralize it.

After being approved by Congress on July 4, a handwritten draft signed by President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thompson was sent to John Dunlap's printing house, a few blocks away.
"Overnight, 150 to 200 copies were produced, now called Dunlop sheets".
The first public reading of the document was made by John Nixon in the courtyard of Independence Hall on July 8.
one was sent to George Washington on July 6, who called it to his troops in New York on July 9. a copy arrived in London on August 10.
The 25 Dunlop scrolls that are known to still exist are the oldest surviving copies of the document.

The internal toxicity may not be immediately apparent. Symptoms such as vomiting are so general that immediate diagnosis is not possible.
The best indication for internal poisoning might be the presence of an open medicine box or or open bottles of household chemicals.
You should check the label for first aid instructions specific to this poison.
Entomologists use the term bug in a formal sense to refer to this group of insects.
The term comes from the ancient acquaintance with bed bugs, which are insects that have largely adapted to parasitic relationships with humans.
both torpedo and bed bugs are nesting midges who have adapted to living in a nest or a host's house.

Aristóteles was accepted in all sciences, including psychology.
As Greek knowledge declined, the West found itself cut off from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
n observance of rhythms in physiology and behavior, which often depend critically on the presence of internal cycles, and their formation by biological clocks.
Cyclical patterns, which are not just reactions to external periodic signals, are documented in most living things, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that will continue for a period of time in constant cycles even in the absence of external signals.
The Hersh and Chase experiment was one of the first claims that DNA is genetic material.
Hershy and Chase used PGs, or viruses, to implant their own DNA into a bacterium.
They did two experiments where we tagged the DNA in Pag with radioactive mercury or the Pag protein with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have a variety of different effects depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the affected piece of genetic material and whether the affected cells are offspring cells of the germ layer.
Only mutations in the germ line can pass to children, whereas mutations elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism attracts people who want to visit natural areas to enjoy the scenery, including the plants and wildlife.

iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii
Everyone participates in society and uses transportation systems. Almost everyone complains about transportation systems.

Why do transportation systems get so much complaint, why do they fail on a daily basis? Are simple transportation engineers untalented? Or is something more substantial happening there?
Traffic flow is the field of study that studies the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions between them.
Unfortunately, learning traffic flow is difficult because you can't predict driver behavior with 100% accuracy.
Fortunately, drivers' behaviour tends to stay within the range of logical consistency; therefore, traffic flow generally has logical consistency and can be roughly represented mathematically.
To better represent traffic flow, we've constructed relationships between the three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These links help with the planning, design and operation of roads.
Insects were the first animals to take to the air. Their ability to fly helped them to evade enemies more easily and find food and mates more efficiently.
Most insects enjoy the advantage of being able to fold their wings back along their body.
Then they have a wider range of small places where they can hide like crazy.
Today, the only insects that can't fold their wings are spiders and spider mites.

Content theories are all about finding the same thing that motivates people or charms them.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that they fulfill as they grow older.
These theories examine what is in certain people that makes them want the things they do and what things in their environment will make them do or not do certain things.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs and Herzberg's two-factor theory.
"Generally speaking, two behaviors can break out when people become the bosses of their former colleagues.

At the other end of the spectrum, the individual becomes unrecognizable and feels that he or she must change everything the team has done and make it their own.
After all, the leader is ultimately responsible for the success and failure of the team.
This behavior often ends in rifts between the leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams are required to the same professional standards as regular teams, but there are slight differences.
Virtual team members often act as liaisons with their immediate physical group.
They often have greater autonomy than conventional staff members, as their teams may meet in different time zones, which may not be understandable to their local management.
"The presence of a real invisible team (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p109) is also a unique component of a virtual team".
"The Invisible Team is the management team to which all team members are subordinated. The Invisible Team sets the standards for each team member".
Why would an organization want to go through the time-consuming process of setting up a learning organization? One goal for implementing organizational learning concepts is innovation.
When all the resources available in all the functional departments of an organization are used efficiently, creativity and resilience can occur.
As a result, a process of an organization working together to overcome a barrier can lead to a new innovative process that will serve the customer's need.
Before an organisation can innovate, leadership must create a culture of innovation and also shared knowledge and organisational learning.
Angel (2006) explains the sequential approach as a method used to help organizations achieve a higher level of performance.
Neurobiological data provides physical evidence for a theoretical approach to cognition research, so it narrows down the field of study and makes it more precise.
The link between brain pathology and behavior support scientists in their research.
It's long been known that different types of brain damage, trauma, injury and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in certain mental functions.
The emergence of new technologies allows us to see and study structures and processes in the brain that have never been seen before.
This provides us with much information and material needed to build blood models, which help us understand processes in our consciousness.
Although AI has a strong science fiction connotation, it is a very important branch of computer science, dealing with the behavior, learning, and intellectual adaptation of machines.
