Parliament does not support the amendment that frees Tymoshenko
Today, the Ukrainian Parliament, in the course of amendments to the Criminal Procedure Code, rejected an attempt to abolish the article that condemned the leader of the opposition, Yulia Tymoshenko.
An amendment that would have freed the jailed former prime minister was rejected during the second reading of a bill to mitigate sentences for economic offenses.
In October, Tymoshenko was sentenced to seven years in prison for signing a gas deal with Russia that was deemed unprofitable.
The verdict is not yet final; the court will hear Tymoshenko's appeal in December.
Tymoshenko argues that the sentence is a political revenge of the regime; in the West, the process was also suspected of bias.
The proposal to abolish Article 365 of the Criminal Procedure Code, under which the former prime minister was convicted, was supported by 147 members of Parliament.
It would take 226 votes to ratify.
The victory of Libya
In the history of liberation, or rebellion, Libya has already had losers.
Muammar Gaddafi is buried in the desert somewhere.
It's time to determine the winners.
Islamists usually win in a country; the question is whether they are moderate or radical.
The transitional government has declared itself a follower of the common law of Sharia, which we have already heard of.
Libya will be a crime-free country, because the punishment for stealing is the amputation of a hand.
Women can forget about emancipation; potential apostates will be executed; and so on.
Instead of a dictator, a society of rival clans will be united by the Koran.
There will be an order in Libya that we cannot imagine, and that we hardly wish for.
In any case, our way of life is neither unique nor the best, and it probably wouldn't be appropriate for, say, the people of Libya.
In fact, it's surprising that Islamic militants have accepted help from non-believers.
Their only excuse is that they believe the NATO airstrikes were not led by an American general, but by Allah, whose greatness they praised after each strike.
And if you're looking for winners in Libya, the West isn't one of them.
We were in gunfights, serving Islam, and our politicians got rid of the dictator, their political ally, with no guarantees of profit.
Given the recent sad experiences with Afghanistan and Iraq, we have decided to abandon the military occupation of Libya.
The local population, therefore, does not have to worry about the expulsion of the Crusaders.
But without the occupation, will the oil companies get Libya's black gold for almost nothing?
And then the West can finally boast about its selfless defense of civil rights.
Unless the followers of the Sharia put an end to it.
A new wave of crisis is beginning
France and the rest of Europe are now in the spotlight.
A statistical storm swept across Europe on Tuesday.
Some countries have released their third-quarter GDP figures.
Compared to the previous quarter, the Czech economy was in a state of stagnation, with Germany and France showing growth.
And yet the debt market is at record highs today.
Investors are not only looking to Italy; they are now focusing on Spain, France, Austria and other countries.
The statistical offices of the Eurozone countries in Germany, the Czech Republic and some other countries have released their preliminary estimates of economic development in the third quarter.
Germany's GDP grew by the expected 0.5%; France's - by 0.4%.
Both countries also adjusted for the second quarter, in which Germany did better than expected (growth of 0.3% instead of the original 0.1%), France reported a slight decline of 0.1% (initial information suggested stagnation).
In the third quarter of this year, the Czech economy showed a preliminary growth of 1.5%.
However, GDP was stagnant compared to the previous quarter, according to the Czech Statistical Bureau, confirming the trend of gradual slowdown in economic growth.
The results were worse than analysts had predicted.
Key events:
In the third quarter of this year, the Czech economy showed a preliminary growth of 1.5%; however, it was in a state of stagnation compared to the previous quarter.
Based on preliminary and seasonal data, the German economy grew by 0.5% in the third quarter.
From July to September, the economies of both the Eurozone and the European Union grew by 0.2% compared to the previous quarter, which is consistent with analysts' forecasts.
Greece's economy showed a preliminary decline of 5.2%.
The yield on its 10-year bonds is 28.45%.
The yields of both Italian and Spanish bonds are approaching the critical point.
Even Austria, the Netherlands, France and Belgium, etc., are starting to have difficulties.
Despite the deterioration of the situation in the region, the yield on Czech 1-year bonds remains around 4%.
In Germany, they say that the ECB is the last creditor that can save the situation.
The Czech national team has qualified for the EURO.
In Montenegro, they won 1-0 and are celebrating a surprise cash prize of 200 million.
The national team has successfully completed the most difficult challenge of the season!
Thanks to the great Czech and the beautiful goal of Peter Iracek, they won with a score of 1:0.
In the second half, the Czech team was fortunate to keep a significant advantage after the home replay, and it will again take part in the European Championship.
IHNED.cz has been monitoring the match and has compiled a detailed report.
Almost nothing in the first half and a lot of luck in the second.
The Czech national team, partly because of the team's defeat at the end; the great Czech; and the heroic Yiracek; won 1:0 in Montenegro and are celebrating their entry into the European Championship.
The Czech team's excellent defense allowed the Montenegrin team to create dangerous moments only in the second half of the game.
Damianovic and Vuchinic were the most unsuccessful pair of the match after missing two great opportunities.
The great Peter Chek is one of the reasons why the Czech national team will not miss the European Championship next year, and Czech football will thus earn about 200 million Czech crowns.
From the first minute, the game was very tense.
Both teams had difficulty with the combinations; the game was mostly center field.
This also explains the lack of pressure from the home team in the first half.
Iranian students are willing to die for their country's nuclear program.
They've created a live shield.
Several hundred university students have created a living shield around a nuclear power plant in Iran.
They want to show their support for their country's nuclear program in the face of a possible Israeli attack.
On Tuesday afternoon, students prayed before entering the building, followed by a prayer for the destruction of both the United States and Israel.
In Isfahan, Iran, several hundred university students have created a living shield around the Isfahan uranium enrichment plant.
They thus demonstrated their willingness to protect their country's nuclear program at the cost of their own lives.
In its latest report, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said that there is evidence that Iran has not given up its nuclear weapons.
A possible attack on nuclear facilities in Iran was discussed in Israel.
On Tuesday afternoon, students prayed before entering the Isfahan uranium enrichment plant, followed by a prayer for the destruction of both the United States and Israel.
In the event of an attack aimed at paralyzing Iran's nuclear program to the maximum, the targets would be, according to the Israeli press, the facilities at both Isfahan and Natanz, where uranium enrichment is carried out.
Nutrition for children suffering from obesity: No breakfast and no sausage for dinner
More than a third of children between the ages of 9 and 13 are overweight; while 9% of schoolchildren are overweight, 5% are obese.
According to a recent study, children who are obese usually come from families that lead unhealthy lifestyles.
We see again the importance of the environment and the patterns of behavior that accompany a person for his or her healthy development.
For example, sausage is nearly twice as likely to be served at the tables of obese children as it is in families with normal-weight children.
More than 19 percent of children with obesity ate fries at dinner the day before the survey, which is part of an educational event called Obesity - This is not a coincidence.
Moreover, families of children with obesity do not exercise, but this is true of most families of modern schoolchildren - only 15 percent of children said that their parents do exercise at least once a week.
The study was conducted on 900 children.
The study was conducted at the end of last school year; it involved nearly 900 elementary school students throughout Bohemia.
The event is held for the second year in a row, with the support of the insurance company Všeobecná zdravotní pojišťovna and the company Unilever.
To date, more than 12 thousand students have joined the project.
Proper nutrition and adequate exercise are the main determinants of the rapidly increasing number of children who are overweight or obese.
"For example, only half of those surveyed said that they ate five meals a day, breakfast-snack-lunch-snack-dinner, which is a requirement of a healthy diet", says one study.
No lunch and sausage in the evenings .
Experts warn that even such relative details as the regular family breakfast time are important for healthy development.
In the Czech Republic, only 23% of school families have breakfast together.
In most families, everyone has a separate breakfast.
The worst discovery was that one in ten families don't eat breakfast at all.
And yet breakfast is the basis of a proper daily diet.
A study found that fried foods were more commonly consumed in families with children who were obese.
Almost everyone - regardless of weight - drinks sugary soft drinks every day (70%).
Although more than 40 percent of children exercise regularly, that number more than doubles to 15 percent when it comes to their parents.
Make your own menu.
In another part of the study, the selected children (204 boys and 172 girls from 13 schools) were asked to make their own menu based on the foods offered and based on their tastes and preferences.
"The food preferences of Czech children aged 12-15 are far from ideal when it comes to healthy eating".
Their favorite foods include a large variety of flour, meat, and sweet dishes.
"The growing popularity of soft drinks is particularly alarming", says the study's conclusion.
As the main meal, pasta beat the bird by a small margin.
However, the children showed little interest in beans, fish and vegetable dishes.
The Pursuit of a Healthy Lifestyle
The study also found that children are willing to change their eating habits if they are given the right information.
"Many of the control group participants demonstrated a significant shift in preference toward healthy eating when they completed the questionnaire after the lecture. Obesity is not a coincidence", the project concludes.
This was particularly noticeable, for example, in the case of sugary soft drinks, where more children were preferring water.
In addition, the children were more likely to eat poultry and fish as a main dish, limiting the number of sweets and pastries.
A stylist must also be a good psychologist, say professionals
In the first article on stylist training, I lamented the amount of information in the introductory class.
I had no idea what was going to happen next.
Lectures from three experts in the field; advice on how to dress for unconventional figures; and a seminar on how all of this works in real life.
More to come.
The closer we get to the final exam, the more information and practical assignments await us.
The training is every Saturday and Sunday, but it's really packed with information.
This time, with Alenka, the director, (there are no men in the class), we discussed how to dress a woman whose body is not perfectly symmetrical.
Most women are not completely symmetrical.
One has a short neck, another has a boyish figure without proper forms, another weighs more than normal.
The stylist should know how to visually reduce the broad shoulders, lengthen the neck, or add missing volumes.
We were given advice on how to make women like Jennifer Lopez look bigger, with bigger breasts and thighs and a narrower waist, and not dress them too provocatively.
For example, if the waist and thigh gap is so large that you can't find a skirt or pants, you should have at least one custom-made item.
You will certainly not regret the money you have invested, for clothes that fit perfectly are priceless.
You'll feel much better in a custom-made skirt than one that's always moving, rolling, exposing the waist, etc.
The owners of boyish figures, on the other hand, may wear clothes with a row, an applique, a stitch or folds.
Given the abundance of information and the types of figures, I'm glad I have a whole week to figure it all out.
Still, I'm afraid that's a lot, considering the homework we've been given.
Each participant in the course had to come up with two outfits for a celebrity: one for the day and one for the evening.
We have to take into account their modern appearance, their style of dress and the type of figure.
I'm going to dress Miranda Kerr, who you may know from Victoria's Secret advertising campaigns.
I'm happy with myself because her outfit is so much simpler than, say, Britney Spears, or Christina Aguilera, who recently gained a ton of weight (please bear in mind that I'm exaggerating), or a very young Selena Gomez.
We have to cut clothes out of magazines or find them on the Internet, print them out and process them with graphics software.
The mudboard -- that's what we call the result -- then reflects our own style and attitude to the graphic image.
It's important to keep the graphic style component in mind.
The stylist doesn't just dress real people, but creates product pages in magazines (based on specific guidelines, such as fashionable bags, coats, etc.).
That's what the stylist and designer Mario Kamenick was telling us.
But it was only Sunday.
A stylist needs general knowledge
The Saturday lecture, which was filled with information about the types of figures, was animated by three guests who are experts in this field.
The stylist is Honza Pokorny; the fashion designer is Jacob Polanka; and the fashion photographer is Ben Rench.
Jacob reminded us that fashion is an illusion and a stylist should use that fact.
A good stylist can use one item of clothing in different ways.
In this case, diversity is the key to success.
For example, a trench coat can be worn normally, over jeans and T-shirts, like a coat; but it can also be worn on the naked body, without the laces, like a dress.
Another option is to roll up the sleeves or lift the collar, and the whole image changes completely.
"Play with it", he insisted.
However, the advice I appreciated most was this: "For your work, you must know the rules perfectly".
Then you can start breaking them,' Jacob told us.
And I finally understand why we're so obsessed with definitions and rules, what to combine with what and why, when in fashion magazines we often see something completely different.
Not to mention the fashion shows.
I learned from Ben, the photographer, that a stylist should have more options for outfits than he has to take photos.
So for a ten-page fashion review (equivalent to ten outfits), I have to be prepared to create at least fifteen images.
Now I also know that in a picture, an item of clothing often looks and works in combination with others in a way that is not the same as it does in reality.
We have to keep that in mind when we create an image.
Honza Pokorny confirmed that often image and style are half the battle.
Just look at Madonna, who doesn't have a great vocal, but her image and marketing have made her a global star.
Attitudes toward stylists in the Czech Republic are still quite cool.
Even famous people often find it superfluous (and believe that it is enough to be an expert in something, and how they look is secondary).
And if someone finally lets us create their style, we should expect them to tell us a different (smaller) size than the one they're actually wearing.
Then we go to Google and find out if the tabloids have written anything about a celebrity getting fat, losing weight, etc.
On Sunday, Honza and Mario emphasized that it's not enough for a stylist to know fashion and be able to pick out an outfit.
Our job is basically to interact with the people we dress; so it's important to be a good psychologist.
To be able to judge people, not to favor them, and to stick to your opinion.
"If a manager asks you to look at her clothes and add a few pretty things, you can't throw out her entire wardrobe and tell her that her clothes are awful".
"Find at least a few things you can commend, and suggest what you can wear with them", says Mario.
He also showed us what the work bag should specifically fit.
It's a bag that you tie around your waist to carry everything you need.
In addition to obvious items such as scissors, sticky roller or English pins, it should have a nylon thread (stylists use it when shooting some items, such as bags or hats), special clips to attach fabric to the back in case the clothes are too large (shoes and similar items are prohibited, as they spoil the clothes) or a sewing kit.
To distract from the lectures and gain some practical experience, we learned how to make the right shoe soles.
Even when shooting in a studio with a smooth floor, the soles can get damaged - not to mention shooting in the street.
So we started the patch.
You shouldn't touch shoes with scissors, so you don't spoil them.
It takes real skill.
I was glad Mario praised my work.
I didn't like the skills I mentioned.
That's just part of what we heard during the second part of the weekend course.
I'm starting to realize that being a professional stylist isn't easy, no matter what they say.
V Need for Speed: Running is set in America.
The review
What should have been a carefree walk turned into a routine morning commute to work because of a series of completely inappropriate and careless mistakes.
The ambitions were met to some extent, but it didn't matter, because nobody clearly wanted to do the extra work.
Before the release of the new version with the subtitle "Run" there were high hopes.
It was expected to move the previous Need For Speed series in a new direction; demo versions indicated that the game would take its rightful place in the racing game genre.
We were curious to see the parts of the game where the main character gets out of the car and runs.
As is often the case with NFS, the results are very different from what we expected.
The game is a pretty good arcade game, but the general impression is spoiled by a few unnecessary bugs that have been present in this series of games for several years.
So, in reality, these aren't mistakes, but an expression of inexplicable developer laziness.
The adventure starts off very well.
You become part of a story where the main character, Jack, decides to solve some personal problems by participating in an illegal race across America.
You get in a car on the West Coast, in San Francisco, and your job is to be the first to get to New York.
There are some interesting features to this idea.
The route consists of ten stages, divided into more than fifty races.
This means that each race follows its own route, with individual stages taking place in a diverse and interesting environment.
So it doesn't feel like the game is the same all the time.
Although the graphics are at the same level as in previous installments of the series, some of the tracks are enjoyable to watch.
And yet the game doesn't evoke much emotion.
Although driving through the desert, the suburbs in the fall, or high in the snow-capped mountains is a delight.
And the race is occasionally animated by an unusual detail.
For example, in the desert, you get into a sandstorm that greatly reduces visibility.
On the other hand, in the mountains, you have to be careful not to get caught in an avalanche.
The individual races are pretty well organized.
There are only a few varieties, but that's enough.
For a while you're trying to outrun several rivals (essentially a normal race); then you're trying to improve your time (a standard race with a stopwatch); or you're competing against one opponent.
And you'll run into the police from time to time, which will make your job even more difficult.
The components on the outside of the car are new.
It's just an interactive animation where Jack is running away from someone most of the time and you have to help him by pressing the right buttons at the right time.
It's not complicated.
Although surprisingly, these fragments are much smaller than you might expect (only three to be exact).
It actually turns out that for a game, that's good because it's not boring; given all of the above, that's one of the things that makes the game more fun.
The racing model follows the tracks of the previous models.
It means that it's no longer something special, but that's not a flaw.
If you're looking for a real-life imitation, you'll have to look elsewhere.
And yet this driving model is very suitable for dynamic racing, although there are better options on the market.
So far, it's been great.
However, after a while, problems arise.
Unlike the driving model, the crash model is not so good.
You don't expect a game like this to be a complex conversion or a collision, but if you don't have a clue before you hit an object about how your car is going to behave, something's wrong.
Usually, when you're overtaking or driving past cars in a traffic jam, you're sometimes touching another car slightly, and yet sometimes in a situation that's almost the same, your car starts to spin wildly.
Or it was broken into pieces.
It's not that important with the restart system, but it's enough to spoil the fun.
The restarts are designed so that if you crash or go far off the track, the game takes you back to where it stopped.
However, only five restarts are available for each race.
If you use them all, you'll have to start the race from the beginning.
It's useful in case something doesn't work, but you can't rely on it completely.
Sometimes restarts aren't enough, and you have to memorize a certain part of the race.
A major drawback of the game is the fact that the same things often happen in the same places.
For example, some turns have to be done in a certain way, or you just don't fit in.
In other cases, you'll encounter civilian vehicles in a certain location in the same configuration whether you're first, fifth, five seconds early or a minute late.
This is especially annoying in situations where you see your opponent easily passing between two cars going in opposite directions, when when you're there, the cars are already positioned so you have to either go around them or slow down.
It doesn't matter when you're around them; it's all set up so that the situation is always right in front of your face.
The rivals have other advantages.
During the game, you find several places where, regardless of time, the same opponent is overtaking you in the same place.
This is especially evident at the end of the game, on a long bridge, where you're driving in the opposite direction.
Obviously, your opponent has to stand up to you no matter what.
The thing is, when it's driving in front of you, it's making your view worse, which leads to one or more accidents on that stretch.
You can understand trying to make the game more interesting and adrenaline-fueled, but it's so obvious that it quickly starts to irritate.
It's a shame, because despite the simple driving model, the game is fun and sometimes so eventful that you don't have time to pay attention to what's going on around you.
It doesn't matter what you're not bored with - a concept with fifty unique tracks, a race sequence or something else.
The idea of changing cars during races is unusual.
You need to keep track of the fuel on the way, because that's where your car can be replaced, even though in most cases the one you already have is enough.
Cars are divided into three categories.
Sports cars are for cities; powerful American cars are for straight highways; and exotic super sports cars are for technical driving, such as on curvy mountain roads.
The main story mode is closely related to the challenge mode; it is races on individual terrains that you learn as you play.
Here you win medals and points for your personal case, common to challenges and story modes.
There are many opportunities to improve driving skills, from cars to profile data.
In addition, the profile is linked to the online feature Autolog, which, among other things, compares your results with those of other players and provides a link to the public.
Here's another flaw that's hard to understand; this is an example from the last race in the sequence.
You and your car are in a subway tunnel (let's assume that) where you're racing down the tracks in the dark (let's assume that).
Your speedometer is showing the numbers from 150 to 200 km/h (let's assume that) when suddenly a subway train is coming at you from behind, turning your car into a pile of metal.
For days, our editorial staff has been debating whether we really didn't think twice about making the game, or whether the creators really think we're such idiots.
The technical aspect of the game is nothing special; but the overall experience of the video series is mostly pleasant, sometimes even amazing.
Although, unfortunately, at some critical moments, the quality of the recording, sometimes quite strongly, declines.
This is especially true in high-stakes cases where a good recording wouldn't help you much either.
The sound is fine; the soundtrack is for amateurs.
To appeal to the widest possible youth audience, the soundtrack 'has been mixed with compositions from different styles'; but it is unlikely that many people will buy the game because of its music.
Overall impression of Need for Speed: The run is rather messy.
If the game had avoided obviously unnecessary mistakes, we could honestly say that Escape is the best part of NFS in the last few years.
Anyway, the game leaves a feeling of incompleteness.
Sure, it's good entertainment, but be prepared for the flaws to blind you like airport lights.

Ambassador to the EU Vicenova:
The Czechs have a reputation for being unwelcome and skeptical of the euro.
"The Lisbon Treaty has caused considerable disagreement among individual organizations".
"I didn't expect it to be so brutal".
"It will take five or six years before the situation stabilizes, calms down and all players get used to their new roles", EU Ambassador Milena Vicenova began her lecture at the Faculty of Law with a stern tone.
She demonstrated how true to her motto "Clear and open about Europe" in the very first part of her lecture, where she described the individual EU institutions and the relationship between them in a way that was so simple and clear that many lecturers at KU Law School would have been envious.
Moreover, Vicenova praised the work of the new permanent president of the European Council, Herman Van Rompuy:
"At first, critics said he was just a gray office mouse who couldn't play any role; I have to say, everyone was amazed at how well he handled his role".
"He is a man who can listen to 27 member states at once, who is good at communicating with them and who has a clear idea of where the EU needs to go".
She explained her new position as the EU's foreign and security affairs representative as an answer to the question: "Who is the European Union? What number should I call?"; i.e. as an important step towards unification and greater transparency of the Union's policies towards countries like China or India.
No one's going to ban our cheese.
Vitsenova further focused on the programme that is key for the EU in the past, present and near future.
She called the Czech presidency a success the year before.
The Czechs were dealing with an impending financial crisis; they overcame that crisis and organized the Eastern Partnership summit.
She said that the resignation of the government at the time was a negative phenomenon that caused considerable damage to the Czech Republic.
The Czech representatives in the EU are very busy at the moment.
As the ambassador said, both the presidency and the subsequent financial crisis caused the fermentation that is now ongoing.
And we need to adopt a new seven-year EU budget, which is very difficult given the current crisis.
Whether the budget will be sparse and economical, which areas will be preferred; which countries will receive more support and which less; all these questions are in the upcoming programme.
The Ambassador recalled the key slogans she brought to Brussels: "A Europe in a language that is understood".
"I really don't like abbreviations, foreign words, and jargon that no one understands.
How can citizens understand that in Brussels people are not trying to sell curved or round cucumbers, bananas of different sizes, or that someone is going to ban our cheese varieties.'
It is also going to make more efficient use of the EU environment and attract more Czechs to European organisations.
Europe with high speeds is our future
The ambassador claims that the Czechs are considered eurosceptics; as well as people who point out the negative rather than the positive sides of things.
She wants more Czech representatives to be involved in European organizations.
She believes that this is due to several factors: for example, the modesty of our candidates and their inability to write motivation letters; at the same time with little support from the Czech side.
Along with the successful chairmanship of the Czech Republic, she noted the power and cooperation of the Visegrad Group.
"Believe me, when I meet someone from Poland and Hungary, and we have a Slovak joining us, the Frenchman next to me says, 'Hey, what's the meeting about, the Visegrad group again?' and he's not happy about it one bit.'
In the future, the Union of Vicenov expects mainly new strict rules for the budgetary policy of the member states.
Compared to the new European Federation, it finds the idea of a two-speed, if not a multi-speed Europe, more realistic.
"We have countries both inside and outside the Eurozone".
"We have the Schengen area, and we already have the institute of enhanced cooperation".
"It was said for the first time that countries that want to join should join, while those that don't want to join can stay out".
"The number of such institutions will grow; it will be a truly two-speed Europe", Vitsenova expects.
In this regard, she stressed the role of both the Czech Republic and Herman Van Rompuy in promoting the rule that all issues affecting the EU as a whole should be discussed by all member states, not just those in the Eurozone.
The history of the brand:
The pioneer IBM is entering its second century.
If someone wants to find a word that best describes IMB's strategy, the closest one is probably "long-term".
For the general public, IBM is a symbol of the technological revolution; the company is considered very modern, although it was founded more than a hundred years ago.
The company's longevity was laid by its first boss, the visionary Thomas J. Watson Sr.
He believed in his motto that many of the world's problems could be easily solved if people were willing to think.
His slogan "Think!" thus became the stamp around which the future giant's life revolved (as well as the title of his internal magazine, which IMB began publishing in 1935).
Moreover, it was the foundation of the corporate culture that Watson carefully constructed.
"For us at IBM, long-term thinking means constantly moving forward.
IBM survived and prospered for a hundred years because it remained true to its original values, even though it was not afraid to change everything around it.
In our first hundred years, it has allowed us to transform technology, business and society.
In the next 100 years, we hope to achieve even more", said Samuel J. Palmisano, the company's current CEO, on the occasion of the anniversary.
A complex system
In the 1930s, Watson approached the issue of employee care the same way Batya did in the Czech Republic - IMB employees were among the first American employees with paid leave, employer insurance, elegant uniforms, and a complex system of bonuses for the best inventors and entrepreneurs.
IBM's long-term relationship with consumers is also advanced.
From the very beginning, the company found brilliant applications for talented people, and it was one of the first companies in the world to eliminate all discrimination, giving it a great choice.
It's consistent with the anti-discrimination strategy and the current plan, where a woman, Virginia Rometti, will replace Palmisano next year.
She worked at IBM for thirty years; she is currently the Director of Sales, Marketing and Development.
For the past few years, IBM has been hosting meetings, online brainstorming sessions, where many of the future innovations are being thought out.
It's no wonder there's a lot of ideas -- about half a million people working at the company.
A good organization
A strong position in the business is secured by a strong internal and external image.
"From the beginning, in terms of the concept, IBM was more of an organization than a technology company", said Harvard Business School professor and IBM book author Rosabeth Moss Kanter to The Economist.
"IBM is not a technology company, it is a company that helps solve business problems with technology", adds George Colony of consulting firm Forrester Research.
As the company says, there's a difference between going out and creating a market.
In a hundred years, IBM, or the Blue Giant, as it is known in the United States for its logo, has grown into one of the largest companies in the world.
It seems to be the most versatile technology company -- developing hardware and software, infrastructure, hosting and consulting services -- from servers to nanotechnology.
It has the most patents of any American technology company, and five of its employees have won the Nobel Prize.
Her inventions include, for example, the ATM, the bank card, the financial swap, the barcode, and the floppy disk.
With $220 billion in market capitalization, IBM this year became the second-largest technology company (first place to Apple), surpassing Microsoft for the first time since 1996.
Looking ahead
Not all of its products were to the taste of the customers and fit the era. For example, IBM failed with its OS/2 operating system, Prodigy online service and IBM PCjr computers.
"If your business is defined by moving forward, you can't be emotionally attached to the past", says Samuel J. Palmisano.
That's why IBM is so quick to build the foundation on multiple platforms -- if they don't work, they abandon them.
This is what differentiates it from, for example, its competitor Microsoft, which is based on and experiencing a downturn on Windows, its operating system.
The future of technology
IBM's main income comes from services, with about one-fifth of each coming from computer software and hardware.
Whereas in 1990, with twice the capital, it was the strongest hardware company.
Since 2000, IBM has sold $15 billion worth of low-yield assets, while investing $58 billion in promising technologies.
It continued to invest even after 2008, when the current economic crisis first hit the world.
IBM is following in the footsteps of its first CEO, Thomas J. Watson, who increased investment during the Great Depression.
So far, IBM seems to have been spared the current crisis.
Since the beginning of 2008, the price of IBM's stock has risen by a record 120 percent; the company's net earnings have been steadily rising.
IBM's corporate motto is to change everything but our own values.
So you can expect that even if another crisis breaks out, this resilient giant will cope.
The story of IBM: from the cheese knife to space flight.
IBM (International Business Machines) was founded in New York City a hundred years ago, and its original name was "Computing, Tabling, Record Corporation", which was a pretty complicated name.
It took the name IBM in 1924, originally used for the company's offices in Canada and South America.
The foundations of the future IBM were laid by the merger of four companies, whose history begins in the 1880s.
They had technologies like the legendary "table clock", which is a clock that records when employees come in and go out of work.
The architect of the new company was businessman Charles Ranlett Flint, who until 1930 also headed the company's board of trustees.
Flint hired a rival company director, Thomas J. Watson, to help him run the company.
Then the CEO pushed the IBM founder into the shadows - Watson's ideas remain the basis of the firm's culture and individuality.
Watson headed the company until 1952.
IBM, as the name implies, started out manufacturing and selling a variety of equipment for the business -- from cheese knives and meat cutters to cash registers.
Within the first four years of Watson's tenure, revenues doubled to $9 million, and the company began a massive expansion across all continents.
Watson became so important to the company that almost forty years later his son, Thomas Watson, Jr., took his place in the chair of the board.
Under his leadership, IBM began developing artificial intelligence technologies and created the first programming language.
In the 1960s, both IBM employees and computers helped NASA control spaceflights to Mercury, Saturn, and in 1969 the manned flight to the Moon.
Meanwhile, in 1964, IBM developed the first family of computers - the IBM line System/360.
The classic PC that defined the computer standards of the time, called the IBM 5150, appeared on the market in 1981.
Twenty years later, IBM sold its computer manufacturing to the Chinese company Lenovo, simultaneously buying the consulting division of PricewaterhouseCoopers, thus concentrating entirely on consulting and high value-added services.
Over the last three years, IBM has made great strides with their Smarter Planet concept.
Its aim is to make wise use of technology in areas where it has not yet been planned and to improve road conditions and urban governance.
In the commercial space, IBM recently introduced the Smarter Commerce platform, which helps businessmen control the entire business cycle.
IBM traditions are strong even in our country.
In the former Czechoslovakia, as the first country to be located simultaneously in Central and Eastern Europe, IBM established its branch in 1932.
Today IBM CZ also manages a strategic outsourcing center in Brno.
The headquarters for Central and Eastern Europe are in Prague, where a world-class research group on speech recognition is also based.
Richterjova about her unfaithful husband:
Iveta, keep the fool, I don't need him anymore!
Darina Richtarzhoova, 53, said it was over!
After her husband Josef Richtarz (53) became her bodyguard and lover, Darin still hoped that he would wake up and return home.
However, she doesn't want to wait any longer, and has set clear rules for her future life.
"Pepa can come home, but not as my partner", Richterzhoeva explained.
When Darina Richtarzhowa gave Bartoshov shelter in her home in the summer, she probably had no idea what would happen to her marriage.
And although she forced Yvette to leave Rjičán 30 days later, Pepa did not leave the singer.
Moreover, he publicly confessed his love for her.
After a while, Darina gave up, pretending to have put up with her husband's affair; and now she had said goodbye to him for good.
Richar doesn't care who his wife sleeps with.
Even if Richter and Bartoshov ever part, his wife won't welcome him with open arms.
"He is the biological father of my sons and if he wants to spend his last days in our house, no one will turn him away".
"However, he will end his days not as my beloved, lost and found old fool, but as a man with whom I have something to connect", Richterzhoeva said, adding that she has already freed herself from her husband and insists only on mutual decency.
So far, Joseph has nothing against his wife rejecting him.
"I respect my wife's decision".
"I'm going to be with Yvette, I'm not going to change that".
"My wife has decided to keep the marriage on paper, and I respect that decision".
"Our union is still functioning; I am responsible for the repairs, the garden, the house and the shopping".
"Darina and I communicate perfectly well, except we don't share the bed anymore", Richarge told Blesk magazine.
He claims that if Richterjova finds a new love, he won't stop her.
"We don't sleep together, and I don't care where she goes, who she's with, or if she has a boyfriend.
I know it's my fault, I fell in love with Yvette and I take full responsibility", Joseph concluded.
Bad Habits of Women - Do They Affect You?
When you ask men to name some of the typical bad habits of women, they usually list them all at once.
Ladies, would you recognize yourself in the following lines describing some of the female habits that make men angry?
Shopping
Your other half complains about you going shopping all the time?
Do you need to buy at least one thing every week?
Do you like to shop at the big auctions?
If so, your shopping may be a bad habit.
Some women admit that they need to control their shopping habits.
Yet, who among you would not want to walk through a clothing store looking for the perfect fit and try it out (preferably in different colors) in a sample shop?
Shopping may be a hobby for most women, but for men it can be hell.
Just think how many times you've told your other half to wait outside...
The eternal discontent
"Am I too fat?"
"I need to lose at least five pounds - maybe I should start doing gymnastics?"
"Are you still attracted to me?"
Are you familiar with these phrases?
- You did?
Then you're one of those women who's obsessed with their looks.
Not that you should stop looking after yourself, but many men are literally allergic to their partner's constant complaints about their appearance.
The stronger sex also agrees that the more frequently such complaints occur, the more women irritate them.
Order and cleanliness are the most important things
It's like a never-ending story.
Washing windows, vacuuming, washing floors, dust wiping, cleaning the bathroom - at least twice a week.
You criticize your partner for stepping on a clean stove in dirty shoes; kids for dirt in a clean sink and fingerprints on a living room window that was so hard to clean?
If you suffer from this "disturbance", try to realize that it is not good to go to extremes; and that order and cleanliness should not be the primary concern in your family.
A harmless pursuit of cleanliness can threaten your relationship, as well as your family.
The desire to command
"Throw your laundry in the trash".
"Are you going to wear dirty socks tomorrow?"
"Wet dish towels should not be on the floor".
If you make remarks to your partner several times a day, he may find it very annoying.
Of course you mean well, you just want everything to be perfect.
Maybe if men understood that, women wouldn't have to command them so often...
The gossip.
Some women like to gossip, insult, and plot against others.
Women are focused on relationships, so they like to discuss who, where, with whom, how, and why.
I suppose we all gossip from time to time.
Let's be honest, it seems to be the nature of all women.
However, there are more serious gossips, women who often gossip and despise others, and they, especially in the female workforce, are a great danger to their environment.
Yager and Vorashek 's results helped Philadelphia win .
During Monday's NHL game, two effective passes by forward Jaromir Jagr helped Philadelphia win the game 5-3 on the Carolina ice, and he again became the most productive Czech player of the game.
In both cases, Claude Giroux used the experience of the thirty-nine-year-old star; he added another pass and was declared the best player of the match.
Two of the game's effective passes also belonged to Yakubu Voraschek, who played in the same team as Jagr.
After the match, Jagr told foreign journalists that he predicted a great evening for Gir.
"I told him before the game he'd score a hat-trick".
"I felt it".
"Sometimes you feel these things", explained Jagr, whose actions led to Giroud scoring the first goal the Flyers gave him.
A little later, the team's second goal also had a "Czech trace".
Hurricane Voráček took the puck and passed it to Maxim Talbot, who scored between the rounds.
A second before the first break, home plate player Patrick Dwyer narrowed the gap with the numbers up, but the Flyers were back in the lead early in the second half.
Especially Giro.
After the Yager's effective delivery, he scored a third goal; his shot was later converted into a fourth by Wayne Simmonds.
"I like playing with him".
"I don't want to say he's the best player in the league, but he's definitely in the top three", Jagr said, praising his center fielder.
"I never thought I'd end up playing with a hockey player like him".
"It makes me happy".
"I want to support him".
"All these years in the NHL, my teammates tried to help me, and now it was my turn", Jagr added.
Carolina made the match more dramatic with the help of Tuomo Rout and Dwyer's penalty, narrowing the gap to one goal.
Further complications were prevented by Matt Reed, who increased the gap to two points.
"Pronger was doing great in our area".
"He hit the puck, I accelerated, and Reed went to the far end".
"I aimed at him and I'm glad it worked", Voráček described his impression of the last goal of the match.
The win moved Philadelphia to first place in the Eastern Conference.
Montreal's Czech defender Jaroslav Шпачек did not finish the game against Buffalo; he left the game in the second period due to an upper body injury.
Along with the experienced defender, the Canadiens lost their two-point lead and lost 3-3 after the penalty shootout.
Tomasz Plekanec failed to score during one of their attacks.
More than the missing points, the home coach was upset by the large number of injuries in the back row as the match ended with only five defenders.
"It's not good".
"We ended the game with only one experienced player, the rest were young people".
"Anyway, there's nothing we can do about it, we just have to accept it", said Jacques Martin.
"Switch after switch, it was amazing and we couldn't resist".
"We had to simplify the game, move the puck out of our zone".
"What was our weakness", added defender P.K. Subban
After thirty attacks, Czech goalkeeper Onjay Pavelets helped Winnipeg defeat Tampa Bay 5-2.
The Jets' goals, which interrupted a five-game losing streak, were scored by five different players.
The price dynamics for travel since 1989
Until 1989, only five state tourist agencies were allowed to operate in the former Czechoslovakia: Čedok, Sporturist, CKM, Rekrea and Autoturist.
As travel to the West was strictly restricted, travel agencies of the time mostly sold tours to the countries of the socialist bloc.
Thus, on holidays, Czech tourists went to the German Democratic Republic; the Soviet Union (Sochi, Crimea on the Black Sea); Bulgaria; Romania (both countries on the Black Sea); and Hungary (Balaton).
The only exception was the period from 1962 to 1972, when we had the opportunity to travel to Yugoslavia, and then the Yugoslav regime turned to the West, which led to significant restrictions on Czech tourists' travel to Yugoslavia.
The great paradox of the socialist period was that citizens of the socialist bloc (i.e. Czechoslovakia) were not allowed individual trips to socialist countries.
If a citizen of Czechoslovakia wanted to travel alone, for example to the Soviet Union or Poland, an invitation letter from that country was required; otherwise individual travel was impossible.
At the time, travel agencies offered trips to the West, but you had to either stand in line all night with a sleeping bag or have "good friends" in the agency.
And that wasn't all.
Currency permits were required for travel to the West, and were not issued to politically unreliable people who were not allowed to travel at all.
The Czechoslovak currency was not freely convertible; without a currency permit it was impossible to obtain money (western currency) for a trip to the West.
Most often, the Czechs spent their holidays at home, which led to the appearance of a large number of cottages and summer houses, this custom is preserved to this day.
After 1989, tourism in the Czech Republic experienced a real revolution.
Whereas until 1989 a holiday in the GDR or Bulgaria was the culmination of our travels, last year the Czechs spent 4.5 million holidays in countries around the world.
The great paradox that we no longer realize is that until 1989, we couldn't freely visit what is now the most popular country in Croatia, because it was part of the former Yugoslavia.
In the early 1990s, the visa requirement for neighboring Western European countries was abolished, and a huge wave of short trips, mainly to Vienna and Germany, began.
The Czechs could not get enough of traveling to the West.
For example, in Paris, Czech tourists slept in parks in tents, as their income at the time was not enough to pay for a hotel or boarding house.
A typical feature of Czech tourism in that period was the desire to bring their own food (cans, salami, etc.) to save money.
Another important point is the introduction of the freely convertible Czech krone, which after decades has allowed our tourists to buy Western currencies freely.
Our standard of living and average income were rising, which led to another important circumstance around 1997.
Since 1997, increased demand has allowed travel agencies to arrange regular flights operated by charter airlines, and flights have become incredibly cheap now thanks to the possibility of ordering wholesale discounts.
By the late 1990s, Czechs didn't need a visa to visit almost all the developed countries of the world except the United States, which made our travel even easier.
The next significant event in the history of travel after the revolution occurred in 2000, when a huge demand led to the first ever direct charter flight from the Czech Republic to the exotic country of Thailand.
Since then, direct charter flights have taken Czech tourists to warm exotic countries.
Today, about 100,000 Czechs visit exotic countries each year!
And another important event of this period, symbolizing our development after the revolution, happened in 2008.
On November 17, 2008, the United States abolished the visa requirement for Czech tourists, and our country joined the ranks of the world's most developed countries.
For the first time in history, in 2008, Czechs spent more than half of their holidays abroad (50.3%); and for the first time in history, they spent more than 15 thousand crowns per person during their holiday abroad, including their expenses at the destination.
The General Assembly must elect a president, the threat of a pat returns
For about five months, Czech football has not had a president, and there is a risk that Ivan Gašek's successor, the head of the Czech Football Association (FAČR), will not be named even after another extraordinary general meeting, which will take place in Nimburck on Tuesday.
There's still no consensus on what election rules to follow.
Without that, the vote for one of the three candidates will not begin.
Jindrih Reichl, Miroslav Pelta and Tomáš Patlick are all eager to lead the Czech football.
Gashek resigned in June, urging his colleagues to unite and find a strong personality to lead football in the future.
However, the Gashek era has again plunged football into a quarrel between the two chambers of the association, which cannot choose a single candidate.
This became very clear on September 16th, when a new president was to be elected.
Delegates of the general assembly came to the National House in Prague, Smihov, for nothing, because the negotiations remained blocked, not only by the procedure of the elections.
There was no agreement on who was entitled to vote at the general meeting - only legal representatives or also officials who had been granted powers.
This point has since been partially settled by the recommendation of the Institute of State and Law that representation based on delegated powers is impossible.
Disputes over the election rules, however, continue.
The Executive Council has not been much help either, although at its regular and extraordinary meetings it is mostly concerned with this very issue.
The idea of voting has changed several times, but the key question remains the same.
The question is, how do you get to the third round and avoid the pat?
"The question is whether to follow the established norms or find another model", says one of FAČR vice-presidents, Dushan Svoboda, who represents professional football in the association's management.
Based on the model provided by the charter, the winner of the 3rd round is the candidate who has received the most support from the chamber from which he is a candidate.
Moravia is reportedly willing to compromise on the winner of the election with the largest number of votes in both chambers.
The Czech side insists on the condition that the overall winner must get at least two-thirds of the vote.
"However, the previous two rounds would then lose their meaning; it would completely reject the concept of two chambers", Svoboda agrees with Moravia's arguments.
Tomasz Patslik agrees with him, though he believes the election rules set out in the constitution are more in Pelt's favor than other candidates.
"I would like the election to be held as legally as possible".
"I want to avoid all the representative nonsense like at the previous general meeting", says Victoria's owner Plzen, who is a first-time candidate; and in his remarks he largely contradicted Pelte.
Pelta remains optimistic.
He believes the new president will be well known in Nimburg; he also hopes that the candidates will cooperate constructively in the future.
"All the emotional ferment will calm down after today's expected national team's appearance in the European Championship".
"Football will be back on a happy wave, people will be more willing to cooperate", says a spokesman for Jablonec. Of the three candidates, he has the most experience in football management at both professional and regional levels.
Reichl is more restrained.
"I hope for a deal, but the situation is very ambiguous".
"It's not between Bohemian and Moravian representatives, but there are attempts to deliberately adapt the rules".
"This could cause another disruption to the general meeting".
"I hope common sense wins", said Reichl.
There's not much time left for the parties to reach an agreement.
According to some reports, some negotiations took place directly in Montenegro; but who knows if football unity will be achieved before the match.
An additional flight, which was supposed to take, among others, vice-presidents Dalibor Kucher and Reichl to Podgorica, did not leave Prague in the morning due to a technical malfunction.
After all, the ministerial meeting expected on Wednesday could be decisive.
Minister of Education, Youth and Sports, Józef Dobesh, would like the opposing sides in the strongest sports association in the country to come to an agreement.
A lot is at stake: government subsidies; the creditworthiness of football; and the planned general meeting of ČSTV with the new Czech sports directorate after the financial problems of Sazka.
Patzlik enters the presidential race because he doesn't see the right candidate.
If the head of football in Plzeň, Tomáš Patlick, had seen a strong candidate before the extraordinary general meeting, who would have met all his requirements for the president of the Football Association of the Czech Republic (FAČR), he would not have even claimed the high post.
"If there was a worthy candidate, I would fight for him and not participate in the struggle myself".
"But we haven't found such a person yet", Patlik told ČTK.
The motive of Patlik's entry into the struggle with Miroslav Pelt and Jindrih Reichl was to try to prevent Pelt, the supposed favourite of the elections, from entering the FAČR.
Moreover, Patslik emphasizes that if he wins, he will only remain president until 2013, when the next general assembly is scheduled.
In the future, he would like to see this position taken by an experienced top manager, not too involved in football life.
"I've spoken to a few people who might be of interest".
"I was horrified to hear some of them say that they don't even want to have anything to do with Czech football at the moment".
"I'd like to change that opinion", he said.
At present, the main disagreement between Pelt and Patslik is related to the latter's relationship with Roman Berbr, president of the regional football association in Plzen. Berbr is a man of controversial reputation, who is known behind the scenes as an influential lobbyist, able to influence the votes of delegates of the general assembly.
Patzlik, therefore, considers it unacceptable that Pelto should become president.
"If he wins, the current situation will remain unchanged and football will not move forward".
"With the support of Berber, a capable businessman, it would be even more damaging to football", said Patslik.
He alludes to the fact that Pelta's name was recorded during a phone tapping in a corruption investigation several years ago; Pelta managed to avoid a conviction.
"I don't know what prestige a Pelt victory would bring to football".
"And how we would look in the eyes of UEFA and FIFA", said Patslik, who now does not mention his earlier statement that he would "sell Plzen if Pelta becomes president".
If Patzlik wins on Thursday, he could envision working with Pelta in the future.
This view is shared by another candidate, Reichl, whom Patzlik endorsed before the September general assembly, which ended in a fiasco.
"He (Pelta) would be the first person I would turn to".
'He is very capable.'
"I can see him in charge of the team".
"But he can't run the association".
"I don't stick my nose in what I don't know", said Patslik, who attracted a lot of attention in September when he supported the removal of a judges' brigade led by Ludek Macela, who was replaced by Dagmar Damkov.
Patzlik claims he's willing to risk running the association.
He cites his experience managing private companies; since last summer he has managed the Plzeň team, which with his help celebrated its first league triumph in May.
"I have the power to change the football environment, to support its change for the better".
"To limit the influence of certain groups of individuals who tend to influence the disciplinary and appeal board, which leads to disgusting situations", said Patslik.
One of his priorities will be to strengthen the relationship between FAČR and the Czech Olympic Committee, with the help of which he will lobby at the highest political level for more money to be allocated to sports from lottery fees.
"This is one of the key issues a new president should address".
"If gambling is taxed, as the political parties claim, I understand their arguments, but they should state clearly where the money is going", he said.
Patlick does not consider his relationship with the Plzeň club a burden, although he argues that the president of FAČR should be independent.
Pelto is connected to the Jablonian, and Reichl to the Prague Dukes.
"This is not ideal".
"I still don't see the point in hypocritically transferring my shares of the Plzeň club to someone else when I'm going back there in six months", says Patslik.
Pelta promised new FAČR rules that will avoid the Electoral Path
Two days before the general meeting of the football association, one of the presidential candidates, Miroslav Pelta, promised that if elected, he would fight for the new FAČR rules to avoid future disputes over the election rules.
Until Thursday's talks in Nimburgo, the Jablonec official remains optimistic and believes that the focus of the campaign will be significantly diverted by today's expected success of our football team.
Before the failed election in September, Pelta promised that if he won, he would focus on both representation and fundraising.
He decided to contest the election at the last minute before the last general assembly, a two-month delay which could thus be useful for him to defend his ideas about football in a wider context.
"People at all levels have been in football for a long time, and they expect the president to be announced on Thursday".
"They feel it's time for someone to lead the association", claims a man mainly associated with the Jablonsky club; but he has spent many years in Sparta and the association's executive committee.
This gives him reason to believe that he is experienced enough to manage Czech football.
He believes that the current problems are caused by the euphoria that reigned during the reign of Ivan Gashek.
"Unfortunately, rules that were not as perfect as we all thought were adopted at the general meeting in June".
"If the different representation methods had not been adopted, we would have had a president by September", Pelta said.
He regarded the rewriting of the key document of the civil association as a false target for the delegates.
"If I become president, I will consider it my personal mission, and I am going to take personal responsibility if this attempt fails".
"This is a fundamental question without which we cannot exist", says Pelta.
Besides, he says he's not trying to stand out from his rivals.
He has stated in the past that he can imagine working with Jindrich Reichl, whom he values for his legal education; he is well aware of the fact that his rival candidate should become his first vice president.
For a long time he did not attack Thomas Patzlik, who constantly criticized Pelt.
"He's been in football for over a year and has had some success".
"However, his attacks were indecent, and many people were surprised by his campaign methods".
"That's why some of them are now doubting his true identity", Pelta said of his rival, who claims he is loyal to the declarations he made in September.
He considers his main weapon knowledge of football, from competitions at the lowest level to the national team.
The national team should represent all of football.
"I would also try to stop all incidents, starting with the Bohemian case or the aftermath of last year's corruption scandal".
"Immediately after that I would focus on negotiations with both the private and public sectors to guarantee sufficient money for all football", the 46-year-old candidate told ČTK two months ago.
He then promised that his election to the post of head of football would not lead to staff layoffs.
"I'll need to know the job instructions of individual employees". That was his message to the Insurance Department, where the long intergovernmental period causes understandable nervousness.
Despite the current disastrous scenarios that accompany the planned general meeting, he believes that delegates will arrive in Nimburg on Thursday for a reason.
"If the only issue is how to conduct a third round, we can handle that".
"Football needs the confidence it can get only by finally electing its leader", says Pelta, who remains optimistic two days before the pivotal day of his career as a public servant.
Reichl promises that under his leadership, the FAČR will start to work actively
If at Thursday's meeting, Jindřich Reichl, the current vice president, becomes president of the Czech Football Association, many people in the Association, according to rumors, will be unhappy.
Rachel promises that if he's elected, it'll be a time of hard work.
He wants to change the system and make the executive committee members responsible for specific areas of football.
He also promises to solve the Bohemian problem; improve relations with both UEFA and FIFA; attract more money to football; and continue the work of the previous president, Ivan Gašek.
"As president, I'd like to focus on football in general".
"From international contacts with UEFA and FIFA, to national team, professional football and youth football events".
"I don't mean that I'm going to do everything myself", Reichl said in an interview with ČTK.
"I'm a team player, and I want to distribute authority on the executive committee so that each member focuses on a specific area".
"I'm going to be careful about assigning tasks so that football makes big strides in each of these segments".
"This is probably not going to be a lot of people's thing, because it's going to mean hard work, not just criticizing the work of others", he added.
The atmosphere of criticism in the football movement supposedly made him doubt his candidacy.
"Because I know I work 20 hours a day".
"But I need to know if it makes sense; and that I won't be surrounded by people who stick sticks in my wheels and question my every move", he explained his doubts.
"However, many people told me that I should not give up or others would come".
"It's a trust I can't throw away", he said.
Moreover, he says his motivation is to continue the work he started with Gashek.
"A lot of work has been done in the last two years, and I don't want to cross that out".
"Processes have been started that can bring results in a few years, and I don't want anyone else to stop them", he said, fearing that if another candidate, Miroslav Pelta, is elected, the situation in the Association could return to what it was before Gashek.
"I believe in a systematic approach, and that's something that Mirek Pelt is hardly competent at".
"He's surrounded by people who would play football in a way that's only accessible to the select few".
"I can be accused of many things, but certainly not of subjectivity".
"I'm trying to be objective".
"I want to make football accessible to everyone, because then everyone will have a good time, not just a select minority", Reichl said.
Moreover, he denies the accusations that he will only be president of the Czech Republic.
"Although many people try to argue the opposite, I plan to do my best for Moravia".
"For example, it is time to think about dividing the second league into the Czech and Moravian parts, the winners of which would continue the fight in the first league".
"This will prevent the current situation where there are only three Moravian teams in the league, which is a problem for young players in Moravia", said Reichl.
While the presidential race was entered by the manager of the club Plzeň Tomáš Patlick, Reichl does not dare to assess his chances of victory.
"However, I still feel strong support in the Czech Chamber, which elected me as its vice president, and I see that I have achieved some obvious successes", said Reichl. Among his successes he attributes saving tens of millions of kroner on unprofitable contracts, negotiating television contracts and negotiating a lottery law.
On the other hand, he blames himself in part for the lack of unity in the association.
Claiming that Pelta was "excluded from the process of returning the creditworthiness to Czech football", he considers another rival, Patzlik, a strong candidate who has something to offer.
"No one can doubt that he has done a great job in Plzen this year".
"If elected, I hope he will continue what Ivan Gashek started, without significant personnel changes in the committees".
"He wouldn't twist the facts to his advantage", Reichl said of his rival.

Lying on her back in the water, she gazed up at the tastefully decorated domes, swam to the marble cherubs waiting for her at the edge of the pool, and admired the carefully restored art nouveau swimming pools.
She was quick to add each pool she liked to her notebook - with important details about the building's construction and history.
Architectural historian Meder has examined more than 200 swimming pools - and now has gathered her impressions in her recently published book Badefreuden (The Joy of Swimming), which covers everything from public swimming pools in Munich to historic bathing palaces in the Black Forest and "functional concrete buildings" in the Taunus.
Her "journey to the most unusual baths in Central Europe" took her through 13 countries, including Germany, Austria and Switzerland, as well as baths in Italy, France, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania and Poland - and one city each in Luxembourg, Serbia and Croatia.
The 46-year-old author is a true enthusiast of swimming culture.
She has little enthusiasm for sports, says Mather, but in the water, things are different.
The only drawback is that swimming enthusiasts have to put up with the blue coffee plates and the smell of chlorine, whereas runners can breathe the enticing smell of pine forests or listen to the joyful chirping of birds in the park.
"I once asked myself why swimming pools always have to be so awful", says Meder, who lives in Vienna.
"So I started collecting beautiful pools".
When the surface doubles the architecture
The splashing in the pool and the refined oils in the sauna are so important to the health of the baths because, according to Mader, they stimulate all the senses.
And swimming pools can be a real eye-pleasure if the builders take the time to do it.
"The surface is very transparent, but it also reflects the beauty of the whole building".
Everything is reflected visually: high ceilings, colored tiles and trampolines.
The 190-page illustrated edition of The Joy of Swimming provides valuable information about the architectural and cultural history of health oases - and makes you want to jump in the water.
Collector Meder found several outstanding specimens during her research in Hungary.
She found water rich in nitrates in a karst cave (the Cave Bath in Michkolz-Tapolce) and a thermal bath filled with alkaline water in a building built in the shape of a bottle (Városi Termálfürdö in Jasper), as well as magnificent therapeutic baths such as the 100-year-old Baths of the Secheni in Budapest.
On the other hand, many of the heated outdoor pools in Switzerland and Austria offer a spectacular view, you can see the whole of Zurich from a rooftop pool, or you can see the snow-capped Arlberg from an outdoor pool in St. Anton, and there's a steam window that lets you see what's going on at the ski slopes.
Perhaps the most unusual design awaits swimmers in Langenfeld, where the Aqua Cathedral in Öztal looks like a UFO that has just landed in the Alps.
In winter, a pair of three open shells rise from the crater, which appear quite small against the backdrop of the Etztal Mountains.
The Alhambra in the Schwarzwald
Meder, a pool collector, didn't smell chlorine in every pool.
Many thermal baths smell like sulfur, and the Arpad baths in Bekeshchab smell like so much oil that you may find it hard to believe that you are in a healing spring.
The smell is the hydrocarbons in alkaline water, which is almost black from the sludge that sticks to the skin as soon as you dive into the pool, a certain kind of healing experience.
Iris Meder, however, at a certain point became disappointed in her search for beautiful places to swim. When she tried to visit the open pool of the Czech baths in Lugatsovice, she found that the area was sealed.
The baths designed by architect Dushan Yurkovich in 1902 were closed.
When Mather peered into the red-white-yellow windows of the Art Nouveau building, she saw weeds growing between the tiles.
One of the places where the destruction was stopped on hot tracks is the amazing swimming pool in Schwarzwald - the Palace of Thermal Water in Bad Wildbad.
The pools have already gone through three stages of construction, and you'll find not only the neo-Romanesque elements of the period after it was built in 1844, but also the Moorish Alhambra style hall, added around 1900.
After a thorough renovation in 1995, the Thermal Palace is the favorite swimming pool of pool connoisseur Iris Meder - and not just because she is originally from Schwarzwald.
"It's a real achievement to combine so many different architectural styles", says Mather.
Diving into a thermal pool in a palace like this is obviously a secondary activity.
Speculation in agricultural products
Dairy Bank is investigating the agricultural trade.
I 'm not sure .
Will Deutsche Bank stop trading in agricultural products?
According to SPIEGEL ONLINE, Josef Akkermann has assigned a working group to investigate the effects of speculation on the poor around the world.
The CEO plans to make changes in January.
I 'm going to Hamburg .
The situation is clear for German citizens: according to one survey, 84 percent of Germans find it unacceptable that banks speculate on agricultural products such as wheat and corn.
Two-thirds of those surveyed demand that Deutsche Bank and other banks stop trading in agricultural products, as trade exacerbates the problems facing the poorest people around the world.
The findings were made in a study conducted by the Institute for Social Research and Statistical Analysis Forsa on behalf of the consumer organization Foodwatch.
The study is based on a report released by Foodwatch in mid-October.
The report's author, Harold Schuman, demonstrates that betting on the world's commodity markets raises prices - and banks are thus involved in global hunger.
The consumer advocacy campaign is directed directly against Deutsche Bank head Josef Akkermann, although major banking houses such as Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley trade the same.
Originally, commodity rates were intended as a means of protecting traders from price fluctuations.
Anyway, most experts now agree that the players have abandoned the rules of supply and demand and are profiting at the expense of the poorest.
Unlike competitors in the United States, Ackermann responded to criticism by pledging to investigate the allegations and stating that no trade "is worth risking the good reputation of Deutsche Bank".
According to SPIEGEL ONLINE, an international working group is currently investigating the allegations contained in the Foodwatch report.
The investigation should be completed by the end of the year, when the results will be presented to the board of directors of Deutsche Bank - with recommendations for action.
The bank's chief then plans to announce the changes following the investigation in late January.
Trade in goods may decline or cease altogether.
Ackermann is working on his image.
Foodwatch President Tilo Bode welcomed the news, stressing his critical attitude to the financial sector: "Betting on rising food prices is a blatant example of how recklessly banks are now acting against the common good".
As the bank's chief lobbyist, Ackermann has a certain obligation, according to Bode.
"The Deutsche Bank should remove from its portfolio all investments that make money bets on food prices", said Bode.
"It doesn't matter if it's starving people or the reputation of Deutsche Bank".
Ackermann's quick reaction is surprising at first, but meanwhile the director would like to have a flawless image just a few months before his tenure ends.
Deutsche Bank announced Monday that the chairman will not be joining the supervisory board as planned.
The abolition of controversial food market speculation could improve his image.
He also has little to do with the costs - the consequences will be dealt with by his successor.
One in two would turn down investment in goods.
Foodwatch is trying to keep pressure on the manager.
To date, more than 30,000 Internet users have joined the organization's campaign.
The study was conducted for the Institute for Social Research and Statistical Analysis Forsa on November 7 and 8, and 1001 people took part.
No more than 11 percent believe that investments that bet on food prices are acceptable to Deutsche Bank.
Many bank customers would also take action if they found out their bank was involved in such a trade. According to the study, one in two would withdraw deposits, which ultimately leads to commodity speculation.
43 percent would recommend leaving the bank, 49 percent said they would consider closing the account and moving to another bank.
21st century house in Vienna
Pavilion in a new location
I'm not going to lie.
The Austrian Pavilion for the 1958 World Exhibition in Brussels won prizes, became a museum in Vienna, was empty and abandoned.
Now it's being reopened as an exhibition center.
The Austrian Pavilion, designed by Karl Schwanzer for the 1958 World's Fair in Brussels, is a famous example of modern post-war architecture with its simple forms, glass halls, and boldly expressed belief in technical progress.
The Schwanzer Pavilion won the Grand Prix for architecture in 1958 for its lightweight steel and glass structure.
The building is considered a milestone in modern architecture.
This made the architect so famous that he also built the Austrian pavilion at the next World's Fair.
He eventually became world famous in 1973 with his legendary four-cylinder BMW tower and its sister, the bowl-shaped building.
The pavilion, conceived as a temporary exhibition building, was moved to the Swiss Garden near Vienna's South Station, converted and opened as the 20th Century Museum in 1962 - and is often referred to as the "House of the 20th Century" for this reason.
However, the building was not suitable for the museum for technical and spatial reasons - it had no walls on which to hang artworks, and poor air conditioning.
However, it continued to be used until modern art in Vienna got a new home.
The house had been vacant since 2001 and was in a state of deterioration.
Architect Adolf Krishaniitz has now restored the pavilion, which has been named the "House of the 21st Century" and will be used as a museum of modern art.
This museum is a branch of the Belvedere Museum, which will open its first exhibition on Tuesday evening - in every sense a joyous event.
Agnes Husslane-Arko, who became the new director of the Austrian Belvedere Gallery in 2007, helped to launch the new venture.
Husslyn-Arko, an art history graduate with a brilliant career as a figure skater in her youth, who worked at Sotheby's, the Guggenheim Museum and eventually became the founder and director of the Museum of Modern Art in Salzburg, convinced politicians and curators to continue the reconstruction, attracted public funds and private donations, and made a decision on how the building would be used.
The new museum was to house the permanent exhibition of the Fritz Votruba Foundation, a café and a bookstore along with modern art.
Strict control and limited budget
Krushnitz was the perfect candidate to run the project.
He was known, of course, for the restoration and expansion of the Josef Olbrich Vienna Secession, and won the competition, but he also studied with Schwanzer at the Vienna University of Technology, and the pavilion was for him "an extremely important place" where he visited exhibitions "almost every week".
He knew the original design and he knew the challenges that lay ahead of the building, a building that had already lost some of its grandeur and lightness when it was moved to Vienna and transformed.
The problems that arose during the last reconstruction were much more serious.
The window profiles on the glass facade were replaced, glass fiber reinforced safety glass was inserted, and the glass roof was replaced with high-strength safety glass.
The steel overlays of the thermal bridge were reinforced or replaced, and asbestos was removed from the ceilings.
The two lower floors created space for the new use of the building, the overhanging light well between the building and the street provides lighting - a practically new building, but still the elegant Schwanzer pavilion.
The original exterior doors were preserved, and the building was painted in the old red-brown color of corrosion protection.
The cinema hall is the same as it was before.
All this under strict control of the museum's management and with a limited budget.
"We often had to find material that was good, cheap, and would be approved by the museum board", says Krzyszantz, pointing to the uneven floor in the basement.
The building has remained flexible and light despite limitations, problems and transformations.
Krushnitz recently noted that the pavilion "from Brussels" was a rough one - a typical "drop in town" story.
This architecture is "not always in place" and yet it wants to "stimulate real awareness".
The 21st-century house is in a very good place, as the city's planning has been unexpectedly fortunate: a completely redesigned "main station quarter" with offices and residential real estate grows around the Swiss Garden.
A second happy event may occur: the 21st-century house may be supplemented by a second building by Krushnitz - collector Francesca von Habsburg has purchased the Berlin Provisional Exhibition Hall and is reportedly negotiating with the city to place it next door in the Swiss Garden.
Deutsche Bahn is planning a multi-million winter crisis package
Deutsche Bahn has unveiled an anti-crisis plan to avoid cancelling trains in winter.
The number of employees should double.
The cost is going to be millions of euros.
According to the newspaper, Deutsche Bahn will spend an additional 70 million euros this year to avoid winter cancellations and train delays.
Referring to Deutsche Bahn's internal crisis plan, the Bild newspaper reports that investments totalling about 300 million euros are planned for 2015.
The investments are intended to improve the performance of locomotives and the railway network even in extreme weather conditions.
The number of own and contracted staff involved in clearing snow from the tracks and platforms will be doubled to 16,000.
The goal is to clear the platforms of snow and ice before the start of work and 90 percent of the required arrows within four to five hours.
Rüdiger Grube, head of Deutsche Bahn, warned of the possibility of train cancellations and delays this winter at a meeting with government and industry leaders two months ago.
Last winter, Deutsche Bahn experienced significant difficulties with passenger services because it lacked reserves at a time of deteriorating weather conditions.
Many new regional trains had to wait years for approval from the Federal Railroad Service.
There were also some delays with ICE train service.
Deutsche Bahn also had to check the axles of ICE trains much more often for many years after one of the ICE trains broke the axle at the main station in Cologne.
The Daimler Bank will pay a multi-million pound fine in the US
New troubles followed the unrest surrounding Joseph Ackermann, the CEO of Deutsche Bank: Deutsche Bank is facing a multi-million pound fine in the US.
As if the bank had had little trouble at home, the industrial giant's past in the United States now haunts it. Frankfurt-based Deutsche Bank will pay $145 million (€106 million) to settle disputes that arose after the bankruptcy of five major credit unions during the financial crisis.
The problem was the sale of mortgage bonds.
The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA), the financial market regulator, accuses a number of the largest banks of using false promises to trick credit unions into buying their financial products.
The price of bonds fell sharply during the financial crisis and dragged down credit unions.
"We are pleased that this matter was resolved without the parties going to court", said a spokesman for Deutsche Bank in New York.
The bank did not admit guilt in the settlement.
The same is true for Citigroup, which agreed to pay $20.5 million.
NCUA President Debbie Matz welcomed the swift response from both banks.
The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA), is responsible for U.S. credit unions and intervenes in bankruptcy proceedings to protect consumer deposits.
NCUA is fighting to recover the damages, which are pouring in billions.
This is the first agreement of its kind.
The regulator also turned its attention to other major banks and in the summer filed cases against JPMorgan Chase, Royal Bank of Scotland and Goldman Sachs.
Suspicious mortgage bonds are so-called securities backed by a pool of mortgage loans.
They're backed by internal loans.
It was the fate of a number of financial companies when the US housing bubble burst in 2007.
The American investment bank Lehman Brothers ordered a long life in September 2008 on the brink of the financial crisis.
A few years later, banks in the United States are still struggling with the storm.
Investors and regulators have filed a large number of lawsuits demanding compensation or punishing fraudsters.
The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) is behind the biggest wave of claims .
It accuses 18 major international banks of having purchased from American lenders Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac mortgage agreements worth approximately $200 billion.
Deutsche Bank also faces the threat of prosecution by the FHFA over numerous agreements totaling $14.2 billion concluded between 2005 and 2007.
The regulator is demanding that the Frankfurt-based bank take responsibility for "substantial losses", but has not yet specified the exact amount.
Deutsche Bank dismissed the claims as unfounded and announced its intention to challenge them.
Warren Buffett is investing $10 billion in IBM .
Financial guru Buffett is actively investing in the IT company IBM.
Since March, he's bought over ten billion dollars' worth of stock.
So far, the largest American investor, Warren Buffett, has always said that he doesn't invest in computer and IT companies because their long-term development is difficult to predict.
However, IBM's annual report changed his mind about investing in the industry.
Buffett said he should have realized much earlier that IBM was primarily offering services and buying computer systems for other companies' IT departments.
In the financial world, Warren Buffett's investments were considered a chivalric gesture.
IBM, the IT industry veteran, has now been given the title "Sir IBM".
In an interview with the American business television channel CNBC, Buffett said that since March he has bought IBM shares for a total of $10.7 billion.
His investment holding company Berkshire Hathaway became one of the largest shareholders of IBM with a share of 5.5 percent.
Buffett said that even IBM didn't know he was involved until recently.
He praised the management for making profits even during the financial crisis.
"They did a great job", Buffett said, referring to the management strategy.
Much of IBM's time was focused on high-yield IT services like data centers.
The founder of the computer industry, which is now over 100 years old, also offers software and consulting services, as well as powerful computers for business.
Buffett has been avoiding tech companies so far.
He claimed he only invested in companies whose business he understood.
And invested in, for example, freight railroads, lubricants and engineering.
His holding company Berkshire Hathaway owns stakes in a long list of major companies such as Coca-Cola and Munich Re (formerly Münchener Rück), along with about 80 of its own subsidiaries.
The 81-year-old bought a small textile company, Berkshire Hathaway, in the 1960s and, with the help of skilled investments, built one of the world's most expensive companies on its foundation.
His lifestyle, however, remained modest.
Making him an icon for countless investors around the world.
His almost infallible money-making instinct earned him the nickname "Omaha Oracle".
IBM's stock price rose by one percent before the markets opened after Buffett's investment announcement.
The Blue Giant, also known as IBM, is listed on the stock exchange for over $220 billion, making it one of the most expensive high-tech companies in the world alongside Apple and Microsoft.
Buffett, however, has said he's not going to invest in Microsoft.
Its founder, Bill Gates, is a close friend of his.
The Imminent Danger
After the "Zwikka cell" was discovered, the Turkish media began to question the rule of law in Germany.
One of the newspapers is talking about a "bloody ideology" that is now resurfacing.
The murders of eight Turkish and one Greek businessman between 2000 and 2006 were the result of right-wing extremist ideology.
Fear and anxiety were the reaction to this message in Turkey and in the German-Turkish community in Germany.
For many Turks in Germany, this news has revived long-forgotten fears, and there have been no such right-wing extremist attacks on Turks since the fires in Melln in November 1992 and in Zolingen in May 1993.
Never doubted, however, that xenophobia exists in Germany.
However, the right-wing extremist network that has been discovered has a scale that is not yet fully understood.
"The revival of bloody ideology?" was the headline of the Turkish newspaper Haberturk's online version.
Sabah, on the other hand, notes that one of the perpetrators was a secret intelligence informant, and expresses concern that the German authorities may be caught up in the right-wing extremist swamp.
The Turkish Community in Germany (TGD) reacted calmly by commemorating the victims of racial hatred with a silent picket in front of the Brandenburg Gate this weekend.
Just two weeks ago, the Turkish community of Berlin celebrated the 50th anniversary of the German-Turkish bilateral agreement on the recruitment of labour at a ceremony attended by German and Turkish politicians.
Cooperation between the two countries was presented in a positive light - as a success story.
The coverage in some Turkish media was like a slap in the face. "German gift for the 50th anniversary" is the title of one of the articles on the Turkish web portal Haber X, which commented on the circumstances of the series of murders.
The German Hürriyet did not miss the opportunity to draw this parallel either.
"It's starting to smell bad" is the title of Ahmed Kullahi's column.
He notes that people who paid taxes and who contributed significantly to the transformation of Germany were killed.
The police's behavior and the subsequent successful raid were sharply criticized on German-Turkish internet forums.
The authors wondered why the German authorities had not thought of spying on suspected right-wing extremists earlier.
Some writers have come up with a rather harsh rhetoric: "If they continue to act in this way, migrants will have no choice but to defend themselves with weapons".
"This will be your best defense".
"The peace in Germany depends very much on how the whole network is unlocked and on the lawfulness of punishment", reports Selen.
The crimes in Melln and Zolingen in the 1990s were an example of how peace in Germany is threatened.
The photograph of the burned ruins in Zolingen was deeply imprinted in the memory of the Germans and Turks.
No other event has so clearly shown the Turks living here that they are in danger, and the Germans that distrust and indifference can turn into real violence.
These crimes, however, increased the sense of unity among the Turks.
Don 't repeat the mistakes of the past .
The Turkish press at the time condemned the German police's failure to respond to the attacks, and Helmut Kohl refused to visit the survivors in Melln.
He sent a telegram of condolence to the Turkish president after the arson in Zolingen, but the attendance at the memorial ceremony in Cologne was his foreign minister Klaus Kinkel - Kinkel in his speech counted the taxes that Turks pay in Germany,
It was as if he was measuring the value of a man by the taxes he paid.
The current coverage in the Turkish media has again shown how the distrust of many German Turks towards the current German state has deepened since then.
By making clear what needs to be done now in addition to efforts to identify and re-evaluate right-wing extremist terrorist organizations in Germany.
The bank scandal at Lake Zurich
Most of the risk-taking banks in Europe are not in France or Italy, but in Switzerland.
UBS almost went bankrupt during the financial crisis and has been battling one crisis after another ever since.
Now it's up to the German to get it back on track.
Alex Weber probably didn't know he was going to get the part.
In July, after his spectacular departure from the Federal Bank, it was announced that in 2013 he would take up an equally spectacular post as Chairman of the Board of Directors of the largest Swiss bank, UBS; an unexpected and lucrative career move.
Alex Weber was clearly enthusiastic, praising Switzerland for its beauty, UBS for its newfound strength, and made some friendly remarks to his future colleagues.
"UBS has managed to change for the better".
"I look forward to working with Caspar Filliger and Oswald Grubel".
But it was clear in September that things would be different.
A UBS trader in London bypassed the bank's security systems and lost about 1.7 billion euros.
The CEO of UBS, Oswald Gruebel, a banker known not only in Switzerland, had to leave.
Since then, the chairman of UBS has been considered ill, and everyone wants to know: When will Alex Weber finally take office?
Weber has been advising the bank since February 2012.
And, as the bank announced Tuesday, he will take over as chairman in May, not 2013.
This is not going to be easy for Alex Weber.
He's an economics professor and a central bank specialist, not a traditional banker, and he's bound to take some time to adjust.
He was suddenly responsible for the strategy of the bank, which once again proved that it had long since earned the title of "the biggest banking scandal in Europe".
UBS, on the one hand, is very big -- until recently it managed the largest assets in the world -- and on the other, it's been in a scandal for years.
It seems the proud Swiss bank is sparing nothing.
It all started during the financial crisis.
Until 2007, UBS had a great reputation.
The bank combined the image of a stealthy and stable, yet agile asset manager with ambitious goals and a desire to become the largest player in investment banking.
As a result, in 2007, UBS managed $1.6 billion, thus having more money in the hands of wealthy clients than any other bank in the world.
And as an investment bank, it's one of the biggest banks in the world.
That was impressive.
Hans Geiger, a former banker and professor of banking at the Institute of Banking at the University of Zurich, explains: "I always used UBS as a model for a good bank for my students".
"Knowing what we know now, you may ask, "How could I have been so wrong?"
He was really very wrong.
It wasn't until 2007 that it became clear that something was seriously wrong with UBS.
In the middle of the year, CEO Peter Woffley - who was considered a brilliant intellectual and equally brilliant banker - unexpectedly resigned.
A few months later, we were able to guess why he left.
The investment arm of the bank tried to play on substandard securities and was forced to write off billions.
Believe it or not, UBS has announced a capital increase of 13 billion Swiss francs to deal with the crisis.
The bank did manage to find investors -- but investors that many bankers would have politely turned down recently -- one very opaque Asian sovereign wealth fund from Singapore and one Arab sovereign wealth fund so secretive that it wasn't even named.
It was just the first blow.
In April 2008, things got much worse.
The bank had to announce new billions in losses, and the chairman of the board of directors Marcel Ospel - the second-highest-paid chairman of the board of directors in Switzerland in 2006 - resigned.
In October 2008, a disaster struck, and due to lack of investment during the financial crisis, UBS was facing the threat of collapse, and the state had to bail it out.
The National Bank bought toxic securities from UBS for an undisclosed amount of billions, and the Swiss Confederation paid six billion Swiss francs for a convertible bond with mandatory conversion to become co-owner of the bank.
The whole of Switzerland was in shock, the country realizing the dramatic consequences of the huge banks that had established themselves in a small country.
After all, the final balance sheet of UBS in 2007 was five times larger than the total production of Switzerland (see graph).
"We can't bail out UBS a second time", says banking analyst Geiger.
The second disaster came shortly after the first.
A few months later, UBS capitulated in a tax dispute with the United States and said it was willing to hand over the data of wealthy clients who may have evaded taxes through the bank.
UBS also agreed to pay $780 million, consisting of unjustified business income and fines.
UBS has thus more or less admitted that it was an instrument of tax evasion.
At the same time, UBS lost what had always been its advantage in the fight for wealthy clients, the veil of secrecy.
After that scandal, Swiss bank secrecy was not what it used to be.
The CEO and the chairman of the board have since resigned, and
The money of the customers began to run out.
In a matter of months, the bank lost confidence in both of its core areas of activity - investing due to failed speculation and managing assets as a result of aiding and abetting tax evasion.
And then it all calmed down and it seemed like UBS had managed to turn the tide, like this scammer-trader disaster, where one trader dropped 1.7 billion euros before the bank realized something was wrong.
One thing's for sure, risk management in investment isn't working yet.
"The Adoboli incident has clearly shown that risk controls have not changed enough", says Martin Janssen, professor of economics and finance at the Swiss Institute of Banking at the University of Zurich.
The chief financial officer of one of the largest German banks is equally confident: "The problem with UBS is that it lacks a tool to control risks".
It was prudence that for a long time made Swiss bankers custodians of the world's largest assets - not unnecessary risk, but safety for money, whether the world had collapsed outside the Alpine republic or not.
The Swiss bank vaults have become a symbol of unwavering reliability, as Lindt and Sprüngli symbolize the refined taste of chocolate.
The UBS headquarters in Zurich still resembles the image of a decent Swiss private bank, only slightly larger.
The layout is a classic in itself.
The bank's head office is located in Zurich on Banhofstrasse, which leads from the main station directly to Lake Zurich, surrounded by the snow caps of the Swiss mountains.
The buildings here are luxurious, and the rents for the shops are among the highest in Europe.
Among the traditional Swiss shops such as Confiserie Sprüngli, there are jewelry firms such as Tiffany's.
Swiss banks have been here for hundreds of years, from the National Bank to the Credit Suisse Palace to elite private banks like Julius Baer.
The heavy door leads to the UBS lobby.
Along the marble-covered walls are large leather sofas, and next to the bank's emblem is a large "Safe" sign.
UBS knows what their customers want, reliability.
But the two biggest Swiss banks, UBS and Credit Suisse, at some point abandoned the Swiss concepts of banking -- or, as the head of one of the smaller Swiss banks believes, betrayed them.
He wouldn't want his name in the paper - like all Swiss bankers, he's also in partnership with two of the biggest banks.
He believes that UBS has become too big - particularly in investment banking, where the Anglo-Saxons are very active.
He thinks the Swiss have nothing to add.
"And if anything, they've long since adapted to Anglo-Saxon customs".
It was the Anglo-Saxon investment banking that changed UBS, brought it its first big profits and then its failure, and no other financial institution in Europe lost as much money in the jungle of substandard assets as the largest Swiss bank.
The catastrophe became apparent on October 15, 2008.
"That Wednesday, the ruling coalition of a small country of seven million people launched the largest rescue operation in the country's history", writes Lucas Hassig in his book The UBS Crash.
Politicians approved the allocation of 68 billion Swiss francs (about 45 billion euros) to save the bank from bankruptcy.
How did this happen?
If you ask the Swiss banks, they'll say that the problem is mostly the size of UBS.
Two of the three largest Swiss banks merged into one large group in June 1998.
A bank was formed, which was already too big for small Switzerland at the time of the merger, and a bank that continued to grow.
It was also helped by the fact that the two banks that formed UBS were complementary: one was a wealthy but well-established bank specializing in asset management in Zurich; the other was not so wealthy but much more internationalised.
The internationalized investment bankers suddenly had access to a large amount of money that they could use to spin the all-powerful wheel.
Two names are associated with the growth of UBS: Peter Wolffley, the executive director of the UBS group from 2001 to 2007, and Marcel Ospel, chairman of the board of directors.
"I've always thought that Wolffley and Ospel were the dream team", says banking analyst Hans Geiger.
"Wulfley, a brilliant intellectual, modest and deeply knowledgeable about models and statistics, and Ospel, with his instinct, who has gone all the way up from a bank intern".
But Ospel eventually relied on Woolfley.
"He decided that his models were reality", Geiger says.
"This is tragic".
Maybe it was tragic.
Pride precedes defeat.
UBS employees remember well the board meetings where Woolffley always repeated the same slogan: "Move Goldman Sachs".
The American Bank was the most powerful investment bank in the world.
At the time, he was heading up the "tournament table", which was a record of the banks' successes.
UBS wanted to be at the top of the charts.
He was able to make some of that journey.
UBS was the largest player in the currency and government securities trading.
Authorized management consultants, however, pointed to a weakness: In terms of what is called "fixed income" in banking terminology, UBS was far behind the largest banks.
UBS had a failure in American mortgage products.
To close the hole, UBS embarked on an adventure that nearly cost him his life.
In an effort to grow, the bank and the hedge fund he founded invested in substandard U.S. securities.
It evolved into a large mechanism that consolidated securities based on American mortgages and sold them off -- still taking the risk.
Even when other banks had long been looking for a way out of the process, UBS did not stop.
"UBS bought until the summer of 2007, when the U.S. real estate market was already on fire", says banking analyst Geiger.
The higher the rise, the deeper the fall.
One manager after another had to leave as the efforts to get the bank in order proved to be more difficult than it had initially seemed.
The UBS posts became a child's play with chairs and remain unreliable to this day.
Anyone who leads this huge bank faces a near-impossible challenge.
He has to find a strategy for a bank that has turned its back on all existing business models.
Banking analyst Geiger already has an idea to give up investment banking, focus on asset management and forget about his Swiss roots.
The bank, however, is not (yet) ready to go that far.
However, it is clear that investment activity needs to be substantially increased.
The new head of the bank, Sergio Ermotti, plans to present his future strategy on Tuesday.
The 51-year-old Italian-Swiss banker was actually only seen as a temporary solution when the bank unexpectedly parted ways with his predecessor Grubel.
He has shown some character over the years and is now, as the Zurich bank said Tuesday, heading UBS on a permanent basis.

Recession fears in Europe are pulling down the American stock market
The looming recession in Europe has weakened the mood of American investors earlier this week.
The change of government in Athens and Rome had little effect.
The decline in industrial production on the continent has dampened hopes that the debt crisis could be overcome in the womb.
The general relief that followed the changes of government in Rome and Athens was not reinforced.
The euro has fallen against the dollar.
Last week, the Italian and Greek glasses were still considered half-full instead of half-empty - but now the problems are coming to the fore again, said Mark Luschini of Janney Mongomery Scott.
Financial exchanges, in particular, were in the sales lists.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed at 12,078 with a 0.6 percent drop.
The market barometer during the auction fluctuated between 12,027 and 12,170 points.

In Frankfurt, Dax fell 1.2 percent, closing at 5,985 points.
Industry in the 17 euro area countries has significantly reduced production and is adjusting to the end of growth.
Eurostat statistics reported that in September, companies produced two percent less than in the previous month.
"We're not on an island. We're dependent on them", said Steve Goldman of Goldman Management.
He also said that Europe was unlikely to shake off the recession quickly and that banks were showing further signs of weakness.
Legendary investor Warren Buffett has only been able to confirm these fears, saying in an interview with CNBC that it is still unclear whether Europe is strong enough to do what is needed to end the crisis.
So he thinks it's too early to invest in European government bonds or banks.
Instead, Buffett threw away a decades-old principle and invested in American high-tech industries.
His investments in IBM, totaling more than ten billion dollars, have raised the stock price of the oldest company by almost one percent against the trend.
The stock closed almost unchanged at $187.35.

Clever crows fill the cities
Graches are considered problem birds in many places, and experts today say that these highly intelligent birds will never be driven out of cities.
Some people love birds, others want to get rid of them as soon as possible. Crows have been part of the urban landscape for centuries, but residents are increasingly complaining about dirt and noise in many settlements.
The solution to the bird problem, however, is far from being achieved.
At the first symposium on crows, held in the city of Lér in East Frisia, experts argued that it was no longer possible to drive crows out of cities.
Experts from all over Germany discussed possible solutions.
Searching for alternatives in cities
Conservatives argued that the root of the problem in cities was the migration of the heavily protected grapefruit, pointing out that the use of chemicals in agriculture was increasingly destroying traditional habitat areas.
Hunting, expanding construction, and the cutting down of traditional nesting trees made life difficult for the birds.
The crows are under guard.
In the town of Zest in Westphalia and in the northwest in Yever, Dipholz, Achim near Bremen and Lere there are large colonies, numbering more than 600 parent pairs.
The ambiguous project of shooting crows in Ler caused unfavorable headlines in 2005.
Critics described trapping birds and beating them with sticks as particularly cruel.
"Simple displacement and intimidation are useless", said architect and landscape designer Werner Klever of Ler.
Water-flowing nests or tree-cutting often have unwanted consequences, said Manfred Kaiser, an environmental expert in Lara, Baden-Württemberg.
"The animals are scattered, and the large colonies are divided and spread to other areas".
Scaring is only possible in the exceptional case near hospitals, nursing homes and schools.
"We're going to have to live with them. Getting rid of them is not an option".
The problem in cities will not be solved by separating them from the surrounding areas, says Lera mayor Wolfgang Kellner.
A combination of scaring the birds away from areas in need of protection and encouraging them to return to other areas could be the solution.
"Information stands instead of gas stations" was the slogan proposed by psychologist and ethnologist Uta Maria Jurgens, who advocates a completely different approach to birds. "We have to be confident in ourselves to live with this problem".
Jurgens was one of the founders of the educational raven route in Asherberg in Schleswig-Holstein, where information about the lives of highly intelligent people is given on information stands.
The project is already attracting tourists.
Jurgens also expressed her opinion about complaints about noise from birds: "Noise is a lot of information, and they have a lot to say to each other".
The wisdom and dexterity of these birds have become legendary, and the Grachi often use tools to take a piece of their own, but they also make tools themselves.
Behavioral researchers at the University of Cambridge recently tested the measurement of bird intelligence on four grains.
In one experiment, the birds quickly learned that they had to knock on a board to get a mole larva.
Without much training, they could figure out the size and shape of the stone needed to knock down the plank.
In another experiment, the smart ones had to solve a more complex problem.
The researchers placed a small bucket of mole larvae in a vertical cylinder.
Birds couldn't reach their prey with their beaks.
But the researchers gave them pieces of wire.
All four birds used the wire to make hooks and used the hooks to grip the bucket by the handle and pull it out of the cylinder.
Three of the four greys did it on their first try.
Ronaldo leads Portugal to the Euro 2012
The hopes of the Bosniaks and Turks for victory at the last minute were long gone.
The favourites Portugal, Croatia and the Czech Republic, plus Ireland, will compete in the 2012 European Championship.
Portugal, the Czech Republic, Croatia and Ireland finished last in the Euro 2012 championship in Poland and Ukraine.
Led by superstar Cristiano Ronaldo, who scored in the 8th and 53rd minutes, Portugal beat Bosnia and Herzegovina 6:2 (2:1), perfecting their fifth European Championship appearance after a 0-0 draw in the first leg.
Chechens had enough 1:0 (0:0) in the second round of the playoffs against the outsider Montenegro after a clean victory in the first round (2:0).

Nani (24th minute), Nelder Postiga (72nd and 82nd) and Miguel Veloso (80th) scored the remaining goals for Portugal.

The former Wolfsburg player from English Championship leader Manchester City sent the ball headlong into the lower end of the bar at the 33rd minute, but the ball did not cross the goal line.
Yiracek scores for the Czech Republic
Then the spotlight was on Judge Wolfgang Stark of Ergolding .
Following Elder Postig's attack on the Bosnian penalty spot in the 36th minute, Starck decided that the Portuguese player was faking, and showed him the yellow card.
Stark also awarded a dubious penalty for the hand play after Fabio Quentran's foul - Misimovich executed it.
After the break, the 2004 European vice-champions consolidated the score with four more goals.
Peter Yiracek cleared all remaining doubts about the Czechs in the 81st minute.
The 1976 European champions are going to the European championship for the fifth time in a row.
Luck also smiled on coach Michael Bilek's team and Bundesliga legionnaires Michael Kadletz (Bayer Leverkusen) and Thomas Peckhart (1st FC Nuremberg) after a mistake at the very beginning that could have been catastrophic.
Goalkeeper Petr Čech in the 9th minute, thanks to an instant reflex, prevented a potential self-goal by Tomáš Sivok.

Damianovich hit from the edge of the penalty area in the 40th minute and almost scored for Chek.
After the break, she saved the already battered world-class goalkeeper Chek after the forward of FC Seoul left the field in the 50th minute.
The winning goal was scored just before the final whistle.
Turkey, meanwhile, lacked football happiness in Zagreb.
Four days after losing 0-3 in Istanbul, the Turks couldn't play any better than a 0-0 draw in Zagreb.
Although there is now almost no doubt that national coach Gus Hiddink will now make a place on the bench of the team that finished third in 2002, the Croatians are in the final round of the European championship for the fourth time.
The Turks managed to get off to a nearly perfect start in front of 31,000 spectators at the Maxim Stadium.
Seljuk Inan's long shot in the seventh minute hit the goal, and forward Kazym Kazym failed to get the ball into the net.
Croatia woke up and took control of the game.
After the break, the Croats continued the game in excellent form.
Bundesliga legends Daniel Pranitch (Bavaria, Munich) and Gordon Shildenfeld (Ayntracht, Frankfurt) were on the field along with Mario Mandzukic from Wolfsburg, who lost his place to Ivan Perišić from Dortmund in the 62nd minute.
Trapattoni is going to Euro 2012.
The Irish in Dublin were celebrating their first Euro since Germany in 1988.
Coach Giovanni Trapattoni's team - which already looked confident in its place after a 4-0 win in the first leg - took the lead in the 32nd minute thanks to a goal from Steven Ward.
Konstantin Vasilyev from the guest team tied the score in the 57th minute.
Ireland had a good start, but it was not until the 23rd minute that Los Angeles' Robbie Keane made his first clean break.
At the last minute, the Estonian defender managed to keep him from taking Ireland forward.
The goal was scored in the 32nd minute.
Bypassing goalkeeper Paul Londack's defence, Ward found himself in the right spot and, by passing the ball over the line, changed the score to 1-0.

SAP plans to double the number of employees in China
Europe's largest software maker, SAP, plans to invest billions and almost double its workforce in China in the next few years.
The Dax-listed company said Thursday it plans to invest about $2 billion (about 1.5 billion euros) by 2015.
"We will create more R&D opportunities and employ thousands of people", said Bill McDermott, one of SAP's executive directors, in a statement at a consumer expo in Beijing.
The staff of 2,500 should grow to 4,500.
The world leader in industrial software plans to double the number of its offices from five to ten or eleven.
SAP now has offices in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Chengdu and Dalian.
In this booming country, there are about 4,000 SAP customers out of over 176,000 worldwide.
The growth forecast for China is an important component of the Dax-listed company's 2015 strategy.

"Now we want to change the scale of our operations", said McDermott.
"Our goal is to achieve sustainable growth by relying on information in China".
Mass murder is a human dimension.
Peter Englund's tense and very good new book, Beauty and Sorrow: A Personal History of the First World War, begins with a long list of characters that makes your heart stop.
Here's a tip for reading on: Cut this page carefully and use it as a bookmark.
You will get to know these people very closely as Mr. Englund narrates, and this list of actors will be your GPS, your beacon in those moments when, like one of these men and women, you stray off the road and get lost in the fog of war.
Mr. Englund is a Swedish historian and journalist.
He is also the new permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy, which awards the Nobel Prize in Literature.
The book he's writing now is unusual, he describes it, quite accurately, as "a work on anti-history".
It has few famous names, important treaties, or famous battles; it has almost no ambassadors, clever journalists, or discussions of tactics and military technology.
It is not so much a book about what happened", he explains, "as it is a book about what it was like. It is about "feelings, impressions, experiences and states of mind".
"Beauty and Sorrow" weaves together the experiences of 20 more or less insignificant men and women from both sides of the front lines, from schoolgirls and botanists to climbers, doctors, ambulance drivers and civil servants.
Some of these people are gonna be heroes.
Someone will be captured, lose an arm or a leg, go mad or die.
Their lives here are like church candles, with new ones added to the many others, and some going out at the same time.
Mr. Englund's book is a departure from the standard of historical books.
This is a correction to the idea that World War I was only a heavy trench war on the Western Front.
"Beauty and Sorrow" skillfully gives a panorama of other theaters of war: the Alps, the Balkans, the Eastern Front, Mesopotamia, East Africa.
The soldiers in this book are being attacked by bee hives; one of them is celebrating Christmas in Egypt under the pyramids; the unsolved problem is the flies.
It's a very exciting book, almost from the beginning.
War is sweeping over these people's lives like a natural disaster, like Hurricane Katrina smelling like smokeless powder.
When you hear a cannonball in the distance and you're a woman and you're home with the kids, do you stay or do you run?
Anyway, who's next?
Almost no one understands what's going on or why we have to fight this war.
"The lack of facts", observes Mr. Englund, "is filled with guesswork, speculation, hope, fear, obsessive ideas, conspiracy theories, dreams, nightmares and rumors".
"Beauty and Sorrow" follows the fates of people like Florence Farmborough, an English nurse in the Russian army, and Richard Stumpf, a young sailor in the German High Seas Fleet.
Their stories are drawn mostly from memoirs, letters, and other published material.
The stories of their lives may be frightening or exciting, but they are most alive thanks to the small moments and fragments collected by Mr. Englund.
A lot of it is about deprivation and how to deal with it.
He tells the story of a German schoolgirl, and he says, "Erz, Erz everywhere".
"Fake coffee, fake aluminum, fake rubber, paper bandages, wooden buttons". What are you doing here?
He keeps talking about Erzac food in Germany.
He describes "meat made from pressed rice boiled in lamb's fat (and decorated with a false bone made of wood); tobacco made from dried roots and dried potato skins; shoes beaten with wood".
He notes that there were "837 registered meat substitutes permitted in the production of sausages, 511 registered coffee substitutes".
Some stories are about honor and courage.
One American observes the urge for cruelty in himself and says of war: "You feel that, after all, that is what men were made for, not to sit in comfortable chairs with cigarettes and whiskey, the evening paper or the best-seller and claim that this show is civilization and that under your stuffed shirt with padding is not a barbarian".
The British soldier, on the other hand, notices that he is likely to die and no one will notice or be upset.
"When a person accepts the idea of self-sacrifice, he would like to think that it would be done in public", he writes.
But it's a lot like "a condemned man being hanged in secret".
Other comments are about the old Europe falling apart and about new kinds of fear.
"Conflict became more and more an economic contest", writes Mr. Englund, "a war of the factories".
He notes the arrival of what he calls "a new face in the bestiary of the new century: a beautifully expressive and ideologically convinced mass murderer in a well-sewn suit who arranges the slaughter at his desk".
People act in unpredictable ways: lowly acts as much as heroism.
Mr. Englund told of soldiers who tried to get venereal disease from prostitutes to avoid serving at the front.
"The most grotesque expression of this can be seen in the trade in gonorrhea dung, which soldiers bought and smeared on their genitals in the hope of getting into a hospital", he writes.
"The desperate rubbed it in his eyes, often leading to lifelong blindness".
Translated from the Swedish by Peter Graves, Mr. Englund's prose is flexible but unpretentious, perfectly suited to his humanistic task.
In dozens of small scenes, he shows how the war "unleashed forces that were completely uncontrollable: extreme nationalism, social revolution, religious hatred".
People start asking why their leaders make them go to war.
The best books about World War I were often indirect, like Paul Fassel's The Great War and Modern Memory or such novels as Erich-Maria Remarque's On the Western Front Without Change, rather than exhaustive historical works.
Mr. Englund's book is part of this unusual pantheon.
His book has the most stunning ending I can remember in nonfiction.
I'm not going to tell him.
But it's like he reached out from a book to a page with a list of characters, grabbed it out of your hands and set it on fire with a match.
After the previous mistake , a carefully calculated raid .
Hundreds of police officers were involved in the operation, some wearing protective helmets.
The night time from Monday to Tuesday was chosen because it was the least crowded time in Zuccotti Park.
The operation was kept secret from everyone except a few high-ranking officers, who were told at first that they were going to train.
Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly was at the center of the action, his presence underscoring the importance of the police department's operations.
There was no question of repeating the events of the past few weeks, such as the use of mercury gas against protesters, which was against departmental rules and caused a storm of public sympathy for the occupiers.
So after two weeks of planning and training, the police operation to free Zuccotti Park from the protesters began.
The authorities prepared by watching the occupation unfold in other cities.
The largest anti-crisis exercises were conducted on Randall's Island with the Zuccotti in mind.
Authorities have increased the number of so-called riot drills - counterterrorism measures that involve rapidly moving large numbers of police - in reference to Lower Manhattan.
The last training was Monday night on the Manhattan side of the East River.
The order to enter the park came at "last minute", said a source familiar with the orders, which referred to the mission as "training".
"The few cops I know who were called in on this case didn't tell me they were being sent to Zuccotti Park", said the person, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
"The only people who knew they were going to Zookeeper Park were the highest-ranking people in the department".
Part of the reason for the secrecy was the lesson the city learned.
On October 14, authorities wanted to clear the park, but backed down to hundreds of protesters who rushed in ahead of schedule after hearing about the plans.
The operation on Tuesday involved officers from various police units, including county forces - police teams that were usually used to control the criminal neighborhoods.
Mr. Kelly said that many people, almost as if they were working, come and go from the park during the day, making 1 a.m. a good time to attack.
"It was the right thing to do when there were the fewest people in the park", he said.
Emergency vehicles with flashlights and loudspeakers, assembled at Pike Slip and Franklin Roosevelt Drive, near the Manhattan Bridge, before moving forward.
The floodlights and pre-recorded announcements carried by loudspeakers seem to have frightened many protesters.
When the officers of the administrative units entered the park in their blue windshields, many protesters simply packed their things and left.
Police said the tents were not touched until 1:45 p.m., giving protesters time to pack their things.
Other groups of police, according to eyewitnesses, were gathering around the perimeter to enter in case arrests were needed in the park.
The journalists in the park were forced to leave.
Paul J. Brown, spokesman for the chief of the police department, said it was done for their safety.
But many journalists claim they were not allowed to see the police and that the police treated them harshly.
Mr. Brown said that the cars with the cameras on Church Street, along the western boundary of the park, could have taken the picture.
As police passed west through a pile of protesters' personal belongings, including bags, plastic carpets and plastic bags, full of clothes, Sanitation Department teams followed, collecting what was thrown away.
Some protesters who refused to leave were dragged outside, and pictures of this soon surfaced on the Internet.
The main group of protesters took up positions near the camp kitchen, in the center of the park.
Some set up barricades, and the police came in, methodically arresting them.
About 10 people in the center of the camp tied themselves together by the hands.
And two men chained themselves to trees, Mr. Kelly said.
Rescue crews were called in to cut the locks.
No arrests were made in the park until about 3:30 a.m., Mr. Kelly said.
The cleanup operation was completed in about 75 minutes, police said.
Mr. Brown said that approximately 142 people were arrested in the park.
Most were arrested for "disturbing public order and resisting arrest", he said.
The highest-ranking officer on the scene was Joseph J. Esposito, the head of the department and the senior officer in the department.
Phil T. Pulaski, the head of the department's intelligence police, was there, too.
Mr. Kelly, although present, "did not direct the operation", Mr. Brown said.
A second group of officers was standing by along the east side of Broadway, between Liberty Street and Cedar Street, in case we needed to get inside.
Barricades were placed on Cortland Street, a block north of the park, and on Pine Street, a block south.
Observers saw the police from these positions extend the perimeter even beyond the borders of Zuccotti Park.
At one point, observers saw a group of police officers, many with shields, pushing people even further away.
About 28 people were on the northern perimeter.
Some of the most serious events of the night occurred south of the park.
Around 5 a.m. south of Pine Street, one of the protesters jumped onto the roof of a police car, while others, witnesses said, blew air out of the tires of a police van.
At some point, a piece of plywood flew out of the crowd.
As a result, one police officer and one of the protesters were hospitalized.
The school service personnel union is suing the city for dismissal
The union, which represents hundreds of school maintenance workers who lost their jobs last month, plans to sue the city on Wednesday, arguing that the layoffs were unnecessary and discriminatory because of the disproportionate impact on schools where poor students attend.
A lawsuit is probably the last resort available to the 37th District Council's union trying to get the layoffs reversed.
The 672 school assistants, parent-work coordinators and other employees, who were among the lowest paid workers in the city, lost their jobs on October 7 as a result of what union leaders called a political reaction to their refusal to give the city access to worker-run health funds to fill a budget gap last spring.
City officials have categorically denied the accusation.
At a City Council hearing last month, school chancellor Dennis M. Walcott said the layoffs were part of a budget they signed in June.
One board member countered by telling him that there was no indication in the budget that the school's support staff would be fired.
Representatives of the 37th District Council said they had filed a notice of complaint, alerting the Department of Education that a lawsuit had been filed against it; a press conference will be held Wednesday to announce the formal filing of the lawsuit with the state Supreme Court in Manhattan.
The lawsuit will name Mr. Walcott and the city's Department of Education as defendants and list eight temporarily dismissed employees as plaintiffs, all of whom are black or Hispanic women, as well as most of the assistants who lost their jobs.
Elizabeth Thomas, a spokeswoman for the city's legal department, said the city had not seen the lawsuit and therefore could not comment on its specific provisions.
According to a preliminary version of the complaint obtained by the New York Times, the union focused on a number of school layoffs in poor neighborhoods of the city to support a claim of unfair treatment, arguing that poor schools lost more assistants because they are chronically underfunded.
He points out that while there were no layoffs in Staten Island, and there were few in the Upper East Side or Tribeca schools, 17 school assistants lost jobs in District 23 in Brownsville, Brooklyn, and 46 had to leave in Districts 8 and 9 in the South Bronx.
Noting the loss of five of the eight school assistants working at Free High School 36 in Harlem, where 68 percent of students live in poverty, the lawsuit says: "These are not neighborhoods of wealthy parents who can find money to fill the budget gaps".
P.S. The 36th was cut 3.26 percent this year, and it also lost money when the city changed the way it calculated the extra funding for each poor student who went to school.
The union also claims that school principals may have been misled by the language of the notice allowing the dismissal of parent coordinators.
The notice used the word "excess", although "excess" is more commonly used when a teacher is moved from the school payroll to the list of available employees whose salaries are paid by the central office.
"Sixty-six parents' coordinators were fired", the lawsuit states, "not simply transferred".
Mission accomplished, Congress ready to agree on Libya.
It seems that the Republicans and Democrats on Capitol Hill are finally ready to agree on something relevant to the uprising in Libya.
All it took was for the rebellion to succeed, longtime dictator Muammar Gaddafi to be captured and killed, and the American intervention to end.
On Tuesday, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee is due to consider a resolution put forward by Chairman John Kerry (D-Massachusetts) along with Senators John McCain (R-Arizona) and Joseph E. Lieberman (R-Connecticut), which praises the Libyans for their successful uprising and the U.S. troops for their "courage".
"The purpose of this resolution is to honor the brave people of Libya as they begin to rebuild their country", Kerry said.
"It is a confirmation of their democratic aspirations from both parties".
Language may seem harmless, but no discussion of Libya has ever been easy.
This summer, lawmakers from both parties have been arguing with each other and the White House over the wording of a series of resolutions approving or condemning the role of the US military in the NATO mission in Libya.
In June, Kerry and McCain introduced a resolution allowing for limited use of American armed forces in Libya.
The bill was rejected by the House of Representatives by a large majority of both parties and never made it to a vote in the Senate.
But on the same day that the bill failed in the House of Representatives, the House also failed to support a proposal that would cut funding for the U.S. operation in Libya.
It left the American mission in a kind of legislative purgatory, where Congress is angry enough to criticize Obama's approach to the mission, but not angry enough to actually kick the ground out of its feet.
Then events overtook the indecision of Congress.
In August, Tripoli surrendered to Libyan rebels, and on October 20, Gaddafi was killed.
The NATO mission officially ended on October 31.
Now the Senate can be ready to act.
The Foreign Affairs Committee resolution "admires the Libyan people for their incredible courage and extraordinary resilience in the pursuit of freedom" and thanks the men and women of the United States Armed Forces and their coalition partners who participated in the military operation to protect the Libyan people for their extraordinary courage and professionalism".
The resolution also "affirms the national interest of the United States in a successful and irreversible transition to democracy in Libya".
Will the new measures get the full support of the Foreign Affairs Council or will they divide lawmakers like the June bill?
The last version was opposed by Senator Richard G. Luger, the Republican leader on the Committee.
Luger's representative said Monday that he hasn't seen the final version of the bill yet.
On the other side of the Capitol, the House of Representatives is due to vote this week on a constitutional amendment requiring a balanced budget, a top legislative priority for almost every Republican and for some Democrats in Congress.
This measure, proposed by House Rep. Bob Goodlat, R-V., will be the first constitutional amendment on a budget or anything else to be put to a plenary vote in this session of Congress.
Other lawmakers have so far failed to bring their amendments to the plenary, but not because they haven't tried.
The Goodlat amendment is just one of 68 constitutional amendments that touched on a wide range of issues that were introduced in this convocation.
Some were duplicate - the same bill was introduced in the House of Representatives and the Senate - others were minor variations of each other.
There are at least 15 versions of the balanced budget amendments in the House alone and a few more on "control over federal spending".
Some of them are identical, too, but they give their authors - mostly newly elected Republicans who want to embellish their resumes - a chance to brag that they "proposed" such a proposal.
The Budget Control Act, passed in August, required both the House of Representatives and the Senate to vote for a balanced budget amendment.
In March, 58 senators voted for a non-binding resolution supporting the idea of such an amendment.
In addition to the budget, some congressmen want to limit the number of terms of office for members of Congress, and House member Jose Serrano (Democrat, New York) wants to abolish the two-term limit for the president.
Congressman Jesse L. Jackson Jr. (Democrat, Illinois) proposed a number of amendments that would guarantee, among other things, the right to quality education and health care.
The amendment banning same-sex marriage has been proposed for years, as has another one banning burning the flag.
Some lawmakers also want to allow the repeal of federal laws if two-thirds of the states object.
As much as members of Congress have tried to propose amendments, they're not moving any faster than in previous years.
In the 111th Congress, lawmakers proposed 77 such amendments, and in the 110th, they introduced 66.
That's a far cry from the early 1990s, when members of Congress, according to the Senate Library, regularly proposed more than 150 amendments every two years.
But they didn't have any more success than they do now.
The last amendment that was passed, the 27th, was passed in 1992, but it was actually introduced in Congress in 1789.
"Beaten, but not defeated", Giffords says in her first television interview since the assassination
Ten months after a gunman shot her in the head at a public event in Tucson, House of Representatives member Gabrielle Giffords (D-Arizona) appeared on the Federal Channel Monday night, singing a tune from the Broadway show "The Sun Will Come Back Tomorrow", and said she wanted to get better more than return to Congress.
After appearing on ABC News's "20/20" with Diana Sawyer, Giffords struggled to formulate sentences and needed help with her walking.
The program showed her the difficult path of recovery from a gunshot wound that shattered her skull and pierced the left side of her brain, going from the front to the back of her head.
Three months later, she unexpectedly returned to the House of Representatives and voted triumphantly on the bill to limit the debt.
In her first television interview since the January shooting, in which six people were killed and 13 injured, Giffords smiled, laughed and sang - and called her recovery "difficult".
When Sawyer asked how she was feeling, 41-year-old Giffords said, "Very well".
The interview with Giffords and her husband, astronaut Mark Kelly, was part of an hour-long special, "20/20", which aired on the eve of the release of the couple's new book, "Gabby: A Story of Courage and Hope".
The special covered Giffords' recovery after the Jan. 8 shooting.
In the video Kelly took in the first few weeks, she's lying in a hospital bed with a shaved head and a long scar on her forehead.
She can only lift one or two fingers at the request of her husband.
A few months later, we see Giffords in a wheelchair, and the physical therapists are teaching her how to do simple movements.
Shake your head.
Open your lips.
And then her first word was, "What".
A few days later, Giffords uttered the second word, "toast", a request to change the breakfast menu.
The video shown by ABC demonstrates that music played a central role in Giffords' recovery: we see the congressman singing along with doctors to Cindy Lauper's "Girls Just Want to Have Fun" and Tom Petty's "Free Fall".
In an interview, Sawyer Giffords, who spends two hours a day on the procedure, said she doesn't remember the day of the assassination.
Her husband said he was reading Giffords' newspaper article about the March 12 shooting when she stopped him to ask for the first time about the six who were killed that day.
Suspected assailant Jared Lee Laffner is being held at the Missouri State Penitentiary and is undergoing forced treatment pending trial.
"Many people died", said Giffords Sawyer.
"Heavy, heavy, heavy". That's what I said.
One day during her recovery, Kelly Sawyer said, she said, "I'm defeated".
"And I said, 'Gabby, you're not defeated,'" Kelly said.
You're just being beaten.
And you're gonna get through this, you're gonna get better, and you're gonna come back stronger than ever.
The troops feel more pity than respect.
The event was a Wall Street celebration that raised millions of dollars for homeless veterans in New York City.
Kid Rock sang a ballad about helplessness, disappointment and loss.
At the signal, several hundred soldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines lined up around him.
The audience in tuxedos applauded him standing up.
"The soldiers were treated like heroes", said David Salzman, who organized the spring fundraiser.
The senior military officer at the concert, who was also the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff at the time, Admiral Mike Mullen, saw the role of the troops differently.
"They were treated like orphans", the officer wrote in an e-mail.
I'm sure the organizers wanted it the best way.
I know that.
But it wasn't really respect.
The very opposite impression illustrates the difficult relationship that has developed between the military and the often indifferent, sometimes admired American public.
The troops are wasting praise for their sacrifices.
But praise comes at a price, say the military.
The public is increasingly acting as if they're feeling sorry for people in uniform.
"We are not victims at all", said Brigadier General Sean B. McFarland, who commanded troops in Iraq and is soon to leave for Afghanistan.
"But it seems the only way for some to show support is to treat us like miserable".
This is a sensitive topic for military leaders who don't want to appear ungrateful or disagreeable to the society they serve.
They also realize that the anger that returned troops faced in the final years of the Vietnam War was far worse.
As a result, most of the talk about pity is quiet and only between war veterans.
After his two sons returned from combat in the Marines, retired Colonel Mark Kenshn warned them that people outside the military would view their service from two points of view.
Some will look up to them with admiration because they've crushed the rebels and been to exotic places.
Others will wonder if there is "a cruel, evil veteran in disguise", said Kenshun, who fought in Iraq and returned to a high government position in Washington.
While looking for a job, he says, he felt that some interviewers were cautiously asking whether he could handle the stress of a responsible job in Washington, D.C., right after the war.
Kenshun recalls telling his sons: "When you talk about your ministry, you should expect a negative effect".
The embarrassment the military is experiencing is partly due to America's indifference to war.
Victory on the battlefield is rarely praised by a country that has little familiarity with the military and sees little direct benefit from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.
"We as a nation no longer value military heroism the way it was absolutely normal in World War II", says retired Lieutenant General David Barnow, who commanded U.S. forces in Afghanistan.
Instead, the admiration of politicians and the public is mostly focused on the depth of the soldier's suffering.
Troops are judged by the number of campaigns they've made, by the number of comrades they've lost, or by the scale of the losses.
The Army Faces Increasing Pressure From Supporters of Rape
This week, a historic court hearing is set to decide whether to accept the lawsuit filed by 28 men and women against the military for failure to prevent rape.
If not, hundreds of plaintiffs will line up for the next one.
First-class private Elizabeth Lyman is 25 and 11 weeks pregnant, and she claims she was raped by her fellow officer at night.
It was October 2008, she was returning to her barracks at Miramar Airfield, north of San Diego, after dinner with a friend, and she met a male colleague carrying a package of 12 bottles of beer.
He asked if he could come in her room for a drink.
"It was a red flag", Lyman says.
But the Texas native has expressed her concerns.
I thought, no, he's 19.
"He's from Texas", she said.
"I wish I hadn't listened to my instincts".
Minutes after they entered Lyman's room, the man approached her from behind, knocked her down and raped her, she claims.
This week, November 18, Lyman and 27 other current and former military personnel will be anxiously awaiting the court's decision at a historic hearing in Arlington, Virginia, that will decide whether to go to trial the lawsuit they filed against former Secretary of Defense Robert Gates and his predecessor Donald Russelfield.
The lawsuit alleges that Gates and Rumsfeld failed to address widespread violence in the military in violation of the constitutional rights of soldiers.
The lawsuit, filed in February by Washington, D.C. attorney Susan Burke, originally included 17 plaintiffs, but grew to 28 in the following months - 25 women and three men, all of whom allege that they were raped or threatened with sexual violence by fellow service members and that the military failed to properly investigate, prosecute or provide proper justice after the alleged attacks.
Burke says she's targeting the top ranks of the military because the problem starts with them.
"The army is a vertical structure", she says.
"Who are the people who can exterminate the cult of violence?
Burke also says that she has been contacted by about 400 other victims since February, many of whom may be involved in future lawsuits.
Her strategy: instead of putting all the plaintiffs in this case together, putting all the eggs in one basket, so to speak, she'll open a lot of cases if necessary to keep the pressure on.
A defense team from the Department of Defense led by U.S. Attorney Neal McBride has taken steps to close the case.
The court documents obtained by Newsweek reveal a defense strategy - basically that former or current soldiers cannot sue the army for damages suffered in the armed forces.
Under the doctrine, referred to in the Supreme Court's 1950 decision as the Feres Doctrine, the federal government is not responsible for damage caused by persons in military service.
"The alleged damage relates to the risk inherent in the plaintiffs' military service", the documents state.
The Department of Defense declined to comment on the story.
Things have changed since the '50s.
Although women are still officially banned from fighting, this division exists only in words: modern wars rarely have a clear front line.
In both Iraq and Afghanistan, women's military teams are playing an increasingly important role, especially in contact with local women in the war zone.
The result: In the period between the two wars, 150 women soldiers were killed - two-thirds of them in combat.
It's time for the military to get modern, too, Burke says.
She is not alone in her struggle; in addition to her quest, three others are preparing.
At Yale Law School, the Veterans Legal Service Seminar is preparing a lawsuit against four major military academies for allegedly promoting a misogynistic atmosphere.
A separate nonprofit, the American Veterans of Vietnam, is suing the military, focusing on diagnoses of "personality changes" that are made to victims of violence to remove them from service, a common occurrence, according to activists such as Anu Bhaggwati of the rights group Women-Military Action Organization.
Her group filed a lawsuit in December against the Department of Veterans Affairs, accusing it of discriminatory practices in processing pension applications from people who claim to have been threatened with sexual violence while on duty.
Nine separate bills proposing a number of measures were introduced in Congress by a group of senators and members of the House of Representatives from both parties.
In 2010, according to the Department of Defense's Sexual Assault Prevention and Combating Service, 3,158 attempted rapes were reported.
But, as we know, the attacks are often not reported, and the Pentagon's own estimates put the number at about 13.5 percent of the estimated 19,000 attacks that year.
The report, published in March, also examines the percentage of cases that went to trial: In 2010, 20 percent of known cases went to trial - twice as many as in the civil justice system.
The plaintiffs in Burke's case are calling the assaults on them just the first in a series of other injuries.
In Lyman's case, she reported the rape to the military police less than an hour after it happened.
That night, she says, she was asked to give the details of the rape 11 separate times to a string of police, doctors and commanders.
She collected a set of rape evidence, and the assailant's blood - from a cut on her arm - was found on her bed.
Six months later, in April 2009, Lyman sat before a judge at a hearing where she was asked if she had had sex with her boyfriend earlier on the day of the attack.
Six people gave a positive evaluation of the defendant, who was ultimately acquitted.
"I remember the day the verdict was read", Lyman says.
"I thought I was having a baby, and I ran out of the courtroom screaming".
"They put me in a psychiatric ward, and when I came out, I remember my commanding officer saying, 'This wasn't a trial on him. This was a trial on me.'"
Lyman was ordered to see a military psychiatrist, who eventually diagnosed her with a personality disorder that made her unfit for service.
In January 2010, she was dismissed with unfavorable wording, which prevented her from receiving any benefits.
Whether Lyman and her lawsuit colleagues will move forward is a difficult question, says John Turley, a professor of law at George Washington University Law School.
However, he notes: "I think they are able to move forward".
Between them and the verdict is a doctrine that has been criticized since it was first introduced.
I've been critical of the Ferris Doctrine my whole life.
The military has lagged behind for decades because it lacks the incentives and deterrents that impose responsibility.
He adds: "The odds are pretty much against them . . . but it's important for them to try".
These things will only change when decent people are willing to fight.
If the hearing doesn't go to their advantage, Burke, the plaintiffs' attorney, will recruit hundreds of other plaintiffs for future cases.
"We will continue to fight the army on this issue until there is a reform", she says.
Or until we die, whichever comes first.
Walls have eyes: How researchers study you on Facebook
Before he became the new face of right-wing extremism in Europe, Anders Behring Breivik was a regular guy who expressed his anti-immigration views online.
Breivik, who confessed to the July mass murder in Norway that killed 77 people, appeared in his first public trial on Monday.
While Breivik could have acted alone, he was far from alone online: he spent a lot of time preparing for the attack at his computer, communicating with millions of nationalists who support right-wing groups on social media.
After the summer tragedy, researchers wanted to know more about these people.
But how do we find them?
It's easy, you just have to go to Facebook.
"We found that it's not that hard to get at them", says Jamie Bartlett, lead author of a recent report on European cyberpopulism by the British research centre DEMOS.
Facebook's personal data pool is so large, Bartlett says, that researchers could easily use the site's advertising tool to pinpoint the right demographic with scientific accuracy - something marketers have been doing for several years.
Bartlett's team found half a million right-wing band fans across Europe and then pitched them an ad, but instead of showing a new band or diet product, the ad offered the user to take a survey that asked about their level of education, their attitude to violence, and their optimism about their own future.
Using Facebook, Bartlett and his colleagues were able to interview more than 10,000 members of 14 far-right parties in 11 European countries - without even leaving their offices.
"It's a whole new way of doing research", says Bartlett.
Some of the results are not so surprising: online right-wing groups are mostly young men, dissatisfied with immigration.
But suddenly, "those who combine their online and offline activities are smarter, more democratic and less aggressive than those who just hide behind a monitor".
DEMOS is just one example of how Facebook is becoming a popular new tool in the hands of scientists.
Research centers, medical researchers, and political scientists are using the site to study everything from health issues to social trends that are expressed in likes, wall posts, and status updates.
With over 800 million active users, adding an average of three posts a day, Facebook's "super-relevant information" is driving a research boom, increasing the number of scientific articles with the site's title in the title by 800% over the past five years.
For some researchers, the beauty of Facebook is that it allows you to study people you can't reach on the street with a notebook.
"Before, if you wanted to interview people from the British National Party, it would be very difficult to identify them".
"You would have to join the party, and they would never accept you", says Bartlett.
"Facebook is eliminating all of that -- you're going to go directly to them".
Others say that the site could be used to identify and research social health problems.
A recent study by Dr. Megan Moreno of the University of Wisconsin, Madison, and her colleagues found that students who discussed their drunken exploits on Facebook were significantly more likely to be alcoholic than students who kept quiet about it.
Moreno suggests that peers of students, such as their dorm tutors, could monitor the site and intervene to help a student who is too often updating drunk status.
"You can't solve a problem without identifying it", said Dimitri Christakis, co-author of Moreno and director of the Center for Child Health, Behavior, and Development at the Seattle Children's Research Institute.
"We found a way to identify at-risk children who otherwise would not have been detected".
Facebook also constantly extracts various kinds of data about its users.
The site's data processing team processed statistics on relationship status and Valentine's Day, voter turnout at midterm in 2010, and the National Happiness Index (mostly using information only they have access to - cyberfreedom champions have long insisted that the site should make its vast data collection publicly available for research).
But Facebook users know that the site is watching them whether they like it or not -- in exchange for the chance to play Scrabble with a friend thousands of miles away, the site can process your personal data.
But what if Facebook users become participants in a study they don't even know about?
While researchers have strict rules for doing research offline, online data is publicly available.
"I don't think many users even thought about the possibility that a researcher might be watching their profiles", says Neil Selvin, a sociologist at the London Knowledge Lab, about a 2006 study he conducted using publicly available student Facebook pages.
"As far as they knew, it was just between them and their friends".
So the question is, how do we do it?
Even offline, there's no guarantee that the subject is completely honest.
On Facebook, it's impossible to know how much of the information in a user's profile and page is true.
"What you say on Facebook and what you do outside of Facebook are two completely different things", says Selvin.
That's why, despite years of research in technology, Selvin still thinks that the notebook and the pen are the best research tools that we can use.
"There's no substitute for going out into the real world and interacting with real people", he says.
"Social research is supposed to be about social, and most of the social is still offline".
"Cold and Inhuman": Anders Bering Breivik will appear in court for the first time
Anders Bering Breivik, the man who confessed to organizing the double attack that killed 77 people in Norway this summer, described himself as a "resistance" fighter during his first public appearance in court in Oslo.
"I am the military commander of the Norwegian Resistance and the Knights Templar of Norway", he told the courtroom of 500 people.
"I object to the court because you got your mandate from organizations that support a hate ideology and because it supports multiculturalism".
"I admit to the act, but I admit no guilt".
Justice Torquayle Nesheim interrupted Breivik during this monologue because he "did not want to give Breivik the opportunity to use this hearing as a platform for his own views".
For the same reason, he refused to allow Breivik, who had brought a pre-written speech, to address the relatives of the victims at the end of the hearing.
Nesheim also ordered the police to detain Breivik for another 12 weeks, banned him from the media for four weeks, and said authorities would strictly control all visits and correspondence for eight weeks.
About 30 survivors and relatives of the victims attended the hearing.
Some came hoping to see Breivik in the eye, others to make sure he was locked up.
Everyone came to find answers to their questions.
"I thought it looked cold and inhuman", one survivor told NRK.
"It was uncomfortable, but I was a little relieved after seeing and hearing the suspect".
Dressed in a dark suit and blue tie, Breivik remained calm and professional throughout the hearing and looked journalists and survivors in the eye as he entered and left the building.
Despite Breivik's strange idea that he was part of a larger "resistance" movement, the judge ruled that he was not insane, and said there was no evidence that he acted with accomplices.
Some may be reassured that the July 22 attacks appear to be the work of one extremist rather than a group of radicals.
But that doesn't automatically lessen the grief and confusion that the entire nation is feeling right now.
"I wish it looked like a monster, but it's not", said a relative of one victim.
"It would be so much easier if it were".
7 lessons from the lost Steve Jobs interview that's playing in the theater this week
After Steve Jobs' death on October 5, some compared him to Henry Ford, describing the technical genius as the Great Inventor of Modernity.
But what Apple fans might consider the biggest discovery in the newly discovered interview, which they recalled ahead of the major market previews this week, is how much this creative mind has understood in business processes and manufacturing technology.
He was, of course, a designer, a dreamer, and considered himself a hippie, but he was also a meticulous organizer and modernizationist of the manufacturing process, who believed that many business leaders suffered from "the sickness of thinking that a really great idea is 90 percent of the work... [but] a great idea is separated from a great product by a tremendous amount of skilled labor".
Back in 1995, Bob Kringley was creating the TV series Triumph of the Nerves about the advent of the personal computer, and he spent over an hour with Jobs having a unique, lengthy conversation.
By this time, it had been about 10 years since Jobs was fired from Apple, and he was already working all the way at his new computer company NeXT, waiting for the massive takeover of the Internet.
While a small portion of the Kringley interviews were used in the Nerds, he says the original interviews were lost in transport.
It wasn't until after Jobs' death that the full VHS copy was found in the director's garage.
This footage, slightly edited, is the basis for the 68-minute film Steve Jobs: The Lost Interview, which is coming to Landmark Theaters this Wednesday and Thursday.
For a man known for his hatred of in-depth interviews, Jobs seems unusually willing to lay out his technology philosophy and business strategy here.
And incredibly thoughtful.
There are four different points in the interview where there are long intervals between questions and answers -- 10 to 15 seconds of reflection, where Jobs is clearly weighing his thoughts to be precise.
There are also moments when Jobs's perfectionism comes to the surface, where he seems irritated by the questions of Cringley, forcing him to move more quickly to issues or phenomena of greater importance.
In the pre-Pixar, iPod and iPhone era, there's something ominously prophetic about Lost Interview, where Jobs evaluates what he sees different companies doing right and wrong, and offers his own vision of the future of information technology.
It's one thing to read about the post-mortem reviews of Jobs, but there's something vulnerable and inspiring about Jobs, who we see here, a troublemaking dreamer on the verge of greatness.
He has a vision of what things could and should be.
Soon after he said it all here, he went and did it.
A brief summary of the seven key findings of the Lost Interview:
About how he learned to run a business:
"All the time I've been in business, I've been asking, 'Why do you do this?' And the answer you're always getting is, 'Oh, it's just the way it's done.'
Nobody knows why they do what they do, nobody thinks deeply about business.
Here's what I found out.
Jobs goes on to detail his attempts to rationalize accounting at Apple.
Disrupted by the cost recording method, which often started with "standard costs" that were taken from the ceiling and then scaled up with "clarification", he created an automated structure that ensured they could track business expenses down to the smallest detail.
The joke about the Pope:
Jobs details the "blue box" he built with Steve Wozniak, a device that allowed people to effectively hack into a phone company and make long-distance calls for free.
The device has been written about a lot before, but the euphoria of Jobs here describing the blue box as an act of empowerment is contagious.
He tells how he and Wozniak tested the box using an automated telephone, ordering a call, and then connecting from one AT&T network to another until they connected as many stations as possible.
"We've been around the globe half a dozen times, and you've been yelling at the pay phone, and it's been heard a minute later at the next pay phone", Jobs says with a smile.
"We were young, and all we learned was that we could build something that could control billions of dollars of infrastructure around the world".
We both knew a little bit, but we could make a little thing that could control a big thing -- that was an incredible lesson, and I don't think Apple would have ever been without that.
Jobs goes on to detail one famous prank he and Wozniak almost pulled off, calling the Vatican through a blue box at midnight and asking for the Pope's phone, trying their best to copy Henry Kissinger.
When various members of the Catholic hierarchy were called in the middle of the night to speak to an American diplomat, the two broke out in laughter just before the Pope himself was picked up to answer the phone.
About being in love with technology (and calling Bill Hewlett cold):
At the age of 12, while hunting for spare parts for a frequency meter assembly, he found Bill Hewlett in the phone book and called him.
Shortly after their 20-minute phone conversation, Jobs got a summer job at Hewlett-Packard.
"It had a profound effect on me, it was the only company I saw at that age, and it shaped my view of what a company is and how well they treat their employees".
Jobs later became one of HP's employees who visited the company's research labs in Palo Alto, where he saw "the very first desktop computer".
It was the size of a suitcase, and it had a little monitor with an electron beam tube, and I fell in love with it.
I used to drive around HP as a teenager and go around that machine and write programs for it.
About the improvised innovation:
In several of the interviews, Jobs talks about inventing new products on the fly.
Early in his career, when he went to sell a handful of assembly boards, a buyer asked him to build a whole computer.
With only 30 days on credit, he had to think about both assembling and delivering the finished devices.
Later at Apple, he recalls the difficulties he faced while designing a computer mouse:
"I remember the ferocious arguments... they were yelling at me that it would take five years [to make a mouse that would cost $300], and I was sick to death, and I went out, and I found a designer".
90 days later, we had a mouse that we were able to assemble for 15 dollars, which was incredibly reliable.
The big companies that are losing power:
Long before he led the Apple renaissance, Jobs accurately foresaw how many industry leaders would misjudge the situation and lose control of their market share.
"Let's say you work at IBM or Xerox, so you make the best copier or printer, and what?"
You have a monopoly on the market, so the company doesn't get any better.
Sales and marketing make it more successful, so [these are the kinds of people] who end up in the company's leadership, and the people who make the product are pushed out of the decision-making arena.
The product genius that led to this monopoly position is being displaced by people who have no idea what the difference between good and bad products is -- the skill required.
That's what happened with Xerox...
Xerox could take over the entire IT industry.
It could be ten times bigger, could be Microsoft in the '90s...
They've been defeated by victory.
About innovation as an art form:
"A great idea is separated from a great product by a huge amount of skilled labor... when you roll out a great idea, it changes and grows".
You'll learn a lot about her subtleties.
There are compromises that you have to make -- some things you can't force electrons to make, glass, robots, or factories.
You have to keep 5,000 ideas in your head, these concepts, and you have to connect them all together.
It's all about taste in the end, it's all about trying to express yourself in the best that people have ever produced, and then trying to bring that into what you do.
Picasso said that good artists copy, great artists steal.
We've always been ashamed to steal great ideas.
Part of what made Macintosh famous was that the people who worked on it were musicians, poets, artists, zoologists, historians, who happened to be the best information technology experts in the world.
If it wasn't for information technology, they would be doing amazing things in other fields.
Scalia and Thomas have lunch with health care law opponents while the court is hearing the case.
On the day the Supreme Court convened behind closed doors to discuss the politically controversial question of whether it would hear President Obama's health care bill, two of its justices, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, were celebrating a lunch sponsored by the law firm that will be challenging the case before the Supreme Court.
This case occurred last Thursday when all nine judges met to discuss the petitions before the court.
One of the items on the agenda was a petition backed by 26 states challenging the fast-track health care overhaul passed by Congress last year, a law that united conservative activists across the nation.
The judges agreed to consider the case; in fact, a 5 1/2 hour turnaround hearing is expected in March 2012, and the outcome is likely to be a disruption to the presidential race, which will be in full swing by the time the verdict is announced.
The lawyer who will stand in court and argue that the health care law should be repealed is likely to be Paul Clement, who was the Deputy Attorney General under President George W. Bush.
Clement's law firm, Bancroft PLLC, was one of nearly two dozen firms that helped sponsor the annual dinner of the Federalist Society, a long-standing group that has consistently championed conservative legal principles.
The other firm that sponsored the lunch is one of the trade associations that challenged the law, the National Federation of Independent Business.
Another sponsor was the pharmaceutical giant Pflizer Inc, which has a huge financial interest in the outcome of the lawsuit.
The dinner was held at the Washington Hotel a few hours after the trial.
Attending, among others, was Mitch McConnell, the Republican leader in the Senate and a noted opponent of the health care bill.
- Who are the honored guests at the dinner?
It's nothing new. Two judges have been attending Federalist Society events for years.
And that's not at all against ethical standards.
In effect, judges are exempt from the Code of Conduct, which regulates the actions of lower federal judges.
If they had complied, they might have fallen under Principle 4C of the Code, which states: "A judge may attend charitable events of legal and other organizations, although a judge may not be a speaker, guest of honor, or be mentioned on the program of such an event".
However, Scalia and Thomas's apparent proximity to the two law firms in this case, as well as to a company with large financial interests, was a sufficient signal for ethics activists in government.
"This staggering violation of ethics and indifference to the code contradicts the claims of some judges that the court remains true to the same rules that apply to all other federal judges", said Bob Edgar, president of the Common Pleas.
"Judges drinking and dining at a formal fundraiser with lawyers whose cases are now pending in court".
Their appearance and their assistance in raising money for this event undermines all claims of impartiality and is unacceptable.
Scalia and Thomas are hardly paying attention to critics who say they are quite willing to mix up court cases with groups like the Federalist Society.
And Thomas' wife, Ginny, is a well-known conservative activist.
Moreover, conservatives argue that it is with Judge Elena Kagan that the ethical question arises, not Scalia and Thomas.
Kagan was the chief legal officer in the Obama administration when the first legal challenges to the law were filed at the first-instance level.
Her critics demanded that Kagan withdraw from the case because she was too involved in law enforcement then to be impartial now.
Kagan has no indication that she's going to do that.
Boeing receives record $ 18 billion in aircraft orders
Emirates is ordering 50 Boeing 777 wide-body aircraft and may order 20 more.
Boeing is also selling six Boeing Dreamliners to Oman Air, a deal worth more than $1 billion.
It's hardly news that the company is getting an order for 50 units of its product.
But this is a significant development, because this company is the Boeing Co., and the price tag for all 50 of these planes is 18 billion dollars.
Equally important is where Boeing got the order: the Middle East, a growing gold mine for future aircraft orders.
In a forecast released Monday, the Chicago-based company estimates that the Middle East will need 2,520 aircraft worth $450 billion over the next 20 years.
Boeing announced this weekend its largest dollar-equivalent commercial aircraft order ever, 50 Boeing 777s.
An incredible order came in from Emirates in Dubai.
The airline also has the option to buy 20 more aircraft, which will raise the total price of the pre-sales to $26 billion, Boeing said at the 2011 Dubai Airshow.
Later on Monday, Boeing reported that Oman Air had ordered six Boeing 787-8s, dubbed Dreamliners, which boast significantly better fuel economy and passenger convenience.
The price tag for six planes is over $1 billion.
"This is really good for Boeing", said Morningstar analyst Neil Diora.
"The quality of these particular buyers is pretty high".
Many Middle Eastern airlines are owned by oil-producing countries.
So not only do they have money to pay for planes, but the rise in fuel prices, which usually hurt airlines, because it's one of their biggest spending items, is not so damaging because the country makes money off of high oil prices.
This is important because they are less likely than other airlines to cancel their orders when prices rise, Diora said.
"They have a natural defense", he said.
The Emirates order strengthens Boeing's leadership in the wide-body aircraft market and helps prevent rival Airbus SAS from attempting to encroach on its dominance with its A350 airliner.
Boeing's win at the airshow came four months after Airbus said it would postpone the debut of its biggest A350, which rivals the 777-300ER.
It delayed its debut to increase axle load after customers demanded increased payload and range.
Boeing Co's stock is up 1.5% to $67.94.
The sister of the president of Mexico obviously lost the election in Michoacán.
Luisa Maria Calderón claims that drug dealers helped the opponent Fausto Vallejo of the IRP in the election race.
President Felipe Calderón's sister appears to have failed to pursue her bid for governor of Michoacán during the fierce state election, and she said Monday that drug dealers helped sway the race in favor of one of her opponents.
According to preliminary results, the leader in the race for the governorship of the western state is named Fausto Vallejo of the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or IRP.
"The interference of organized crime throughout the election process and especially yesterday is alarming, not only for Michoacán but for the whole country", said Luisa Maria Calderón in a radio interview the day after the Sunday vote.
"They intimidated our candidates, our workers in the election... They grabbed ballot boxes, they put obstacles... and they forced people to vote" for the IDP.
The I.R.P. ruled Mexico for seven decades until it lost the presidency in 2000.
She's preparing for a comeback, and winning in Michoacán is an important step in that effort.
The IRP hopes to win the presidential election in July.
Vallejo seems to have only slightly outpaced Calderón, which was leading the ratings before Election Day.
Calderón, a candidate for the National Action Party, or PND, led by her brother, refused to recognize Vallejo as the winner.
Silvano Aureoles, the candidate from the left-wing Democratic Revolutionary Party, or DRP, which now holds the governorship, came in third, a major defeat for the divided and unsuccessful left in the run-up to the 2012 presidential election.
Aureoles also refused to acknowledge the preliminary results.
Vallejo, the former mayor of the state capital of Morellia, denied any links to drug traffickers and urged other candidates to recognize the results.
The drug cartels that dominated Michoacán for a long time were specialized in marijuana, heroin, and methamphetamines.
This is President Calderon's home state, and he chose Michoacán to launch a military operation against drug traffickers in December 2006.
The violence is still going on.
The PND mayor was killed a week before the election when he was campaigning for Luisa Maria Calderón, and several candidates withdrew from the local election race out of fear.
For the IRP, however, as terrible as the Michoacan election may look, victory will give the party a driving impulse.
The man who is supposed to represent the I.R.P. in the presidential race, Enrique Pena Nieto, speaking from Washington, congratulated Vallejo and said, "I think this victory should be very encouraging in the run-up to next year".
ADB urges Asia to help save the euro area
The Asian Development Bank has committed India and China to be ready to help save the eurozone from the European debt crisis to avoid a long-term recession that would halt the growth of the Asian economy.
Rajat Nag, managing director of the ADB's Manila office, said the two fastest-growing major economies should "do everything they can" to speed up the recovery of the currency bloc with either the International Monetary Fund or direct bilateral agreements.
He warned that BRIC countries were looking at Europe's difficulties "impartially", and said that Asian financial assistance alongside European leadership and resources could help avoid a long-term downturn in the global economy.
"This is about all of us".
"So anyone who can help Europe get out of the crisis is useful", he told the Financial Times in an interview during the World Economic Forum in Mumbai.
"Asia may be somewhat protected, but it cannot be invulnerable".
"So if China and India can help, they should".
The European Monetary Union has been severely undermined by the European debt crisis in recent months.
In recent days, Italy's borrowing has risen alarmingly, and both the Italian and Greek prime ministers have resigned.
The spiraling debt crisis in Europe has raised fears that it could lead the world economy back into recession, and has led to calls for leading emerging economies to come together to help the eurozone find a solution.
Mr. Ng predicted that any Asian aid would be conducted through the IMF, but said that bilateral cooperation -- like buying bonds from the EU financial aid fund, the means to ensure financial stability in Europe -- provides a huge bargaining power to Asia's partners in Europe.
Anand Sharma, India's trade minister, said that "India will do everything it can" to help the eurozone as its own economy is now experiencing declining exports and decreasing inflows of foreign capital.
"Nobody wants the eurozone to remain unstable and unstable", he said.
"We have big challenges and we have to maintain high growth rates".
"It's not an option, it's a condition, because that's where we're going to find jobs for tens of millions of our young men and women".
Others argue that it makes no sense for emerging economies like India to help wealthy Europeans when they face their own deep economic problems.
Ashutosh Varshni, a professor at Brown University in the US, said it would be very difficult politically to provide aid to Europe for India's 1.2 billion people, of whom about 800 million live on $2 a day or less.
"At some point they'll find out that Greeks retire at 50 and go to the seaside for holidays, and it won't be well received", he said.
Lee Howell, managing director of the World Economic Forum, also wondered why India's reserves should be used to keep Greece's numerous and well-paid public sector workers employed in poorly organized, loss-making enterprises such as railways.
Mr. Ng said the eurozone crisis threatens to have "significant direct consequences" across Asia.
The Asian Development Bank's forecast of 7.5 percent growth in Asia in 2011/12 is now facing "degrading risks" due to the threat from Europe.
He said that vulnerable emerging markets need to develop "emergency plans" to protect themselves from recession and significant capital outflows from their economies.
The Pentagon 's dire warnings about potential cuts in defense spending
Defense Secretary Leon Panetta heated the situation Monday in Congress, warning that the expected automatic budget cuts would undermine national security and trigger a financial chain reaction from the Pentagon corridors to the Afghanistan battlefields on the line and to the civilian assembly.
The Pentagon is already getting used to $450 billion in cuts over the next decade, but now fears that additional cuts of $600 billion or more may be inevitable if Congress fails to agree on spending.
"The consequences of these cuts will be devastating to the department", Panetta said in a letter to Republican Senator John McCain of Arizona and Republican Lindsay Graham of South Carolina.
He said that the failure of Congress to pass a budget agreement and the resulting so-called sequestration initiated a 23% overall reduction and the termination of many new projects.
"Such a severe cut, so recklessly applied, would make most of our shipbuilding and construction projects unfeasible -- you can't buy three-quarters of a ship or a building -- and would seriously damage other modernization efforts", Panetta wrote to senators.
"We will also be forced to lay off many of our full-time employees, and since the cuts will be made so quickly, we will almost certainly have to lay off full-time employees to achieve our goal".
"These changes will undermine the trust of those who support our military and will seriously damage our combat readiness".
The cuts will ultimately affect military units, Panetta said.
"While military funding in the Overseas Emergency Operations is not directly affected by the sequester, military achievements will be severely affected by a major disruption in the core budgets", Panetta warned.
"Contract staff will be cut, ending with the cancellation of contracts and the supervision contract that supports the troops".
"Staff will be cut, which will lead to delays in payments to military suppliers, and legal and political support will be disrupted".
Two senators wrote to Panetta 10 days ago, requesting details of the possible implications of automatic cuts at the Department of Defense.
"The result of the Department of Defense sequester will be the rapid decline of the United States as the world's leading military power".
"We stand firm against these draconian actions", the senators said in a joint statement Monday night as they released Panetta's letter.
"This is not an option we can live with, and it's not an option we should impose on ourselves".
"Sequestration is a threat to the national security interests of the United States, and it cannot be allowed to happen".
Whether Panetta's letter or the Senators' recent warnings will lead to a budget compromise or intensify calls for the Pentagon to be relieved of the cuts, we'll see later.
Panetta was absolutely sincere about the potential cuts, even though he came to work at the Pentagon after years of budgetary scrutiny in Congress and the White House and realizing he was facing a tough choice.
At a press conference last week, the Secretary of Defense painted a bleak picture of what might follow -- a force with a shell but no nuclear.
"This is a ship without sailors".
"This is a bullet-free squad".
"This is the wing of an aircraft without adequate training".
"It's a paper tiger, an army with barracks and buildings and bombs without adequately trained soldiers capable of carrying out a mission", Panetta said in his opening remarks at the Pentagon.
"It is a force that suffers from unstable fighting spirit, poor readiness and incapable of fighting potential enemies".
"It basically encourages aggression".
In an appendix to his letters to McCain and Graham, Panetta articulated new details of how the cuts "create significant operational risks: slowing response to crises, conflicts and disasters; severely limiting our ability to be first to deploy and respond anywhere in the world; and leading to unacceptable risk in future combat operations".
And Panetta said that some of the biggest defense projects could face obstacles, including those that have already been tested, and some are only in the early planning stages.
This list includes the single-seat F35 Strike Fighter, a planned new bomber, a new-generation ballistic submarine, a new coastal zone warship, and a new ground combat vehicle that the Army and Marine Corps need to replace the hammer.
Stopping further development and testing of the F35 could save $80 billion over 10 years, but its supporters say it's a vital next step to improve and counter potential threats from China and other adversaries.
How to Catch a Lie
A quick glance at the latest headlines shows just how serious and pervasive deception and lies are in everyday life.
Republican presidential candidate Herman Kane is busy challenging sexual harassment allegations from several women; each side accuses the other of lying.
The University of Pennsylvania administration was charged with perjury for allegedly concealing that a retired football coach had raped boys.
Last week, French President Nicolas Sarkozy was caught on speakerphone telling US President Barack Obama that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was a liar.
Lies destroy careers and shake countries.
New York Congressman and Internet exhibitionist Anthony Weiner made a fool of himself by denying his pranks, which were quickly disproved by overwhelming evidence.
Former presidential candidate John Edwards has been charged with campaign finance fraud involving the concealment of extramarital affairs.
And again, no one who lived through that time will ever forget the media circus with President Bill Clinton being caught lying about his sexual relationship with Monica Lewinsky during his second term in office.
Stories of cheating on school and college exams are common.
There have been instances where teachers have given students answers to tests to get a good score for their own work.
Teachers who are supposed to teach the opposite are sending a message that lying and cheating are acceptable.
How many lies do we face?
In a single day, studies show you can be lied to between 10 and 200 times.
Now it's assumed that a significant portion of this is a lie to save.
Another study found that strangers lied three times in the first 10 minutes of meeting each other.
Lying and lying are skills that everyone needs for both personal and professional purposes.
Unlike a room game, like, say, charades where you have to say, "I got it!" lying detection is a serious area of knowledge based on scientific data collected over the last six decades at prestigious universities engaged in comprehensive research projects, especially in psychology and physiology.
One finding of the study is that most of the old myths about lying have been debunked.
Liars look in the eye.
They don't always stutter, stutter, blush, or fuss.
Do not conclude that liars are hard to spot and hard to expose.
An experienced lie-finder can get to the truth by observing the structure of statements, facial expressions, question structure, and temporal characteristics.
I've spent several years researching scientific discoveries in a vast and ever-growing segment of knowledge about lying, and it's clear that lie detection is a modern skill that's easy to learn and that helps you navigate in our complex world -- especially if your professional responsibilities involve recruiting, interviewing, negotiating or managing.
Good liars are excellent at reading others, making them feel at ease, managing their own emotions, and intuitively sensing how others perceive them.
We know from research that extroverts lie more than introverts, that men lie more about themselves, whereas women lie more about others, usually to protect someone's feelings, that married people lie less to their partners than single people do (but the lie they tell is often the most brazen).
We also know that if you're perceived as a liar, others will feel less guilty about cheating you.
How do you know if someone is lying?
First, observe the normal behavior of your subject.
This is called "defining the original state".
This helps provide a starting point for evaluating the changes further.
Observe the posture, the laughter, the voice characteristics of your subject.
You'd better know if a person is always kicking in a normal state, then you won't make unfair accusations when you see kicking in the middle of a meeting.
Then look for groups of deceptive verbal and nonverbal acts.
Treat these groups as red flags, not proof of deception.
Liars can focus on the upper part of their body when they're trying to remember their story, they can put their feet towards the door, lean toward the exit, change their posture in a certain way, or show "post-interview relief" -- this exaggerated sigh of relief and posture change when all the difficult questions are behind them.
Investigators often fake the end of the interview signal just to see that relief after the interview.
So pay attention to the language of your subject.
Scott Peterson is known to have backtracked and used the past to claim that his murdered wife was alive, leading to a nationwide manhunt.
The stalkers may also use distancing in speech, such as "I did not have sexual relations with this woman... Miss Lewinsky", or repeat the difficult question completely.
The most typical verbal indicators are barely perceptible.
Someone might use "qualifying language" when answering a difficult question, "Well... to be honest... as far as I know... as far as I know".
This makes the response more emotional than actual, and is often a red flag.
There is no magic to detecting lies, but you can master the art of cheating.
These skills will increase the chances of everyone avoiding being a victim of skilled swindlers in their professional and personal lives.
The controversial pipeline plan needs to be reviewed after US threat to delay approval
A few days after the Obama administration threatened to delay approval of a planned oil pipeline from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico -- provoking the ire of labor unions but calming environmentalists -- a company planning to build the pipeline says it is willing to reconsider the project to resume work on it.
TransCanada announced Monday night that it would remove a planned oil pipeline from the environmentally sensitive Sandhills region of Nebraska and is confident the project will still get approval.
The company announced the decision at a press conference at the Nebraska State Capitol.
TransCanada spokesman Alex Purbas says the company remains confident it will eventually get approval for the pipeline, albeit with a different route.
This comes after the State Department said last week that it would delay a federal decision on the project until it explored new possible routes that do not affect the Sandhills region of Nebraska and the Ogallala aquifer, a vast underground water reservoir.
"This is a real step forward", said Lee Terry, a Republican from Nebraska, to Fox News.
A new environmental review commissioned by the State Department is likely to delay decision-making until 2013, after next year's election, though authorities have denied that politics were involved.
Obama in a written statement last week called the decision a call from the State Department, and expressed his support for it.
The 1,700 mile pipeline is supposed to run from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico.
It's supposed to move 700,000 barrels a day from Alberta to refineries in Texas.
To do that, he's got to cross six states.
It's hated by environmentalists but loved by the unions, who hope for the approximately 20,000 jobs associated with the pipeline.
But Nebraska lawmakers opposed to the plan are considering a bill to speed up the move from the Sandhills area and the Ogallala aquifer, a major source of drinking water and irrigation.
The State Department's current environmental impact study found that the project would have only limited negative environmental impact, but a source in the energy industry said the Department's auditor ordered a separate review of the review process, focusing on two issues.
One is whether the lobbyist hired by TransCanada, Paul Elliott, who was an adviser to Hillary Clinton's 2008 campaign, represents a conflict of interest for the program.
The other was whether the choice of the firm that was hired to do the original study was inappropriate, as it was affiliated with TransCanada.
Patty LaBelle is being sued for allegedly causing a child to feel nauseous out of fear.
The family in New York state claims that disco diva Patty LaBelle started a riot in the lobby of their Manhattan home, scaring their young daughter to the point that she vomited with fear.
The "Lady Marmalade" singer's tirade frightened 18-month-old Genevieve Monk so much that she suffered "personality changes, sleep disorders" and "a severe fear of strangers", her family said in Manhattan Superior Court.
It happened on November 10th of last year, when stage manager Kevin Monk, his wife, the kindergarten teacher, Rosanna, and Genevieve were about to go on a family trip.
While Kevin Monk was catching the car, Rosanna Monk came down to the lobby of the Riverside Boulevard with their luggage, carrying Genevieve.
Rosanna Monk said she stopped by the door and let her daughter down for a minute.
"Someone came up to me from behind and said, 'Do you know what your daughter is doing?' I said, 'Yes,' and went to get her", she said.
LaBelle angrily gave a speech to a pregnant woman.
"She said aggressively, 'You shouldn't have left your daughter at the door,'" said Rosanna Monk.
"I told her, 'I don't care what you say or think.'"
She got angry and started using profanity -- the C word and the F word -- in high tones...
She had a bottle of water, and she started pouring water out of the bottle on me.
She said Genevieve was hysterical.
"I said to this woman, 'Look what you did to my daughter,'" said the mother of the child.
LaBelle rushed at the mother - who was still holding Genevieve - and her escorts had to hold her and push her into a waiting car, said Rosanna Monk.
The baby was crying so hard that she was throwing up, she added.
Later, the family sent LaBelle a note demanding an apology, but received no response.
LaBelle's lawyer and representatives are not returning calls for comment.
The amount of damages was not disclosed, but the family's attorney, Sam Davis, said he took the case for free and that the family plans to donate any money it receives to charity for children with cancer.
"The goal is to hold Patty LaBelle accountable", Davis said.
"This is absolutely unacceptable behavior, especially toward a kindergarten teacher with an 18-month-old baby in her arms".
Climate problems have slowed the economy
During the first year of Mario Lopez's rule, Sinaloa saw an increase in unemployment and the illegal labor market, a decline in foreign funding, and a weakening of the economy.
2011 is the year that will go down in Sinaloa's economic history as being associated with the first year of the government of Mario Lopez Valdés, also called the year of change, which generated great hopes for the development of the economy, but given the adverse climatic conditions at the beginning of the year, there was no growth, however, there was a decline in the main indicators of economic development.
The low temperatures in February not only led to millions of dollars in losses for the agricultural sector, but they limited the state economy's growth opportunities, causing economic activity to decline by 3.6 percent overall in the first half of the year, largely due to a historic 31.16 percent drop in agriculture, which affected the dynamics of other sectors of the economy.
According to the report on areas affected by frost provided by the Mexican Council for Sustainable Rural Development, 835,582 hectares were affected, of which 78.03 percent were affected entirely, and the remaining 21.07 percent were partially affected.
The decline in economic activity caused, until November, a steady increase in unemployment in the state, according to the National Institute of Statistics and Geography, during the first three quarters there was an accelerated increase in the unemployment rate, from January to March 55,053 residents of Sinaloa were unemployed, with a share of 4.53 percent of the economically active population, in the second quarter the share increased to 5.28 percent, and from July to September it continued to grow to 6.19 percent, the share which in the number of people is more than 74,000 unemployed residents of Sinaloa, which is 18,969 more people compared to the first half.
Liquidity decreases
The unemployment in Sinaloa during the year is overshadowed by many factors, for economist Gerardo López Cervantes, director of the Faculty of Economics and Social Sciences of the Autonomous University (UAS), the growth of unemployment can be explained indirectly, by actions that were taken in public policy.
"What we're seeing now is an increase in unemployment, which is due to several factors, including the loss of liquidity in the marketplace to limit resources imposed by a law that was passed by Congress to fight money laundering, because people who illegally own dollars are not easy to work with, invest and use", he said.
Immigration is suspended
Lopez Cervantes said that there is also a demographic factor in the rise of unemployment.
"The number of people who leave the state to look for work abroad in the U.S. has been limited, firstly because of the difficulty of entry, and secondly because once they enter, they already face a lot of difficulties in finding work, so a group of people stay and demand jobs here in the state, resulting in an increasing unemployment rate", he said.
Violation of formal requirements
Sinaloa's labour market analysis is made worse by the high number of labour violations that prevail in the workplace, with INEGI stating that 60.38 percent of the state's active population work without being listed as workers in any social protection institution.
In addition to unemployment and layoff violations, another reminder of the state's work is its low wages; the state has the lowest salaries in the country, according to records from the Mexican Institute of Social Security and the Ministry of Labor and Social Welfare.
The average monthly income of Sinaloa workers was 5,352 pesos until September, well below the national average of 7,375 pesos.
FDI reduction
In addition to the decline in economic activity and high unemployment, 2011 saw the largest outflow of foreign direct investment in the last 10 years, according to the Treasury Department, with January-July state FDI totaling $630,697, a drop of 87.74 percent from $5,143,312 during the same period last year.
For its part, the State Government's Ministry of Economic Development recorded only 17,280,000 pesos of investment during the year, which mostly fell on companies in the service sector.
The debt
Amid the economic downturn, the state government asked the state congress in July for approval of a loan of 3 billion pesos to be used for infrastructure projects in 18 municipalities to revive the economy, only 2.600 million pesos were approved locally, and until November, no debt benefits were expected in any sector of the state economy.
Reactions
For businessmen, the first year of the government of Mario Lopez Valdés demonstrates the lack of government capabilities.
Miguel Loredo Lopez, president of the National Chamber of Manufacturing, said that during 2011 there was a lack of coordination between the wishes of various sectors, including the state government itself.
"The efficiency of the economy in Sinaloa this year was really low, we have to work hard to regain the positions we lost this year, in 2012 we have to double our efforts, we have not been able to coordinate the efforts of everyone and, above all, the good and synchronized work of the new government team, we hope that next year will be much better", he said.
The slowdown in the economy
Lopez Loredo said events such as the early freezes this year have halted the state's economy and limited its efficiency and growth.
"The low volumes of the economy are the result of several events, including the freeze, one of the main effects was a slow economy that is not getting fast enough to create economic dynamics that allows for an acceptable level of processes, goods and services and therefore at the end of the year we close it below our expectations", he said.
Reviewing the direction
Teodoro Salazar Uriarte, president of the Confederation of Mexican Republican Employers in Sinaloa, said the state needed to continue the most dynamic manufacturing activity.
"Overall, we found that we were working on it, we believe that it is necessary to develop a long-term program that will redefine the direction and economic course of the state, it is necessary to mobilize all the material and human resources that Sinaloa has", he said.
The work ahead
President Coparmex stressed the importance of defining the future direction to better direct the government's efforts.
"Overall, I would say that the Government is trying to be successful in various areas, in terms of economic development there is little progress, but it is important to develop a long-term program", he said.
He noted that the current administration has demonstrated progress in its own way of conducting public policy.
"There are facts that allow us to say that the government is starting to get involved, and that I can say that some work has been done, and I think the government is realizing that there is still a lot to do", he said.
He 's being sentenced for 8 kilos of marijuana .
Five years in prison and a fine of 100 days' income - a sentence imposed on a citizen of the Navalato for possession of eight kilograms of marijuana.
The prosecutor general's office said the convicted drug dealer is Omar Alexis Valenzuela Sandoval, convicted of a crime against health, in this case, possession of marijuana with intent to distribute.
According to the AP/SIN/CLN/687/2010/MI case, Valenzuela Sandoval was arrested by the Mexican military on June 7, 2010 while patrolling the Cipriano Valdez street, in front of post No. 80 in El Castillo, Navolato.
The drug dealer was driving a white pickup truck, in which he carried a black bag in a trunk in the car, and on the passenger seat a small backpack, where soldiers found eight kilograms and 23 grams of marijuana.
For these reasons, the seized property was transferred to the Second District Court, and the defendant continues to be a prisoner at the Crime Victims Support Center.
You gotta make contributions to the work .
Public works related to programs such as Homeland, Save Public Spaces and 3×1 for migrants are at risk of being left unfinished or delayed for a long time due to lack of funds, Miguel Angel Lopez Miranda said.
The Municipal Social Development Director pointed out that while the work programs have been developing so far, they are in danger as the state government is unable to make the appropriate contributions, which amount to more than 11 million pesos for all three programs.
He noted that the total funding for all three programs is about 50 million pesos, of which the state must contribute 25 percent, and so far only the Federation and the Municipality have provided resources for the work, so there is still a possibility of delay in their completion.
"They have to invest almost 12 million, and although the year is ending, they haven't given us a penny when they were supposed to give us a part from the beginning of July", he said, "to avoid delay, we started the work and they have made great progress, but we need the money".
He mentioned that last year, during the reign of Jesus Aguilar Padilla, the state did not make the contributions it was supposed to make, so at the beginning of the reign the municipality had to borrow money to cover over 7 million, an amount that was not provided in that case by the state administration.
"This happened to us in the previous administration because the state didn't have the financial capacity to participate and the programs continued to evolve, and this year to access these programs, we need to find resources to cover what the state owes", he explained.
While the state has an obligation to deliver these resources, he says the request was made on behalf of the Secretary of Administration and Finance, Armando Villarreal, to step up efforts so that the interest related to them comes as soon as possible.
"They have to contribute almost 12 million, and even though the year is ending, they haven't given us a penny".
The court will approve the "digital television transition" in Mexico in 2015
The shift from analogue to digital is one of the most important changes the world has seen in recent years.
The Supreme Court (SJ) rejected the constitutional claims made by the Senate and House of Representatives against the presidential decree that postpones the so-called "transition to digital television" from 2021 to 2015, as the eight votes needed to cancel it were not collected.
A minority of the four ministers, including the President of the Court, Juan Silva Mesa, considered that President Felipe Calderón did not exceed his powers by issuing a decree detailing the actions to transition to digital terrestrial television.
As a result, the constitutional claims filed by the Senate were rejected for lack of the qualified majority of eight votes required for the court to rule on the constitutionality or unconstitutionality of the decree, and it remains in effect.
The draft statement, prepared by Minister Olga Sanchez Cordero, proposed declaring the decree unconstitutional because regulating radio and television programming is a right enshrined in law by the Federal Commission on Telecommunications (Cofetel), in violation of the principles of hierarchical subordination and legislative reserve.
Only Salvador, Jorge Mario Pardo, Margarita Luna and Sanchez Cordero voted in favour of the project.
On this argument, both the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies held two constitutional debates to refute the decree and support the complaints, and Minister Sanchez Cordero suspended the decree and all actions mentioned in it regarding the transition to digital broadcasting.
At the meeting of ministers it was also decided to reject the demand of the Chamber of Deputies, without entering into the discussion of the project, also under the responsibility of Minister Sanchez Cordero.
In his speech, the Prime Minister said that he disagreed with the arguments of the draft in the sense that the federal executive cannot define by general rules the measures to which the state administration should prepare.
"I also don't think if it happened it would affect the autonomy of the regulatory body", and reminded that planning public policy in strategic areas such as the telecommunications sector has to do with the federal executive, which has a constitutional mandate, governing the state.
The replacement of analogue signals with digital ones is one of the most important changes that has happened in recent years, resulting in better use of the radio spectrum, better signal quality, and more channels.
Postponing the transition, he said, would mean postponing the benefits of a digital transformation that includes meeting public needs that have more than a technical dimension, "as it covers economic, social, political issues and national security issues".
These issues, he said, "require the work of the whole system, formed on the principle of state economic management, including a group of authorities that the Constitution unites into the state executive".
He recalled that a large number of countries around the world have already completed the transition to digital broadcasting, and have done so with the help of the executive branch, despite the presence of narrowly-specific technical institutions.
It cannot be concluded that the government, by adopting the decree under discussion, which in any case affects the competence of Congress, ensures compliance with the laws passed by the Legislative Assembly in the administrative sphere, he said.
The Michoacan is analyzing the possibility of counting "votes by votes"
According to data transmitted to the PPRV, the difference between first and second place in the gubernatorial election is only 27 percent, even without counting the votes, which are 879 out of a total of 6,074 protocols.
The possibility of counting "vote by vote" is real with respect to this year's election process in Michoacán, where, according to data obtained from the Preliminary Election Results Program (PPRV), the difference between first and second place in the gubernatorial election is only 27 percent, even without counting the votes that come to 879 out of a total of 6,074 minutes.
In light of this, the chair of the General Council of the Michoacán Electoral Institute (IMI), Maria de Los Angeles Lyandreal Saragossa, recalled that a few days ago, on November 9, the electoral corps approved a package of principles to harmonize local rules with federal electoral reform.
It should be recalled that Michoacán did not adopt the Constitution or the State Electoral Code or the Voting Rights Act, as the state Congress approved the reforms shortly before the legal deadline for their entry into force in this electoral process and Governor Leonel Godoy Rangel did not include its publication within the deadlines set by the law in the State Official Gazette, stating that he had some objections.
On the same day, November 9, the Supreme Court of Justice (SJC) ruled on a constitutional claim by a local legislature, and called the state representative's vote on constitutional reform "invalid and illegal" because he had no right to "allow or support them".
In an interview about the possibility of "vote after vote", Maria de los Angeles Lyanderal argued that with the adoption of appropriate principles by the General Council of the IMC it would become possible to submit a partial or complete count of votes to the local electoral body.
For example, a partial recount of one or more ballot boxes may be made if: the results of the minutes do not match; there is no voting and counting record in the ballot box or it is not with the chairman; or when there are obvious errors or corrections in the record.
Furthermore, a general recount of votes in all ballot boxes in an election may take place when there is an indication that the difference between the presumed winner of the election under consideration and the second-place candidate in the vote is less than or equal to one percent, provided that at the beginning of the session there is a request from the representative of the party and/or coalition that put forward the second of the mentioned candidates.
A total recount will also be made if at the end of the normal counting it is established that the difference between the winner and the candidate who came second is less than or equal to one percent, provided that there is a request from the political party whose candidate came second, in case the ballot boxes that were taken into account in the partial recount are excluded.
It is worth noting that in this situation are the elections in Morelia, where, according to the PPRV, the difference between the first and second place is only 0.16 percent, not even counting 129 votes out of the total number of 923 protocols.
His last will and testament
His ashes will be scattered in the Sappana Mountains, the family confirms.
The remains of pilot Felipe Basio Cortés arrived in Saltillo, his hometown, on Sunday evening; a funeral mass was held Monday.
According to the family, the last will of the lieutenant colonel was that his ashes be scattered in the Sappalinama Mountains.
After accepting condolences along with others who died in the crash, the Bassio Cortes family returned to the capital of Coahuila aboard a Mexican Air Force aircraft, with the closest people attending the ceremony in Campo Marta.
At noon, the lieutenant colonel arrived at the chapel on Nazario Ortiz Garcia Boulevard, where his family and friends were arriving.
At 5:30 p.m. he passed the Santillo Institute of Technology examination, organized by his former high school classmates and the football team, of which Felipe Basio was a member during his high school years.
"He wanted to return to Saltillo and have his ashes scattered in the Sapariname mountains, and he always told his family and friends", reported Sandra Cortes Basio, the pilot's sister.
In her opinion, the lieutenant colonel fulfilled all her dreams, she believes that he was at the peak of his life, "he was a successful man, an incredible father, son and loving brother, devoted to his family".
Felipe Cortes Basio left the city of Saltillo at a very young age to enroll in the Aviation College in Sappano, Jalisco.
Some people didn't believe him, they said he was dizzy even in a truck, but he always wanted to fulfill his dream of becoming a pilot.
His nephew Jorge Alberto Davila Basio remembers him as a very good man, "as soon as he arrived in Saltillo the whole family wanted to welcome him, like when he brought Marta Saagún to Saltillo".
The young man recalls that even when he was seven years old, he went to Sapporo for his cousin's graduation ceremony, so he knows that his uncle died doing what he loved most in life: flying a plane.
He's being escorted to the last road.
Gunfire rang out in honor of the Mexican Air Force lieutenant colonel Felipe Cortes Basio, led by Governor Jorge Torres Lopez, people from the village and the state government, the Mexican Army, from the Sixth Military Zone, the Mexican Air Force itself, the leaders and students of the Saltillo High School of Technology, where he studied in 1985 and made success in both studies and sports, guided him to his last journey.
Basio Cortés died recently when the helicopter he was piloting crashed, along with the Secretary of the Provincial Government, José Francisco Blake Mora, and six others, all representatives of that ministry.
At 6:05 p.m., the remains of Basío Cortés (cremated), a Saltillo resident, arrived to be delivered by the funeral home to members of the Mexican Air Force led by Major James Martínez, on the grounds of the training school, where he was already awaiting his family, including his daughter Amanda and his wife Cristina, her mother, brothers and other relatives, students and teachers.
Three bodies found abandoned at the Kadareyt Farm .
Hours before the discovery, the military authorities showed the media 11 people who had been detained in the same municipality for crimes related to organized crime.
Three men were found shot to death in different parts of the body with a control shot at an abandoned farm in the municipality of Cadereita Jiménez, Nuevo León.
The find was found on the 1.5 kilometer Cadereita highway towards Santiago, on a hill in the commune known as El Castillo.
Some people who passed by noticed that the doors of a village house painted in beige and brown were open.
When they looked inside, literally three meters away, they found three bodies, and they immediately notified the authorities.
One of the men was wearing a yellow T-shirt with black jeans, no shoes, and next to him was another man in a white T-shirt.
About a meter away was the body of another man, in a red shirt and blue jeans.
All three of them were lying face down.
According to the evidence collected there, three people were killed elsewhere because there were no shells on the spot.
The fence of the village house has signs addressed to one organized criminal group to another, and there are several bullet holes in it and in the gates.
11 caught in Cadereite
The Ministry of National Security has presented 11 people, including a minor, who were part of a criminal group that operated mainly in the municipality of Kadereyt, and who are accused of kidnapping, murder, "fraud" and secret burials.
According to published information, initially on November 11, eight people were detained in the Los Alveros Colony, and one person who was held hostage was rescued.
They were provided with three houses and a telephone, demanding to join a criminal group called Los Zetas.
Another incident occurred on November 12 at 06:00 a.m., when military personnel were patrolling the Old Rancho village in Cadereyt, when they saw an unmarked car with two men in the cabin.
When they stopped them and inspected them, the military found a rifle, a cartridge and 18 rounds.
Later, after these statements, on November 13 at 14:00 one of their accomplices was stopped on La-Pravda public land, who, seeing the military, tried to escape.
He is accused of secret burials in the municipalities of Heneral Tehran, Hina and Kadereyt.
The new Italian government will be formed on Wednesday
The newly appointed Prime Minister, Mario Monti, will meet tomorrow with the President of Italy to introduce a new government that will face the crisis that has brought the country to the brink of economic disaster.
The newly appointed Italian Prime Minister, Mario Monti, will meet with the Italian President on Wednesday to introduce a new government that will face the crisis that has brought Italy to the brink of economic disaster and has damaged the entire eurozone.
A statement from the presidential palace said that Monte, appointed on Sunday, would meet with President Giorgio Napolitano on Wednesday to confirm that he could form a government.
He is expected to introduce a cabinet made up mostly of technocrats, although it is unclear when the new executive branch will take its place.
Monti said he would present the president with the results of his negotiations with political parties in his attempt to form a government.
"I want to reaffirm my full confidence in our country's ability to get through this difficult period", the former European Commissioner told reporters.
Monty did not say directly that he was able to form a government, but the tone of his comments showed that the obstacles had been overcome.
"The structure is well-defined now", he said.
Monti completed the process of forming a government in less than three days, which is much less than usual, as Italy struggled with a political and financial crisis that brought their debt levels to a critical level.
The administration, led by former European Commissioner Monti, must approve the austerity package demanded by European leaders to restore confidence in Italy.
Under pressure from the volatile markets, Monti was forced to rush Italy's 10-year BTP yield to above 7 percent, the level at which Greece and Ireland had to be bailed out.
Emma Marchegalia, leader of the Italian Federation of Employers, told reporters after meeting with Monte: "We said we would actively support this government".
We believe that this government is Italy's last chance to get out of this critical situation.
Monti's chances of success were largely based on the support of the LDP party of Silvio Berlusconi, who was forced to resign on Saturday due to the crisis.
"We believe that Professor Monti's efforts should lead to a good outcome", Angelino Alfano, the secretary of the centre-right party, told reporters.
The support of the LDP, the largest party in Italy, is significant because until now many of its members have opposed the government majority of technocrats that Monti is forming.
Parliamentary support
The new Monti government must have strong parliamentary support to carry out reforms that are likely to be unpopular with austerity reforms.
Any blocking or suspension of these attempts could lead to a new and devastating attack on financial markets.
The Italian Association of Foreign Banks has stepped up pressure, warning that Monte's failure could be a disaster.
Monti began his consultations on Monday with political parties, unions and business groups, as well as youth and women's organizations.
He'll finish his rounds Tuesday night.
Monti was appointed on Sunday by Napolitano, who authorized an extremely rapid transition in response to the crisis.
After a brief hiatus late last week when it became clear that Berlusconi would resign, the value of Italy's debt has now reached a critical level amid uncertainty over whether the new prime minister will be successful.
Bailing out Italy with a public debt of 1.8 billion euros would be too much for the modern financial protectors of the eurozone.
Monti said his government would exist until the next election scheduled for 2013, despite widespread predictions that politicians would only give him time to carry out reforms before calling new elections.
Monti said he would like to include politicians in his cabinet, but the main parties insist it should be made up of only technical experts, a sign of their dissatisfaction that the process is affected by the financial situation.
Political sources reported that the mutual distrust and disagreement between the parties complicated the attempt to include political figures.
The Spaniards have more experience than Ticos.
Of the 22 players who have been declared in Spain, ten have played 50 international matches.
For Costa Rica, only one of the 22 players declared played 50 matches.
A slight contrast to Costa Rica, when compared to the 22 players called up by both countries for a friendly match today at 3:05 p.m. at the National Stadium in San Jose.
While the world and European champions, number one in the FIFA monthly rankings, have a whole list of Class A qualifiers, Tricolor only has defender Michael Uman as the only one to have played 50 international matches.
This was achieved last Friday in a game against Panama (0-2), at Rommel Fernandes Stadium.
Spanish footballers playing in the All-Star League and the strong clubs of the English Premier League have been very active in the league and local cup competitions during this year, and they are high-level players in the European Cups and the Champions League.
Add to that the Spanish Fury's experience in the difficult qualifying rounds of the Euro or World Cup.
Ticos players, however, have limited international experience in a zone like CONCACAF, which is considered the lowest level in FIFA.
We see that the Spanish national team is led by goalkeeper Iker Casillas, who last Sunday against England (a match lost 0-1 in London) repeated the record of ex-goalkeeper Andoni Subisarreta, with 126 international matches.
Casillas will play against Tricolor today and set a new record of 127 international appearances for Spain.
Javier Hernández, the Barcelona player, has 106 matches.
Casillas and Xavi were named the best of the UEFA last week, along with another player from the Iberian team, Subisarreta, with 126 matches and Schalke's Raul Gonzalez with 102.
Carles Puyole is almost 100 with 97 games.
They are followed by Javier Alonso with 91, Fernando Torres with 90, David Villa and Sergio Ramos, both with 81, Andrés Iniesta with 62, Cesc Fabregas with 61 and David Silva with 53.
On the Costa Rica side, Michael Umaña, left-sided Juan Díaz with 48 and the bomber Brian Ruiz with 45.
Then, only five have crossed the 30 game mark: Keilor Navas with 31, Randall Asofeif with 32, Michael Barrandez with 31, Carlos Hernandez with 36 and José Luis López with 35.
The rest.
More than 30 matches in Spain have been played by Gerard Pique (37), Sergio Busquets (36), Santiago Santi Casorla (32), Alvaro Arbeloa (31) and Raúl Albiol (31).
The team with fewer than 30 appearances on the field has Roy Miller with 26, Winston Parks with 26, Gabriel Badilla with 25 and Roy Murray with 23.
The rest didn't even make it to 20.
While Nacho Morael has only four games, and Horde Alba has two, in Costa Rica Victor Bolivar has only one, Olman Vargas and Nelson Edder have not yet debuted.
Spain's leading scorer David Villa with 50 goals, followed by Fernando Torres with 27.
For Costa Rica, Brian Ruiz was the top scorer, twice as many as Carlos Hernandez and three times as many as Roy Murray and Parks.
The quintet has embarked on a tour to mark the 20th anniversary of their career.
A trip to Costa Rica is a dream come true.'
In an exclusive interview with Viva, Pearl Jam bassist Jeff Ament said the band is ready to give one of their best gigs next Sunday at National Stadium.
It's been over 20 years of waiting, but the band says it's also a dream come true for them to play in this country.
That was the claim of bassist and founder Jeff Ament, who gave an exclusive interview to Viva from Brazil last week.
The band is in South America as part of a twentieth anniversary tour and will make their only stop in Central America on Sunday, the 20th.
They will perform at the National Stadium starting at 7:30 p.m. with the Los Angeles team The X and local band Las Robertas.
This is an excerpt from the interview, the full transcript of which is available online at The Nation.
For your fans in Costa Rica, is it a dream come true that Pearl Jam will play in Costa Rica?
A trip to Costa Rica is a dream come true for us too.
This is only our second visit to South and Central America, and so far, everything is going well.
I've only been to Costa Rica once - on vacation, it's a beautiful country, and I think we can stay there for a few days.
So we're really excited to bring our music there.
I ask this because there's a certain amount of loyalty to the band; fans live in tension in the days leading up to the show.
What would you say to your most loyal fans?
Thank you for being with us all these years.
It took us almost 21 years to get to Costa Rica, thank you for waiting so long, and we're sorry it took us so long to get here.
Some people, in anticipation of your concert, are treating it as the biggest show of the year.
Does that add a little tension to your visit?
Some of the biggest shows we've played in the last 21 years have been in the last two weeks.
We've done some great shows in São Paulo and we hope that it's gotten us in shape for this concert in Costa Rica.
We really want to play here.
We love this country, we love surfing and the jungle, and when it comes to those two things, Costa Rica is one of the best countries in the world.
How did you learn about Costa Rica and its surf waves?
We have a lot of surfer friends, and I have a good friend who lives in Tamarindo, and the waves here are amazing.
My friends go surfing all the time in Costa Rica and Nicaragua, and Mexico, which are great places to surf, and that's how we learned about it, from people who love surfing.
Looking at the tour, you've done some great shows with a lot of songs.
What are your plans for the Costa Rica show?
Since we've never played there before, we have no limitations on what we can do.
We're going to try to do the best show we can with the most diverse songs; we're going to try to play a few songs from each album and present our fans with the most diverse repertoire.
You never repeat the repertoire.
How does that happen?
I think part of it is because we have nine records and we can play over 120 songs, and everyone likes different songs, so it's hard to pick which songs to play every night.
When we have two or three songs that we haven't played in a while, it keeps us in tune and surprises us, because it reminds us of the reasons why we loved those songs and what we might have forgotten.
It makes the show more interesting for us and therefore, I think, makes it more interesting for people.
This tour is your 20th year in the business.
Looking back, it's hard to believe all the things you've done?
Yes, of course.
First of all, I don't think either of us ever imagined that we'd be in a rock band, and the fact that we've been doing this for over 20 years makes it seem like a dream.
We're happy with our luck and we're very excited that we can continue to make music together.
We all love each other and we all love making music.
We're happy to travel to places in the world we've always wanted to go.
Things are going really well for us.
What does it mean to you to be a significant part of the grunge boom?
It's always been an honor to be part of this group of great collectives.
We're good friends with the guys from Soundgarden, Mudhoney and Alice in Chains.
It's great when a movement grows out of a group of friends, and that's unusual.
Every once in a while, one group from one city shows up, but it's much stranger when five or ten groups show up at the same time in one city.
We're proud and honored to be part of a group from Seattle.
I still play with some of them from time to time.
Last year we were at the Alice in Chains festival and we were in Canada with Mudhoney, and we saw Soundgarden on their tour, so we're happy to be friends with all of them and we're honored to be part of the Seattle sound that's come out.
It's also very strange that a band like yours has stayed together and in the same line-up for so long.
Yeah, the four of us have been together 21 years, and Matt joined us 13 years ago, which is way longer than most bands have been.
First, I think we're lucky to be alive, and second, we care about others.
We're all very close friends, and because of that, there were also musical avenues that give everyone the freedom to experiment.
We trust each other's music, and it couldn't be better.
Your attitude to the word glory was not easy; but thanks to your success you were able to do everything you wanted to do.
How do you find the balance?
As we got older, it became easier to find balance.
We make sure we don't stay on tour too long, because it's easy to get into this game with big crowds and people who love your music.
As long as you remember that people are here for music, it reminds you that you have to respect music and what it's made of, not deciding to be famous and be a rock star, which is something that none of us really care about.
How do you remember your other project, Manother Love Bone?
I think we're writing really good songs and it was great at the beginning.
We were together for almost three years and didn't release an album until Andy died.
There were a lot of disappointments because it's been so long, and the most important thing is that we're still close friends with Bruce and Greg, who started with us in the band, and when I hear a song or see a picture, I think about the incredible person that Andy was, and how he made me laugh, it was always fun to go to work, laugh, talk about music and football and so much more.
He was a wonderful man, and we miss him.
The local band Las Robertas will be responsible for the opening of the show in Costa Rica.
Is it true that you're familiar with her work, especially Eddie Vedder, and that's why you chose her to open?
Yeah, the producers sent us a couple of video suggestions, and it was the band we liked the most, so we're really excited to see what Las Robertas can offer live, and it should be really exciting.
Why do you always change the lyrics to Yellow Ledbetter at concerts?
It's a question for Ed, so I don't know.
He sings it and I think he uses the first thing that comes into his head.
Who influenced you as a bassist?
There's so many of them.
Among the first to come to mind are Geiser Butler, John Entwistle, C.J. Ramon, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Duckowski...
There's so many I could talk all day about the bass players I love.
How did Pearl Jam succeed in keeping the grunge out of the way when it was no longer in fashion?
I think we all feel a little bit detached from the word grunge.
When I think about it, it reminds me of bands that I mentioned earlier, like Mudhoney, Soundgarden, Nirvana, and all the other bands that came out at the same time, and if it's important now, I think it's great, because it's music that's worth listening to, and bands like Mudhoney are making music better now than ever.
Your music was more gloomy at first, but now it's more positive.
How would you explain this change?
It's interesting because I think there are a few songs on the album that might seem easier, but there are songs like The End or Just Breathe that are considered very dark, although they may sound a little bit positive.
Both of them, when Ed played them, I cried when I listened to them, these songs are very dark.
I think that when you're growing up, and you've had some trauma in your life and you've lost a family member or a friend, those events start to affect your creativity and your music, and these two songs, of course, reflect that for me.
So I think you can be a happy person and still be able to make dark music.
Peru:
Fuhimori was hospitalized again for medical examination
Former President Alberto Fujimori was hospitalized Tuesday at a state hospital for a physical examination for the loss of muscle strength that he has seen in his legs, his family doctor said.
Fuhimori, 72, who was sentenced to 25 years in prison for human rights abuses committed during his rule (1990-2000), suffers from several diseases, including tongue cancer, for which he has undergone four surgeries and is under observation.
Congressman Alejandro Aginaga, who is his personal physician, told N TV that Fujimori will be examined in three days at the National Institute of Neoplastic Diseases to determine the cause of the pain and loss of strength in his lower extremities.
Aginag said that he thought Fuhimori should be a candidate for the benefit of a pardon for humanitarian reasons; however, he said he did not want this because he knows he is innocent.
He had undergone four surgeries for tongue cancer, lost 30 pounds [18 kg], and had other ailments, such as severe erosive gastritis, pancreatic cysts, kidney stones, high blood pressure, and leg circulation problems, the doctor said.
Fuhimori has been in prison since September 2007, in the National Police Special Operations Directorate.
In April 2009, he was sentenced to 25 years in prison for the murder of 25 people by the forces of the army extermination squad, which operated in secret during the early years of his rule.
Mujica is going to Mexico to strengthen political ties
An official delegation led by Uruguayan President José Mujica and comprising several ministers and businessmen will arrive this Tuesday with a visit to Mexico to expand trade between the two countries and to begin negotiations on political issues in the region.
Mujica will meet next Wednesday with his Mexican counterpart, Felipe Calderón, the most important item in a comprehensive plan to meet with political, business and community leaders in Mexico, according to a schedule released by Uruguay's leadership.
The two presidents' meeting in Guadalajara will be "a good opportunity to exchange information on the political relations between the two nations", the South American country's leadership said on its website.
According to local media, Mujica is seeking Calderon's support for Uruguay in the incident with France, which occurred when French President Nicolas Sarkozy included the South American country on the list of tax havens at the G20 meeting in the French city of Cannes.
In his speech, Sarkozy threatened to exclude from the international community those countries that remain tax havens, a statement that provoked protests from Uruguay and the recall of his ambassador to the European country for consultations.
Mexico has been chairing the G20 since November, a group of the most developed and developing countries, and has, in effect, had a tax information-sharing agreement with the South American country since January of this year to avoid double taxation.
The Uruguayan government has been trying in recent years to speed up the conclusion of tax exchange agreements to get off the "gray list" of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) of countries that do not use international standards for tax cooperation.
As for the trade plan, Mexico and Uruguay have had a Free Trade Agreement (FTA) in place since 2004, which has increased trade between the two countries.
The water main will be 3D with Super Mario 3D Land.
Super Mario has fought tirelessly for over 25 years to save Princess Peach from Bowser's evil clutches, but he's never done it in three dimensions before: in Super Mario 3D Land, he'll fight for a girl's love in stereoscopic technology.
The edition, which will be available in stores around the world this month, was designed with the specifications of the Nintendo 3DS handheld console in mind, which allows you to play in three dimensions without the need for glasses.
"Mario is the hero who has to tell how stereoscopy without glasses will work", said Nintendo's head of press in Spain, Omar Alvarez, during the game's presentation in Madrid.
Alvarez said that Super Mario 3D Land is "Nintendo's first video game specifically developed for this platform", because up until now successful products like Star Fox 64 3D or Zelda: Ocarina of Time 3D have been adaptations of existing games.
A Nintendo spokesperson stated that despite the existence of 3D, Super Mario 3D Land is an "accessible" video game that allows you to enjoy fast and mobile gameplay.
Alvarez said that Super Mario 3D Land contains two games in one: the first part is "simple" to attract less experienced users.
Once you start, most experts will go "round two" to the more challenging levels of the game.
In addition, users can choose in real time between "D aggressive" or one that only affects the depth of action, but which needs to be played in three dimensions to overcome various obstacles and "not succumb to optical illusions".
This three-dimensional invasion of Super Mario also marks the return of the character to the portable console, something that hasn't happened since 2005.
In this game, Nintendo winked at fans of the series and repeated the successful formula from previous games, a mustachioed plumber must walk across dangerous mined platforms to free Princess Peach.
However, the player will discover new moves, scenery, costumes and enemies, as well as the "playing" Luigi.
Colom guarantees the extradition of Portillo to the United States .
President Álvaro Colom said Tuesday that the extradition process for Alfonso Portillo has begun, so that he can answer in the United States for a $70 million money laundering conspiracy.
This is the end of the process by which Guatemala responded to a request from a northern country that demanded Portillo's extradition to stand trial there.
At a press conference, Kolom said his decision was due to the independence of the judicial and executive branches, given that the first instance court had already signed the extradition.
He claimed that during his tenure he had not "put his hands" on legal decisions and had taken all extradition procedures he had ever known.
Along with Portillo, Sergio Ruano Marroquin will be extradited for murder and grievous bodily harm, as well as Edgar Estrada Morales and Victor Estrada Paredes, both for drug trafficking.
What Colom did shows the execution process after all legal and constitutional courts were exhausted to prosecute the ex-head of state from 2000 to 2004.
In accordance with the decisions of the Fifth Criminal Court and the Constitutional Court (CC), Portillo will be extradited once with a decision on his legal status in Guatemala and a guarantee of his human rights.
Portillo was found not guilty of squandering Q120 million at the Ministry of Defence during the presidency, which was a process preceding his extradition, but the Ministry of Public Relations appealed and reopened the case.
Trinijove helped 6,000 young people from the risk group
The organization was created to prevent the marginalization of young people without education.
The results of the first 25 years of Trinijove's social support organisation are important: 6,000 young people who are vulnerable to social isolation have been helped to overcome difficult situations during this quarter of a century.
Add to that the hundreds of jobs created for this social group.
The anniversary was the occasion for the closing ceremony, held in the premises of the old Fabra I Coats factory, which was attended by over 300 people.
Trinijove was launched alongside the Trinity Vella in 1986 with the aim of helping young people with a lack of education, lack of work and drug problems or vulnerable to marginalization.
Yesterday's celebration in Sant Andreu brought together a large number of responsible organizations and institutions that have been cooperating with the association for 25 years.
The different political views during the election showed the unified nature of the work done by Trinijove.
After the Chairman of the General Authority, Arthur Massa, and his predecessor Horde Pujol, the ceremony was attended by ex-consultant of Socialist Education, Ernest Maragal, and ex-lieutenant mayor and current eco-socialist, municipal council member Ricardo Goma.
Fabra I Coats also featured current social welfare and family consultant, José Luis Clerice, and La Caixa's CEO of social work, Haume Lanaspa.
He said that Trinijove came into being at a very difficult time and that the current period is also difficult, but added that the work done so far "is a good foundation".
The chairman cited Trinijove as an example of fighting against bad circumstances and instilling hope in people experiencing difficulties.
"The crisis is not new to the organization and the work it has done", he said.
The building where the mass parties were held has been evacuated.
The invaders occupied 11 of the 13 floors of the building at 51 Balmes Street.
12 occupants left the building yesterday at noon without a fight
It seems that the nightmare of the neighbors living in 51 Balmes Street has come to an end.
Twelve people voluntarily left the building yesterday at noon, which they had illegally occupied and where they were organizing mass parties that irritated the neighbors, by court order without police intervention.
When the operation was over, the door locks were changed to prevent a repeat of the situation.
"From now on, there will be a traffic control", the manager said.
Squatters, who have taken 11 of the 13 floors of the building, have occupied the rest, seized all electricity and some water, painted the walls and left behind traces of various kinds, especially cans of alcoholic beverages.
The first three floors were the site of mass parties that lasted up to two days and irritated the owners.
Just behind the building is a nightclub, Balmes 51, which was also damaged.
The owner, Maria Pantinat, told Europa Press that since the building was occupied, her income has fallen by 80%.
The owner of the club says that the occupants of the building dragged her into an unfair competition, as they sold drinks for three euros, while in the club for 10.
In addition, the owner of the discotheque had to respond to neighbors' complaints about noise, although, as she noted, the noise was caused not by the club's visitors, but by the squatters and, above all, by those attending the parties that were organized there, the frequency and intensity of which increased, as the angry neighbors said.
The owner of the club said that the inconvenience was so great that she even reached an agreement with the owner of the property, and for nine months now he has been "forgiving" her rent.
City police also confirmed that they've received more complaints from neighbors about the situation in recent weeks.
The chairman of the PP municipal group, councillor Alberto Fernand Diaz, demanded last week "the immediate evacuation of the building to solve the problems of coexistence and common spirit that have arisen among the neighbors and the degradation in this area".
The popular leader explained that until the summer, only one floor of the building was occupied, but in the last few months squatters have invaded all floors and virtually every room and that some of them have been broken into.
In this sense, he added, "it is necessary to put an end to impunity and to resist the culturelessness that is being created in the building".
So, yesterday, police evacuated a building in New Barris.
At 3:30, police went to 35 Montreal Street after receiving a call from a neighbor who noticed four people entering the building.
Four were arrested immediately.
Park or mountain?
Architects agree to contest after disputes over dues
Municipal contest for 16 doors renewed debate on the role of Colcerola in Barcelona
In the mid-80s, during the rise of the now-defunct Capital Corporation of Barcelona (SCB), this administration printed promotional leaflets for Colserollas.
The booklet described the mountain as a large park in the capital city of Barcelona.
Moreover, it was accompanied by a comparison in the pictures with Central Park in New York.
With the death of the SCB, in 1987 the park once again took its place in the minds of many as the highest point of Barcelona as the capital of Catalonia, one of the few that is not oriented to the north-south, but up (mountain) -down (sea).
The positioning of Colserola as a nature park is contrary to this idea.
The prototype was not Central Park, but Yellowstone, with the wild boar as Yogi Bear.
This was until, in September, the council announced a huge competition consisting of 16 contests for many other gates in Colcerol.
The gates are the idea of the park, no doubt.
Either that or someone wants to put a goal on the field.
The question is, is it a park or a mountain?
The competition, and its organizational aspect, and its impact on the city, are a topic for discussion by all the architects of Barcelona.
This is probably the most common theme discussed when two members of this elite clan meet in an elevator.
And this fact leads to one of the few coincidences between what the three architects in Barcelona are saying and the scientists who were there.
Miguel Roldan, Daniel Modolo and Mara Bayona: the competition is appropriate
For Roldán, after reaching the coastline it becomes "necessary" to discuss the "front side of the mountain" when the proposal of Ildephon Serda, the mountain with the green apples, was not implemented.
"It must be admitted that the largest park in Barcelona is the beach.
Among other things, it's very accessible.
The Colserollas are more complex", says the architect, for whom the title "Colserollas Gate" contains a "verbal trap": we should not think of them "as an entrance to the park, but as a limitation of some areas where we have to act".
Modolo, like Roldán and Bayona with experience in urban planning, called the proposal an "intellectual challenge" with "some dangers".
The risks arising from the "uncertainty of predicting public space" after the experience of the 80s, which ended on the Forum site "with its own swan song".
The first fear is actually the limitation of the boundaries that we can build.
"Limiting something is preparing for the next step", meaning transition.
"We have to think about new urban planning tools because the current ones [as far as the Capital Master Plan (CMP) is concerned] can lead to real trouble".
More to the point, Modolo believes that the simplification of the Colserola Valley "can be understood as a park, Barcelona, not" as a purely topographical issue.
Modolo recalls that there is already work being done outside of Kalserola, which "should not be overlooked", although he is grateful for the opportunity the city offers his profession to join this project "from the beginning".
Moreover, he understands that the proximity of the mountain to the city is a pass that allows architects to enter into a debate, but "he doubts" whether this technical profile is what should guide the interdisciplinary teams ("success", he argues) that were supposed to create: "Architects should be only a tool".
Bayona hints that the answer to the question that gives the title to this piece is complex, since the rules of the competition lack the general view of the Colcerola: "There were announced 16 intersecting contests", he says, "in the sense of sea-mountain, but there is no longitudinal reading to see and understand the area as a whole".
That makes him, at least in his case, decide to enter 16 contests.
On the other hand, a design for one gate may intersect, by program and definition, with an architect's design for a neighboring gate.
From your point of view, the council must ensure that the strip directly above the Ronde de Dalt provides a complete area equipped to create a smooth transition between the city and the greenery.
The casino forgives Jonas Larrazabal and he will be released .
After 72 days of settlement, the Red Casino's attorney pardoned the brother of the mayor of Monterrey in a lawsuit against him for extortion.
After 72 days in prison, Manuel Jonas Larrazabal will be released after a legal representative for Red Casino granted him a pardon before the Second Criminal District Court, which is prosecuting the extortion of the mayor's brother.
After the Casino Royale bombing, Red Casino owner Sergio Gil Garcia published a series of photos and videos where allegedly Manuel Jonas demanded he pay an economic contribution so that the Monterrey authorities would allow a secret operation at the gambling house.
After the public condemnation, the State Attorney General opened a criminal case against the mayor's brother and on September 2 he was arrested and imprisoned for 30 days.
After four hours in front of a State Ministry of Inheritance Crime agent, he was sent to a temporary prison located in the old part of the state capital.
He stayed there for 49 days, following the instructions of the second restraining order after the prosecutor ruled out bribery and organized crime.
On October 19, he was transferred to Cadereita for allegedly extorting half a million pesos from the owner of the Red Casino, but he only spent a few hours there in a medium-security prison because he was threatened with death.
The authorities allowed him to continue serving his sentence in the municipal prison at San Nicolas in Garza.
On October 25, an arrest warrant was issued by the clerk of the Second Criminal District Court, Jorge Janes, who said that after almost two months of investigation, there was enough evidence of Jonas' guilt, such as the fact that he had charged 1.5 million pesos from bookmakers in exchange for clearing the operation.
On Monday, the legal representative of Red Casino, Victor Aldo García Gómez, appeared before Judge José Luis Pesina to ask for a pardon for the brother of the mayor of the region, so that in the next few hours he could be released.
During the trial, the state prosecutor in the trial, Ramiro Arias, asked Garcia Gomez if he had compensated for the damage and which of the gambling house's partners were granting a pardon, although the lawyer tried not to name him.
Based on record 197/2011, a legal pardon was granted to Jonas Larrasabal, and after that no statements can be made about the trial that was planned against him; nor will any compensation or punishment be sought.
After a hearing of the legal representative of the bookmakers, at almost 15:50 it was ordered to release Larrasabal Breton immediately.
The court clerk, Jorge Janes, went to the San Nicolas Municipal Prison in Garza to inform Jonah that he was legally pardoned and his case would be closed.
He'll also notify him of an immediate release order signed by the judge.
Minister Dionicio Perez Hakome gives details of the disaster, which killed Interior Minister Francisco Blake and seven others.
The Ministry of Communications and Transport (MST) said that the results of the accident, which killed Interior Minister Francisco Blake Mora and seven others, showed that the helicopter hit the ground in complete integrity, without the pilot attempting an emergency landing.
During a press conference, Dionisio Pérez Hacomé, Minister of Communications and Transport, said that before the aircraft took off, the pilot found out that the weather conditions were suitable for the flight.
"Elements that appear to indicate the ship had multiple ground contact, wings touching trees at 25 metres, where the craft lost its fuselage".
He also said that the ship was intended for 19 people, and that it met the requirements for transporting people.
He also said that the studies conducted in the area of impact did not report the presence of any parts on the ground.
"The investigation reports that there are no components of the ship elsewhere, the impact occurred in a state of structural integrity.
"The helicopter was intended for 19 passengers, which satisfied the relevant requirements of passenger transportation.
The earth at this point is tilted by seven to 30 degrees.
At this point, the secretary said, the key is to get results as soon as possible; however, the study may take several months or even a year.
Meanwhile, Gilberto Lopez Meyer, the director general of Airports and Emergency Services, said the presidential helicopter was cruising at cruising speed at the time of the crash and that it happened on soft rising ground.
"This information reinforces the hypothesis of a conventional flight maneuver at the time of impact", he said.
At a press conference, SCT owner Perez Hakome listed six important elements in the investigation:
Visual flight:
According to aviation regulations, the flight was operated under visual flight rules, which means that the crew must have visual visibility during flight and landing.
Weather conditions:
AICM reports identified suitable conditions for takeoff as the aircraft headed to the border area between Mexico City and the State of Mexico, where layers of low-altitude clouds were observed.
The selected routes:
It's possible that the cloud cover caused the team to look for a lower elevation and more visible area in the Cuernavaca Valley.
The hit.
The impact coordinates and the last radar recording of the aircraft match, so there was probably no loss of control or change of direction before the impact.
The scattered debris in a small area:
The information available so far indicates that the impact was on the front and the flanks.
The scattered debris suggests the helicopter hit the ground in a structural integrity condition.
No obvious signs of fire or explosion were detected:
In the area of the crash, there is uncovered evidence of a shipwreck, some kind of explosion or fire.
Recent research suggests there may have been multiple ground contacts.
During the work on the site, pieces of the aircraft were found at an altitude of 9,200 feet above sea level, the land has an inclination of seven degrees to 30 degrees.
The images show the sequence in which it was destroyed along the way.
The information contains facts that seem to indicate that the helicopter may have had several collisions with the ground.
After a thorough search of a larger area than the delineated area near the crash site, no scattered parts of the aircraft were found, reinforcing the assumption that the impact occurred in a structural integrity condition.
MSS announces the obesity gene search program
Social Protection is leading a study to find the gene for obesity in children and young people; it is supported by specialists from IPN
The Mexican Social Security Institute (MSSI) announced that it is conducting a study to detect the gene of obesity in children and young adults, which has been called the "Childhood and Adolescent Obesity Genetics Protocol", which will provide a count of the signs associated with being overweight.
In his statement, Miguel Cruz Lopez, head of the Biochemistry Division of the Specialized Hospital of the National Medical Center of the XXI Century, explained that a multidisciplinary team of therapists, nurses, dietitians and social workers had been assembled.
The team is assisted by specialists and graduate students from the National Institute of Health (NIPH) and the Center for Scientific Research and Higher Education (CINVESTAV) of the National Polytechnic Institute (NPI).
The public, whether prescribed or not, is invited to participate by visiting participating MSSI sports centers in the Valley of Mexico, where testing will be conducted with children every Saturday morning at 8:00 a.m.
He stressed that the protocol was started at the sports center in Cuauhtémoc (in the west of Mexico City), and since October 8 the events have been held at the sports center in Nesahualco (east of Mexico City).
After the goal of 500 to 600 children is reached, the study will continue at Independence Sports Center (south of Mexico City) and finally at Morelos Sports Center (north of Mexico City).
He explained that the goal of this study was to understand the components and importance of genetics in the development of obesity and to establish a risk factor among children and adolescents in Mexico to prevent the development of chronic degenerative diseases.
November 14 will be World Diabetes Day, and the main goal is to gather three thousand children and adolescents aged 6 to 14 with the permission and supervision of their parents to fill out individual nutrition questionnaires.
They will also be asked about their physical activity and family history of hereditary diseases to avoid risk factors that lead to diseases such as diabetes or kidney failure.
He explained that Saturday will be anthropometric measurements of all participants (weight, height and waist span), measurement of blood pressure and glucose, fat, cholesterol and insulin levels and genetic analysis (to identify genes that are associated with childhood obesity).
Cruz Lopez said the study reflects the concern of health professionals about the alarming weight gain among children.
Medical studies conducted between 1999 and 2006 show that in just 6 years, there was an increase: 77 percent of boys were obese, 47 percent of girls; and there was a significant increase in overweight", said the MSSI specialist.
He said the rationale for searching for markers was based on the fact that the country's population is different from other peoples in its genetic history.
He reported that the average Mexican is 65 percent American Indian, 30 percent European, and five percent African, and that condition has been reflected in genes that are associated with diabetes and obesity.
He explained that obesity is largely a genetic result of the body's inability to burn the excess energy we consume, and it is stored as fat.
The immediate benefit, the researcher explained, was that the children were given a comprehensive assessment that could reveal whether they were overweight or obese.
Even, he said, the presence of dark folds on the neck and forearms indicates the possibility of metabolic disorders and even prediabetes.
The information is treated with all confidentiality, the doctors give it in writing to the parents, and they explain to them all the dimensions and lifestyle changes that must be made to avoid the disease.
Cruz López explained that there are three main causes of overweight, obesity, and other chronic diseases: sedentary lifestyle, or lack of daily physical activity, spending most of the day at home in front of the TV, and using short distances of transportation instead of walking.
This is also due to high calorie intake, i.e. increased consumption of sugary drinks and carbohydrates (tamale, bread, pizza, hamburgers, etc.) with high fat and protein content and genetic predisposition, analyzed in this program.
UNAM asphalt will be able to avoid cracks
Raphael Herrera, a researcher at the UNAM chemistry department, has developed a polymer-modified bitumen to produce a mixture of the highest quality, resistant to environmental and temperature impacts.
If the signals sent by the road surface were taken into account, about 200,000 holes would need to be repaired each rainy season in the metropolitan area of the Valley of Mexico, says Rafael Herrera Najera, a researcher at the UNAM chemistry department, adding that if the process of building and maintaining the paved road surface is correct, the number of holes could be reduced or even reduced to zero.
In his lecture Technological View of Pits, delivered as part of the International Year of Chemistry, it is reported that the laboratory for which he is responsible is developing a polymer-modified bitumen for the production of a mixture with characteristics similar to bitumen, but with better resistance at both high and low temperatures.
Herrera Nahera said that this type of modified bitumen could be used in places where the weather is extremely hot, such as some cities in the north, to improve the quality of roads and therefore prevent pit formation.
He explained that bitumen, the heaviest part of oil, is a sequence of hydrocarbon molecules, one of high molecular weight called asphaltene and the other of low molecular weight called malten, which together give the road surface its characteristic viscous elastic behavior.
The viscous behavior of bitumen is that at high temperatures of about 180 degrees it behaves like a liquid, at 120 it is very viscous, and at 50 degrees Celsius it remains almost solid, while at very low temperatures it becomes brittle, he said.
This means that the resistance of street asphalt is not constant, but changes during the day, depending on natural conditions and temperature, said a chemical engineer.
The chemistry scientist noted that the streets of Mexico City are mostly covered with a flexible coating, which is made up of six layers of material, the last three of which include bitumen.
Among the uppermost layers is bitumen, which is made up of small stones that are lowered into the bitumen and then pressed.
Every stone that makes up this coating, he said, is dipped in bitumen.
When vehicles are moving and putting in effort, it helps the forces to be very well distributed across the road surface.
If it were modified asphalt, they would be even better distributed, said the chemical engineer.
On the asphalt surface, he added, there is a last layer, which is called the wear layer, which is made of fine stone, actually sand also submerged in the asphalt.
Since it is a layer that will contact the wheels of the vehicle, it must have greater resistance than the asphalt surface and provide road friction.
As part of the road surface that will receive and distribute the applied forces, the wear layer also requires proper thickness, and the material from which it is made must be taken into account.
Weather, especially humidity and temperature fluctuations, are also very important factors to consider, especially water, he said, because it significantly affects the condition of the asphalt.
When the soil is wet, water enters the coating and it is difficult for it to get out, this causes the softening of all the coating layers and therefore the formation of pits.
When a pit is formed, he said, the first thing is the wear and tear layer and then it affects the bitumen, but the damage doesn't happen instantly, which is a process that should be taken into account at the first signs of ongoing repair programs.
The member of the National Research System also explained that the transport load is another important factor in the formation of holes, and therefore the thickness of each coating layer should always be related to the transport load and it is necessary to guarantee the fulfillment of this requirement to prevent the frequent appearance of holes.
Raphael Herrera said that there was still much to be done about bitumen, and that bitumen emulsions, for example, were already on the market in other countries and even helped to repair pits easily and without using high temperatures.
What was the Valli candidate missing to become the next Miss Colombia?
An analysis of the reasons that prevented Serena Melina Ramirez from winning the Miss Colombia crown.
The representative of Vallee has received the title of princess 14 times.
Once again, Valli del Caucus has only to wish to win the Miss Colombia crown.
This time Melina Ramirez Serna had to be content with being on the podium with a silver crown and a ribbon proclaiming her the new princess of Colombia.
With the result achieved last night in Cartagena, where Miss Atlantic won the crown and the scepter, the department now has 14 titled princesses, and Melina joins the legion of women from Val del Cauc who were close to the crown but were declared princesses, among them Mirias Ospina Benoit (1947), Clara Borreiro Domínguez (1949), Patricia Belini Ayala (1979), Lorena Álvarez (1981), Rose Marie Alsate (1983), Olga Maria Arenas (1987), Leila Blanque (1988), Monica Evers (1989), Sonsola Maria Piñera (1990), Diana Isabel (1993), Alceu Garcia (2000), Catalina (2007), and Alceu Garcia (2008). This is the first time that the department has been named after a woman.
The question that many people are asking now:
What's missing? Because the result is the defeat of the top favorite, who in every performance has shown that she has everything to be the next Miss Colombia, not just the fact that she was voted the Queen of Police and the Most Beautiful Face by Vogue -- titles that were held by queens like Tatiana Vargas or Natalia Navarro, who won the Miss Colombia crown.
The first factor in the jury's decision to award her the title of First Princess was that she could not convincingly answer the question "What book characterizes you and why?" posed by Martin Muriel Gomez of the Let's Read Society.
She said to the questioner:
"I read a lot, I believe in literature, I think it's a form of occultism, and I definitely think the book that characterizes my childhood, The Little Prince, is a pretty profound book.
Today I'm reading Crime and Punishment, a masterpiece of world literature that we should all read, and right now I'm reading Irina Nemirovskaya, a Russian writer, a wonderful book called The Blood Fever.
The answer that the jury didn't like was because of the term "occulturing" and, secondly, because it didn't explain specifically how each of the books cited characterized it.
But after the ceremony, Melina said she was calm and happy with her result: "the universe is wise, what happens is what should happen".
And you all, please read a little bit, "The Little Prince" is a great book".
Among the hypotheses voiced, Vallee was burned by favoritism.
A reporter from Bogotá suggested that because she was favored, she was greeted with applause, and was the candidate who won all the preliminary awards (Ostera's culinary competition, the audience vote for the best national costume, and the Queen Mother), "which aroused the jealousy of the other candidates, provoked stress in the queen, and as a result she did not shine on stage".
And it was noted during her first swimsuit appearance at Hilton Beach and during her two performances at the evening coronation.
Although she looked confident in both, it was noticeable that she lacked the strength and energy that representatives of Magdalena and Atlantico had demonstrated.
Ariel Osorio, a reporter for RCN's "Like at Home" programme, said that the fact that Milena was named a princess "means that the candidate who wins the most awards during the competition does not become queen".
Also, Valerie's representative has been avoiding the press lately, and that was wrong.
Another hypothesis is that Valerie failed to convince the jury of her interest in social work, which is ultimately the essence of the National Beauty Contest.
That's why, two days before the election, international jury member Lucy Doty said they were looking for a woman committed to the social needs of her country.
"Some beauty is not enough for Miss Colombia, we have to look beyond appearance, but we have to focus on the public consciousness, before they take part in the competition, they have to be involved in the projects", she said.
There is also speculation that representative Vallière was guilty of defects on her buttocks and fibrosis that was visible on her abdomen, but this is disputed, as the jury specifically noted her as a candidate with "natural beauty", taking into account her healthier body, good nutrition and responsible physical work.
The king's adviser, Jorge Hernán Orozco, notes that Melina had a better body, "but fibrosis problems in her abdomen, which were not very noticeable to me, made her lose her glasses on the last day".
Meanwhile, journalist Guido Oíos of Kromos magazine believes that the mistake of the representative of Valle de Cauc was that she underwent surgery.
"The operations are good, but the representative Valliere doesn't know how to do them.
Her body was never her advantage, and here she was punished for it.
As for the prize, which was first awarded by the organizers of the National Beauty Contest, a cruel prophecy came true last night, saying that it was a stallion that Raimundo gave to Melina as compensation for losing the pleasure of winning the crown.
Believe it or not, the fact is that today is Melina's year of reign, not as queen, but as princess, a position that allows her to represent Colombia in one of the international competitions, as specified directly by the organizers of the National Competition.
However, she will go down in history as one of the queens who, despite her excellent performance at the Cartagena contest, faced difficulties in obtaining the crown.
That was the work of the man who identified Alfonso Cano's body.
The Cali forensic scientist went down in history as the man who confirmed the death of Alfonso Cano.
The work of these employees is key.
On November 4, CTI forensic scientist Cali made history as the person who confirmed the identity of FARC leader Alfonso Cano by matching his fingerprints.
Seven forensic scientists working at CTI are on duty this week to investigate Eleazar Gonzalez, a man from Puerto Tejada who has spent 21 years in the field of forensic investigation.
Early in his career, Gonzalez worked in the cities of Choco, where he often had to travel more than five days through the jungle to reach the location of bodies that needed to be identified.
In 2000 he moved to the Valley and after completing the corresponding courses he became a specialist in the field of criminology, where he studied the friction of the skin, i.e. palms and soles.
During the week of Elizardo's operation to identify the man known as Alfonso Cano, he was told to wear clothes for no more than three days.
Something big was coming.
He flew in from Kauka to Palmyra on Friday night.
He knew he'd have to identify two bodies, and one of them was supposed to belong to the man who led the world's oldest guerrilla war, so they asked him to take ten pictures of the fingerprints of Guillermo León Saenz (his real name).
However, when he arrived with the research team at the site of the body, he did not identify it by its appearance; it was very different from what was shown in the media.
He was beardless, dressed like a local farmer, without glasses, and considerably thinner.
But the prints don't lie.
Using magnifying glass, ink, a shovel, and a flashlight, Eliezer matched the body's fingerprints to those in the photographs.
His eyes did not disappoint: it was Alfonso Cano.
That same night, a representative of Puerto Tejada was asked to confirm to Defense Minister Juan Carlos Pinson that it was the head of the RVSC.
Fingerprint searching is now complete .
For the specialist in dactyloscopy of the Sijin unit from Cali, the recognition received from President Juan Manuel Santos by Elizaro González at a press conference on the operation against Cano is particularly significant.
A lot of people don't know what we do.
Dactyloscopy is a rigorous, error-free science, and it can play a key role in solving crimes.
In addition to identifying bodies, fingerprint specialists are involved in the investigation of crimes such as theft and murder, and they identify those arrested.
Many criminals are caught with fake IDs or no IDs.
We're taking their prints and running them through the database.
The investigator said that in the case of theft, he had to remove a piece of the wall of the house because that was where the thief leaned his hands to get hold of a safe full of jewelry and money.
"Walls are difficult to work with because they are not a convenient surface for fingerprinting, but in this case we can take a picture of the entire palm and identify the criminal who participated in several thefts", he says.
Prints also help rule out or establish involvement of suspects in homicide-related cases.
A man was recently found dead with a bottle of liquor around him.
The investigation determined that a relative could have been suspected of the crime and, in fact, the fingerprints on the bottle were the same.
While that doesn't guarantee he was the killer, it does prove he was at the scene of the murder.
The CTI fingerprint specialist explained that where there are fingerprints, a chemical or physical reagent is applied.
When they appear, a shovel or tape is used to remove them.
Then the fingerprint pictures are sent to Asif, which is a criminal database, or they're entered into the registry.
"The problem is that we still have a lot of undocumented Colombians", the CTI expert said.
He explained that things weren't as they were on the CSI show.
Just as not all that glitters is gold, not everything you touch leaves a mark.
However, if possible, a comparison is made.
Angry People are challenging New York City authorities
Hundreds of protesters camped out in front of Zuccotti Square.
Some of the protesters listened to the court's decision to disperse the demonstration from the square and headed to the neighboring park.
Occupy Wall Street members challenged New York City authorities on Tuesday when they tried to infiltrate Manhattan Square under a court order, from where they were evacuated at dawn in an attempt to take over another Big Apple Park.
Hundreds of protesters gathered in Zuccotti Square, where they wanted to go thanks to a court order that allowed "angry people" to camp in the square, while another part of the movement responded to the crackdown by seizing a park in the north of the city, where further arrests were made.
"Our idea is that since the court won't allow us to camp in the square, we'll camp somewhere else and continue the legal fight for the return of Zuccotti and through peaceful sit-ins and demonstrations", said Mark Bray, a spokesman for the Occupy Wall Street movement.
Bray explained that the "angry people's" response to the tent city evacuation, which was ordered by New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, went to court, where Judge Lucy Billings issued an order prohibiting forced evacuation from the square and allowing protesters to remain in the camp.
In addition, the "angry men" have begun to seize a new park located at the intersection of Central Canal Street and Sixth Avenue, near the entrance to the Holland Tunnel, which connects New York and New Jersey, and is owned by the parish of Trinity Church.
They could have occupied the place for at least an hour, but then the police arrived and began arresting some of the protesters, although Brey could not say the exact number, but told Efe that he saw several journalists who were also in handcuffs.
The organization says several hundred people were camped out at the site where the delegation of religious leaders had gone to show support for the movement's members, trying to act as a mediator in negotiations with the police.
Meanwhile, Zuccotti Square, which is privately owned, remains closed pending a court hearing scheduled for Tuesday to consider the legality of this morning's dispersal of protesters.
Some of the protesters who were on their way there were carrying and distributing copies of the court order at the same time and even giving these copies to the police guarding the square, which led to "some small clashes", said Bray, who said some police beat the protesters.
The court order prohibits authorities from evacuating Occupy Wall Street members and forcing "laws that were enacted after the takeover, or prohibiting protesters from re-entering the park with shops and other property that was previously used".
Mayor Bloomberg told reporters that because of the court order, the city suspended the opening of public spaces and the protesters were informed, but local laws prevent them from opening tent shops and sleeping bags again.
A municipal council member personally justified the removal of protesters from Zuccotti Square at dawn, an operation that resulted in about 200 arrests, and the decision was made because the protesters "violated the law".
Bloomberg said he ordered the square to be cleared because it was becoming "a place where people came not to protest but to break the law and, in some cases, to harm other people", as "some businesses were threatened" and neighbors feared "a deterioration in the quality of life".
The evacuation this morning was disgusting and shows that deep down, Bloomberg is more interested in protecting the financial interests of American workers", added a spokesman for the movement, which condemns the mayor for "disrespecting freedom of speech".
Occupy Wall Street officials also indicated that they plan to hold "grand rallies" on Thursday in partnership with civil society organizations and unions to commemorate the last two months of protests that began on September 17.
Pamela Anderson is going to be the Virgin Mary in a Christmas TV special.
Along with Michael Bublé and other prominent Canadians, she will appear on the television program "Russell Peters Christmas" on December 1.
Canadian Pamela Anderson was Tim Allen's assistant in "The Great Repair", a lifeguard in "The Malibu Saviors", Bunny in "Playboy", the wife of rock musician Tommy Lee, and now the actress and model will be the Virgin Mary in a Christmas special on Canadian television.
The private CTV channel announced today that Anderson, along with crooner Michael Bublé and other prominent Canadians, will appear on the December 1st episode of Russell Peters' Christmas, playing the very special Maria.
CTV today released footage of a television show in which Anderson, also known for a widely circulated Internet home pornographic video in which she appears with her then-husband, Mötley Crüe drummer Tommy Lee, dressed as the Virgin Mary, holding a doll in a manger depicting Jesus.
In this scene, Peters, a well-known Canadian comedian of Indian origin who recently performed as the host of Charlie Sheen's My Cruel Torpedo Truth tour, appears as Joseph.
In addition to Anderson and Peters, the CTV Christmas special features Canadian singer Bublé, who married Argentine model Louisiana Lopilato in Buenos Aires in late March and who also knows how to handle scandals.
Bublé recently called American Kim Kardashian a "bitch" during one of his concerts in New York.
Japan, rebuilt after the earthquake
GDP grew by 1.5% thanks to domestic consumption, ending the downturn that began in March.
Since March of last year, the Japanese economy has been paralyzed and is still recovering from the devastating earthquake that led to the nuclear crisis, the worst disaster the Land of the Rising Sun has suffered since World War II.
The Tokyo government's initial estimate of the material losses was $300 billion - a blow that seems to be passing despite the difficult world situation.
After three consecutive losing quarters, the data on gross domestic product from July to September definitely helped turn the page: GDP grew by 1.5% compared to the previous quarter and by 6% year-on-year.
The second quarter, the Japanese fiscal year starting in March 2012, also represents the fastest growth from January to March 2010.
The revival may be partly explained by the revival of the purchase of machinery to rebuild areas devastated by the earthquake and subsequent tsunami.
In fact, companies increased their investments by 1.1% against the 0.9% decline in capital expenditures that was observed from January to March, the first decline after six months of uninterrupted growth.
But the real breakthrough in the Japanese economy is not based solely on the Keynesian impulse, which calls for using the crisis to strengthen - or restructure - infrastructure, using gaps to grow from scratch.
Japan has awakened, largely due to the growth of household consumption, which now accounts for 60% of Japanese GDP.
This figure rose by 1% due to the increase in spending on cars, travel and leisure.
The yen is stamped
Tokyo gave the domestic market, when the yen, the Japanese currency, became one of the "safe haven currencies" chosen by investors who want to get rid of the eurozone debt crisis and negative forecasts for the US, a privilege that presses like a rock on the accounts of exporting companies.
With a stronger currency, products are expensive abroad, a major blow to a country whose economic course is determined by the health of big tech companies.
Toyota or Sony, for example, blame the yen for their low performance from July to September.
As markets continue to besiege the peripheral EU countries, the government of Yeshihiko Noda is not letting up on its vigilance.
We must be alert to the ongoing risks such as the deterioration of some foreign economies, the impact of the flooding in Thailand and the sharp rise in the value of the yen, said Economic Policy Minister Motohisa Furukawa yesterday.
And the prospects are not encouraging.
The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) reported that most of the participating countries showed clear signs of a slowdown in economic activity in September.
The indicator, which predicts disruptions in the global economy, showed that the main forces are slowing.
It then fell by four tenths to 100.4 points from 100.8 in August.
The eurozone even fell below the average, which is at 100 points, after it plunged by eight tenths to 99.13 points.
Athens is once again giving ground to doubt
Papademos said the amendment would be approved, but the Conservatives would not sign any written commitments.
With peripheral risk rewards and uncertainty reigning in the parks, Greece continues to wander through the maze that leads to a way out of the great European debt crisis.
The feeling that the "consent" of the new transitional government of Ellada is imposed by the demands of Brussels rather than by the true conviction of political forces is beginning to be confirmed by the facts.
While new Prime Minister Lucas Papademos warned yesterday that there is no alternative to structural reforms and that the 100-day period agreed upon when he was appointed may not be enough to implement them, the leader of the conservative New Democracy party, Antonis Samaras, assures that he will not support the new austerity measures in any way and has again repeated his demand for new elections scheduled for February 19.
The main task of the current government is to implement the decisions taken at the October 26 summit, Papademos said yesterday, opening the parliamentary debate that will culminate tomorrow with a vote of confidence in the new executive.
A package of 24 programmes to increase employment, reform the civil service disciplinary code and new measures to combat tax evasion will be the first innovations.
However, Samaras' message does not clear up any doubts about his position: "We are ready to help the transitional government, but we do not promise anything".
The Conservative leader has gone one step further in his sentiments towards the EU and the IMF, the organizations that should unfreeze the 8 billion euros that Athens urgently needs, and has made it clear that he will not give his approval to any letter of agreement to the treaty's requirements.
But the European Commission, still irritated by the effect of Papandreou's all-or-nothing referendum, reiterated yesterday that its demands are unequivocal: it will not resume aid unless the new government and the leaders of Greece's main parties sign "a written agreement without any ambiguity and as soon as possible".
Economy Ministry spokesman Amadeu Altafay said the troika's inspectors could return to Athens "very soon" to discuss with the new government "what should be done to pay the sixth tranche" of $8,000 million, although an exact date has not yet been set.
There's enough thread in the Greek club for a while.
"These are tools of progress and hope".
The Queen has stressed Spain's "primary" position with regard to this type of finance.
Spain "has been a world leader in microfinance".
Queen Sophia recalled yesterday that over the past two decades the country has become the second largest donor in terms of cooperation instruments, the "essence" of which, she said, is that it is "an instrument of social progress, justice and hope for a better future for all humanity, based on faith in people".
The Queen opened the Fifth World Microcredit Summit in Valladolid yesterday, saying that "there is no doubt" that such actions are "absolutely necessary" to achieve the Millennium Development Goals set by the United Nations by 2015, "especially with a view to halving the number of people living on less than a dollar a day, the level at which the poverty line is being set".
Spain is "still working" to expand the network of recipients around the world and is taking this task on with all "responsibility", says Doña Sofia, hoping that the efforts and achievements that emerged during the summit, which will last until Thursday, will "ensure the creation of new capacities and better opportunities for the poorest people and especially for women", the main recipients of these loans.
There are "many achievements" and "many difficulties we face".
The microcredit summit is not only a forum for debate, but also a platform that promotes "two main goals".
So Her Majesty explained that she hoped that by the end of 2015, 175 million poor families would have benefited from these financial services and 100 million of those households would have risen out of poverty.
The impetus for the creation of a microcredit system in Spain and the rest of the world "has followed the path started years ago" by Muhammad Yunus, Ms. Sofia stressed, as "an act of justice and recognition".
And she described the founder of this tool as "a striking idealist in the universal cause of poverty", whose work has been known for 15 years, since the time the queen went to Bangladesh to study his lending policies on the ground.
This experience was adopted a year later at the first World Summit in Washington and other meetings such as those held in Ivory Coast in 1999, Canada in 2006, and "everywhere I saw continuous development", said Her Majesty, whose connection to this project earned her yesterday the title of "head of the family" assembled in Valladolid "the banker of the poor".
Finally, Queen Sophia concluded her speech by calling on the audience to participate in the discussion and find solutions to move forward in the fight against poverty.
"Ethical imperative" is a good one.
Trinidad's Foreign Minister Jiménez said that solidarity is an "ethical imperative" for every democratic state.
In this regard, she said it would be a mistake to associate cooperation with developing countries with times of economic boom, as it is a "permanent obligation".
Jimenez concluded that microcredit implies "a serious and firm course toward poverty eradication", and that now "more than ever" governments in developed countries must work in solidarity and not allow it to fall victim to spending cuts.
For Spain, microcredit is "one of the main areas of development cooperation".
The Secretary of State for International Cooperation, Soraya Rodriguez, praised the "success" in giving "assurance" to the "disadvantaged, before whom all doors are closed", and the mayor of Valladolid Francisco Javier León de la Riva welcomed all those present in the city, which "opens its doors, surrounded by the spirit of solidarity".
CDU proposes to elect the European Commission chairman by universal suffrage
The first day of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) congress in Leipzig on Monday, November 14, was without significant problems for Chancellor Angela Merkel, who is also chair of the Christian Democratic Party.
The future of Europe was not originally planned in the programme, but it emerged in the autumn itself, in particular to satisfy activists who believe that the government's policy is far from being as strict as it should be today with Greece and perhaps tomorrow with Italy....
The draft resolution on the Presidency of the European Commission, put to the vote by the leadership, was adopted almost unanimously.
Of the 1001 delegates, only nine voted against and ten abstained.
The standing ovations, which lasted several minutes, and which were deserved by Angela Merkel and a few hours later by Wolfgang Schäuble, the Euro-Philosopher and Finance Minister, left no room for doubt.
The basic idea of the Chancellor and the draft resolution is expressed in the slogan: the right answer to the crisis is "not less Europe, but more Europe".
Not only because Europe means peace, but because "nine million jobs depend directly on the euro".
For the chancellor, "it's time for a breakthrough in Europe".
This could mean changes to the Lisbon Treaty, making it possible for the European Union to strengthen its control over the financial policies of the eurozone countries, but it could also affect the election of the European Commission president by universal suffrage, "to give Europe a face".
Anyway, this is one of the draft resolutions passed by Congress, which obviously was the brainchild of Wolfgang Schäuble.
Of course, it is unlikely that 27 countries will quickly agree to this decision; the UK is against it, and the CDU leaders believe that Nicolas Sarkozy is against it as well.
But the soil is ready.
Similarly, the delegates overwhelmingly rejected the proposal to weigh the vote of each EU member country on the board of the European Central Bank in accordance with the size of their economies, which would significantly increase the weight of the German economy.
Wishing to calm the mood in her party, the chancellor increased the number of references to Konrad Adenauer and Helmut Kohl, but she did not seek to influence the congress at the expense of "small" European countries or countries in difficulty who like to criticize "high-minded" Germany.
Although the draft resolution on Europe has a whole paragraph on the importance of "German-French friendship", Angela Merkel did not mention France.
Just passing through.
Recalling that two centuries ago Leipzig was the scene of a bloody battle.
In fact, it was one of the most humiliating defeats of Napoleon's army.
What is a medical records fraud?
Following the cash benefits, UMP and the government began an offensive on the hospital records.
On November 15, Nicolas Sarkozy will arrive in Bordeaux to visit the family benefit fund and give a speech on the issue, which has been raised periodically since 2007, of fighting social welfare fraud.
And to help this offensive, which is driven by the desire to save money in a difficult situation, but also part of the right-wing re-election campaign, the majority wants to focus on hospital records.
First, in a budget-saving move, the government intends to impose a fourth day of unpaid leave on private company employees before the start of benefits.
Obviously, without the specific consent of the employer, the sick worker will lose his/her salary in four days, equal to at least 15% of his/her monthly income.
A measure that threatens to generate a storm of anger, but which Les Echos reports will save 280 million euros.
And that will be accompanied by other measures with a more symbolic effect, namely imposing on public servants one day without paying sickness benefit (public servants have not yet had to wait for the payment of the benefit, unlike the three-day wait for private sector employees).
Now, when these issues are discussed, the majority also re-raises the issue of fraud, referring to misuse of hospital records.
The control will be tougher and in addition, if you are caught, you will have to return all the illegal payments you have received", warned Xavier Bertran on RTL on Saturday, November 13.
As in other cases, the effect of the claim was somewhat disproportionate to the actual abuse of hospital records.
They have indeed been under constant scrutiny and political attack since 2002, which has paid off.
People in France are not sick more than anywhere else in Europe.
Let's look at the numbers by country first.
According to the National Health Insurance Fund (CNAM), more than 237 million euros of daily compensation was paid out in 2006.
According to the Institute for Health Economics Research and Documentation, daily compensation costs of 11.3 billion euros in 2008 amounted to 5% of total health expenditure.
Of this amount, 46% was for maternity leave and work accidents and 54% for sickness benefits, which amounted to 6.2 thousand million euros.
And so, they accounted for 2.5% of health-related spending.
The French spent an average of 14.5 days in hospital beds in 2010 compared to 17.8 days in 2009, according to a study by Alma Consulting Group.
The arithmetic mean, which hides some of the deviations; another study published in 2007 by career management website Monster.com, showed that 75% of the 40,000 French workers surveyed said they had not taken a single day off from work.
Another study, this time on health insurance, claims that in 2010 37% of hospital stays lasted less than 8 days, 15% from 15 days to one month, 15% from one to three months and 11% longer.
If we compare these figures with those of our European neighbours, we see that French workers are no more likely to take sick leave than workers in any other country.
A long-term study conducted in 2010 by two CNRS researchers showed that between 1994 and 2001 the overall proportion of absenteeism in France (whether for health reasons or not) ranged between 10% and 11%, compared with 20-28% in Denmark, 15% in the United Kingdom and 16-18% in the Netherlands.
The rate of fraud involving medical records is very low compared to the gray employment.
As for the fraud rate, it's very low.
The tightening of the law after 2002 led to systematic checks on hospitals lasting more than 45 days.
In 2008, out of 1.5 million cases checked, CNAM found that 13% of the 285,000 short-term illness conclusions were "unjustified" or too long", which is 37,050 cases.
In the case of systematically checked medical records for more than 45 days, 11 percent of the 1.2 million cases were found to be "inappropriate or unfounded", or 132,000.
In all, 169,000 cases were "unfounded" on the basis of several million workers who received sick leave.
Figures that show very few cases compared to, say, the gray employment numbers.
According to UMP MP Dominique Tiana, author of a report on the issue in June, they amount to between 9 and 15 thousand million euros of unreceived budget revenue per year, which is more than the total cost of daily compensation, and therefore infinitely higher than the losses from fraud.
Papademos: Greece must follow the new settlement plan
Greece needs a new settlement program to save its economy.
Prime Minister Lucas Papademos said in parliament on Monday, November 14, adding that the 100 days his coalition government had been given were not enough to complete the task.
"To achieve the goal of saving the economy, we need the support of our European partners and a new budget adjustment program", said the head of government, who made his first public statement opening a confidence vote debate in parliament on Wednesday.
The implementation of the decisions taken at the Eurozone summit on October 27 should be the "main task" of the new government, as the country's presence in the Eurozone is "put on the map", he added.
Accordingly, Papademos predicts a reduction of the country's budget deficit "to about 9%" of GDP by the end of the year, from 10.6% in 2010 and 15.7% in 2009.
Rightists reject new government measures
On Monday, right-wing leader Antonis Samaras expressed support for measures already taken to try to get out of the debt crisis, but warned that his party would not support further austerity measures.
"We will not vote for new measures", he said at a meeting with lawmakers from his New Democracy party.
He expressed his agreement with the tasks of reducing deficits and debts and fighting waste, but also his rejection of any course that impedes the recovery of the economy.
Olli Reno, the European Commissioner for Economics and Finance, who warned that the IMF and the EU would not unlock the necessary 8 billion euros loan without written guarantees from all parties that they would support the planned measures, Antonio Samaras replied that his word was enough and that he would not sign anything under external pressure.
Euthanasia and assisted suicide must be legalized, says expert committee
Canadians are denied death, says a report by the Royal Society of Canada
As for palliative care, the committee says that government, health institutions and doctors work together to provide the best palliative care, and that's not counting cancer cases.
Canadians are denied death.
Only 9% of Canadians would tell their doctor when they want to die and take steps to do so.
This is one of the conclusions of an impressive report by the Royal Society of Canada, which included six experts from a variety of fields, including ethics, law, and medicine.
The Committee proposes that the Government amend the Criminal Code to allow assisted suicide and euthanasia when the choice is imposed by circumstances and the patient can be considered competent to make such a decision.
To begin, the experts refer to a recent study by the Bureau of Economic Research that compared the quality of death in 40 countries.
Although Canada is ranked 10th, the study notes that "the medicalization of death in Canada has created a culture in which people are afraid to argue about death".
Medicated or not, 77% of Canadians lack access to palliative care, according to experts appointed by the Royal Society of Canada.
And 68.6% of them end up dying in the hospital.
The highest rate in the country is in Quebec, where 86% of deaths occur in hospitals.
On the sensitive issue of euthanasia and assisted suicide, the report's authors reach a conclusion that contradicts the position of the federal government, which has already stated that it does not want to change anything in the criminal code regarding euthanasia and assisted suicide.
Now, according to experts who have also studied the position of all countries where such practices have been legalized or decriminalized, there is no evidence that this decriminalization leads to abuse in practice, that is, to the practice of euthanasia or assisted suicide against people who cannot or do not want to make such a decision.
On the contrary, most of these cases were in countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide were not legalised, Joselyn Downey, who presented the report, confirmed during a teleconference.
Euthanasia is practiced in Canada, where it's obviously illegal.
Assisted suicide is practiced in Canada, where it is clearly illegal, explains Jocelyn Downey.
Canadians for euthanasia
It's important to remember that 85% of Canadians are in favor of euthanasia because, according to a 2010 Angus Reid poll, they believe it will allow people to ease their suffering at the end of their lives.
And 66% believe that legalizing euthanasia will not signal that the lives of the elderly or disabled are of less value.
When it comes to people who assisted in suicide, 41% of those surveyed believe they should not be prosecuted.
The situation is less clear-cut when it comes to extending or terminating medical care, the report's authors say.
They also suggest, among their other recommendations, that the criminal code should establish that legally lawful termination of medical care is not a crime.
The Committee of Experts also requires that health professionals be trained in a respectful way to refuse medical care at the end of life without fear of criminal prosecution.
As for palliative care, the Committee calls on the government, health care institutions and physicians to work together to develop the best possible palliative care, not just for cancer cases.
Finally, with regard to palliative or terminal sedation, which is already widely used in Canadian health care institutions, the Committee requires that it be used when it is not used for the purpose of numbing physical pain, as is euthanasia, and subject to the same restrictions.
Other experts ' remarks
Some experts in the field of health-related legislation have already expressed their concerns about the Royal Society of Canada's expert report.
The expert on health legislation, M. Pierre Deschans, described the position of the experts who signed the report as "extreme", because, among other things, it does not limit the use of euthanasia to deaths.
This opens the door to a situation where anyone who is tired of life and over 18 can ask for help committing suicide, says M. Deshan, who discussed the summary of the report yesterday.
Deschamps also stressed that the authors of the report seem to place the independence of the individual above all other values that make up the social fabric of society.
He said that "there are warning signs and prohibitions in society".
Health-care law expert Margaret Somerville also expresses "catastrophic disagreement with the findings of the report, which she calls a "manifesto for euthanasia".
Margaret Somerville, who is a fellow of the Royal Society of Canada, disputes the report's findings on abuse in countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide are legal, such as the Netherlands and Oregon.
Jordan's King calls on President Assad to cede power
Damascus condemns the "conspiracy"
Syria is increasingly isolated.
Bashar Assad's supporters held a demonstration yesterday in front of the Foreign Ministry building.
Yesterday, diplomatic pressure on Syria increased against Bashar al-Assad, who, with the support of Russia, is resisting him and condemning the "conspiracy" against his country.
Two days after Syria's membership in the Arab League was suspended, the European Union tightened sanctions against Damascus, and Syria's neighbors Turkey and Jordan called for President Assad's resignation.
Jordan's King Abdullah II yesterday became the first Arab leader to call for President Bashar al-Assad to abdicate in Syria, where some 40 more civilians and members of the regime's armed forces have been killed.
"If Bashar had the interests of his country at heart, he would have to resign, but he would also have to create the conditions for a new phase of political life", the king of Jordan, a country neighbouring Syria, told the BBC in an interview.
Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoğlu expressed regret that Turkey's mediation efforts, which began earlier this year, have not been successful.
Those in the Middle East who do not live in peace with their people and cannot satisfy their aspirations will lose power, he said, referring to Syria, a neighboring country against which Turkey is taking an increasingly tough course.
For its part, the United States welcomes the "expanding consensus against Assad and the actions of the Syrian regime" following the decisions of the Arab League and the European Union.
The international community, the United States, the European Union, the Arab League and countries like Turkey are taking an increasingly tough line on the repression in Syria, said Mark Toner, a spokesman for the State Department.
During this time, 16 civilians and at least 19 members of the regime's armed forces were killed in the Deraya area in southern Syria, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (OSDH) reported.
Two other residents were killed in a shootout and heavy machine gun fire in Jobar in the besieged city of Homs, according to the ONG.
During a press conference, Syrian Foreign Minister Walid Muallem said the country was nearing the end of the crisis".
He also reacted sharply to the Arab League's decision to exclude Damascus, which he said was a "dangerous step".
Syria will not be broken, he added, assuring that this plot against Syria will fail".
After its decision to exclude Syria, the Arab League is currently studying "the mechanism for the protection of civilians and demands the detention of 500 members of the Arab human rights organization, journalists and military observers.
French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe also spoke in favour of sending UN observers to help protect civilians from the repressions of a regime he said was "paranoid".
A new emergency meeting of the League is scheduled for tomorrow in Rabat to discuss the implementation of the crisis resolution plan adopted on November 2nd, which includes the withdrawal of armed forces from cities where fighting is taking place and the release of arrested protesters.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov yesterday called the Arab League's decision "incorrect", while China urged Syria to implement a plan to exit the crisis, but refrained from supporting possible sanctions against Damascus.
Italy and the United States
Monty demands time from the markets and sacrifices from the Italians.
The future head of the Italian government, Mario Monti, asked the markets for some time to form his team and execute a program that would require "sacrifices" to restore the creditworthiness lost in the last few months of Berlusconi's rule.
The former European Commissioner took part in a debate with political parties yesterday before today's meeting with trade unions and employers.
He'll have to form a relatively moderate cabinet, made up of technocrats outside parliament.
Monti spoke of the importance of a program that involves many sacrifices, said Francesco Nukara, a spokesman for one of the many small parliamentary groups taking part in the discussions after meeting the candidate for prime minister.
House Speaker Gianfranco Fini said he would wait to see if Mario Monti would ask parliament to vote on confidence before Friday to make sure the new government had enough support.
The meeting will end with Mr. Monte presenting a limited list of a dozen or so ministers to the head of state, Giorgio Napolitano.
Mr. Monti commented on yesterday's nervousness among stock exchanges and bondholders, asking for their time.
"Democracy requires time to prepare government and programs", he said, adding that he believes markets will be patient and understanding.
His appointment as president was initially approved by the markets, but anxiety reignited, particularly after the unexpected fall in industrial production in the Eurozone in September.
The newly appointed prime minister was to form a team that included, most importantly, technocrats, although he stressed that he would also like to include "politicians".
The new government should be in place by 2013, the date of the next election, he said.
According to the Speaker of the Chamber of Deputies Gianfranco Fini, the new government will receive a vote of confidence from the parliament on Friday.
Mr. Monti has guaranteed that, once in office, he will work hard to ensure that Italy becomes a major player in Europe again.
A spokesman for the European Commissioner, Olli Ren, stressed that "despite the new government, our assessment of the Italian economy has not changed".
The European Union, convinced that Rome will not meet its 2013 budget despite the austerity plan adopted in recent months, has demanded, in particular, new austerity measures.
Italian "boss of bosses" Emma Marchegallo, who will meet with him on Tuesday, also insisted on the need to restart the economy, "because a country that has no growth cannot meet the parameters of deficit".
Mr. Monti, known for his competence and independence as European Commissioner (1994-2004), represents a "change of era" for Italy after 17 years of "Berluscanism", a "professor" symbolizing "the challenge of seriousness" and "another Italy", according to the authors of the foreword.
The big unknown is the longevity of his team.
President Napolitano would be happy to avoid early elections, as Italy has to pay off its public debt of 200 billion euros by April 2012.
Russian scientist helped Iran 's nuclear program
Russian scientist Vyacheslav Danilenko helped Iran develop a detonator suitable for use in nuclear weapons, an American agency specializing in nuclear hazards confirmed Monday.
The Institute for Science and International Security (ISIS) relies on a recent report by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and other documents from the UN agency to establish the identity of the scientist.
Last week, the IAEA expressed concern about the "possible military aspect" of Iran's nuclear program.
According to ISIS, which relies heavily on IAEA documents, Mr. Danilenko was born in 1934, worked for 30 years, "starting in the sixties, at the Soviet military nuclear center in Chelyabinsk (Ural) and was involved in the production of synthetic diamonds by blasting methods".
In 1989 or 1991 he left the center to set up a company producing "nano-diamonds" in Kiev.
Financial difficulties of his company led him to contact the Iranian embassy in Ukraine in 1995.
He then worked with the Iranian program from 1996 to 2002, before returning to Russia.
The IAEA report mentions "clear indications that Iran's development of" nuclear detonators "was facilitated by the work of a foreign expert who not only knew the technology well but who also told the agency that he had worked on the technology for most of his career as part of his home country's military nuclear program".
Anti-Muslim crimes increased by 50%
According to the FBI's statistics released Monday, anti-Muslim crimes increased by nearly 50 percent between 2009 and 2010, while other forms of racial and religious violence have declined slightly or remained unchanged over the same period.
According to these figures, the total number of cases of violence against Muslims increased from 107 in 2009 to 160 in 2010, which is equivalent to a 49% increase, compared to a 13% increase in cases of violence against Catholics, a 4% reduction in attacks on Jews and a 14% increase in religious-based crimes.
The total number of hate crimes, according to the FBI, rose very slightly to 6,628, of which 47.3% were motivated by racial differences and 20% by religious differences.
After a decline in 2009, it is worrying that the number of such crimes is increasing again, Human Rights First stresses, "the increase in cases of violence against Muslims is particularly significant", the organization adds in an official statement.
"Human Rights First has long stressed that acts of violence against Muslims, like all forms of hate crimes, should be treated as serious human rights violations", added Paul Legendre, one of the organization's executives.
"The U.S. government can and should do more to address these crimes", he adds, believing that this can be done by improving police reporting on hate crimes".
"Hate crimes" in federal law are a legacy of the civil rights era.
This law was passed after the death of Martin Luther King to punish acts of violence based on race, color, religion, nationality, and, today, sexual orientation.
Twitter is changing its platform to look like Facebook
On Monday, the microblogging site Twitter made changes to its platform presentation that will allow its users, in particular, to see the activity of those they follow, making the service similar to Facebook.
The new activity tab and a different name make it easier and more direct to follow the activities of other Twitter users, those whose posts ("Tweets") you follow, and those who follow yours.
It allows you to know if they're posting, if they're signing up for new accounts, if they're getting selected messages, etc.
This new Twitter formula was tested "on a small percentage of users in August" before going into widespread use across the network on Monday, Twitter spokeswoman Caroline Penner told AFP.
Twitter, which has long been known to be intuitively rather vague and to use rather vague terms (RT for someone else's seductive retweet, #followfriday for recommendations to follow other users), is opening itself to a wider audience by presenting users with something closer to the popular social networks Facebook and Google+.
Users have been discussing the innovation via online tweets.
"It's useless, it's obsessional and it's too much like Facebook".
Functional activity will help me better track certain elements of my Twitter feed, @dannykronstrom wrote.
Austria
The introduction of the "golden rule" of the budget into the constitution
The leadership of Austria's ruling Social Democrats and Christian Democrats grand coalition decided on Tuesday to write a budgetary "golden rule" into the constitution to reduce the budget deficit and thus avoid a possible downgrade by rating agencies of Austria's state credit rating (triple A).
The Social Democratic Chancellor Werner Feymann personally announced this decision at the end of the Council of Ministers, despite the fact that Austria's public debt is 74.6%, which is significantly higher than the upper threshold of 60%, established by the Maastricht Treaty, but lower than the public debt of countries such as Italy, Greece or Spain.
If Austria's ability to pay had fallen by just one point, from AAA to AA+, we would have to pay interest by three thousand million euros more every year, argued Christian Democrat Vice Chancellor and Foreign Minister Michael Spindelleger.
Austria is thus fulfilling the demand of the summit of Eurozone member states on 26 October in Brussels; the heads of state and government demanded a reduction in budget deficits by the end of 2012 and a return to balanced public accounts through a constitution or equivalent law.
The Austrian government's decision is reminiscent of the "German model", since Germany was the first European country to adopt this "rule".
Until 2017, the structural deficit of the state budget should be reduced every year by 0.75% of the gross domestic product (GDP), and from 2017 the structural deficit of the state budget of the federal state in any year should not exceed 0.35% of the GDP, and lands, like communes, should represent balanced budgets.
The goal is to bring the public debt below the 60% mark, as enshrined in the Maastricht Treaty, by 2020/2021.
I 'm not sure .
threatens to create new intervention in the currency market
Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda warned Tuesday that Japanese authorities will make new interventions in the foreign exchange market if the yen continues to rise.
We will intervene, as we did last time, given the extreme volatility of the yen exchange rate, Mr. Noda explained to the Senate.
On Tuesday, the yen rose almost to a historic high, prompting the Japanese authorities to intervene on October 31.
On that day, Tokyo sold the yen for dollars on a large scale to lower the value of the Japanese currency, which had set a new record of strength since 1945.
But the yen has been rising steadily since then, driven by purchases by investors who see it as a "refuge" in these troubled times of global economic downturn and the debt crisis in Europe.
On Tuesday, the dollar fell below 77 yen, and the euro fell below the symbolic bar at 105 yen, close to the level that triggered the last intervention.
On the eve of the 2008-2009 financial crisis, the dollar was worth about 120 yen, and the euro was worth more than 160 yen.
The rise in the Japanese currency is hurting Japanese exports, as it makes Japanese products more expensive and reduces the amount of income Japanese firms earn from abroad when converting to the national currency.
"Japan is struggling to recover" after the March 11 earthquake and tsunami that devastated the Tohoku region, Node stressed, fearing that the rising yen will kill the fragile germ of recovery.
The world's third-largest economy resumed growth in the third quarter - 1.5% compared to the previous quarter - for the first time in a year, thanks to the growth in exports and consumption of households affected by the disaster.
But the prime minister feels that the high yen price does not reflect "Japan's fundamental economic indicators".
Finance Minister Jun Azumi urged the Bank of Japan (BoJ), which opened a two-day meeting of its monetary policy council on Tuesday, to take all necessary steps to weaken the yen.
But Deputy Governor Hirohide Yamaguchi warned that the Bank of Japan had already taken "appropriate steps", making it clear that no further easing was expected on Wednesday.
At its last meeting in late October, the issuer increased its purchases of treasury bonds by 5,000 million yen (47 thousand million euros), raising to 55,000 thousand million yen (519 thousand million euros) the ceiling on the amounts it is allocating to purchase various financial instruments to saturate the securities market.
The Eurozone
Rates are rising, stock markets are fluctuating.
The risk of debt crisis is undermining European indexes.
Despite the appointment of new heads of state in Greece and Italy and the improvement in growth rates in France and Germany, rates in unstable countries continue to rise.
Still concerned about the stability of the eurozone, European stock markets went a little further into the negative zone on Tuesday, November 15.
In Paris at 10am CAC 40 lost 1.4% and ended trading at 3.064 points.
The DAX in Frankfurt fell by 0.4%, and London by 0.1%.
With the new difficulties in paying back loans by the euro area countries in difficulty, stock markets around the world continue to lose some of their recent gains.
"Afflicted investors are just too worried about the risk of infection", explains Terry Pratt, an institutional broker at IG Markets, quoted by Reuters.
The Tokyo stock exchange closed down 0.7% amid renewed doubts among market participants about Europe's ability to contain the debt crisis.
"Japan, like the rest of the world, has turned its gaze to Europe, and the stock exchanges will follow one another in a narrow corridor of change until investors have proof that the situation has stabilized", says Mitsushige Akino, fund manager at Ichiyoshi Investment Management.
This return of anxiety about the future of the eurozone is hitting the single currency, which continued to fall on Tuesday.
The euro has reached its lowest level in a month and a half.
By 10 a.m., the European currency was worth $1,3570, down 0.4%.
According to brokers, it fell after Chancellor Angela Merkel's CDU party congress on Monday, where a resolution was passed, including the possibility for a country in difficulty to leave the eurozone without leaving the European Union.
Italian and Spanish rates are significantly higher than 6%
The credit rates in Italy and Spain remain at a very worrying level.
This Tuesday morning, the yield on Italian 10-year bonds reached 6.85%, and the yield on Spanish bonds with the same maturity reached 6.2%.
These interest rate difficulties in the southern countries, but also in France, continue to fuel the participants' fears.
The future head of the Italian government, Mario Monti, asked the time-sharing exchange to restore the situation in Italy, which was in danger of being paralyzed by the weight of its debt.
Greece's new prime minister, Lucas Papademos, confirmed that implementing the decisions taken at the eurozone summit on October 27 will be the "main task" of his government.
Spain was under fire before the parliamentary elections on Sunday.
The interest rate spread on 10-year German and Spanish debt obligations has reached a new historic high.
Growth figures in the Eurozone
France recorded economic growth of 0.4% in the third quarter, slightly better than the 0.3% expected, due to increased household consumption.
Insee, however, revised downward the second quarter, with GDP falling 0.1% instead of stagnating.
And the fourth quarter is what the economists are most concerned about.
Germany, in turn, recorded a growth of 0.5% over the same period.
The first assessment for the eurozone as a whole is expected at 11 a.m., with the European Commission warning of the danger of a new recession.
Energy policy:
Facts must prevail over dogmas
If there is one issue that cannot be decided after a brief discussion or under the influence of emotion, it is energy policy.
The availability and cost of electricity directly affect the purchasing power and competitiveness of companies.
It is a healthy trend that election meetings become a reason to think about the role and place of nuclear energy.
The debate will not bear fruit until all the economic, social and environmental implications of the proposed options are explored.
France must base its opinion on objective facts and rational data.
We're seven billion people on the planet right now, and demographic growth will double our electricity needs by 2050 unless a huge portion of the world's population is deprived of the elements that are vital to life.
During the same period, it will be necessary to fill the growing fossil resource gap to continue producing electricity on a continuous basis, while also keeping in mind the critical need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to combat climate imbalance, a topic that has disappeared from the environmental debate.
The Fukushima accident doesn't change any of those things.
That's why Germany is left alone in its decision to abandon nuclear energy.
This is not the case of Belgium, which has made its decision dependent on the need to find a source of energy that can replace nuclear energy, or Switzerland, which has decided to build only the most modern reactors.
On the other hand, the United Kingdom, Finland, Poland, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India, Brazil - these are just a few of the countries that are determined to continue their projects.
The United States decided to add one more unit to its fleet after Fukushima, resuming construction of the station that had been interrupted after the Three Mile Island accident.
Although the German renewable energy model is sometimes cited as an example, the reality contradicts this argument.
The choice of Berlin would result in increased electricity costs, increased energy dependence, exacerbated by the increased demand for imported gas, particularly from Russia, and a jump in carbon dioxide emissions due to the construction of gas and coal stations.
In a few months, all these unpleasant effects will be felt.
We should consider the example of Denmark.
Europe's champion in turbine construction, from which it gets 30% of its electricity, it is also the largest consumer of coal and gas due to intermittent wind; which causes carbon dioxide emissions and electricity prices to be 65% and 50% higher than the European average, respectively.
On the other hand, thanks to our consistent energy policy, our neighbors pay 40% more for electricity than French households.
As the price of energy is a key factor in competitiveness and the guarantee of maintenance of industrial equipment on the national territory in a globalized economy, French companies benefit from the cheapest electricity in Europe.
As a result, any significant reduction in nuclear power will lead to a large increase in the cost of electricity, which will make the beautiful claims of our country's new industrialization and the protection of purchasing power illusory.
A price that most French people refuse to pay, especially because they have no objection to this type of energy in principle.
It should be recalled that the country's energy policy has made it possible to create an industry with 125,000 direct jobs and 410,000 indirect jobs.
Strongly export-oriented, it attracts a whole slew of small and medium-sized enterprises specialising in international trade and creates many jobs that cannot be transferred to another industry.
If France were to decide to abandon nuclear energy, it would have to sacrifice a large number of these enterprises and lose 6 billion euros a year from French exports of nuclear equipment and services.
What electrical engineer would order an EPR designed to run for 60 years if the manufacturer was scheduled to shut down?
To solve the energy equation, we must recognize that there are no divine or diabolical sources of energy.
Areva's development of low-carbon, nuclear and renewable solutions is a testament to the complementarity of energy sources.
Maintaining the highest level of security is a vital issue for nuclear energy .
In France, we have a security authority that exercises uncompromising and transparent control over existing energy centres, such as Flamenville.
Our teams, whose professionalism is universally acknowledged, are filled with the same obsession with safety.
In 50 years, the nuclear industry has experienced three major accidents.
Only one, Three Mile Island, occurred under normal operating conditions, but without any human or environmental impact.
At Chernobyl, the reactor's design and an unforgivable human error led to tragedy.
In Fukushima, some people seem to forget that the accident was the result of two natural disasters of unprecedented strength that claimed tens of thousands of lives.
The nuclear industry will learn from this accident, as it did from the two before.
The result of this step and cooperation between security agencies, operators and French and German designers, EPR, is a project that allows us to confront such phenomena.
Since it is considered by all energy professionals who wish to build a reactor, the halt in its construction in Flamenville would be a great gift to Areva and EDF's competitors, paving the way for them to take the lead in the inevitable development of nuclear energy.
It is necessary and legitimate to seek the best combination of energy sources for our country, but it would be irresponsible to allow emotions, dogmas and biased maneuvers to prevail in a dispute that is so important to our country's economic, social and financial status.
Immigration - Burden or Benefit for the Economy?
The immigration policy of Nicolas Sarkozy has been criticized from various quarters - overloading the police, judicial and administrative services, subordinated to the politics of numbers and the compatibility of this policy with France's self-proclaimed status as a "human rights state".
Then there was the administrative harassment of foreign students, which made headlines when the Minister of the Interior (Liberation, May 23) declared that France "did not need foreign talents, stonemasons and waiters".
But it's rarely analyzed from an economic perspective.
Right and left are in agreement on a lot of things.
The right-wing was set by Jacques Chirac, who in 1976 declared that "900,000 unemployed people will not be a problem in a country with 2 million foreign workers", and the left-wing was set by Michel Rocard, who in 1990 explained that France "cannot accept poor people from all over the world".
The difference is in the level of generosity.
In 2005, both the left and the right felt the fear of invasion of the country by the hordes of Polish water pipelines.
Both sides see immigration as a burden on the French economy and on French society.
The only difference is the level of generosity they're willing to show to immigrants.
In his programme, François Hollande limited himself to the trivia, saying that "working together will solve our immigration problem".
This view of immigration as a burden and a problem can provide an electoral advantage, but it is very costly economically.
As economists Ian Goldin and Jeffrey Cameron remind us in their recent book summarizing recent immigration data (Special People: How Migration Shaped Our World and Will Determine Our Future, May 2011, Princeton University Press, 352 pages), there is broad consensus among experts on the positive impact of migration flows on economic growth, wages and employment in countries that receive immigrants.
Restricting immigration leads to weaker growth and lower employment.
Fears of the influence of immigrants are based on the notion that they can replace local workers, especially those with low skills, by provoking lower wages.
But experience shows that in reality, immigrants are far more complementary than replacement for the local workforce, doing jobs for which the local workforce is lacking.
The unskilled immigrants work in sectors that do not attract local labour, and the most skilled immigrants work in dynamic sectors where training is not linked to job offers.
Positive impact on salaries
Just as it would be difficult for a surgeon to work in a country where there is a shortage of anesthesiologists, the complementarity between locals and immigrants means that the influx of immigrants has a positive impact on the wages of local workers.
Giovanni Peri calculated that a 1% increase in the migration flow leads to a 0.6-0.9% increase in real long-term wages.
And that's without taking into account the fact that the diversity brought by immigrants creates new ideas and economic growth (there are a large proportion of naturalized immigrants among American Nobel Prize winners, and Google, Intel, Paypal and Yahoo were all founded by immigrants).
Migrants also contribute net income to the social security system, contributing on average 1% of the total budgets of European countries.
The World Labor Organization estimates that, for example, in Germany, an immigrant arriving at the age of 30 will bring an average of EUR 150 000 in net income (income minus expenses) to the state budget over his lifetime.
Nicolas Sarkozy, at the beginning of his term, was going to "tooth" the missing points of growth.
The teeth used to scare off immigrants had the exact opposite effect.
Europe has invented democracy, it remains to understand European democracy
Democracy is a valuable asset; but it is also fragile.
The European continent should remember that, having invented it in Athens more than two thousand years ago, in the 20th century it has survived the tragedies of World War I, totalitarian regimes, the Holocaust, the Gulag, as well as Franco in Spain, Salazar in Portugal and the colonels in Greece.
Some believed that for democracy to finally triumph over its enemies, it was enough to arrange the vote and make it as direct as possible.
We've known since Napoleon the Younger that it comes from the surface of thinking.
The universal vote, while a necessary condition of democracy, is not a sufficient condition and may even become "an instrument of repression", as the republican philosopher Etienne Vashko once said.
No, democracy requires much more: public space, public spirit, values, organization, division and control of power, education, education, economic and social solidarity, justice.
The European crisis we are experiencing is an economic crisis, but it is first and foremost a political crisis and a crisis of democracy.
In this respect, the palinody of the true-false Greek referendum will have a double exposing effect, demonstrating both the need for a serious policy change and the unpleasant feeling of its impossibility and inconsistency.
This duality needs to be understood to overcome it.
The truth is that the front line of the fight for democracy has shifted now, and many believe that the Republican soldiers are now aiming in the wrong direction.
We won't win anything by demanding a series of national referendums, organized as needed and in a chaotic order.
A carte blanche for an absolute European monarch or a bound leg jump into the abyss of nationalism - what a choice for a citizen!
No, we do not dream of a guillotine blade, but of the implementation - joint, clear and continuous - of choice and democracy, this time at the European level.
There are no crises in Greece, Italy, Spain, Portugal, and I don't know how many more I have to list, because there is only one crisis, the crisis of Europe.
The whole of Europe is subject to the dictates of markets and rating agencies, suffering from its own weakness and lack of solidarity.
The whole of Europe is humiliated on the international stage.
Many are concerned about the transfer of sovereignty to Europe, but Europe as a whole is gradually losing its sovereignty, and with it each of its nations.
It is urgent to return the management of the European project to the people's sovereignty.
Because only by working together can Europeans reduce the burden of each other's debts, free themselves from markets and prepare for the future by investing in it.
The way out of the crisis will require solutions at the European level, and they cannot be adopted without full democratic legitimacy, without leading us to disaster.
After a long discussion of this proposal, the socialists and Jacques Delors are now demanding a European economic government.
Let's have it.
But to imagine it without the stronger economic, political and democratic integration that has been achieved by citizens is another madness and a new deadlock.
We must start a new phase of European construction.
To establish a republic in France, it was necessary to "create" republicans.
A revolution of interest would not be enough.
That lesson is still valid.
We must build an economically united Europe.
This can only be done by creating a more democratic Europe at the political level, a real European people's sovereignty.
To create Europe, let's create the Europeans.
Contactless chips are becoming more and more popular.
The World Chip-Card Exhibition opens Tuesday in Villepinte, near Paris, in an atmosphere of optimism.
In fact, by the end of 2011, global sales of microprocessors (bank cards, SIM-card phones) will have grown by 11 percent, to exceed 6 billion units, according to Eurosmart.
The most important is the contactless technology sector, which allows you to pay for public transport or shopping by simply holding a card over a reader.
460 million contactless chipsets will be sold worldwide this year, compared to 320 million the year before!
Their share will increase in 2012 (expected at 580 million units) and will make up almost 10% of the global chip-card market (6,925 million cards).
Europe, long lagging behind the Asia-Pacific region, is now moving forward in contactless payments.
About 26 million Visa cards are already equipped with this feature, and 75,000 terminals accept them.
France starts from a more modest position: there are 400,000 Visa contactless cards in circulation.
But the big stores are picking up the pace.
Carrefour has released 2.5 million MasterCard contactless passes this year.
To move to higher speeds, banks need to equip their customers.
"Two large organizations in France have promised to systematically distribute contactless credit cards to their customers in the future", said Gérard Neboui, CEO of Visa Europe France.
Banks are testing mobile payments.
But this is only the first stage of the development of the future payment method, which is the mobile phone.
So far, few devices have the NFC technology needed to make such transactions.
"They were postponed.
"But they should really take off next year".
"We expect global sales of 80 to 120 million units in 2012", explains Mark Berten, head of Eurosmart.
But the banks are moving forward.
Yesterday, Crédit Agricole announced that they would be conducting an experiment from December to June next year in Cannes.
Approximately 200 customers and employees will have iPhones equipped with contactless payment cases.
BPCE has a similar project in Strasbourg and Marseille.
And Société Générale also announced yesterday that it is preparing to launch an offer on the market that will allow its customers to pay via mobile phones.
The terrorist front spreads from the Sahara to Nigeria
Paris is concerned about the Islamic Maghreb's ties to the Boko Haram sect.
Long-held links between the Al-Qaeda terrorist group in the Muslim Maghreb (Aqmi) and the Boko Haram sect in Nigeria have been confirmed.
On Sunday, the deputy foreign minister of Algeria, Abdelkader Messaghel, even stated that Algerians are now confident.
"The way these two organizations are doing it, and the intelligence reports, show that they are actively cooperating", he explained, without going into details.
Paris seems to have come to the same conclusion.
The investigation into the kidnapping of two Frenchmen in Niger in January has revealed two links.
Abducted from a restaurant in Niamey by people close to Aqmi, Antoine de Lecourt and Vincent Delory were apparently killed the next day along with several of the kidnappers during an operation conducted by French special forces.
Among the debris left over from the operation, French and Nigerian investigators found several phone SIM cards belonging to the terrorists.
The axis of terror
Analysis of the calls indicated several interlocutors in Mali, Niger and Nigeria.
According to Radio France Internationale (RFI), investigators are particularly interested in two numbers; one points to a Nigerian who has lived for a long time in Maiduguri, a city in northern Nigeria, the cradle of Boko Haram, and the other to a man allegedly close to Aqmi and the sect.
"This is a step forward, but we must certainly wait for more solid evidence before we talk about operational cooperation between Aqmi and Boko Haram".
"But it is possible".
"It has been known for years that the sect receives financial and ideological support from outside and that it is becoming more and more active", says Kunle Amuwo, a Nigerian researcher.
In recent months, this support has become increasingly apparent through the actions and statements of Boko Haram and its methods, which now include the use of suicide bombers and increasingly sophisticated explosive devices of the same type used by Aqmi.
The international community, led by Washington, is now pressuring Abuja to address the problems being created by Boko Haram.
The fact is, the Nigerian authorities have traditionally viewed this group as a community of educated people who are not interested.
Fast success
Founded in 2002 in Maiduguri by a mosque, a school and the fundamentalist imam Mohammed Youssef, Boko Haram - which in Hausa means "Western education is a sin" - preaches the establishment of an Islamic emirate in the Muslim north of Nigeria.
In this poor region, the organization has achieved rapid success.
It is politicised and demands strict Sharia law, and its activists have begun a struggle against the corrupt central government.
It's mostly targeting churches, bars and government agencies.
In 2009, Boko Haram activists were particularly active, carrying out numerous attacks on police stations.
Abuja's reaction, as usual, is uncompromising.
The army blockaded the city and left 800 dead.
Muhammad Yusuf, taken alive, was killed in prison.
Now the sect is radicalizing and will extend beyond its northern territories.
Last Christmas, she claimed responsibility for the attack that killed 80 people in Jose, and then another in Abuja.
In June, Boko Haram staged the first suicide attack on a fortified police headquarters in Abuja.
In August, the local United Nations office will be their first international target.
The creation of a terrorist axis in Africa, which runs from Mauritania through Nigeria to Somalia, is now a concern for all security experts.
Today, with Aqmi entrenched in Mali and Niger, and Somali al-Shabaab operational in Kenya, Boko Haram poses a new threat to the continent.
Last week, during a conversation with President Goodluck Jonathan, Alain Juppe warned of the dangers of Boko Haram and expressed his willingness to share all available information.
The world as seen by Republican presidential candidates
With respect to China, Iran and aid to Israel, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain and Rick Perry compete in simplification and incompetence.
Can a crisis-weakened America lead a complex world with simple, or rather simplistic, ideas?
If you listened to the Republican presidential candidates, the voters might believe that.
For days now, Mitt Romney, Herman Kane, Rick Perry and others have been making loud but inadequate foreign policy statements that have traditionally been a Republican stronghold.
Slogans about China, Iran and aid to Israel are often confused.
Mitt Romney, who has the best chance of being nominated by the "Old Good Party", threatened to file a complaint against the Chinese at the WTO and accuse them of "manipulating their currency - a sensitive topic for America, angered by the migration of entire industries to Asia.
The worse it is if it leads to a trade war, he said.
John Huntsman, Obama's former ambassador to China and the only candidate who understands the complexities of foreign policy, has failed to overcome a position that is emotionally driven.
He called for a firm but constructive dialogue with Beijing (Obama's current position).
But Huntsman, who's at the bottom of the ratings, has gone unheard.
It 's Reagan style .
Romney also promised military strikes on Iran if sanctions fail to stop its nuclear program.
"If I'm elected, I'll stop Iran", he proclaimed.
"If Obama is re-elected, they'll have a bomb".
He also promised to increase military aid to Israel, accusing Obama of failing to deliver on his promises to the partner.
Entrepreneur Herman Kane, second in the list of candidates, has demonstrated a discouraging ignorance.
He recently called for a counter-terrorism campaign against the Chinese military threat because Beijing is trying to achieve nuclear power, apparently without knowing that China has had it since 1964!
Texas Governor Rick Perry, who supports Israel and wants to strike Iran, says he's ready to use the U.S. military in Mexico against drug cartels.
The use of torture for terrorism suspects, which was outlawed by Obama in 2009, is also recommended by Kane, Perry and candidate Michelle Bachman.
This is a far cry from the 2008 Republican candidate John McCain, the foreign policy heavyweight.
The current president's opponents say that Reagan had simple ideas and won the Cold War.
They remind us that Obama was an amateur himself and that he had to tone down his fight against terror.
They rightly insist on his failure in his naive dialogue with Iran, his premature withdrawal of the "boys" from Iraq, his tricks in Libya that earned him a reputation as a weak politician.
But the offensive isn't that simple.
The public sees the national security balance as positive under Obama, who eliminated bin Laden.
After Iraq, it doesn't believe in military intervention that gets buried in the sand.
And when he says America needs to be rebuilt economically to restore its leadership, Obama is right.
Nord Stream, the new gateway for Russian gas to Europe.
The Nord Stream gas pipeline, connecting Western Europe and Russia directly under the Baltic Sea, has been launched.
It's designed to supply the equivalent of 30 million households.
Gazprom, Russia's giant gas producer, wanted to celebrate with a pump.
More than 500 guests, including four heads of state and government, attended last Tuesday on the shores of the Baltic Sea, between a performance by the orchestra and a fine snack, the opening of the Nord Stream, the new gas pipeline that directly connects Russia and Germany underwater.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, French Prime Minister François Fillon and his Dutch counterpart Mart Rütte have together turned the symbolic valve that controls the flow of Russian gas into the Western European network.
The new pipeline will provide 27,5 million cubic meters of gas to Western Europe each year through the first pipeline, which will connect the Leningrad region with the Meklenburg-Pomeranian region.
The second pipeline is due to be completed by the end of 2012, providing a total of 55 billion cubic meters of gas, equivalent to the entire consumption of France.
And the possibility of building a third pipeline in the same direction is already being discussed.
For Gazprom, the timely completion of this huge project is a victory.
The project met with fierce resistance from Poland and the Baltic states.
Nord Stream will actually allow gas to be delivered directly to Germany, avoiding a third country (Poland or Ukraine).
These two countries will lose some of their power: they will find it harder to influence Russia, threatening to shut down access to Western European markets.
At the height of the debate, Warsaw did not stop at comparing the North Stream with the new "German-Soviet Pact", hinting at an alliance between Hitler and Stalin to occupy Poland in 1939.
That means it's politically sensitive.
By supporting this Russian project, Western Europe is seeking greater security of its supplies.
But at the cost of Europe's energy deficit, because the project created a gap between Eastern and Western Europe.
Russia has managed in less than five years to achieve its understanding of a direct alliance between Russia and the rich Western countries, which consume large volumes of gas and whose own reserves are already running out.
"This gas pipeline is part of the cooperation with Russia, it is a new artery that organically connects us", argued François Fillon, opening the pipeline, demonstrating the extent to which large gas contracts are important both politically and economically.
All this explains the broad smiles on the faces of the heads of Gazprom, who were present in large numbers in Lubmin, the point of arrival of the gas.
The construction of this pipeline is a technical feat.
The underwater pipeline is made of steel, encased in concrete to protect it from ship anchors.
It lies on the bottom of the sea, at an average depth of 200 meters.
To build it, we had to bypass the minefields left over from World War II.
"The stink had to be removed or destroyed as a precaution", said Jens Müller, a spokesman for Nord Stream.
Many steps were also needed to protect the fauna and flora.
The pipeline is a long metal snake weighing as much as 242 Eiffel Towers, with no gaps along its length, no valves, and no service stations.
The control platform was planned in the area of Sweden, but the project managers rejected it because Sweden was not thrilled that the Russian state-owned company would permanently settle on its shores.
"In the event of an accident, we can shut down the gas flow in less than a minute", says Jens Müller.
So if there's a leak, the gas in the pipeline will be released into the air.
But that seems unlikely to designers who have designed seams designed to only leak once every 100,000 years.
The gas pipeline will be monitored by an underwater robot that pulls the ship for external observation, as well as by a device that circulates inside the pipeline.
The cigar-shaped apparatus is inserted into a 1 meter diameter pipe and pushed forward by a gas stream.
Upon arrival after 3 full days of travel at 3 meters per second, it gives accurate information on any deformation of the metal.
The pipeline was designed to run for 50 years without the slightest repair.
Gas circulation is only done by its pressure.
It's 200 bars on the way out and 100 bars on the way in.
Five companies have joined forces to implement this project.
The leader remains Gazprom, which owns 51% of the capital.
The rest are German companies E.ON and BASF (15.5% each), Dutch Gasunie and French Group GDF Suez (9% each).
These five companies formed a joint venture called North Stream, which was charged with building and operating the pipeline.
Its headquarters are in Zug, Switzerland, where taxation is particularly favourable.
Then Gazprom leased it to this company for 20 years with the option of extending the entire volume of gas transportation.
"Gazprom will pay for the full volume, regardless of how much gas is actually transported", says Jens Müller.
The gas pipeline was financed by 30% shareholders and 70% bank loans.
The total cost of the works will be 7.4 thousand million euros for two pipelines.
The investment of GDF Suez will be about 240 million.
But the minority shareholders are confident they'll recoup their costs because Gazprom takes all the risks.
The gas pipeline runs from the Baltic Sea in Lubmin to a sandy shore, planted with conifers.
The 4.5 meter high valves form the gas outlet.
The sensors measure the pressure, temperature and specific characteristics of the gas before it is pumped into German pipelines.
Since last Tuesday, the terminal has been receiving one million cubic meters of gas every hour.
At full capacity, it's going to be 3 million per hour, and in 2012, 6 million.
The Moleskine brand notebook
Moleskine, created by an Italian company 15 years ago, will bring back the taste for writing.
It has the smell of adventure, hours spent writing by candlelight.
The Moleskine notebook is easily recognizable by its rectangular black cover, by the rubber, by the yellowish-white pages that appear to have turned yellow over time.
However, the Moleskine notebook as we know it today was born in 1997.
Modo Modo, an Italian company based in Milan, decided to launch a designer notebook.
Maria Sebregondi, then a consultant for the company, took responsibility for launching the new product.
The note is inspired by the old production technique, moleskin - a lacquered cotton fabric used, for example, to cover benches.
It is said that this type of notebook is highly prized by writers and travelers.
"Moleskine brought to life an old and forgotten thing that was a cult for avant-garde artists until the 20th century", said Maria Sebregondi, who has since become the brand manager at Modo Modo.
Success has come.
From 2006 to 2010, sales increased by 25% and reached 12.7 million units.
We've come a long way from the early years, when only 3,000 notebooks were produced.
Moleskine has crossed the borders of Italy and is exported to 70 countries, from France to the United States.
It's hard to profile a typical buyer because the notebook attracts businessmen, students, and freelancers alike.
Moleskine's customers are cosmopolitan, broad-minded, and educated.
A small Italian company that started with only 12 employees now has 100 and two offices, one in Milan and the other in New York.
She distributes her notebooks in Fnac bookstores, small shops in the centers of small towns and has been able to gain wide recognition.
"We followed the spirit of the times and this new need for correspondence, despite the advent of e-mail", explains Maria Sebregondi.
This distinctive cultural trait has accompanied the development of Moleskine; the brand recently organized the "Round the Way" exhibition, where architects and artists showcased their own notebooks.
In August, he also launched a leopard cover for the Locarno Film Festival.
Using its success and cultural aura, Moleskine has diversified its products, which now include bags, pens, computer bags, and all kinds of support.
A success that aroused envy: in the fall of 2006, Modo Modo was bought by the investment fund SG Capital Europe, now Syntegra Capital, which wrote a new page in the history of Moleskine.
Why is the unemployment rate among disabled workers so high?
Approximately 19% of disabled people are looking for work.
The 15th week of employment for the disabled begins today.
Despite a public charity policy launched in 2005, the unemployment rate among the disabled is still twice the average, at 19%, compared to 9% for the general population.
Discouraging you?
"No", says Eric Blanche, CEO of Adapt, an organization that organizes Disability Employment Week.
"In 15 years, significant progress has been made".
"At that time, the unemployment rate was not two times higher, but three times higher".
"But there is still much work to be done".
I must say that there are still many obstacles to employment for the disabled.
Among them , there are more elderly: 37% over 50 years old (average 17%).
They are more of a low-skilled population: 80% do not have a bachelor's degree, and of the 2.3 million students in higher education, only 10,000 are disabled.
Finally, there is a very high prevalence of long-term unemployment, which is 85% for people with disabilities versus 38% on average.
In short, these are criteria that make it very difficult to return to work and that are the heart of the problem", says Christian Grapen, CEO of Tremplin, an association set up in 1992 to help companies hire disabled workers.
Here are some of the obstacles.
There's no need to talk about a mentality that's changing, but it's changing too slowly.
A study commissioned by Cité and conducted in April by IMS-Entreprendre found that managers had low levels of disability knowledge and "imagined themselves as solid people in wheelchairs or mentally or mentally handicapped".
The result is that private companies with more than 20 employees are still far from the target of having 6% disabled employees set out in the 1987 law.
The latest known figures for 2008 are 2.6%.
"Today we are at about 3 percent", says Pierre Blanc, CEO of Agefiph, an organization responsible for collecting taxes from companies that do not comply with the law.
Evidence: the number of 'taxable' organisations, as well as the amounts paid, decreased in 2007-2011 from 59 000 to 46 000 organisations (and from 606 to 480 million euros).
"The 2005 tax law put a lot of pressure on the companies", explains Pierre Blanc.
"But this improvement also reflects the growing awareness, particularly in large enterprises".
According to the Ministry of Employment, only 59% of organizations with 20 to 49 employees have disabled employees, compared to 82% of organizations with 100 to 199 employees.
"What a happiness"
Before facing the Blues on Tuesday night at 20:45 EDT, Eden Azar and Georges Leekens shared the pleasure they had from this friendly match.
We won't go so far as to say that there was a collusion, but the painting is symbolic.
Sitting next to each other on the Stade de France stage, Georges Leekens and Eden Azar made up.
Five months after his striker's comeback in the match against Turkey, the Belgian coach can only praise him.
"I'm very happy with Eden, his promotion and the fact that he's Belgian".
"I want to go further", assures Lilla's player.
As for the contrast between his achievements at the club and in the national team, it's one thing, he justifies.
"I'm in Lille all year round, but I'm not in Belgium".
"I have to earn points".
Left in reserve ahead of this France game against Romania on Friday night, Azar arrived in Saint-Denis to finally shine.
But not forgetting the concept of pleasure.
He has been with the Blues since the age of 7 and the winning campaigns of 1998 and 2000.
"I've always supported them", he says.
That, of course, adds to the special character of this match.
Especially the fact that on the other side are Matthew (Debushi), Johan (Kabe) and Adil (Rami)", he recalls.
"It's just that our paths crossed".
"To be able to play against them is pure happiness!"
Leekens kindly recalled the "pride".
"Pride" to play in the "holiday match".
"Pride" also claimed as a "neighbour" that France "has become a very high-level team again" just a year after the injury in Nice.
"Laurent Blanc was like a thunderstorm, he admired.
Now that Belgium will miss the next Euro, the technical athlete will fly in the same plane as the blue team... to Brazil in 2014.
"Our little Belgians are growing", he stressed.
"We're building something, the players are ambitious, they're hungry".
"You'll see that in future matches, including this one against France".
Portugal is very confident
Portugal's Paulo Bento starts his return match against Bosnia (22:00 p.m.) this Tuesday in Lisbon with great optimism.
On the way to the game, both teams seemed to lose their sense of reality.
"By the end of these 90 minutes, we'll be a happy team and, most importantly, a happy country".
Paulo Bento already sees himself in Poland and Ukraine.
He has no doubt that the national team, which he has been in charge of since September 2010, will qualify for Euro 2012.
Portugal is only 90 minutes from happiness.
But there's a game to be played, and Bosnia to be won.
With Friday's 0-0 in Zenit Hell, it's clear the game isn't over.
Although Portugal dominated the match for over an hour, they failed to reach the coveted goal that would have calmed them down.
"It's a good result, but it does involve some risk".
But at home, in their brightly lit stadium de la Luz in Lisbon, the Portuguese are confident they will pass, in front of an audience that should be thrilled, although the match will be very tense", said the optimistic but reasonable Bentu.
"We expect a very tense match, but we are convinced that we can win", the 42-year-old Portuguese coach said.
"We still have a 50% chance of being in Euro 2012", said the successor of Karlus Kairos.
Friday's draw against Bosnia demands victory from the Portuguese.
A draw could have settled the Bosniaks.
"It's a good result, but there is some risk involved", Bentu laments.
"We will be playing against a team that has a lot of technical strengths and players with a lot of individual strengths", he added.
As was the case in Zenica, the Portuguese are going to put maximum pressure on the Bosniaks from the beginning, "not giving them time to think".
Good idea, just to make it real this time.
