This not only confirms that at least some of the dinosaurs had feathers, an already widespread theory, but also provides details that fossils generally cannot provide, such as their color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Researchers say that the wings of this animal were brown above with a light or carrot color underneath.
The finding also provides information on the evolution of the wing in birds.
Because dinosaur wings do not have a fully developed axis, called a spine, but have other features of the winged "mustangs and whiskers", the researchers concluded that the spine was likely a later evolutionary development than the other features.
The structure of the wings suggests that they were used not for flight but for temperature control or demonstration. Scientists contend that although this is a tail from a young dinosaur, the sample reveals adult feathers rather than pupal feathers.
The researchers claim that although it is the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample suggests adult feathers, not a young one.
A car bomb exploded at police headquarters in Gaziantep, Turkey yesterday morning, killing two police officers and injuring more than 20 people.

They discovered that the sun operated on the same basic principles as the other stars: it was found that the activity of all the stars in the system was guided by their brightness, their rotation and nothing else.
The brightness and rotation are calculated together to determine the Rosby number of a star, which is related to the plasma flow.
The star is so inactive in terms of magnetic reversals, the smaller the Rossby number.

The part of the work that was completed was largely theoretical, however the program was designed to replicate the observations of the Archer galaxy.
What the team expected would be caused by tidal forces between the galaxy's dark matter and the Milky Way's equivalent.
Similar to the moon's pull on the earth, creating tides, the Milky Way's pull on the Milky Way galaxy.
Scientists have been able to conclude that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way as normal matter.
This theory holds that most of the dark matter in a galaxy is located around the galaxy, forming a kind of corona, and is made up of many small particles.

The police in Madeira Pradesh have recovered the stolen laptop and mobile phone.
Deputy Inspector General D. K. Aria said: "We have arrested five people who raped the Swiss and have recovered her mobile phone and laptop.
The accused are Baba Kanjar, Botha Kanjar, Rambro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar and Vishnu Kanjar.
Police chief Chandra Sekhar Solanki said the accused appeared in court with their faces covered.
Although three people were inside the house when the car crashed, no one was injured.
However, the driver suffered a serious head injury.
The road to the accident was temporarily closed as emergency services were pulling the driver out of the red Audi TT.
He was initially treated at James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He then went to Edinburgh Hospital in Cambridge.
Antheoia has since been indicted by the High Court of Edinburgh for the murder of her son.
She is in custody with charges and trial pending, but any eyewitness evidence may have been affected as her image has been widely publicized.
This is common practice in other parts of the UK, but the justice system in Scotland works differently and the courts have ruled that publishing photographs is potentially harmful.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee reports that "journalists seem to be on a tight leash if they publish photos etc. of suspects".
The Prosecutor's Office, which is generally responsible for prosecutions, has informed reporters that there will be no further comment until at least the indictment.
According to the leaked information, the document will refer to the border dispute that Palestine wants based on the borders before the Middle East war that was fought in 1967.
According to reports, other issues covered included the future status of Jerusalem, which is a holy site for both states, and the issue of the Jordan Valley.
Israel demands a continuous military presence in the valley for ten years once an agreement is signed, while the Palestinian Authority agrees to allow such a presence only for five years.
The snipers in the additional pest control test would be under close supervision by the rangers as the test was checked and its effectiveness assessed.
In collaboration with the National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS) and the National Wildlife Federation of Australia (NSW), expert volunteers were recruited as part of the National Wildlife Federation's hunting programme.
According to Mick O'Flynn, Director General for Parks Conservation and Heritage of the National Park Service, the four snipers selected for the first hunt were given detailed safety instructions and training.
Yesterday Martelli was sworn in to a new Provisional Electoral Council (PEC) consisting of nine members.
This is the fifth interim election in four years for Martelli.
Last month a presidential committee proposed the previous resignation of the Provisional Electoral Council as part of a package of measures to lead the country to new elections.
The committee was Martelli's response to the widespread protest protests that began in October.
Some violent protests have taken place because of the non-election, some of which have been pending since 2011.
According to official reports, there were about 60 instances of iPod malfunction resulting in high temperatures, starting six fires and leaving four people with minor injuries from the fire.
The Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry of Japan (METI) said it was aware of 27 accidents involving the devices.
Last week, the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) announced that Apple had notified it of 34 additional incidents of overheating, which the company called "not serious".
The ministry responded by calling it "really sad" that Apple's report was postponed.
The earthquake struck the Mariana Islands at 7:19 a.m. local time (09:19 p.m.
The Mariana Islands Emergency Management Bureau said there were no reports of damage in their territory.
Also, the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center (PTWC) said there was no indication of a tsunami.
A Filipino ex-police officer took Hong Kong visitors hostage while boarding their bus in his country's capital, Manila.
Rolando Mendoza fired at the tourists with his M16 rifle.
Several hostages have been rescued and at least six confirmed dead so far.
Six of the hostages, along with children and the elderly, were released early; so were the photographers from the Philippines.
The photographers later replaced an elderly lady who needed to use the toilet.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and chose a career in medicine.
She trained and became a gynaecologist, starting work in 1959 at the state women's clinic, Auckland.
While working at the hospital, Liggins, in his spare time, began researching premature labor.
His research suggested that if given a hormone, the embryonic lung would mature.
Xinhua said government investigators on Wednesday spotted two black box flight data recorders.
The fellow wrestlers paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said, "Luna was the first winner of the Queen of Extreme contest, my first manager, Luna died on the night of the two moons, as unique as she was, a strong woman, a strong woman, a strong woman, a strong woman, a strong woman, a strong woman, a strong woman, a strong woman, a strong woman, a strong woman, a strong woman, a strong woman, a strong woman, a strong woman, a strong woman, a strong woman, a strong woman, a strong woman, a strong woman, a strong woman, a strong woman, a strong woman, a strong woman, a strong woman, a strong woman, a strong woman, a strong woman, a strong woman, a strong woman, a strong woman, a strong woman, a strong woman, a strong woman, a strong woman, a strong woman, a strong woman, a strong woman, a strong woman, a strong woman, a strong woman, a strong woman, a strong woman, a strong woman, a strong woman, a strong woman, a strong woman, a strong woman, a strong woman, a strong woman, a strong woman, a woman, a woman, a woman, a woman, a woman, a woman, a woman, a woman, a woman, a woman, a woman, a woman, a woman, a woman, a woman, a woman, a woman, a woman, a woman, a woman, a woman, a woman, a woman, a woman, a woman, a woman, a woman, a woman, a woman, a woman, a woman, a woman, a woman, a woman, a woman, a woman, a woman, a woman, a woman, a woman, a woman, a woman, a woman, a woman, a woman, a woman, a woman, a woman, a woman, a woman, a woman, a woman, a woman, a woman, a woman, a woman, a woman, a woman, a woman, a woman, a woman, a woman, a woman, a woman, a woman, a woman, a woman, a woman, a woman, a woman, a woman, a woman, a man, a man, a man, a man, a man, a man, a man, a man, a man, a man, a man, a man, a man,
Dustin Goldstunnels commented that Luna was as weird as I was... maybe even more... I love her and I'll miss her... I hope she's in a better place.
Of the 1,400 people who took part in the poll before the 2010 federal election, those opposed to Australia becoming a republic have increased by 8 percent since 2008.
Acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard argued during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed Australia should become a monarchless republic when Queen Elizabeth II's reign ended.
34% of those who took part in the poll agreed with this idea, because they want Queen Elizabeth II to be the last monarch of Australia.
As for the two extremes of the poll, 29% of all respondents think that Australia should become a democracy without a monarch as soon as possible, while 31% think that Australia should never become a democracy without a monarch.
The Olympic gold medallist was expected to compete in the 100m and 200m freestyle and three freestyle events at the Commonwealth Games, but due to his injuries his physical condition is in question.
He couldn't get the pain medication he needed because it's banned by the Olympics.
Curtis Cooper, professor of mathematics and computer science at the University of Central Missouri, on January 25 discovered the largest prime ever found.
Several people verified the discovery using different hardware and software in early February and it was announced on Tuesday.
Comets may have been a source of water transportation to the earth as well as organic matter that can form proteins and support life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form, especially how the Earth formed, as comets collided with the Earth long ago.
Cuomo, 53, became governor earlier this year and last month signed a bill legalizing same-sex marriage.
He referred to the rumors as "political gossip and nonsense".
He is expected to run for president in 2016.
The Federal Civil Aviation Administration claims that the new generation air transport system would allow aircraft to operate shorter routes, save gallons of fuel each year and reduce carbon emissions.
The technology it uses is satellite-based as opposed to older radar-based ground-based technology to allow air traffic controllers to more accurately locate an aircraft and give more accurate information to pilots.
No further transportation is being made and the underground railways will not stop at Wembley.
Fears about the lack of transportation raise the possibility that the match will be forced to be held behind closed doors, without the team's fans.
A study reported Thursday in Science spoke of the existence of a new type of bird in the Galapagos Islands.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that the new species evolved in just two generations, although the process is believed to have lasted much longer, due to breeding between the endemic Darwin spider Geospiza fortes and the migratory spider Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be cut into all shapes, and it can be shaped into very small shapes.
It can be forged into a thin wire, and then bent and woven. It can be forged or wrapped in sheets.
It can become very thin and stick to other metals, and it can become so thin that it was sometimes used as a decoration in hand-drawn book illustrations called "illustrated manuscripts".
This is called the pH of a chemical, and you can make a marker using red cabbage juice.
Cabbage juice changes color depending on how acidic or basic (alkaline) the chemical is.
The pH level is determined by the amount of hydrogen ions (the H at pH) of the test chemical.
Hydrogen ions are protons that no longer have their electrons (as a hydrogen atom is made up of a proton and an electron).
Twist the two dry powders together and then, with clean, wet hands, press them together into a ball.
The moisture in your palms will react with the outer envelopes, which will create a strange sensation and create something like a peel.
The towns of Charapa and Mohenjo-daro had a toilet with a pot in each house, connected to a sophisticated sewer system.
Also in Greece, in the homes of the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini, ruins of sewer systems have been found.
Toilets also appeared in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. Toilets in Rome were often part of public baths, where everyone of any gender constituted a mixed crowd.
When you call someone who's very far away, you use a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the call and then sends it back to earth almost instantaneously.
The satellite was launched by rocket, and the experts have space telescopes because the atmosphere of our planet is causing distortions in our light and visibility.
It takes a giant rocket over 100 feet high to send a satellite or a telescope into space.
The contribution of the wheel to the world is amazing. The most important of all is the simplest and fastest way to move.
Thanks to him we have trains, cars and many other means of transportation.
Below them are more medium-sized cats that feed on medium-sized prey ranging from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
Finally, there are many predatory kittens (including the domestic cats that are left free) that hunt the myriad of insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret to their success is the idea of position, of a special role each cat has, that prevents competition between them.
Lions are the most social of cats, living in large groups called herds.
Herds consist of one to three adult males that mate with each other along with up to thirty females and their young.
Females are usually closely related to each other, forming a large family of sisters and daughters.
Lion herds act much like wolf or dog herds, animals that are strikingly similar to lions (but not to other big cats) in behavior, and are also extremely deadly to their prey.
The tiger, as an accomplished athlete, can climb (at not a very good level), swim, make huge jumps, and use five times the strength of a strong man to lift something.
The tiger is in the same genus as the lion, leopard, and jaguar, and these four cats are the only ones that can roar.
The tiger's roar is not like the loud roar of a lion, but it is more like a phrase than angry, loud words.
The oselots prefer small animals, they will hunt monkeys, snakes, rodents, even birds, and almost all the animals the oselots hunt are smaller than themselves.
Scientists believe that oselots follow and find animals to feed (hunt) through smell, sniffing the ground to see where they are.
They see very well in the dark through night vision and move silently. Oselots hunt their prey through adaptation to their environment and then by attacking their prey suddenly.
When a small group of living organisms (a small population) is separated from the main population from which it came (for example if they move to a mountain range or a river, or if they move to a new island so that they cannot easily return) they will often encounter a different environment than in the past.
This new environment has new sources and different competitors, so the new population will need different characteristics or adaptations to be a strong competitor than what was required in the past.
The indigenous people have not changed at all, the same adjustments as in the past need to be made.
As time goes by, as the new population begins to adapt to the new environment, the similarity to the rest of the population gets smaller and smaller.
At some point, after thousands or maybe millions of years, the two populations will look so different that they can't be considered the same species.
This process is called indogenesis, which means the formation of new species. Indogenesis is an inevitable outcome and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce the oxygen that humans breathe and absorb carbon dioxide that humans exhale (i.e., exhale).
Plants make their food from the sun by photosynthesis.
Our homes and our clothes are made of plants. Most of the food we eat is plants. Without plants, animal survival would be impossible.
The Mosasaurus was the leading predator of his time, so he was not afraid of anything except the other Mosasaurs.
Its long jaws had over 70 razor-sharp teeth combined with an extra set of teeth at the top of its mouth, indicating that there was no exit for anything that came in its way.
We don't know for sure, but he may have had a cleft tongue, fed on turtles, big fish, other mosasaurs, and he may have been a cannibal.
He would attack anything that entered the water, and even the giant dinosaur, Tyrannosaurus, would not be a rival to him.
Although most of their food would be familiar to us, the Romans also had various strange or unusual festive dishes, including wild boar, bananas, snails, and a rodent called gilliads.
Another difference is that the poor and women ate their food sitting in chairs, while the rich men preferred to eat at banquets where they could relax on their side while eating.
Meals in ancient Rome could not have contained foods that arrived in Europe from America or Asia centuries later.
For example, there was no corn, tomatoes, potatoes, or cocoa, and no ancient Roman had eaten turkey.
The Babylonians built for each of their gods a primary temple that was considered the house of the god.
People would sacrifice to the gods and the clergy would try to meet the desires of the gods by organizing rituals and celebrations.
In each temple there is an open courtyard and then an inner sanctuary that is only accessible to priests.
Sometimes they built specific towers in pyramidal shapes called ziggurats, and they were part of the temples.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary for the god.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, roofing was not that important.
The Jewish family spent most of their lives in the countryside.
Women cooked in the courtyard while shops were open counters facing the street.
The land of Canaan lacked large areas of forest, so timber was very expensive.
Greenland was sparsely populated. In the Norse saga it is said that Eric the Red was banished from Iceland for murder and, as he traveled west, he found Greenland and gave it that name.
However, despite its discovery, the Eskimos were already living there at this time.
Although each country was Scandinavian, the people, kings, customs, and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland differed greatly.
If you've seen the movie In the Footsteps of the Lost Treasure, you might believe that on the back of the Declaration of Independence is written a treasure map.
Although there is something written on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
On the back of the Declaration of Independence was written the following: "Original Declaration of Independence issued on July 4, 1776". This is written below, in reverse.
Although no one knows for sure who wrote it, it is known that from the start the large parchment document (29 3‚ÅÑ4 by 24 1‚ÅÑ2-inches) was wrapped for storage.
Therefore, the note may have been added simply as a label.
The Normandy landings and the ensuing battles liberated the French North, but the South was still not free.
It was run by the Vichy Government, which was made up of Frenchmen who had made peace with the Germans in 1940 and were working with the invaders rather than fighting them.
On 15 August 1940, the Allies invaded southern France; this raid was called Operation Dragon.
Within two weeks, the Americans and the Free French forces had liberated southern France and Germany was on the line.
Culture is a unique tradition shared by a large group of people who live and work together, a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin civilis, which means civil, which is related to the Latin civis, which means citizen, and civitas, which means city or city-state, and that actually describes in some way the size of society.
Cities-states are the ancestors of states. A cultural culture involves the transmission of knowledge from generation to generation, in a continuous cultural footprint and a superb dissemination.
Often, smaller civilizations disappear without leaving behind any relevant historical evidence and fail to be recognized as normal civilizations.
During the War of Independence, the thirteen states initially created a powerless central government - with Congress as the sole component - based on the Articles of Confederation.
Congress had no taxing power, and because there was no executive or judicial power, it relied on non-cooperative state authorities to enforce all laws.
Moreover, he had no jurisdiction to override interstate tax and customs laws.
The Articles required the unanimous consent of all the states before they could be amended, but the states took over the government so unopposedly that their representatives were often absent.
The national football teams of Italy and Germany are the second most successful teams in the world and were the champions of the 2006 FIFA World Cup.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, ice skating and Formula 1 racing.
Winter sports are more popular in the Nordic countries, with Italians participating in international competitions and Olympic Games events.
Japan is home to nearly 7,000 islands (Honshu is the largest), making it the 7th largest island on the planet!
Because of the island group that Japan has, the latter is often referred to as the  Archipelago, geographically speaking.
The origin of Taiwan goes back to the 15th century, when passing European sailors named the island Ilha Formosa, meaning beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in the southwestern part of Taiwan and began a transformation in the practices by which native grain was produced, employing Chinese workers on rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) dominated western and northern Taiwan, which they made an administrative province of their empire in 1885.
After losing the First Sino-Japanese War (1984-1985), the Qing Dynasty then concluded the Treaty of Shimonoseki, whereby Taiwan passed into Japanese hands until 1945.
Matsu Pitsu consists of three main structures, namely the Idiwatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room with the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings in the complex have been built from scratch in order to give tourists a better idea of what their original appearance was like.
30% of Machu Picchu had been restored by 1976 and its restoration continues to this day.
For example, the most common still image photography format is 35 mm worldwide, which was the dominant film size at the end of the analog film era.
It's still being produced today, but the most important thing is the proportions of dimensions that have been inherited from the image sensor shapes of the digital camera.
The 35mm format is actually 36mm wide, which is confusing, and 24mm high.
The dimension ratio of this arrangement (divided by twelve to get the simplest ratio of integers) is therefore 3:2.
Many common formats (the APS format category, for example) are equal to or close to these image ratios.
The law of three, often abused and ridiculed, is a simple guideline that creates dynamics while maintaining order down to one meter in an image.
It states that the most effective point for the main subject is at the intersection of the lines that divide the image into three parts vertically and horizontally (see example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, now possessing wealth and power, was put under control.
For more than a thousand years, the Christian religion has created an unbreakable bond between the European states despite any differences in language and customs.
His omnipresent power affected everyone from kings to ordinary mortals.
One of the main beliefs of Christianity is that wealth should be used to relieve the poor and those who suffer, and church funds are raised specifically for this purpose.
The central authority of the church had been based in Rome for over a thousand years, and this concentration of power and wealth led many to question whether the doctrine was being properly implemented.
Great Britain began blocking Germany from the sea immediately after the onset of the offensive.
The strategy has been effective, with cuts in vital military and civilian supplies, despite the fact that the blockade violated generally accepted international law, which has been codified in various international agreements over the past two centuries.
The United Kingdom has placed mines in international waters to prevent ships from moving anywhere on the sea, threatening even neutral ships.
Since there was limited reaction to this tactic, Germany expected the same for its unimpeded submarine warfare.
In the 1920's, the attitude adopted by most citizens and nations was peace and isolation.
The states, having seen the horror and atrocities of war during World War I, wanted to avoid a repeat of such a situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States of America to take a job with the Edison Company.
He arrived in the United States with 4 cents to his name, a book of poetry and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (director at his previous job) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of differentiating each distinct time period, and each stage of China or each ruling family was also a distinct dynasty.
Between each dynasty there was also an unstable period of divided provinces, the most famous of which was the Three Kingdoms period, which lasted for 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
In those times there was a fierce war between many nobles vying for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest periods in ancient Chinese history, as thousands of people lost their lives fighting for the throne of the great palace in Xi'an.
The social and political consequences are many, and they include the use of the metric system, a shift from authoritarianism to democracy, patriotism, and the belief that the country does not belong to a single ruler, but to the whole people.
Also, after the Revolution, professions were open to all men seeking work, enabling the most ambitious and successful to succeed.
The same was true of the army, as instead of classification by category, it was now done by diameter.
The French Revolution also inspired many other oppressed working-class individuals in other countries to start their own revolution.
Muhammad was intensely interested in matters beyond this worldly life, and he often visited a cave that became known as Hira on Mount Nur (Light) for meditation.
The cave itself, where he survived the time, provides a very vivid picture of Muhammad's spiritual inclination.
The cave is far from the world as it is located on the edge of a hill north of Mecca.
In fact, it's not at all easy for someone to find it even if they know it exists.
Nothing is visible beyond the clear, beautiful sky and the many surrounding mountains.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the seven wonders still standing today.
The Great Pyramid, built by the Egyptians in the 3rd century B.C., is one of many large pyramid-shaped structures built in honor of the dead pharaohs.
The plain of Giza, or "Necropolis of Giza" in Egypt's Valley of the Dead, has several pyramids (the largest of which is the pyramid of Khufu), some small tombs, several temples, and the great Sphinx.
The great pyramid was built in honor of Pharaoh Khufu, and many of the smaller pyramids in size, as well as the smaller tombs and temples were built in honor of Khufu's wife and family members.
The sign that says the bow should move upwards looks like a V, and the sign that says the bow should move downwards looks like a wire or a square without a bottom.
Playing up means that you have to start at the edge, pushing the bow, and playing down means that you have to start at the frog (the point where your hand holds the bow) and pull it.
Playing the bow upwards produces a softer sound, while playing it downwards is louder and more dynamic.
You are free to put your own notes, but keep in mind that the ones that are there perform some musical function, so they often need to be taken into account.
On October 6, 1789, a mob of market women forced King Louis XIV, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (eleven-year-old Marie Th√©r√®se and four-year-old Louis Charles) and the king's sister, Madame √âlisabeth, who had been terrorized, back from Versailles to Paris.
They traveled back to Paris in a carriage surrounded by a crowd of people screaming and threatening the King and Queen.
The crowd forced the King and Queen to open the windows of their carriage.
At one point, a person in the crowd began to shake the head of a member of the royal guard who had been killed at Versailles, before the eyes of the terrified queen.
The expenses of the United States' imperialist war for the conquest of the Philippines were paid by the Filipino people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the colonial regime of the United States to cover a large part of the costs and the interest rate on the bonds was stimulated on behalf of the Philippine government through the banking houses of Wall Street.
Of course, the superprofits resulting from the long exploitation of the Filipino people were to be the main profits of American imperialism.
To understand the Knights, one must understand the context that led to the formation of the order.
The time period in which these events occurred is often called the Late Middle Ages, the period of European history in the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1,000-1,300 A.D.).
The High Middle Ages followed the Early Middle Ages and preceded the Late Middle Ages, which by convention ends around 1500.
Technological rationality is a term that encompasses a variety of ideas in practice, from the promotion or enforcement of technology, to the strict interpretation that the future of humanity is governed by an underlying logic directly linked to scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two central ideas: that the development of technology itself follows a course largely away from cultural and political influence, and that technology in turn influences indigenous societies rather than societies adapted to the present.
For example, one might argue that the car necessarily leads to the development of roads.
However, a national road network is not economically viable for a small number of vehicles, so new production methods are being developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
The collective ownership regime also leads to higher rates of road accidents, which in turn leads to new methods in health care for the rehabilitation of physical injuries.
Romanticism had an important element of cultural determinism, originating from writers such as Goethe, Fichtel and Slegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography shaped people, and over time customs and cultural elements emerged in connection with this geography, which, being in harmony with the position of society, were better than arbitrarily imposed laws.
Just as Paris is considered the source of style in the modern era, so too is Constantinople the corresponding European source during the feudal era.
Its reputation as a center of abundance began to spread around 400 C.E. and lasted until about 1100 C.E.
Its prestige declined in the twelfth century, largely due to the Crusaders who brought back materials such as silk and spices, which were of higher value than the products of the Byzantine markets.
It was then that the title of Fashion Capital was transferred from Istanbul to Paris.
The Gothic style reached its heyday between the 10th and 11th centuries, as well as the 14th century.
At first the dress was strongly influenced by Byzantine culture in the east.
However, the slow communication channels meant a 25 to 30 year delay in the west.
By the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe was starting to develop its own style, and one of the most important developments of the time, which came as a result of the Crusades, was that people started to fasten their clothes with buttons.
Maintenance farming is farming that takes place to produce enough food to meet only the needs of the farmer and his/her family.
Survival farming is a simple, usually organic system of using stored seeds from the local ecosystem, combined with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to maximize yield.
Traditionally, farmers were mostly engaged in subsistence farming, and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together like-minded individuals who feel marginalized by social norms, enabling them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures are divided by age, origin, social class, location and/or racial discrimination.
The qualities that make a subculture distinctive can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or a combination of factors.
To mark their identity, members of a subculture often adopt a distinctive and symbolic style, which includes various fashions, particular behaviors, and art.
A key technique for meaningful socialization is to rely on the few unfortunate incidents of children who, due to neglect, misfortune or abuse, did not associate with adults during their lifetime.
Some wild children have been isolated by humans, usually by their own parents, and in some cases this abandonment of the child was due to the rejection by the parents due to the child's severe mental or physical disability.
Wild children are likely to have experienced severe abuse or traumatic experiences before they were abandoned or before they fled.
Others are said to have been raised by animals; some are thought to have lived alone in the wild.
A wild child, when raised entirely by animals without any contact with humans, exhibits behaviors (within natural limits) that are almost entirely similar to those of the particular animal that cared for it, such as its fear or indifference to humans.
While project-based teaching makes learning easier and more interesting, aids go a step further.
Worms are not a way of learning but rather a helping hand to people who are subjected to a new learning experience, such as learning a new computer program or starting a new project.
There are virtual and real bugs, in other words, the teacher is a form of bug, but the same is true for the human-linker in Microsoft Office.
Virtual aids are integrated into the software and are intended to ask, promote and explain processes which may have been very difficult for students to handle.
Children are placed in the care of foster parents for a variety of reasons, ranging from neglect and abuse to even blackmail.
No child should ever be raised in an environment without care, love and education, but it does happen.
We see the foster care system as a safe zone for these children.
The foster care system we have is supposed to provide safe homes, caring caregivers, stable education, and affordable health care.
The child's foster care is supposed to provide all the needs that the child did not receive in the home from which he or she was removed.
The Internet includes elements of both mass and interpersonal communication.
The specific characteristics of the Internet result in additional dimensions in terms of the approach to use and reward.
For example, learning and socializing are considered important motivators for using the Internet (James et al., 1995).
'Personal involvement' and 'continuous relationships' were also identified as aspects of push by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when investigating audience reactions to websites.
Video has made important discoveries in understanding microscopic expressions, our expressions that are infinitesimal.
In particular, it is said that one can detect whether a person is lying by correctly interpreting small expressions.
Oliver Sachs in his essay entitled "The President's Speech" reports that individuals who cannot understand speech because of brain damage are able, however, to discern honesty accurately.
It is further believed that these abilities to understand human behavior are present in animals such as domestic dogs.
A twentieth-century study showed that there are two forms of genetic diversity, latent and expressed.
Mutation adds new genetic variants and selection removes them from the pool of expressed variants.
Distinction and mixing redistribute the diversity between the two sides in each family.
Outside the savannah, it is difficult for a primitive mammal with a digestive system like ours to satisfy its need for amino acids from available plant resources.
Moreover, their failure to do so had serious consequences: declining growth, malnutrition and eventually death.
The most readily available plant resources would be proteins that can attach to leaves and pollen, but they're difficult for primitive mammals like us to digest unless they cook.
In contrast, animal feeds (ants, termites, eggs) are not only digestible but also important sources of protein, containing all the essential amino acids.
All things considered, it's not surprising that our ancestors faced the same protein demand as the chimpanzees in the savannah right now.
Interruption of sleep is the process of waking up consciously during the normal sleep period and falling back to sleep shortly afterwards (10-60 minutes).
This can easily be done by using a relatively quiet alarm clock, so that you can regain consciousness without being fully awake.
If you catch yourself turning off the alarm clock while you're sleeping, you can place it on the other side of the room, so you have to get up to turn it off.
Other biorhythm-based choices include drinking plenty of fluids (especially water or tea, known for its diuretic properties) before bedtime to force the dog to get up to urinate.
The amount of inner peace a person has is inversely proportional to the amount of tension in his body and spirit.
The less stress, the better the life force that is present. Each individual has the potential to find absolute peace and pleasure.
Anyone can achieve enlightenment, and the only obstacles to that goal are the tension and negativity of each of us.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but has been expanded by the path of love of Mahayana and many techniques of Indian yoga.
Tibetan Buddhism, in principle, is very simple. It consists of Kundalini yoga, meditation and the path of love that embraces all.
In Kundalini yoga, the Kundalini (enlightening) energy is awakened through movements, inhalation and exhalation practices, mantras and visualizations.
The focus of Tibetan meditation is the deity Yoga. Through the vision of various deities, energy channels are cleansed, chakras are activated and enlightened consciousness is created.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, leading to cooperation between the USSR and the USA.
As the war had been over for two years, the former allies were now enemies, and the Cold War began.
It would last for 40 years and have proxy warfare at battle points from Africa to Asia, to Afghanistan, to Cuba, and many other places.
By September 17, 1939, the Polish defences had already broken, and their only hope was to retreat and rebuild in the Romanian bulwark.
However, these plans were dashed in almost an overnight period when more than 800,000 Soviet Red Army soldiers entered and created the Belarus and Ukraine fronts, having invaded eastern Polish territories in violation of the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact and other international treaties, both bilateral and multilateral.
The use of ships for the transport of goods is by far the most efficient way of moving large parts of the population and goods across the ocean.
The work of the Navy has long been about ensuring that your country can transport your people and goods, while at the same time preventing your enemy from transporting his people and goods.
One of the most notable recent examples was the North Atlantic campaign during World War II, where the Americans were trying to move men and supplies across the Atlantic to help Britain.
At the same time, the German navy, using mostly submarines, tried to disrupt this traffic.
If the Allies failed, the Germans could probably conquer Britain as they did the rest of Europe.
Goats were probably first domesticated in the Zagros Mountains of Iran 10,000 years ago.
Ancient cultures and tribes are beginning to keep them for easy access to milk, wool, meat and skin.
Domesticated goats were generally kept in herds that roamed hills or other pastures, often looked after by shepherds, usually children or teenagers, the equivalent of the more widely known shepherds.
Wooden tracks were built in England as early as the 16th century.
Although the wooden rails consisted only of parallel wooden planks, these allowed the horses to pull the wagons to achieve greater speeds and to pull larger loads than on the few rougher roads of the day.
Wooden rack connections appeared early enough and were intended to hold the railway tracks in place, but gradually it became apparent that the rails would be much more functional with an iron support at the top.
This was a common method, but the iron created greater compression on the wheels of the wooden wagons.
Eventually, wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels, and in 1767 the first railway lines made entirely of iron appeared.
The first known means of transport was walking, people began walking upright two million years ago with the appearance of Homo Erectus (meaning standing man).
Their ancestors, the Australopithecines, did not walk upright as is customary.
Evidence of bipedal movement has been found in fossil apes from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, although Sackleton may have walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We have the potential to lead more sustainable lives, to become part of the environmental movement, and maybe to become activists to somehow mitigate the problems of the future.
It's like treating symptoms in many cases, but if we don't want a temporary treatment, we're going to have to find the source of the problems and neutralize them.
It is quite evident that the world has changed a lot because of mankind's scientific and technological advances, and that the problems have grown because of overpopulation and wasteful lifestyles.
After it was approved by Congress on July 4th, the handwritten note signed by Speaker John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thompson was sent a few blocks away to John Dunlap's printing press.
Overnight, 150 to 200 copies were printed, also known as the Dunlap Prosecutors.
The first public reading of the document was given by John Nixon on July 8 in the outdoor space of Independence Hall.
A copy was sent on July 6 to George Washington, who had it read to his troops in New York on July 9. Another arrived in London on August 10.
The 25 Dunlap pamphlets that we know still exist are the earliest surviving copies of the document.
Many paleontologists today believe that a species of dinosaur survived to the present day.
Not many people see them as dinosaurs because they have feathers that have the ability to fly.
But there's a lot of things about birds that make them look like dinosaurs.
They have legs with scales and claws, lay eggs, and walk on two legs like Tyrannosaurus Rex.
Computers now rely on the management of information encoded in binary systems.
To use computer terminology, a binary number can take only one or two values, which is 0 or 1, and those numbers are called binary digits or bits.
Internal intoxication may not be immediately apparent, and symptoms such as vomiting are sufficiently common to make an immediate diagnosis impossible.
The most valid sign that someone has been poisoned internally is an open bottle of medicine or some toxic household chemical in the room.
Read the label for specific first aid indications for this particular poison.
The term korea is officially used by etymologists for this group of insects.
The term comes from the ancient people's familiarity with bedbugs, which were insects that easily adapted to parasitize humans.
The killer insect and the bug are plutoid, adapted to live in the nest or enclosure of their host.
In the United States of America, there are about 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), making it the leading neurological disorder among the young and middle-aged.
Multiple sclerosis is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which includes the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerves.
Research shows that women are twice as likely to develop multiple sclerosis as men.
Two partners may decide that raising a baby is not in their best interests or in the best interests of the child they have.
These couples can plan an adoption for their baby.
In adoption the biological parents terminate their parental rights so that another couple can raise the child.
A basic goal of science is to understand how the world works through the scientific method, which essentially guides most scientific research.
But there is more to it than experimentation, and in particular an experiment is a test that is conducted to disprove one or more possible hypotheses, and asking questions and observing also guides scientific research.
Physicists and philosophers focused on classical texts, particularly the Latin version of the Bible.
Aristotle's positions on scientific matters, including psychology in them, enjoyed acceptance.
As the Greek intellectual lost ground, the West was cut off from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many observed that often the rhythms recorded in physiology and behavior depend on the existence of endogenous cycles, as well as their production by biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms, which are not simply responses to external periodic signals, have been recorded for most living things, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators, continuing their cycle even when they are not subject to external stimuli.
The Hersey and Chase experiment was one of the main suggestions that DNA is genetic material.
Hershey and Chase took phages, or germs, to put their genetic material into a bacterium.
They conducted two experiments in which they marked either the DNA in the phage using radioactive phosphorus or the phage protein using radioactive sulfur.
Mutations may have a wide variety of different effects depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the part of the genetic material affected and whether the affected cells are stem cells.
Only mutations in stem cells can be passed on to offspring, as mutations in other cells can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature tourism attracts people who naturally seek out landscapes to enjoy nature, along with the wild flora and fauna of the area.
Examples of activities in a given location are hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, and visiting parks, as well as studying information about the ecosystem.
For example, some visit, take pictures, and learn about the Bornean orangutans.
Every morning, people leave small towns in their cars to go to their workplace and meet others, whose work destination is the place the first ones just left.
In dynamic shuttle transport everyone is connected to each other in some way and supports a transport system based on private vehicles.
Today, science shows that this huge carbon economy has taken the biosphere out of a stable state that has supported the evolution of the human species for the last two million years.
Every individual is a part of society and uses some transportation system, and almost everyone complains about transportation systems.
In developed countries, complaints of the same level about water quality or the collapse of bridges are rarely heard.
Why do transport systems cause such complaints, why do they fail every day? Are transport engineers simply incompetent? Or is something more fundamental to blame?
Traffic flow is the analysis of the movement of specific drivers and cars between two places and the interactions that occur between them.
Unfortunately, the study of traffic flow is not easy, as it is impossible to predict with complete certainty the behaviour of drivers.
Fortunately, drivers tend to behave within a range of reasonable consistency; thus, traffic flows tend to have some logical consistency and can be approximated mathematically.
In order to better represent traffic intensity, relationships have been established between the three main characteristics: (1) intensity, (2) density and (3) speed.
These relationships helped in the preparation, design and operation of the road network installations.
The first animals to take off were insects, whose ability to fly helped them to avoid enemies more easily and find food and mate more effectively.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings along their body backwards.
This provides them with a greater variety of small hiding places than predators.
Now, the only insects that can't fold their wings are the butterflies and the newspaper flies.
Many years ago, Aristotle reported that the solar system was rotating perimeter of the sun.
Some believed he was right, but many believed the opposite, that the solar system moved around the Earth and the Sun (even around other stars).
It makes sense, since the Earth doesn't seem to be moving, right?
The Amazon River is the second longest and largest river in the world, carrying more than eight times as much water as the second longest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river in the world, sometimes reaching six miles.
20% of the water that Earth's rivers discharge into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The Amazon's main river is 6,387 kilometers (3,980 miles) long and gathers water from thousands of smaller rivers.
While stone pyramids continued to be built until the end of the Old Kingdom, none surpassed the pyramids of Giza in size and technical sophistication in construction.
Ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom period were impressed by the monuments of their ancestors, which were then over a thousand years old.
With a population of about 800, Vatican City is the smallest independent state in the world and the least populous.
The Vatican uses the Italian language in its legislation and official announcements.
Italian is also used in everyday life by most people working for the state, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All the citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholics.
Man has known of the existence of basic chemicals such as gold, silver, and copper since ancient times, since all of these can be found in nature in their raw form and are relatively easy to extract with primitive tools.
The philosopher Aristotle believed that everything is created by the mixing of one or more of the four elements, namely, earth, water, air, and fire.
It looked mostly like the four forms of matter (in this sequence): solid, water, air and plasma, although he also assumed that they were transformed into new substances to form this presence.
Alloy is essentially a mixture of two or more metals.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered metals.
There are also alloys that contain small amounts of nonmetallic elements such as carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter, all matter is made of very small particles, atoms.
The size of atoms is so extremely small that trillions of them could fit in the dot at the end of this sentence.
So, the pencil when it came out became a good friend to many.
Unfortunately, as newer writing methods have appeared, the place and usefulness of the pencil has been degraded.
People now write messages on computer screens without ever having to grab a scratch.
One might wonder what will become of the keyboard when something new comes along.
The fission bomb is based on the principle that it takes energy to form a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
It's like a heavy cart rolling up a hill, and by tearing the core apart again, some of that energy is released.
Some individuals have unstable nuclei, and this leads to their breaking up if little or no pressure is applied.
The surface of the Moon is made up of rocks and dust.
The crust is about 70 kilometers thick on the near side and about 100 kilometers on the far side.
It's thinner under the seas and thicker under the plateaus.
There might be more seas nearby because the crust is thinner, and the lava could better go to the surface that way.
Content theories focus on discovering what makes people click or what attracts them.
These theories argue that individuals have certain needs and/or desires that have become internalized as they mature and reach adulthood.
These theories study what makes certain people want what they want and what is in their environment that will lead them to do or not do certain things.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs and Herzberg's two-factor theory.
In general, two behaviors can occur when managers start to guide their former peers.
This type of manager has difficulty making unpopular decisions, taking disciplinary action, performing evaluations, assigning responsibilities, and putting people ahead of their responsibilities.
At the other end of the spectrum, one can become a stranger who feels that he or she must change everything the group has done and make it his or her own.
After all, the one ultimately responsible for the success and failure of the team is the leader.
This behavior often results in a rift between the leader and the rest of the group.
Virtual groups are created with the same principles of propriety as conventional groups, but there are slight differences.
Virtual team members often act as a link to their immediate physical team.
Often, they are more autonomous than conventional group members, as their groups may meet according to different time zones, which may not be acceptable to their local administration.
The existence of a truth group (Larson and La Fasto, 1989, p. 109) is another unique element of a virtual group.
Each is presented to the 'visible management team', which sets the standards for all participants.
Why would an organisation want to go through this time-consuming process of establishing learning of organisational capabilities? One of the goals for the practical application of organisational capability learning concepts is innovation.
Creativity and intelligence are fostered when all available resources are appropriately used in the functional parts of an organization.
As a result, the process in which an organisation works together to overcome an obstacle can lead to new innovative processes in favour of meeting the needs of the customer.
In order for an organisation to be innovative, management must create an environment for innovation, knowledge exchange and organisational learning.
The explanation given by Engel (2006) for the continuous learning approach describes it as a method used to help organisations to gauge their level of performance.
Neurobiological evidence provides physical evidence for a theoretical study of cognition, so it narrows the scope of the research by making it clearer.
The relationship between brain pathology and behavior is a help to researchers and their study.
It has long been known that various types of brain damage, injuries, injuries, and tumors affect behavior and may cause changes in certain mental functions.
The emergence of new technologies allows us to see and explore brain structures and processes that humans have never seen before.
This provides us with a lot of information and material to create simulation models that will help us understand the processes that are going on in our minds.
Although AI is largely a science fiction reference, it is nevertheless an important branch of computing that deals with adapting behavior, learning and intelligence to a machine.
Artificial intelligence research involves the construction of machines for the purpose of automating tasks requiring intelligent behavior.
Examples include checking, programming, responding to diagnoses and customer inquiries, as well as handwriting recognition, spoken speech recognition and facial recognition.
These are now separate institutions, focused on providing solutions to real problems of everyday life.
AI is now commonly used in the financial, healthcare, engineering and military sectors, and is embedded in various home computer software applications and computer games.
Excursions are an important part of every classroom, and very often a teacher would want to take his students to places where bus access is not an option.
Technology offers the solution with virtual tours, where students can see museum exhibits, visit an aquarium, or admire beautiful artwork while in class.
In fact, taking part in an excursion is also an important opportunity to reflect on the trip and share experiences with future classes.
For example, every year students from the Bennet School in North Carolina design a website about their trip to the state capital, and every year it is updated, but the old versions are kept online and serve as a reference book.
Blogs can also help improve a student's writing.While students' experience of blogging often starts with poor grammar and spelling, audience presence generally changes that.
Since students are often the most critical audience, the blog editor begins to do his best to improve his writing style in order to avoid criticism.
Also, blogging "forces students to become more understanding about the world around them". The need to keep the public interested inspires students to become intelligent and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Web hosting is a technique that promotes teamwork and encourages students to learn more than what they are taught in the morning.
The correct use of blogs can encourage students to use more analytical and critical thinking, as through active response to online material, students can define their positions in the context of other people's texts as well as express their own views on specific issues (Oravek, 2002).
Ottawa is the enchanting, bilingual capital of Canada which includes a wide range of galleries and museums highlighting Canada past and present.
Further south are the Niagara Falls and further north is the unspoiled natural beauty of Muscoca and beyond.
All of this and more characterizes Ontario as the quintessence of Canadian character as it is perceived by foreigners.
Large areas in the even northernmost part are quite sparsely populated, while some are almost uninhabited wilderness areas.
For a population comparison that surprises many: There are more African Americans living in the United States than there are Canadians.
The islands of East Africa are located in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest and is a continent in its own right in terms of its wildlife species.
Almost all of the islets are independent or of French origin, and are renowned for providing quaint sea shelters.
The Arabs also brought Islam to the region and it spread to a large extent to the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonization began in the 15th century when Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama traced the route that makes up the Cape complex and leads from Europe to India.
The area is bounded to the north by the Sahel, while the Atlantic Ocean borders it on the south and west side of the site.
Women: It is recommended that every woman who travels declare herself married, regardless of her actual marital status.
It also helps to wear a ring (just not one that looks too expensive.
Women should understand that cultural differences can lead to acts that would be considered harassment and it is not uncommon for women to be chased, held by the hand, etc.
Be firm when rejecting a man and do not be afraid to defend your position (cultural differences or not, no excuse!).
The modern city of Casablanca was established by Berber fishermen in the 10th century B.C. and became a strategic port for the Phoenicians, Romans, and Merenids, who named it Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it as Casa Branca, only to abandon it after an earthquake in 1755.
The Moroccan Sultan rebuilt the city and named it Daru I-Batija, while the name Casablanca was given by Spanish traders who established trading bases there.
Casablanca is one of the least market-oriented places in all of Morocco.
It's easy to find places around the old Medina that sell traditional Moroccan goods like tazin, pottery, leather goods, coconuts and a wide range of snacks, but they're all touristy.
Goma is a city in the Democratic Republic of Congo with a high tourist traffic in the eastern end near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was devastated by the eruption of the volcano, which covered almost all the streets of the city, especially the city center.
While Goma is relatively safe, any visit outside Goma should be studied to understand the situation of the ongoing conflicts in the province of North Kivu.
The city is also a stopover for climbing the Nyiragongo volcano along with some of the cheapest mountain gorilla tracking and observation programs in Africa.
You can use the boda-boda (motorcycle taxi) to get around Goma.
Combined with its relative inaccessibility, Tibukt≈´ has acquired the metaphorical meaning of the exotic, distant country.
Today, Timbuktu is a poor city, despite its reputation as a tourist attraction and airport.
In 1990 it was added to the list of World Heritage Sites in Danger, threatened by desert sand.
This is one of the most important stops during the Henry Louis Gates show on PBS about the particular wonders of the African world.
The city is completely different from other cities in the country, as it has mostly an Arab air and not an African one.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is in the northern and eastern part of South Africa and is on the border line with Mozambique at the eastern point, Zimbabwe at the northern end, while its southern border is considered the Crocodile River.
The park covers 19,500 km2 and is divided into 14 different areas of ecological interest each supporting different species of wildlife.
It is one of the most notable attractions in South Africa and is referred to as the emblem of South African National Parks (SANParks).
As with all South African National Parks, there are day-trip entrance tickets for the park.
It may be beneficial for someone to buy a Wild Card, which provides access to either selected South African parks or all of its national parks.
Hong Kong Island is also the name of Hong Kong territory and is a magnet for many visitors.
The splendor of the buildings that make up Hong Kong's cityscape has been likened to a glittering bar chart highlighted by the presence of the waters of Victoria Harbor.
For a better view of Hong Kong, leave the island and cross over to Kaulon Pier.
Urban development on Hong Kong Island has for the most part been concentrated in high density in arid areas along the northern coast.
This is the place where the British colonists occupied, and so if you're looking for evidence of the colonial past of the area, it's a good place to start.
Sundarbans is the largest coastal mangrove forest in the world, extending 50 miles [80 km] from the coastline of mainland Bangladesh and India.
The Sandarbansh has been declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO. The part of the forest located on Indian soil is called Sandarbansh National Park.
But the forests are not just mangrove swamps; they include some of the last remnants of the mighty jungle that once covered the plain of the Ganges.
Sundarbans covers an area of 3,850 square kilometres, of which about one third is covered by water/elevation zones.
Since 1966 Sundarbans has been a wildlife refuge, and it is estimated that there are now 400 Bengal tigers and some 30,000 deer.
Buses depart from the inter-regional station (across the river) throughout the day, although most, especially those heading east and towards Jakarta/Boomtang depart between 06:30 and 07:30.
Because buses between regions are usually full, it is recommended that you book your ticket a few days in advance.
Most areas are served by small Japanese Coaster buses, which are characterized by their comfort and durability.
Shared taxis are a quick and convenient way to travel to nearby places, such as Paro (150 ngultrums) and Punaha (200 ngultrums).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge that spans the Oyapock River connecting the cities of Oiapoque, Brazil, and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock, French Guiana.
The two towers are 83 meters high, 378 meters long, and have two hallways 3.50 meters wide.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 metres. Construction was completed in August 2011 and it was closed to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is scheduled to be fully operational in September 2017, when the Brazilian customs checkpoints are expected to be completed.
The Guarani were the most important indigenous group inhabiting the lands now known as eastern Paraguay, and lived as semi-groups of hunters who also engaged in subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region was home to other indigenous tribal groups such as the Guaicuru and the Paiwa, who survived by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
In the 16th century Paraguay, formerly called the "Giant Province of the Indians", was born as a result of the quarrel between the Spanish conquistadors and the indigenous groups.
The colonial period, which lasted three centuries, began with the Spanish.
Since the founding of Asunci√≥n in 1537, Paraguay has managed to retain much of its indigenous character and identity.
Argentina is famous for having one of the best polo teams and players in the world.
The main tournament each year takes place in the last month of the year in the Las Canitas water-ski pools.
Here you can watch smaller tournaments and matches at other times of the year.
For news about tournaments and ticket sales for water polo matches, check the Argentine Polo Association.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland pound (FKP), whose value is equal to the value of the British pound (GBP).
You can exchange currency at the only bank on the islands which is located in Stanley across from the FIC West store.
The British pound is generally accepted everywhere on the islands and Stanley credit cards as well as US dollars are usually accepted.
In remote islands credit cards will probably not be accepted, although British and American currency may be accepted; ask the owners in advance to find out which payment methods are accepted.
It's almost impossible to convert Falkland currency outside the islands, so you do the currency conversion before you leave the islands.
Since Montevideo is south of the equator, it is summer when it is winter in the northern hemisphere and vice versa.
Montevideo is in the subtropical zone, and temperatures above 30 ¬∞C are common in summer.
Cold in winter is misleading: temperatures rarely drop below freezing, but wind and humidity combine to create the feeling that it's colder than the thermometer shows.
There are no particularly rainy and dry seasons: the amount of rainfall remains almost the same throughout the year.
Although many of the park's animals are accustomed to human presence, their wild nature remains wild, so we should not feed or disturb them.
According to park authorities, keep at least 100 yards per meter away from bears and wolves and 25 yards per meter away from all other wildlife!
As calm as bison may seem, Canadian deer, elk, bears, and almost all large animals can still attack.
Every year, dozens of visitors are injured because they don't keep proper distances, and these animals are big, wild, and can become dangerous, so leave them alone.
Also, keep in mind that smells attract bears and other wildlife, so avoid carrying or cooking food with strong smells and keep the campsite clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa, a city on the island of Upolu with a population of nearly 40,000.
Apia was founded in 1850, and since 1959 has been the official capital of Samoa.
A famous naval showdown had taken place in the harbor in 1889, when seven ships from Germany, the United States, and Britain refused to leave it.
All but one British cruiser was sunk, and about 200 American and German lives were lost.
During the independence struggle organized by the Mao movement, a peaceful rally in the city resulted in the assassination of the Tupu Supreme Leader Tamasese Liaolofi III.
There are many beaches, as Auckland has two harbors.
The North Shore beaches (in the North Harbor district) are found from the Pacific Ocean and extend from Long Bay in the North to Devonport in the South.
Almost all are sandy beaches suitable for safe swimming, and most are shaded by pohucuwa trees.
The beaches of Tamaki Drive are in the Waitemata Harbour of the luxury suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers in Central Auckland.
These beaches are sometimes crowded with families with a variety of shops along the coast.
The main local beer is called Number One and is not a complex beer, but it is pleasant and refreshing.
A wide variety of French wines are available for tasting, but wines from New Zealand and Australia may be a better choice.
Local tap water is perfectly safe to drink, but if you're afraid, you can easily find bottled water.
In Australia, the idea of flat white coffee is foreign. Short black is espresso, cappuccino is inflated with cream instead of foam, and tea is drunk without milk.
Hot chocolate is Belgian standard, and the fruit juices are expensive but amazing.
Throughout the year, many trips take place on the reef, and injuries due to any of these causes are rare on the reef.
Nevertheless, you take advice from the authorities, obey all signs, and pay close attention to safety warnings.
Since 1770, the bee-eaters have been making their appearance near beaches and river mouths from October to April, occasionally spotting them at different times of the year.
Sharks do exist, but they rarely attack humans, and most sharks are afraid of them and would swim away from them.
Sea crocodiles do not inhabit the sea, their primary natural habitat being the estuaries of rivers north of Rockhampton.
By booking early, it ensures travelers that they will have a place to stay once they reach their destination.
Travel agents often make deals with specific hotels, but you can also book through an agent for other forms of accommodation such as camping.
Travel agents usually offer packages that include breakfast, airport transfer arrangements or even combined flight and hotel packages.
Your application may be put on hold if you need time to reconsider the offer or to collect other travel documents (e.g. a visa).
However, any amendments or requests should first be referred to the travel agent and not sent directly to the hotel.
With regard to some festivals, most music festival attendees decide to camp there, and most consider it a very important part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the action, you should start early to find a camping spot close to the music.
Remember that while the music may end at the main stages, there may be parts of the festival where the music will continue into the late evening.
Some festivals provide special camping areas for families with young children.
If you are crossing the northern Baltic Sea in winter, check your cabin position, as the passage through ice creates terrible noises for those most affected.
The cruise to St. Petersburg contains the time you will stay in the city.
Casinos usually go to great lengths to maximize the time and money spent by guests, with windows and clocks missing and exits hard to find.
Often there are special offers on food, drink and entertainment to keep customers in good spirits and on the premises.
In some places, free alcoholic beverages are offered, but drunkenness affects judgment, and a good gambler knows the importance of remaining sober.
If you are going to drive at high altitudes or through mountain passes, you should consider the possibility of snow, ice, and very low temperatures.
On icy and snowy roads, there is little friction and it is difficult to drive compared to bare asphalt.
During a blizzard, it can snow so much that it traps you in a very short time.
Visibility may also be limited in snowfall, wet or ice at the vehicle windows.
On the other hand, ice and snow conditions are normal in many countries, where traffic continues mostly without interruption all year round.
Safaris are perhaps the biggest tourist attraction in Africa and a sight for many visitors.
The term safari is widely used as the land journey to visit the amazing African wildlife, especially the savanna.
Some animals, such as elephants and camels, tend to get too close to cars, and basic equipment will help with good visibility.
Lions, cat deer, and leopards are sometimes shy, and you'll see them better with glasses.
A walking safari (also called a bush walk or hiking safari) consists of hiking for either a few hours or a few days.
The Paralympic Games will take place from 24 August to 5 September 2021. Some events will be held in other locations across Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to have hosted the Summer Olympics twice, having hosted them in 1964.
If you've planned how you're going to fly and where you're going to stay for 2020 before it's announced that they're being postponed, you may be facing a difficult situation.
Cancellation policies vary, but since late March most coronavirus cancellation policies have not been extended to July 2020, when the Olympics were scheduled.
It is expected that most event tickets will cost between ¬•2,500 and ¬•130,000, with the price of standard tickets being about ¬•7,000.
Many hotels have irons and irons for rent, even if they are not in the room.
If no iron is available, or you are not interested in wearing ironed socks, you can use a hairpiece if available.
Be careful not to allow the fabric to overheat (which may cause shrinkage or, in extreme cases, burning).
There are several ways to purify water, and some are more effective against specific threats.
In some areas a minute of boiling water is sufficient, but in others it takes several minutes.
Filters vary in their effectiveness, and if you have any concerns, then you should consider the possibility of buying your water in a sealed bottle from a reputable company.
Travellers may encounter infectious animals that they are not used to encountering in areas of their country.
Parasites spoil food, cause irritation, or in the worst cases, cause allergic reactions, carry poison, and transmit infections.
Infectious diseases or wild animals that have the ability to brutally strike or kill humans are not often classified as harmful organisms.
Tax-free markets are an opportunity to source goods in certain locations without being subject to duties and excise duties.
Travelers heading to high-tax countries can sometimes save quite a bit of money, especially on products such as alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The section between Point Marion and Fairmont is very dangerous to drive on the Buffalo-Pittsburg Highway, because it crosses many lonely country places.
