Eemeli Kouki led the Hurricanes to their first home win of the season , a second win for Savo Volley .
Hurricane Loima, the seven-time men's world championship medalist, started the 2018-19 season with a 3-0 home defeat to Raision Loimu on Saturday.
Eemeli Kouki, the all-around player who returned from Romania to Finland, was the Hurricane's most effective player with 22 points.
There were some adjustments to the foreigners, but they didn't happen, and then there was a call from Loima.
"We got it done pretty quickly", said Kouki.
Like Hooke, Tom Drumman, who played in the Loymen, backed Hooke with 18 points.
The most effective guest was national team coach Samuli Kaislasalo, who was playing on a match-site contract with 17 points.
Winning the opening game is always important.
Many players had experience on the opposite side, and that added to the game.
We're not ready for the game yet, but of course, continuing the medal pipeline is the goal, Kouki said.
The most effective of the last Savo Volley
Miro Määttänen was 18 points stronger in Savo Volley when the team defeated the Vantaa Ducks 3-0 in the second half.
We had a rough game, especially on the offensive, but luckily we had a crushed win.
At least I didn't have any consciously different charges when I played against my former team, said the bastard.
In the 2000-01 season, Antti Siltala, who started his career in the 3rd series of the Futsal, scored 12 points.
Coach Jukka Tuovinen was happy with a lot of things.
The hall was small, so the atmosphere was on the roof all the time.
A good kid's been left out of the house.
Miro was a king, Sillik played a good game, said the Master.
His last season in the league was 2006-07, when he won silver at the Pielaveden Sammo while still the head coach of Tuovisen.
Thiago Maciel was the Ducks' top scorer with 14 points.
♪ My star is AKA-VOLLY again ♪
The 2012-13 league points winner Joni Mikkonen has started this season strong.
The hacker scored 25 points as Akaa-Volley took his first win of the season after defeating the Kokkola Tigers 3-2.
The season's started off pretty good on its own.
Today, of course, was a close loss, because we were fourth in the standings with a 17-21 loss.
We were digging a losing streak, and the fifth round came at the same time, Mikkonen said.
A few seasons ago, the Tigers' most productive quarterback was 28-point hitter Edwarts Buivids.
The landlord Aleksandrs Kudrjashov supported by 17 points.
There was hardly any sign of the guy's hacker, Mikkonen said.
Finland is the world's number one in terms of human capital
Finland is the world's leading producer of human capital, reports the Lancet.
The study compared human capital development from 1990 to 2016.
Over the years, 195 countries were compared.
Finland was the number one country in both statistics.
In 2016, the top five was almost the same as in 1990.
Finland was previously followed by Iceland, Denmark, Canada and the Netherlands.
Later, the Netherlands ranked one higher and Taiwan was added to the list instead of Canada.
In 2016, Niger and South Sudan were the worst performers.
The human capital measure takes into account the level of education, access to education, skills and health of the population.
The World Bank has identified the link between human capital and economic growth.
Real Madrid's Thibaut Courtois kept Atletico in the lead, local match ended goalless
Real Madrid goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois made his way to the top of the table, and the Madrid team's home game ended in a goalless draw late Saturday in the Spanish football league.
Atletico Madrid's Antoine Griezmann and Diego Costa were the closest finishers, but Belgian goalkeeper Courtois managed to fight.
Courtois spent three seasons at Atletico on loan as a Chelsea player.
In the first week of June, FIFA named him the FIFA World Cup Goalkeeper of the Year.
In real life, Gareth Bale was the best scorer, but his shot went past the goal in the opening half.
Bale was on the change after the break because of a hip injury.
According to ESPN, disappointed Real fans shouted the name of Cristiano Ronaldo at the match, even after he was drafted into Juventus.
The United States is now under attack for abortion rights, and a powerful document explains why.
The U.S. Senate is currently trying to determine whether Brett Kavanaugh, a candidate nominated by President Donald Trump, could be elected to the nine-member Supreme Court.
Many in the Republican Party are hoping that Kavanaugh's decisive vote will overturn the decision known as Roe v. Wade, which made abortion legal in the United States in 1973.
The documentary Reversing Roe by Ricki Stern and Annie Sundberg - The United States and Abortion Rights - tells how the current situation has evolved over the years.
As incredible as it may seem, the subject is relevant in Finland.
Minister Timo Soini (you) has been working to promote the fight against safe abortion and has received a wide range of support from the majority of our Members of Parliament.
At the beginning of this powerful document, we meet with gynecologist Colleen McNicholas, who, because of the tightening of the law, has become the only abortion doctor in the state of Missouri.
The hospital's armed guard says he's standing up for religious freedom in the United States.
The news videos are reminiscent of the deadly terrorist attacks on clinics.
Let's move on to a time when abortion was illegal in the United States.
At that time, the Lutheran Churchmen's Association directed women to reliable abortion doctors.
The reasoning of the interviewed pastor is good, but in fact it is not even necessary, a photograph of a woman who herself had an abortion is enough.
Deaths in the United States were about 5,000 years.
The Republican Party was a major supporter of legalizing abortion.
In California, the abortion law was signed by Governor Ronald Reagan in 1967.
Later, specifically in his 1980 presidential campaign, Reagan began to turn religion into politics to appeal to voters.
His abortion was also ruled out by his successor, George Bush Sr.
And Donald Trump did the same thing.
The most profound document of the case is found in the search for a justification for the politicization of the abortion case.
When religious organizations that supported racial segregation were denied tax exemption, they became politically active.
The choice was abortion.
Religion has brought extraordinary knots to politics.
At the time of writing, the United States is in a situation where the president, who has boasted of sexual harassment but has captured the voices of religious right by abortion, has chosen Kavanaugh, now accused by many women of sexual harassment, as the candidate for the Supreme Court.
Kavanaugh could have the power of the vague language to decide the rights of 164 million American women and girls.
Israeli army shot seven Palestinians, including two children, in a large demonstration on the border
Nearly 200 Palestinians have been killed in six months after Israel fired on protesters in the border zone.
Israeli soldiers shot seven Palestinians in the Gaza Strip on Friday, the Palestinian Health Ministry said.
According to the Palestinian Ministry of Health, two children are among the dead: boys aged 12 and 14.
The ministry said 505 people were injured.
89 of these were wounded by bullets.
The Israeli army has confirmed that it opened fire and launched a bombing raid on the border area as the protesters threw stones and explosives at Israeli troops.
The army says it has begun using force so that protesters do not break the border line or cross it.
At least 191 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza protests since March, when Palestinians began weekly border protests.
The UN Human Rights Commissioner said there were 12,000 wounded.
Protesters demanded that Palestinian families have access to the territories that Palestinians were forced to leave when the State of Israel was established in 1948.
A Palestinian sniper has killed one Israeli soldier.
Explosions dropped by Palestinian lions and helium balloons have set fire to forest and farmland in Israel.
The subject of the book got a kick in the head . He couldn 't shoot himself .
Wigan's top chey dunkley showed up knocking him down with a backpack in the penalty area.
Judge Gavin Ward gave the game a go.
According to his interpretation, the containment was clean.
The subject of the book couldn't believe his eyes.
I think that was a bit of a problem for Judge Ward, who sentenced Norwich to a penalty kick in the 85th minute when the Puck was dropped.
Ward showed a punishing touch, and Mario Vrancic scored a 1-0 win.
The kid's scored five touchdowns for Norwich in the World Series.
The last one was born last Saturday against QPR with a stylish breast muscle.
I'm sure the Poke's got a taste for the work again.
After he lost the ball, he continued until the end of the situation.
He created scoring situations and defended tirelessly.
It was the fifth game for Norwich in two weeks.
The team's still in the League Cup.
There's a five-win pipe in the back.
Pedophile assistance services were immediately filled with reservations - in Finland about 40,000 children are interested
An estimated two percent of men and a small percentage of women experience at least some sexual interest in their forepart.
This means about 40,000 people in Finland.
So far, it has been difficult for children or young people interested in sex to get help.
The SeriE project, a joint project between the Foundation for Criminal Care and Sexpo, trains professionals to deal with pedophiles as clients and helps people who have a sexual interest in children.
When the project was announced in the spring, counseling and therapy at Sexpo began, and the email and appointment sessions were quickly completed, Yle reports.
But they're promised to be released in the fall.
Sexual predilection for children is a source of shame for many.
Most of those who perceive pedophilic feelings in themselves have not realized their fantasies and thus have committed no crime.
However, a disposition is usually a permanent trait.
Most of them hope to get rid of the thoughts that upset and depress them.
They also make normal life difficult, says Patricia Thesleff, a sex therapist who works as a special expert on the project.
I think the job is valuable if one child is spared sexual violence, Thesleff says.
The Korean leaders or the Congolese gynecologist?
The idea of US President Donald Trump winning the Nobel Peace Prize may sound strange all of a sudden, but Trump is one of the most popular prize winners in terms of odds.
The background is Trump's role in getting North Korea to commit to a nuclear dispute, at least at the level of speeches.
The top winners of the Nobel Peace Prize are reportedly South Korean President Moon Jae-in and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, who have met three times this year and agreed to seek a peace treaty between their countries.
The warming between the two Koreas is remarkable, as last year was a good year.
Yet, the reward of Kim, who has been threatening the world with nuclear weapons for years and is fighting an iron fist, would undoubtedly also raise criticism.
The Nobel Prize winners will be announced from Monday, and the most attention-grabbing prize of the day will be the prize of peace on Friday.
If the prize is not awarded to those who have participated in the diplomatic activities of the Korean Peninsula, one of the top candidates is the Congolese doctor Denis Mukwege.
A respected gynecologist has treated thousands of women victims of mass abuse in a hospital in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and has become a world-leading expert in his field.
In his work, Mukwege has focused attention on sexual violence, a disastrous byproduct of many conflicts.
The United Nations refugee agency, which won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1954 and 1981, has also been considered a strong candidate.
The Nobel Committee has announced that this year there will be 331 nominees for the prize.
The names of the candidates will not be made public.
Trump himself wouldn't be upset if he got the Nobel.
In May, a reporter asked him at the White House if he thought he deserved the peace prize.
Everyone thinks so, but I would never say it myself, Trump said with a smile.
I want to finish this.
The prize I want is a win for the whole world, the president continued, referring to the North Korean negotiations.
But there are things that make Trump unlikely to win a Nobel.
The Norwegian Nobel Committee, which decides on the award, has often given recognition to individuals and organizations representing liberal democracy and the multilateral world order - the very kind of international cooperation that Trump has been seen as an opponent of.
In the 21st century, the award has been given to three American politicians who have all been Democrats: Jimmy Carter in 2002, Al Gore in 2007, and Barack Obama in 2009.
So, to award Trump would require a complete ideological transformation from the Nobel committee.
Fire alarm in the tunnel: Drivers behaved like cops and were driving in the wrong direction
The one-way traffic stop in the Dragon occurred on September 8.
The tunnel area was closed due to the announcement, both to Turin and Helsinki.
When it became clear that there was a systemic error, the fire department tried to make traffic normal.
But it didn't work out very quickly.
We tried to open the road once before, but the Transportation Centre said it couldn't because there's a shock of cars on the road and they're driving as it happens, a friend of the firefighter, Pasi Karyrian, told STT at the time.
At that time, the highway was being taken off even after a moment of waiting.
When the first one starts to violate traffic rules, a few others often follow, surprised by Transport Safety Communications Director Tapio Heiskanen.
Traffic rules say that motorways and tunnels must only stop for compulsory reasons.
The safety of transport reminds us that in emergency situations, it is not possible to start putting traffic at risk by emergency solutions.
The alert vehicles shall be allowed to pass as smoothly as possible.
In particular, driving in the opposite direction on the motorway is prohibited, as are making and cancelling the U-turn.
The same prohibitions apply to tunnels where the lights must be turned on at all times.
It is also forbidden to stop without compelling reason, as is, of course, parking.
Recently, there have even been instances of a driver stopping in a tunnel to brush the snow from his car.
It should be clear that this is the wrong place and time for this activity, Heiskanen said in a statement from the Transport Safety Board.
If the ship had been stuck at the bottom of the lake, the fans of Ilves would have wanted to keep on celebrating.
The Ilves fans, who were transported by the inland waterway M/S Tampere, would have liked to have stayed on the ship to continue their victory celebrations, even though the ship had been stuck in a cage at the bottom of the lake, says Juho Syrja, who was the ship's captain at the time of the event.
M/S Tampere, on his way to Tampere from the city of Hämeenstad, drove off his route late on Saturday night and was trapped on the bottom of the Old Town Water in the Aqaba.
The 19 passengers and five crew members on board were evacuated to the mainland at night.
No one was hurt in the barn.
The Ilves fans would have liked to have continued their party on the boat until morning, but it certainly made more sense to send them to the fire station by car to the port and bus home, Syrja told STT.
The fans had been in Hammenstad to watch Ilves and HPK play, which ended in Ilves' 4-3 victory.
According to the judge, the Saturday storm was caused by the water level at Vanajavader being about half a meter below normal.
Sirj also said that navigation was hindered by the fact that the nearest sign was covered in logs, and therefore its reflectors could not normally be seen in the dark.
No more collision to mention.
The wreck occurred on the western side of the narrow Jumusensalmen shortly after the naval route had crossed the Tampere-Helsinki motorway bridge.
Sirj did not consider the incident to be more dramatic, as the speed of the ship was very low at the time of the incident and the impact on the bottom did not cause the more serious impact.
According to the official, the bottoming has not caused any leaks or weight loss and the cruises of the vessel in these visions will continue normally.
The diver went in on Saturday morning to check on the ship before the ship started to price off the bottom.
We're still going to the yard to make sure there's no damage, Syrja says.
The offender believes that the next cruise, scheduled for next weekend in Tampere, can be handled in an agreed manner.
He says the cruise season will continue until Independence Day.
Not for use in ambulances
The rescue team received an alert about the incident just after 12:30 on Saturday night.
Ambulance services were alerted to the port of Viiala to receive evacuated passengers, but no ambulance was available.
Late that evening, Matti Willman, a firefighter with whom I had been friends, told me that evacuation conditions on the lake were difficult because of the darkness and the rather strong winds.
The Pirkanmaa rescue service announced at 3:30 pm on the night before Sunday that all on board had been evacuated and the passengers had been transferred by bus to Tampere.
The cruiser, built in 1957, has been refurbished in 2001, 2014 and 2017.
Trump's nominee for judge on charges of harassment and drunkenness may be stripped of his top job.
Brett Kavanaugh, nominated to serve as a U.S. Supreme Court justice, may well be out of office, says program director Mika Aaltola of the Foreign Policy Institute.
So far, at least three women have accused Kavanaugh of sexual harassment and inappropriate behavior during his studies.
According to Waaltola, the suspicions have put so much political pressure on the Republican Party that President Donald Trump may end up running for office with someone else.
In the United States, there have been occasional incidents in the past where a presidential nominee for Supreme Court justice has caused a great deal of controversy.
In such cases, the candidate for judge will usually have himself withdrawn, Aaltola says.
That's how the president has been able to keep his face.
The Democratic Party would be 100th.
The U.S. Supreme Court is trying to be above politics, but at least in Kavanaugh's case, the election of a new judge has become a politically sensitive process.
If Kavanaugh is elected, the decision will likely rain down the Democratic Party in the upcoming midterm congressional elections, according to Aaltola.
It would raise voter turnout among young people and women who would be more likely to vote for Democrats.
On the other hand, the appointment of a conservative judge to the Supreme Court would be a long-term win for the Republicans.
The opportunity to be appointed does not come with every term of office, because in the United States, the Supreme Court is a lifetime appointment.
In practice, some of them have abandoned their own application for retirement at about 70 or 80 years of age.
Some Republicans are also hesitant to nominate him .
"The candidates for the U.S. Supreme Court are normally subject to background checks", Aaltola said.
Even though Trump has only given the FBI a week to respond to the additional investigation, Aaltola says it could still bring something significant to light.
It might.
"There is hardly any smoke without fire", says Aaltola.
Mr Aaltola said that the fact is that Kavanaugh's eligibility or unfitness for office will be discussed more vigorously before the Senate makes its decision.
Republicans have a majority in the Senate, 51-49, but at least two female Republican senators say Kavanaugh's nomination is questionable.
The most embarrassing thing would be for the nomination to go to the polls and the Republicans to lose.
A woman identified a suspected Salisbury as a military intelligence agent.
A Russian woman has told the BBC that she identified a Russian man suspected of poisoning in Salisbury as an agent of the Russian military intelligence service.
The woman told me from the photos that this is military intelligence, Anatoli Shepigi, who works for the GRU.
The online community Bellingcat and the Russian community Insider Russia have previously revealed that one of the men suspected of poisoning is Chepya.
Earlier, they said they had found evidence that men's current identities are undercover personalities.
A BBC team travelled to the Far East near the Russian-Chinese border, where Chepiga grew up.
A woman in the village recognized the pictures of a young man named Shepigan Bellingcat.
He identified the same man from British police photos of a man who now calls himself Ruslan Boshirov.
Russian officials are suspected of poisoning former double agent Sergei Skripal and his daughter with Novitshok nerve agent in March.
The Skripals survived.
Colonel Chepiga was awarded the title of Hero of Russia in 2014.
Russia still denies any connection to the suspected GRU.
The men suspected of poisoning said in an interview with Russian television earlier this September that they were tourists in Salisbury.
Old people in trash bags in the soot reform
The Commission has now given a living example of what the SPS reform change limitation, as defined by the Sipilja Government, means in practice.
The Vaala sote services are provided by the municipality of Oulunkaare, whose former regional manager, Attendo, was elected as head of health services in 2016.
The city council's leaders are warning the city council of a change restriction.
If the costs of the soce increase now, the municipal government will cut the subsidies in the future.
The city's centers were panicked, and most of them are ready for a major restructuring of the elderly care system that would end the bed-care and memory unit of the health center.
Home care would be increased, meaning that in long-distance Valah, the elderly living in remote areas would be treated at their roots as "home" next to the health centre.
Attendo trusted the city to pay its customers.
The Left did not swallow the poor preparation for the election, but instead organized a good public event, attended by many relatives, carers and also representatives of other parties.
I presented in the notes of the preparation of the sausage tasting how the municipality of Vaala is already the home of the elderly in the whole of Northern Bohemia.
Also with her was the local representative, Carina Westeninen.
A local newspaper made a big story out of the opportunity, and it took the Owl Mountain preparers to their heels.
War preparers do not write on any papers that Attendo has built a new nursing home in Vaala, which is now empty of residents.
There are no other service providers.
The manufacturers only talk about the service schedule but do not say what levels of care it will receive or what staff structure Attendo will have to take care of the elderly until they are taken into care.
Without a nurse?
The health centre is closed because there is no doctor's appointment.
Attendo will also have to go to the doctors at Vaala Health Centre.
The example of Vaal shows how central officials run the delegates with the most inadequate information and the delegates are pushed back against the wall with a change barrier.
The Centre Party will thus evacuate Vaal's inhabitants, for whoever remains there unprotected will live there voluntarily if they have the opportunity to move away.
Was there a single election in the center that would make the whole country populated?
Turkish President Erdogan opened a mosque in Cologne
In the German city of Cologne, thousands of people showed their appreciation when Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who was visiting the country, opened one of the largest mosques in Europe.
Several hundred people had gathered on the beach of Rhein in the morning.
Erdogan is not welcome, read the protest signs, and the slogans condemned fascism.
During Erdogan's visit to the country on Thursday, several demonstrations have been held and security measures have been tightened.
In Cologne, some 10,000 people were expected to take to the streets in advance to protest, among others, the human rights situation in Turkey.
The crowd of supporters of Erdogan had gathered near the Grand Mosque.
However, the police had isolated a large area from the surrounding mosque for security reasons.
In his opening speech, Erdogan praised the success of his visit to Germany and said that it had strengthened relations between Germany and Turkey.
During his visit, Erdogan met with Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel twice.
Erdogan and Merkel vowed on Friday to rebuild relations between countries that have deteriorated significantly since the 2016 Turkish coup attempt.
The Commission's proposal for a directive on the protection of workers from the risks of the use of the Internet in the context of the European Union's internal market was adopted on 1 January.
Appreciation Surrounded by Visitation
Both Cologne Mayor Henriette Reker and the Prime Minister of the state of North Rhine-Westphalia, Armin Laschet, cancelled their participation in the opening ceremony as criticism of Erdogan's visit intensified.
A 30-year-old student from Turkey, Cansu, said he came from Switzerland to protest against Erdogan.
I want to be a voice for those who can't take to the streets in Turkey.
They've been arrested, killed, and humiliated.
For Erdogan, anything that deviates from his own thinking is terrorism.
During the final phase of Erdogan's German journey, a significant part of the population of North Rhine-Westphalia is of Turkish origin.
Three charges of murder of a journalist in Slovakia
In Slovakia, three people have been charged with the murder of journalist Jan Kucic.
The prosecutor said Friday that three people are being charged with the February murder of Kucic and his fiancee and other crimes.
Earlier this week, police arrested eight people in the murder investigation, but five of them have been released.
Kuciak was found shot dead in February with his fiancée at his home in Bratislava.
He had been investigating the links between politicians and the Italian mafia.
Police suspect the murders are connected to Kucic's files.
The case and the article published by Kucic have raised concerns about media freedom and corruption in Slovakia.
There may be problems in the distribution of cattle on Sundays in the areas of the split zone.
Because of a printing error, Karjalainen will have to be mailed to the address unknown on Sunday.
This may be reflected in the distribution of the paper in the distribution areas where distribution to the common boxes is required to carry out external surveys.
The situation was the same for the Saturday paper, and the problem may continue on Monday.
The Post Office is putting extra newspaper clippings in the county.
The other Finnish subscribers' papers are only sent separately on Mondays in split form.
The distribution of these papers is being delayed significantly.
Vesa is a Finnish astronaut
The report by Mr Arto Nyberg will be broadcast live on his upcoming talk show, including Vesa Heilala.
Vesa is in the studio telling us about his upcoming space trip, which he booked from Virgin Galactic back in 2010.
The price was EUR 151 000 which was required to pay for the loan.
If the original plans had been true, Vesa would have gone into space a long time ago.
But the date of departure has been postponed by one year.
Now it seems that after a failed flight in 2014 that even cost us our lives, things are in order.
If all goes well, commercial flights will start this year or next year at the latest.
Vessa's flight number is 300, which means that her journey is about a year after her first departure.
The flight takes 2.5 hours and in a weightless state, you'll be at an altitude of 100 kilometers for 5 minutes, a Finnish astronaut says on his upcoming homepage.
At the same address, he also sets the tone for the longing for space.
When I was a kid, I read a comic book called Space Travel and I watched Star Trek on TV.
I mean, we've seen Star Wars, and that's why I thought...
Why not?
Everyone has their own dreams.
Manchester City was a boring host.
Manchester City continued their unbeaten run in the Premier League after a 2-0 defeat at home to Brighton on Saturday.
The sixth season of the reigning championship is guaranteed by the goalscorers Raheem Sterling and Sergio Agüero.
Sterling managed to steer his fourth shot of the season from near-zero to zero when Leroy Sané found him in the 30th minute on the back of Brighton's goal.
Agüero raised his own paintball to five when he and Sterling tore up Brighton's defense in the 65th minute.
The Argentine was able to place the 2-0 finishes on the penalty spot with ease.
With six wins and one draw, City are leading the Premier League with 19 points.
However, Liverpool, who have played one less game, are only one point away.
Liverpool will face Chelsea in their seventh round of the FA Cup on Saturday night.
The youth groups have elected new decision-makers in Joensuu
The Finnish Youth Council elected new decision-makers for the next three-year term 2019-2021.
The Chairman was appointed by Anu Sivonen of Upper Savona and the Vice-Chairman by Petra Mäkeläinen Häme.
The Council elected 40 full and 40 deputy members, the Finnish Youth Council said on Sunday.
The youth conference was held in Joseon.
We want our cultural hobby to be known for its quality and safety.
The Youth Council in June made three commitments in its three-year objectives: to keep the doors open to all, to organize equal leisure activities regardless of their place of residence and background, and to support volunteering and people in their own growth zones, the Finnish Youth Council said in its press release.
Lewis Hamilton praised Kimi Räikkönen and surprised Ferrari, saying, "Losing a very important driver".
In an interview with the Swiss newspaper Blick, the British brand Mersu was asked if he believed that releasing Kimi Räikkönen from Ferrari's services would help Hamilton in the end of the season.
Hamilton leads Ferrari's second driver Sebastian Vettel in the World Cup points with 40.
A little less than three weeks ago, Ferrari announced that Raikkonen would not be staying for the next season, and at the same time Raikkonen announced his move to Sauber.
Hamilton, of course, doesn't think the Rack would hit the gloves on the table.
I don't think Kimi's gonna change for the rest of the games.
He's an exceptional professional. He's a fantastic driver.
He's one of my favourite drivers and I'm convinced Ferrari is losing a very important driver.
I don't think that makes sense.
Hamilton has previously told me that the Rack has been one of his models.
I don't know if Kimi knows this, but when I was young and dreaming of Formula One, I played the F1 game on the PlayStation every day.
I was always Kim, which is pretty crazy, Hamilton said in June.
F1 season continues on Sunday with the Russian Grand Prix.
From the starting point at 2 p.m., the race is for Mercedes Valtteri Bottas.
The evening news is following the race from moment to moment.
The A-League Championship for youngsters has become a farce: only seven players have been able to enter the competition .
The boys' top flight of football ends on Saturday with the final round of the season.
Before the start of the round at 13:00 the starting points for the championship were clear: FC Lahti Academy had enough points in the first round against Vasa IFK.
To turn things around in the final round, the second-place Ilveks in the championship must win the PK-35 and hope for a loss for the Gulfers.
However, the championship of the Latvian team was virtually confirmed before the opening draw, as Vasa IFK had arrived in the Latvian Championship with only seven players.
If there were one fewer Vasalas, the match could not have been started.
FC Lahti Academy won the match 16-0.
At the break, the Bayers led 7-0.
One reason for the lack of players in the pool is that the team has played partly with the same players in the A-Team SM-League, the P20 Series, and the Men's Second Division C.
Left IFK has played in the second half virtually the whole season against the Fallen.
In the second round of the final on Saturday, Vasa IFK must win the JBK away match and hope that Tampere United will lose their own away match against KuFu in Siilin Lake Toiva.
The car ended up on the roof in Enos . According to the rescue service , it was a lucky ride .
A passenger car drove off the road and ended up on the roof of Enno's Juttu Danger on Sunday at around 9:00.
There were four people involved in the accident.
Two of them were slightly injured, rescue services say.
Luck was involved, the press release says.
The rescue team said the road was wet from the rain.
Police arrived at the scene.
The Commission is looking forward to new means of intelligence: equipment purchases and recruitment already done, no work planned abroad is being done
According to the head of the police, Antti Pelttari, the intelligence agency has been prepared by conducting equipment purchases and training personnel.
The Commission has already decided to extend the budget of the European Union to the following areas:
The Helsinki Railway Station (HSE) is already fully prepared for the entry into force of the intelligence laws.
The head of the assembly, Antti Pelttari, tells Western Media that the equipment has already been purchased for future intelligence agencies.
Serena Williams shocks with a video of her singing in the upper part of her body campaigning for breast cancer awareness
Tennis superstar Serena Williams is back on the grid.
Now she is campaigning to raise awareness about breast cancer by posting a video on her Instagram account in which she sings with her hands just in front of her breasts, reports AFP news agency.
It's a song from the 1991 hit I Touch Myself by Australian band The Divinyl.
Williams is making a video to support the Australian Breast Cancer Association.
"I played the worldwide hit The Divinyl to remind women to regularly do their own checkups", Williams writes in an Instagram post.
And yes, this put me in a discomfort zone, but I wanted to do it because the topic touches all women, regardless of skin color, all over the world.
Early detection is everything a and o... it's playing into many lives.
The second author of The Divinyl is Chrissy Amphlett, who died of breast cancer five years ago at the age of 53.
The music video is part of the I Touch Myself project, which is dedicated to Chrissy Amphlett.
"She died of breast cancer, but she gave us a hit song to remind women to put their health first", says Williams.
The video has been viewed 1.5 million times.
It was published early Sunday morning.
The video's comments praise Williams for his courage.
Williams dropped out of the Beijing tennis tournament earlier this week.
The background is a stunt at the US Open three weeks ago.
Williams fired at the match's referee, saying, among other things, that men are more tolerant of harsher behavior than women.
Chinese food on the mountain path is not for high-rise people.
In addition to traditional Chinese delicacies, the restaurant offers wonderful scenery.
In Zhejiang province, China, an exceptional restaurant has opened.
It's literally on the tongue of a rock.
From there, you can see the forest underneath if you want.
The countryside at high altitudes makes restaurant guests take their breath away in the Longquan Mountains.
To get to the restaurant, you have to walk around the peach trees.
The restaurant opened to pedestrians on September 19, 2018.
You're watching YouTube comments asking where the restaurant's bathroom is.
You know, walking into a restaurant requires a good basic knowledge, they say.
The rain of the corbel ends today.
All good things come to an end in time.
Today, this is what happens to a local country drama, the Korpela film festival, which has been held quite a bit.
The third season of the programme has been a hot one: last week, 722 000 Finns watched the first episode on television.
The highlights themselves have no practical significance anymore, as the series of Weak Creation and Jukka Mäkisen will not be a sequel.
In the final period, Jaska and Mirka's relationship is once again being refined, and I think Jaska's mother is the first to guess what's coming.
Anss and Misa are warm, romantic in light of recent events, but then again, the Light appears in the pictures.
The police are also in a suspicious position regarding the bearded man.
But no one can predict the fate of the Slayer.
Anita, on the other hand, gets some incredible news.
The last wish of the distance is revealed, which brings her to tears.
In a week, on Sunday nights, we'll be continuing with the new season of Soryon.
The cable show is on TV1 tonight at 9:05.
Should we go to work tomorrow with a little flu?
Here's the facts for and against.
The flu season is coming up.
A lot of the scars stay home or not.
However, it is worth considering whether it is better to infect others, since the disease can be contagious even if your symptoms are mild.
Sometimes the flu symptoms come on suddenly, sometimes they come on in a whisper.
In the latter case, you may already be infected, even if your symptoms seem minor, says the journal Prevention.
So, you think I should stay home?
Prevention suggests that the flu can be contagious even when the person has no symptoms.
The virus can be contagious for days before symptoms begin and from five days to a week.
Children may be more likely to get the disease.
Once you recognize the symptoms, you shouldn't be at school or work.
You can go back to work when your cough has calmed down and the fever is gone, says medical professor Gregory Poland.
You should also avoid training.
Going back to the gym too fast will slow the recovery.
Also, remember to wash your hands, rinse your nostrils, and throw crap papers in the trash.
- You're moving fast, though?
If you have to leave home sick, consider using a toilet seat.
The mask does not keep the virus in check, but it keeps the wearer aware of the area of the head.
"That's when you don't put your fingers in your nose or mouth", says Poland.
And the brain's also limited to the mask.
How, then, can we avoid infections?
The best way to do that is to wash your hands and avoid touching your face.
However, the latter is difficult to avoid.
For example, in the United States, the average person touches his eyes, nose, or mouth every 15 to 30 seconds, warns Poland.
New Miss Finland repeats the Missing: "My husband is an ice skater" tradition
The ice skater and the misses are often associated with each other.
That's what happened to Alina Voronkovova, 23.
The 2018 Miss Finland crown has been won by Alina Voronkova from Pertunma.
The beauty now lives in the Gulf, where she moved at the age of 15.
Alina's mother is of Inker-Funen and her father is Russian.
Because of his father's Russian her father was bullied at school.
My mother and father moved to Finland 25 years ago, but I was bullied because I was Russian.
I had no friends at all in the country, Alina says at the announcement of the semi-finalists of the Miss Finland pageant.
After high school, Alina decided to start at a clean table and move to Lahti to attend high school.
Soon the missionary made new friends and the ark began to roll hopefully.
At 15, he thinks he's an adult, but after all this time, I really wasn't.
Three years ago, Alina met her current partner, Joonas Hurrin, who is known for his work in the Pelican ranks.
After his career in the SM-liiga, the ice hockey player has played abroad, such as in Sweden and China.
In 2009, he was part of the Finnish team at the World Youth Under-18 Championship.
In the early days of the association, the couple lived apart for almost a year, but later Alina was able to travel the world with her husband.
If I could make it to the winning trio and that would ruin my career, I don't want to believe that it would affect our relationship in any way.
Even if we were to live apart, we would have trust working well, and the good thing about a long distance relationship is that it stays on as a starting point for the whole time, Alina said in May.
♪ Joyful of continual growth ♪ Death in our basements ♪
Almost everyone is concerned about the sustainability of the Earth.
Still, there's just nothing you want to give up.
Sustainable alternatives to continued growth are sought, but even the theory of the economy is facing major problems.
For several generations, the continuous growth of the economy has brought ordinary people, especially in the Northern Hemisphere, a standard of living that was once only a dream.
However, the long-term excess of the earth's capacity and climate change are threatening to weaken this cornerstone of the market economy.
Two men were stabbed the night before Sunday at the Cinderella Citrator at 4:00 a.m.
A man born in 1986 was seriously wounded by a stab wound and a second, born in 1968, was slightly wounded.
The older of the men has already left the hospital.
Police have arrested one person who is being investigated for his possible role in the stabbing.
Police are also looking for another suspect in connection with the incident.
The incidents are being investigated as attempted murder and gross assault.
A big point for IFK Mariehamn . Inter coach has made a mistake .
IFK Marieham's Simon Silverholt's draw against Inter brought a crucial point to the team in the men's football league on Saturday.
Silverholt finished the match 1-1 in the 78th minute.
Silvelholt crossed the right flank and, fortunately, carried the ball over goalkeeper Henrik Moisander.
In the match against the hosts, the Maarianhams extended the gap to two points at the Turku Ballosphere.
A key goal and a valuable point, said Peter Lundberg, head coach of Marianahamna.
Lundberg said, however, that the team did not engage in the fight he expected.
We made a lot of mistakes in the opening period, but luckily, the Turkules' shot put us in a stronger position.
Inter's head coach John Allen said the game was under control, but the painting was again painful.
One defensive error took us all the points, Allen said.
We were the best again!
Finland has the highest human value in the world
Finland has been ranked number one in the comparison of 195 countries.
The study measured the health and education of the population.
Finland is the best country in the world, if you measure it by human capital.
Finland was ranked first in a survey measuring the health, education and learning of citizens.
The Commission also examined whether the measures were compatible with the internal market.
The study was published in The Lancet.
In summary, human capital has a significant impact on how the national economy can grow in the future.
The most serious situation is in Africa.
The mainland countries took the seven worst places in comparison.
Niger is behind us.
STT was the first to tell us about it.
The player showed his under-powered skills. The location is still uncertain.
Jori Lehter's strong under-playing skills came to light when his NHL team, the Philadelphia Flyers, played their final practice game before the season began.
Philadelphia beat Boston 4-1, and Lehter fed Michael Raffle to the painting twice.
The last few days, Lehter has been on the run for drug suspects.
MTV said Wednesday that Lehter is one of 23 suspects in drug cartels involved in suspected drug use and sales.
The doctor has denied any involvement in the crime.
The club and the player have been discussing the matter, and the NHL is investigating the case.
Following the game, Sam Carchidi, a reporter for the Philadelphia Inquirer, told the Flyers that Lehter was one of six attackers, five of whom would make the NHL team.
In practice, Lechter was excellent, according to Carchid.
In the second round, Lehter fought the scout himself with subpoena, pulled the defender into his attack and hit the goal in front of the waiting opening of the Raffle.
The second time, the two teams worked together, and they scored a goal right after the game.
The Flyers are opening the NHL season on October 4th with a homecoming game against Las Vegas.
In Boston, defensive end Urho Vaakanainen is waiting for the team's coaching staff to decide if he's eligible for the NHL draft.
I thought the training camp was good.
I did my best, and I can be proud of that.
Now the coaches decide if I can play.
I believe I'm ready for the NHL, Vaakanainen said in an interview posted on Boston's Twitter account.
The boy who learned to play hockey was Vaakanaine, who played Philadelphia for 7:31.
In Boston, Tuukka Rask surrendered four times and turned down 20 times.
The bat-back, Vili Saarijärvi, scored a 1-0 lead against Detroit as the team beat Toronto 5-1.
In the Calgary lineup, Ilvesse was raised, the defensive midfielder Juuso was given the starting point, but Edmonton defeated Calgary 4-3.
The Oilers included Jesse Lake, and goalkeeper Mike Kosk.
Floridan Aleksander Barkov played the full 20 minutes and scored a goal in a local game against Tampa Bay.
Tampa won 3-2.
Columbus defender Markus Nutivaara was feeding his team a consolation painting in the middle of the final when Chicago defeated Columbus 4-1.
With the loss, Joonas Corpi House turned down the 23/27 lead.
Already fair 180,000 answers to the clock question
Citizens have actively responded to a survey on the decision on Finland's future.
The question of whether Finland should continue to apply winter or summer time has already attracted a fair number of 180,000 responses.
The survey opened on the service Takakanta.fi will be answered in just a few weeks.
Respondents were also asked to comment on whether Finland should be at the same time as other Nordic countries, the Baltic States, Central Europe or Western Russia.
A recent image shows a change: The world's strongest man has lost tens of pounds
In 2017, Eddie Hall, crowned the world's strongest man, is going through a dramatic transformation.
The British man Eddie Hall has been chasing the title of the strongest man in the world for a long time and determinedly.
Hall could eat up to 10,000 pounds of food a day and weighed as much as 200 pounds, according to Mirror magazine.
The shirts were 5XL.
Before winning the title, Hall admitted to causing bodily harm.
The human body wasn't designed to be this big, Hall said.
The British chased the world's strongest man win by any means necessary and the family man promised to end his career if he got the title.
Hall didn't want his kids to grow up without a father.
Hall kept his promise and was never seen again at the 2018 World's Strongest Man Games in April.
Hall recently posted a photo on Instagram posing a significantly active woman in a more decent condition.
Hall writes his current weight is 169.5 kg.
Hall wrote that he now practices aerobic five times a week.
Some of the activities included boxing, cycling, and swimming.
And Hall does four workouts a week at the gym.
This year, the world's strongest man was Hafþór Júlíus Björnsson, an Icelandic who is also known for his role in the TV series Game of Thrones.
The previous Finnish winner of the race is Janne Virtanen, who was first in 2000.
The food ship M/S Tampere crashed into a cattle on the Pyhäjärvi - "Strengthened on a rock"
The inland waterway M/S Tampere was launched late Friday evening on Lake Aqaba.
The rescue team received an alert for a water transport accident Friday night after 12:30 p.m.
The 30-metre M/S Tampere has been hit by a carriage and is firmly attached to a rock on its bow, described by fire chief Matti Willman.
There were 19 passengers and five crew members on board.
According to the rescue service, no personal injury was reported.
The passengers and almost all crew members have been evacuated to the mainland.
Now they're being transported by bus to Tampa, a friend of the day, Chief Jari Nieminen, told STT after 1:00 p.m.
Ambulance services were alerted to the port of Viiala to pick up evacuated passengers.
For some reason, the ship sailing from Hämeenstadt to Tampere had drifted off course on the western side of the narrow Jumusensalmen.
The police are trying to figure out what's going on.
Firefighter Matti Willman, a friend of mine, told me earlier tonight that the conditions on the lake are difficult because of the darkness and the rather strong winds.
The rescue agency says the fate of the ship is unclear.
It's not like the ship's leaking.
After the evacuation, the divers will begin to check the situation at the bottom.
The M/S Tampere, built in 1957, is now an inland waterway vessel operating as a restaurant ship with a maximum authorised passenger capacity of 180.
The ship also has a private meeting room for hire.
According to the ship's website, the cruiser was previously operated in 2001, 2014 and 2017.

Former managers demanding unpaid salaries from Robert Helenius
The night of the boxer Robert Helenius' fight against the Hard Tapes is a shadow of a dollar bill.
Tonight, Sanomat announced the challenge filed by boxing manager Jaakko Helmen and deputy judge Jussi Kokkilan, which requires Helenius to pay out unpaid management fees totalling more than €80,000 with delay rates.
According to the challenge application, Helminen and Kokkila worked for Helenius from 15.4.2014 to 30.1.2015.
We've tried to make peace, but there's no other choice.
"We have had a clear mission here, and a very, very good work has been done", Cook told Ilta-Sanom.
Markus Sundman, the current manager of Heleneus, sent a reply to the Evening Post, which described the events from the point of view of the boxer.
Helenius denies that he is obliged to pay the amount required.
According to his replies, Kokkila and Helminen had offered their services to Helenius in a financially difficult situation and promised to be able to organise matches and sponsorship events for him.
It was agreed that Helenius was only obliged to pay the fees for a percentage of his matches.
It was repeatedly assured that Helenius would have nothing to pay, only to receive the income they arranged.
This is also the normal and only practice in the management of professional athletes.
The wage agreement has never been reached and would have been unreasonable in the case of Heleneus, Sundman explains in his message.
The cooperation was never written.
According to the respondent, Helenius had initially wanted to agree on the revenue stream in writing, but Kokkila and Sundman did not get the draft draft completed until the end of 2014.
He said the proposal was unfavorable and cut off his cooperation with Cook and Helms.
Helenius never took a single step when he was dealing with Cook and Helms.
A year after the end of the cooperation, Helenius was shown an "indifferent but considerable" decline in the manager's work.
This year, the same charges have been filed.
Helenius considers the post-war activities of Helmen and Kokkila to be the worst, he said.
Today, Helenius will face the IBF heavyweight champion Erka Teper in Stuttgart.
A hearty man and a good reporter
Entertainment artist and music producer Ilkka "Ile" Vainio knew the late radio host and journalist Erkki Päll for decades.
Long-time radio host and journalist Erkki Pälli died at the age of 83 from incurable liver cancer.
The death of the plotter was announced on Sunday in the Helsinki Gazette.
The notice says Pall died on September 3.
Pälli reported a serious illness on his Facebook page in March 2018.
The publication was also seen at the time by Ile Vainio, who was saddened to learn of the fate of a familiar.
He left Facebook earlier, like goodbye, says Ile Vainio.
The man who killed Erkki Pälli is a multi-talented expert who became a brilliant reporter.
He remembers Pallin being a man who was considered a man with fast pitches and funny stuff.
I got to know Erkin as a little boy when I first went to Finnlev at the age of 12 and started there as a warehouse manager.
That's when Erkin and I met.
He was a reporter at Finnlevy at the time, and he was in various roles, Ile Vainio recalls.
As I started making records as a music producer, there were hundreds of occasions where Erkki Pälli was a regular at every party doing artists' stuff.
He was always a professional, and I saw how much fire he had for entertainment, music, and people.
When Erkki interviewed someone, he got directly into the skin of the people he interviewed.
He was a hearty man and a good reporter.
He became known to many as a respected Yle radio host, but he also wrote great magazine articles.
Erkki interviewed me a few times.
He was a good speaker.
For decades, Pälli worked for Fazer Records, in addition to being a journalist, with Toivo Kärje.
He was a music producer for Vesa-Matti Loir.
But Pall's greatest passion was radio work, which he had a unique style.
He worked in radio from the 1960s onwards, and became known to many listeners on the Yle ether.
The Pill retired in 1998.
The Finnish Ski Association announced on Saturday that the association's profit for the financial year ending in May was approximately EUR 450 000.
The Union describes its economic situation as having undergone a "full transformation", although the economy is indeed burdened by "the considerable debt in the balance".
Chief Executive Mika Kulmala has praised the quick response and the strict financial discipline.
We have been responding to the situation since last autumn, taking measures to adapt as quickly as possible.
The careful planning and financial management of the operation has been a hit throughout our organisation, Kulmala said in a statement.
We have also been very successful in partnering and, in addition, the profits of the world champions were at their highest level last season.
However, we must also manage costs carefully in the future, while continuing to look for new funding models.
I heard my wife screaming for help, but then there was silence.
Dozens of bodies lie in the backyard of a hospital in Palun, Indonesia's Sulawes Island.
Only one building separates them from the area where the injured survivors are assembled to assess the need for injury and treatment.
Patients are also being treated outside for post-concussion events.
One of the people who was moving around the hospital area was a 52-year-old male Baharuddin, who was looking for his son.
Like many Indonesians, he uses only one name.
I have one child, and she's missing.
The last time I spoke to him was when he was going to school, Baharuddin told AFP.
In the courtyard of the Palusa Army Hospital, Dwi Haris was lying, with injuries to her back and arms.
He was at a local hotel when the quake started with his wife and daughter.
The family was invited to the Palu wedding.
I probably got crushed under the collapsed wall.
I heard my wife screaming for help, but then there was silence.
I don't know what happened to her and my baby.
I hope they're safe, Haris told the AP news agency, according to British media.
Small shops are being robbed
At the Pagi evacuation center, the mother of a 35-year-old baby, Risa Kusuma, tried to calm her fever-free baby.
He described the atmosphere in the city as tense.
There's not much clean water.
"Small shops are looted everywhere", Kusuma told me.
Many of the people living in the province have slept outside or in temporary bars.
Even if the house were somehow standing, possible aftershocks could destroy it permanently and bury the residents alone.
According to the AP, more than half of the prisoners in Palun escaped after the prison walls collapsed.
There were reportedly about 560 prisoners, so there may be about 300 fugitives.
Some of the prisoners in Donggala prison have also escaped, reports The Jakarta Post.
The newspaper reported that the prisoners became furious and set the prison on fire after guards forbade them to go looking for relatives who had been affected by the earthquake and tsunami.
The airport in Piau has reopened mainly for emergency flights.
Among the first to land was an Army C-130 transport aircraft carrying relief supplies.
Commercial flights to please airport are only permitted on a limited basis.
The pilots have to land at the airport without the help of the flight controller, as the flight control tower was badly damaged in the earthquake.
The rain is sweeping over Finland at night
On the night before Sunday, a long, westerly rain area will cover the entire country, reports the Meteorological Institute.
Most of the rain comes from water, but in the Central and Northern Hemispheres, it is expected to melt or snow.
The last night's cold temperatures are not repeated because temperatures remain higher under the cloud cover.
A cloudier night keeps the lowest temperatures in the air pretty well.
"The west side of the island is a temporary place to visit", said weatherman Ville Ilkka.
On Sunday, the rain area will shift eastward during the day.
There's a little bit of a rainbow in the south and west.
In the afternoon, temperatures always move to the height of Oulu, at 10-13 degrees.
The first week of the week looks similar in terms of temperatures in the southern and central parts of the country, but the weather is becoming more volatile.
The Merian has wind and wave warnings in effect.
Actual autumn storms are not expected in the coming days, but otherwise, typical autumn weather varies.
"The autumn is about to start, really", said Ilka.
Miss Finland final not on TV
You can watch the glamour and the lightning on the red carpet of the Miss Finland pageant on IL-TV.
Tonight's entertainment news is being broadcast live on IL-TV from the red carpet of the Miss Finland final at Billnass's rostrum.
The transmission starts around 6:50 p.m.
The new Miss Finland will be crowned on Saturday among the ten finalists.
The Miss Finland 2018 final will be held at Raasepor in Billnass.
Before the finals start, you'll be able to watch the atmosphere live on IL-TV.
The live broadcast will start at approximately 6:30 p.m. and will continue for approximately one hour.
This year, there have been a number of special invitations to the final of Miss Finland.
In the jury they are represented by Miss Finland 1998 Jonna Cyprus.
The other judges are the welfare entrepreneur Jutta Gustafsberg, photographer Nadi Hammouda, the CEO of the Jun Trade Minttu Murphy-Kaulanen and the news producer Katja Lintunen of the Six.
We were hoping he could get to college before he went to the Miss Universe.
The Russian father of Dmitri and the English mother of Svetlana believed in their daughter's success in the Miss Finland final.
The parents of the new Miss Finland Alina Voronkov, Dimitri Voronkov and Svetlana Voronkov, were proud to follow their daughter's first moments in the crown.
They were going to the audience from Pertunland and they were going to drive home after the final.
It's a lovely atmosphere!
We believed Erika the whole time, but half an hour before she came, she was getting really nervous.
Svetlana is English and Dmitri is Russian.
Alina speaks fluent Russian, even though she has lived all her childhood in Finland.
Svetlana says that when she was younger, Alina was more interested in acting and many other things than any career.
Alina was often told that when she's so pretty, she should start missing out.
But he said he wanted to be a radio host.
It wasn't until later that Alina became enthusiastic about beauty pageants.
Her parents wanted her to get into college before she could compete in the Miss Finland pageant.
So it was, and finally, Alina wanted to get her degree before the Miss Universe.
We asked him last year why he wasn't going, but he wanted to finish the case.
Her parents believe that Alina won the competition because she sets a healthy example for young people and adults alike.
He exercises a lot and eats healthy.
And Alina likes to be on the show, you can tell.
Alina's boyfriend, Joonas Hurri, is working in Japan and has not been able to encourage his lover in the final.
Alina's parents believe that a relationship between two young people lasts for a year.
That's the point!
Her parents hoped she would have time to visit soon.
It's been so long since we've had a visitation because of the missus mice.
I'm sorry, but I've already posted messages.
A young man died in Lahore in the middle of a traffic accident. Police arrested three people.
Police say three people have been arrested in connection with the incident.
The police, as a matter of shame, did not comment on the course of events on Saturday, nor on any possible intentional appeal to the unfinished investigation.
Police also declined to comment on whether the arrested persons and the man who died over the course of the incident had ever met.
More information on the case will be available at the earliest beginning next week.
Sari Piippo left her career in Brussels and became a stay-at-home mom in Finland .
The creative boost came from my husband's statement that he proposed the person I was developing into a story, says Sari Piippo, an Espoo comic book blogger, housewife and former EU translator.
Sari Piippo says that she was in Brussels as an EU translator in economic and judicial matters until, after the fourth child, she became a returning mother ten years ago.
I've enjoyed being a housewife.
This has been the best time of my life, but at some point I thought, what would you do when you're older, when the youngest child is already getting older?
Then in 2014, I got a comic book.
Piippo says he never dreamed of doing a comic book, even though he had read Aku Ankka, Tintin and Asterix since he was a child.
I had last painted as a child, but when these Manuscripts of the Creator began to be produced, things changed.
I started out by putting a dozen or so scripts in a desk drawer.
My daughter Viivi Valkama (born 2000) is an accomplished painter, but I didn't get her to join me until the summer of 2016, when I donated Viivi using a drawing board.
His enthusiasm lasted for a dozen strips, and then he had to start trying himself, laughing at Pippo, who tells him that the drawing board was a great encouragement to him.
A drawing board is an easy and convenient tool to try and get something done.
I didn't even try to draw on paper, Piippo says of his relationship with drawing, which he usually does at night.
I'm always thinking of manuscripts, but I don't usually do them all at once.
It takes several hours to get a three-screen strip.
I can do the screen one at a time, and I like to play with the colors.
Starting drawing is always the hardest thing, because drawing is not my strongest kind.
Sari Piippo says she appreciates the recent newspaper series, including Scott Adams' Dilbert.
The creator-in-chief is a mother in a carrot cemetery who has a salad dress.
The other characters are Man, Piss and Twins.
In a creative world, a man is what he eats.
The ideas for the series come from your own life and social media.
The Chief of the Pippo doesn't want to preach or offer a bowl of beer, even if the Creator intrudes on us sometimes.
Pippo says she's reading the series with her husband and children.
I mean, it's just so great to look at the cartoon you're drawing and realize that's what I did today.
And enough challenges for a housewife!
The series can be read online at the following address:
Lotto 's million dollar bill was blown up . These were the real numbers .
The total number of participants in the lot was not found in round 39/2018.
The biggest win of the night was Saturday Joker, which brought €20,000 to Vantala and Vaasa.
Next week, the lottery's got 3.6 million euros.
Saturday Joker found two six-correct results.
The second prize of EUR 20 000 goes to Vantala S-Market Tikkurila for the winner who plays with a deck of playing cards.
The other was taken by a rogue online player.
Indonesian earthquake: Flight manager sacrificed himself not leaving the breaking tower until he got hundreds of passengers safely
The hero of the Indonesian earthquake has been the 21-year-old pilot, Anthonius Gunawan Agung.
Agung was left alone in the control tower until he managed to get a passenger plane carrying hundreds of people safely off the earthquake-torn island.
The young man was on duty at Mutiara SIS Al-Jufrie Airport in Palun City when the earthquake struck on Friday.
While fleeing the other air traffic controllers, Agung refused to leave his seat until he was able to steer the Batik Air passenger plane from the runway.
He was able to save hundreds of lives, the Indonesian Air Force told AFP.
Mutiara SIS from Al-Jufri airport after the earthquake on Saturday.
The flight control tower was waving and cracking.
Finally, Agung tried to escape by jumping from the fourth floor of the tower.
His leg broke and he got serious internal injuries.
Agung was taken to a nearby hospital.
He was to be flown by helicopter to a better equipped facility, but he died 20 minutes before the helicopter arrived, an air traffic control spokesman told The Jakarta Post.
The tremor continued to increase after the flight took off, and its magnitude was eventually measured at 7.5.
At least 832 people lost their lives.
The Indonesian Air Force has paid tribute to Agung's heroism on social media.
Rehn reflected on the end of the European trade war at the YEL: "You should look at the next tweet"
The trade war between the United States and China is reflected in the entire global economy.
Growth forecasts have been made throughout Europe and the Bank of Finland has also slightly lowered its own economic growth forecasts.
CEO Olli Rehn said in Yle's first speech that while the escalating tensions will not have a direct impact on European trade flows, they will weaken confidence, which in turn will be reflected in investment decisions made by companies.
The situation also applies to exports of Finnish companies.
The Commission has already decided to take a decision on the proposal for a directive.
It has been able to build an interim relationship with the United States and has helped to calm the situation with China and Japan.
The European Union does not seem to be falling into the hands of the trade war.
I need to look at the next tweet and then evaluate it.
We have a rather unpredictable partner heading to Washington, however, he said in an interview with Yle.
Europe also has its own risks.
One of them is Italy, the euro area's third largest economy, which is also one of the most indebted countries in the euro area and the entire Western world.
The market reacted strongly yesterday evening to the Italian government's clear statement on the budget deficit.
Next year's deficit is more than 2.4 percent of GDP.
Rehn is concerned about the situation in Italy.
The country's borrowing is 5% problem loans and over 10% non-coordinated loans.
In addition, its public economy is in a weak position and the country appears to be once again exceeding its commitment to its European partners.
Perhaps we should not paint new crises yet, Rehn replied when asked whether Italy would lead Europe into a new economic crisis.
The second challenge for Europe is Britain's departure from the EU.
Rehn hoped it would work out.
A contentious divorce would have far more negative effects.
Rehn started as CEO of the Bank of Finland in July.
The President of the European Central Bank (ECB) Mario Draghi will step down after a fair year.
The conversation with his successor has begun.
Both Rehn and his predecessor Erkki Liikasen have been disgraced in the speeches.
I'm sure it won't matter if Finnish names are involved, Rehn said, adding that he's not going to comment on this any further.
HS's highly recommended Black Box show will resume next week. Last tickets to Helsinki are on sale.
The popular Black Box shows, organised by Saningomin, will resume next week.
The rest of the shows will be shown at the National Theatre on October 2, 8 and 11.
On 23 October, the Black Box visits the Tampere Theatre for the first time.
There's still a few tickets to the National Theatre on sale.
The Tampere show is sold out.
Tickets are sold by Lippu.fi.
During the evening, the journalists and photographers on stage tell of their long preparation of a true story that has not been published in any HS tool.
There's something else in it that no one's ever heard of.
"There's a strange spy on the night in Helsinki, an impressive report from the other side of the world, and a telling story about a very current health issue", says Esa Lilja, one of the producers of Black Box.
After the presentation, the public will have the opportunity to meet the HS's reporters and photographers and continue the discussion.
The Helsinki Gazette has been organising live journalism nights for three years.
They've been popular from the beginning and often sold out.
We've seen more than 15,000 people.
The Black Box was awarded the Bonnier Gala for journalistic achievement of the year.
The awardees praised the new way of doing journalism and the desire of journalists to be closer to their readers.
The 2019 Spring Black Box will be seen at the National Theatre in March-April.
The exhibition will also be held in Tampere and in the market.
The presentation will be different from the one we have seen this evening.
The missing fungus was found through "an unprecedented experiment".
Finnish police drone expertise is world-class: "We are asked for training"
According to the head of the police academy, the police can use drones to search for missing persons, for example, for crime scene investigation and intelligence.
Oulu police managed to find a missing fungicide in Rahe in a few minutes with a drone.
Kimmo Himberg, principal of the Police Vocational High School, tweeted about the case, noting that "with unprecedented experimentation and effective education, we are also the world's best".
Drone is a fairly new chapter, and even newer in police work.
There is no statistic anywhere that the Finnish police would be a master drone operator.
According to Himberg, there is a strong sense that this is the case.
This has been shown, for example, by reports of Finnish police experience in international events.
"There's a tremendous amount of interest in that elsewhere", says Himberg.
It would be a shame to have visitors to watch the Finnish police drone operation.
We're being asked for training.
It's getting worse.
In Finland, in winter conditions, it is very important to find the missing as soon as possible.
As noted, in Rahe's case, the missing person was found by drone in just a few minutes.
The Finnish police have trained hundreds of drone pilots already.
According to Himberg, they're supposed to be trained.
Drones are already widely used in police work, and they will become more common and more common in the future.
I'd dare to say that, says Himberg.
In addition to searching for missing persons, the police may use drones, for example, for accident or crime scene investigation and for certain types of intelligence.
For example, we already have to go to a more remote area where there is a potential fear of violence.
The drone can then be used for home pre-examination.
Cattle Rugby is in first place.
The Cowboys Rugby team celebrated their 2nd division win in Copenhagen on Saturday.
The Renovals were still in the middle of a 7-12 loss to Helsinki Rugby Club, but found a plot in the second half and whispered to the guests from the south 26-12.
The 2nd Division championship also marked Karjalan Rugby's historic promotion to Division 1.
The club has previously played in the top flight, but at the time the Finnish rugby league was divided into two levels, the SM-League and the multi-level 1.
The club is going to take over the strip, but it's gonna have a lot of work to do next winter.
The current roster of fewer than 20 players must be increased to 25.
Division 1 also knows the growth in the number of games and longer game trips, so the funding must also be consistent.
Eagle's Nest is starting the season in Montreal, confirmed by head coach
Claude Julien, head coach of the Montreal Canadiens, confirmed on Twitter that Finnish striker Jesperi Kotkaniemi will start the season in Montreal.
Montreal booked a super vacation with the 18th-year-old Eagles, first round pick, at the three-summer reserve event.
The attacker joined Montreal's practice squad at the end of the summer and has made strong strides in September's practice matches.
The eagle's best shot came in his first practice game.
The head coach, Julien, praised the Finnish's progress after arriving at the arrival camp.
The NHL's rowing series starts next week on the night of Thursday, Finnish time.
Montreal is going to face the Toronto Maple Leafs in the opening round.
What's a good leader like?
This week in Finland, there has been a lot of talk about leadership.
In an interview with HS, Nokia's chairman of the board, Risto Siilasmaa, told the magazine in his book Paranoid Optimist, in which he sheds light on his leadership philosophy.
At the same time, he is critical of the leadership of his predecessor, Jorma Ollilah.
Ollila strongly denied the allegations, but previous Nokia reports have also spoken of the inability of managers to work as a team; fear and inefficiency, which in part caused the collapse of the mobile phone business.
The company's rising-rate risk-taking and resilience were all gone.
The Nordic Business Forum was also held in Helsinki this week, attracting the attention of Finnish business leaders to the Messukentrum.
In addition to the star of the show, Barack Obama, 12 other business stars took the stage.
I've had enough of the good leadership talk.
The legendary Gary Hamel of management said that a good leader must have the courage to lead a company into the future even when it's doing well.
The problem is that decisions are made by those who are most emotionally bound to past decisions.
John Mackey, founder of Whole Foods, a chain of retail stores known for its extensive product line, said that a manager should know the message to all staff about the company's purpose.
And that can't be just to make a profit for the owners.
Susan Cain, author of a book about successful introverts, said that the most successful leaders are, in fact, humble.
They operate calmly, quietly and decisively.
They're often introverts.
Aswath Damodaran, a professor of finance, reminded us that the qualities of a good manager must coincide with the life cycle of a company.
In the early stages of a company, the manager must be able to tell the story on which the future of the company is based.
A company that's grown up needs a manager who knows the numbers.
These lectures were attended by 7,500 visitors at the Nordic Business Forum, mainly Finnish leaders.
The danger was that they had a clue.
A good leader is a great leader.
That's why leadership often goes wrong, even at the highest levels.
There were also Silasma and Olli.
They were talking to each other in the backdrop as companions.
But they hardly thought they were the right leaders for Nokia at the right time.
And their humility was not easy to judge on the outside.
Sara Chafak arrived on the gorgeous red carpet straight from Los Angeles to spend most of her year abroad.
Model Sara Chafak made it to the Miss Universe finals in a gorgeous black dress.
The 2012 Miss Finland dress also featured a crispy scarf.
I'm a little bit of a jet lag.
I'm back from L.A.
I spend most of my time there for a long time, Chafak tells me where he belongs.
Chafak says he's going to Los Angeles for a test drive.
He's done some commercials, among other things.
He describes his work in the United States as interesting, and also similar to that in Finland.
But he says that the work must be done harder, because a replacement is always easy to find.
You have to push harder and be aggressive, Chafak says.
Choreography for Sonya Lindfors with a €30,000 live art prize in Copia
Artist Sonya Lindfors won the €30,000 cultural prize in Copenhagen on Saturday.
Lindfors, winner of the Anti Festival International Prize for Live Art, works in choreography, community activism and teaching.
Sonya Lindfors's art is vital to her surroundings.
Her work gives others the opportunity to work and create spaces for dialogue in environments they have previously been denied access to, the winner was described.
In addition to the Finnish Lindfors, a number of international artists were nominated for the prize.
The prize is awarded annually to an exceptionally strong artist or group working in the field of live art.
Danish police found the Volvo they were looking for in the big operation: "We can't tell you where"
The Danish police's extensive search has yielded results.
At the beginning of the operation, traffic was closed on the bridges of the Jutland and the Ison Belt.
All your land and ferry services from the island of Sjælland to Sweden, Germany and other parts of Denmark were closed.
Police are looking for a registered black Volvo V90 in Sweden.
The IS has reached the deputy head of the Copenhagen police media centre.
The car we're looking for has been found.
We can't tell you where the car was found yet, Henrik Storm told Ilta-Sanom from a Copenhagen police briefing.
According to Storm, the black Volvo wanted is not directly related to the threat.
He says the greatest danger is over.
The Danish Ekstra Bladet told police about the press conference Saturday.
Detective Jørgen Bergen Skov was on the operation of the Silence.
He didn't want to tell me what kind of crime was being investigated.
However, Skov said it was a "serious crime".
It was a threat to human life.
We've been looking for three people in the operation.
The police won't say if they've been caught.
According to the paper, the restrictions on ferry traffic have been lifted.
Copenhagen police also followed the incident on their Twitter account.
However, according to the STT, the police say that the large public is no longer concerned because the threat was directed at certain people.
The name of Macedonia has caused decades of discord . Now the people are voting on it in a controversial election .
In the Balkans, Macedonia, a proposal for a new name is currently under vote.
Under the agreement between the governments of Macedonia and Greece, the name would be the Republic of North Macedonia.
Greece has so far blocked Macedonia's bid to join NATO and the EU by veto.
According to Greece, the name Macedonia belongs to its northern province.
The referendum question does not mention the new name but asks whether the voter supports Macedonia's EU and NATO membership by accepting the agreement.
At least the vote began online at a school in the centre of the capital, Skopje.
The school's retired nurse, Olivera Argirosvka, voted to support the agreement.
A referendum is a change if it opens the door to Europe and NATO.
It means change, especially for young people, he said.
The name of the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia has been used in official relations since the independence of Macedonia in 1991.
Prime Minister Zoran Zaev's government has campaigned for the agreement.
The right-wing opposition, including President Gjorge Ivanov, has again called for a boycott of the referendum.
In addition to the results, it is enough to worry about whether the turnout exceeds the required 50%.
The referendum is not binding, but a yes-no vote would give the mandate to amend the Constitution.
A two-thirds majority of the Parliament is needed to amend the Constitution.
The Greek Parliament must also approve the agreement.
Polling stations close at 8 pm Finnish time.
What a victory!
Robert Helenius has imprisoned Erka Teper
Robert Helenius met Erka Teper late Saturday night at a heavyweight boxing match in Germany.
The 34-year-old Finn took a 36-year-old German opponent's measurement at Waldenbuch in Stuttgart.
The final match of the evening was the Intercontinental Intercontinental series of the IBF League heavyweight division.
The winner of the competition will be given the opportunity to take on more difficult tasks of considerable economic importance on Saturday.
Helenius settled the game in the eighth inning, striking Teper with his hard left hand.
Teper couldn't get off the floor anymore.
Nordic Nightmare hit his opponent in the third round, and the German's nose started bleeding.
Helenius and Teper met in the ring for the first time.
They were supposed to take it in December 2015.
That's when Teper took a stand on injury and withdrew from the game.
It turned out that the German had failed two doping tests.
Helenius has won 28 professional games and lost two.
Teper, who has emerged as the game's clear favourite, has won 19 professional games and lost three times in his career.
Hamilton 's order to win , the Vettel 's already 50 points behind .
The Formula One championship was once again close to being confirmed, as Mercedes Lewis Hamilton won the Russian GP and narrowed his Ferrari world points lead to Sebastian Vettel by 50 points (306-256).
There's five games left.
Valtteri Bottas, who left the starting point, took second.
Last year, Bottas, who won the first race of his career at Sots, held the lead in the race, but Mercedes told Bottas to let Hamilton pass.
The race was third, the Ferrari's Kimi Raikkonen fourth.
Max Verstappen, the last starting pitcher, was fifth.
Two men assaulted a Jewish man in the city of Joensou , and they were caught outside the block .
Two men assaulted and beat and kicked a 31-year-old juvenile in the Joensuu area of Siltakatu 12 just after 6:00 p.m. on Saturday.
Police say the men also intercepted the victim's phone, among other things.
Police reached the suspects, a 35-year-old man with a gunshot wound and a 39-year-old man from the Pleasant Mansion, near the block shortly after the incident.
They were arrested on suspicion of robbery, police said.
The victim suffered bone fractures that did not require a doctor's visit.
Tesla CEO Elon Musk is stepping down as chairman of the board.
Musk has reached a settlement with the U.S. authorities.
At the same time, Musk has been fined $20 million for his alleged claims that he secured funding to pull Tesla out of the stock market.
The SEC has charged Musk with securities fraud.
Musk will remain the CEO of Tesla, but the company will also have to pay a fine of EUR 20 million if the agreement between the authorities and Musk is upheld in court.
Canada is fighting against time to reach a deal with the United States on oil.
Time is running out in the middle of negotiations between the United States and Canada on the Free Trade Agreement with Oil.
The United States has set a deadline for Sunday, and negotiators have had close discussions over the weekend.
Canada's chief negotiator, Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland, postponed his speech at the UN General Assembly to focus on full trade negotiations.
At the request of President Donald Trump, the United States, Canada and Mexico began negotiations about a year ago to renew the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA).
At the end of August, Mexico and the United States reached an agreement, but the agreement with Canada has not yet been reached.
The United States and Mexico want to bring the agreement into force before Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, the Mexican presidential winner, takes office in early December.
Trump has said that Canada's involvement in the deal is not necessary.
He's previously told Congress he plans to sign the treaty by the end of November, whether Canada is involved or not.
In view of these timetables, the text of the agreement between the United States and Canada should be ready by Sunday in order to allow the United States Congress sufficient time to assess it.
A neighbor thought the candlelight was a fire in Kaakkur . The fire alarm was sounded .
The candles burning in a high-rise apartment in Kaakkur, Oulu, caused a fire alarm on the night before Sunday.
Dozens of rescue units were alerted to the scene of a possible fire in the basement.
The fire was discovered at the scene and the candles burning in the sauna of the apartment building had looked like a fire in the opposite direction, so the emergency department was notified.
There was no fire on the target.
Police arrested 11 people after the Honka-HJK match.
Police arrested 11 people on Saturday in Espoo after the men's football league Honka-HJK match, Western New Zealand Police Department Crime Commissioner Teemu Värtinen confirmed to STT.
The reason for the arrest was to protect against crime and interference.
The Chinese were released after the situation had calmed down, Värtinen said.
The movie was told earlier by the Evening News.
The game ended 0-0.
After the final, a large crowd of spectators rushed to the stadium to watch the show for HJK supporters.
The situation led to pushing and boxing between the teams' supporters.
The situation required, among other things, the use of cavalry.
In addition to the field, the explosion occurred near a nearby metro station, where some of the seizures also took place.
I wasn't there, but from what I saw in the pictures, the situation was unpleasant, Värtinen pointed to the explosion that took place on the field.
According to Värtinen, there have been no reports of any crime as a result of the events.
The table attack spoiled the butterfly's time in the SE World Cup, Laukkanen also swam to the final
Jenna Laukkanen and Riku Table Attack have advanced to the finals of the 3/7 World Cup of Swimming on the final day of competition in the Netherlands.
The races are held in Eindhoven on a short track.
The HSS's Pöytakivi broke Finland's record in the 50 meter butterfly, where he was second in the preliminaries with a time of 22.82.
In September, the table attack was carried out in Helsinki, with a time of 22.77.
Ari-Pekka Slickkoen, representing the Estonian province of Cetus, was 24.68 at the time of the butterfly launch.
Swimming Club Leukkanen was in the first round of the 50m breaststroke with a time of 30.48 and advanced to the final.
In the first round of the 200-meter mix, Laukkanen was 15th with a time of 2.14.25.
Students are playing a rare treat: the ancient tragedy of Orestes , a simplified one , is affected by its visual appearance .
Ancient tragedies are rarely sensitive on Finnish stages.
For example, the National Theatre was last seen in 1988 when the ancient tragedy, Sophocles' Philoktetes, was staged.
Now the School of Theatre has brought the only complete drama trilogy of antiquity, the Oresteia of the Aiskhylos, for a tour starting at the National Theatre.
The Lavat Open! projects launched in 2015 involve the international collaboration of theatre students with a professional director.
This fourth project, like the first, is being directed by Mikko Roiha, who lives in Berlin.
Oresteia made his international debut in Berlin in April.
The reconciliation of Roya with Oresteia summarizes the story of the end of the bloodshed of the condemned Atreus family and the birth of the rule of law, thanks to the hour and twenty minutes of the choral performances.
The work manages to be very faithful to the spirit of Kirsti Simonsur's fine Finnish work (2003).
The dramatic lights and the exposition on the sides of the theater highlight the simplistic and bright thinking of the stage.
It is centered on the dynamics between the performers who alternate to leave the choir, playing the titular roles, and the choir.
The show uses both double and triple-interpreters.
The actors never leave the stage, so for example, the murders of Agamemnon returning from the Trojan War and Cassandra in his war room are also shown on stage, unlike the ancient pre-tradiction.
Of course, the performance does not emphasize its loyalty to the ancient pre-tradition.
Rather, a modern, text-based interpretation is created before the eyes of the viewer, constantly aware of its ritual roots.
Roiha has succeeded in bringing up the master's degree students in acting as a tight group, literally as one organism, performing in a rhythmic ensemble.
In choir roles, especially, actors who are prone to highly expressive, sculptural group formations are allowed to access their rights in the open, only by decorating the white curtain on the stage.
That's impressive.
The Oresteia show tour continues at the Kouvola and Oulu Theatre.
Korean manufacturer manufactures its first water-coated belt
The innovation is beginning to be seen in Europe, in particular thanks to the cooperation agreement between Hyndas and H2 Energy, Switzerland.
According to the cooperation agreement published at the IAA in Hanover, Hyundai will supply the Swiss company and its partners with a new model of a thousand cars.
By introducing the fuel-powered truck to the market, Hyundai continues to be a manufacturer of hydrogen vehicles, referring to Nexon and ix35/Tucson Fuel Cell models.
With this project, the first of its kind in the world, we're taking fuel technology even further.
We are also continuously looking for opportunities to expand the market for these vehicles, for example by monitoring the development of the refuelling network", said In Cheol Lee, Vice President of Hyundai Motor at the announcement of the agreement.
The pests have been in Kajan many times .
A man in his early 30s assaulted three men in a restaurant in downtown Cajan and in front of it on Saturday morning.
The man first hit one man inside the restaurant, which resulted in him being removed.
When he was outside, he would push another man to the ground, and when the third man was not present, the assailant would hit him as well.
The police caught the assailant.
At the police station, the man continued to be aggressive and kicked another police officer in the leg.
He also threatened to assault and kill the police.
The man was taken to a prison to calm down.
The case is being investigated for three counts of assault and one count of violent resistance to a public official.
In the center of Cajan, on Interstate, there was another assault incident Saturday morning.
The victim was assaulted by two men.
First, a Cyanite man in his 20s beat the victim.
A little later, another man knocked her down and the man who had hit her earlier kicked the victim.
The outside forces pulled the assailants away from the victim and called the police.
But the perpetrators were able to leave before the police arrived.
The police are asking witnesses to contact the Kajan police by phone at 0295 416 520 or by email at investigativ.kainuu@poliisi.fi.
The long-running radio host Erkki Pälli is dead.
Erkki Pälli, known as a longtime journalist, died of cancer at the age of 83.
Radio host Erkki Pälli, 83, is dead.
He died of terminal liver cancer, which he shared on his Facebook page in March 2018.
This is a go.
Even the doctor has said it, day after day, he commented on his condition for the Evening Post a month ago.
The safety of trade and the safety of trade must be ensured
I got paid for my first newspaper story in 1984.
When you get a surprise in these yearbooks, it's usually big news.
When I wrote (Karialainen, September 27) about the insecurity of retail workers, I was surprised and even slightly angry at times.
I also spoke to Erika Kähärä, an expert in the working environment at the Association of Service Professionals (PAM).
He says the crime statistics don't tell us what the real situation is.
The problem is growing, even though employers say otherwise.
The police only know of cases that are clearly serious and many actual incidents of violence are not reported.
"Of course, companies have an obligation to keep up-to-date statistics on their safety status under the Occupational Safety and Health Act, but these statistics remain in internal use and are not collected anywhere", he said.
The statistics don't stop with mental injuries.
The problem with violent incidents has always been that they do not always result in physical injury.
However, psychological trauma can be far more serious than bruises and wounds.
It is difficult to distinguish between a violent situation and a threatening one when even a certain level of aggressive threat must be considered violent - even if there is no action.
Too many people are afraid at work when the actual act doesn't happen.
Some of the residential areas are unstable.
The store has gotten guards.
The opening hours of the shops were also a source of considerable media attention for the effect on seller safety.
"At that time many employers arranged security services, at least for nighttime hours, to prevent working alone", says Kähärä.
When nothing happens, we draw the wrong conclusions.
This would seem to have had an effective effect now, but this is creating a new negative trend.
When the security situation was kept in good control, the impression arose that the security was unnecessary.
Now, in many places, they're trying to find solutions that could eliminate the costly security services.
A minor abuse is a criminal offence against a lawyer, and it is understandable that a seller who has been abused does not want to investigate a criminal who usually lives near a store.
But under the same section of the 2011 law, a minor assault becomes the subject of the prosecutor's office if it occurs in the workplace.
I think we need a preview right now.
Next time a store aunt or uncle gets raped, the police should investigate and prosecute.
If the court put a few of the assailants in prison and sentenced them to a life sentence, things would be clean.
A society where the grocery store is to be open even in small towns almost day and night must ensure the safety of the grocery workers.
Heidi Sohlberg was checking out the Miss Universe before the live broadcast started.
Miss Universe crown this year will not be shown on TV as usual, but will be shown on the Viafree website.
The broadcast will be hosted by former Miss Finland Heidi Sohlberg and host Iiro Harjula of the NHL and KHL studios Viasat and Viaplay.
The backstage and the red carpet are designed by Janni Hussi.
Before the live broadcast, the channel told the guests and media representatives who had arrived at the venue about the progress of the broadcast.
At first, Sohlberg asked the audience to give Harry a heartfelt applause.
Now all the women scream!
Now look at this man-eater, Sohlberg, who was cheering his colleague's audience.
The first edition of the Miss Finland competition will be followed by many years earlier.
Among other things, Sara Chafak and Sara Sieppi sat next to each other and Sohlberg threw a little joke in either direction.
Sara, Iiro is married!
Sohlberg was looking at the Saro.
More likely, Sohlberg was referring to the recently divorced Siep, who laughed at the comments, although they seemed confused at first.
Sieppi first spoke about his divorce in the Evening News.
The Missing Woman said she doesn't want to go into details about the reasons for the divorce in public because it's between her and Roope Salm.
He said he wasn't in a hurry to start a new relationship, but he was going to focus on himself.
I'm focusing on my own business and especially living my own life alone, Sara Sieppi said.
Harjula's marriage came to light at a later stage when Sohlberg mistakenly called Janni Hus and Iiro Harjula a couple.
The plot trio laughs at the asshole.
I mean, Iro was married, or what?
Janni Hussi just gave me a receipt.
A northern man tortured a prisoner by cutting, burning and feeding a powerful bowl
A court in the Northern Territory has sentenced a 34-year-old man living in Kokkola to three years in prison for crimes against his ex-wife.
Among the criminal instruments were a belt, a cable and a wire.
The court ruled that the items were lost to the state.
The Rangi charge involved a suspect in a brutal rape.
However, the Court of Appeal dismissed this charge.
The co-conspirator was charged with four counts of assault, aggravated assault, coercion, illegal threat, indecent assault, indecent assault and two counts of assault.
The offences took place between 26 March and 24 May.
As a result of his last acts, the man was arrested and imprisoned a few days later.
Last Thursday, the Northern District Court issued its verdict and ordered the 34-year-old to remain in Vaasa prison.
No evidence of rape
The 34-year-old was also charged with two counts of aggravated assault and one count of aggravated rape on May 22.
However, the court dismissed these charges as unfounded.
The case was tried in court behind closed doors.
However, the appellant's judgment was published in a public statement.
The appellant's claim was that the defendant had targeted his spouse for violence, threats and coercion in situations where he had been bound.
The defendant cut the victim with a knife, burned a cigarette, fed a powerful cup, and poured water and coffee on him.
In its judgment, the court ordered the State to forfeit the means of crime: the belt and the cable, the spikes, the bathing belt, the knife and the toilet.
Four witnesses
The appellant submits that the parties continued to live together between the acts.
The verdict shows that most of the most heinous crimes occurred at the end of the crime period.
Four witnesses, two women and two men, were heard in court.
The 34-year-old victim is to be compensated for pain, injury, suffering and temporary harm for a total of EUR 5800.
He hardly has that kind of money, because the convict already has debts inherited from his father.
He's not the first man to go to jail.
The evening paper doesn't name the convicted person to protect the victim's privacy.
The recent court order is not legally binding at the time of writing.
Europe lead by four points in the Ryder Cup
European golf professionals have held their lead in the traditional hole game against the United States on Saturday.
Europe leads the Ryder Cup, which is being played in Paris, by 10-6 points, with 12 games to be played on Sunday.
Europe won three of the four four football matches that began on Saturday, and in the afternoon's four games the wins were tied 2-2.
The European champions were Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari, who won all four matches played by the pair on Friday and Saturday.
No European couple has ever had a match like this before.
On Sunday, the two of us are looking for more history.
No European player has ever won five points in a single Ryder Cup, and none of the Americans have won more than three: Arnold Palmer and Gardiner Dickinson (1969) and Larry Nelson (1979).
HJK condemns the disruption of the border by its supporters in the Honka match: "Violence is not part of football"
Football betting league team HJK released a statement on Sunday condemning the disruptive behaviour of its supporters at the FC Honka match on Saturday in Tapio.
"We apologize for the events after the Honka-HJK match on behalf of our supporters", the statement said.
After the match, about 50 HJK supporters rushed to the field and some appeared to be trying to challenge the Hong Kong supporters.
There was also a fight between the supporters.
The organizers were not able to calm down, but they needed police and cavalry.
HJK said in a statement that the players and staff were shocked by the incident.
The events after the game are not in keeping with the values of our 111-year-old company.
"We strongly reject any activity that threatens the safety of match events", the statement said.
HJK agrees to assist authorities and event organisers in identifying security threats and eliminating minor events.
The culture of the fans is part of football and it's important to the HJK.
We support positive, joyful and encouraging activities in football matches in every way possible.
"Violence is not part of it", says the statement.
A Filipino inventor flies in a drone car to avoid traffic jams
Mendiola is a Filipino inventor, hip-hop dancer and some kind of Pelle Feliz.
He's now part of a growing global movement that swears to have invented a flying car, or at least its own version.
As competitors, he has, for example, the likes of Audi and Airbus.
But Mendiola doesn't believe in mass production of their equipment.
According to reports from around the world, this man has spent a large part of his fortune building his dream.
He started developing his flying car six years ago.
Now he calls the development version a drone car.
Recently, he says he made the first successful test flight... he slipped on his device at over seven meters.
One of his goals was to avoid traffic jams.
I hope the device will generate a positive reaction.
This was just a dream five years ago, Mendiola said, according to the British Daily Mail.
JHL predicts that tomorrow 's work-fighting will be seen in childcare and social and health services
The public and welfare sectors will be affected by the overtime and shift ban, which will start tomorrow, particularly in social and health services and childcare, said JHL President Päivi Niemi-Laine.
The effects will be broad, and they will certainly be seen in the way that there is not enough staff on site.
Everyone has to think about how to get their baby.
"The job of the employer is now to make sure that the services are in play and that no one's life is at risk", Niemi-Laine tells STT.
According to Niemi-Laine, the decline in the number of employees was also evident at the beginning of the year, when JHL members were banned from overtime and shiftwork due to contract negotiations.
Employers have made it possible through flexibility that staff are not hired but are kept overtime or shifted.
This isn't a labor struggle yet.
It is the norm in terms of occupational safety that all workers are kept on a regular basis and that only those hours are worked.
JHL opposes the Government's intention to ease the protection of small businesses from redundancies.
The Director of the Labour Market for Local Employers, Markku Jalonen, does not take any prior assessment of the effects of overtime and shift restrictions.
However, he does not believe that they are very revolutionary, although services may deteriorate.
Employers across Finland are aware of this and have made the necessary preparations.
The area is so vast, social and health services and the technical sector that it is difficult to say.
The impact can vary greatly across industries, regions and employers, Jalonen told STT.
Jalonen says that experience was already gained last week from the three-day activities of the Intermediate and Primary Health Service (IMS) and the Social and Health Professionals' Organisation (SSH) in Tehri.
They had very little effect.
The JHL's overtime and shift ban applies to, among others, municipal, church, state and private social and health workers.
For example, family day care providers are restricted to outside.
The work at this stage concerns almost 100 000 members of the JHL.
According to Niemi-Laine, the JHL's actions may take a long time.
The Union is also prepared for other labour struggles if the drafting of the dismissal law continues.
The government should now admit that this is a wall-to-wall fight.
Jalosen believes that the Ay movement and the government must be opposed.
The strange thing about this is that the hard drive is already on the line, even though the show hasn't been released yet, according to Jalonen.
The Great Coral Reef is born of the power of children and adults . In the gyms of the show , we learn the movements of the rooster and the seahorse .
In other venues, the Great Coral Reefs premiered last spring in Hamburg and last Saturday it was performed a second time in Finland, this time at the Barn.
Like the group's previous work, The Great Coral Union is a work that is built from start to finish in collaboration with the audience.
However, this time a clearer presentation will also be built, which will refresh and mirror the observations made in the initial exercises.
There's plenty of magic in the theater for children.
The child's perspective has already been taken into account in the preparation of the work.
The Great Coral Union is not a children's show, however, but a show that adults and children do in collaboration.
It gives adults information and observations about the way children receive information and make art.
Children's ability to engage in exercise and play also blurs the gap between adults and children.
The Great Coral Reef may resemble a fairy tale ballet, a gym and a nature-based outlet, but eventually it is tuned into different, non-human environments surrounding the visits.
The Great Coral Reef begins with a survey of coral reefs and the trade routes of coral life and fish.
Six different gyms teach the movements of the rooster and the seahorse, among others.
Finally, a show of less than an hour's duration, with music, lights, and bright paintings and costumes, will help you to experience the life of the coral reef.
The Great Barrier Reef is home to both divers and the coral reefs they observe.
And we're also coral-observing creatures.
The various gazes and observations make the performance dense and life-affirming.
It's like a landscape of some life, a life looking at a landscape and another life looking at a life or a landscape and all of this at the same time.
It doesn't seem difficult for the kids.
In other settings, a group is struggling to push the boundaries of thought and action, which is challenging to reach when the group is made up of both children and adults.
On the other hand, the presence of children makes it more important.
After work, a silent protest will be held in Sitrator in support of endangered corals.
We should not allow the destruction beyond human comprehension to harden, even though it may be difficult to grasp the significance of our own practice of compassion in the face of the ravages.
In other places, the work has been constructed in such a way as to respect the diversity of life, including through political gestures.
There are other generations, different minds, different species, and future generations whose wonder and play is ripping up space.
Kids grow up too fast. I'm glad I didn't have smartphones when I was a kid.
Today's children and youth are becoming more irresponsible.
Young people start smoking and drinking younger and younger.
I think kids should be kids all their childhood, and not mess up their lives because of drugs and sex, because other people say they do.
I was shocked when my friend told me that he had to pick up his fifth-grade sister from a "boyfriend" over the weekend.
When she came to pick up her drunken sister, she told me about her sex experiences that night.
I couldn't imagine my own sister in the same situation because we've been told and warned all our childhood that we shouldn't touch drugs and sex is an adult thing.
I hope that today's children will be able to live a decent childhood and not have to grow up too early because of peer pressure.
I keep seeing younger and younger girls on Instagram wearing makeup and revealing their clothes.
SnapChat is used to take and send images that reveal the night.
It's even harder for girls to guess how old they are.
Today's 13-year-olds can easily look like 18-year-olds and parents.
My childhood was spent playing in the woods and playing board games.
I'm glad I didn't have smartphones when I was a kid.
I was a child for many years, and I didn't have to think about what other people thought of me.
General: The authorities have told the head of state that the case of Airiston Helmi is not related to national security
According to Yela's interview Ilkka Kanerva, security forces and the defence forces visited the defence and foreign affairs committees earlier this week to inform them.
The Finnish government has been informed that the investigation into the Airiston Helmen is not currently related to national security, but to organized crime, Yle reported.
The information of the anonymous sources was confirmed by Ilkka Kanerva, Chairman of the Defence Committee.
According to Kanerva, the defence forces and your security forces visited the Defense and Foreign Affairs committees this week to report on the ongoing investigation.
This is primarily considered a financial crime.
They were quite strict about not speculating that this was anything else, Kanerva commented in an interview with Yle.
According to the above information, no evidence of a connection to national security has been found so far, but the investigation is still ongoing.
We cannot yet know what that might reveal, says one of Yle's interviewees.
The large-scale house searches that began a week ago on the island of Turku and on the mainland have raised the question of whether the investigation is merely an economic crime or a threat to Finland's internal security.
The evening paper compiled a story earlier this week that reviews both the pros and cons.
Video: The dream painting saved Liverpool from a losing series
Liverpool's 100% Premier League debut came to an end, but it was still a more satisfying team in a 1-1 draw at Stamford Bridge.
Sunday will be exactly one year since Manchester City arrived at Stamford Bridge and ran away to a 1-0 away win.
That's when Pep Guardiola's combination sent a signal to the entire Premier League that City was serious.
Everybody remembers how last season ended.
And I'm sure Liverpool manager Jürgen Klopp arrived in West London with the same idea.
The Reds had started the season with six straight wins in the Premier League.
Liverpool started stronger and Virgil van Dijk in particular seemed to be in control of his own field.
Chelsea, for their part, had a great League Cup win on Wednesday at Anfield Road.
That's when Eden Hazard came off the bench to finish the game with a magnificent individual performance.
Now, of course, Hazard was with us from the very beginning.
In the 25th minute, he first scored in a small space with Mateo Kovacic and Jorginho in a three-game match.
Finally, the Croat saw Hazard jump forward and sent him a perfectly weighted passing paper.
Hazard drove a little to the edge of the penalty area, but from there he bombed a perfect left foot bet into the rear corner.
Paul's goalkeeper, Alisson, was a little slow in his fight and he couldn't get his finger on the ball.
Klopp must have felt the loss position slightly unfair, since almost immediately afterward Antonio Rüdiger had cleared Mo Salah's command of the field.
In the second episode, Chelsea striker Kepa also got into real action.
The goalkeeper quickly responded to Sadio Mane's bet and pushed the ball from the bottom of the ball into the corner.
At the other end, Alisson was knocked down by a throwing through Hazard.
The best spot for guests came in the 72nd minute when James Milner found Bobby Firmino in his focus.
However, the brass star's bust was directed at fellow countryman David Luiz, who saved the hosts' leadership position.
And that didn't last for another 89 minutes when the switchman, Daniel Sturridge, was able to free-fire from 25 yards.
Sturridge was playing at his old home stadium, and the attacker bombed an unrivaled bet in his honor.
Liverpool's 100% league start came to a 1-1 draw, but it's still in the top flight with Manchester City.
Chelsea are also very much in the championship game, two points behind the lead.
In the clockwork debate , the puzzles are deep .
I remember a few decades ago when a newspaper asked various Finnish influencers what divides the Finnish people.
Juice Leski's answer was the only thing that stuck with me:
Some people have a nose cap, some don't.
I mean, you can have a distribution line anywhere, and here was one of the vendors.
Finland has made it possible to abandon annual clock movements in the EU.
Many agree that clock movements twice a year have been foolish and have caused a wide variety of problems.
In the end, this achievement seems to be the easiest step in Finland, although it has not been easy.
The most difficult part is deciding which time it will end up at: the current summer or winter time, or some other time zone.
This will also give the public the opportunity to express their views on the page snapshot.fi.
The survey has been launched by the Ministry of Transport and Communications and is open until Friday 12 October.
There's a heated discussion at coffee tables and on social media, and everyone has their say.
Advocates of wintertime base their position on the influence of morning light on the well-being of people and defend the summertime on the influence of evening light on the outdoor environment and thus on the well-being of people.
Both sides have strong supporters and good reasons.
Studies have shown that morning light rhythms the day and gives a sense of urgency.
On the other hand, if you are not particularly affected by waking up in the dark, you can increase the light to people's movement outside and give them better opportunities to work in the backyard, for example, in the autumn.
The amount of light added after a normal working day has already been calculated.
I'd rather take both, but the bad news is that we're in the northern hemisphere and we can't do anything.
Winters are too dark and summers too bright for many anyway.
The typical topic of discussion is that one's views are being pursued and the other's views are being strongly opposed.
You don't really listen to the other party's argument because what matters most is how you feel about it.
Since almost everyone has an opinion, it is somewhat pointless to try to turn the other's head.
It's a waste of time.
The subject is extremely easy to discuss because it does not require much effort and a sense of loss is sufficient to justify it.
Similar matters are usually discussed more intensely and equally unproductively.
I'm sorry if the wrong option gets picked, but let's just adapt to it.
And it always offers a perfect sin, too, if life seems awkward.
Josba fought for the victory of the bastard stranger
Joss' first guest game in the divari salib band produced a full three points series against Nurma Jim.
Josba left the Wall River for home with a cheerful 6-5 (3-1, 0-3, 3-1) win.
Nurmo still led the lead in the third inning, but Josba picked up the ingredients and recycled the men in chains.
In 50.47, brothers Eetu and Juuso Lehtiniemi drew a 6-5 win.
The two teams played crucial minutes on a level playing field.
The most effective of these was the Juuso Lehtiniem (2+1).
The second wave was also a fire-force one, with Teemu Tuhkanen (1+1), Jere Kaartinen (1+0) and Jere Kettunen (1+0) also hitting.
Miika Kosonen (1+0) also scored a goal in the second half.
Josbal has six points after three rounds.
The next one will be O2-Jyväskylä in two weeks.
I'm going to church on Sunday for my 200th birthday.
The Church of Enon's 200th anniversary celebration will be held tomorrow Sunday in a somewhat sad atmosphere.
The fire that destroyed the Church of the Exaltation of the Holy Cross a week ago was a shock.
The church of Enon was guarded for two nights after the fire.
Despite the pain, today is still a party.
Although no one would like to, Enon's Church is now the oldest church in the Congregation of the Joensuu.
The church on the hill in the middle of the village has always been the heart of Enon, despite all the townships and other associations in the world.
Family service begins at Enon Church today at 10:00 a.m.
Then we move to the congregation hall, to the cattle-feeding table.
There's a lot of stuff on the program all day, inside and out.
For example, you can visit the church building under the direction of retired local mayor Ari Räsäsäs, who served as the church's mayor for 37 years.
The Church's birthday also marks the end of an era.
The church building, which has been decommissioned since 1982, will open its doors for the last time today.
Now we're in the middle of a former town hall, says Mark Koistinen.
The church building was destroyed by air pollution, but the church has stood in its place for 200 years.
Elon Musk steps down as Tesla's chairman of the board - Fraud charges settled for $40 million
Electric car manufacturer Tesla and CEO Elon Musk have reached a settlement with the SEC, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
The SEC suspected Musk of committing securities fraud, and Musk was in danger of being ousted from the company he founded.
But Musk will be allowed to continue as Tesla's CEO.
Instead, Musk will be forced to step down as Tesla's chairman of the board for three years.
The company will have to hire the chairman of the board from outside.
Musk will also be subjected to stricter surveillance.
The agreement requires Tesla to hire two independent executives and to monitor Musk's communications more closely in the future.
In addition, Tesla and Musk both pay $20 million to settle the case.
"The decision is intended to prevent further market disruptions and disadvantages to Tesla shareholders", says SEC Director Steven Peik.
The case began in August when Musk tweeted that he might pull the company out of the stock market.
Musk also wrote that the company's financing is secure.
The tweet temporarily raised Tesla's share price.
The SEC suspected Musk of committing securities fraud.
The agency said the tweet was false and misleading and that Musk had not discussed the arrangement with other executives or potential investors.
In practice, the agency accused Musky of misleading investors.
The SEC announced Friday that it would sue the company and Musk.
The SEC said it was demanding that Musk be fined and banned from running stock companies.
The SEC's challenge scared investors, and Tesla's stock plunged sharply.
More than 800 people died in the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia
The death toll from the Indonesian earthquake and tsunami has risen to at least 832, according to the country's disaster bureau, AFP news agency.
The death toll is expected to rise as the damage is still being worked out.
Vice President Jusuf Kalla said the final figure could be as high as a thousand.
Friday's earthquake triggered a tsunami that struck the town of Palun on Sulawes Island.
The tsunami was immediately alerted after the earthquake, but was quickly cancelled.
Officials say almost all of the dead known to us are from Palus, at least for now.
Rescue authorities are concerned, among other things, about the Donggala area near the epicentre of the earthquake, where the situation is still largely unclear.
We already know a lot of people have died.
Requests for Help from Ruins
The Indonesian army has been alerted to help rescue workers search for victims.
President Joko Widodo, who arrived in the area today, urged the troops to continue their rescue work without tiring day and night.
One of the rescue operations is centered at a hotel in Palus, which is believed to still hold 50 to 60 people in the ruins.
Muhammad Syaugi, head of the rescue agency, said one person was found alive in the ruins of the business traveler's favorite Roa-Roa hotel after being dug up overnight.
We also heard people crying out for help, he said.
According to Syaug, the earthquake and tsunami area would quickly need heavy razor blasting equipment.
Many Indonesians have turned to Facebook and other social media to find their missing loved ones.
Help me, you in the Palace and nearby.
A friend of mine's family is still missing, and one of the writers appealed to me on a Facebook group.
The political phone numbers leaked to the disruptors in Britain
Many British politicians were harassed when their contact details were leaked because of the encryption flaws.
The interference was made by the Ministers' telephone numbers.
It was an app used at the Conservative Party Congress in the UK.
For example, Brexit-driven Minister for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Michael Gove and former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson were harassed.
Several MPs received disturbing calls.
The app's encryption was delayed and the public was able to access the profiles of politicians who were on the mobile app of the annual convention of the Conservative Party.
The public accessed the profiles using the politician's email address, which was readily available online.
The person logging in to the profile was able to view and edit the material stored in the profile.
Someone managed to swap the pornographic image for a brief moment for Boris Johnson's profile picture and the title for an insult.
The profile picture of Michael Goven was replaced by a picture of Rupert Murdoch, a media mogul.
Dawn Foster, a columnist for The Guardian, described the problem by writing that the meeting app allows you to log into other people's profiles using their email addresses.
Then the logged-in can view the profile person's contact information and perhaps send messages on their behalf.
The meeting app made the phone numbers of every reporter, politician, and participant public, Foster said.
A Conservative Party spokesman apologized for the leak.
He said the technical issues were resolved and the app was now running safely.
The UK's ICO is supporting the data breach.
The app was developed by Crown Comms, an Australian company.
The opposition Labour Party has criticized the Conservative Party for not being trusted in security matters.
Every week, the audience of The Wall Finland receives a large number of striking Poles.
The attentive viewers paid attention to the reactions of the studio audience to the TV program The Wall Finland.
The world's fastest-growing American format, The Wall, was released on the Finnish version of Fourth on Saturday.
The game show, hosted by Weikki Paasosen, is filmed in Poland at the same studio where other international productions of the format are made.
The Polish studio had exceptional filming opportunities, as the format was a 12-meter-high toy that required space.
During the initial period, the social media featured a studio audience of the programme, who were accused of being Polish.
Twitter has sparked a debate about whether the Poles sitting in the studio might understand anything about the game being played in Finland.
The head of the four domestic programs, Unne Ringen, is giving the evening news.
He says that the studio audience includes close friends of the players, other Finns, foreigners living in Poland and even Polish viewers.
The audience consists of international applauders in Finnish production, as do the audiences of The Wall episodes filmed in the same production facilities in other countries.
In Finland, there are also such groups, so-called professional audiences, who attend the screenings of various programmes.
He reminds us that watching the game itself is not so difficult, even if we do not understand the language in which it is played.
The red and green balls falling off the wall are easy to tell apart.
However, the foreign-language studio has interpreters who handle the translation work.
There are two interpreters who interpret the events as a simulation for the studio director.
And the studio director then instructs the audience and tells them what kind of tape is being thrown there, for example, and what the situation is going on, says Ring.
He compares the situation to the way David Hasselhoff was handled in the domestic production the other day.
David Hasselhoff was a part of the talent show Talent Finland a few years ago.
He kept getting a simulation interpretation in his ear and knew everything that was spoken in Finnish in the pictures, the sum of the rings.
Typhoon raging south of Japan is moving towards the main island, authorities warn of landslides and flooding
Authorities also warn of possible landslides and floods.
At least 50 people were injured in the typhoon Tram, but authorities say serious injuries have been avoided and there are no deaths.
On the southern island of Okinawa, the wind has been so strong that it has turned cars around.
According to NHK, people have been evacuated to shelters and power has been cut off in more than 300,000 households.
Over a thousand flights have been canceled, and bullet trains are at their stops due to the storm.
The storm is expected to strike near Osaka in the afternoon, Finnish time.
The capital, Tokyo, is not directly on the path of the storm, but it also has strong winds and rain.
The train shifts have been canceled in Tokyo today.
Climate scientists say the tram will torture Japan until Monday.
The sky of the asses darkened further
The asses have had a bad start to the season.
The sky was almost dark as the team lost on Saturday at home to Vaasan Sportil on a score of 3-6 (0-2, 0-3, 3-1).
The Borisians now have five straight losses, and points from six rounds total two.
No Ace defender or player from the lower two chains has painted yet.
The pressure is also increasing.
The sport against the crowd was all in your hands at the time when the game was almost half over.
We've only played six games, and of course, there's no reason to give up.
You should be worried, because we played so poorly.
The second act was a shameful performance, as Jarno Kärki, who made the 1+2 effects for Ace, told us.
The sport, of course, enjoyed the win.
The team had a game down Friday, so I would've thought it was gonna show up in the making.
Maybe it was obvious, but the Ass didn't know how to use it.
The number of visitors to the Bread Day continued to increase
Mother of the day, Pirkko Goodvarinen, marvels at the crowd in the big hall.
Somehow he thought that maybe not so many people would come this year, the Good One thinks in the morning.
In the autumn of 2017, the SM-tractor race was held at the same time as Bread Day, so perhaps the expectation would be that the audience might even decrease slightly from the previous year.
However, the opposite happened: the corridors were blocked by ten o'clock, the sellers reported that the products were finished, the news was sold almost 500 times more than before and the number of cars was also on the rise.
The estimated number of visitors has been about 6,000, the Goodwill will report later this afternoon.
The five-hour programming sessions of the morning and afternoon were especially suitable for families with children, which attracted them to a record-breaking number of sessions.
The good man also estimates that the event will go further.
Every year, the vendors also turn to Lipper from a larger area.
This year, nearly a hundred presenters, craftsmen, bakers and harvesters had arrived at the bakery.
The Mother of Bread Day, Pirko The Good, admired the crowd watching the hall.
At the beginning of the Feast of Unleavened Bread, the harvest was blessed.
In the children's series, "The Beautiful Bread of the Stone Age" won the audience vote.
The children's bread competition featured 11 different types of bread.
The winner of the rosé-cake competition, Marjatta Vepsäläinen, spent the day in the pie shop on Tuesday.
7 times the beautiful light. This is how you know a good lamp.
Bring the atmosphere to life, create the right mood for the decor, and read the book without losing your eyesight.
It's worth a shot at a good light.
We have put together three good reasons to invest in enlightenment.
Vinkit was given to Tarja Jokiniemi, Innolux's head of sales and marketing.
Do your eyes a favor.
The more years are left behind, the more the significance of enlightenment grows.
Enough light can help many to cope with the problems of aging, which are caused by decreased vision and increasingly severe dizziness.
As parents grow, so does their need for light.
A 60-year-old needs three times as much light as a 20-year-old.
So the effects of light and its properties should be considered for health reasons.
I'd like to give you enough light, but don't be so bright, Jokiniem tells me.
Make a beautiful world around you
The only way to get a beautiful decor is with the right lighting solutions.
The decorator of this moment has a choice.
The popularity of the style is Japanese, combining animation, Scandinavian hair and Japanese.
On the other hand, the modern and playful retro style, inspired by the 1970s, with its strong colors, metallic hues, and ice cream colors, has grown into a boom.
The truth is as fascinating as any other home decor.
The materials now include wood, concrete, ceramics, paper, leather, and bamboo.
Show Your Personality
On the other hand, more people are investing in homes now than ever before, and decorating has become a way of expressing themselves.
Instead of mass production, we want our own home to be a custom, bold lighthouse with a story to tell.
People clearly seek Finnish and Nordic products, whose origins and designers are known.
So let's be very design-aware, says Jokiniemi.
You may not be buying the latest trendy headlights at home, but a timeless classic that has been saved for many years.
"Some of the finer, more ornate and elegant classics will be coming out of the closet year after year", says Jokiniemi.
Thank you, and goodbye!
KooKoo showed the door to the Canadian forward after three games.
The paths of KooKoo and attacker Brendan O'Donnell are crossed.
The Canadian forward played a total of three League games in orange jersey without any power points, KooKoo said in a statement.
O'Donnell joined KooKo in August on a one-year contract, which included a trial period until the end of September.
Last season, the 26-year-old striker played for the Kunlund Red Star in the KHL and the KHL farm in the VHL KRS Heilongjiang.
We don't know anything about O'Donnell's new company yet.
The player wants to set an example in recycling. The goods go out into the world in recycled boxes, plastic is replaced by paper.
Today, the game specialist, Peliman, recycles not only games but also packaging materials.
The products of customers of the stone shops are no longer packaged in plastic bags but in paper bags made from recycled materials.
For example, products ordered from online stores are packaged in packages from importers.
All the packages that come to us are reused.
We may use the boxes dozens of times, as long as the package is in good condition, so that it can be used, says Ville Puurula of the Oulu Game Man.
As a soft material, the company mainly uses newspapers and other similar recycled materials.
Avoid the cluster of bubbles as far as possible.
We're planning to move to recycling material in envelopes soon.
The movement wants to set an example for others.
According to Crouch, recycling is not an extra effort.
It's not a big deal to start recycling.
This will also save money when, for example, the packaging of cereals is reused.
Recycling is a natural feature of the company, as the new products are also part of the core product range of the company, including used games and equipment.
Purchasing every fashion expert: The same shirt works in every outfit
Classic clothes work from season to season in a different outfit than a suit.
Their versatility creates a good foundation for a good wardrobe, as it is easy to assemble a variety of costumes around high-quality classics at affordable prices.
In the fall, the most commonly used clothing items are high-quality needles.
This category includes the black polar.
Black needle semi-trailers made of natural materials cannot be faulty.
The garment can be combined with straight pants, a dull skirt, and a flip-flop, and can be surrounded by a controlled housing complex and a dirty style.
The pool plane is suitable for both a young person's modern dress and a classic, elegant style.
That's how you make it.
The fall trend line is born of golden-colored and brightly colored jeans, black polar jeans, and gray ankles.
The classic polar ice cream, along with the other classic blue-green scotch-boxed and wine-red loafers, forms a feminine and refined housing complex.
Bring the black polar bear a touch of flair by combining it with the latest in casual clothing: flip-flops, high-heeled shoes, and thick socks.
Young and stylish!
The Russian intelligence services have a long tradition of sabotage.
There is no reason to assume that the Russian Federation Foreign Intelligence Service SVR or the GRU would have abandoned this approach.
During the Soviet era, so-called DRG groups specialized in sabotage.
The name comes from the Russian word for diversionist group: sabotage and intelligence group.
KGB agents in the Western countries of the Soviet Union prepared detailed plans for important sabotage sites, reports Vasili Mitrohin, KGB archivist who had invaded the West (1922-2004).
His information was published in the books of Christopher Andrew in the late 1990s and early 2000s.
The targets included ports, docks, large dams, oil refineries and gas pipelines.
In Germany, the KGB procured DRG teams uniforms and equipment for covert operations of the Bundeswehr, railways, coastguards and security personnel.
This tactic was used by Russian paratroopers in Crimea in February 2014: they dressed up in local Ukrainian police noise equipment, set up checkpoints on the peninsula for Ukrainian leaders and isolated Crimea from its motherland.
During the Cold War, agents hid supplies in the countryside for sabotage groups, containing mines, explosives, incendiaries, and communications equipment.
Back in 1998, a KGB cache was discovered in Switzerland, where an anandamine explosive device exploded when authorities sprayed it with water.
Police caught four drunk drivers in the county last night.
Police have arrested four drunk drivers in North Kerala between Friday and Saturday night.
In June, an 18-year-old man with a condom blew 1.57 promile.
He drove two passengers at 4:30 at night in the early stages of the Cajanification.
At the Quirearanti of the Polvijärv, a car crashed into a lane at 4 p.m. and a 19-year-old local man, who was alone in the car, blew 1.54 perimeter, police said.
He didn't get any serious injuries while outdoors.
A 20-year-old outsider driving a passenger car in the center of Outokumpu blew a 1.33-gram radius into the alcometer.
Police suspect the men involved of drunk driving and, in addition to the driver of the Knee Lake, of endangering traffic safety.
On Saturday morning at the intersection of Öllöyänten and Hoikanten in Tuupájá, a 36-year-old man driving a local van blew 0.52 per milliliters.
He's under suspicion of driving under the influence.
Police are requesting observations of a stabbing incident at the Turku railway station after midnight.
Police say the man was assaulted in a parking lot outside the station with life-threatening consequences.
The deed was recorded on the surveillance camera.
The black-haired suspects, dressed in dark pants and brown or beige jackets, left immediately after the stabbing in a dark farm car heading for the railway station.
One of the suspects was cycling off Humalis Street towards the city center.
A pedestrian died after freezing under a bus in Poroshenko.
A pedestrian died in Porissa early Saturday morning after a bus hit him.
The accident happened just after 4am on the Raumanti Road near Niittuma.
The driver of the van is not suspected of a crime.
Police are investigating the events leading up to the accident.
HPK will keep Riska in their ranks for the rest of the season.
Mika Toivola, head of sports at Hämeenlinnan HPK, says Filip Riska (center) has been an important player for the team in the starting line-up, in the under-power play and in the defensive role of the quarter-back.
Filip Riska, who played from the beginning, will continue his career at Hämeenlinnen HPK.
The success of the experienced Riskan, 33, in the roles offered to him convinced the crew.
Philip has been a big part of our start-up, under-the-field play, and the defensive line.
While there is still room for improvement, the youth team should stick with such an experienced player, said Mika Toivola, HPK's sports director.
I'm hoping that the value of Risk will increase as the Ice Hockey League plays its final games.
The centre-forward from St. Petersburg, Riska has previously played for JYP, Lukos and Sport.
Instead, gunman Oskari Lehtinen was left without a contract after the test.
True story on TV today:
American Beck Weathers wrote a book 18 years ago.
Left for Dead: My Journey Home From Everest is based on a man's own experiences.
The movie tonight is based on them.
Everest is now premiering on Finnish TV.
In May 1996, a devastating snowstorm struck climbers on Mount Everest.
The 2015 report by Baltasar Kormákur describes a survival struggle that has been tackled in the field.
Tragedy has been made into films and documentaries before.
The facts are also being examined in this case.
The world's tallest mountain took the lives of eight climbers 22 years ago.
Two of them were experienced expedition leaders, Scott Fischer and Rob Hall.
It was Hall who was the guide of Weathers.
Weathers' life may have been saved by an eye surgery performed before he left for Nepal.
As a result of that and the pressure of the air, he lost his sight, and the conquest of the summit had to be abandoned.
Rob Hall went on his journey and never came back.
But Weathers' struggle for life and death had only just begun.
When the storm hit, he got lost and never found his way back to camp.
When they came looking for the man, they found him in such a bad condition that they didn't believe he was going to survive.
Weathers was left for dead.
But, by some miracle, he still got back on his feet and found others.
The most burned-out Weathers was thought to still be dying, and once again he was left to his own devices.
It's clear that, contrary to expectations, Beck Weathers survived.
At some point, even his associates began to believe in the possibility of it so much that he was given help.
In the movie, Beck Weathers is played by Josh Brolin.
Rob Hall is Jason Clarke and Scott Fischer is Jake Gyllenhaal.
Other roles include Robin Wright, Keira Knightley and Emily Watson.
Today is the 200th anniversary of the church of Enon.
Uncle's 200-year-old church is being celebrated today on the church's feast day.
The church was dedicated on October 4, 1818, and a family feast was prepared for the feast day on Sunday.
The festivities began at 10 a.m. at Enon's church, followed by a cattle feast at Enon's congregation hall.
The church was full.
The family meeting was attended by 517 people.
Uncle Armi, the pastor of Iron Mountain, was glad that so many people had come to the church.
It is a great joy for a long time to come and gives strength to the work", says Iron Mountain (pictured).
The fire of the church of the danger of fervor has touched many, and it was not ignored at the celebration of the 200th anniversary of the congregation of Enon.
The church of Enon is now the oldest Evangelical Lutheran church in Joensuu after the fire destroyed the Church of the Peril of the Enlightenment.
The wooden church of the danger of exaltation was completed in 1770.
In the morning, a prayer service was held in the vicinity, where the church was silenced and commemorated.
Pictures and videos: Medican spark in Greece - the sea disappears and the street turns into a river
A powerful hurricane-type autumn storm swept through Greece from noon Saturday.
The Mediterranean hurricane, or Medican, is called Zorba.
The Greek Meteorological Institute has issued a red weather warning for the areas of Attica, Peloponnese, Ionian Islands, Cyclades and Crete.
The images from the area show a flood of floods throughout Greece.
A video posted on Twitter shows how a river suddenly appeared between houses in the city of Kyoto in the Corinthian region, instead of a street because of floods.
The second video shows the car being flooded.
In the southern Peloponnese peninsula, strong winds caused heavy sea travel.
The Finnish Embassy in Athens has instructed people on its Facebook page to prepare for the storm in Greece.
The Mission calls for the monitoring of weather reports and local authorities' guidance.
The Mediterranean hurricane, or Medican, brings heavy rains and even flooding.
According to a 2011 study by CNN, meds appear only once or twice a year around the world, typically in the winter months of September and October, when sea temperatures are still high.
The storm left its tracks in Tunisia and Libya before moving northward and into Europe.
The Greek refugee camps on the islands, such as Lesbos, have also been a source of concern.
The thousands of Syrian and Iraqi refugees living in the camps have limited access to adequate protection.
The storm also affected areas around Athens that were destroyed by wildfires in the summer.
In Greece, we had a medical doctor in November last year.
The sea is now off limits, but flights are still on schedule.
Sea trips are canceled, and even on foot, be careful not to fly branches or other cargoes in a storm.
Such instructions have been given by the guides to 3,500 Finns in Greece who are on holiday during the weekend.
Guidelines will be needed, as even the horrifying Zorbas is predicted to hit the Greek islands this weekend.
For example, near the island of Crete, wind speeds in the bushes can reach up to 100 feet [45 m] per second.
The weather is just a little bit more violent than the heavy rains.
According to the tour operators, all travellers who have given their phone number to Finland from Greece via the Sun and the Danube have been warned of the strong winds by text message.
♪ Still sunshine and heat ♪
According to Inka Ikosen, a sunset communications expert, the worst has been avoided in the holiday resorts by early Saturday.
For example, flights have landed and taken off on normal schedules.
Of course, we're following the situation all the time.
Security comes first.
According to Antonia Schroderus, a media reporter for the aid, their flights have also been on schedule.
We're in constant contact with our personnel at the target.
At least it was still quiet on Crete, he told me early Saturday night.
The most popular Greek islands, Rhodes and Crete, currently have a total of 1,500 Finnish travellers.
In addition, a few hundred passengers are on holiday in smaller destinations.
For example, the worst storm on Kosin Island will hit Sunday morning.
On the other hand, on Saturday afternoon, Rhodes had been mocking the sun and the temperature had plunged to 27 degrees, reports the Sunrise Icon.
Zorbacs is expected to be the next Turkish to take over, albeit with a slightly lightened grip.
We have already been in contact with Turkey and our staff there, and have checked, for example, the number of Finnish people flying Antalya Aid, says Schroderus.
Shirly Karvis and Janni Huss , wearing exactly the same evening gowns in the Miss Universe final , this is how they reacted to the situation .
As a media personality and fitness beauty, Janni Hussi arrived at the final of Miss Finland on Saturday in a light-skinned evening dress.
Hussi says he bought the dress from Meslew.
I went out and decided to trust the professionals who found me a perfectly beautiful dress for this evening, Husky smiles.
The same silver evening gown was also chosen by the designer Shirly Havinen.
The twins themselves noticed similar outfits and laughed.
He told Night Singer that he was in a rush to prepare and that he had to get on a plane.
Hussi is the backstage and red carpet producer for the mississippi finals, and he talks to the front row stars who come to the scene.
Huss has a new move in the back, because he moved from Kamp to the Big Island on Friday.
I'm gonna stay there for now, see what happens.
It's important that the new apartment has its own study, Hussi thought.
Before moving, Hussi was on vacation alone in Greece.
It was wonderful. I was only in a hotel for a week and never left.
When the stress started, I got the flu, but by the way, the vacation was a real success, Hussi says.
Shirly 's behavior on the plane attracted a lot of attention .
June and Miss Finland 2016 Shirly Karvinen told the Miss Finland final red carpet she had enough to do with the radio broadcasts and Love Island Finland imagery.
The speed has been enough to get Karvinen to the final straight from Finnair.
I did makeup and put my hair on the plane.
This is the glamour.
I'm changing at home, and the hairy guy's laughing.
And now, he says he's been putting on makeup for the rest of the seniors.
His preparation also attracted the attention of fellow travelers.
I had a big mirror and I saw mirrored people's faces.
I was a little funny, at least to others.
The hairy one flies to Spain once a week.
He spends about a few days at a time in Marbella.
He says he enjoyed his time at Love Island as a Finnish planner.
He describes his experience so far as being also stop-and-go.
And, uh, hairy says she went to the show on Friday to pick up singles.
It's kind of raw.
It's the real feelings of people. The hairy guy describes the feelings of singles on the show.
How do I wear the top-flight shoes?
Three Perfect Examples
Classic clothes are clothing items that work from season to season in different outfits than in clothes.
Often, the classics are decades old, but sometimes they can accommodate even the most modern individuals.
A few years ago, the super-generation shoes that became the summer and winter hitmen have gone nowhere.
As the name implies, the shoes that go up to the knee are stylish and repetitive from year to year and season to season.
Looking at shoes, you share the opinions of the users, but a bold model is worth trying, well, bold.
After all, high-end shoes are suitable for virtually any type of living space.
Whether it's a tail, a pizza, a titty, or a shirt, the simple leather or fabric of shoes works.
Long shoes look great in party class and in everyday clothes.
Black high-end shoes are perfect for even the most fucked up living quarters.
They balance the femininity of the pink, flowery plissery and the shiny, thick needle.
A lavish but stylish autumn costume for romantic taste.
A strong and somewhat retro-inspired housing complex is the result of a long copper-brown fabric, high-heeled shoes, prominent earrings and a grass-cutting curtain.
While the high-end shoes have a certain elegance, they also fit perfectly into casual everyday wear, along with a t-shirt, long shorts, and trendy slippers.
It's so easy and yet so stylish!
Two robot cars are starting to move around Espoo
They will operate for the rest of the year and take passengers on board, Espoo City reports.
The robot cars of the region will act as a bus simulator, as the area is expected to be operated by a robotic bus next spring.
The project will develop and pilot year-round robotic vehicle transport and test the technical performance of the vehicles in Finnish conditions.
The experiment will show how the robot cars are doing on the current street grid.
At the same time, the city offers robot bus developers the opportunity to develop the technology in a real environment, says Johanna Nyberg, chief traffic officer.
For the first time ever, robotic cars are fully automated in other traffic without any special transportation arrangements.
The safety of vehicles shall always be the responsibility of the passenger in the vehicle.
The vehicles were constantly sensing their surroundings with several different sensors and assessing whether the lane was clear.
If not, they will interpret whether the obstacle is a vehicle, a bicycle or a snowmobile, for example, says Harri Santamala, CEO of Sensible 4, responsible for the development of robotic transport.
The robot cars will run three days a week throughout the autumn: Tuesdays from 1 to 15.30, Wednesdays from 10 to 15 and Thursdays from 10 to 15.
The robots will stop at six stops along the route and take passengers on board.
The robot car stops are identifiable by the stop signs.
The safest way to get on board is at the number one stop in Otkaare.
The Mokoma bassist fell off the stage in the middle of a show and got hurt.
The Mokoma group is announcing a surprise situation at the Tampere Baking Room.
The band's performance at the Tampere Packaging Room took a dramatic turn on Saturday when bassist Santtu Hämäläinen fell off the stage.
The situation was bad when the band was pulling the last track of the night.
The beach of this place is broken.
The band will be posting it on their Facebook page.
"We are in the spirit!"
Santtu stumbled on the stage in the bakery last whistle yesterday and broke his wrist.
Let's hope for a speedy recovery for the metal brother!
The rest of the tour is run by a deputy team, the pages say.
Fans of Mokoma respond with concern to the photo-journal where bassist Santtu lies with a pin in her hand on the bed.
This news has been expected, there was a pretty big concern about how badly it went.
It's a great relief, and luckily, the bones will heal over time.
A quick and easy recovery for Santa and a good tour for the rest of the band plus a lucky one!
And thanks for yesterday's show, it was great, but you promise to leave out the end of this dramatic show?
Police are monitoring hunting in North Karachi and Savoy.
The Eastern Finnish Police Department conducted hunting surveillance on Friday and Saturday with the Forestry Authority and the Finnish Harvest Centre in North Karelia and Upper Saxony, police unit officials said on social media on Saturday.
The main focus of the control was on the legality and authorization of hunting.
Each hunter was checked for a hunting card and a state hunting licence.
In addition, the authorised holdings of hunting weapons and the permitted patrols of seawater weapons for sewerage were checked.
Police said 112 hunters were inspected during the surveillance, and only one hunter was found during the surveillance, who lacked the required hunting license.
The hunter was given 12 days' probation for an unauthorized request.
Police also blew up 133 drivers, two of whom are suspected of drunk driving.
The patrol also handled five traffic offences in a fine process, police at one time.
In summary, hunters are very well aware of the authorisation of hunting.
Many hunters were surprised by the surveillance.
One hunter said that "I've been hunting in the area for 50 years and this is the first time anyone has checked permits".
The Eastern Finnish Police Department will continue to monitor hunting in the autumn together with other supervisory authorities.
Mykkänen is leaving for Turkey to monitor the selection of Syrian quota refugees
Minister of the Interior Kai Mykkinen (co) will travel to Turkey in the coming days to monitor the selection of quota refugees arriving in Finland.
Finland has decided to take 530 Syrian refugees from Turkish refugee camps this year.
Election trips are usually made a couple of times a year, with representatives from the Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the Ministry of Labour and the Economy and the police.
The delegation is already conducting interviews in Turkey.
The UN refugee agency UNHCR first selects people in a particularly vulnerable position for the nomination.
In practice, it has meant people who are considered to be in a particularly vulnerable position in refugee camps, such as single-parent families, the disabled and sick, women and children.
More people are selected for the group to come to Finland than there are in the quota, as in practice some are not present for various reasons.
Mr Mykken also met with Turkish Interior Minister Süleyman's NGOs on the border with Soylum and Syria.
The trip will also be attended by the Home Office's Chief of Staff, Ilkka Salmi.
The quota was raised
Finland has been taking in Quantium refugees since the 1970s.
In recent years, the quota has been 750 refugees a year.
The quota was for a couple of years at 1050 years, but the Board has not agreed to raise it since then.
The Assembly has supported the quota increase, but the project has recently fallen out of favor.
Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (Central) recently proposed a gradual increase in the quota for 1 500 to 2 000 persons per year.
The visit by Mr Mykes is the first of the Ministry of the Interior's visit to the area during this government period to monitor the selection of quota refugees.
The former Ministers of the Interior, Petteri Orpo (Co) and Paula Risko (Co), were given the opportunity to move to their new posts before the visits could be arranged.
Finland receives EUR 10 000 in EU aid for each refugee in a particularly vulnerable situation.
Now we're going to the gym. We don't know whether to laugh or cry.
Last Saturday, the cattle ranch announced a bill to amend the animal welfare act.
The article was understood as prohibiting in principle the keeping of all animals which are not separately permitted by ministerial regulations as far as production animals, pets or other business activities are concerned.
In other words, everything else is prohibited in principle except the animals mentioned in the Regulation.
If the bill ends up being secular, it means that we are abandoning the general principle in Western democracies that the law specifically prohibits activities that endanger the security of society or good morals.
We are now in the process of prohibiting in principle all activities which are not specifically permitted by law or regulation.
The change will mean that nothing new can be tried, for example in business, and nothing else can be done until a law or regulation approves it.
The government's legislative efforts have generally been weak.
If we go to the point where everything is prohibited in Finland, which is not allowed, we will not know whether to laugh or cry.
I have no doubt that the animal welfare act would require an update.
But this bill is not a democracy.
I am not very familiar with the Constitution, unfortunately, but I wonder if it would accept this "anything is forbidden, anything that is not specifically permitted by law or regulation".
I hope there's a sensible minister who can stop this kind of legislation.
For a tip from Forssell, the four most trendy hats of the fall
This fall's trendy dress is coming in the snake months.
It looks especially good in the pants.
Combine a snake-moon skirt with a restrained top, such as a polo or a regular t-shirt, to keep the whole family stylish.
This fall, silk is a staple of the season, and silk dress in particular is one of the most trendy garments of the season.
Combine the beautiful silk shirt with the feminine top or relax the needle pair.
You can play with silk and throw your shoes at them, like sneakers or fall trendy cowboy boots.
Whether gray, brown, or multi-colored, all the square skirts are now a must-have for every woman.
Bravely combine different colors and play with the rose-colored area even during the special season on top.
For example, a combination of a square and a square is beautiful.
Asymmetrical pearls are a breeze of summer's lightness, which you can take with you into autumn.
The asymmetrical pearl is feminine and playful, and is perfect for both art and celebration.

In Turkey , people are being urged to charge their cell phones in case of a storm .
The Zorba storm that hit Greece on Saturday is expected to make its way to Turkey on Sunday.
On Saturday, meteorologists warned sailors, fishermen, and farmers on the country's west coast, especially, of the storm in Greece, reports CNN Türk.
A tropical storm is reported to move along the coast from south to north during the day.
Disaster and emergency officials urged citizens early Saturday night to charge their mobile phones before the storm and ensure internet access to keep people updated, local news agency Anadolu Ajansi reported.
People are encouraged to stay at home and away from windows, and to move, for example, garden furniture away from the wind.
Heavy rain is expected in Turkey and winds are expected to blow at 28-33 meters per second.
Red weather warning in Greece
On Saturday, the Greek Meteorological Service issued a red weather warning for the southern Greek regions of Attica, Peloponnese, Ionian Islands, Cyclades and Crete.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Greek travel agencies warned Finns in Greece of the Zorba storm.
The Finnish Embassy in Athens also issued a storm warning.
Travelers were encouraged to follow weather reports and local authorities' instructions.
A while ago, when I contacted you, it was raining and windy.
People were very calm, communications director Laura Aaltonen of the Tui travel agency told STT on Saturday.
Aaltonen described the situation as similar on Saturday night.
By evening, the Foreign Ministry had also received no messages from Finns in need.
In Greece, several ports were closed on Saturday, local news agency Amna reported.
All ferry services to the sea were canceled on Saturday, the travel agency told STT.
According to the Finnish Embassy in Athens, temporary disruptions to air and sea transport were expected.
Finnair was informed on Saturday that the weather was being actively monitored.
Kimi Raikkonen explained why Mercedes was better than Ferrari.
Ferrari's Kimi Raikkonen admitted that the worst competitor Mercedes was too tough in the Russian GP era.
However, there is no reason to panic at Ferrari camp, says an experienced driver.
They were just faster than us, but it's not a big deal.
Our car was the best in time for the whole weekend so far, but they were just too fast, they were driving for the fourth time, and his teammate Sebastian Vettel and the obviously out of the Mercedes race, Raikkonen said.
Ferrari had a hard time in the last race in Singapore.
The driver was asked what the real cause was of the sudden fall from the Mercedes ride.
They seem to be going faster than we are. It's as simple as that.
If I knew why, we'd probably be moving at the same speed as them.
But I don't know that any more than anyone else.
This is always a guess, and they seem to be ahead of us now.
Who knows why?
In the past, a rare sensitivity was seen in the future recording by Räikkönen for Sauber.
In the first season of the competition, Charles Leclerc, who replaced Ferrari, was seventh, and Marcus Ericsson also reached the final time trial.
The 10th best start for a Swedish drink in over three years.
And even though five drivers were left completely unattended in the second round, the result was delicious for Sauber.
And perhaps an encouragement to the Wrinkle for the future?
Yes, compared to where they were from the beginning, the step forward has been big.
Next year's a different story, so let's see, let's see.
That's it. Robert Helenius was the one who put Erka Teper in jail.
The fight between Robert Helenius and Erka Teper at Stuttgart last night went on a level playing field.
The German was the more initiative party in the ring, but he didn't get a good shot.
A much more visible Helenius controlled the match with his tough sets, which were well-placed.
The Finn was also clearly in better physical shape than Teper.
The solution finally came in the eighth inning when Helenius knocked out Teper with his left straight.
The impact was so severe that the conch in front of the home crowd didn't even try to get up from the carpet.
After the victory was assured, Helenius ventured quite modestly.
In the interview, he first praised the good mood of the audience and his opponent.
Then she switched to Finnish for a moment.
Thank you to all the viewers and to all the Finnish supporters.
We were brought in today.
Helenius was happy right after the game.
It was a huge win for Helenius' career.
"Maybe we could even get to the World Cup", Helenius told Evening News before the match.
But if we lost, it could have ended the whole boxing career.
Of course it's occurred to me.
There's no getting any younger here, 34-year-old Helenius admitted before Teper hit.
The number of victims of the Indonesian disaster could multiply
According to The Guardian, the country's vice president is urging the country to prepare for a clear rise in casualty numbers.
According to the country's vice president, Jusuf Kalla, the total death toll could reach thousands.
Difficult Circumstances
Rescuers are searching for trapped and dead people in Sulawes Island's worst-hit areas: the port city of Palun and its neighbouring Donggala.
So far, all the victims are Palus, and the situation with Donggala is still unclear.
Hundreds of people are missing and about 540 are seriously injured.
There are still people in the broken buildings that rescuers have not been able to get out.
For example, the Roa Roa hotel in Palusa is in a state of collapse.
Rescuers say they heard the cries of trapped people from the wreckage, but the lack of the equipment has delayed the rescue efforts.
Indonesian President Joko Widodo has ordered the army to rescue and disperse.
The army and its equipment are needed because in the disaster area, electricity and communications are cut off in many places.
Fuel supplies are also running out.
The contestant's hesitant response and long reflection caused a laugh
Billnäs Rökis is currently choosing the new Miss Finland.
In the interview round, every Miss finalist was asked a question.
The finalists were asking the question about the glass cover on the stage.
Especially finalist number six, Emilia Anttikosken, 23, received a lukewarm but benevolent laugh from the audience.
The question for the antiscope was sent through Facebook.
User Pirkko-Ella wanted to know what was the last book the Missfinalist ever read.
The antithesis was a good idea before it started to cast doubt.
Thank you for asking, Pirkko-Ella.
The last book I've read is...
The audience was in a state of shock, and Anttikoski continued to answer:
The last book I've read is...
I've read books in school!
It's probably something to do with economics.
So the last book I've read is an economics book, Anttikoski replied.
After his reply, Anttikoski received a loud applause from the audience, laughing.
An earlier Miss World tour drew attention to Anttikoski, who refused to pose in underwear for his principles.
Miss Finland 2018 will be crowned at 9pm, after the abdication of Miss Finland Michaela Söderholm.
A pig 's apple cider vinegar takes the tongue when it goes
This recipe is for those of you who have good, sour apples on your back, because the home apples are shockingly priced.
Perhaps you should buy a tree, although it seems that many people are already growing the tree.
This cake can also be made only from apples if you don't want to buy a peanut.
Of course, the taste is more versatile if the cake also has the head of the cake.
Cut the apples and peas and remove the seeds.
It was a fire.
You can melt in a boiler.
You can make eggs and sugar into a flour paste, then add cornmeal and salt.
Mix cornstarch, or corn, with bread dough and add them to the dough.
Add some almond flour and wheat flour, mix well.
Mount the loaf of bread with bread rolls, spread 2 tablespoons of sugar on the bottom of the loaf and spread the peel on top of the sugar.
Spit half the magic on the head pieces and the apple cider vines on the magic.
Spit the rest of it on the apple cider vines.
Cook in an oven at 180 degrees for about an hour until the surface is beautifully brown.
Let me cool off and then get off the catering line.
Don't cut the cake until it's cold.
The cake is fragile in structure and easily breaks down because of the gluten-free almond and corn flour in the cake.
The international crime fiction event will be held in Ruk in January.
In June, the first international literature festival focusing on Nordic crime fiction will be held in Ruku.
The programme of the Nordic Noir event consists of interviews, panel discussions and other literary programme numbers and jazz music.
The festival's literary guests include Jens Lapidus, a Swedish deck-book star, and the Swedish twin Jerker Eriksson and Håkan Axlander Sundquist, who are named after Erik Axel Sund.
In addition to the Swedish names, the event also features visitors from Iceland, Norway and Finland.
The Finnish writers are represented by Max Seeck.
According to the festival's organizers, the northern location, nature, dark seasons and the unique environment of Kuusumo provide a framework for a unique literary experience.
Status symbols didn 't attract friends .
What makes a person popular, charismatic, or admired?
Researchers at the University of Sydney have identified two slightly different types of "coolness": coolness of general appeal and coolness of opposites.
Attractive, cool people were described by researchers as having many of the social desirable traits: outward-looking, kind, fit, and competent.
Disagreeers, on the other hand, were characterized by distance, independence, rebellion, and anger.
They were thirsty for experience and paid little attention to outside reviews.
Both of these guys combined a good sense of self and a stable emotional life.
A hard role is not cool over a longer period: high status in adolescence may not lead to success later in life.
This is according to a 2014 study in the United States published in Child Development.
Young people who dated early, took tickets, joined handsome gangs, and sought the approval of others were at increased risk of drug use and crime as young adults.
In their human relationships, they fared less well than their peers, who were then unnoticed.
High-status luxury cars, signposts or watches do not make a person cool - or at least a truly attractive companion.
In a study published in the August issue of Social Psychological and Personality Science, most people were more willing to make friends with their regular marketing outfits than with those wearing their trademarks - even though most people preferred to wear a trademarks when they were dating.
If you're on a Greek holiday island, be careful!
There 's a terrible storm coming in . Weather warning screams red .
On the weekends, it may rain as much in southern Greece as it does in Finland on average in six months.
Zorbas storm is hitting Greece this weekend.
Beware of this if you are in the Peloponnese, Ionian Islands, Cyclades, or Crete.
The storm is very strong, so the Finnish Embassy in Athens will report it on its Facebook page.
The Greek Meteorological Service has issued a red weather warning to the regions, according to the Embassy.
The storm is also being reported on the Forecan blog.
It says the strongest storm can reach as high as 45 meters per second.
For comparison, the storm Kuisma, which hit Finland in the first week, blew at its strongest in the country at a rate of 31 meters per second.
However, according to the blog, the biggest concern of Hurricane Zorbas is not the wind, but heavy rains.
Over 300 millimeters of water could come to southern Greece over the weekend.
This is about half of Finland's annual rainfall.
The weather service Severe Weather Europa has shared a video of the storm's development on its Facebook page.
Hurricane Zorbas has caused flooding in Tunisia and Libya earlier this week.
Do you recognize the love island Finnish goose that men are dying of?
He's been featured in some confusing YouTube videos.
Few people know that in the Love Island series Finland, the beautiful Anku, who was killed by several men, also appears as a young woman in a strange YouTube video released in 2010.
In his videos, Anku advises the sculptors to make blackfish from an old economic paper roll.
The duck also shows its sympathetic style of how to use socks to grow a sickle with the right spikes.
Now we're going to grow Easter cereal, but we're going to do it a little bit surprisingly, and the Duck is hinting and presenting the saffron, the socks, and the raisin seeds that he makes into the silk.
You can watch the videos below or on Ank's YouTube channel here.
Valtteri Bottas shakes and pours his adrenaline in Sots, will he be Hamilton's assistant on Sunday?
Valtteri Bottas would shake a little more than ten minutes after his time in the Russian police station when he was in front of the media.
The round of the competition left behind Mercedes' number one Lewis Hamilton and was certainly a critical criticism of the Finnish side that came up this season.
Nice ride.
I don't know what happened to Lewis when he left the settlement round.
I feel good, I'm still shaking a little bit, Bottas figured it out.
I've only been to the pole once this year, in Austria (mid-summer), so it's been a while.
This track has been good to me before, and I've had good laps again.
So, it's not easy to get past the Sotchi track, so the start is a particularly big part.
And of course, Bottas was given the answer to the question of whether he'd be driving tomorrow to win or whether he'd be in the lead up to Hamilton's upcoming world title.
I'm definitely starting the race trying to win.
When you leave the pole, there can be no other goal, Bottas said.
But as a team, we're fighting for both championships.
Lewis's lead in Sebastian Vettel is pretty big and the difference between me and him is pretty big, so you have to keep that in mind.
Let's see what happens, but Bottas is complete.
Hamilton was really happy with the success of the Bocs after the race, and the Mercedes-Benz bulldozer Toto Wolff was also happy to see it.
Lewis had a plan to beat Valtter, but he couldn't make it in the sixth.
Valtteri knows he has to pull himself together to beat Lewis.
And he was so charged, the adrenaline rushed out of his ear, Wolff burst.
When asked if the pitch would allow Bottas and Hamilton to drive steadily, Wolff replied by dodging.
We'll talk about it tomorrow morning, see how the race goes.
The rally driver Erno Kinnunen won the Finnish championship
The SM series of rally cars ended in a rare way.
Hardly ever before have the brothers become Finnish champions at the same time.
Now, in the final round of the Tour and Salon, the two Dutch drivers Eerik and Henrik Pietarinen won the SM1 and Henrik SM2 classes.
The winning driver Erno Kinnunen secured the best result of his career when he won the Finnish championship in the SM4 two-seater class.
Kinnunen and Ville Mäkelä, a Honda Civic competitor, started the market competition on the basis of a clear principle: placing in the top group would guarantee the SM-type title.
On Friday night, in the dark, the two were forced to give a leveling when some of the extra lights cheated on another special experiment.
I was pretty shocked to see the third one.
You know, in a situation like this, it's not a good idea to wear a bra.
On Saturday, the second series was only followed by Jussi Tepo's speed, Kinnunen said.
Syria demands that the United States, France and Turkey withdraw their troops
The Syrian Foreign Minister is demanding that the United States, France and Turkey withdraw their troops from Syria.
Speaking at the UN General Assembly on Saturday, Foreign Minister Walid Muallem said foreign troops must leave Syria immediately and unconditionally.
Muallem said foreign forces were in Syria fighting terrorism and that the war against terrorists was "almost over".
In his UN address, Muallem also urged Syrian refugees to return home.
But the war, which has lasted seven years, does not seem to be over.
More than 360,000 people have died in the war.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel said on Friday that a meeting in Syria was planned for October, which she added would include the presidents of France, Russia and Turkey.
Not exactly the Super Bowl, but tens of millions of Americans watched the Supreme Court Justice drama on TV.
Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and her harassment accuser, Professor Christine Blasey Ford, had an exceptional crowd at the sides of the aisle.
The full-length drama of the Supreme Court's appointment of judges in the United States received at least 20 million viewers on television on Thursday.
At the time, Donald Trump's nominee Kavanaugh and his harassment accuser, California professor Blasey Ford, were standing before the Senate Judiciary Committee to tell their story.
Initial results showed that a total of 20.4 million viewers were watching the hearings on six main channels: ABC, CBS, CNN, FOX News, MSNBC and NBC.
In addition to their online consultations, several millions more followed.
NBC reported that the live stream was followed by 6.8 million people and CNN reported that it set a record for the year with 8.2 million live streams.
CNN's number is going to rise to over 10 million if you count the number of people who watched the show on YouTube and Facebook.
Fox News Digital also got 8.0 million hits.
Digital launches are channels' own, TV viewing figures are from research and data analytics company Nielsen.
Nielsen will publish the final readings on Monday, but they're a mess anyway.
Rarely exceeds 20 million
Over 20 million viewers in the United States typically only watch sports events, the major Oscars and Grammy Awards in the entertainment world, and occasional political events such as presidential speeches and 2016 presidential debates.
The most watched program of the year in the United States, the NFL's Super Bowl, is a long way off.
This year, the Super Bowl has gathered 103 million people on NBC.
Last year, Nielsen said that Trump's first speech to Congress was watched by nearly 48 million people and 30 million people at his inauguration.
The High Point
The appointment of a Supreme Court justice is a very important matter in the United States because the office is life-long.
Trump was already able to appoint a new judge when Antonin Scalia died in early 2016, and Republicans were able to prevent then-President Barack Obama from appointing a successor.
The second seat was opened when Judge Anthony Kennedy, 81, announced he would retire this year.
Kennedy was nominated by Republican President Ronald Reagan, but on many issues he was the so-called "white language" whose voice could decide the position of the nine-judge panel.
She was a supporter of abortion rights and the rights of sexual minorities and, for example, in 2015, she voted to allow same-sex couples to marry throughout the federal state.
Kavanaugh is much more conservative in his approach.
His choice of the Supreme Court could lock the conservative wing of the court for decades.
Children have a right to information from their parents
Only parents of children under 10 years of age can see their children's health information on Kanta.
It's a big problem, it's wrong, and it's weird.
Of course, the situation at the beginning of the Kanta service was even more worrying: parents could not even see the health information or recipes of the children.
The provisional characterisation correction for the situation was made in autumn 2016 for children under 10 years of age.
Since then, we've been promised to make adjustments, but it's taken us an amazing amount of time to make adjustments.
Now, the repair is authorized in 2020.
Since the problem is clear, changing the legal basis should not have been more than a matter of public outcry.
Then the artist's understanding is that when you press the button, when you hold the wire, you open it.
Of course, a child can show his or her parents information if he or she has a bank account or an official ID card.
But how many 10-year-olds have it?
I mean, I'm a credit card guy, and I don't even get a 10-year-old's bank card.
So basically, no one can see the information of a fourth grader in primary school except by asking for it in print.
It's not so much about the rights of parents as it is about the rights of children.
It is extremely important for the child's care that parents are involved.
The right to privacy of teenagers is of course a matter of concern.
Children may also have family situations where they cannot talk freely about everything.
They are often related to sexual health, for which free care is a deeply important human right.
In the United States, the FBI began investigating Kavanaugh's allegations of harassment.
According to the U.S. media, the FBI is investigating at least two women's allegations of harassment.
One of the women was on the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing earlier this week.
Kavanaugh has denied the allegations of sexual harassment during her studies.
President Donald Trump has ordered the FBI to investigate the allegations at the request of the Senate Judiciary Committee.
The investigation cannot take more than a week.
According to the Washington Post, this is a limited investigation, and it's not necessarily going to be public.
A man threatened to kill police officers at a police station in Kajan
The film-filled bombardier continued to bottle up even in the chambers.
Police say they put the man in a police prison to "calm down".
Police were threatened by a suspected assailant on Saturday night in Kajan.
The authorities are reporting a case that began when a fair 30-year-old man was fiercely challenging a dispute in a downtown mall.
First, he assaulted another customer inside the grocery store.
This is what got me out of the restaurant.
A fighter outside attacked another man, knocking him down.
When the third party tried to intervene, he hit her too.
The three-way arrest led to the police being called.
The police arrested the man and took Kajan to the police station, police say.
The suspect continued to behave aggressively at the police station.
He kicked another cop in the leg.
He threatened to kill and assault the police.
Police say they took the man to the police station to "calm down".
The man is charged with three counts of assault and one count of violent resistance to public office.
Relief agencies prepare to start work in Sulawes, Indonesia - "Clean water is the most urgent thing"
UNICEF and other international aid organizations are ready to help in Sulawes, Indonesia, UNICEF chief of information Kirsi Haru said.
Local authorities are leading the rescue effort, but the need for additional assistance is already apparent at this stage.
UNICEF operates in almost all countries, and we also have long-term programmes in Indonesia.
In addition to normal operations, UNICEF is always fully prepared for emergency response, Haru says.
The first task now is to find the people in the ruins, both the survivors and the dead.
Rescue operations are underway in Sulawes, please, but the situation is more ambiguous in the Donggala area, slightly further north.
There are still places where the connections don't work.
"The relief efforts are difficult because the roads are also crossed", says Haru.
The buildings in Sulawes are often lightweight, so the earthquake and tsunami damage is massive.
Once the survivors are found, they need shelter. First, tents, for example. And clean water.
Clean water is the most urgent emergency.
The first is that people are often able to supply water purification tablets, which UNICEF also has in stock.
Water systems are to be repaired as soon as possible, but in the event of an emergency, water is first transported, for example by truck.
In times of crisis, many children are forced to lose their parents.
Family search and family reunification is part of the mission of UNICEF.
Food aid is provided by the World Food Programme (WFP), part of the United Nations.
Initial emergency aid shall be used from previously raised funds.
However, UNICEF has already started a fundraiser to help victims of the Indonesian earthquake and tsunami, among other things.
Billionaire Elon Musk is ending his tenure as Tesla's chairman of the board of directors on a $20 million fine for tweeting
Elon Musk, founder of the spacecraft and electric car companies, is avoiding fraud charges by signing a deal with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
Billionaire Elon Musk is resigning as chairman of the board of Tesla's electric car company and has agreed to $20 million in fines.
Mr. Musk is stepping down as part of a deal he made with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
If Musk agrees, he'll avoid the charges of fraud.
The SEC threatened Musk with securities fraud over tweets he sent in August.
In those letters, Musk wrote that he was preparing to take Tesla out of the stock market, which led to a rapid rise in the company's stock price.
Under the terms of the agreement, Musk will not be allowed to serve as Tesla's chairman of the board for three years.
In addition, Tesla must appoint a new "independent member" to its board and take two "independent directors" to its board.
Tesla must also set up a committee to monitor Musk's communications.
Musk can still be Tesla's CEO.
In addition to Musk's personal fines of $20 million, Tesla will also have to pay $20 million in fines to the financial supervisor.
The tweets led investors astray
According to the SEC, Musk's tweets led investors and Tesla shareholders into a false sense of security.
Musk claimed that he had secured funding to buy Tesla back from the stock exchange as a private equity firm.
According to the billionaire's tweets, the company would have been bought off the stock exchange for $420.
Tesla's stock price rose more than 10 percent in 24 hours after the tweets, but fell later.
The SEC said Musk's claims were groundless.
The supervisor said that he had not actually negotiated his claim of funding.
He had also not discussed withdrawals from the stock exchange with any other management or board of directors.
On Friday this week, the stock price dropped 14 percent when the SEC filed a fraud charge.
The new arrangement is expected to reinforce the company's course.
The final judgment is not a cause.
Of course, the bells of the Church of the Judgment don't ring when the wise men don't move.
It's a technical flaw.
The bell tower of the Helsinki Cathedral has stopped.
The wise men point to 12:00.
It's like a mid-range horror movie, when the crypt of the church is a monastery and the monks are playing themselves.
Of course, this is not the case. The clock has stopped for a technical reason: it is broken.
The repairman has been to see it, but some parts have broken down and a new part is expected, says Eveliina James.
At the same time, James confirms the fact already mentioned on the Church in Helsinki's Twitter account.
The account states that the final judgment is not the reason for the clock to stop.
James says the church clocks don't ring because of a mistake.
