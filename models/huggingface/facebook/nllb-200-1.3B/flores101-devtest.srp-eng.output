Besides confirming that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, which is already a widely accepted theory, this also gives us details that fossils cannot in principle, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists say that the feathers of these animals were either a dull brown color on the top and pale or cardenoid color on the undersides.
This discovery also provides insight into the evolution of feathers in birds.
Since the feathers of dinosaurs do not have a well-developed axis, called the rachis, but have other features of feathers  spines and prickles  researchers have concluded that the rachis probably originated in a later evolutionary development relative to these other features.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used for flight but for temperature regulation and display. The researchers' view is that, although the tail is that of a young dinosaur, the specimen suggests that it is the feathers of an adult individual, not a young.
The researchers noted that although this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample shows the feathers of an adult individual, not the feathers of a bird.
A car bomb that exploded yesterday morning at a police headquarters in Gaziantep, Turkey, killed two police officers and injured more than 20 others.

The work done is mostly theoretical in nature, but the program is written to simulate observations of the Sagittarius galaxy.
The effect the team was looking for would be tidal forces between the dark matter of the galaxy and the dark matter of the Milky Way.
By the same principle that the Moon pulls the Earth, causing tides and eddies, the Milky Way exerts a force on the Sagittarius galaxy.
Scientists have concluded that dark matter affects other dark matter just as ordinary matter does.
According to this theory, most of the dark matter around a galaxy is contained in a halo, and it is made up of a multitude of tiny particles.

In France, voting is traditionally very simple in terms of technology: voters stand alone in a booth and put a printed ballot with the chosen candidate marked in an envelope.
Once the officials confirm the voter's identity, he or she inserts an envelope into the ballot box and signs the ballot.
The French electoral law codifies the protocol very strictly.
Since 1988, ballot boxes have had to be transparent so that voters and observers can see that there are no envelopes at the beginning of voting and that no envelopes are added except those of duly registered and authorized voters.
Candidates can send representatives to attend each part of the process.

He was initially hospitalized at James Padgett Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was immediately transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
A woman has since been charged in Edinburgh Sheriff's Court with the murder of her son.
She is in custody awaiting indictment and trial, but any eyewitness evidence may be compromised given that her image has been published in many media.
This is common practice elsewhere in the UK, but the Scottish legal system works differently and the courts consider the publication of photographs to be potentially harmful.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee observed: "It seems that journalists are walking a dangerous line if they publish pictures of suspects or something else".
The Scottish Public Prosecutor's Office, which has general jurisdiction over prosecutions, told reporters that there would be no further comment until at least the indictment is filed.
According to leaked information, the document will relate to the border dispute, which Palestine wants to be based on the pre-1967 Six-Day War borders.
Other topics discussed reportedly included the future status of Jerusalem, which is a world for both nations, and the issue of the Jordan Valley.
Israel demands a continuous military presence in the valley for ten years after the signing of the agreement, while the Palestinian authorities agree that the presence exists for only five years.
Shooters in a supplemental pest control operation were to be under the strict supervision of the ranger, provided that the operation was monitored and its effectiveness assessed.
Thanks to a partnership between the NPWS and a corporation called the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW), qualified volunteers have been hired as part of the Sporting Shooters Association's hunting program.
According to Mike Ohlin, acting director of parks and heritage conservation at the NPWS, the four shooters selected for the first shooting operation received comprehensive safety instructions and training.
The new nine-member Electoral Commission (CEP) was sworn in yesterday under Martelli.
It is Martelli's fifth election commission in four years.
Last month, a presidential commission recommended the previous resignation of CEP as part of a package of measures to kick-start the country towards new elections.
This commission was Martelli's response to widespread anti-regime protests that began in October.
Sometimes violent protests have been caused by non-performance of elections, some of which have been on the agenda since 2011.
About 60 cases of overheating of faulty iPod devices were reported, resulting in a total of six fires, but also minor burns in four persons.
The Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade, and Industry said it was aware of 27 accidents involving these devices.
Last week, METI reported that Apple had notified it of 34 additional overheating incidents, which the company called "minor".
The ministry responded by calling Epps' delay in reporting "really regrettable".
The earthquake hit Mariana at 07:19 local time (9:19 pm GMT on Friday).
The Northern Mariana Islands Emergency Management Office said no damage was reported in the country.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also stated that there was no indication of a tsunami.
A former Filipino policeman held tourists hostage in Hong Kong by hijacking their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Ronaldo Mendoza fired his M16 rifle at tourists.
Several hostages have been rescued and at least six have so far been confirmed dead.
Six hostages, including children and the elderly, were released earlier, as were Filipino photographers.
The photographers later took the place of an elderly lady who needed a toilet.
Following in his father's footsteps, Liggins began to build a career in medicine.
He trained as a midwife and began working at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
While working at the hospital, Liggins began to investigate preterm births in his spare time.
His research showed that hormone administration would speed up fetal lung maturation.
Xinhua reported that government investigators on Wednesday found two black boxes, which contained flight records.
Fellow wrestlers also paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said, "The Moon was the first queen of extremes. My first manager. The Moon passed in the night for two months.
Dustin Goldast Runnels commented: "The moon was as strange as I was...maybe even more...I love her and will miss her...I hope she's in a better place".
Of 1,400 people polled before the 2010 federal election, those opposed to Australia becoming a republic rose by 8 percent since 2008.
Acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard insisted during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed Australia should become a republic at the end of Elizabeth II's reign.
Thirty-four percent of those polled share this view and want Queen Elizabeth II to be the last Australian monarch.
In the extreme survey, 29 percent of respondents believe that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent believe that Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist was supposed to swim the 100 and 200-meter freestyle in three relay events at the Commonwealth Games, but his complaints have cast doubt on his fitness.
He was unable to take the pain medication he needed because it was banned at the Olympics.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number on January 25.
Several people confirmed the discovery using various hardware and software by early February, and it was announced on Tuesday.
Comets may have been the source of water that reached the Earth along with organic matter that can form proteins and enable life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form, especially how the Earth formed, since comets have been colliding with the Earth since ancient times.
Cuomo, 53, became governor earlier this year and signed a bill last month legalizing same-sex marriage.
He said that the rumors were "political chatter and nonsense".
There is talk in the public that he will run for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that the FAA claims will allow aircraft to fly shorter routes, and save millions of gallons of fuel each year, as well as reduce carbon dioxide emissions.
It uses satellite technology, as opposed to earlier technologies based on ground-based radar, to enable air traffic controllers to determine the aircraft's position more accurately and to provide pilots with more accurate information.
No additional transportation placed on overhead trains will stop at Wembley, and parking and parking facilities are not available above ground.
Fear of a lack of transportation raised the possibility that the game would have to be played behind closed doors without a team fan.
Research published Thursday in the journal Science reports the creation of a new bird species in the Ecuadorian Galapagos Islands.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that the new species evolved over only two generations, although this process is believed to take much longer, due to mating between the endemic Darwin's frog, Geospiza fortes, and the domesticated cactus frog, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be shaped into all kinds of shapes.
It can be processed into a thin wire, which can be twisted or braided.
It can be made in a very thin form, as well as glued to some other metal. It can be so thin that it is sometimes used to decorate pictures in books known as "illustrated (illuminated) manuscripts".
You can make an indicator using red cabbage juice.
Cabbage juice changes color depending on whether the chemical is acidic or alkaline.
The pH level indicates the amount of hydrogen ion (H in pH) in the test chemical.
Hydrogen ions are protons with electrons removed (since hydrogen atoms consist of one proton and one electron).
Mix the two dry powders together and then squeeze them into the ball with your clean, wet hands.
The moisture on your hands will react with the outer layers, causing a strange sensation and forming a kind of wrap.
The cities of Harapa and Mohenjo-daro had toilet cups in almost every home, which were connected to a sophisticated sewer system.
Remains of a sewer system have been found in houses in the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini in Greece.
In ancient Egypt, Persia, and China, toilets were once part of public baths, where men and women shared the same social environment.
When you call someone thousands of miles away, you're using a satellite.
A satellite in space receives a call and then returns it down almost instantaneously.
Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere reflects some of the light and images.
Sending a satellite or telescope into space requires a huge rocket, over 100 feet high.
The wheel changed the world in incredible ways. The greatest thing the wheel has done for us is that it has made transportation much easier and faster.
This brought us trains, cars, and many other means of transportation.
Below them are medium-sized cats that eat medium-sized prey, from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
Finally, there are many small cats (including free-ranging pets) that eat far more small prey such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret to their success is the concept of an ecological niche, a special job that each cat does and that prevents it from competing with others.
Lions are the most sociable of cats, living in large groups known as swarms.
Herds consist of one to three adult males in a litter, compared with up to thirty females and young.
The women are usually closely related, forming a large family of sisters and daughters.
Lion troopers behave similarly to wolf or dog troops, animals that are surprisingly similar in behavior to lions (but not to other big cats), and are also very deadly to their prey.
A versatile athlete, the tiger can climb a tree (though not well), swim, jump great distances, and pull with five times the force of a strong man.
The tiger is in the same group (genus Panthera) as the lion, leopard, and jaguar.
The tiger's roar is not like the loud roar of a lion, but rather like a sentence full of sharp, shouted words.
They will catch monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds if they can, and almost all the animals they hunt are much smaller than themselves.
Scientists think that ocelots track and search for prey by smell, by sniffing at the place on the ground where they have been.
They can see very well in the dark with the aid of night vision, and they move very subtly.
When a small group of organisms (a small population) separates from the main population from which it originated (for example, if they migrate across a mountain range or a river or if they migrate to a new island so that they cannot easily return) they will often find themselves in an environment different from the one they were in before.
This new environment has different resources and different competitors, so the new population will have to have different characteristics or adapt to be a stronger competitor than was previously needed.
The original population has not changed a bit, and they still need the same adaptations as before.
Over time, as a new population begins to adapt to its new environment, it becomes less and less like another population.
Eventually, after several thousand or even millions of years, two populations will look so different that they can no longer be called the same species.
This process is called speciation, which simply means the creation of new species.
Plants make the oxygen that humans breathe, and they take in the carbon dioxide that humans breathe in (that is, exhale).
Plants make their food from the sun by photosynthesis, and they also provide us with coolness.
We make our houses out of plants, we make our clothes out of plants, and we eat most of our food from plants.
The Mosaurus was the ultimate predator of its time, and they feared nothing but other Mosaurus.
His long jaws were lined with more than 70 teeth, razor-sharp, along with an additional set of teeth on a hard jaw, meaning that nothing in his path could escape.
We cannot say for sure, but it may have had a hand-tied tongue, and its diet included turtles, large fish, and other mosasaurs, and it may even have been a cannibal.
It also attacked anything that entered the water; even a giant dinosaur like the T-Rex would not be equal to it.
Although most of their food would be familiar to us, the Romans had some strange or unusual things to feast on, including wild boars, peacocks, snails, and a kind of puffed rodent.
Another difference was that while poor men and women ate their food sitting on chairs, the rich preferred to have banquets where they would lie on their sides while eating their meals.
Ancient Roman meals could not have contained the foods that came to Europe from the Americas or Asia in later centuries.
For example, they had no corn, no tomatoes, no potatoes, no cocoa, and no ancient Roman had ever tasted mustard.
The Babylonians built a primary temple for each of their gods, which was considered to be the house of that god.
People sacrificed to the gods, and priests would try to please the gods through ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open courtyard in front of the temple and an inner sanctuary that was open only to priests.
At one time, special pyramid-shaped towers, called ziggurats, were built to be part of temples.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary for the god.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, home was not so important.
Most of the daily life of a Hebrew family took place outdoors.
Women cooked in the yard; shops were just open shelves overlooking the street.
There were no large forests in the land of Canaan, so timber was extremely expensive.
In Norse sagas, Eric the Red is said to have been banished from Iceland for murder, and when he traveled further west, he found Greenland and named it Greenland.
But despite its discovery, the Eskimo tribes were already living there at the time.
Although each country was Scandinavian, there were numerous differences among the peoples, kings, customs, and histories of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you have seen the film National Treasure, you may think that a treasure map is drawn against the background of the Declaration of Independence.
Although the document has a note on the back, it is not a treasure map.
The back of the Declaration of Independence had the words  The original Declaration of Independence of July 4, 1776. The text appears at the bottom of the document, upside down.
Although no one knows for sure who wrote it, it is known that somewhere in its early days this large parchment document (measuring 293⁄4 by 241⁄2 inches) was difficult to store.
Well, most likely the label was added purely as a mark.
The D-Day landings and the battles that followed liberated northern France, but the south was still not free.
It was led by the French of the Vichy era, who had made peace with Germany in 1940 and allied themselves with it rather than fighting against it.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies invaded southern France, the invasion being called Operation Dragon.
In just two weeks, the Americans and Free French forces had liberated southern France and were on their way to Germany.
A civilization is a unique culture that is significantly shared by a large group of people who live and work in cooperation, i.e. society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin civilis, meaning civil, and is related to the Latin civis, meaning citizen, and civitas, meaning city or city-state, which also defines the size of a community.
Civilized culture involves the transmission of knowledge over several generations, a lasting cultural imprint, and an orderly spread.
Minor cultures usually disappear without leaving any relevant historical evidence, and so are often not recognized as true civilizations.
During the War of Independence, thirteen states first formed a weak central government - with Congress as the sole component - under the Treaty of Confederation.
Congress had no power to impose taxes, and since there was no national executive or judicial power, it relied on state authorities, which were often ineffective in enforcing all their legal documents.
Nor did he have any right to overturn tax laws and tariffs between states.
It required unanimous approval from all states before members could change, and states so easily understood central government that their representatives were often absent from meetings.
The Italian national football team, along with the German national football team, was the second most successful team in the world and were the winners of the 2006 World Cup.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, wrestling, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey and Formula 1 racing.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern regions, and Italians compete in international games or Olympic events.
Japan is made up of nearly 7,000 islands (the largest of which is Honshu), making Japan the 7th largest island in the world!
Because of the group of islands that Japan has, Japan is often referred to in geographical descriptions as the archipel.
Taiwan dates back to the 15th century, when European sailors passing by recorded the island's name as ilja formosa, or beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan, beginning a transformation of Aboriginal grain-producing practices, and employing Chinese workers to work on its rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, Qing Dynasty forces (1644-1912) took control of the western and northern coastal parts of Taiwan, and declared Taiwan a Qing province of the Empire in 1885.
After defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-95), the Qing government signed the Shimonoseki Treaty in 1895, which gave Japan sovereignty over Taiwan, which it ruled until 1945.
Machu Picchu is made up of three main buildings, namely the Intihua-Tana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Three-Window Room.
Most of the buildings on the edges of the complex have been reconstructed to give tourists a better idea of how they originally looked.
By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and the restoration continues to this day.
For example, the most common still image photography format in the world is 35 mm, which was the dominant film size at the end of the analog film era.
It is still produced today, but more importantly, its width-to-height ratio has inherited the image sensor formats of digital cameras.
The 35 mm format is actually, somewhat confusingly, 36 mm wide, and 24 mm high.
The dimension ratio of this format is assumed to be 3:2 (divided by 12 to obtain the simplest ratio in the form of an integer).
Many common formats (say the APS family of formats) are equal to or nearly this size.
The rule of thirds that is often abused and often ridiculed is a simple instruction that creates dynamics while maintaining a measure of order in the picture.
It states that the most striking place for the main subject is at the intersection of the lines that vertically and horizontally divide the image into thirds (see example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become rich and powerful, began to be monitored.
For thousands of years, Christianity has connected the European powers, despite differences in language and customs.
With its inexhaustible power, it has affected everyone, from kings to commoners.
One of the main Christian principles is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty and that the monetary funds of the church exist for that very reason.
The central authority of the church has been in Rome for over a thousand years, and this concentration of power and money has led many to question whether this principle is being fulfilled.
Immediately after the outbreak of hostilities, Britain began a naval blockade of Germany.
The strategy proved effective, as it cut off the flow of key military and civilian supplies, although this blockade violated generally accepted international law codified in several international treaties over the past two centuries.
Britain mined international waters to prevent any ships from entering entire parts of the ocean, thus endangering even neutral ships.
Since the responses to this tactic were limited, Germany expected a similar response to its policy of unrestricted submarine warfare.
During the 1920's, pacifism and isolationism dominated the attitudes of most citizens and nations.
After seeing the horrors and atrocities of World War I, the nations wanted to avoid such a situation in the future.
To accept a job with the Edison Company in New York, Tesla moved to the United States in 1884.
He arrived in the United States with 4 cents in his pocket, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Bachelor (his boss at his previous job) intended for Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of representing different time periods; each period of China or each family that was in power represented a distinct dynasty.
The most famous of all was the Three Kingdoms era, which lasted for sixty years between the Han and Yin dynasties.
During this period, fierce warfare was taking place among many nobles vying for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms were one of the bloodiest periods in ancient Chinese history, with thousands of people dying in the struggle for the throne in the huge palace of Si'an.
There are many social and political outcomes such as the use of the metric system, the shift from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism, and the belief that the state belongs to the people, not to a single ruler.
Also after the revolution the occupation was open to all men who applied, allowing the most ambitious and successful to succeed.
The same is true of the military, for instead of being class-based, ranks are now based on caliber.
The French Revolution also inspired many oppressed working-class people in other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was deeply interested in issues that were outside of his ordinary life, and he often went to meditate in the cave that became known as Hira on Mount Nur (Light).
The cave itself, which has survived various times, gives a very clear picture of Muhammad's spiritual inclinations.
Located on top of one of the mountains north of Mecca, the cave is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, it is difficult to find, even if one knows it exists.
Nothing is visible except the clear, beautiful skies and the numerous surrounding mountains.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the seven wonders of the world still standing.
The Great Pyramid, built by the Egyptians in the third century B.C.E., is one of a number of large pyramidal structures that honor the late pharaoh.
The Giza Necropolis, or Giza Necropolis, in Egypt's Valley of the Dead, consists of several pyramids (the Great Pyramid being the largest), several small tombs, several temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was created in honor of the Pharaoh Cheops, and many smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built in honor of Cheops' wives and family members.
The uz arch looks like a B, and the iz arch looks like a spanner or a square that is missing the bottom side.
 up means that you should start at the top and press the pulley, while  down means that you start from the frog (the place where your hand holds the pulley) and pull the pulley.
Raising the hips usually produces a quieter sound, while lowering the hips produces a louder and more assertive sound.
Feel free to write your notes in pencil, but remember that the printed notes of the guillotine are present for musical reasons, and they should usually be respected.
The frightened King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette and their two young children (11 year old Marie-Thérèse and four year old Louis-Charles), as well as the king's sister, Madame Elizabeth, were forced to retreat to Paris from Versailles on October 6, 1789, at the instigation of a mob of women from the market.
They traveled back to Paris in a carriage, surrounded by a mob of people who shouted and shouted threats against the king and queen.
The ruler ordered the king and queen to open the carriage windows wide.
At one point, a member of the procession waved the head of a royal guard killed at Versailles before the terrified queen.
The war costs of American imperialism in conquering the Philippines were paid by the citizens of the Philippines themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the U.S. colonial regime in order to meet the bulk of the costs and interest on the securities that were circulated on behalf of the Philippine government through Wall Street banks.
Of course, the enormous profits derived from the long-term exploitation of the Filipino people were the main gain of American imperialism.
To understand the Templars, one must also understand the context that prompted the creation of the order.
The time in which these events took place is often called the Late Middle Ages, a period of European history in the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000-1300 C.E.).
The height of the Middle Ages was preceded by the Working Middle Ages, followed by the Late Middle Ages, which officially ended around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term encompassing a wide range of ideas in practice, from technological pressure or technological imperative to the strict sense that human destiny is guided by fundamental logic related to scientific laws and their manifestations in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism have two general ideas: that technological development itself is going by a path that is beyond cultural and political influences and that in turn technology has its "effects" on societies that are inherent, rather than socially conditioned.
For example, it might be said that the motor vehicle necessarily leads to the development of roads.
Yet, the national road network is not economically viable for just a few cars, so new production methods have been developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
Massive car ownership also leads to an increased incidence of road accidents, leading to the invention of new healthcare techniques to repair damaged bodies.
Romanticism contained a considerable dose of cultural determinism, drawn from writers such as Goethe, Ficht and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography shaped individuals, and over time customs and cultures associated with that geography would emerge, and these, in keeping with the place of society, were superior to arbitrarily imposed laws.
Just as Paris is known as the fashion capital of the modern world, so Constantinople is considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its reputation as an epicenter of luxury began around 400 and lasted until about 1100.
Its status declined during the twelfth century, largely due to the fact that the Crusaders returned, bringing gifts, such as silk and spices, that were more valuable than those offered by the Byzantine markets.
It was at this time that the title of fashion capital was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style reached its peak between the 10th-11th and 14th centuries.
At first, clothing was strongly influenced by Byzantine culture in the east.
However, because of slow communication channels, Western styles may be some 25 to 30 years behind.
By the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe was developing its own style, and one of the greatest inventions of the Crusades was the use of buttons to fasten clothes.
Consumer agriculture is agriculture that is conducted to produce enough food just for the needs of the farmer and his/her family.
Consumer agriculture is a simple, often organic, system that uses stored seeds, native to a given ecoregion in combination with crop rotation and other relatively simple techniques to increase yields.
Historically, most farmers have been self-employed, and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together like-minded people who feel left out by social norms and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures may be distinct because of age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender of members.
The features that define a subculture as unique may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or a combination of factors.
Members of a subculture often denote their membership through distinctive and symbolic uses of style, which include fashion, mannerism, and slang.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to refer to some sad cases of children who, because of neglect, accident, or physical abuse, were not socialized by adults as they grew up.
Some wild children have been imprisoned by humans (usually their own parents); in some cases, this abandonment occurs because the parents refuse to accept the serious intellectual and physical shortcomings of the child.
Wild children may have experienced severe childhood abuse or trauma before they were abandoned or fled.
Others are said to have been raised by animals; others are said to have lived in the wild.
When fully raised by nonhuman animals, wild children show behavior (within physical limits) almost entirely similar to that of the animals that cared for them, such as their fear or indifference to humans.
While project-based learning should make learning easier and more interesting, learning through the skala system is a step forward.
Metacognitive support is not a learning method, but rather a support that provides support to individuals, with help going through a new learning experience, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
A dummy can be both virtual and real, in other words, the teacher is actually a kind of dummy, but so is the little human-builder in Microsoft Office.
Virtual assistants are an integral part of the software and need to review, encourage, and explain procedures that might be too complicated for students to perform on their own.
Children are placed in foster care for a variety of reasons, ranging from neglect to abuse and even blackmail.
No child should ever grow up in an environment that is not nurturing, caring, and educational, but it is happening.
We consider the foster system a safe haven for these children.
Our foster-family system should provide a secure home, caring caregivers, continuing education, and reliable health care.
The children's family accommodation should provide all the necessities that were lacking in the homes from which they were previously taken.
The Internet combines elements of both mass and interpersonal communication.
The unique features of the Internet have led to additional dimensions in terms of use and access to pleasure.
For example, learning and socializing are cited as important purposes of Internet use (James et al., 1995).
Amy and McCord (1998) identified "personal engagement" and "maintained connections" as new motivational aspects when studying audience reactions to websites.
The use of video recording has led to significant discoveries in the interpretation of micro-expressions, facial movements that last for several milliseconds.
It is specifically claimed that if you correctly interpret microexpressions, you can tell if a person is lying.
In his work The President's Speech, Oliver Sacks pointed out that people who are unable to understand speech because of brain damage can still accurately judge honesty.
He even suggests that such abilities to understand human behavior may be present in animals such as domestic dogs.
Research in the 20th century has shown that there are two forms of genetic variation: hidden and unseen.
Mutation adds a new genetic variation, and selection is the removal from the background of the expressed variation.
Segregation and recombination affect the continuous mixing of variations between the two funds in each generation.
In the savanna, a primate with a digestive tract similar to that of a human has difficulty satisfying its need for amino acids from available plant sources.
Even if this is not done, serious consequences can result: increased depression, malnutrition, and eventually death.
The most accessible plant resources were the proteins available in leaves and sponges, but primates like us have a hard time cheating them if they are not cooked.
In contrast, animal foods (ants, termites, eggs) are not only easily digestible but also provide a high amount of protein, which contains all the essential amino acids.
All things considered, it should come as no surprise if our ancestors solved their "protein problem" in much the same way as chimpanzees do in the savannah today.
Sleep interruption is the process of deliberately waking up during your normal sleep period and falling asleep shortly thereafter (10-60 minutes).
This can easily be accomplished with a relatively quiet alarm that would bring you to a state of consciousness without waking you up completely.
If you reset the clock while you sleep, you can put it on the other side of the room, which will force you to get out of bed and turn it off.
Other biorhythm-based options include drinking plenty of fluids (especially water or tea, a well-known diuretic) before bed, which forces the man to get up to urinate.
The amount of inner peace a person possesses is inversely proportional to the amount of tension in that person's body and spirit.
The lower the tension, the more positive the life force. Each person has the potential to find absolute peace and quiet.
The only thing standing in the way of enlightenment is our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but it has been expanded by the Mahayana path of love and many techniques of Indian yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple, consisting of a bundle of yoga, meditation, and the path of all-embracing love.
With kundalini yoga, kundalini energy (enlightenment energy) is awakened through yoga poses, breathing exercises, mantras and visualization.
The central focus of Tibetan meditation is the deity Yoga. By visualizing the various deities, energy channels are cleared, chakras are activated, and enlightened consciousness is created.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, which led to cooperation between the USSR and the United States. At the end of the war, conflicts of systems, processes, and cultures led to the two countries' falling out.
Two years after the war ended, the former allies were now enemies, and the Cold War began.
It was planned to last 40 years, and the fight would be real, through conflicts of smaller countries that represent the interests of larger military forces, on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, in Cuba, and in many other places.
By September 17, 1939, the Polish defences were already broken, and the only hope was to withdraw and reorganize along the Romanian bridgehead.
However, these plans became obsolete almost overnight, as over 800,000 soldiers from the Soviet Union's Red Army entered and created the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts after occupying eastern areas of Poland in violation of the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other international agreements, both bilateral and multilateral.
Trans-oceanic shipping is arguably the most efficient way to move large numbers of people and large quantities of goods across the ocean.
The Navy's job has traditionally been to ensure that your country maintains its ability to transport people and goods, while also preventing the enemy from transporting their own people and goods.
One of the most notable, recent examples of this was the North Atlantic campaign of World War II, in which the Americans tried to move men and weapons across the Atlantic to help Britain.
At the same time, the German navy, using mostly submarines, tried to stop this traffic.
Had the Allies failed, Germany would probably have been able to conquer Britain as it did the rest of Europe.
Goats seem to have been first domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to preserve them for easier access to milk, hair, meat, and skins.
Domesticated goats were generally kept in herds that roamed hills or other grazing areas, often accompanied by goats that were mostly children or juveniles, similar to the more familiar shepherds.
Carriageways were built in England as early as the 16th century.
Although early railways consisted only of parallel wooden beams, they allowed horse-drawn wagons to achieve greater speeds and to pull larger loads than on the slightly uneven roads of the time.
Railroad bars were introduced early enough to keep the rails in place, but it was gradually realized that rails would be more efficient with an iron bar on top.
This became standard practice, but the iron caused more damage to the wooden wheels of the car.
In time, wooden wheels were replaced by iron ones, and in 1767 the first railway was made of full iron.
The first known form of transport was walking, with humans walking upright 2 million years ago with the appearance of Homo Erectus (meaning upright man).
Their predecessors, the Australopithecines, did not walk upright as is customary.
Perfection in bipedalism has been found in Australopithecus fossils from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, although Sahaleanthropus may have walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can start living more environmentally friendly lives, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even become activists to reduce suffering in the future.
In many cases, this is symptomatic, but if we do not want a temporary solution, we should find the root cause of the problem and put it out.
Clearly, the world has changed a lot because of mankind's scientific and technological advances, and the problems have been exacerbated by the overcrowding and extravagant lifestyle of mankind.
After adoption by Congress on July 4, a handwritten draft signed by Congressman John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was sent a few blocks away, to John Dunlap's printing press.
Between 150 and 200 specimens, now known as the Dunlap side, were made overnight.
Nixon first read the document publicly on July 8 in the courtyard of Independence Hall.
A copy was sent to George Washington on July 6, read to his troops in New York on July 9, and a copy arrived in London on August 10.
The 25 Dunlap manuscripts that are known to still exist are the oldest extant copies of the document.
Many paleontologists today believe that one group of dinosaurs survived and is alive today.
Many people do not consider them dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
But there are many things about birds that still look like dinosaurs.
They have feet with hooves and claws, lay eggs, and walk on two hind legs like the Tyrannosaurus rex.
Virtually all computers in use today are based on handling information encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can have only one of two values, i.e., 0 or 1, and these numbers are called binary digits - or bits in computer jargon.
It may not be immediately obvious that internal poisoning is involved, and symptoms such as vomiting are common enough that a diagnosis cannot be made immediately.
The best indicator of internal poisoning may be the presence of open packaging of medicines or toxic household chemicals.
Look at the label to see specific first-aid instructions for that particular poison.
Entomologists use the term bug in a formal sense for this group of insects.
The term comes from an ancient acquaintance with the stink bugs, which are very well adapted to parasitize humans.
Both killer and common ticks are species that stay with parents for a long time, adapted to life in a litter or host's home.
Across the United States, there are approximately 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), making it the leading neurological disease in young and middle-aged persons.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which consists of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Research has shown that women are twice as likely to have MS symptoms as men.
A couple may decide that raising a baby is not in their best interests or in the best interests of their child.
These couples may decide to plan for the adoption of a baby.
In the case of adoption, the biological parents renounce their parental rights so that the other couple can be the parent of the child.
The main task of science is to understand the way the world works using the scientific method, which actually governs most scientific research.
However, experimentation is not the only one, and an experiment is a test used to eliminate one or more possible hypotheses.
Physicists and philosophers focused on classical texts, especially the Latin Bible.
Aristotle's views on all scientific questions, including psychology, were respected.
As Greek knowledge declined, the West found itself cut off from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many observed rhythms in physiology and behavior often depend crucially on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production by biological clocks.
Periodic biological rhythms that are not just responses to periodic changes in external influences are noted in most living organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that will continue with a period of free-running rotation, even if there are no external signs.
The Hershey-Chase experiment was one of the leading indicators that DNA is genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages, or viruses, to insert their own DNA into bacteria.
They did two experiments in which they labeled DNA phages with radioactive phosphorus or protein phages with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have different effects depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the part of the genetic material that is affected, and whether the cells affected are reproductive cells.
Only mutations in germ cells can be passed on to children, while mutations elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism attracts people who are interested in visiting natural areas, and for the purpose of enjoying the landscape, including the plant and animal wildlife.
Field activities include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, visits to parks, and study of ecosystem data.
One example is visiting, photographing, and learning about orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning people leave small rural places by car to go to their workplaces, passing by those whose workplace is in the very place they have just left.
In this dynamic transportation process, all are somehow connected and support a transportation system based on private cars.
Science now suggests that this large-carbon economy has pushed the biosphere out of one of its stable states that have supported human evolution for the past two million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses the transportation system.
In developed countries, similar complaints about water quality or collapsing bridges are rare.
Why do transportation systems cause such complaints and why do they make mistakes every day?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points, as well as their interactions with each other.
Unfortunately, studying traffic flows is difficult because driver behavior cannot be predicted with absolute certainty.
Fortunately, drivers generally behave within a reasonable consistency range; therefore traffic flows have some reasonable consistency and can be represented roughly mathematically.
To better represent the flow of traffic, relationships were established between three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These relationships help in the planning, design, and operation of facilities along the way.
Insects were the first animals to take to the air, and their ability to fly helped them to avoid enemies and to find food and mates more efficiently.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings around their bodies.
This gives them a greater choice of different small places to hide from predators.
The only insects today that cannot fold their wings are the horse-faced fairies and the water flowers.
Thousands of years earlier, a man named Aristarchus had said that the solar system revolves around the sun.
Some people believed that he was right, but many believed the opposite; that the solar system revolves around the Earth, including the Sun (and even other stars).
This makes sense, since it doesn't feel like the earth is moving, does it?
The Amazon River is the second longest and the first largest river on Earth, carrying eight times as much water as the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, with a local width of six miles.
As much as 20 percent of the water that flows from the world's rivers into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The Amazon River is 3,980 miles (6,387 km) long and collects water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although the building of stone pyramids continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, nothing surpassed the pyramids at Giza in their size and technical excellence.
Ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom admired the monuments of their predecessors, which were by then over a thousand years old.
With a population of about 800, the Vatican is the smallest independent state in the world and the least populous.
The Vatican uses Italian in its laws and official communication.
Italian is also the everyday language used by most of those working in the state, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All Vatican citizens are Roman Catholics.
People have known basic chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper since ancient times, since they can be found in nature in their original form and can be relatively easily extracted with primitive tools.
The philosopher Aristotle theorized that everything is made up of a mixture of only one or a few of the four elements - earth, water, air, and fire.
This was more like the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gaseous, plasma, although he also theorized that these were converted into new substances, to form what we see.
Alloy is actually a mixture of two or more metals.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are also metals such as silver and gold.
There are also alloys that consist of small amounts of nonmetals such as carbon.
Everything in the universe is made up of matter, and all matter is made up of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly small that billions of them could fit into a dot at the end of this sentence.
Thus, the pencil was a good friend to many people when it first appeared.
Sadly, with the advent of new writing methods, the pencil was relegated to a lower status and less used.
People now text on a computer screen without ever having been near a clipboard.
We can only wonder what the keyboard will become when it finds something new.
A physical bomb works on the principle that it takes energy to make a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
This is like pushing heavy wagons up a hill, and the re-cracking of the core then releases some energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, meaning that they tend to decay with little or no stimulation.
The surface of the moon is made up of rock and dust, and the outer layer of the moon is called the crust.
The crust is about 70 km (43 mi) thick on the near side and 100 km (62 mi) thick on the far side.
It is thinner under the lunar sea, and thicker under the hills.
Perhaps there are more lunar seas nearby because the crust is thinner.
Content theories are geared toward finding out what moves people or what they like.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that they internalize as they mature into adults.
These theories study what it is about certain people that makes them want the things they do, and what things in their environment will make them do or not do certain things.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs theory and Herzberg's two-factor theory.
Generally speaking, two forms of behavior can emerge when managers start to lead their former colleagues.
This type of manager has difficulty making unpopular decisions, enforcing disciplinary measures, evaluating performance, assigning responsibility, and holding people accountable.
At the other end of the spectrum, the individual becomes an unrecognizable individual who feels that he must change everything he has worked for and make it his own.
Ultimately, the leader is the one responsible for the success or failure of the team.
This behavior often results in a gap between the leader and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams should meet the same quality standards as conventional teams, but there are subtle differences.
Virtual team members often function as a contact for their immediate physical group.
They often have more autonomy than conventional team members, as their teams can meet according to different time zones for which local leadership would have no understanding.
The presence of a real "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p. 109) is also a unique element of a virtual team.
An Invisible Team is a management team to which each member reports. An Invisible Team sets standards for each member.
One of the goals for applying organizational learning concepts into practice is innovation.
When all available resources are used efficiently in the functional departments of an organization, creativity and ingenuity can come into play.
As a result, the organizational process of working together to overcome obstacles can lead to a new innovative process that will meet the needs of the customer.
Before an organization can be innovative, leadership must create a culture of innovation, as well as shared knowledge and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) explains the continuum approach as a method used to help organizations achieve higher levels of productivity.
Neurobiological data provide physical evidence for a theoretical approach to the study of cognitive abilities, thus narrowing the field of study and making it much more accurate.
The link between brain pathology and behavior supports the claims of scientists in their research.
It has long been known that various types of brain damage, trauma, injury, and tumor affect behavior and cause changes in some mental functions.
New technologies allow us to see and explore brain structures and processes that we have never seen before.
This provides us with a lot of data and material to make simulation models that help us understand processes in our minds.
Although AI draws a strong connotation from science fiction, AI is a very important branch of computer science that deals with behavior, learning, and intelligent adaptation of machines.
Research in the field of artificial intelligence involves building machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include control, planning and scheduling, the ability to respond to diagnoses and client questions, as well as handwriting, voice, and facial recognition.
Such things have become separate disciplines that focus on providing solutions to real-life problems.
Artificial intelligence (AI) systems are now commonly used in economics, medicine, engineering, and military applications, as they are embedded in several home computers and video game application software.
Often, a teacher would like to take her students to places where bus travel is not an option.
Technology offers solutions in the form of virtual tours, where students can view museum exhibits, visit an aquarium, or admire fine art while sitting in their classroom.
Virtual sharing of the trip experience is also a great way to reflect on the trip and share the experience with future classes.
For example, each year students at the Bennett School in North Carolina design a web page about their trip to the state capital, each year the web page is redesigned, but the older versions are stored online so that they can serve as an album.
Blogs can also help improve writing in students. Although students often start their blogging experience with messy grammar and spelling, audience presence largely changes that.
Since students are often the most critical of audiences, the blogger begins to work on fixing his writing to avoid criticism.
Also, blogging "forces students to become more discernible in the world around them". The need to stimulate audience interest inspires students to be smart and curious (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that inspires collaboration and encourages students to extend learning beyond the traditional school day.
Appropriate use of blogs can empower students to become more analytical and critical; through active reaction to materials from the Internet, students can define their views in the context of others' texts, as well as express their own perspectives on certain issues (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada's charming, bilingual capital, and boasts a whole host of art galleries and museums that depict Canada's past and present.
Further south are Niagara Falls, while the north is a haven for the unspoiled natural beauty of Muskogee and beyond.
All of this makes Ontario stand out even more as something foreigners consider to be fundamentally Canadian.
Large areas further north are fairly sparsely populated, and some are almost entirely uninhabited wilderness.
For a population comparison that surprises many: there are more African Americans living in the United States than Canadian citizens.
The East African islands are located in the Indian Ocean off the eastern coast of Africa.
Madagascar is arguably the largest island, and a continent unto itself when it comes to wildlife.
Most of the smaller islands are independent nations, or in association with France, and are known as luxury beach resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam to the mainland, and it was widely adopted in the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century, when the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama found the Cape's way from Europe to India.
The region is bounded on the north by the Sahel, and on the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
Wives: It is recommended that all passengers state that they are married, regardless of actual marital status.
It is also helpful to wear a ring (not just one that looks too expensive).
Women should understand that cultural differences can lead to what they would consider harassment, and it is not uncommon for them to be followed, held by the hand, etc.
Be firm in your rejection of men, and do not be afraid to take a stand (cultural differences or not, that does not mean it is okay!)
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century B.C.E. and was used by the Phoenicians, Romans, and Merenids as a strategic port called Anpha.
The Portuguese destroyed and rebuilt it as Casa Branca, only to abandon it after the 1755 earthquake.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city under the name of Daru l-Badia, and Spanish traders who established trading bases there named it Casablanca.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting cities for shopping in all of Morocco.
In the vicinity of the old Medina, it is easy to find places selling traditional Moroccan goods, such as baguettes, pottery, leather goods, coconuts, and a variety of drangulis, but all of these are for tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the Democratic Republic of Congo in the far east near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was destroyed in the Nyaragongo lava flood, which flooded most of the city streets, especially in the city center.
Although Goma is fairly safe, any visits outside Goma should be thoroughly investigated to understand the state of the ongoing fighting in North Kivu province.
This city is also the base from which the ascent of the Yiragongo volcano begins, along with some of the cheapest mountain gorilla tracking in Africa.
You can use a boda-bodu (motorcycle-style taxi) to get around Goma.
Because of its relative impenetrability, Timbuktu is used as a metaphor for exotic, distant lands.
Today, Timbuktu is a poor city, although its reputation makes it a tourist attraction and it has an airport.
In 1990, Timbuktu was added to the list of World Heritage Sites in Danger because of the threat posed by desert sand.
It was one of the main stations of Henry Louis Gates during the filming of The Wonder of the African World, on PBS.
This city is in sharp contrast to other cities in the state, as it has more Arab than African backgrounds.
Kruger National Park (NPK) is located northeast of South Africa and borders Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, while the southern boundary is the Crocodile River.
The park covers 19,500 square kilometers and is divided into 14 different ecozones, each of which is home to different wildlife.
It is one of South Africa's main attractions and is considered the main attraction of South African National Parks (JANParks).
As in all South African national parks, there are daily conservation and park entrance fees.
Consideration should also be given to purchasing a wild card, which gives access to certain South African parks or to all national parks of the Republic of South Africa.
Hong Kong Island gives the territory of Hong Kong its name, and it is the place that many tourists consider to be the main focus.
The series of buildings that make up the skyline of Hong Kong has been compared to a glossy tracery that is made evident by the presence of the waters of Victoria Harbour.
To get the best view of Hong Kong, leave the island and head for the Kaulon waterfront on the opposite side.
Most of Hong Kong's urban area is densely packed on reclaimed land along the northern coast.
This place was claimed by the British colonists, so if you're looking for evidence of the territory's colonial past, this is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans is the largest coastal mangrove belt in the world, stretching 80 km (50 mi) from the coast to the hinterlands of Bangladesh and India.
The Sundarbans is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Part of the forest within the Indian territory is called Sundarbans National Park.
However, the forests are not just mangrove swamps - they also include some of the last remaining mighty jungles that once covered the Gangetic plain.
The Sundarbans extends over an area of 3,850 km2, of which one third is covered by water/wetlands.
Since 1966, Sundarbans has been a wildlife sanctuary, and it is estimated that the area now houses 400 royal Bengal tigers and some 30,000 deer packs.
Buses depart from the intercity bus station (across the river) throughout the day, although most, especially those going east and to Jakarta/Bumtang, depart between 06:30 and 07:30.
Because intercity buses are often crowded, it is advisable to buy a ticket several days in advance.
Most districts are served by Japanese minibuses, which are comfortable and durable.
Sharing a taxi is a quick and convenient way to get to nearby places, such as Paro (N 150) and Punaka (N 200).
The Oiapoque River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge that spans the Oiapoque River to connect the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges del Oiapoque in French Guiana.
The two towers reach a height of 83 meters (280 feet), and the bridge is 378 meters (1,750 feet) long and has two lanes, each 12.5 feet (3.50 m) wide.
The vertical opening below the bridge is 15 metres wide. Construction was completed in August 2011, but it was not opened to traffic until March 2017.
It is planned to fully put the bridge into use in September 2017, when the completion of the customs checkpoints on the Brazilian side is expected.
The Hurans were the most important indigenous group inhabiting what is now eastern Paraguay, and they lived as semi-nomadic hunters who also engaged in self-sustaining agriculture.
The Chaco region was home to other groups of indigenous tribes such as the Guacurú and the Payaguas, who made a living by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
Paraguay, formerly known as the "Divine Province of the Indies", was founded in the 16th century as a result of the encounters of Spanish conquistadors with indigenous indigenous groups.
The Spanish began a period of colonization that lasted three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to retain much of its indigenous character and identity.
Argentina is known for having one of the best polo teams and players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year is held in December at the polo grounds in Las Cañitas.
Minor tournaments and swords can also be seen here at other times of the year.
For all tournament news and information on where to buy tickets for polo matches, check out the Argentine Polo Association (Asociacion Argentina de Polo).
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland pound (FRF) whose value is set to the equivalent of one British pound (GBP).
You can exchange money at the only bank on the islands located in Stanley via the FIC West trading route.
British pounds will generally be accepted anywhere on the islands and within Stanley credit cards, and US dollars are also often accepted.
Credit cards are unlikely to be accepted on remote islands, although British and United States currencies may be accepted; check with the owners in advance to determine which payment method is acceptable.
It is almost impossible to exchange Falkland currency outside the island, so exchange money before leaving the island.
Since Montevideo is south of the equator, it is summer there when it is winter in the northern hemisphere, and vice versa.
Montevideo has a subtropical climate; temperatures in excess of 100 degrees Fahrenheit [30°C] are common during the summer months.
Winters can be deceptively cold: temperatures rarely go below freezing, but the combination of wind and humidity gives the feeling of being much colder than the thermometer says.
There are no distinct wet and dry seasons: the amount of rainfall is roughly the same throughout the year.
Although many animals in the park are used to seeing people, the wildlife is still wild, and they should not be fed or disturbed.
According to the park administration, keep at least 100 yards per meter from bears and wolves and 25 yards per meter from all other wildlife!
Regardless of their pet appearance, buffalo, North American and European elk, bears, and almost all large animals can attack.
Each year, dozens of visitors are injured because they did not keep proper distances. These animals are large, wild, and potentially dangerous, so give them space.
Also, know that smells attract bears and other wildlife, so avoid carrying or cooking food with a strong smell, and keep the camp clean.
Apia, the capital of Samoa, is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of just under 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850's, and has officially held the title of capital of Samoa since 1959.
The port was the site of a notorious naval skirmish in 1889 when seven ships from Germany, the United States, and Britain refused to leave the port.
All but one British cruiser was sunk, with the loss of nearly two hundred American and German lives.
During the struggle for independence organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful rally in the city resulted in the assassination of the Tupuá's supreme leader, Tamases Lealófia III.
Since Auckland is spread over two harbours, there are many beaches, the most popular being those in three areas:
The North Shore Beaches (in the North Locks area) are located on the Pacific Ocean and stretch from Long Bay in the north to Davenport in the south.
Almost all beaches are sandy with safe swimming pools, and most of them are cool enough to make trees shudder.
Tamaki Drive Beaches are in the port of Waitemath, in the affluent suburbs of Mission Bay and St. Heliers in central Auckland.
These are family beaches that are sometimes crowded, and with a rich array of shops that run along the shore.
The main local beer is Number One, which is not a complex beer but is pleasant and refreshing.
There are many French wines that are good to try, but New Zealand and Australian wines may be better for the trip.
Local tap water is safe to drink, but bottled water is easy to find if you are afraid.
For Australians, coffee is a foreign term, the short form being black, the cappuccino comes with a high-flowing straw (not foam), and the tea is served without milk.
Hot chocolate meets Belgian standards, and fruit juices are expensive but exceptional.
Many trips to the reef are organized throughout the year, and injuries caused by any of the above are rare.
Nevertheless, accept the advice of the authorities, respect all signs, and pay close attention to safety warnings.
Quarter jellyfish appear near the beach and near the mouth of the river from October to April 1770 north of the city.
Most sharks are afraid of humans and will swim as far away from you as possible.
Sea crocodiles do not live actively in the open, their primary habitat being the river estuaries north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance gives the passenger confidence that he will have a place to sleep when he arrives at his destination.
Travel agents often have agreements with certain hotels, although you may be able to book other forms of accommodation, such as camping, through them.
Travel agents usually offer arrangements that include breakfast, a guaranteed ride to/from the airport, or even a combination of a flight and a hotel arrangement.
They can also save you a reservation if you need time to think about the offer or can obtain other documents you need for the destination you are visiting (e.g. a visa).
Any supplement or request should first be sent to a travel agent, not directly to a hotel.
At some festivals, the vast majority of music festival attendees choose to camp on-site, and most attendees consider this a significant part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the action, you will have to arrive early to secure a camping spot near the music.
Remember that while the music may have stopped on the main stages, there may be parts of the festival that play music late into the night.
Some festivals have special camping spots for families with young children.
If you cross the northern Baltic during the winter, check the location of the hut, since crossing the ice creates quite terrible sounds for those most affected.
Cruise passengers are exempt from visa requirements (check conditions).
Casinos usually go to great lengths to maximize the time and money that visitors spend, with windows and watches generally missing and exits hard to find.
They usually have special offerings of food, drink, and entertainment to keep guests in a good mood and to keep them in the facility.
However, drunkenness affects judgment, and all good gamblers know the importance of staying sober.
Anyone planning to drive over long latitudes or over mountain passes should consider the possibility of snow, ice, or subzero temperatures.
On icy and snowy roads, the traffic is weak and you cannot drive as if you were on asphalt.
During a snowstorm, enough snow can fall in a very short time to get you stuck.
Visibility can also limit snow falling or flying, as well as fog or ice on vehicle windows.
On the other hand, snow and ice conditions are normal in many countries, and traffic is generally uninterrupted year-round.
The safari is probably the biggest tourist attraction in Africa and the highlight of many visitors' experiences.
In popular usage, the term safari refers to a land trip in which you can see stunning African wildlife, especially in savannahs.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to approach cars slowly, so standard equipment provides good visibility.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards are sometimes shy, so you can better see them with binoculars.
A walking safari (also called a nature walk, hiking safari, or hiking tour) consists of a walk, lasting a few hours or a couple of days.
The Paralympics will be held from 24 August to 5 September 2021, with some events taking place at other locations across Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to host two Summer Olympics, having hosted the 1964 Games.
If you booked your flights and accommodations for 2020 before the delay was announced, you may find yourself in a bad situation.
Cancellation policies vary, but as of late March, most coronavirus cancellation policies do not apply until July 2020, for when the Olympic Games are scheduled.
The expected price of most tickets for events will range from 2,500 and 130,000 yen, with the price of typical tickets being about 7,000 yen.
Many hotels offer to rent a washing machine and washing boards, even if you do not have them in your room.
If a hair dryer is not available, or if you do not like to wear baked socks, then you can try using a hair fan, if available.
Be careful that the fabric does not become too hot (which may lead to coagulation or, in extreme cases, to frostbite).
There are several ways to purify water, some of which yield better results than certain threats.
In some areas, one minute of boiling water is sufficient, while in others it takes several minutes.
Filters vary in efficiency, and if you are concerned, then you should consider buying water from reputable bottled companies.
Travelers may encounter animals and pests unfamiliar to them in their native regions.
Pests can spoil food, cause irritation, or in the worst case cause allergic reactions, spread poison, or transmit infections.
Infectious diseases or dangerous animals that can injure or kill a person by force are not usually considered pests.
Duty-free shopping is an opportunity to buy goods exempt from taxes and excise duties in certain locations.
Travelers to high-tax countries can sometimes save considerable amounts of money, especially on products such as alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The road between Point Marion and Fairmont provides the most challenging driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Highway, as it often passes through isolated rural areas.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, be prepared to react quickly: steep slopes, narrow lanes, and steep curves dominate.
The posted speed limits are noticeably lower than on previous and later sections  usually 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h)  and their strict adherence is even more important than otherwise.
Interestingly, however, the mobile phone network is much stronger here than along many other stretches of road, such as the Pennsylvania Wilderness.
German pastries are quite good, and in Bavaria they are quite rich and varied, similar to that of its southern neighbor, Austria.
Fruit cakes are frequent, with apples baked throughout the year, while hangers and plums appear during the summer.
Many German baked goods also contain almonds, lentils, and other nuts. Popular cakes often go particularly well with a cup of strong coffee.
If you want a small but rich pastry, try what is called a berliner, a pancake, or a crouton, depending on the region.
Curry is a herb-based and spicy dish in combination with meat or vegetables.
The curry may be either suv or mocar, depending on the amount of liquid.
In inland areas of northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is commonly used in curries; in southern India and some coastal areas of the subcontinent, coconut milk is commonly used.
With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian cuisine is a general term that encompasses a wide range of regional cuisines throughout the country.
But when used without additional terms, the term usually denotes food originating in the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Now available throughout the archipelago, Javanese cuisine contains a rich array of simply spiced dishes, among which are the predominant flavours favored by Javanese such as peanuts, chili, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar) and various aromatic spices.
The stakes are the rider's footrests that hang from either side of the saddle.
They provide greater stability to the rider, but they can pose a safety problem because of the possibility of the rider's foot entangling itself in them.
If a rider is thrown off but his leg gets stuck in the saddle, he may be pulled back if the horse continues to run.
First of all, most riders wear riding boots, with a heel and a smooth, rather narrow waist.
Then, let the saddle, especially the English saddle, have safety barriers that allow the leather strap to fall off the saddle if pulled by the rider at the moment of fall.
The Colimachamo Valley - Chile's main climbing destination, known as the Yosemite of South America, with numerous large granite walls and cliffs.
From the highest peaks, breathtaking views are offered, and climbers from all over the world are constantly establishing new routes among the unfathomable potential of the mountain's sides.
Snowboarding, which includes skiing and snowboarding, is a popular sport that involves descending a snow-covered terrain on skis or a snowboard attached to your feet.
Skiing is a major activity during the trip, and many enthusiasts, often known as skiers, plan entire holidays spent skiing at a particular location.
The idea of skiing is extremely old - cave paintings depicting skis date back as far as 5000 B.C.E.!
Alpine skiing as a sport has existed since at least the 17th century, and in 1861 the first recreational ski club was opened by Norwegians in Australia.
Skiing: This activity is also often called cross-country skiing, ski touring, or ski hiking.
It is related to, but does not usually involve, ski touring or alpine style mountaineering; the latter is performed on steep terrain and requires much tighter skis and boots.
Imagine a ski route as similar to a hiking trail.
In good conditions you will be able to cover a little more than walking  but you will very rarely reach the speed of Nordic skiing without a heavy backpack on paved trails.
Europe is a relatively small continent, but with many independent states. Under normal circumstances, traveling through several countries would mean having to go through visa and passport control several times.
In this respect, however, the Schengen area functions similarly to a single state.
As long as you stay in this zone, you can generally cross the border without re-entering passport control points.
Similarly, when you have a Schengen visa, you do not have to apply for visas for each of the Schengen member states separately, which saves time, money, and avoids paperwork.
There is no universal definition of what constitutes an antique, and some tax agencies define items over 100 years old as antiques.
The definition has geographical variations, where the age limit might be shorter in places like North America relative to Europe.
Handmade objects can be defined as antiques, even though they are younger than some similar mass-produced objects.
Irvas cultivation is important to the life of the Lapuans, and culture in the trade is also important to many who engage in other professions.
However, even traditionally, not all Sami were largely devoted to raising irvas, but lived from fishing, hunting, and similar activities, and irvas were mainly used for drawing and carrying loads.
Today, many Lapps are engaged in modern crafts, and tourism is a significant source of income in Lapland, an area located in the Lapland region.

Bad weather is a generic term for any dangerous weather phenomenon that has the potential to cause damage, serious social disruption, or lead to loss of human life.
Bad weather can occur anywhere in the world, and there are different types depending on geography, topography, and weather conditions.
Strong winds, storms, excessive rainfall, and wildfires are the forms and effects of severe weather, as are thunderstorms, tornadoes, water spills, and cyclones.
Regional and seasonal hazardous weather events include blizzards, snowstorms, ice storms, and sandstorms.
Travelers are strongly advised to be aware of the risks of bad weather in the area where they are, as it may affect their travel plans.
Anyone who wants to travel to a country that could be called a war zone would have to undergo vocational training first.
If you type "Hostile Environments Course" in an Internet search, you will likely find the address of a local company.
The course will usually cover all the issues discussed here in much greater detail, mostly with practical experience.
The course will usually last from 2 to 5 days and will involve role-playing, a lot of first aid, and sometimes weapons training.
Books and magazines dealing with wildlife survival are abundant, but publications dealing with war zones are few.
Travelers planning sex-change surgery abroad must check that they carry valid return documents.
The willingness of governments to issue passports that do not identify a person as gender (X) or documents that are updated to match the desired name and gender varies.
The willingness of foreign governments to execute this document varies equally.

Preoperative transgender people should not expect to be let through the scans with privacy and dignity intact.
The scattered currents are the backflow of waves that break off from the beach, often present on a reef or similar places.
Because of the underwater topology, the backflow is concentrated in a few deeper parts and there a rapid current can be created to deep water.
Most deaths are due to fatigue while attempting to swim upstream, which may be unfeasible.
Once you get out of the stream, swimming back is not as difficult as it is otherwise.
Try to aim somewhere where you will not be caught again, or, depending on your skill and whether you are noticed, you may want to wait to be rescued.
Recurrent shock occurs earlier than culture shock (the period of the honeymoon phase is shorter), lasts longer, and can be more severe.
Travelers who have found it easy to adjust to a new culture sometimes find it especially difficult to adjust to their native culture again.
When you return home from living abroad, you have adapted to a new culture and have lost some of your native culture's habits.
When you first went abroad, people were likely patient and understanding, knowing that travelers in a new land must adjust.
People may not expect that the travelers returning home will also need patience and understanding.
The sound and light show in the pyramid is one of the most interesting things here for children.
You can see the pyramids in the dark and you can see them in the silence before the show starts.
The story of sound and light is like a book of stories.
The sphinx is set as the backdrop and narrator of the long story.
Scenes are shown on pyramids, and various pyramids are illuminated.
In the South Shetland Islands discovered in 1819, many nations lay claim to and have the most bases, with sixteen being active in 2020.
The archipelago is located 120 km north of the peninsula.
Others include Livingston Island and Deception Island where the flooded caldera of the still-active volcano provides a spectacular natural harbor.
Ellsworth Land is a region south of the peninsula, surrounded by the Bellinghausen Sea.
Here the mountains of the peninsula merge into a plateau, then reappear to form the 200-mile-long (360 km) chain of Mount Ellsworth, divided by the glacier of Minnesota.
The northern part of the Sentinel Range contains the highest mountains in Antarctica, the Vinson Massif, with Vinson's highest peak reaching 4,892 m (14,090 ft).
In remote areas without cell phone coverage, a satellite phone may be your only option.
A satellite phone is not usually a replacement for a mobile phone, since to make a call you must be out in the open and have a clear view of the satellite.
This service is often used for travel by ship, including yacht, as well as for expeditions that require remote data and voice.
Your local telephone service provider should be able to provide more information about connecting to this service.
An increasingly popular option for those planning a year off is to travel and study.
This is especially popular with those who are finishing school, as it allows them to take a year off before college without jeopardizing their education.
In many cases, taking a course abroad during the breaking year can improve the prospects for advancing toward higher education in the country of origin.
There are mainly tuition fees for enrolling in some of these educational programs.
Finland is a great sailing destination. The "Land of a Thousand Lakes" also has thousands of islands, in lakes and in coastal archipelagos.
In the archipelago and lakes you do not need a yacht.
While the coastal archipelagoes and the largest lakes are indeed large enough for any yacht, smaller boats or even kayaks offer a different experience.
Boating is a national pastime in Finland, with boats for every seven or eight people.
This is the case in Norway, Sweden, and New Zealand, but it is otherwise very unique (e.g. in the Netherlands the number is from one to forty).
Most of the various Baltic cruises have extended stays in St. Petersburg, Russia.
This means that you can visit the historic city for a couple of whole days, and return and sleep on the boat overnight.
If you are going to the coast only as part of boat trips, you do not need a special visa (as of 2009).
As you can see from the map above, Berlin is not even close to the sea, and a visit to the city is not included in the cruise fare.
Air travel can be a frightening experience for people of all backgrounds and ages, especially if they have never flown before or have experienced a traumatic event.
It is not something to be ashamed of: it is no different from the personal fears and disagreements about other things that many people have.
For some, understanding how a drone works and what happens during flight can help them overcome fears based on the unknown or the impossibility of controlling events.
Time is often of the essence when it comes to business documents, deliveries, or spare parts for emergency repairs.
On some routes, larger companies have their own planes, but for some other routes or smaller firms it has been a problem.
If they sent goods by air freight, it may have taken days on some routes to get through customs and customs.
The only way to get through was to send the baggage as checked in. Airlines regulations will not allow them to send baggage without a passenger, where you enter the story.
The obvious way to fly first or business class is to set aside a fat pile of money for that privilege (or, better yet, to get the company you work for to do it for you).
This is not cheap, however: as a general rule, you can expect to pay up to four times the usual economy card for business, and eleven times more for first class!
Generally speaking, there is no point in even asking for discounts on jobs and first-class seats on direct flights from A to B.
Airlines know well that there is a certain group of passengers who are willing to pay extra for the privilege of getting somewhere quickly and comfortably, and they charge accordingly.
The capital of Moldova is Chisinau. The local language is Romanian, but Russian is widely spoken.
Moldova is a multiethnic republic that has been ravaged by ethnic conflict.
This conflict resulted in the creation in 1994 of the self-proclaimed Transnistrian Republic in eastern Moldova, which has its own government and currency but is not recognized by any UN member state.
Economic ties were re-established between these two parts of Moldova, despite the failure of political negotiations.
The main religion in Moldova is Orthodox Christianity.
Izmir is the third largest city in Turkey with about 3.7 million inhabitants, the second largest port after Istanbul, as well as a very good transport hub.
Once an ancient city, Smyrna is now a modern, developed, and urbanized commercial center located in a large bay surrounded by mountains.
Wide boulevards, glass-walled buildings, and modern shopping malls are dotted with traditional red-tiled roofs, an 18th-century marketplace, and old mosques and churches, though the city has more of a Mediterranean European atmosphere than a traditional Turkish one.
The village of Halderswijk offers views of the nearby island of Øystroy, and has an unusual octagonal church.
In the church's porch are interesting marble sculptures of doves over some graves.
It is worth setting aside half an hour for a stroll through the intriguing village.

Do not ruin the space by making signs or carving graffiti on objects.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish, and about half the population prefers to speak Catalan, the vast majority understand it, and virtually everyone knows Spanish.
However, most of the signage is in Catalan only, since it is established by law as the first official language.
Yet, Spanish is also widely used in public transport and other facilities.
Regular subway announcements are in Catalan only, but unplanned interruptions are automatically posted in a large number of languages, such as Spanish, English, French, Arabic, and Japanese.
Parisians have a reputation for being self-centered, unkind, and arrogant.
Although this is often just an inaccurate stereotype, the best way to get along with people in Paris is to behave nicely - like someone who is bien élevé (well-behaved).
The rude behavior of Parisians quickly fades away if you show a little basic courtesy.
Plitvice Lakes National Park is heavily forested, mostly with beech, willow and oak trees, and contains a mix of alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
It has an extremely wide range of plant communities, due to its range of microclimates, differing soils, and varying levels of altitude.
The area is also home to an extremely large number of different species of animals and birds.
Rare animal species can be found here, including brown bears, wolves, eagles, owls, lynx, wild cats, and great terns, as well as many more endemic species
When visiting monasteries, women must wear skirts below the knees, as well as cover their shoulders.
Most monasteries have provided dresses for women who come unprepared, but if you bring your own dress, especially in bright colors, you will put a smile on the face of the monk or nun at the entrance.
By the same rule, men must wear pants that cover the knees.
And you can borrow these from the supply at the entrance, but those clothes don't wash after every wear, so you might not feel comfortable wearing these dresses.
Majorcan cuisine, like those of similar areas in the Mediterranean, is based on bread, vegetables, and meat (especially pork), and uses olive oil in general.
A simple popular dinner, especially during the summer, is pa amb oli: bread with olive oil, tomatoes and any available ingredients such as cheese, tuna, etc.
All nouns, including Sie, which stands for Vi, are always capitalized, even in the middle of a sentence.
This is an important way to distinguish between some verbs and objects.
It can also be said to facilitate reading, although writing is somewhat complicated by the need to determine whether a verb or a prefix is used in the form of a pronoun.
Pronunciation is relatively easy in Italian, since most words are pronounced as they are written.
The basic letters to pay attention to are c and g, since their pronunciation varies depending on the accompanying consonant.
Also, try to pronounce r and r differently: karro means dear, while karro means carriage.
The Persian language has a relatively simple and generally correct grammar.
Therefore, reading this grammar letter would help you to learn much about the grammar of Persian and to understand phrases better.
Needless to say, if you speak some Romance language, you will find it easier to learn Portuguese.
However, people who speak little Spanish may quickly conclude that Portuguese is similar enough that it does not have to be learned separately.
The pre-modern observatories are mostly obsolete today, and they exist as museums or educational facilities.
Since light pollution in their heyday was not as much of a problem as it is today, they can usually be found in cities or on campuses, where they were more readily available than they are built in modern times.
Most modern telescopes are huge installations in remote areas with favorable atmospheric conditions.
Watching cherry blossoms, known as hanami, has been part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
The concept originated in China where plywood flowers were the flowers of choice.
In Japan, the first cherry blossom celebrations were organized by the emperor for himself and other members of the aristocracy at the imperial court.

If you are visiting a formal garden, collecting symbols will also get you kicked out, and without discussion.
Singapore is generally an extremely safe place to visit and is very easy to get around, and you can buy almost anything on arrival.
But with the view that it is in the "high tropics" just a few degrees north of the equator, you will have to wear both heat (always) and strong sun (when the sky is clear, which is less common).
A couple of buses also go north to Hebron, where the traditional burial place of the Bible patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and their wives is located.
Check that the bus you plan to take goes to Hebron itself, not just to the nearby Jewish settlement of Kirjath-Arba.
Inland river routes can be a good basis for planning a vacation.
For example, visiting the castles of the Loire Valley, the Rhine Valley, or cruising to places of interest on the Danube or taking a boat ride along the Erie Canal.

Christmas is one of Christendom's most important holidays, celebrated as the birth of Jesus.
Many traditions associated with this holiday have been adopted by both non-Christians in Christendom and non-Christians worldwide.
There is a tradition of spending the night without sleep in an open place to watch the sunrise.
Of course, there are Christian theological explanations for this tradition, but it is quite possible that this spring and fertility ritual predates the advent of Christianity.
More traditional churches often hold a Easter vigil on Saturday night during Easter weekend, while communities often begin with a celebration at midnight to celebrate Christ's resurrection.
All the animals that originally arrived on the islands came here by swimming, flying, or floating.
The great distance from the mainland prevented mammals from traveling, making the giant tortoise the primary grazing animal of the Galapagos.
Since man's arrival in the Galapagos, many mammals have been introduced, including goats, horses, cows, rats, cats, and dogs.
If you visit the Arctic or Antarctic regions during the winter, you will experience polar nights, which means that the sun does not rise above the horizon.
This offers a good opportunity to see the Aurora Borealis, since the sky will be darker less and darker throughout the day.
Since the areas are sparsely populated, light pollution is often not a problem, you will also be able to enjoy the stars.
Japanese work culture is hierarchical and more formal than Westerners may be accustomed to.
They dress in business attire, and colleagues call each other by their surname or title.
Harmony in the workplace is crucial, emphasizing group effort rather than praising individual achievements.
Workers often have to seek approval from their superiors for every decision they make, and they are expected to follow their instructions without question.
