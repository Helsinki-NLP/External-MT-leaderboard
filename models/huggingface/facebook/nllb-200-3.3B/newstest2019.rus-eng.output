The number of Ukrainian recruits preparing to be sent to Donbass has been named
The official representative of the People's Militia of the self-proclaimed Luhansk People's Republic (LPR) Andrei Marochko said that in the winter of 2018-2019, Ukraine will send at least 3 thousand recruits to Donbass.
According to him, Kiev is planning to "somehow staff up the units".
"The unwillingness of Ukrainian citizens to serve in the ranks of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, the mass dismissals have led to a low staffing of the units", - said Marochko, quoted by RIA Novosti.
He also did not rule out that the actual numbers of Ukrainians conscripted into the army could be increased if necessary.
In 2014-2017, Kiev launched the so-called anti-terrorist operation (ATO), which was later replaced by the operation of the united forces (OOS).
It was assumed that this measure would lead to the strengthening of the role of Ukrainian security forces in the settlement of the situation.
In late August 2018, the situation in the Donbas escalated due to the murder of the head of the DPR Alexander Zakharchenko.
The DPR authorities have described the incident as a terrorist attack.
During the criminal investigation, several people were arrested for their involvement in the explosion.
According to preliminary data, they confirmed that the sabotage was organized by Ukrainian special services.
US authorities forced Musk to step down as Tesla chairman
American businessman Elon Musk will step down as chairman of the board of directors of the company he founded, Tesla, at the request of the US authorities.
To settle claims of the Federal Securities and Exchange Commission, the entrepreneur will also pay $20 million.
According to CNBC, a pre-trial agreement with the agency allows Musk to remain in a leadership position at Tesla.
He must pay $20 million and resign as chairman of the board within 45 days of the agreement, for at least three years.
Two independent directors will be appointed in his place.
It says the settlement still has to be approved by the court.
On September 28, it was reported that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission accused Musk of misleading shareholders by stating that he had enough funds to buy back the company's shares, and sued the businessman.
It's about a businessman's Twitter post where he said he wanted to buy back Tesla shares at $420 a share, but he never did.
After the tweet, the company's stock went up by almost 11%.
UK Foreign Secretary compares EU to Soviet Union and prison
British Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt compared the European Union to the Soviet Union and accused Brussels of holding the member states captive.
The diplomat made the remarks at the ruling Conservative Party's congress in Birmingham, which opened on Sunday, September 30.
According to the Daily Mail, Hunt was commenting on the difficulties in the Brexit negotiation process.
What happened to the belief in the European dream and its ideals?
The EU was created to protect freedom, and the Soviet Union would not let anyone leave.
The lesson of history is clear: if you turn the EU from a community into a prison, the desire to leave will not diminish but will only increase, and we will not be the only prisoner who wants to escape from captivity", the minister said.
He also added that attempts to punish Britain for its decision to leave the European Union would only exacerbate the crisis, Gazeta.ru notes.
In mid-September, British Prime Minister Theresa May said that Brexit negotiations had reached a dead end.
This was her comment on the outcome of the informal summit of the European Union in Salzburg.
The Brexit decision was made in 2016 following a referendum.
The United Kingdom's withdrawal is expected to take place by April 2019, but negotiations with Brussels on this issue are complicated by a number of factors.
In particular, there is still no clear agreement on how the parties will interact after London leaves the community.
And the Irish border is still open.

Dogs aren't the only gifts.
Kim Jong Un also gave his colleague two tons of the delicious Matsutaka mushrooms.
He ordered these mushrooms to be distributed to Korean War separated family members who have not yet been reunited with their relatives from the DPRK.

Moscow's new buildings with the cheapest apartments
In the first half of 2018, about three thousand housing units with an area of 30 square meters and a cost of up to four million rubles were bought in new buildings in Moscow.
More than half of these transactions were for two residential companies, according to the materials of the Urbanus portal (available at the disposal of "Lenti.ru").

Telegram users complained about a malfunction in the new version
iPhone users have complained about problems with the Telegram messenger after the September 28 update.
You can get a user's phone number from their username.
The complaints relate to gadgets with the current iOS 12 operating system.
According to their owners, the app shows a blank screen or closes immediately after an update.
The messenger rep responded to the malfunction.
They say the problem may be related to the migration of information to the new app written in Swift.
Telegram has temporarily suspended automatic updates until the app is up and running.
On April 13, the Tagansk court of Moscow satisfied the claim of Roskomnadzor for blocking the Telegram messenger in Russia.
Three days later, the operators began to enforce the ruling.
The reason was the refusal of the administration of the messenger to provide the FSB with the keys for decrypting correspondence necessary to obtain data on terrorists.
In August, Telegram changed its privacy policy and agreed to disclose the IP address and mobile phone number of a suspected terrorist user when a court order is obtained.
Telegram audience after the blockade in the Russian Federation decreased by 1.2 million

It was important to get the majority, and I'm happy for the guys who came out to realize the advantage.
We've been playing well for the most part lately, but we haven't been able to score.
The red light behind the gate finally came on.
We knew that Minsk would come out of the game with a lot of energy, and they did.
The game was mostly decisive, the winning goal we scored in the unequal formations.
We managed to have a good third period today, despite the fact that we missed an early goal in that period and it was clear that it would be difficult to continue.
But we played very well in defence, didn't give much of a chance to the opponent, didn't let us catch on the shifts, Dynamo didn't have an attack with a numerical advantage, so everything ended well for us, "Hartley quotes the press service of the Omsk club.

Elon Musk is forced to step down as chairman of Tesla's board of directors.
The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and Tesla founder Elon Musk have settled their fraud case.
This is reported by CNBC News.
According to the channel, as part of the agreement reached, Musk will have to leave the post of head of the board of directors of Tesla.
The commission allowed Musk to keep his position as Tesla's CEO.
The founder of Tesla will also have to pay an administrative fine of $20 million.
They're gonna charge Tesla the same amount.
The money will be distributed among the investors affected.
In addition, the company must appoint two independent directors.
Elon Musk is an American entrepreneur, listed in the 50 richest people on the planet according to Forbes magazine.
He is the head of the space corporation SpaceX, the neurotechnology company Neuralink, and the developer of Tesla electric cars, as well as the co-founder of Paypal.
The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has previously sued Tesla CEO Elon Musk over a tweet he posted about a possible buyout.
Last month, Musk announced plans to take Tesla private and buy back all of its stock at a fixed price of $420.
The $420 price tag was set "because of the significance of this number in marijuana culture", Bloomberg reported earlier, citing the commission's security co-director, Stephen Paikin.
Elon Musk later abandoned his plans to buy back the shares.
Commenting on the lawsuit filed against him by the US Securities and Exchange Commission, the businessman said he considered the fraud charges unfounded, adding that he was very disappointed and saddened by the allegations.
"Honesty is the most important value in my life, and the facts will prove that I have not broken it in any way", the businessman said in an interview with CNBC.
In August, a group of Tesla shareholders filed a class action against Musk, complaining of financial losses.
The plaintiffs claimed that the businessman's posts had cost them.
In particular, one shareholder said that the tweets of the businessman were misleading, which forced sellers of Tesla shares to buy the shares at artificially inflated prices to cover their positions.
Other plaintiffs also argued that Elon Musk's careless statements caused sharp price fluctuations.
In September, Elon Musk also accused the head of research company Citron Research of stock market fraud.
Meanwhile, if Musk had failed to settle his dispute with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, he would have faced the possibility of being removed from the company's board and possibly prison.
This was stated by former commission chairman Harvey Pitt to CNBC.
Musk is a "good guy who can't run a car company".

The WCC compared the possible renaming of the UOC to the actions of fascists
The head of the Department of External Church Relations (OCCR) of the Moscow Patriarchate, Metropolitan Hilarion of Volokolamsk, compared the possible renaming of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church as the Russian Church in Ukraine with the actions of the fascists in Germany.
Metropolitan Hilarion of Volokolamsk - on the causes of the conflict with the Patriarchate of Constantinople, the possible church split and its political implications
He said that now, when "the conflict between Russia and Ukraine is in its most acute stage", renaming the church would be like "the Jews in Nazi Germany putting a yellow six-pointed star on it".
"This is marking the church as an enemy organization, and it is for this purpose that this bill was created", a representative of the ROC said on the air of the "Russia 24" television channel.
The metropolitan also stressed that the UOC is not a Russian church, but a Ukrainian one, because "the faithful of this church consider themselves Ukrainians, they are patriots of their country".
The UOC has called on the exarchs of Constantinople to leave its territory
Grand Prix in Sochi: the anshlag, the Russian car and the return of Kvyat
Within the next ten years, Russia may have its own race car.
This was stated by Russian Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Kozak, summing up the meeting with Russian automakers on the eve of the start of the Russian Grand Prix in Sochi.
The Deputy Prime Minister also shared his opinion on the return of Daniel Kvyat to Toro Rosso and assessed the attendance of the Russian stage of Formula 1.
The result of our meeting with the car manufacturers should be in the foreseeable future the creation of the Russian car "Formula-1", which has no analogues in the world, - said Dmitry Kozak.
We need to encourage our car manufacturers to do that.
There was talk of plans until 2024, but I don't think that's possible at this point.
I think the more realistic timeline is within the next ten years".
From 2012 to 2014, the "Formula 1" under the Russian license was the team "Marusia".
According to the vice-premier, there are already investors ready to invest in the creation of a domestic team in the world championship of auto racing in the class of "Formula-1".
I know that there are motor sports enthusiasts in Russia, wealthy businessmen who are ready to invest, ready to invest in the creation of the Russian team "Formula 1", - he said.
"We are ready to give them moral support.
Let's hope we have a team like that.
I suspect that the idea of creating a team came up partly because such infrastructure appeared in Sochi".
The Sochi Motor Speedway is expecting a big crowd tomorrow.
According to Dmitry Kozak, the organizers managed to sell all 50 thousand tickets.
Look, even at the qualification the stands were practically full, - noted the Vice Prime Minister.
I can tell you that this year's revenue is up 72% from last year.
This is a good, positive result.
We are also preparing an action plan to improve the efficiency of the use of the infrastructure of the Sochi Autodrom throughout the year.
It will be an additional tourist product that will make Sochi even more attractive.
Dmitry Kozak did not miss the main topic of the day for Russian motorsport fans - the return of Daniel Kvyat to "Toro Rosso".
We all congratulate Daniel and wish him success in the next season, - said the Deputy Prime Minister to Izvestia.
He's a very promising racer.
Next year, for the first time in the history of the Formula 1 peloton, two top Russian pilots will be able to take part.
Although the further fate of Sergei Sirotikin in the "Royal races" remains unknown.
His contract with Williams expires at the end of the season, and his results are not yet impressive: he finished 18th in the Russian Grand Prix qualifying.
Let's hope that next season our main pilots will be more than this year, - said Dmitry Kozak.

On September 30, 1928, exactly 90 years ago, British bacteriologist Alexander Fleming announced an unprecedented discovery.
The discovery of penicillin ushered in the era of modern antibiotics, brought Fleming worldwide fame and made him a Nobel laureate.
By the way, the extraction of penicillin from mold was not Fleming's first discovery.
A few years earlier, he had a cold and sowed mucus from his nose on a petri dish, and after a few days he found that the bacteria had been killed.
It was almost by accident that they discovered penicillin.
Fleming's name was included in the list of the 100 most outstanding people in human history.
Many scientists believe that his discovery changed the course of history.
With penicillin, medicine began to cope with most of the ancient diseases that had previously been considered incurable - tuberculosis, syphilis, gangrene...
When Fleming arrived in the French capital in 1945, shortly after receiving the Nobel Prize, the Paris newspapers wrote: "He did more than dozens of divisions to defeat fascism and liberate France".
Experts estimate that Fleming's discovery of the world's first antibiotic saved the lives of over 200 million people on Earth.
Alexander Fleming died at his home in London in 1955 of a heart attack.
He was cremated, and a week later his ashes were buried in London's famous St Paul's Cathedral.
Where, incidentally, my wife and I were alerted to this by a chatty Russian-speaking tour guide.
A few years later, we saw a full-length statue of Alexander Fleming in a very unusual location in the Spanish capital.
There, next to the main bullfighting arena of Plaza de Toros de Las Ventas, the most famous Spanish matadors erected a monument to the man whose efforts, they believe, saved the lives of hundreds of great bullfighting masters.
By the way, this, I think, very interesting porcelain work was found by me there, in Madrid, but at another time and not about this.

Although rumors of their wedding were circulating back in April, the couple officially tied the knot only now - on September 29.
According to People magazine, the private ceremony took place at the Paltrow house on Long Island.

Last year, Google paid $3 billion for this option.

In early August, Apple became the first US company to be valued at $1 trillion.
Earlier published reports show that the net profit of the corporation in the third quarter increased by 32% compared to the same period of 2017, reaching $ 11.5 billion.

Trump says he is "in love" with Kim Jong Un
From being cruel to each other, the leaders of the United States and North Korea have almost fallen in love with each other, Donald Trump joked.
US President Donald Trump has made a witty joke about his successes on the North Korean crisis front.
Starting with mutual threats of annihilation, the two countries' leaders have now so straightened their relationship that they are almost in love with each other, the American president noted.
The White House host recalled that he had accepted the North Korean problem as the main foreign policy difficulty from the previous administration.
Trump noted that Barack Obama's team had so messed up with the DPRK that they couldn't even call the DPRK leadership - they just wouldn't answer the phone.
The US and North Korea were on the brink of war, and now the North Korean leader is writing "beautiful letters" to the White House, Trump said.
Trump admitted that he had been "cruel" to Kim Jong Un in his early days, which was, by the way, mutual.
But now their relationship has improved to the point that the leaders "fall in love with each other".
Trump asked that his words not be taken literally and warned that the American media would interpret them as incompetence.
Trump drew attention to the fact that Pyongyang had recently stopped nuclear and missile tests, and was closing military sites.
All thanks to the work of his administration, the American president is convinced.
Last Tuesday, Donald Trump spoke highly of Kim Jong-un from the rostrum of the UN General Assembly.
Trump thanked the North Korean leader for his courage and the steps he has taken to de-escalate tensions.
Trump noted that sanctions against the DPRK would remain in place until the complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.
Negotiations in Singapore
On June 12th, the first ever US-North Korean leaders held talks in Singapore.

The meeting resulted in the cessation of nuclear and missile tests by the DPRK, as well as the return to the United States of the remains of American soldiers in the country.
Meanwhile, other practical steps toward denuclearising North Korea are being stalled.
Media reports said that after the Singapore summit, the US had sent the DPRK several disarmament scenarios, but Pyongyang rejected them as "gangster-like".

Nizoy called for "the Ukrainian product to replace the Moscow language"
Ukrainian children's writer and fighter for the purity of the native language Larisa Nitsoy called for the expulsion of "Russian-speaking Moscow product and the Moscow language" from Ukraine.
She suggests using a Ukrainian product - "cultural wave, cultural pressure".
She shared her thoughts about "the expediency of eradicating the Russian language in Ukraine" with the Ukrainian publication "Obzrevatel".
According to her, the corresponding Ukrainian product is now being prepared - it is already there and continues to develop further.
Over time, Ukrainians will "get over" this "Moscow language", she is convinced.
For example, in neighboring Poland, she said, Russian was widely used on television and radio, but it has practically disappeared in public space.
At the same time, according to Nitsa, Ukrainians do not use aggressive methods in this process: the actions of the authorities, prohibiting the use of the Russian language, in her opinion, are only "expanding the borders for Ukrainian speech at the legislative level".
Earlier, Nitsa shared her experience of maintaining the "Ukrainian-language regime" in a children's camp in the Carpathians, where she was invited to work.
In December 2016, she threatened to sue the Watsons bookstore chain, one of whose cashiers spoke to her in Russian.
When she didn't get her way, Nice threw a pass at the girl.
She calls the use of Russian words by Ukrainians "language schizophrenia", urging Ukrainians to abandon Russian letters even in writing surnames.
Recently, Nietzsche stated that the name "Rus" was stolen from Ukrainians, so Russia should be called Moskovia.
The anger of the writer could not be avoided even by the Security Service of Ukraine: having come there and having heard the conversations of employees with each other in Russian, she caused a scandal and left, slamming the door.
We had a man-to-man conversation during the break, and it paid off.
Defender of "Ural" Denis Kulakov - about the victory over "Arsenal" (2: 1) in the match of the ninth round of the Russian championship.
"Dennis, what do you think was the key to winning?"
"I think we wanted to win more", - quotes Kulakov official website "Ural".
"It was a difficult game, we had a serious conversation between the two of us during the break, and it paid off: we scored two goals and didn't let one go.
"You missed a few games because of an injury you sustained earlier this month.
How did you feel today?"
"If you can last 90 minutes, then you're fine!
Actually, it felt good.
Maybe a little bit of strength at the end so nothing happens.
So, the doctor and physiotherapist Vladimir Anatolievich Gashnev, they introduced me to this game, and I thank them very much!
"What do you think of the team atmosphere?"
"It's no secret that after a win, recovery is easier, and the team's mood is good.
We're now white, although we were black before.
We have to keep going and make the fans happy".
"Missed the game for the time you weren't on the field?"
"There's such a little bit of a miss, because a really, unpleasant situation came out.
But again, thank you to the physical therapist and the doctors for putting me back on my feet.
The most important thing is that we won and made the fans happy.
Everything else is secondary".

Violations in the referendum in Macedonia
Four incidents of violations of electoral legislation were registered in the Republic of Macedonia in the referendum on the intergovernmental treaty with Greece on renaming.
This was reported on Sunday by the press secretary of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, Tony Angelovsky.
Since the polling stations were opened, there have been four incidents that have been eliminated, he said.

"The Ministry will act in accordance with the law so that citizens can exercise their constitutional right to freely express their will.
We urge citizens to abide by the law and refrain from any violation of public order and peace and any violation of the secrecy of voting", said the representative of the Ministry of Interior.
Citizens are asked to answer one question in a referendum on Sunday: "Do you support EU and NATO membership by accepting the agreement between the Republic of Macedonia and the Hellenic Republic?"
The referendum is intended to resolve a 27-year dispute between Macedonia and Greece over the name of the former Yugoslav republic, which coincides with the name of the northern Greek region.
The foreign ministers of Macedonia and Greece signed an agreement on the new official name of the former Yugoslav republic on June 17 during a ceremony on the shores of Lake Prespa, which marks the border between the two countries.
It provides for the use of the name "Republic of North Macedonia".
The treaty should not only resolve the long-running dispute over the country's name, but also open the way for Skopje to join NATO and the EU.

The indictment of a Dagestan MP was news
The Soviet District Court of Makhachkala has ordered the detention of Dagestan People's Assembly deputy Rajab Abdulatipov, suspected of being involved in a criminal group that issued disability for bribery, for two months.
"Ъ" became known details of the investigation materials, shedding light on how, according to the version of the Investigative Committee of Russia, the younger brother of the former head of the republic Ramazan Abdulatipov Rajab Abdulatipov contributed to the criminal actions of the now former head of the Main Bureau of Medical and Social Expertise Magomed Makhachev and his accomplices.
Among other things, during the operational-investigative measures carried out by the Ministry of Internal Affairs, it was established that Rajab Abdulatipov lobbied for the appointment of Magomed Makhachev to the post of head of the bureau, allegedly receiving 70 million rubles for this.
Earlier, the investigation against Magomed Makhachev, other leaders and employees of the territorial bureaus of medical and social expertise under his command, was initiated by a criminal case under Art. 210 (creation of a criminal community with the use of the official position and participation in it), Art. 290 (obtaining a bribe by an organized group), Art. 292 (official fraud) and Art. 159 (fraud in a particularly large amount) of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation.
According to the investigation, at the end of 2013, Rajab Abdulatipov, knowing about the illegal actions of Magomed Makhachev and his accomplices, engaged in the theft of the Pension Fund, joined their activities, entering the criminal community.
As the head of the Federal Migration Service of Russia in Dagestan and having connections in state authorities and law enforcement agencies, as well as using his family relations with the head of Dagestan, Rajab Abdulatipov, the investigators believe, "ensured the activities of other members of the criminal community, established contacts with officials of state bodies to support the illegal activities of Magomed Makhachev and his position as head of the federal treasury institution "The Main Bureau of Medical and Social Expertise for the Republic of Dagestan", organized the illegal establishment of disabilities for citizens".
After the information was released at a Soviet district court hearing on Friday, Rajab Abdulatipov denied the charges against him.
"Of course, everything that is being brought to me today as an accusation is new to me, I am completely unfamiliar with it", he said.
The court arrested the deputy from "United Russia" not for ten days before the indictment, as it was with previous high-ranking Dagestan officials, but for two months, since in his case there is article 210 of the Russian Criminal Code.
According to the Code of Criminal Procedure, the prosecution has much longer to file charges - up to 45 days from the time of arrest.

It is specified that the said HPP is located on the territory of Kosovo, but at the same time belongs to the Serbian energy system.
Kosovo declared independence from Serbia 10 years ago, but Belgrade refused to recognize it.
Last spring, the parties broke off the negotiations on this issue.

Kosachev: Russia was virtually absent from the 73rd session of the UN General Assembly
The head of the Federation Council's Committee on International Affairs, Konstantin Kosachev, considers the 73rd session of the UN General Assembly to be a success for Russia and does not rule out that it will be a turning point in Russia's perception of Russia as an integral participant in solving global problems.
"The uniqueness of the current 73rd session, in my opinion, is that the rhetoric to which we have become almost accustomed in recent years in relation to Russia, was now much more muted", the senator said in an interview published on Sunday by the "Russian newspaper".
He explained that in previous years, Russia has been "sometimes singled out as one of the three main threats to humanity, whether alongside Ebola, climate change or terrorism, Russia was in that number, at least in the narrative of a group of Western countries that were quite unanimous on this issue".
At the 73rd session, Kosachev stressed, "there was virtually no negative Russia".
"If you carefully analyze the speech of the President of the United States, the President of France, the speech of the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Germany, I do not take Ukraine, Georgia, or the British, at least the chorus was not completely accurate", the politician noted, noting that Russia "was no longer a wall against which tennis balls are trained".
The head of the relevant committee of the Federation Council does not exclude that this indicates a trend that, in his opinion, "will highlight the current session [of the UN General Assembly], although in full this trend may be manifested in a year, in two, in three".
"I don't rule out that this session could be a turning point in some sense", Kosachev admitted, explaining that "there are too many examples of how Russia's involvement can move forward in international affairs".
He cited the situation in Syria, around Iran and North Korea as examples.
"Unfortunately, this is not Ukraine, but I have no doubt that the Russian vision of the Ukrainian crisis will also be in demand over time", the parliamentarian added.
This is due, he believes, to the emergence of "an adequate, healthy perception of Russia as not just possible - an integral participant in solving the global problems of the modern world".
"I don't want to be wrong, but I have a feeling that we are passing somewhere a point where the movement will no longer be a movement backwards, it will be a movement forward", he added.
Another "interesting and important sensation" in this context, Kosachev called "the request for a Russian vision of how the modern world should develop".
"I attended many meetings of the head of the Russian delegation [to the General Assembly session] Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, I held my own meetings, and I was very pleased to see that if a year or two or five years ago, no one was interested in the Russian opinion, the Russian vision of what is happening in the world, by and large, the situation is different now", said the chairman of the Committee of the Federation.
In his opinion, this is due to the fact that "the so-called new liberal order, which is personified with the West, does not have answers to the questions of how to solve world problems due to the apparent shortage of ideas in the global space, the shortage of ideas on how to solve the problems of the Middle East, the problem of terrorism, the problem of non-proliferation of nuclear weapons, the problem of migration".
"And here the request for a Russian vision is becoming more and more obvious", Kosachev said, emphasizing that he considers this session "successful for the work of the Russian delegation, successful for Russia".

Damascus has said it has the right to use military force in Idlib .
Damascus hopes that the Syrian province of Idlib will not have to use military force, said the head of the Foreign Ministry of the Syrian Arab Republic, Walid Muallem.
He said Syria has the right to do so.
The minister added that Turkey has the ability to quickly solve the problem of the expulsion of militants of the banned in Russia organization Jabhat an-Nusra from the demilitarized zone in Idlib, RIA Novosti reports.
The Foreign Minister also stressed that Damascus would have to resort to a military solution to the problem of the territories east of the Euphrates in the event of Kurdish separatism.
At the same time, according to Muallem, the talks with the Kurdish SDF were good until they were interrupted by the US.
On September 17, Putin and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan agreed to create a demilitarized zone along the line of contact between the armed opposition and government troops in the Syrian province of Idlib by October 15.
Terry took over the Chelsea youth team.
Earlier it was reported that the 37-year-old defender was negotiating a move to Moscow's Spartak.
RT reports, citing the Mirror, that former England captain John Terry has been appointed Chelsea's youth team captain.
According to the source, the famous player, who has been playing for the London club for a long time, will lead the team for no more than 23 years.
It is noted that the coaching staff Terry will replace Jody Morris, who left for Derby County.
In September, Terry was close to joining Spartak Moscow, but ultimately abandoned the idea after talking to his family.
First Vice-Speaker of the Verkhovna Rada Irina Gerashchenko apologized to the Russian convicted for "spying" Ukrainian journalist Roman Suschenko for the fact that he still has not been released from prison.
She said this in a video message to a political prisoner recorded on the eve of the second anniversary of Suschenko's illegal arrest by the FSB.
According to her, there is an action under the walls of the Russian Embassy in Paris these days, the participants of which have declared a hunger protest with the demand to release prisoners of the Kremlin.
Every day, French journalists, politicians, cultural figures, including people who know you well, go on hunger strike in support of Oleg Sentsov, other political prisoners in the Kremlin, and of course you.
There is not a single international meeting, nor a single negotiation, nor a single interview where the President of Ukraine, the Ukrainian authorities, all of us, did not demand to put pressure on the Kremlin, to put pressure on Putin with one demand - the release of Oleg, the release of Roman, the release of all political prisoners of the Kremlin and those guys who are illegally detained in the occupied territories of Donbass and Crimea", - said Gerashchenko.
She also expressed confidence that the trials will harden every Ukrainian, making us "tougher, tougher in defending Ukraine's national interests, in defending every Ukrainian, in understanding what is good and what is evil".
We remind, the correspondent of Ukrinform in France Roman Suschenko was detained by Russian security forces on September 30, 2016 in the Moscow airport.
On October 7, he was charged with espionage against the Main Intelligence Directorate of the Ministry of Defense of Ukraine.
On June 4, 2018, the Moscow City Court sentenced Sushchenko to 12 years in a strict regime colony, and the Supreme Court of Russia recognized this verdict as legal.
The Russian prison guards granted the Ukrainian's last request before his transfer to the colony.
NASA has announced that an asteroid the size of Big Ben is approaching Earth .
The American space agency NASA has reported that a large asteroid SP1 is approaching Earth, which can reach a length of 160 meters.
According to the Daily Express, the space object could be as long as the famous Big Ben or the London Ferris wheel.
However, there is no exact data on its size.
SP1 is traveling at about 60,000 km/h. The closest approach to Earth will be on October 3.
It will then pass our planet at a distance of 0.03926 astronomical units, or 5.87 million kilometers.
The asteroid was first spotted on September 19.
NASA has classified it as an extraterrestrial object.
Earlier on September 27, the Japanese Aerospace Research Agency released the first ever video from the surface of the Ryugu asteroid.
Two Japanese rovers (planetary rovers) launched from the Hayabusa-2 probe managed to capture unique footage.
Bast was blamed for the football pitch at the 2018 World Cup
Damage to the football pitch at the stadium in Rostov-on-Don was linked to a concert by Russian rapper Vasily Vakulenko, or Bast.
The photo was posted on the Instagram account hd7tv.
"We are very fond of Bast and his work, but... sorry about the lawn", the caption reads.
The comments claim that because of the protective coating (special tiles) the grass at the edge of the field was damaged.
The concert, scheduled for September 29, has never been canceled.
The football club "Rostov", as well as the Russian Premier League, opposed the concert.
"I would like to know the names of those players and representatives of Rostov who claim that my performance could cause damage, hinder the activities and development of the football club, as well as affect the performance of its players", Basta wrote in response to criticism.
The Rostov-Arena is one of the stadiums of the 2018 World Cup.
Five tournament matches were played on the stadium.

"I couldn't even hold a spoon"
Vakhtang Kikabidze is talking about the fight against cancer
Many artists now talk about how they have managed to cope with cancer.
The disease, unfortunately, is not without its victims, and the stories of famous people who have conquered cancer give hope to many patients.
The famous actor Vakhtang Kikabidze has admitted that he is alive only because of his wife.
Years ago, he was diagnosed with a terrible disease that sounded like a death sentence.
"I felt as if I had been hit from the bottom of my skull with a hammer.
I fell down.
I lost my bearings.
Put him in the hospital.
He couldn't hold his spoon, couldn't stand up, fell all the time.
They started running tests, and it was pretty bad, the artery's not pumping.
They brought me to Moscow, told me I had a large pustular cyst in my head, and they operated on me.
And during the operation, the doctors saw a tumor behind the cyst", Kikabidze told the program "Once".
The tumor was malignant.
Then, 37 years ago, the people of Tbilisi even came to say goodbye to the idol on the threshold of his house.
But the actor's wife did not allow him to be buried alive, she believed that she could cope with the disease and did not leave the bed of her beloved husband for more than a year.
If it wasn't for Irina, I wouldn't be alive right now.
Whenever I had a crisis, she was there like a rock", the actor admitted.
The actor managed to overcome the disease, now he lives happily in his house in the center of Tbilisi.
And from time to time, he refutes the rumors of his illness and untimely death that appear on the Internet.
The creators of the site "Peacemaker" have added to the section "Purgatory" the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Hungary, Peter Sijart.
The reason was "an attempt on the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine".
In addition, the head of the foreign Ministry of the neighboring country was found guilty of "direct threats of invasion in Ukraine" and "supporting separatist sentiments in Ukraine", as well as participation "in the organization of provocation aimed at mass violation of Ukrainian citizens of the legislation of Ukraine".
It should be noted that the vicar of the Kiev-Pechersk Lavra, Pavel, and the head of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church (Moscow Patriarchate) Onuphry were in the "Church of Purity" before Sijjarto.
The reason was their opposition to the Ukrainian local church receiving the Tomos.
Earlier, commenting on the issuing of Hungarian passports to Ukrainian citizens in the Transcarpathian region, Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko demanded respect for Ukraine's sovereign rights.
The authorities have named the amount of the "golden parachute" of the Voronezh deputy governor
The one-time payment of 23 salaries to the deputy governor of the Voronezh region Yuriy Agibalov was made on the basis of the regional law "On state positions".
The actual amount of the "golden parachute" of the dismissed official was several times less than the amount announced in the media.
This was the explanation given to the press service of the regional government.
According to the law, the salary of Agibalov is 11 189 rubles.
Thus, the press service emphasized, the amount of the one-time payment was minus income tax 223 892 rubles, not 1 million rubles, which the media wrote about.
The official had been receiving an old-age pension since July 2018.
His experience in public office is more than nine years.
The pension and lump-sum payment are made immediately after his dismissal, the regional government told RIA Novosti.
At the same time, the payment of the pension supplement to Agibalov was suspended when he was appointed to the state duty, and his salary was unchanged compared to the previous period.
The winner of the election of the governor of the governor of the region, Alexander Gusev, took office on September 15.
Agibalov was dismissed from his post due to the expiration of the term of the acting head of the region.
Similarly, the mandate of other officials who held public office in the region ended.
On September 29, the Telegram channel "Nezygar" published documents showing that Agibalov, who left the post of vice-governor, was paid a severance allowance in the amount of 23 salaries, and two days later he again received a similar position without the prefix "vryo".
State Duma deputy urged to tell schoolchildren about the harm of masturbation
Onishchenko is the first deputy chairman of the Committee on Education and Science.
Drawing on his experience, he noted in an interview that teens are being provoked to masturbate by harmful information they find on the Internet.
The fight against this is at the level of educational institutions and families, the deputy added.
Gennady Onichenko, a deputy of the State Duma of the Russian Federation (in an interview with the radio station "Speaks Moscow":
And as part of general sex education, you have to do it by explaining the downside, because there are risks that are specific to the sexual health of the child, both boys and girls.
The problem is objective, it's that children reach puberty early enough, and there's a big gap between their sexual maturity and their ability to formally engage in intersex relationships.
According to Onishchenko, the solution of the problem is hindered by "dishonesty", the silencing of "gender problems" and the lack of culture of adequate child rearing.
The doctor is sure that many teenagers have anal sex.
The MP believes that lessons on the harm of onanisms should be taught in schools in "hyperurbanized" regions.
"If we start this conversation in our Muslim republic, we will simply not be understood, to put it mildly", the professor said.
Gennady Onichenko is an active academician of the Russian Academy of Medical Sciences, a member of the Presidium of the Russian Academy of Medical Sciences, a doctor of medical sciences, a professor.
He is an honored doctor of Russia and Kyrgyzstan, a member of the presidium of the All-Russian public organization "League of the Nation Health".

"Teploset" will provide aid to the families of those who died in the burst of the pipe on Izmailovsky Avenue.
The relatives were told about this at the company immediately after the tragedy.

The ADG is the second most popular music group in Germany.
The anti-immigrant Alternative for Germany is setting another popularity record, and Angela Merkel's ratings are dropping.
Apparently, Germans are getting really tired of Angela Merkel's immigration policy, which has made the country a coveted destination for millions of refugees from the Middle East.
This is most clearly shown by the latest opinion polls, which show that the anti-immigrant Alternative for Germany party is gaining in popularity, while the ruling bloc of Merkel and Seehofer is losing ground.
This week, the ADG broke another record, climbing to the second place in the popularity ranking.
The right-wing conservatives, with 17 percent of the popular vote, managed to overtake the social democrats, who have about 16 percent.
The one percentage point gap can be blamed on a statistical error, but it is worth noting that the AfD, which was formed in 2013 by a small group of Eurosceptic economists, has managed to become a serious political force.
The leadership in the overall standings is still held by the ruling bloc of the CSU/CDU, which has about 30 percent.
However, there is a tendency to lose points - back in April, the support for Angela Merkel's bloc was four percentage points higher.
The personal rating of the German chancellor, who is heading the German government for the fourth consecutive term, is also declining.
Today, 48 percent of Germans support Angela Merkel, down 7 percent from last year.
The Social Democrats are followed by the Greens (15%), the Left (11%) and the Liberals (10%).
The evolution of the Alternative
The party "Alternative for Germany" was created in September 2012 on the basis of the group "Alternative Choice 2013", which included people from the Christian Democratic Union.
The group initially opposed the government's course, but at first only dealt with economic issues, including the problems of the euro and interaction within the EU.
The group opposed Germany's "sponsorship" of the weak EU economies, and did not rule out the possibility of a return to the Deutsche Mark and the country's complete exit from the European Union.
Amidst the deepening immigration crisis, the AdG's political platform has expanded.
In 2013, the group became a full-fledged party, which took over the niche of the Eurosceptics and began to harshly criticize the government for the failure of immigration policy.
At the last parliamentary election in 2017, the AfD managed to make its way into the Bundestag for the first time, winning 94 seats (out of 709).
Two Alternative for Germany members have won seats in the European Parliament.
Video released of journalist calling Ukrainian citizens "nation of idiots"
The host of a political talk show on Ukrainian TV, the author of two books, Ostap Drozdov, admitted on live television that he considers his compatriots to be a "nation of idiots".
They believe in television and they don't read much.
As Drodov noted, it is difficult to live and work in such a country.
"We are not taught from childhood to read and accept texts", the journalist said.
Local nationalists immediately criticized Drozdov's words, accusing him of lack of patriotism and greed.
As previously reported, the State Committee for Television and Radio Broadcasting of the Independent began to fight against literature that contains the slightest hint of criticism of the Kiev authorities, banning the import of as many as 201 publications.

Canadians have created a car for the apocalypse - The Driving Journal
Anyone can buy this car.
Roshel Defence Solutions has announced that it's now accepting applications for its new armored vehicle.
The armour of the apocalypse Roshel Senator APC
The topic of the apocalypse is not just a money-making business for video game companies, movie studios, and book publishers.
Now the automobile companies are also moving into a new niche.
So, the Canadian Roshel Defence Solutions has introduced its apocalyptic armored vehicle Senator APC.
In their spare time, the company's engineers are building armored cars for the police.
The Roshel Senator APC is designed to carry 12 passengers, who are not very comfortable, but in full safety are placed in a welded armored capsule.
This bunker, or design, is not to be named, as its armor level complies with the B7 standard, installed on the chassis of a powerful Ford Super Duty pickup.
Its bottom, also armored, is able to protect the capsule from being undermined by grenades and anti-personnel mines.
The Roshel Senator APC armored car of the apocalypse
To prevent the passengers from being injured by the blast wave from the shell that exploded near the car, the cabin is equipped with special shock-absorbing seats.
In addition, the capsule has an autonomous ventilation and fire extinguishing system.
For safe viewing, the Roshel Senator APC is equipped with a night vision camera system and an armored observation tower on the roof.
There's no weapons in the car.

To ensure that the weight of the armoured car does not affect its mobility, the Roshel Senator APC is equipped with a 330 hp 6.7 litre turbo diesel engine, all power is transferred to the four wheels of the armoured car via a 6-speed automatic transmission.
Chances of getting stuck at all in the armored car of the apocalypse Roshel Senator APC is not
The Roshel Senator APC is scheduled to be on display at the Washington, D.C. apocalypse exhibition in October.
Called the death of the universe.
The universe is still about 140 billion years old, ten times the age of the observable world, or about 13.8 billion years.
The study by an international team of scientists has been uploaded to the electronic preprint library arXiv.org and is being submitted for publication in the journal Publications of the Astronomical Society of Japan, reports the Japanese newspaper Asahi Shimbun.
The researchers came to this conclusion by observing some ten million galaxies with the Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) camera of the Subaru telescope.
By tracking the distribution of dark matter and dark energy, which account for more than 95 percent of the energy-mass of the observable world, scientists working within the standard cosmological model ΛCDM (Λ Cold Dark Matter) estimated the expansion rate of the universe, which turned out to be slightly slower than previously thought.
The Subaru Observatory press release notes that the observations have provided a detailed three-dimensional map of the distribution of matter in the universe, and the inclusion of European Planck space telescope data has clarified the limitations imposed on the ΛCDM parameters.
In July, scientists modeled a possible end of the universe.
Three years earlier, their colleagues had presented new arguments that the observable world would end in 22 billion years as a result of the Big Bang.
Another attempt to unite the pension referendum initiators has failed
The opportunity to learn the people 's opinion on the pension reform is postponed indefinitely
In Moscow on Saturday, a meeting of the federal initiative group of the referendum against raising the retirement age took place.
Representatives of 13 subgroups participated in it, registering different formulations of questions (a total of five formulations were registered by the Centri-Electoral Commission).
They decided to apply to the CEC with a petition to register a unified initiative group and ask Russians a question: "Are you in favor of not raising the age set by the pension legislation as of July 1, 2018, at which citizens of Russia are entitled to receive an old-age pension?"
This formulation was registered by the Vologda subgroup, whose representatives did not participate in the meeting, but it was considered the simplest and legally sound.
The majority of the participants of the meeting were supporters of the member of "Fair Russia" Ilya Sviridov (six subgroups) and the CPRF (four subgroups).
They were joined by three independent subgroups - from Nizhny Novgorod, Voronezh and Orenburg.
Sviridov had previously told Vedomosti that invitations had been sent to all the initiators, and about 40 sub-groups had agreed to come.
But, for example, Marina Semenova, who heads the Vologda subgroup (her formulation was supported by 15 other subgroups), told "Vedomosti" that she did not receive invitations and did not plan to come: "We did not understand who is a friend and who is an enemy".

"We have our own program that he works on.
That's why we made this decision", the club's press service quotes Billaletdinov.

In the match "Loko" - "Ahmat" errors Turbin spilled like a horn of plenty
Former all-Union category judge Vladimir Levitin commented on the work of referee Yevgeny Turbin in the match of the 9th round of the Russian championship "Lokomotiv" - "Ahmat" and analyzed the controversial episodes of the game.
- How do you rate the refereeing of Evgeny Turbin in the match "Lokomotiv" - "Ahmat"?
- I believe that this referee has confirmed his unfitness to officiate matches of the Russian Premier League.
I'm surprised that in the fifth round match between Spartak and Dynamo, neither Turbin nor the DSI officials came to any serious conclusions about his low qualifications.
The result was not slow to show in the ninth round: errors in his actions, private omissions of rough tricks came out like a cornucopia.
For example, in the 50th minute, the railwayman Eder knocks out with his hands in his penalty area the defender of "Ahmat" Rodolfo.
Eight meters from the gate, but Turbin doesn't take a penalty.
- How do you rate the episode with Idowu, who was in the 82nd minute when it seemed that the ball hit him in the hand?
- I believe there was a deliberate play of the defender's hand in his own penalty area.
Turbin was near the moment, he has a good view of the episode and his first assistant on the right.
This moment should have been seen by reserve judge Sergey Karasev.
However, all three were asleep, and no penalty was awarded.
So the score was skewed, and sports justice was violated.
That was the moment when the judging of concepts overwhelmed and buried the sporting spirit of the game.
- In the 52nd minute Turbin did not dare to remove the guest defender Oleg Ivanov, who broke the rules in the fight with Krykhovyak, and when the referee showed him a yellow card, he applauded him demonstratively.
What do you think of this episode?
Did you have to show the second mustard?
- Turbin's first yellow card was a little out of line.
The second would be illogical.
- Oleg Ivanov said after the match about the double standards of refereeing, that some teams are given penalties for such violations, as in the episode with Idov, and some are not.
What do you think of the footballer's words?
- Depends on what you mean by double standards.
There was a penalty.
They didn't give it to me.
So the referee doesn't give the second penalty to the opposing goal.
Here's the principle that's being used.
And the second thing about the double standard is that the referee watches who plays.
I played against Lokomotiv on Saturday, and Akhmat has serious complaints about Turbin's work because the team was undermined.
Matt Damon played the accused rapist Judge Kavanaugh on the SNL premiere.
American actor Matt Damon played Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, who is accused of rape.
Damon appeared in the first episode of the new season of NBC's Saturday Night Live.
In a small sketch, the actor played Kavanaugh at a Senate hearing on the rape charge.
The U.S. Supreme Court nominee earlier drew attention to his emotional depth and detail in his conversations with Senator Amy Klobuchar.
Kavanaugh has repeatedly admitted his love of beer, but has stated that he has never been drunken intoxicated.
In addition, in an attempt to exonerate himself from the rape charge, Cavanaugh claimed that he was a virgin at the time.
Damon has also been playing these moments.
I was just pretending to drink a lot and not thinking about sex at all.
I was the proudest, drunkest virgin anyone had ever seen.
Everybody knows that", said the judge, played by Matt Damon.
Kavanaugh was elected Chief Justice of the United States.
Barbra Streisand has discovered some odd behavioral patterns in her cloned dogs .
American singer Barbra Streisand has claimed that clones of her dead dog behave quite differently from the original pet.
"They're not the same.
In fact, [clones] look like her, but you can't clone a soul", the 76-year-old singer stressed.
In late 2017, Streisand ordered two clones of her 14-year-old cotton-de-tulier dog named Samantha, who had to be euthanized due to health issues.
In July 2018, it was reported that a Chihuahua named Miracle Milly, dubbed the world's smallest dog, had been cloned for the 49th time.
Scientists are trying to clone a six-year-old animal to try to understand why it is so tiny.
The US is considering a naval blockade of Russia over oil and gas supplies
The US may initiate a naval blockade of Russia to gain an advantage in the global energy market.
The US authorities are so eager to win the global market for hydrocarbons that they are ready to resort to a naval blockade of Russia, which remains one of the world's main suppliers of energy.
The possibility of a naval blockade was announced by US Interior Minister Ryan Zinke.
Contrary to world practice, the US Department of the Interior does not perform police but civilian functions, including implementing policies in the field of natural resources.
Therefore, Zinke's statement was within the purview of the department he headed, although it was not deprived of political color.
Speaking at an industry event in Pittsburgh, Zinke said that thanks to the US Navy, they control the sea lanes in the Middle East region and can block them if necessary.
Zinké suggested that the need may be due to Washington's desire to disrupt Russian supplies to the global energy market.
Zinke recalled that Russia still receives the lion's share of its revenues from the supply of oil and gas to the world market.
The desire to distribute energy supplies in the Middle East as well as in Eastern Europe was the main motive for Moscow's activation in this region, Zinke believes.
The minister made clear that the US still hopes to secure leadership in the world energy market by becoming the largest supplier of oil and gas.
To do so, Washington would have to outflank Russia and Iran, and a naval blockade of trade routes is an acceptable measure in this direction, Zinke believes.

Supersonic passenger aircraft to be put into serial production in Russia
The serial production of supersonic passenger aircraft in Russia will begin after 2030.
This was stated by the Director General of the Central Aerohydrodynamic Institute named after Zhukovsky, Kirill Sipalo.
According to him, the scientific center is working on supersonic topics both within the framework of international consortiums and cooperation with the Ministry of Industry and Trade.
"We feel that it will take us two to three years to get a technology demonstrator, and another 10-15 years to get a production car that will allow us to transport across the vastness of our homeland", Sipalo added.

Formula One Grand Prix of Russia
There's a club in Russia that I'm following.
Former captain of "Chelsea" and the England team John Terry - about why he attended the match of the ninth round of the Russian championship "Spartak" - "Rostov" (0: 1).
"In Russia, I have a club that I'm following.
I've been following him for a while now, and I was interested in seeing him from the side.
I can't say I'm a fan, because my heart belongs to Chelsea, but I have a sympathy for Spartak and I want to apologize again for the decision", Terry said, according to Chelsea's fan site.
We will remind, "Rostov" with 18 points climbed to the third place in the standings, and "Spartak" located on the fifth row, having in assets 15 points.
In the next round, the red and whites will play "Yenisei" on October 7, while Valery Karpin's team will play "Orenburg" a day earlier.
A very expensive violin was sold to a pawn shop for a lot of money .
When a man brought a violin to the LBC Boutique and Loan pawnshop in Somerville, Massachusetts, the pawnbroker offered only $50 for the apparently old and unpresentable instrument.
But experienced store manager Dylan McDermitt suspected that it was an old and expensive tool, and sought expert advice.
And it turns out that the violin was made in 1759 by the famous Italian violin maker, Ferdinando Galliano, and is valued at $250,000.
The violin fuses alone are estimated at $16,000 to $18,000.
An investigation revealed that the violin had been stolen from one of the town's residents not long ago, and the instrument had been returned to its rightful owner.
It's unclear how the violin ended up in the hands of the person who gave it to the pawnshop, but he has no previous run-ins with the law.
The manager says that now all those who bring a violin into the pawn shop will be asked to play it to make sure that it really belongs to the customer.
In the ninth round of the Russian Premier League we are facing an exciting confrontation: "Spartak" will receive at its stadium in Tushina "Rostov" under the leadership of Valery Karpin - a man, as we know, not at all alien to the "national team".
The special piqueness of this meeting is that the clubs now have the same number of points - 15 each, and they share 3 and 4 places in the standings, behind the far-left "Zenit" and being one point behind "Krasnodar", which tomorrow plays with "Dynamo".
The red-and-whites are in a difficult situation: the club is again surrounded by idiotic scandals, in the Europa League, Massimo Carrera's team unexpectedly joined "Rapid", and recently lost at home to "Ahmat".
After the derby with CSKA, which ended in a fair draw, "Spartak" with a minimal score and not without effort beat "Cherno-mores" in the Cup, and it is too early to say whether Russia's most popular club has approached the exit from the crisis.
Rostov couldn't win three games in a row, but they've lost five games in a row.
Let's see if Carpin can extend his unbeaten streak with a match like this.
The previous meeting of the Carpine "Rostov" with "Spartak" ended in favor of the capital team.
It starts at 7:00.

The storm was of magnitude 7.4, mainly affecting the island of Sulawesi, reports the TV channel "Russia 24".

London has blamed Moscow for the attacks .
Russia is trying to rewrite the Cold War, UK Defense Minister Gavin Williamson has said.
But England will defend its values, he stressed during a speech at the ruling Conservative Party's congress in Birmingham.
The threat is growing, Iran and North Korea are becoming more dangerous, the enemies are operating in the gray areas with cyber attacks and fake news, the minister added.
But the biggest of these is Russia, which is increasing its military presence in Ukraine and the Arctic region.
Moscow has repeatedly denied such statements by Western politicians, TASS reports.
At the same time, British Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt said that Russia would pay a high price if it did not abide by international rules and use chemical weapons.
Hunt mentioned the story of the poisoning in the English city of Salisbury in March of this year of ex-GRU colonel Sergei Skripal, convicted of spying for the UK, and his daughter Yulia.
The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia is holding a referendum on joining the EU and NATO, subject to a change of name.
The referendum is designed to resolve a 27-year-old dispute with neighboring Greece over the name of the country, which coincides with the name of a neighboring Greek province.
Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, a staunch supporter of renaming the republic North Macedonia, was among the first to vote.
The preparations for the referendum and today's vote are being monitored by international organizations.
The head of the observer mission of the Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights, Jan Petersen, told Euronews how the observers' work is organized:
About 100 teams were dispatched across the country today to observe the entire process, from the opening of polling stations to their closing, then the counting of votes and the drafting of protocols.
For a month, 10 of our teams were working across the country, monitoring the preparation of the vote, the work of the media, compliance with the law on campaign finance and the organization of the referendum.
Faye Dulgheri: "Around 500 foreign observers are closely monitoring the voting process.
The observation teams record the details and communicate with the election commissioners to report back in a final report".
The translator compared the mentality of Russians and Germans
The mentality of the Russian and German peoples is different, but the few differences between them do not play a big role for mutual understanding.
This was reported by professional translator-synchronist Barbel Sachse on International Translator's Day, September 30.
She has been translating from Russian and English for over 30 years.
"Germans like to plan things in a calm way, but Russians, as the saying goes, 'take a long time to plan, but go fast.'
But I think that for the understanding between the peoples and for the work of the translator, it does not play a significant role", - said the expert in a commentary to RIA Novosti.
According to the translator, "it is enough to know history" to understand that two countries cannot do without each other.
And in the future, Sachse noted, Germany has no reason to ignore Russia.
Russia is a natural part of Europe, there's no point in trying to ignore it.
We need Russian gas, oil, there are many things that determine our common destiny", she said.
A day earlier, German Chancellor Angela Merkel said that Germany was trying to "establish relations" with Russia and to support them.
She said that Berlin's obsession is the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline project, which is being built from the Russian coast to Germany along the bottom of the Baltic Sea.

Ganja complained that the parliamentarians were not compensated for their representative expenses.
After that, the State Duma said that they would consider paying the representative expenses to the deputies.
"Between Two Seas" won the Golden Shrimp at the San Sebastian Film Festival
Spanish director Isaca Lacuesta's "Between Two Seas" (Entre dos aguas) was named the best film of the 66th San Sebastian International Film Festival.
The film won the main award of the festival - "Golden shell".
Norwegian actress Pia Tjelta received the Silver Shell Award as best actress for her film Blind Spot.
The Argentine Dario Grandietti was named best actor for the film "Red" (Rojo).
The director of the same film, Benjamin Nighstadt, was awarded the title of best director.
The comedy "Evening School" topped the US box office.
The comedy "Night School", which debuted in U.S. theaters last Friday, made $28 million in its first weekend.
This result allowed a straightforward Kevin Hart/Tiffany Hadish-starring film to top the U.S. box office for September 28-30.
The film, which has only been released in 20 countries, has grossed $5.5 million internationally, including 2 million from British audiences.
In the fight for the first line, Malcolm Lee's creation, which is remarkable, quite noticeably ahead of another newcomer of the Western film - the cartoon "Smallfoot", a curious story of the acquaintance of the charming yeti with a representative of the human race, in the existence of which the main character never believed.
Directed by Cary Kirkpatrick and Jason Reiss, the film grossed $23 million in its opening weekend, generally beating the expectations of experts who had predicted the film would gross $20-25 million over the weekend.
As for the total collections of "Smallfoot", at the moment they amount to $ 38.6 million (at the same time it debuted in 50 countries): the most active here was Mexico, which replenished the film's coffers by $ 3.6 million.
The best of the best this time round was the children's fairy tale "The Secret of the House with a Clock" by the master of horror Eli Rota, which definitively proved that the director knows how to make a quality film for an audience of 12+.
In its second week at the box office, the film adaptation of John Bellairs' book starring the charming Jack Black and Kate Blanchett has earned $12.5 million, bringing its worldwide total to $53.8 million.
Despite the exit from the top 3, the "+" sign of the thriller with Blake Lively and Anna Kendrick "A Simple Request" continues to surprise: in 17 days in the American box office, the picture of Paul Fig, from which some unreal financial deeds were not expected from the word "everyone", collected $43 million (including 6.6 million for October 28-30) and right now has 62.9 million total revenue.
The last top five this week was the horror film "The Nun's Curse", which grossed $5.4 million in the reporting period.
The spinoff "The Oath" has earned $330 million in its 24 days in theaters and is the most successful film in the franchise, which also includes two parts of "The Oath" and two films about the fearsome Annabelle doll.
Right behind the horror movie of Corinne Hardy, another new entry in the genre has emerged this weekend, the debutante "Hellfest", one of the year's top youth horror films.
In its first weekend, the brainchild of acclaimed film editor (and recent film director) Gregory Plotkin, who had previously worked on a number of big horror projects, including Happy Day of Death, which Helfest is very similar to, made $5.1 million.
Considering the film's modest budget, the result is extremely positive.
Seventh place went to "Crazy Rich Asians" ($4.15 million), which does not seem to be thinking of dropping out of the top 10 of the American box office: a romantic comedy that has been on the screens for the seventh week, according to the results of September, is the sixth highest grossing film in the genre in history with an indicator of 165.7 million.
That 's how much the film has made in the domestic market - 218.8 million .
As for the last three lucky winners of the top ten in the U.S. box office for September 28-30, they are "The Predator", "White Guy Rick" and... "The Bagel", who earned $3.7 million, $2.38 million and $1.1 million respectively last weekend.
And next weekend, the long-awaited Venom with Tom Hardy will be in theaters in the U.S. It's not a stretch to say that he'll be the number one box office draw in the U.S. by the end of October.
Other premieres this week include the Venice Film Festival winner Bradley Cooper's musical melodrama A Star Is Born and the crime drama Your Hate.

But I'll take the fall for it anyway.
Because they seem to have missed something in the preparation.
It was a different team from the last game".
"This is a disgusting sorcery".
The audience is outraged by Agutin's choice for the Voice show.
Viewers of the show "Voice 60+" accuse the mentor Leonid Agutin of "grossly impersonating and brazenly tampering".
When he recognized the voice of his father Nikolai Agutina from the first notes in the blind auditions, many hoped that he would maintain neutrality and not turn to the performer.
But his filial feelings got the better of him, and he chose a relative to be on his team.
At the time, many thought it was a joke, but they forgave the teacher for being biased in the first place.
But the "joke" dragged on, and the star's father was unnecessarily replaced by more worthy performers.
And now the audience is not ready to forgive Agutina for such injustice.
Yesterday, we, the audience, were outraged by the brothel's indecent and frank dragging of their loved ones up the final stairs.
I even doubted that Agutina would have the strength and conscience not to drag her father to the end to the first place", - said Irina Petrovskaya and Ksenia Larina in the program "The Man from TV".
Meanwhile, for his father's sake, Leonid Agutin "spoiled" the beautiful performers who really sang, while Nikolai Petrovich whispered a touching song about his mother, explaining it by what the audience still wants to see in his father's show.
But it turns out that's not the case, that the audience wants an objective evaluation and to see really talented performers in the final, and now Agutin has discredited the show.
"My condolences to the Voice team members of Agutin - they were doomed".
"Last time Agutin showed how much he loves his dad, and today he had to show himself to be a professional".
"The contest has lost its meaning".
"To remove two talented people from the project and leave your dad who doesn't sing but whispers, what do you call a mentor after that?"
"If you like how your father sings, give him a concert in the Kremlin with your money and see how many people come to this concert".
This is The Voice, not The Cousins.
"It was unprofessional on Agutin's part".
"Then you should ask your dad to do your own show, not a show that Channel 1 is paying for".
"It was a real opportunity for someone, and he took someone's place.
And I don't understand why a voiceless dad should make more sense to me than any other contestant with real vocal talent.
Why did the worker from Surgut with a great voice and timbre get drained, and Agutin's dad got to the final?
And then we all complain that we've been on the stage and on the screen for decades with the same faces!
Because you can't get through the stepfatherhood!"
"What were you waiting for?
This is Russia!
All around the mud and the puppets.
And the money will be in the family budget!
The theater of the absurd continues!
Users also remembered that in one of the seasons of the traditional "Voice" on the blind auditions came the son of Gradsky.
I never thought to bring my son to my own team.
He actually said, "Go on, get out of here, all right?"
Agutin couldn't act like a pro.

Russia will start to fine for violations in the field of share construction
From tomorrow, Russia will start to fine for violations in the field of share construction, reports the channel "Russia 24".
Companies and officials are threatened with punishment if they do not submit the data on the building in time to the Unified Information System for Housing Construction.
The innovation will help those who decide to buy a new apartment in a new building, but are afraid of the bankruptcy of the developer.
This was discussed at a conference in St. Petersburg for representatives of the construction industry.
The amendments to the share-based construction law will force developers to take out full bank credit.
And many experts have already been talking about the potential for a big rise in the price of apartments.
But as it turns out, not everyone agrees.
In the center of Kiev, a robber threatened a man with a knife, forcing him to withdraw money from an ATM.
The incident occurred on the evening of September 29 on Ivan Kudri Street, according to the capital's law enforcement officials.
According to the victim, the unknown man approached him and started a conversation, but then suddenly pulled out a knife and demanded money and a mobile phone.
Since the victim did not have cash, the stranger ordered to withdraw money from the bank card.
After the attacker received 4 thousand hryvnia and a phone, he hit the victim and fled", the report says.
Police managed to arrest the robber, a 25-year-old from Kiev.
He's now facing up to seven years in prison.
Police are also working on the possibility that the attacker was involved in other similar crimes.
Let me remind you that there were several high-profile robberies of cash registers in Odessa the day before.
In one case, armed robbers were caught by drone.
Scientist talks about possible scientific program of Russian expedition to the Moon
The head of the Institute of Space Research of the Russian Academy of Sciences, corresponding member of the Russian Academy of Sciences Anatoly Petrukovich told RIA Novosti about a possible program of scientific research for Russian cosmonauts on the Moon.
He said that the scientific community is currently working on the development of such directions.
"There is no consolidated opinion yet", he said.
He noted that one option would be to place a low-frequency radio telescope on the far side of the moon, which would avoid interference from Earth.
"This is the only place where such a telescope can be deployed for the study of cosmic sources of radio radiation", added Petruković.
He also thinks the moon could be used for robotics testing, for building on local resources.
He also believes that astronauts should be involved in the search for primitive organisms on Earth's moon.
This could help us determine how life emerges on planets.
Earlier, the head of the Roscosmos Corporation said that in an optimistic scenario, the Russian Federation could carry out a manned flight to the Moon by 2030.
A disgruntled customer dumped a basket of feces at a 7-Eleven.
Damian Simms, a 41-year-old resident of St. Petersburg, Florida, allegedly had a "tooth" for the manager of the 7-Eleven chain, which kicked him out of the store in May for inappropriate behavior.
And decided to take revenge on his enemy in an original way.
At two in the morning, he went to the store and threw the contents of a basket he had brought with him on the floor and on some of the goods on the shelves.
The basket contained feces and urine that Simms had "borrowed" from a nearby mobile bio-toilet.
Police officers arrived at the scene and arrested the "avenger".
He was taken into custody and released on $300 bail pending trial.
He was charged with trespassing and criminal trespass, and was forbidden to enter the store or approach the manager.
Although Simms' crime looks more ridiculous than serious, the sentence could be severe, since he has a history of serious misdemeanor theft, robbery, illegal possession of firearms, driving while intoxicated, and animal cruelty.
In the US named the most fearsome submarine of Russia
The most formidable enemy submarine for the U.S. Navy will be the Russian submarine Kazan of the Yasen-M project, writes The National Interest.
The submarine was launched in March 2017, but the Navy will receive it in 2019.
According to the publication, even the predecessor of the "Kazan" submarine "Severodvinsk" received high praise from the American military.
We're going up against a tough potential opponent.
"It is enough to take a look at the Severodvinsk", The National Interest quotes Rear Admiral Dave Johnson as saying.
The United States, however, maintains its lead over Russia in this industry.
The multi-purpose nuclear submarines "Kazan", "Novosibirsk", "Krasnoyarsk" and "Arkhangelsk" are being built according to the improved project "Yasen-M" (885M).
They have a displacement of 13 800 tons, a depth of diving of 520 meters, a crew of 64 people, an autonomy of 100 days, a subsea speed of 31 knots.
The submarines are armed with mines, 533 mm torpedoes, Onyx and Calibre cruise missiles.
In August, the press office of the U.S. 6th Fleet stated that the U.S. submarine force remains "the most powerful and formidable on the planet".
German politicians ignored the opening of the mosque because of Erdogan
The Prime Minister of the federal state of North Rhine-Westphalia Armin Laschet and the Ober-Burgmeister of Cologne, Henrietta Reker, ignored the opening ceremony of the new city mosque.
Deutsche Welle is reporting on it.
The event was attended by Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
Lashet met Erdogan at Cologne airport, but refused to go to the mosque, saying the event could become "an extremely politicized event".
Recker said she received an unofficial invitation on the eve of the opening, Friday, September 28.
According to her spokesperson, such a proposal should be considered as belated and not serious.
Speaking in the square in front of the mosque, Erdogan summed up his two-day visit to Germany.
The president called them successful, saying he had met with German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier and Chancellor Angela Merkel, with whom he discussed, among other things, the fight against racism and Islamophobia.
The new mosque in Cologne is one of the largest in Europe, with a capacity of about 1,100 worshippers.
The construction cost 30 million euros, financed by the Turkish side.
In Ivanov, you can become a diver, speleologist or mountaineer.
The course will be run by the Salvation Club, located in the regional centre.
However, the club's activities are not limited to these three interesting professions - the numerous courses and seminars also offer the opportunity to learn sailing, disaster medicine, parachute training, and basic psychology.
Moreover, the knowledge that the students receive is not only theoretical - the club's program also includes the practical collection.
More details can be found at the Moscow State Technical University on October 8 (Monday) at 19:30 in auditorium 201 (B building) and at the Moscow State Economic University on October 10 (Wednesday) at 19:30 in auditorium B-516.

You can tell that these guys have a lot of psychological burden.
They're in a hurry to finish the attacks, so it's not working.
After a while, you just have to move on.
- How do you like the game of Erofeev?
- You know, I really enjoyed the game.
Emotional, nothing too much, just like we asked.
He climbed up on the goal and created moments, like in the episode with Vitaly Kravtsov, when he didn't score in the empty goal.
For the first game, I was very impressed.
I think we'll keep him in the game.

The SBU has identified and detained the owner of a Peugeot 301 car, which was traveling around the capital with the license plates of the so-called "DNR".
He turned out to be a former employee of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Ukraine, who currently works as an agent for one of the insurance companies of Ukraine.
According to the press center of the SBU, the detainee explained that the car was wanted by Interpol since 2014, which was why he was detained on the territory of Russia and handed over to him as a representative of an insurance company.

According to him, he did this "to ensure compliance with the registration car numbers of the package of documents for the specified car issued by Russian representatives of Interpol, in case of stopping the vehicle for inspection by Ukrainian police officers".
"A set of measures is currently being implemented to verify the explanations provided, as well as to establish his possible involvement in terrorist activities", the SBU said.
It should be noted that in Ukraine the use of numbers issued by terrorists in the territories of Donbass, occupied by them, is prohibited.
By the way, earlier a car with similar numbers in Mariupol was seen by an employee of the State Border Service.

The US has announced a possible naval blockade of Russia
The United States can impose a naval blockade on Russia if necessary to prevent its supply of energy to the Middle East.
This was stated by the US Secretary of the Interior, Ryan Zinke.
Speaking at an industrial event in the American city of Pittsburgh, the head of the department said that the only source of income for the Russian economy is the sale of energy and Moscow is pursuing an active policy in the Middle East to sell oil and gas there, as it does in Europe, writes the Washington Examiner.
Zinke also noted that a similar situation exists with Iran.
The minister believes there are two possible outcomes: military and economic.
The first one he would prefer not to use, so we need to put pressure and force out the Iranian energy resources.

I couldn't do anything, and it was very painful.
Sergey Sirotkin: I couldn't do anything, and it was very painful.
Russian Williams driver Sergey Sirotkin commented on the results of the Russian Grand Prix race.
"To be honest, I don't really like to talk about what's in my head.
I had a good start, and in the second corner I was caught between two cars, and they squeezed me right in.
I lost all the positions I had at the start, the moment, right away.
He's in a very bad position.
I got stuck in traffic.
We were hoping that after the rest of the guys hit the pit stop, we'd get to the clean air, and we'd get back to the rhythm, but the tires were gone.
Plus, he was fighting with a partner, and he was in contact with him.
I understand he made a slight mistake.
We were in a situation where we were on the most unruly track of the season, and there was nothing I could do, and it was very painful, to be honest.
I don't want to talk about it anymore", Orotkin was quoted as saying by RIA Novosti.
Sirotkin finished 18th in the Russian Grand Prix, the winner was British Mercedes driver Lewis Hamilton.
Tarpishev called the removal of Glushakov and Yeschenko from the foundation of "Spartak" absurd.
Russian Tennis Federation (RTF) President Shamil Tarpishchev has commented on the suspension of Moscow's Spartak players Denis Glushakov and Andrei Yeshchenko from training with the main squad after liking criticism of the team's head coach Massimore Karra, reports Sportweekend.
Carrera's actions were completely absurd.
It's a world of stupidity to pay attention to such things.
I don't agree with what Carrera's doing.
It only deepens the division in the team.
First of all, it's poetry, and you can read it and interpret it any way you want.
I wouldn't react to that if I were Carrera.
Everybody has an opinion.
Second, everyone wants to be buried.
If Glushakov and Yashchenko are liking it, it doesn't mean they have something against the coach.
I think the Italian lacks the flexibility to take a situation.
And it doesn't serve the normal team climate.
Spartacus is out of action today, so there was no need to make a big deal out of it.
Maybe we should have a laugh about it.
"Spartacus" has a lot wrong in different lines, there is a lack of play after the introduction of the youth.
The relationship within the team, apparently, does not add optimism to this match", - said Tarpishchev.
The two teams will play on September 30 and will begin at 19:00 Moscow time.
John Terry, who had previously turned down Spartak, was appointed Chelsea's youth team manager.
Sirius students discussed nature-like technology with scientists
The students of the educational center "Sirius" in Sochi, participants of the School of Agrobiology and Plant Genetics, attended a lecture by scientists of the national research center "Kurchatov Institute".
The researchers' speech was held as part of the program of the Global International Forum of Convergent and Nature-like Technologies, organized in Sochi on behalf of Russian President Vladimir Putin, according to the website of the educational center on September 29.
The lecture was opened by the documentary film "Kurchatov's Codes", during which the president of the Kurchatov Institute, correspondent member of the Russian Academy of Sciences, Mikhail Kovalchuk, spoke about global challenges as the driving force of the development of civilization.
The scientist's lecture is published on the website of "Sirius".
The students learned that modern technology requires a huge amount of energy.
Alternative energy is not yet able to produce such volumes.
The problem, according to the organizers of the forum, can be solved by nature-like technologies, which are being developed by young scientists.
In addition, Kovalchuk raised the issue of responsibility for the development of nature-like technologies, and also spoke about the risks that inevitably arise when creating such technologies.
"The arrival of such technologies is a unique thing, it's a tremendous asset.
It's the explosion of medical technology, it's the improvement of the quality of life and infrastructure.
But there's a second side.
The development of nature-like technologies is actually the technological reproduction of living nature systems.
There's the reverse side, which is deliberate interference with human life.
There are always risks.
A car came along, and people started dying under the wheels.
But cars are still used.
The dual nature of technology at once.
I'm creating a new medical technology, and at the same time I can create weapons of mass destruction", REN TV quotes the scientist.
After viewing the film and discussing the latest scientific breakthroughs, the students were able to ask questions to the participants.
The role of speakers was played by the candidate of physics and mathematics, the head of the Kurchatov complex of NBIKS-natural technologies of the NIC "Kurchatov Institute" Yulia Dyakova and the head of the Kurchatov complex of NBIKS-technologies Vyacheslav Demin.
The Sirius Education Center in Sochi was created by the "Talent and Success" educational foundation on the basis of the Olympic infrastructure on the initiative of Russian President Vladimir Putin.
The aim of the work of the educational centre is to identify, develop and further support gifted children at an early stage.
Earlier in September, it was reported that the winners of the all-Russian Cyber-Challenge online information security competition would be sent to Sirius for training.
An air traffic controller risked his life to save a plane during an earthquake in Indonesia

Russian submarine "Kazan" scared the US
The greatest threat to the U.S. Navy is the Russian submarine Kazan.
This was stated by US Rear Admiral Dave Johnson, reports "Rosbalt" with reference to The National Interest.
"We are faced with a severe potential adversary.
It is enough to look at "Severodvinsk"", - he said, pointing to the model-predecessor of "Kazan".
According to the commander of the U.S. Navy in Europe, James Foggo, Russia has focused on modernizing its submarine fleet.
Macedonia: referendum not held due to low turnout
The referendum was called to approve the agreement between the authorities in Athens and Skopje to rename the Balkan country "North Macedonia".
Greece objected to the Macedonians' use of the name of their historical province.
The renaming promised the former Yugoslav republic a path to NATO and later to the EU.
But according to Efe, only 34% of those who turned out for the plebiscite on Sunday "failed" to reach the constitutional threshold of 50%.
However, since the referendum was only advisory, it is possible that the authorities in Skopje will decide not to refuse the renaming.
Speaking shortly after the polls closed, Macedonia's Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, a proponent of changing the republic's name, said that if more "yes" votes were cast, Macedonia would change its name, despite the lack of a quorum.

Kemerovchan has raised a flock of sheep at the cemetery .
On September 30, a message from a witness appeared on Kemerov's well-known social network page about a local cemetery where horned animals were roaming freely.
A large herd of animals passed between the fences and dug up the grass.
Commentators have expressed different opinions: one local resident noted that there is no harm in the presence of small cattle in the cemetery, and their appetite can even help to clear the area of weeds and weeds, but some of the city's residents did not like the behavior of the animals:
"This is a graveyard, not a pasture.
There's nothing for the sheep to do.
Of course, you can't say that they are blasphemous about the rams, but that's not the case". (The style is preserved) - noted in her message the indignant Kemerovka.
Anyway, one of the witnesses said that the problem of the animals in the middle of the cemetery is known and will be taken care of soon.
Push and pull, how's that?
There's no such thing as "drive".
Right, to get it.
The word "press" in the sense of "to weigh, to influence, to affect" exists only phonetically, because we hear the sound [a] instead of [o] in the word "press".
We use this word, thinking it comes from the word "pressure".
But "pressure" and "to care for" are not only etymologically distant, but in some ways they are even opposites.
You'll have to see for yourself.
To bring (Church.-book, obsolete) means "enough, full, enough, to be sufficient for someone or something, to satisfy".
Pleasure, pleasure, are related words.
It used to have the meaning of "not dependent on anything, having a self-sufficient meaning" - "doing for yourself".
The Old Slavic word for "will" is related to the words for "command" and "will".
To beat, to crush is another.
These words have some really scary "relatives": daos, "wolf" (throwing sheep), deyja, "die", and dvaidī, "pressure".
The similar phonetic appearance of the words "pressure" and "to finish", as well as the inevitable obsolescence of the latter, forced them to enter into contamination.
So we have this very "d[a]velte" that is also used in writing through "a", which is, well, wrong and impossible in terms of the processes of origination and development of these words.
So, the right thing to do is to get it.
But it's an obsolete word, no longer used in its proper sense.
If you want to point out that any circumstances/people are having a negative effect on you from above, use the word "pressure".
You can also use the "exert pressure" construction, but remember, this is a clerical office.

Russian bailiffs demanded a debt from a dead old woman
In Kurgan, the bailiffs demanded that a long-dead woman pay a state duty in the amount of 200 rubles.
This is reported by the Ural Meridian.
In mid-September, relatives of the deceased Maria Mitrofanovna Slepneva received a letter from the Kurgan department of judicial adjudicators, in which it was reported that an executive proceeding had been initiated against the 105-year-old woman.
The court ordered the woman to pay 200 rubles to the local tax office.
After receiving the letter, Slepneva's relatives turned to the department for explanations.
The DA's office promised to take care of the situation.
Social media users advised the relatives to file counter-suits for non-payment of pensions and social benefits to the old woman for the years "lived" after her death.
In 2016, a court in Kemerovo recognized a man alive who was considered dead by the documents.
The death certificate was supposed to be in his full name, but it was mistakenly written to the wrong person.

With the help of the operation in Syria, Russia has protected itself from terrorists.
In the three years of the Russian military operation in Syria, about 100 thousand terrorists were killed, of which 85 thousand terrorists were destroyed by the Russian Air Force.
This was announced by the former head of the Supreme Commander of the Russian Air Force, Viktor Bondarev, head of the Federation Council Committee on Defense and Security, on the third anniversary of the start of the Russian military operation in Syria.
He noted the high accuracy of the use of air strikes: the Aerospace Forces have struck and continue to strike all the strikes precisely on the targets of terrorists.
According to Bondarev, tens of thousands of terrorist facilities have been destroyed in Syria over the past three years - for example, ammunition depots, strongholds and headquarters.
Russian airstrikes have broken through the jihadists' defenses, making a decisive contribution to the advance of Syrian government troops, Interfax reports.
At the same time, according to Bondarev, the operation of our military in Syria allowed to protect Russia itself from terrorists, many of whom had Russian passports.
At the start of the operation in Syria, more than two-thirds of the Arab Republic was under the control of terrorist groups, including the Islamic State (IS, banned in Russia) and Jabhat al-Nusra (banned in Russia).
According to the General Staff of the Russian Armed Forces, about four thousand militants from among Russian citizens and about five thousand citizens of post-Soviet countries fought on the side of the Islamic State, reports TASS.
And we are talking only about the registered persons, not counting those who were not identified, emphasized Bondarev.
Most of them were trained and ready to take up arms at any moment, and their Russian passports gave them the right to enter our country freely.
Thus, noted Bondarev, in Syria, Russia is fighting international terrorism on distant fronts - otherwise this evil "would have come to us".

Syria accused the US of supporting terrorism
Syrian Foreign Minister Walid Moallem accused the US and its partners of war crimes in Syria and supporting terrorism.
The [Western] coalition completely destroyed the Syrian city of Raqqa, it destroyed infrastructure and public services in the areas it was directed against, it committed mass killings of civilians, including children and women.
These killings are war crimes under international law", he said.
According to Muallem, the US and its partners have been "directly supporting terrorists" because the militants and the western coalition's goals in Syria coincided and meant "sowing chaos, death and destruction in their path".
The Foreign Minister also noted that the fight against terrorists in Syria is almost completed, and the country has become more secure and stable.
Mouallem added that Damascus also intends to clear Syria of illegal foreign presence, and that priority in the country's reconstruction will be given to Syrian partners.
In September, the head of the Russian Center for Reconciliation of the Republic, Lieutenant General Vladimir Savchenko, said that two American F-15 aircraft had struck the Syrian province of Deir ez-Zor with banned phosphorus munitions.
The U.S. has denied all charges.
Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko believes that while respecting the sovereignty of other states, Ukraine has the right to demand the same respect for its own sovereignty.
The head of state said this during a trip to the Kharkiv region, commenting on the issuance of passports by Hungary in Transcarpathia.
By defending Ukrainian citizens, I am defending the sovereignty of our state.
Just as we respect the sovereignty of other states, we demand the same respect for Ukraine", Poroshenko stressed.
Poroshenko said that as president, he would protect Ukrainian citizens wherever they are, whether in the east or west of the country.
At the same time, the head of state supported the position of the Foreign Ministry in the passport scandal with Hungary, which intends to expel the consul of this country from the Coast.
"I fully agree with every letter that the Foreign Ministry has said", the President noted.
As FACTS reported, a video appeared on the Internet on September 19 showing the moment when Ukrainian citizens were issued Hungarian passports at the Hungarian Consulate in Beregovo.
They also took an oath of allegiance to Hungary.
Ukrainian Foreign Minister Pavel Klimkin noted that the Hungarian consul, who appears in the video of the distribution of Hungarian passports to Ukrainians, must leave the territory of Ukraine either by the decision of Budapest itself, or be expelled by Kiev.
It also became known that the Prosecutor's Office of the Transcarpathian region opened a criminal case on the fact of issuing passports to Hungary.

Putin has flown secretly to Siberia.
It is known that Vladimir Putin spent the last two days in Dushanbe, where he took part in the work of the Council of the CIS States, as well as held a number of bilateral meetings with the presidents of neighboring countries.
Flightradar's flight data for Russian "bort No. 1" shows that around 6 p.m. Tajikistan time on September 28, the IL-96−300 took off from Dushanbe airport and headed northeast.

According to the agency "Baikal24", the President in Abakan on the night of September 29 met the head of the region personally Victor Zimin.
According to unofficial information, Putin flew to the republic to spend the weekend, but the site's sources believe that the real reason is "the problem of the second round".
Next Sunday, the second round of elections for the head of the region will be held in Khakassia.
It was formed by Valentin Konovalov (KPRF) and the current head of the republic Viktor Zimin ("United Russia").
However, on September 21, Zimin withdrew his candidacy.
Andrei Filyagin ("Just Russia") is expected to take part in the upcoming tour together with Konovalov.
Khakass media suggest that Putin may accept the resignation of the head of Khakassia and appoint a new acting head of the republic, as well as make a decision regarding the fate of Zimin.
Putin visited Khakassia in January this year.
Along with Tuva, this republic is one of the president's favorite places to relax.
More than 10 million Syrians have become refugees since the beginning of the armed conflict in Syria, which has lasted seven years.
Some five million people fled to other countries, primarily to neighboring Turkey, Lebanon, and Jordan.

Syrian Foreign Minister Walid al-Muallem said in a speech at the United Nations: "The situation on the ground is now more stable and secure, thanks to the successes achieved in the fight against terrorism.
The government continues to rebuild the areas destroyed by terrorists, bringing them back to normal life.
All conditions are in place for Syrian refugees to return voluntarily to a country they had to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic sanctions that have made life difficult for people and deprived them of their livelihoods.
The Syrian authorities have also called on the international community to facilitate the return of refugees and allocate funds for this.
Meanwhile, the US and EU countries refuse to provide assistance to Syria, stating that a political solution to the conflict must first be found.

Thus, the leadership of the concern has recently changed again, and a large-scale restructuring and fundamental changes in the management system have been announced.
Moreover, Volkswagen is promising to buy even new cars if German cities ban diesel cars on their streets: the right to do so was granted by the authorities in February of this year.

Metropolitan Ilarion compared the decision of Kiev to rename the UOC with the actions of fascists
The head of the Synodal Department of External Church Relations of the Russian Orthodox Church, Metropolitan Hilarion, compared the renaming of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of the Moscow Patriarchate to the Russian Church in Ukraine with the actions of fascists against Jews.
"It is like in fascist Germany to put a yellow pointed star on a Jew, it means to label the Church as an enemy organization, and it is for this purpose that this bill was created", the metropolitan said on the air of the Russia-24 television channel (quoted by Interfax).
In his opinion, this step will have the most serious consequences now, when the Russian-Ukrainian conflict is in an acute stage.
Kiev thus hopes to gain full control of the UOC and "to make it illegal", the clergyman believes.
"This is the Ukrainian church, and the believers of this church consider themselves Ukrainians, they are patriots of their country", he added.
Earlier it became known that the deputies of the Verkhovna Rada are working on the implementation of draft laws No. 4128 (on changing the subordination of religious communities), No. 4511 (on the special status of religious organizations) and No. 5309 (on changing the name of religious organizations).
The latter suggests renaming the UOC of the Moscow Patriarchate.
Deputy of Pochaev Lavra called for protection of Orthodoxy and Ukrainian shrines
The deputy of the Holy-Dorothy Pochaev Lavra, Metropolitan Vladimir, called for the protection of the Orthodox faith and Ukrainian shrines.
The text of his appeal to believers of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church (UOC) was published on the site of the monastery on Saturday.
At various times in history, our ancestors and fellow believers have had to defend their faith and their holy places.
Given the situation that has developed, and the information we have, and the threats of executions that are spreading, it seems that we will have to live through something", the metropolitan said.
He asked for support, prayer, moral.
The deputy laureate also stressed that it was likely "your physical presence would be needed".
The priest added: "Lenin's grandchildren are in the spirit of the threat of execution, so we will defend our sanctuary".
Who cares about the fate of the Pochaev Lavra - the Orthodox Ukrainian and world-wide shrine, we must be ready to protect it, the appeal says.
The Metropolitan urged not to give in to those who lead the faithful astray.
The UOC has a canonical status, defined by the Tomos of 29 October 1990 from the Mother Church.
And now someone wants to bring in the new patriarch and friend of the Catholic Pope of Rome, Bartholomew.
The new style and its consequences are unacceptable to us Orthodox.
And we are satisfied with the status of our church", said the governor of the laurel.
He recalled that the UOC has been canonically independent and fully self-governing since October 1990.
There is no administrative-financial accountability of the Moscow Patriarchate.
Actually, our church already has a Tomos.
What other Tomos do we need?" - Metropolitan Vladimir Pochaevsky noted, calling on believers and all citizens to ask themselves whether other confessions have Tomos, are they independent of the Vatican?
The believers had some sort of understanding and determination as to which temple they should go to.
However, some want to sow new hatred and strife.
Some are envious of the shining domes of the temples they want to destroy", the priest stressed.
The Pochay Lavra is the largest temple complex and monastery in Western Ukraine.
The laurel is located on the top of Pochayevskaya Mountain, 70 kilometers from Ternopil.
The first historical records of it date back to the beginning of the XIII century.

He decided to donate all the money to charity.

"The game was good, interesting, although it went to the goal" - quotes Vorobyov official website "Automobilista".
"We tried to play very simple.
I really liked the first period.
Missed a few good moments.
In the second half, we were a little bit under pressure, but we held up.
But the removal has fed us a little.
The guys played great, they did the coaching.
I think if we keep playing this right, we'll win.
No goals, no goals, no game, but the game was right.
Luck will come if we keep playing in this direction".
"Do you think Automobile has gained compared to the meeting in Nizhny Novgorod?"
"There was no foreign team.
In the preseason, the teams were doing other things, and there were a lot of young guys playing.
I think it was a completely different game, a different hockey.
The Automobile Club is a good, good team.
The table shows that the team is playing well.
Good hockey, good atmosphere in the arena and in the city.
We can only wish them luck.
The team is moving in the right direction.
There's a lot of good players, there's leaders.
Good defense, good goalkeeper.
It was hard, we were preparing.
We knew the team was going undefeated, we wanted to break it, but we couldn't".
Every Kalmykia resident is a debtor .
Residents of the republic increasingly visit the official website of the Federal Service of the Russian judicial officers for the Republic of Kazakhstan.

The main Macedonian oppositionist refused to vote in the referendum
In Macedonia, a referendum on the issue of an intergovernmental treaty with Greece on renaming the Republic of Macedonia will be held on Sunday, September 30.
Citizens are asked to answer one question: "Do you support membership in the EU and NATO by accepting the agreement between the Republic of Macedonia and the Hellenic Republic?"
However, the leader of the leading opposition party, Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization - Democratic Party for Macedonian National Unity (IMRO-DPMNE), Christian Mitskoski, said that he would not vote in the referendum.
As the party's press secretary Naum Stoilkovsky explained, Mitskowski decided to abstain from voting to express his disagreement with the treaty, which he considers "pernicious".
According to the spokesman, the current referendum is about renaming the country and nothing more, while the party's strategic goal is to achieve membership in NATO and the EU.
A week ago, Macedonian President Georgi Ivanov also refused to participate in the September 30 referendum.
He explained that the name for the country he chose 27 years ago in the independence referendum. The Macedonian leader considers the renaming of the country a negative factor.
"A new semi-sovereign state with a new name is being created", Ivanov said.
The agreement on the new official name of the former Yugoslav republic - the Republic of North Macedonia - was signed by the foreign ministers of Macedonia and Greece on June 17 this year during a ceremony on the shore of Lake Prespa, which marks the border between the two countries.
The agreement should resolve the long-standing dispute over the country's name, as well as Skopje's path to NATO and the EU, TASS reminds.

The US is helping Afghanistan grow opiate production
The sharp escalation of the situation in Afghanistan on September 26 was widely discussed in Tehran.
There were multilateral consultations with Iran, India, China, Afghanistan and Russia, represented by the Secretary of the Security Council Nikolai Patrushev.
In fact, in the territory of Afghanistan, the militants have unleashed a real terrorist war against the organs of state power and the civilian population of the country.
This year has become a record for the number of bloody terrorist attacks, which killed thousands of ordinary Afghans", Patrushev said.
The trouble in Afghanistan did not start yesterday.
After the September 11, 2001 attacks, the main enemy of the United States was declared the terrorist group "Al-Qaeda" (banned in the Russian Federation), established in Afghanistan.
It was less than a month ago that America and its NATO allies launched Operation Enduring Freedom.
It's been 17 years.
Thousands of American troops are still on Afghan soil.
And the world is even more ghostly than it was then.
American troops are being driven from dozens of bases.
They're buying off the militants for money, just so they don't get hurt.
The Afghan government controls a smaller portion of the country - 40 percent, according to Patrushev.
50% is the Taliban (banned in Russia).
Another 10% is for ISIS terrorists (banned in Russia).
But they're growing up fast.
The goal is to create a barbaric pseudo-caliphate in Central Asia - exactly what they failed to do in Iraq and Syria.
America, it seems, is fine with that.
And it's good to know that in the 17 years of American presence, the production of opiates in Afghanistan has increased at least 40 times.
Massive growth in the area planted with opium poppy and multi-billion-dollar profits.
Macedonians are preparing to vote in a referendum on joining the EU and NATO, with the country's name changed.
The agreement to rename the former Yugoslav republic of Macedonia to the Republic of North Macedonia was reached on 17 June as a result of long negotiations with neighboring Greece, which refused to recognize the right of its northern neighbor to be called Macedonia, seeing in such a name an attempt on the same name Greek province and Greek history.
Lupko Petkovski, political scientist: "Thanks to this agreement, Macedonia or North Macedonia gets the right to a better future, the hope for social change.
And Greece will claim its right to the past.
There are no perfect agreements.
They are the result of difficult compromises that cannot make everyone happy".
The ruling Social Democrats led by Prime Minister Zoran Zaev are in favor of renaming the country.
Opposition is the conservative opposition and the country's President, Georgi Ivanov.
According to journalist Tsvetin Chilimanov, Macedonia has no sense to join the EU - it is enough to have partnership relations with it: "Many of those who do not like the agreement believe that the current socialist government headed by Zaev is imposed from outside to change the name of the country.
But this decision will have negative consequences.
First of all, the loss of sovereignty.
It is obvious that there are countries that would not want Macedonia to remain one of the sovereign countries in the Balkans".
Fey Dülgeri, Euronews: "The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia is facing the biggest challenge in its history.
The country is at a crossroads.
The choice that the citizens of Macedonia make will determine the future not only of the Balkans, but of Europe as a whole".
