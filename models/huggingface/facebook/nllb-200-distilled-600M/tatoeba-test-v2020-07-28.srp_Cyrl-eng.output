There is not one of you who dares to write his honest opinion, and if he did write it, he would already know in advance that it would never appear in the press. I have been paid my regular salary to keep my honest opinion outside the newspapers I work for. Many of you are similarly paid for similar things, and anyone who would be so crazy to write what he honestly thinks would allow himself out in the streets, looking for some other job. If I had let my right opinion appear only once in the newspaper I work for, I would have been fired from our job in less than 24 hours. (...)
