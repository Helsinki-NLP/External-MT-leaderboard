In addition to confirming that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, which is already a generally accepted theory, this also gives us details that fossils in principle cannot, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists say that the animal's feathers were a greyish-brown color on the upper surface and pale or cartenoid on the underside.
This discovery also provides insight into the evolution of feathers in birds.
Because dinosaur feathers lack a well-developed axis, called a rachis, but have other features of feathers  spines and spines  researchers have concluded that the rachis probably arose in a later evolutionary development than these other features.
The feather structure indicates that they were not used for flight but for temperature regulation and display. The researchers' view is that, although the tail is that of a juvenile dinosaur, the specimen suggests that it is the feathers of an adult individual, not a juvenile.
The researchers noted that although this tail is that of a juvenile dinosaur, the specimen shows the feathers of an adult individual rather than the feathers of a bird.
A car bomb that exploded at the police headquarters in Gaziantep, Turkey, yesterday morning killed two police officers and injured more than twenty others.

The luminosity and rotation are used together to determine the star's Rosebie number, which refers to the flow of the plasma.
The lower the Rosby number, the less active the star is in the domain of its magnetic reversal.

The work done is largely theoretical in nature, but the program is written to simulate observations of the Sagittarius galaxy.
The effect the team was looking for would be produced by tidal forces between the galaxy's dark matter and the Milky Way's dark matter.
By the same principle that the Moon pulls the Earth, causing tides and ripples, the Milky Way exerts a force on the Sagittarius galaxy.
Scientists have concluded that dark matter affects other dark matter just as ordinary matter does.
According to this theory, most of the dark matter around the galaxy is arranged around the galaxy in the form of an halo, and is composed of many tiny particles.

Dr. Tony Moll discovered a form of tuberculosis that is extremely drug-resistant (XDR-TB) in the KwaZulu-Natal region of South Africa.
He said in an interview that the new strain was "extremely problematic and disturbing because of the high mortality rate".
Dr. Mol thinks that some patients may have been infected in the hospital, and at least two were hospital workers.

"Their thermal behavior is not as constant as in large caves on Earth, which often maintain a fairly constant temperature, but it is clear that this is so since these are deep holes in the ground", stated Glenn Cushing of the U.S. Geological and Astrogeological Survey team from Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff, Arizona.
In France, voting is traditionally very simple in terms of technology: the voters go alone to the booth and put the printed ballot paper with the name of the chosen candidate in the envelope.
Once the official has confirmed the identity of the voter, he puts the envelope in the ballot box and signs the voter list.
The legal elections of France very strictly codify the protocol.
Since 1988, ballot boxes must be transparent so that voters and observers can see that there are no envelopes at the start of the vote and no envelopes are added except those from registered and authorized voters.
Candidates may send representatives to attend each part of the process, and in the evenings, volunteers count the votes under strict supervision, following specific procedures.

Four skiers in the seventh category failed to finish their race, and 45 of the 117 skiers in the downhill failed to make the race rankings.
Madhya Pradesh police found a stolen laptop and mobile phone.
Deputy Inspector General D. K. Arya said: "We have arrested five persons who were raping the Swiss woman and have returned her mobile phone and laptop".
The accused are named as Baba Kanjar, Bhutta Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar and Vishnu Kanjar.
Police Superintendent Chanda Shekhar Solanki stated that they appeared in court with their faces covered.
Although three people were in the house when the car struck, none of them were injured.
The driver, however, suffered serious head injuries.
The road on which the collision occurred was temporarily closed while emergency services released the driver from the red Audi TT.
He was initially hospitalized at the James Padgett Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was subsequently transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
A woman has since been charged in the Edinburgh Sheriff Court with the murder of her son.
She is in custody awaiting indictment and trial, but any witness evidence could be compromised given that her picture has been published in many media outlets.
This is common practice elsewhere in the UK, but the Scottish legal system works differently and courts have found the publication of the photographs potentially harmful.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee observed: "Journalists seem to be walking a dangerous line if they publish pictures of suspects or something else".
The Scottish Public Prosecutor's Office, whose general jurisdiction is criminal prosecution, told reporters that there would be no further comment at least until the charges were brought.
According to leaked information, the document will deal with the border dispute, which Palestine wants to be based on the pre-Six-Day War 1967 borders.
Other topics discussed reportedly include the future status of Jerusalem, which is holy to both nations, and the question of the Jordan Valley.
Israel demands a continuous military presence in the valley for ten years after the signing of the agreement, while the Palestinian authorities agree that the presence exists for only five years.
The shooters in the Pest Control Supplement Action were to be under the strict supervision of the Ranger, as the action was monitored and its effectiveness evaluated.
Through a partnership between the NPWS and a corporation called the Sport Shooters' Association of Australia (NSW), qualified volunteers are employed under the Sport Shooters' Association's hunting program.
According to Mike Ohlin, acting director of park and heritage protection at the NPWS agency, the four shooters selected for the first shooting operation received comprehensive safety and training instructions.
The new nine-member Electoral Commission (CEP) was sworn in yesterday under Martelly.
It is Martelli's fifth electoral commission in four years.
Last month, the Presidential Commission recommended the previous resignation of the CEP as part of a package of measures to move the country towards new elections.
This commission was Martelly's response to widespread anti-regime protests that began in October.
Sometimes violent protests have been caused by non-observance of elections, some of which have been in place since 2011.
There have been some 60 reported cases of overheating of faulty iPods, resulting in a total of six fires and minor burns in four people.
The Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade, and Industry said that it was aware of 27 accidents involving such devices.
Last week, METI announced that it had been notified by Apple of 34 additional overheating incidents, which the company called "minor".
The ministry responded by calling Apple's delay in the report "very worthy of regret".
The earthquake struck Mariana at 07:19 am local time (9:19 pm GMT Friday).
The Office of Emergency Management in the Northern Mariana Islands said that no damage had been reported in the country.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also stated that there was no tsunami warning.
A former Filipino policeman held tourists hostage in Hong Kong by taking their bus to Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Ronaldo Mendoza fired his M16 rifle at tourists.
Several hostages have been rescued and at least six have been confirmed dead so far.
Six hostages, including children and the elderly, were released early, as were Filipino photographers.
Photographers later took the place of the elderly lady, as she needed a toilet.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and began to build a career in medicine.
He trained as an obstetrician and began working at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
While working at the hospital, Liggins began to investigate preterm births in his spare time.
His research showed that the use of the hormone would accelerate the fetal maturation of the baby's lungs.
Xinhua reported that government investigators on Wednesday found two "black boxes" containing flight records.
Fellow wrestlers also paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer stated: "Luna was the first queen of extreme. My first manager. Luna passed away in the night two months. Pretty unique likeness of her. A strong woman".
Dustin Goldstern Runnels commented: "Luna was as weird as I am...maybe more...I love her and I'll miss her...I hope she's in a better place".
Of the 1,400 people polled before the 2010 federal election, the number opposed to Australia becoming a republic rose by 8 percent from 2008.
Interim Prime Minister Julia Gillard argued during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed Australia should become a republic at the end of Elizabeth II's reign.
Thirty-four percent of those polled share this view and want Queen Elizabeth II to be the last Australian monarch.
In the extreme poll, 29 percent of respondents believe that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent believe that Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist was due to swim the 100 and 200 metres freestyle in three relay events at the Commonwealth Games, but his complaints have cast doubt on his fitness.
He could not take the pain medication he needed because it is banned at the Olympic Games.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number on January 25.
Several people confirmed the discovery using various hardware and software by early February, and it was announced on Tuesday.
Comets may have been a source of water that reached Earth along with organic matter that could form proteins and support life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form, especially how the Earth formed, since comets have collided with the Earth since ancient times.
Cuomo, 53, became governor earlier this year and signed a bill last month legalizing same-sex marriage.
He said of the rumors that they were "political babble and nonsense".
He is widely rumored to be running for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that the FAA claims will allow aircraft to fly shorter routes, and save a million gallons of fuel each year, as well as reduce carbon dioxide emissions.
It uses satellite technology, as opposed to earlier technologies based on ground-based radar, to allow air traffic controllers to determine the aircraft's position more accurately and to provide pilots with more accurate data.
No additional transportation placed on the overhead trains will stop at Wembley, and parking lots and facilities such as the car park and driveway are not available above ground.
Fears of a lack of transportation raised the possibility that the match would have to be played behind closed doors without a team's fans.
Research published Thursday in the journal Science reports the creation of a new species of birds on the Ecuadorian Galapagos Islands.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that the new species evolved over the course of just two generations, although this process is believed to take much longer, due to mating between the endemic Darwin's hare, Geospiza fortes, and the introduced cactus hare, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be worked into all kinds of shapes. It can be rolled into tiny shapes.
It can be machined into thin wire, which can be twisted or braided, or it can be hammered or rolled into sheets.
It can be made in a very thin form, as well as glued to some other metal. It can be so thin that it has sometimes been used to decorate pictures in books known as "illuminated manuscripts".
This is called the pH value of the chemical.
The color of cabbage juice varies according to whether the chemical is acidic or alkaline.
The pH level indicates the amount of hydrogen ions (H in pH) in the test chemical.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have had their electrons stripped (since a hydrogen atom is made up of one proton and one electron).
Mix the two dry powders together, and then squeeze them into a ball with your clean, moist hands.
The moisture on your hands will react with the outer layers, causing a strange sensation and forming a kind of wrap.
The towns of Harapa and Mohenjo-daro had toilet bowl in almost every house, connected to a sophisticated sewer system.
Remains of a sewer system have been found in houses of the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini in Greece.
Toilets also existed in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. In Roman civilization, toilets were once part of public baths, where men and women were in the same company together.
When you call someone thousands of miles away, you use a satellite.
A satellite in space receives the call and then returns it down almost instantly.
Scientists use space telescopes because the earth's atmosphere reflects some of the light and images.
Launching a satellite or telescope into space requires a huge rocket, over 100 feet high.
The biggest thing that the wheel has done for us is it has made it possible for us to move much easier and much faster.
This brought us a train, a car, and many other means of transportation.
Below them are medium-sized cats that eat medium-sized prey, from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
Finally, there are many small cats (including free-living pet cats) that eat far more small prey such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret of their success is the concept of an ecological niche, a special job that each cat does that prevents it from competing with others.
Lions are the most sociable of all cats, and they live in large groups known as pack animals.
Choporis consist of one to three adult males in a litter, with up to thirty females and juveniles.
Females are usually closely related to one another, forming a large family of sisters and daughters.
Wolfhounds behave similarly to wolves or dogs, animals that are surprisingly similar in behavior to lions (but not other big cats), and are also very deadly to their prey.
As an all-round athlete, the tiger can climb trees (though not well), swim, leap great distances, and pull with five times the strength of a strong man.
The tiger is in the same group (genus Panthera) as lions, leopards, and jaguars, and these four are the only cats that can howl.
The tiger's voice is not like the lion's loud voice but more like a sentence full of sharp, high-pitched words.
The ocelot prefers to eat small animals, including monkeys, snakes, rodents, and if possible birds, since all the animals it hunts are much smaller than it is.
Scientists believe that the ocelots track and seek prey by smell, sniffing the ground they have been on.
They can see very well in the dark with the help of night vision, and they move very imperceptibly.
When a small group of living things (a small population) separates from the main population from which they originated (for example, if they move across a mountain range or river or if they move to a new island so they cannot easily return back) they will often find themselves in an environment different from the one they were in before.
This new environment has different resources and different rivals, so the new population will have to have different characteristics or adapt to be a stronger rival than was previously required.
The original population has not changed at all, and they still need the same adaptations as before.
Over time, as a new population begins to adapt to its new environment, it becomes less and less like the other population.
Eventually, after many thousands or even millions of years, two populations will look so different that they can no longer be called the same species.
We call this process speciation, which simply means the creation of new species.
Plants produce the oxygen that humans breathe in, and they take in the carbon dioxide that humans exhale (that is, exhale).
Plants make their food from the sun by means of photosynthesis, and they also provide us with cool air.
We make houses from plants, we make clothes from plants, most of the food we eat is from plants, and without plants, animals would not be able to survive.
The Mossaurus was the supreme predator of its day, and they feared nothing but other Mossaurus.
Its long jaws were pierced with more than 70 teeth, sharp as razor blades, along with an additional set of teeth on a hard blade, meaning that nothing in its path could escape.
We cannot say for certain, but it may have had a scaly tongue, a diet of turtles, crustaceans, and other mosasaurs, and may have even been a cannibal.
It also attacked anything that entered the water; even a giant dinosaur like T. rex would not have been able to do it.
Although most of their food would be familiar to us, the Romans had some strange or unusual things of their own to feast on, including wild boars, peacocks, swallows, and a type of rodent called a plume.
Another difference was that while the poor men and women ate their food sitting in chairs, the rich liked to hold banquets at which they would lie on their sides while eating their meals.
Ancient Roman meals could not contain the ingredients that came to Europe from the Americas or Asia in later centuries.
For example, they had no corn, no tomatoes, no potatoes, no cocoa, and no ancient Roman had ever tasted churethra.
The Babylonians built a temple to each of their gods, which was considered the primary house of that god.
People would offer sacrifices to the gods, and priests would try to appease the deities through ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open courtyard in front of the temple and an inner sanctuary into which only the priests could enter.
At one time, special pyramid-shaped towers, called ziggurats, were built to be part of temples.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary for the god.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, home was not so important.
Most of the Hebrew family's daily activities were outdoors.
Women cooked in the courtyard; shops were only open stalls facing the street; stone was used to build the house.
There were no large forests in the land of Canaan, so the wood was extremely expensive.
Greenland was sparsely inhabited. In the Norse sagas, it is said that Erik the Red was banished from Iceland for murder, and when he traveled further west, he found Greenland and called it Greenland.
But whatever his discovery, the Eskimo tribes were already living there at the time.
Although each country was "Scandinavian", there were numerous differences among the peoples, kings, customs, and histories of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you have seen the film National Treasure, you may think that the treasure map is drawn against the backdrop of the Declaration of Independence.
Although the document has a design on the back, it is not a treasure map.
On the back of the Declaration of Independence were the words "Original Declaration of Independence of July 4, 1776". The text appears on the bottom of the document, in reverse.
Although no one knows for sure who wrote it, it is known that somewhere in its early days this large parchment document (293⁄4 inches by 241⁄2 inches in size) was a storage box.
Well, most likely the tag was added as a mere tag.
The D-Day landings and the battles that followed liberated the north of France, but the south was not yet free.
It was led by the Visigoths, who had made peace with the Germans in 1940 and had allied themselves with them instead of fighting them.
On 15 August 1940, the Allies attacked southern France, an invasion dubbed Operation Dragoon.
In just two weeks, the Americans and Free French forces liberated the south of France and moved toward Germany.
A civilization is a unique culture shared by a significantly large group of people who live and work together in a cooperative, or society.
The word civilization is derived from the Latin word civilis, meaning civil, and is related to the Latin civis, meaning citizen, and civitas, meaning city or city-state, which also defines the size of a community.
Civilized culture involves the transmission of knowledge over several generations, lasting cultural imprints, and equitable expansion.
Smaller cultures usually disappear without leaving any relevant historical evidence, and are often not recognized as true civilizations.
As the war for independence raged, the thirteen states first formed a weak central government - with Congress as the sole component - under the Treaty of Confederation.
Congress had no authority to impose taxes, and since there was no national executive or judicial authority, it relied on state authorities, which were often ineffective in enforcing all their legal documents.
He also had no right to overrule tax laws and interstate tariffs.
Unanimous approval by all states was required before membership could be changed, and states were so loosely bound to central government that their representatives were often absent from meetings.
The Italian national football team, along with the German national football team, is the second most successful team in the world and were the winners of the 2006 World Cup.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and Formula One racing.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern regions, and Italians compete in international games or Olympic events.
Japan is made up of nearly 7,000 islands (the largest of which is Honshu), making it the 7th largest island in the world!
Because of the group of islands it has, Japan is often called an  archipelago on geographical displays.
Taiwan's origins go back to the 15th century, when European sailors passing by it noted the island's name as Ilja formosa, or beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan, initiating a transformation of the aboriginal practice of wheat production, and sent Chinese workers to work on its rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, Qing dynasty (1644-1912) forces took control of the western and northern coastal parts of Taiwan, and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
After defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Shimonoseki Treaty in 1895, which gave Japan sovereignty over Taiwan, which it ruled until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main buildings, the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room with Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the outskirts of the complex have been reconstructed to give tourists a better idea of what they originally looked like.
By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and the restoration continues to this day.
For example, the most common still image format for photography in the world is 35 mm, which was the dominant size of film at the end of the analog film era.
It is still produced today, but more importantly, its width-to-height ratio has inherited the image sensor formats of digital cameras.
The 35 mm format is actually, somewhat confusingly, 36 mm wide and 24 mm high.
The ratio of the dimensions of this format is considered to be 3:2 (divided by 12 to get the simplest ratio in the form of a whole number).
Many common formats (say the APS family of formats) are equal to or nearly this size.
The often abused and often mocked rule of thirds is simply a guideline that creates dynamism while maintaining the measure of order in the picture.
It states that the most striking place for the main subject is at the intersection of the lines that vertically and horizontally divide the image into thirds (see example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become rich and powerful, began to be censored.
For thousands of years, the Christian religion bound the European nations together, despite differences in language and customs.
With its inexhaustible power, it affected everyone, from kings to commoners.
One of the main Christian principles is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty and that the monetary funds of the churches are there for that very reason.
The central authority of the church was in Rome for more than a thousand years, and this concentration of power and money has led many to question whether this principle has been fulfilled.
Immediately after the outbreak of hostilities, Britain began a naval blockade of Germany.
The strategy proved effective, cutting off the flow of key military and civilian supplies, although the blockade violated generally accepted international law codified in several international treaties over the past two centuries.
Britain mined international waters to prevent any ships from entering entire stretches of ocean, thus endangering even neutral ships.
Since the responses to this tactic were limited, Germany expected a similar response to its policy of unrestricted submarine warfare.
During the 1920's, the prevailing attitudes of most citizens and nations were pacifism and isolationism.
After seeing the horrors and atrocities of World War I, the nations wanted to avoid such a situation in the future.
In order to accept a job with the New York Edison Company, Tesla moved to the United States in 1884.
He arrived in the United States with 4 cents in his pocket, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Bachelor (his boss at his previous job) intended for Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of depicting different time periods; each period of China or each ruling family represented a distinct dynasty.
There was also an unstable era of divided provinces between each dynasty. The most famous period of all was the Three Kingdoms period which lasted sixty years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During this period, there was intense warfare between many nobles who fought for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest periods in ancient Chinese history, with thousands of people dying in a battle for the throne in the huge palace at Si'an.
There are many social and political outcomes such as the use of the metric system, the shift from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism, and the belief that the state belongs to the people, not to one ruler.
Also after the revolution, occupations were opened to all men who applied, allowing the most ambitious and successful to succeed.
The same applies to the military, for instead of being based on class, military acts are now based on caliber.
The French Revolution also inspired many oppressed working-class people in other countries to launch their own revolutions.
Muhammad was deeply interested in matters that were outside of his ordinary life, and he often went to meditate in a cave that became known as Hira on Mount Nur (light).
The cave itself, which has survived through the ages, gives a very clear picture of Muhammad's spiritual inclinations.
Located on top of one of the mountains north of Mecca, the cave is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, it is difficult to find, even if one knows it exists.
Nothing can be seen except the clear, beautiful sky and the many surrounding mountains.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders of the World that still exists.
The Great Pyramid, built by the Egyptians in the third century B.C.E., is one of a number of large pyramidal structures that pay homage to the deceased pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau, or Giza Necropolis in Egypt's Valley of the Dead, consists of several pyramids (the Great Pyramid being the largest), several small tombs, several temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built in honor of the Pharaoh Khufu, and many smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built in honor of Khufu's wives and family members.
The uz arc sign looks like a V, and the niz arc sign looks like a splice or square missing the bottom edge.
upper means you should start from the top and push the chuck, while down means you should start from the frog (where your hand holds the chuck) and pull the chuck.
Raising the bellows usually produces a low-pitched sound, while lowering the bellows produces a louder and more assertive sound.
Feel free to write your markings in pencil, but remember that printed chevron marks are there for a musical reason, and they should usually be respected.
Frightened King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette and their two young children (Marie-Thérèse, 11, and Louis-Charles, four), as well as the king's sister, Madame Elisabeth, were forced on 6 October 1789 to retreat to Paris from Versailles, by a mob of women from the piazza.
They traveled back to Paris in a carriage, surrounded by a crowd of people who were screaming and shouting threats against the king and queen.
The mob ordered the king and queen to open wide the windows of the coach.
At one point, a member of the staff waved the head of a royal guard killed at Versailles to the terrified queen.
The war costs of American imperialism in the conquest of the Philippines were paid by the Filipino citizens themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the colonial regime in the United States to cover most of the cost and interest on the securities that circulated on behalf of the Philippine government through Wall Street banks.
Of course, the enormous profits derived from the long-term exploitation of the Filipino people were the main gain of American imperialism.
To understand the Templars, one must also understand the context that prompted the creation of the order.
The period in which these events took place is often called the Late Middle Ages, a period of European history in the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000-1300 CE).
The high Middle Ages were preceded by the High Middle Ages, and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which formally ended around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a wide range of ideas in practice, from technological pressure or technological imperative to the strict sense that human destiny is guided by a fundamental logic related to scientific laws and their manifestations in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism have two general ideas: that technological development itself proceeds by a path that is beyond cultural and political influences and that in turn technology has its "effects" on societies that are inherent, rather than socially conditioned.
For example, a motor vehicle might be said to necessarily lead to road development.
Still, a national road network is not economically viable for just a few cars, so new production methods have been developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
Mass car ownership also leads to higher rates of road accidents, which leads to the invention of new techniques in healthcare to repair damaged bodies.
Romanticism contained a considerable dose of cultural determinism, drawn from writers such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography shaped individuals and over time customs and cultures would emerge tied to that geography, and these, in keeping with the place of the society, were superior to arbitrarily imposed laws.
Just as Paris is known as the fashion capital of the modern world, so Constantinople is considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its reputation as the epicenter of luxury began around 400 and lasted until about 1100.
Its status declined during the twelfth century, largely due to the fact that the crusaders returned, bringing gifts, such as silk and spices, that were more valuable than those offered by the Byzantine market.
It was at this time that the title of fashion capital was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style reached its zenith between the 10th and 11th centuries and the 14th century.
At first, the dress was strongly influenced by Byzantine culture in the east.
However, due to slow communication channels, the styles in the West could be in a backward position for some 25 to 30 years.
By the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe had begun to develop its own style. One of the greatest inventions of the era as a result of the Crusades was the use of buttons to fasten clothing.
Consumer agriculture is agriculture that is conducted to produce enough food for only the needs of the farmer and his/her family.
Consumer agriculture is a simple, often organic system, which uses preserved seed, native to a given ecoregion in combination with crop rotation and other relatively simple techniques to increase yields.
Historically, most farmers were self-employed, and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together like-minded people who feel left out by societal norms and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures may be distinguished by the age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender of the members.
The characteristics that define a subculture as unique may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or a combination of factors.
Members of subcultures often designate their membership through distinctive and symbolic uses of style, which includes fashion, mannerism, and jargon.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to look at some sad cases of children who, due to neglect, accident or physical abuse, were not socialized by adults while growing up.
Some feral children have been confined by humans (usually their own parents); in some cases, this abandonment of children occurs as a result of the parents' refusal to accept the child's serious intellectual and physical disabilities.
Foster children may have experienced severe childhood abuse or trauma before being abandoned or running away.
Others are said to have been raised by animals; others are said to have lived in the wild by themselves.
When fully raised by nonhuman animals, feral children display behavior (within physical boundaries) that almost entirely resembles the behavior of those animals that have cared for them, such as their fear or indifference to humans.
While project-based learning should make learning easier and more interesting, learning through the skelas system goes a step further.
Metacognitive support is not a learning method, but rather a support provided to individuals, with the help of which they go through a new learning experience, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Support can be virtual and real, in other words, the teacher is actually a kind of support person, but so is the little human-spawner in Microsoft Office.
Virtual assistants are an integral part of the software and are supposed to examine, encourage and explain procedures that might be too complicated for students to implement themselves.
Children are placed in foster care for a variety of reasons, ranging from neglect to abuse and even exploitation.
No child should ever grow up in an environment that is not nurturing, caring, and educational, but it does.
We view the foster-family system as a safe haven for these children.
Our foster-family system should provide a secure home, caring caregivers, continuing education, and reliable health care.
Family housing of children should provide all the necessities that were lacking in the homes from which they were previously taken.
The Internet combines elements of both mass and interpersonal communication.
The unique characteristics of the Internet have led to additional dimensions in terms of usage and access to content.
For example, "learning" and "socialization" are cited as important purposes of using the Internet (James et al., 1995).
Eimey and McCord (1998) identified "personal engagement" and "maintained relationships" as new motivational aspects when investigating audience reactions to websites.
The use of video recording has led to significant discoveries in the interpretation of microexpressions, facial movements lasting a few milliseconds.
In particular, it is claimed that if you correctly interpret the microexpressions, you can tell if a person is lying.
Oliver Sacks in his work The Speaker's Speech pointed out how people who are unable to understand speech because of brain damage can still accurately assess sincerity.
He even thinks that animals such as domestic dogs may have such abilities in understanding human behavior.
Research in the 20th century has revealed two forms of genetic variation: hidden and revealed.
Mutation adds new genetic variation, and selection removes it from the pool of expressed variation.
Segregation and recombination affect the constant mixing of variation between the two funds in each generation.
In the savannah, a primate with a human-like digestive tract has difficulty meeting its need for amino acids from the plant sources at its disposal.
Even failure to do so can have serious consequences: increased depression, malnutrition, and eventually death.
The vegetable resources most readily available were proteins available in leaves and shells, but primates like us find it difficult to cheat them if they are not cooked.
By contrast, animal foods (meats, termites, eggs) are not only easily digested but also provide a large amount of protein containing all the essential amino acids.
All things considered, it should not surprise us if our ancestors solved their "protein problem" in much the same way that chimpanzees do today in the savanna.
Sleep deprivation is the process of deliberately waking up during your normal sleep period and falling asleep shortly thereafter (10-60 minutes).
This can easily be accomplished with a relatively quiet alarm clock that would bring you to consciousness without fully awakening you.
If you reset the clock during sleep, you can put it on the other side of the room, which will force you to get out of bed and turn it off.
Other biorhythm-based options include drinking plenty of fluids (especially water or tea, a well-known diuretic) before bedtime, which causes a person to get up to urinate.
The amount of inner peace that a person possesses is inversely proportional to the amount of tension in that person's body and spirit.
The lower the tension, the more positive the life force.
The only thing standing in the way of this goal is our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but these have been expanded by the Mahayana love path and many Indian yoga techniques.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple, consisting of a kundalini of yoga, meditation, and the path of all-embracing love.
With Kundalini yoga, the Kundalini energy (energy of enlightenment) is awakened through yoga poses, breathing exercises, mantras and visualizations.
The center of Tibetan meditation is the deity of Yoga. By visualizing the various deities, energy channels are cleansed, chakras are activated, and enlightened consciousness is created.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, which led to cooperation between the USSR and the U.S. At the end of the war, the conflict of systems, processes and cultures led to the two countries becoming confused.
Two years after the war ended, former allies were now enemies, and the Cold War began.
Planned to last 40 years, the struggle would be a straightforward one, through the conflicts of smaller countries representing the interests of larger military powers, on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, in Cuba, and in many other places.
By 17 September 1939, the Polish defences had already been broken, and the only hope was a withdrawal and reorganization along the Romanian bridgehead.
However, these plans became obsolete almost overnight, when over 800,000 soldiers from the Soviet Union's Red Army entered and created the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts after occupying the eastern areas of Poland in violation of the Peace Treaty of Riga, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other international agreements, both bilateral and multilateral.
Trans-oceanic shipping is arguably the most efficient way to move large numbers of people and large amounts of goods across the ocean.
The Navy's job has traditionally been to ensure that your country retains the ability to transport people and goods, while also preventing the enemy from transporting its people and goods.
One of the most infamous recent examples of this was the North Atlantic campaign of World War II, in which the Americans attempted to transport men and arms across the Atlantic to aid the British.
At the same time, the German Navy, using submarines mostly, was trying to stop this traffic.
Had the Allies failed, Germany would likely have been as capable of conquering Britain as it was of conquering the rest of Europe.
Goats appear to have been first domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to keep them for easier access to milk, hair, meat, and hides.
Domesticated goats were generally kept in herds that roamed the hills or other pasturage, often accompanied by herders who were mostly children or young, similar to the more familiar shepherds.
Wagonways were built in England as early as the 16th century.
Although early railways consisted only of parallel wooden planks, they allowed horse-drawn carriages to achieve higher speeds and to pull greater loads than on the slightly uneven roads of the time.
Railroad sleepers were introduced fairly early to keep the tracks in place, but it was gradually realized that the tracks would be more efficient if they had an iron bar on top.
This became a standard practice, but the iron caused more damage to the wooden wheel.
In time, wooden wheels were replaced by iron ones. In 1767, full-iron tires were used for the first time.
The first known form of transport was walking. Humans began walking upright about 2 million years ago with the appearance of Homo erectus (meaning upright man).
Their predecessors, the Australopithecus, did not walk upright as is customary.
Perfection in bipedalism has been found in the fossil mastralopithecus from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, although sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can start living more environmentally friendly lives, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even become activists to reduce some of the suffering in the future.
In many cases this is symptomatic, but if we want more than a temporary solution, we should find the root of the problem and extinguish it.
Clearly, the world has changed a great deal as a result of mankind's scientific and technological advances, and problems have been made worse by human overpopulation and extravagant lifestyles.
After being adopted by Congress on July 4, a handwritten draft signed by Congressman John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thompson was sent a few blocks away, to John Dunlap's printing press.
During the night, between 150 and 200 copies were made, now known as "Danlap's pages".
John Nixon first publicly read this document on July 8 in the courtyard of Independence Hall.
A copy was sent to George Washington on July 6, read to his troops on July 9 in New York, and a copy reached London on August 10.
The 25 Danlap Letters that are still known to exist are the oldest extant copies of the document.
Many paleontologists today believe that one group of dinosaurs survived and is alive today.
Many people do not consider them dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
But there are many things about birds that still look like dinosaurs.
They have feet with hooves and claws, lay eggs, and walk on two hind legs like T. rex.
Virtually all computers in use today are based on manipulating information that is encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can have only one of two values, 0 or 1, and these numbers are called binary digits - or bits in computer jargon.
Symptoms such as vomiting are common enough that a diagnosis cannot be made immediately.
The best indicator of internal poisoning may be the presence of an open package of medications or toxic household chemicals.
Look at the label for specific first-aid instructions for that particular poison.
Entomologists use the term "bug" in a formal sense for this group of insects.
The term comes from ancient familiarity with cockroaches, insects very well adapted to parasitize humans.
Both killer and common cockroaches are long-living species, adapted to life in a bed or a host home.
There are an estimated 400,000 cases of multiple sclerosis (MS) in the United States, making it the leading neurological disease in young and middle-aged persons.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which includes the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
The study found that women are twice as likely to have MS symptoms as men.
A couple may decide that raising a baby is not in their best interests or in the best interests of their child.
These couples may decide to plan on adopting a child.
In adoption, the biological parents give up their parental rights so that the other couple can be the child's parents.
The main task of science is to understand the way the world works by using the scientific method. This method actually drives most of scientific research.
However, experimentation is not the only thing, and an experiment is a test used to eliminate one or more possible hypotheses.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts, especially the Bible in Latin.
Aristotle's views on all scientific matters, including psychology, were respected.
As knowledge of Greek declined, the West found itself cut off from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many observed rhythms in physiology and behavior often depend crucially on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production by biological clocks.
Periodic biological rhythms that do not merely respond to the periodic shifting of external influences have been recorded in most living organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that will continue to have a period of free running, even if there are no external signs.
The Hershey-Chase experiment was one of the leading indicators that DNA is genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages, or viruses, to insert their own DNA into bacteria.
They did two experiments that labeled DNA phage with radioactive phosphorus or protein phage with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have different effects depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the part of the genetic material affected, and whether the cells affected are reproductive cells.
Only mutations in the basal cells can be passed on to children, while mutations elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism attracts people who are interested in visiting natural areas, and in enjoying the landscape, including the flora and fauna of the wild.
Field activities include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, visiting parks, and studying ecosystem data.
For example, visiting, photographing, and learning about orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning people leave small rural places by car to go to their workplaces, mingling with those whose workplace is located in the very place they just left.
In this dynamic transport process, all are somehow connected and support a transport system based on private cars.
Science now indicates that this high-carbon economy has stripped the biosphere of one of its stable states that have supported human evolution over the past two million years.
Almost everyone complains about the transportation system.
In developed lands, similar complaints about water quality or collapsing bridges are rare.
Why do transportation systems cause such complaints and make daily mistakes? Are transportation engineers simply incompetent? Or is something more serious going on?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points, as well as their interactions with each other.
Unfortunately, studying traffic flows is difficult because the behavior of drivers cannot be predicted with 100% certainty.
Fortunately, drivers generally behave within a reasonable range of consistency; thus traffic currents have some reasonable consistency and can be represented roughly mathematically.
To give a better idea of traffic flow, three main characteristics are linked: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These relationships help in the planning, design, and operation of the facilities on the road.
Insects were the first animals to take to the air, and their ability to fly helped them to avoid enemies and more efficiently find food and mates.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fuse their wings with their bodies.
This gives them a greater choice of various small places to hide from predators.
The only insects today that cannot fold their wings are the fairy's rams and water flowers.
Thousands of years earlier, a man named Aristarchus had said that the solar system revolves around the sun.
Some people believed that he was right, but many believed the opposite; that the solar system revolved around the earth, including the sun (and even other stars).
This sounds reasonable, since it does not feel as if the earth is moving, does it?
The Amazon River is the second longest and the first largest river on Earth, carrying 8 times as much water as the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, with its mestimic width of six miles.
Some 20 percent of the water that flows from the world's rivers into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The main Amazon River is 6387 km (3,980 miles) long, and it collects water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although the construction of stone pyramids continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, nothing surpassed the pyramids at Giza in their size and technical construction excellence.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom marveled at the monuments of their predecessors, which by then were over a thousand years old.
With a population of about 800, the Vatican is the world's smallest independent state and the least populous country.
The Vatican uses Italian in its laws and official communication.
Italian is also the everyday language used by most of those working in the State, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of the Vatican are Roman Catholics.
The basic chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper have been known to man since ancient times, since they can be found in nature in their original form and can be extracted relatively easily by primitive tools.
The philosopher Aristotle theorized that everything was made up of a mixture of only one or a few of the four elements - earth, water, air, and fire.
This was more like four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gaseous, plasma, although he also theorized that these transform into new substances to form what we see.
Alloy is actually a mixture of two or more metals.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered metals.
There are also alloys that consist of small amounts of non-metals such as carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter, all matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly small that billions of them could fit into the period at the end of this sentence.
So the pencil was a good friend to many people when it appeared.
Sadly, when new writing methods emerged, the pencil was relegated to a lower status and used less.
People now type messages on a computer screen without ever having been near a typewriter.
We can only wonder what the keyboard will become when it encounters something new.
The physics bomb works by taking energy to form a nucleus of many protons and neutrons.
It is like pushing a heavy cart down a hill, and the energy released by the re-pushing of the core is then measured.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, meaning they tend to decay with little or no stimulation.
The surface of the moon is made up of rock and dust.
The crust is approximately 70 km thick on the near side and 100 km thick on the far side.
It is thin under the lunar sea, and thick under the hills.
The shallow crust may have caused the moon to have more moons nearby, making it easier for lava to rise to the surface.
Content theories are geared to finding out what moves people or what they like.
These theories suggest that humans have certain needs and/or desires that they have internalized as they mature into adults.
These theories study what it is in certain people that makes them want the things they do, and what things in their environment will make them do or not do certain things.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs theory and Herzberg's two factor theory.
Generally speaking, two types of behavior can occur when managers start to lead their former colleagues: At one end of the spectrum is an attempt to remain "eaten by the boys" (or girls).
This type of manager has difficulty making unpopular decisions, implementing disciplinary measures, assessing performance, assigning responsibilities and holding people accountable.
At the other end of the spectrum, the person becomes an unrecognizable individual who feels that he must change everything the team has been working on and make it his own.
Ultimately, the leader is responsible for the success and failure of the team.
This behavior often results in a gap between the leader and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams should meet the same quality standards as conventional teams, but there are subtle differences.
Virtual team members often function as a contact for their immediate physical group.
They often have more autonomy than conventional team members, as their teams may be composed according to different time zones that local management would not have an understanding of.
The presence of a real "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p. 109) is also a unique element of a virtual team.
The Invisible Team is the management team to which each member reports.
Would an organization want to go through the long process of establishing a learning organization?
When all available resources are used efficiently in the functional departments of the organization, creativity and resourcefulness can come to the fore.
As a result, an organizational process in which people work together to overcome a barrier can result in a new innovative process that will meet customer needs.
Before an organization can be innovative, leadership must create a culture of innovation as well as shared knowledge and organizational learning.
Engel (2006) explains the continuum approach as a method used to help organizations achieve higher levels of productivity.
Neurobiological data provide physical evidence for a theoretical approach to cognitive research, which narrows the field of research and makes it much more accurate.
The link between brain pathology and behavior supports the claims of scientists in their studies.
For a long time it has been known that various types of brain damage, trauma, lesions, and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in some mental functions.
The development of new technologies allows us to see and investigate brain structures and processes that we have never seen before.
This provides us with a lot of data and material to create simulation models that help us understand the processes in our minds.
Although it has strong connotations of science fiction, AI is a very important branch of computer science that deals with the behavior, learning, and intelligent adaptation of machines.
Research in the field of artificial intelligence involves building machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include control, planning and scheduling, the ability to respond to client diagnoses and questions, as well as handwriting, voice, and facial recognition.
Such things have become separate disciplines that focus on providing solutions to real-life problems.
Artificial intelligence (AI) systems are now widely used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering, and military purposes, with it being built into several home computers and video game software applications.
Excursions are a big part of every classroom, and often teachers would like to take their students to places where bus travel is not an option.
Technology offers solutions in the form of virtual excursions, where students can view museum exhibits, visit an aquarium, or admire fine art while sitting in their class.
Virtual sharing of trip experiences is also a great way to reflect on the trip and share experiences with future classes.
For example, each year the Bennett High School students from North Carolina design a web page about their trip to the state capital, each year the web page is redesigned, but older versions are kept online so that they can serve as an album.
Blogs can also help improve writing in students. Although students often begin their blogging experience with sloppy grammar and spelling, the presence of an audience generally changes this.
Since students are often the most critical audience, the blogger begins to try to correct the writing to avoid criticism.
Blogging also "encourages students to become more engaged with the world around them". The need to stimulate public interest inspires students to be smart and curious (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that inspires collaboration and encourages students to extend learning beyond the traditional school day.
Appropriate use of blogs can empower students to become more analytical and critical; through actively responding to materials from the internet, students can define their own views in the context of other texts, as well as express their own perspectives on certain issues (Oravets, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada's charming, bilingual capital, and it has a number of art galleries and museums that showcase Canada's past and present.
Further south are Niagara Falls, while the north is a haven of untouched natural beauty for Muscoque and beyond.
All of this further highlights Ontario as something that foreigners basically consider to be Canadian.
Large areas further north are fairly sparsely populated, and some are almost completely uninhabited wilderness.
For a population comparison that surprises many: there are more African Americans living in the United States than Canadian citizens.
The East African islands are located in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest island, and a continent in its own right when it comes to wildlife.
Most of the smaller islands are independent nations, or associated with France, and are known as luxury beach resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam to the mainland, and it was largely accepted on the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century, when Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the Cape Route from Europe to India.
The region is bounded on the north by the Sahel, and on the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
Wives: It is recommended that all travelers state that they are married, regardless of actual marital status.
It is also helpful to wear a ring (but not one that looks too expensive).
Women should understand that cultural differences can lead to something they would consider disturbing, and it is not uncommon for them to follow, hold hands, and so forth.
Be firm in your rejection of men and do not be afraid to take a stand (cultural differences or not, that does not make it okay!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century B.C.E., and was used by the Phoenicians, Romans, and Merindians as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it as Casa Branca, only to abandon it after the 1755 earthquake.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city under the name of Dar-ul-Badiah, and the Spanish merchants who established trading bases there gave it the name of Casablanca.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting cities to shop in all of Morocco.
In the vicinity of the old Medina it is easy to find places selling traditional Moroccan goods, such as taginis, pottery, leather galantry, hookahs and a whole spectrum of dranguli, but all of this is aimed at tourists.
Goma is a tourist town in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in the far east near Rwanda.
Goma was devastated in 2002 by the Nyiragongo volcanic eruption, which covered most of the city streets, especially in the city center.
Although Goma is fairly safe, any visits outside Goma should be carefully examined to understand the state of the fighting that continues in North Kivu province.
This city is also the base from which the ascent of the N'hirango volcano begins, along with some of the cheapest tracking of mountain gorillas in Africa.
You can use a boda-boda (a motorcycle-type taxi) to get around Goma. The usual (local) price is ~500 Congolese Francs for a short ride.
Due to its relative inaccessibility, Timbuktu is used as a metaphor for exotic, remote lands.
Today, Timbuctoo is a poverty-stricken city, though its reputation is that of a tourist attraction, and it has an airport.
Threatened by desert sand, Timbuktu was added to the list of World Heritage in Danger in 1990.
It was one of Henry Louis Gates' main stations during the filming of "Wonders of the African World", on PBS.
This city is in sharp contrast to other cities in the country, as it has more Arab than African flavor.
Kruger National Park (NPK) is located northeast of South Africa and along the border with Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, while the southern border is the Crocodile River.
The park covers 6,500 square miles [19,500 sq km] and is divided into 14 different ecological zones, each of which contains a variety of wildlife.
It is one of South Africa's main attractions and is considered the main attraction of South Africa's National Parks (NASP).
As with all South African national parks, there are daily fees for conservation and entry to the park.
Consider buying a wild card, which allows entry into certain South African parks or all the national parks of the Republic of South Africa.
Hong Kong Island gives the territory of Hong Kong its name and is a place that many tourists consider to be the main focus.
The skyline of Hong Kong is likened to a bright, streaky graph that becomes visible with the presence of Victoria Harbour's waters.
To get the best view of Hong Kong, leave the island and head for the Kowloon waterfront on the opposite side.
Most of the urban area of Hong Kong Island is densely packed on reclaimed land along the north shore.
This place was taken over by British colonists, so if you are looking for evidence of the territory's colonial past, there is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans is the largest inshore mangrove belt in the world, and extends 80 km (50 mi) from the coast to the rear of Bangladesh and India.
The Sundarbans is a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and part of the forest within Indian territory is called the Sundarbans National Park.
However, forests are not just mangrove swamps - they include some of the last remaining powerful jungles that once covered the Gangetic plain.
The Sundarbans extends over an area of 3850 km2, of which one-third is covered by wetlands.
Since 1966, the Sundarbans has been a wildlife reserve, and it is estimated that there are now 400 royal Bengal tigers and about 30,000 peacocks in the area.
Buses depart from inter-city bus stations (across the river) throughout the day, though most, especially those heading east and Jakarta/Bumnang, depart between 06:30 and 07:30.
Since interurban buses are often crowded, it is advisable to buy a ticket a few days in advance.
Most districts are served by Japanese minibuses, which are comfortable and durable.
Sharing taxis is a quick and convenient way to get to nearby places, such as Paro (No. 150) and Punaka (No. 200).
The Oiapoque River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge that spans the Oiapoque River to connect the cities of Oiapoque, Brazil, and Saint-Georges del Oiapoque, French Guiana.
The two towers reach a height of 83 meters, and the bridge is 378 meters long and has two 3.5-meter-wide lanes.
The vertical opening under the bridge is 15 metres (49 ft) in size. Construction was completed in August 2011, but it was not opened to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is planned to be fully operational in September 2017, when the completion of customs posts on the Brazilian side is expected.
The Guarani were the most important indigenous group inhabiting what is now eastern Paraguay, and they lived as semi-nomadic hunters who also engaged in self-sustaining agriculture.
The Chaco region was home to other indigenous tribal groups such as the Gwaycuro and Payagüas, who survived by hunting, gathering and fishing.
Paraguay, formerly called the Divo Province of India, was founded in the 16th century as a result of encounters between Spanish conquistadors and indigenous indigenous groups.
The Spanish began a period of colonization that lasted three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to retain much of its indigenous character and identity.
Argentina is known for having one of the best polo teams and players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year is held in December at the polo grounds in Las Cañitas.
Smaller tournaments and matches can also be seen here at other times of the year.
For all tournament news and information on where to buy tickets for polo matches, check out the Argentine Polo Association (Asociacion Argentina de Polo).
The official Falklands currency is the Falklands pound (FRF) whose value is set equivalent to one British pound (GBP).
Money can be exchanged at the only bank on the islands, located in Stanley across from the FIC West store.
British pounds will generally be accepted anywhere on the islands and within Stanley credit cards, and US dollars are also often accepted.
In remote islands credit cards are unlikely to be accepted, although British and United States currency may be accepted; check with the owners in advance to determine which payment method is acceptable.
It is almost impossible to exchange the Falkland currency outside the island, so change the money before leaving the island.
Since Montevidéu is south of the equator, it is summer there when winter is in the northern hemisphere, and vice versa.
Montevideo has a subtropical climate; in the summer months, temperatures over 30°C are common.
Winter can be deceptively cool: temperatures rarely go below zero, but wind and humidity combined make it feel much cooler than the thermometer says.
There are no distinct wet and dry seasons: the amount of rainfall is roughly the same throughout the year.
Although many animals in the park are used to seeing people, the wild world is still wild, and they should not be fed or disturbed.
According to the park administration, keep at least 100 yards/ meter from bears and wolves and 25 yards/ meter from all other wildlife!
Despite their appearance of piety, bison, North American and European moose, bears, and almost all large animals can attack.
Each year, dozens of visitors are injured because they did not keep their distance.
Additionally, know that smells attract bears and other wildlife, so avoid carrying or cooking strong-smelling food, and keep the camp clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa, located on the island of Upolu, and has a population of just under 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s, and the title of the capital of Samoa officially bears since 1959.
The harbour was the site of a notorious naval skirmish in 1889 when seven ships from Germany, the United States and Britain refused to leave the harbour.
All but one British cruiser was sunk, and nearly two hundred American and German lives were lost.
During the independence struggle organised by the Mao movement, a peaceful gathering in the city resulted in the assassination of the supreme chieftain Tupua Tamaseces Lealofi III.
Since Auckland stretches across two harbours, there are many beaches, the most popular being those in three areas:
The North Shore Beaches (in the North Port area) are located on the Pacific Ocean and stretch from Long Bay in the north to Davenport in the south.
Almost all beaches are sandy with safe bathing areas, and most are also frosty with tree trunks.
Tamaki Drive beaches are in the port of Waitematā, in the affluent suburbs of Mission Bay and St. Heliers in central Auckland.
These are family-friendly beaches that are sometimes crowded, and with a rich array of shops that line the shore.
The main local beer Broj en is not a complex beer, but is pleasant and refreshing.
There are many French wines that are well tasted, but New Zealand and Australian wines may do better on the road.
Local tap water is safe to drink, but bottled water is easy to find if you are afraid.
For Australians, a coffee is a white double espresso with milk, a short black is an espresso, a cappuccino comes in a highly poured shot (not foam), and the tea is served without milk.
The hot chocolate meets Belgian standards, and the fruit juices are expensive, but exceptional.
Numerous trips to the reef are organized throughout the year, and injuries resulting from any of these causes are rare.
Nevertheless, observe all signs and pay close attention to safety warnings.
Quaternary jellyfish appear near the beach and near the river mouth from October to April north of the town, and occasionally can be found outside this time frame.
There are sharks, but they rarely attack humans, and most sharks are afraid of humans and will swim as far away from you as possible.
Sea crocodiles do not live actively in the ocean, their primary habitat being the river estuaries north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance gives the traveler the assurance that he will have a place to sleep when he arrives at his destination.
Travel agents often have agreements with specific hotels, although you may be able to book other types of accommodation, such as camping, through them.
Travel agents usually offer arrangements that include breakfast, provided transportation to/from the airport, or even a combination of flight and hotel arrangements.
They can also save your reservation if you need time to think about the offer or can obtain other documents you need for the destination you are visiting (such as a visa).
Any supplement or request should first be sent to the travel agent, not directly to the hotel.
At some festivals, the vast majority of music festival visitors choose to camp on-site, and most visitors consider it a significant part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the action, you'll have to arrive early to secure a camping spot near the music.
Keep in mind that while the music on the main stages may have stopped, there may be parts of the festival that play music late into the night.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with young children.
If you are crossing the northern Baltic during winter, check the location of the hut, since crossing through the ice causes quite awful noises for those most affected.
Cruise passengers are exempt from the visa requirement (check the conditions).
Casinos usually go to great lengths to maximize the time and money spent by visitors. Windows and clocks are generally missing, and exits are hard to find.
They usually have special food, drink, and entertainment to keep the guests in a good mood and to keep them in the facility.
However, drunkenness affects judgment, and all good gamblers know the importance of staying sober.
Anyone planning to drive over high latitudes or over mountain passes should take into account the possibility of snow, ice, or below-freezing temperatures.
On icy and snowy roads, the signal is weak and you cannot drive as if you were on asphalt.
During storms, enough snow may fall in a very short time to cause a snowstorm.
Falling or flying snow, as well as fog or ice on vehicle windows, can also limit visibility.
On the other hand, snow and ice conditions are normal in many countries, and traffic runs largely uninterrupted throughout the year.
The safari is probably the biggest tourist attraction in Africa and the highlight of the experience for many visitors.
In popular usage, the term safari refers to overland trips where you can see the amazing African wildlife, especially in the savannah.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to approach cars slowly, so standard equipment allows good visibility.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards are sometimes shy, so you will be better able to observe them with your two eyes.
A walking safari (also called a "nature walk", "walking safari", or "walking tour") consists of a walking tour, lasting a couple of hours or a couple of days.
The Paralympics will be held from August 24 to September 5, 2021. Some events will be held at other locations across Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to host two Summer Olympics, having hosted the 1964 Games.
If you booked your flights and accommodations for 2020 before the delay was announced, you may find yourself in an awkward situation.
Cancellation policies vary, but as of late March, most coronavirus cancellation policies do not apply until July 2020, when the Olympic Games are scheduled.
The expected price of most tickets for the events will range from 2,500 to 130,000 Japanese yen, and the price of a typical ticket will be about 7,000 yen.
Many hotels offer rental ironing boards and ironing boards, even if you do not have them in your room.
If you do not have access to a pen, or if you do not like to wear penny socks, then you can try using a hair dryer, if available.
Be careful not to let the fabric become too warm (which can lead to clumping or, in extreme cases, abrasion).
There are several ways to purify water, some of which are more effective than some of the others.
In some areas, boiling water for one minute is sufficient; in others, it takes several minutes.
Filters vary in effectiveness, and if you are concerned, you should consider buying water from reputable companies in a sealed bottle.
Travelers may encounter pests not familiar with their native regions.
Harmful pollutants can spoil food, cause irritation, or in the worst cases cause allergic reactions, widespread poisoning, or transmit infections.
Infectious diseases or dangerous animals that can brute or kill humans do not usually turn into pests.
Duty-free shopping is an opportunity to buy goods exempt from taxes and excise duties at certain locations.
Travelers to countries with high taxes can sometimes save a considerable amount of money, especially on items such as alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The route between Point Marion and Fairmont provides the most challenging driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh freeway, as it often passes through isolated rural countrysides.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, be prepared to react quickly: steep slopes, narrow lanes, and sharp curves dominate.
The posted speed limits are noticeably lower than on previous and subsequent sections  usually 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h)  and their strict observance is even more important than otherwise.
Interestingly, however, the cell phone network is much stronger here than along many other sections of the road, such as the Pennsylvania Wilderness.
German pastries are quite good, and in Bavaria they are quite rich and varied, much like those of its southern neighbor, Austria.
Night baking is frequent, with apples baked throughout the year, while cherries and plums appear during the summer.
Many German bakery products also contain almonds, hazelnuts, and other nuts.
If you want some small but rich pastries, try what is called berliner, fancuchen, or kraffen, depending on the region.
Curry is a dish based on herbs and spices combined with meat or vegetables.
The curry can be either dry or wet, depending on the amount of liquid.
In the interior areas of northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is commonly used in curries; in southern India and some coastal areas of the subcontinent, coconut milk is commonly used.
With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian food is a general term that encompasses a wide range of regional cuisines throughout the country.
But when used without additional qualifiers, the term usually denotes foods originating in the central and eastern part of the main island of Java.
Now available throughout the archipelago, Javanese cuisine contains a rich array of simply seasoned dishes, among which are the predominant flavours that Javanese prefer such as peanuts, chillies, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar) and various aromatic spices.
Uzzengis are the supports for the rider's feet that hang from both sides of the saddle.
They provide greater stability to the rider, but can pose a safety problem due to the possibility of the rider getting stuck in them.
If a rider is thrown from a horse but his foot gets stuck in the stirrup, he can be pulled out if the horse continues to run.
First of all, most riders wear riding boots, with a heel and a smooth, fairly narrow heel.
Then, some saddles, especially English saddles, have safety barriers that allow the leather strap to fall off the saddle if the rider pulls it at the moment of the fall.
The Cochamo Valley - Chile's main climbing destination, known as the Yosemite of South America, with numerous large granite walls and cliffs.
Mountaineers from all over the world are constantly establishing new routes among the unseen potentials of the mountain's sides.
Snow mountain sports, which include skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports involving descending a snow-covered terrain on skis or a snowboard attached to your feet.
Skiing is the main activity during the trip, and many enthusiasts, often known as "skiers' misses", plan entire holidays spent skiing at a particular location.
The idea of skiing is extremely old - cave paintings depicting skiers date back as far as 5000 B.C.E.!
Alpine skiing as a sport has existed since at least the 17th century, and in 1861 the first recreational ski club was opened by Norwegians in Australia.
Ski-touring: This activity is often called cross-country skiing, ski touring, or ski-walking.
It is related to, but does not usually include, ski-touring or alpine-style mountaineering; the latter is performed on steep terrain and requires much tougher skis and boots.
Think of a skiing route as being similar to a hiking route.
In good conditions you will be able to cover a little more distance than on foot  but very rarely will you reach the speed of Nordic skiing without a heavy bag along the groomed trails.
Europe is a relatively small continent, but with many independent states. Under normal circumstances, traveling through several countries would mean having to pass through visa and passport controls several times.
In this respect, however, the Schengen Area functions much like a single state.
As long as you remain in this zone, you can generally cross the border without passing through passport controls again.
Similarly, when you have a Schengen visa, you do not have to apply for visas for each Schengen State separately, which saves time, money, and paperwork.
There is no universal definition by which manufactured items are considered antiques. Some tax agencies define products older than 100 years as antiques.
The definition has geographical variations, where the age limit might be shorter in places such as North America relative to Europe.
Handmade items can be defined as antiques, although they are younger than some similar mass-produced items.
The cultivation of the irvas is important to the life of the Lapons, and the culture of the trade is also important to many who are involved in other professions.
Even traditionally, however, not all Sami were largely dedicated to raising irwas, but lived from fishing, hunting and similar activities, and irwas were mainly used for hauling and carrying loads.
Today, many Lapons are engaged in modern crafts, and tourism is a major source of income in Lapland, a region in the Lapland region.
Although common, especially outside the Roma community, the word ciganin is often considered offensive because it arouses negative stereotypes and wrong conclusions about the Roma.
If the country you are visiting becomes subject to travel recommendations, it may affect your health insurance or travel insurance.
You may also want to listen to the advice of the governments of other countries, but their advice is for their citizens.
For example, American citizens in the Middle East may face different scenarios from Europeans or Arabs.
The reports are just a brief summary of the political situation in a country.
The views presented are often superficial, general, and simplified in relation to the more detailed information available elsewhere.
Bad weather is a generic term for any dangerous weather phenomenon that has the potential to cause damage, serious social disruption, or result in loss of human life.
Bad weather can occur anywhere in the world, and there are different types depending on geography, topography, and atmospheric conditions.
Strong winds, hail, excessive rainfall, and forest fires are both forms and effects of severe weather, as are thunderstorms, tornadoes, floods, and cyclones.
Regional and seasonal hazardous weather phenomena include blizzards, snowstorms, ice storms, and sandstorms.
Travelers are strongly advised to be aware of the risks of bad weather in the areas where they are located, as it may affect their travel plans.
Anyone who wants to travel to a country that could be called a war zone would have to undergo professional training first.
If you search the Internet and type in "hostile environment course", you will likely be directed to a local company.
The course will usually cover in much more detail all the issues discussed here, mostly with practical experience.
The course will usually last 2 to 5 days and will involve role-playing, lots of first aid, and sometimes gun training.
Books and magazines dealing with survival in the wild are common, but publications dealing with war zones are few.
Travelers planning to undergo sex-change surgery abroad should check that they have valid repatriation documents with them.
The willingness of governments to issue passports that do not specify the gender of the person (X) or documents that have been updated to match the desired name and gender, varies.
The willingness of foreign governments to comply with this document varies equally.
Checks at security checkpoints also became much more intrusive in the post-September 11, 2001 era.
Preoperative transgender individuals should not expect to be let through the scanners with untouched privacy and dignity.
The cut currents represent the backflow of waves that break off from the beach, often present on a ridge or similar places.
Due to the underwater topology, the backflow is concentrated in a few deep sections and there can be created fast currents to deep water.
Most deaths are caused by fatigue while attempting to swim uphill, which can be unpleasant.
Once you are out of the current, swimming back is no more difficult than it is otherwise.
Try to aim somewhere where you will not be caught again, or, depending on your skills and whether you are spotted, you may wish to wait to be rescued.
Returning shock occurs earlier than culture shock (the shorter period is the honeymoon phase), lasts longer, and can be more severe.
Travelers who have had an easy time adjusting to a new culture sometimes find it especially difficult to readjust to their native culture.
When you returned home after living abroad, you adapted to a new culture and lost some of your native customs.
When you first went abroad, people were probably patient and understanding, knowing that travelers in a new country must adapt.
People may not expect that the travelers returning home also need patience and understanding.
The sound and light show in the pyramid is one of the most interesting things here for children.
You can see the pyramids in the darkness and you can see them in the silence before the show starts.
The sound of the tourist and the vendor are usually heard.
The Sphinx is set as the background and narrator of a long story.
Scenes are shown on the pyramids, and various pyramids are illuminated.
The South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, are claimed by many nations and have the most bases, with sixteen active in 2020.
The archipelago is located 120 km north of the peninsula. The largest island is King George with the settlement Villa Las Estrellas.
Others include Livingston Island and Deception where the flooded caldera of a still active volcano provides a spectacular natural harbor.
Ellsworth Land is a region in the south of the peninsula, surrounded by the Bellinghausen Sea.
Here the peninsular mountains merge into the high plateau, then re-emerge to form the 360 km chain of Ellsworth Mountain, bisected by the Minnesota Glacier.
The northern part of the Sentinel Range contains the highest mountain in Antarctica, the Vinson Massif, with the highest peak, Vinson, reaching 4,892 m (18,832 ft).
In remote locations where there is no cell phone coverage, a satellite phone may be your only option.
A satellite phone is not usually a replacement for a mobile phone, since to make a call, you must be out in the open and have a satellite in clear view.
This service is often used for travel by ship, including yacht, as well as for expeditions that have remote data and voice needs.
Your local telephone service provider should be able to provide more information about connecting to this service.
An increasingly popular option for those planning a year off is to travel and study.
This is especially popular with those finishing school, as it allows them to take a year off before college without jeopardizing their education.
In many cases, taking a course abroad during a gap year can improve prospects for progressing to higher education in the home country.
There is usually a fee to enroll in some of these educational programs.
Finland is a great sailing destination. The "Land of a Thousand Lakes" also has thousands of islands, in lakes and on coastal archipelagos.
You do not need a yacht to sail around the archipelago and the lakes.
While the nearby archipelagos and the largest lakes are indeed big enough for any yacht, smaller boats or even kayaks offer a different experience.
Boating is a national pastime in Finland, with a boat for every seven or eight people.
This is matched by Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but is otherwise very unique (e.g. in the Netherlands the number is from one to forty).
Most of the various Baltic cruises have extended berths in St. Petersburg, Russia.
This means that you can visit the historic city for a couple of full days and then return and sleep on board during the night.
If you go to the coast only as part of boat trips, you do not need a special visa (as of 2009).
As you can see in the map above, Berlin is not even close to the sea, and a visit to the city is not included in the price of the cruise.
Air travel can be a frightening experience for people of all backgrounds and age groups, especially if they have never flown before or have experienced a traumatic event.
It is not something to be ashamed of: it is no different from the personal fears and reservations about other things that so many people have.
For some, understanding how the airship works and what happens during flight can help them overcome fear based on the unknown or the inability to control events.
Courier companies are well paid for fast delivery of items. Time is often very important when it comes to business documents, goods, or spare parts for emergency repairs.
On some routes larger companies have their own planes, but for some other routes or for smaller companies it was a problem.
If goods were sent by air freight, some routes may have required days to clear customs.
The only way to speed things up was to send the baggage as checked in.
The obvious way to fly first or business class is to spend a hefty sum of money for the privilege (or, better yet, to get the company you work for to do it for you).
This, however, is not cheap: as a general rule, you can expect to pay up to four times as much for a business-class economy ticket and eleven times more for first class!
Generally speaking, there is no point in even asking for discounts for business seats and first-class seats on direct flights from A to B.
Airlines know that there are certain groups of passengers who are willing to pay extra for the privilege of getting somewhere quickly and comfortably, and they charge accordingly.
The local language is Romanian, but Russian is widely used.
Moldova is a multiethnic republic that has suffered from ethnic conflict.
This conflict resulted in the creation of the self-proclaimed Transnistrian Republic in eastern Moldova in 1994, which has its own government and currency, but is not recognized by any UN member.
Economic ties were re-established between these two parts of Moldova, despite the failure of political negotiations.
The main religion in Moldova is Orthodox Christianity.
Izmir is the third largest city in Turkey with about 3.7 million inhabitants, the second largest port after Istanbul, and a very good transport hub.
Once an ancient city, Smyrna is now a modern, developed, and bustling commercial center located in a large bay surrounded by mountains.
Broad boulevards, glass-walled buildings, and modern shopping centers are dotted with traditional red-tiled roofs, an 18th-century bazaar, and old mosques and churches, though the city has more of a Mediterranean European atmosphere than a traditional Turkish one.
The village of Hallodarsk offers views of the nearby island of Eystroje, and has an unusual octagonal church.
In the church gates are interesting marble sculptures of pigeons over some tombs.
It is worth setting aside half an hour for a stroll through the intriguing village.
To the north and in close proximity is the romantic and fascinating town of Sintra, which became known to outsiders after a splendid tale of its wonders was recorded by Lord Byron.
The 403 bus runs regularly to Sintra, stopping at Cabo da Roca.
Also, in the north, visit the great Sanctuary of Our Lady of Fatima, a place known worldwide by the indications of the Virgin Mary.
Please note that you are visiting a place of mass graves, as well as a place of almost incalculable significance to a large portion of the world's population.
There are still many men and women who survived the ordeal here, and many more whose loved ones were killed or maimed to death, both Jews and non-Jews.
Please treat this place with the dignity, seriousness, and respect it deserves.
Do not destroy the space by making markings or by decorating objects with graffiti.
The official languages in Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish, and about half of the population prefer to speak Catalan, the vast majority understand it, and virtually everyone speaks Spanish.
Most of the signage is in Catalan only, however, as it is established by law as the first official language.
However, Spanish is also widely used in public transportation and other facilities.
Regular metro announcements are in Catalan only, but unplanned interruptions are automatically posted in a large number of languages, such as Spanish, English, French, Arabic, and Japanese.
Parisians have a reputation for being self-centered, unkind, and arrogant.
While this is often just a misguided stereotype, the best way to get along with people in Paris is to behave nicely - like someone who is bien élevé (well-behaved).
The unkind behavior of Parisians quickly evaporates if you show a little basic civility.
Plitvice Lakes National Park is heavily forested, mainly with beech, spruce and fir trees, and contains a mixture of alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
It has an extremely wide range of plant communities, due to its range of microclimates, different soils, and varying levels of altitude.
The area is also home to an exceptionally large number of diverse species of animals and birds.
Rare animal species, including brown bear, wolf, eagle, owl, lynx, wildcat, and great tit, as well as many more endangered species, can be found here
During visits to the monasteries, women must wear skirts below the knees, as well as cover their shoulders.
Most monasteries have a dress provided for women who come unprepared, but if you bring your own, especially one with bright colors, you will put a smile on the face of the monk or nun at the entrance.
By the same rule, men must wear trousers that cover the knees.
And you can borrow this from the storefront, but those clothes don't wash after every wear, so you might not feel comfortable wearing these dresses.
Majorcan cuisine, like those of similar Mediterranean regions, is based on bread, vegetables, and meat (particularly pork), and generally uses olive oil.
A simple popular evening meal, especially during the summer, is pa amb oli: bread with olive oil, tomatoes, and any available toppings such as cheese, tuna, etc.
All nouns, including the word Sie, which stands for the word V, are always written with a capital initial, even in the middle of a sentence.
This is an important way to distinguish between certain verbs and objects.
It can also be said to facilitate reading, although writing is a bit complicated by the need to determine whether a verb or a pronoun is used in the form of a preposition.
Pronunciation is relatively easy in Italian, since most words are pronounced exactly as they are spelled.
The basic letters to be considered are c and d, since their pronunciation varies depending on the accompanying consonant.
Also, try to pronounce r and r differently: kar means dear, while karro means coach.
Persian has a relatively simple and generally regular grammar.
Thus, reading this grammar would help you to learn much about the grammar of the Persian language and to better understand phrases.
Needless to say, if you speak some Romance languages, it will be easier for you to learn Portuguese.
However, people who speak a little Spanish may quickly conclude that Portuguese is sufficiently similar that it does not need to be studied separately.
Pre-modern observatories are largely obsolete today, existing as museums or educational sites.
Since light pollution in their heyday was not as much of a problem as it is today, they can usually be found in cities or on campuses, where they were more readily available than those built in modern times.
Most modern telescopes are huge installations in remote areas with favorable atmospheric conditions.
The observation of cherry blossoms, known as hanami, has been part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
The concept originated in China where the flower of choice was the plum blossom.
In Japan, the first cherry blossom celebration was organized by the emperor for himself and other members of the aristocracy at the imperial court.
Plants look best when they are in the wild, so resist the urge to remove at least one specimen.
If you are visiting a formal garden, you will also be expelled by collecting the usarak, and without discussion.
Singapore is generally an extremely safe place to visit and is very easy to get around, and you can buy just about anything upon arrival.
But since it is located in the high tropics just a few degrees north of the equator, you will have to deal with both heat (always) and strong sun (when the sky is clear, which is rarer).
A pair of buses also travel north to Hebron, where the traditional burial place of the Bible patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob and their wives is located.
Make sure that the bus you plan to take does not go only to the nearby Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba but also to Hebron itself.
Inland river routes can be a good basis for planning a vacation.
For example, a tour of the Loire Valley castles, the Rhine valleys, or a cruise to the sights of the Danube or a boat ride along the Irie Canal.
They also define routes for popular hiking and biking trails.
Christmas is one of the most important festivals of Christianity, and it is celebrated as the birth of Jesus.
Many traditions associated with this holiday have been adopted by non-Christians in Christendom and by non-Christians throughout the world.
It is a tradition to spend the night of the resurrection without sleeping, in an open place so as to see the sunrise.
Of course, there are Christian theological explanations for this tradition, but it is quite possible that this ritual of spring and fertility predates Christianity.
More traditional churches often hold Easter vigils on Saturday evening during Easter weekend, while communities often go out with a feast at the stroke of midnight to celebrate Christ's resurrection.
All the animals that originally arrived on the islands came here swimming, flying, or floating.
The great distance from the continent prevented the mammals from traveling, making the giant tortoise the primary animal grazing on the Galapagos.
Since the arrival of man on the Galapagos, many mammals have been introduced, including goats, horses, cows, rats, cats, and dogs.
If you visit the Arctic or Antarctic regions during winter, you will experience polar night, meaning that the sun does not rise above the horizon.
This offers a good opportunity to see the Aurora Borealis, as the sky will be dimmer throughout the day.
Since the areas are sparsely populated, and light pollution is often not a problem, you will also be able to enjoy the stars.
Japanese work culture is hierarchical and more formal than what Westerners may be accustomed to.
The uniforms are business attire, and the colleagues address each other by last name or nickname.
Harmony in the workplace is crucial, emphasizing group effort rather than praising individual accomplishments.
Often, workers must seek the approval of their superiors for every decision they make, and they are expected to obey their superiors' instructions without question.
