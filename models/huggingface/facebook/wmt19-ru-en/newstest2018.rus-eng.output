Russian President Vladimir Putin has signed a law on the introduction of administrative liability for violation of the term and procedure for payment for goods (works, services) in the course of procurement for state and municipal needs.
This law is intended to solve a very acute problem of non-fulfillment of obligations by customers in state and municipal procurement.
Until two years ago, the situation when entrepreneurs could not get paid under already executed state and municipal contracts was widespread.
At the same time, the President of Russia instructed the Prosecutor General's Office of the Russian Federation to take the problem under special control.
Because the businessmen themselves could not cope with unscrupulous customers who entered into unfunded contracts, tried in every possible way to evade their payment obligations, and included illegal terms in the contracts.
The problem was systemic in the country as a whole.
Since 2015, in order to protect the rights of entrepreneurs to receive payment on public orders, the prosecutor's office has made 9,700 recommendations, following the results of their consideration, 4,500 officials have been disciplined, 533 have been administratively prosecuted, 75 materials have been submitted to investigative bodies for the organization of procedural checks, and criminal proceedings have been instituted in 46 of them.
As a result, more than 66 billion roubles of debt to entrepreneurs was repaid.
And these huge sums have not been accumulated as a result of the non-payment of multi-billion dollar contracts.
Numerous, systematic delays in payments to entrepreneurs for far more modest amounts have led to staggering debts.
Here is a typical case.
The head of a small company won a tender for the provision of social transportation services for several million roubles.
The person invested all his working capital, fully fulfilled his obligations, but did not receive the money on time.
The result is a growing financial pile of debts on wages, taxes, and loans, which would have led to bankruptcy if the entrepreneur had not appealed to the prosecutor's office for help.
The problem has now been minimized in a number of regions.
Nevertheless, as of the first half of 2017, the total amount of debt under state and municipal contracts identified by prosecutors of constituent entities of the Russian Federation amounted to about 27.4 billion roubles.
In regions where debt indicators continue to reach critical levels, the prosecutor's office operates in a manual crisis management mode.
The Prosecutor General personally conducts on-site meetings with representatives of local authorities, at which all violations discovered by prosecutors and measures for their immediate elimination are thoroughly examined.
Such operational meetings have already been held in Yaroslavl and Yekaterinburg this year.
The implementation of Federal Law No. 189-FZ "On introducing amendments to the Code of Administrative Offences of the Russian Federation with regard to the establishment of administrative liability of the customer's officials for violation of the term and procedure for payment for goods (works, services) during procurement for state and municipal needs," which was signed by the President of Russia last week, will improve the payment discipline of public customers qualitatively.
The draft law was developed by the Ministry of Economic Development of Russia on the initiative of the Prosecutor General's Office.
The new law will supplement the Code of Administrative Offences of the Russian Federation with an article that provides for a fine of 30 thousand to 50 thousand roubles for violation by an official of the customer of the term and procedure for payment for goods, works and services in state and municipal procurement.
If the official has already been subject to an administrative penalty for a similar offence, he or she will be disqualified for a period of one to two years.
All procurators of the constituent entities of the Russian Federation have already been instructed to ensure the application of these legislative innovations in practice.
Civil rights group issues travel warning for Missouri
The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People has issued a warning for people of color traveling to Missouri because of the state's discriminatory policies and racially motivated attacks.
The group's statement reads: "The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People's Travel Warning, valid until August 28, 2017, urges African-American travelers, visitors, and Missouri citizens to be particularly vigilant and to exercise extra caution when traveling in the state in connection with a number of suspicious racist incidents that have recently occurred throughout the state and are cited here."
According to the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, the group was prompted to issue a travel warning by a recent Missouri law that made it more difficult for people to win discrimination claims, and that state law enforcement agencies disproportionately target minorities.
"You have people who are subject to human rights violations.
They are stopped on the roads because of the color of their skin, they are beaten and killed, "Rod Chapel, president of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People in Missouri, told the Kansas City Star.
"We hear complaints more often than ever before."
This is the first such warning issued by the organization against the state of the United States.
The group referred to incidents such as the racial humiliation of black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tori Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee.
Sanders died in suspicious circumstances earlier this year after running out of gasoline while traveling in the state, and Missouri State Police arrested him without charging him with a crime.
The warning also cites a recent report by the Missouri Attorney General's Office, which found that black drivers were 75 percent more likely than white drivers to be stopped on the road.
"The purpose of the warning is for people to be aware of the situation and to alert their relatives and friends and colleagues about what might happen in Missouri," Chapel said.
"People need to be prepared one way or another, whether they take the money with them for bail or tell their relatives that they are traveling across the state."
According to the latest data from the FBI's Hate Crimes Reporting Program, Missouri recorded 100 hate crimes in 2015, making the state the sixteenth largest in the state.
The travel warning is also a response to a new Missouri law that will make it harder to sue a legal entity for housing or labor discrimination.
Earlier, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) issued travel warnings for Texas and Arizona after those states passed new immigration-control laws that ordered local law enforcement to arrest people for violating immigration laws, which the ACLU said should have increased the number of racial checks.
Travel warnings are usually issued by the State Department for other countries, but civil-society organizations have recently resorted to this measure in response to certain laws and trends within the US.
Two killed in shooting at police patrol in Egypt
Unknown assailants opened fire on a police patrol in the Egyptian city of Isna, Reuters reports, citing Egypt's Interior Ministry.
Two people, including a police officer, were killed and three were injured in the exchange of fire.
All the injured have been taken to hospital.
According to the agency, the police stopped the car, after which two armed men in the car opened fire on law enforcement officers.
One of the intruders is detained, the other managed to escape.
Federal Tourism Agency supports the law on the abolition of free baggage for non-refundable airline tickets
The head of the Federal Tourism Agency, Oleg Safonov, said in an interview with the RBC TV channel that he "positively" regards the adoption of a law on the abolition of free baggage in the case of non-refundable airline tickets.
"It is necessary to create conditions under which a person who does not have luggage can buy a ticket cheaper than one who has luggage," he stressed (quoted by TASS).
At the same time, Mr. Safonov noted that, despite citizens "fears, there will be no need to pay for the transport of outerwear and mobile phones in hand luggage.
"It would be right to reassure all our citizens and tourists and declare this, to say that it will not have anything to do with outerwear, umbrella, mobile phone, iPad or even any computer," the head of the Federal Tourism Agency said.
Earlier, Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a law stipulating the right of airlines to exclude the norm of free baggage transportation in the case of non-refundable air tickets.
This means that airlines can determine the number and weight of baggage included in a non-refundable fare.
Vladimir Putin ordered to eliminate pollution in Baikal
Russian President Vladimir Putin, at a meeting on the protection of Baikal, reported that in recent years significant areas of the lake have been subjected to extreme pollution.
He ordered the identification of sources of financing, plans and implementers for the elimination of pollution.
Mr Putin also ordered a full-scale reclamation of the contaminated areas.
"It is also necessary to deal with the facilities that continue to operate here, the sewage treatment facilities of most of them are worn out," RIA Novosti quotes the President as saying.
He also added that the Prosecutor General's Office of Russia should conduct an audit to identify environmentally harmful activities.
According to him, there are problems in the area of the lake related to the appearance of natural landfills and a number of violations in the field of ecology on the part of the organizers of recreation.
"I want to emphasize this: it is not possible to check everything in succession, but it is necessary to know the measure here, but it is illegal and environmentally harmful activities and to take appropriate measures," he stressed.
Earlier, the Prosecutor General's Office reported a reduction in fish stocks in Lake Baikal and proposed to increase the number of facilities subject to environmental supervision.
Recall that on June 15, Vladimir Putin, during a direct line, stated the need to change the legislation to ensure the rights of citizens living in natural areas of a special protection regime.
Residents of Olkhon Island, which is part of the Baikal natural territory, informed him about problems with economic activity.
The head of the Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment, Sergei Donskoy, immediately proposed to solve the problem by clarifying the boundaries of the water protection zone of Baikal, but the Buryatia government reminded that such a change was not enough, as the restrictions were related to a number of regulatory acts.
Earlier, the Ministry of Economy proposed to solve the problem by amending the Land Code and the Law on Environmental Protection.
A new church will appear in Yugra
In the settlement of Sosva, members of the community from the small indigenous peoples of the North, "Rahtynya," together with residents of Berezovsky District, are taking part in the construction of an Orthodox church in honor of St. Nicholas the Wonderworker.
Its location is a riverbank, the temple will be clearly visible from afar, so it will serve as a guiding beacon for fishermen.
According to representatives of the community, construction work will be completed this year, domes have now been installed, and church bells are available.
The fleet's Igrim REB provided a transport escort.
The church is named after St. Nicholas the Wonderworker, because it is revered by the Orthodox Church as the patron saint of travelers, including fishermen.
In Sosva, on the other hand, fishing gives settlers jobs, feeds them.
Locals wait for the temple to open its doors, and children even write in school essays about it as a local attraction.
Disneyland with the death penalty.
Why does Singapore abide by the law?
I'm talking to a local businessman, Chang, sitting in an open-air eatery.
Commenting on the situation in Singapore, Chang smokes one cigarette after another, and carefully stores the cigarette butts in an iron box seized from his office.
After the conversation is over, the businessman heads to the nearest ballot box - a hundred meters away - and throws the bulls out there.
The fine for littering in a public place is 500 local dollars, Chang said.
You know, since I was a child, I just developed a reflex: you can't throw a candy floss on the pavement, they will immediately fine you.
And now cameras are everywhere.
Indeed, Singapore's sidewalks in the city centre are as clean as a museum.
Chang says that three months ago, his neighbor's 18-year-old son painted graffiti on the wall of an old colonial building.
The court found the boy guilty of vandalism and sentenced him to flogging.
What?!
Imagine.
He was hit ten times on the buttocks with a wooden stick and spent a week in prison.
Corporal punishment is not uncommon.
How Singapore combines the highest standard of living and incredibly harsh laws, was examined on the spot by an AiF columnist.
No one here thinks about abolishing the death penalty, "explains lawyer Victor Lee Hong.
And the government has long been spitting at the opinion of both the EU and the US on this issue.
If a person transports a large consignment of drugs or trades in them, a gallows is put in place.
In 2002, a 22-year-old Australian citizen was arrested at Changi Airport carrying 400 grams of cocaine.
He has been defended by the Australian prime minister, who has threatened sanctions, international human rights activists, and even the Pope.
But the guy ended up being hanged anyway.
After that, drug couriers diligently travel around our country.
The fact is that in Singapore, the laws are enforced by EVERYTHING, not just the humble and the poor.
It doesn't matter if you're a millionaire, a deputy prime minister, a famous artist, or a resident of the European Union.
There is only one option: if half a kilo of cocaine is found in your possession, you will be hanged.
When you walk around Singapore and meet a bunch of warning signs everywhere, you wonder how many prohibitions there are in this city-state!
For example, chewing gum is sold only in pharmacies and can be bought strictly on prescription (!) by a doctor.
A tourist will not be stripped of his chewing gum upon arrival, but it is worth sticking "gum" on the subway, and a fine of 1 thousand local dollars will be imposed.
In four days, I met two people with white signs around their necks: "I was rubbish."
In addition to a fine, a person is often sentenced to "banishment to the janitors" for throwing a gun past an urn: they clean parks and beaches for a week.
6 thousand roubles is paid by a "criminal" who forgot to flush the water in the public toilet, and when trying to alleviate a small need in the elevator of an apartment building, a special detector is activated - the doors are locked and a signal is sent to the police.
Exotic laws include bans on feeding pigeons in the street, public singing of songs, and even excessive watering of indoor plants (!): the abundance of water is thought to attract mosquitoes.
In order to avoid fires, smokers cannot carry lighters in the subway, otherwise they will be fined 5,000 Singaporean dollars.
In general, there is a thought: no matter how hard you try, you are bound to break something.
This is not the case at all, "Mohammed Kabir-Kajaria, the owner of a local travel agency, tries to dissuade me.
Particularly fantastic laws exist only on paper, and in the last twenty years I have not seen anyone prosecuted for violating them.
Why do they persist?
So that citizens do not relax.
Compliance with basic rules is strictly enforced.
For example, if a minor is sold cigarettes in a kiosk, everyone will be punished in a chain: the owner of the store will pay a huge sum, the violator himself will receive blows with sticks on the "back," and the seller will also be torn out and jailed.
It is precisely because of these stringent laws that offences in Singapore are rare.
Is this justified?
Back in the 1970s, we had chaos on the roads - motorists ignored traffic lights, drove as they wanted, got behind the wheel drunk.
After the introduction of fines for the year, everything calmed down.
Now the driver, having drunk a portion of whiskey, knows that if they stop, the policeman will not let go for a bribe, will impose a fine equal to the cost of the apartment, and will be sent to prison for years.
To many foreigners, the city-state in Southeast Asia seems like a kind of concentration camp.
In 1993, the American writer William Gibson called Singapore "Disneyland with the Death Penalty" - a guest from the United States appalled by the general wealth of its residents, its "eerily clean airport," and its "cultured nature."
They say that such things are unnatural, look artificial, and should not be so in principle.
It's early days in Singapore and you're rightly terrified of throwing a piece of paper on the sidewalk, stumbling over to the subway with ice cream.
But then you arrive at "Little India" and suddenly there's a "pattern rupture": plastic cups roll around the bus stop.
"How is that?" you wonder.
That's how it is, "the Singaporeans chuckle.
Anything happens.
Not every such "crime" will be caught on the spot, but you should know that if you are counted, you will not be ostracized, for you have broken the law.
More often than not, this is enough for a person to behave normally.
Of course, Singapore is quite authoritarian.
But you know what?
In Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam, I drove cautiously - motorcyclists often snatch smartphones and cameras from tourists "hands.
Downtown Paris is full of dirty bums and beggars.
On our streets, too, not everyone tries to throw garbage in the bin.
Singapore, by contrast, has become the quietest, cleanest, and safest city on earth, thanks to a set of draconian fines and ruthless (up to and including the death penalty) laws.
Think about it.
Such is human nature: remember, in Russia, no one was wearing a seatbelt at the wheel until they started to fine.
Although the main thing in Singapore is not fines, but voluntary compliance with the law.
And we should think that in Russia people would also welcome clean streets, no garbage in the subway, and would welcome the arrest of those who confuse an elevator with a public toilet.
So, thank you, no need for corporal punishment.
Otherwise, Singapore's laws are at least worth watching.
Nothing sacred?
Now the Trump White House is taking aim at the Statue of Liberty.
The surest sign of regime change is when it starts fighting the statues.
Americans understand this as well as anyone - hence the deliberate theatrical removal of Saddam Hussein's statue in Baghdad's Firdos Square in 2003.
Stephen Miller, one of the Trump administration's key ideologues, no doubt knew what he was doing when he wielded the symbolic axe over the Statue of Liberty during a heated argument with CNN journalist Jim Acosta about the president's proposals to sharply reduce legal migration.
To be fair, Miller did not attempt the statue itself.
Hordes of pleasure craft owners and artists depicting the Statue of Liberty would lynch him if he tried.
But he attacked its meaning, and especially that attributed to it in 1903, 17 years after the monument's completion, when Emma Lazarus's poems were added to the pedestal.
As Miller grumbled at Acosta, "I don't want to go deep into history here, but the Statue of Liberty is... a symbol of American freedom that lights up the world.
The poem you are referring to was added later and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty. "
Miller got the facts right, but as he said, it's not really about history.
This is about the current sound of Lazarus's striking words, the only ones in which the state invites not all immigrants, but the poorest: "Your tired, your poor, / Your mobs dreaming of breathing freely / The miserable scum of your plentiful shores."
Never before have "unfortunate scum" been so visible on our screens.
Miller was not a literary scholar - he made it clear that these people were not welcome in Trump's America.
This debate about the meaning of the statue is part of a broader political and cultural war: it is really a debate about the meaning of America.
Lazarus - and her friends who fought to have her words placed on the statue's base after her death - knew very well that they were committing a very political act.
The sculpture was designed to mark the link between the French and American republics with the help of a banal classical figure - the female figure of Liberty.
Lazarus changed her meaning: in her poem, the female figure is no longer abstract, she has a voice.
And she got a very different name: Mother of the Exiles.
Combining poem and image was a brilliant feminist move and a devastating attack on American nativism.
And as Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, the right did at least change it back.
The vociferous Rush Limbaugh, a kind of John the Baptist who heralded the advent of Trump, reasoned in 2010 that Liberty does not invite anyone, but rather is an early neoconservative who carries the flame of America to a world in darkness: "Freedom goes forward.
It carries the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world.
The torch is not needed to light the way to the US. "
Against Limbaugh's wont, it did hit a spot.
The meaning of the statue depends solely on the angle of view.
Lazarus's great creative achievement was to see her in the way that exhausted, unhappy, but hopeful people would see her on the decks of ships after a long and often arduous voyage.
This means literally looking at the world through the eyes of people seeking refuge and a chance at a better life.
Her statue answers them with the words of hope and hospitality that they dream of hearing.
And, of course, that is not a prospect that Miller and Trump will ever want to acknowledge.
Their torch is needed not to light the way, but to fuel the hatred that is their only source of strength.
World Cup 2017: Neil Blake hails Scotland's members of Team GB
Eilidh Doyle recalls a time when there were only two Scots on Team GB
Neil Blake, UK Athletics' performance director, said the 16-man Scotland squad for the World Championships would make a "significant contribution to the team's performance."
A record number of Scottish track and field athletes have been selected for the 2017 London Championships, which begin on Friday.
Blake believes "something special is born in Scotland" and the UK Athletics Federation should take note.
"We know that and we're trying to understand it and we'll support them as long as they have the potential," Blake said.
'I've spoken to people at the Scottish Institute of Sport and they think it has to do with what they've done.
The Scottish Athletics Federation thinks what they have done should be dealt with.
British Athletics: what they've done, we've got to work with it.
And the people on the street think the same.
I don't know why, but it's absolutely brilliant. '
Some of Scotland's track and field athletes are vying for medals, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart - who will compete against Sir Mo Farah in the 5,000m - while Eilidh Doyle has been made team captain.
"Eilidh is modest.
Her captain's speech was great, "says Blake.
"A lot of athletes, Scottish or not, and wherever they live or train, came out of this room feeling proud and determined to win.
The passion and sincerity that Eilidh put into it was remarkable. "
The Commonwealth Games silver medal winner, who will run the 400 metres steeplechase in her fifth World Championships, said the 16 Scots on the British team is "incredible."
The previous record for the number of Scots at a World Cup was seven, in 1983 and 2005.
Leading the way is Laura Muir, who specialises in middle-distance running and broke five British and two European records last year.
She will run in the 1500 and 5000 metres.
Chris O'Hare, who will race in the 1500m, is another Scot worth keeping an eye on: he has had a successful season behind him, with victories in the British team's qualifiers and the Anniversary Games.
Doyle recalls her first World Cup when Lee McConnell was the only Scot on the team apart from her.
The team captain says she is "incredibly proud" that so many of her compatriots are not only on the team, but in some cases will claim medals and fight to reach the final.
"The captain of the team is chosen by other members of the team, so it was a huge honour anyway, but to know that your team-mates voted for you and you were chosen is a very special thing for me," she added.
'Of course I'm very proud of all the Scots who made the team.
This shows how much we have achieved.
And they are all accomplished athletes who will aspire to get on the podium.
As for my captain's speech?
Yes, I think she was good.
I just noticed that we were very lucky to host the World Cup at home.
So it's just about how important it is to get the support from the fans and take advantage of being back in the Olympic Stadium.
I've got another chance to go out there and compete and the atmosphere will be fantastic. '
Blocking critics on Facebook: Don't run for public office if you're not prepared to listen to criticism from voters
The founder of our country understood the critical press.
Americans loved George Washington, but that didn't stop them from criticizing him for everything from domestic politics to his political principles.
Criticism of him was, of course, irritating.
But he has not silenced his critics.
Because as early as 1783, Washington said, "freedom of speech can be taken away and we, the deaf and the mute, will be led like sheep to the slaughterhouse."
Now I turn to Maryland Governor Larry Hogan, who should try to be more like Washington.
Hogan's subordinates blocked and erased the posts of at least 450 people who expressed their opinions on his official Facebook page.
And this week, the American Civil Liberties Union sued him for it.
The governor's subordinates called the lawsuit null and void, and the online comment was written in the spirit of "well and what."
"It's just Facebook," many will say.
But it is also important.
That's especially important when you're talking about a guy like Hogan.
He is a surprisingly popular Republican governor in a Democratic-dominated state.
He is second in approval ratings among the country's 50 governors.
Hogan is not a stubborn reactionary.
He has shown a strong hand in running the state and a commitment to his principles.
He also cleverly uses Facebook as a primary way to connect with his constituents, and jokingly shows off his balding post-chemotherapy head on his page.
So blocking people who come to the governor's page - which is purported to be an official public forum and run by administration officials with taxpayer money - is unnecessary and ultimately harmful.
In an interview with the Washington Post, spokeswoman Amelia Chez defended the governor's actions, saying blocking the comments was simply moderating them.
But it's all too easy to use the image of trolls, spammers, and haters riled by the Internet.
The Post spoke with some of the real people who were blocked by Hogan.
And it is the real people, not the trolls - the teacher, the businessman, the pastor - who turn to their elected leaders.
They all say their comments were respectful, informative and not rude.
The pastor quoted the Bible, appealing to the fact that Hogan is Catholic.
Lakshmi's lawyer, Sarma Ramana of Bowie, Maryland, did not express hatred, but asked about hate crimes.
"I wrote a polite comment saying that I was disappointed by his lack of response to hate crimes and other recent news," she wrote in the comments section of the Post article.
"I also don't like the idea that when a lot of people post comments on the same topic, some immediately say that it's a so-called hoax, instead of admitting that they are dealing with a large group of disaffected citizens."
What the governor's subordinates call a "concentrated spam attack," others would probably call an "active life stance."
In the Facebook era, it is easy to edit your image simply by blocking critics or erasing negative comments.
It is far less dusty work than before, when it required sending people, collecting and burning newspapers with critical editorials, or arresting and silencing protesters.
But that is exactly what is happening now, only in numbers.
Hogen is not the first official to be criticized for not listening to Facebook and other social networks.
President Trump has been sued by Twitter users who have been banned from his Twitter account.
One of the first, pivotal decisions on the topic was made this week in Virginia.
According to U.S. District Judge James C. Casheris of Alexandria, the Loudon County Board of Supervisors violated the First Amendment by banning a voter from his Facebook account.
And in Kentucky, Republican Governor Matt Bevin is being sued by the American Civil Liberties Union for his behavior on Facebook and Twitter.
It should not be that difficult.
In the days of Washington, the era of affordable postal spending was about as transformative as the Internet is today.
From 1776 to 1800, the number of newspapers quadrupled, and the authors of anonymous letters severely undermined his authority.
Even then, Washington was dealing with anonymous trolls.
People under the pseudonyms "Jurikola," "Valerius," "Belizarius," and "Portius" wrote letters to newspapers mocking Washington's decision.
According to historical documents collected by the online George Washington Papers Project, his office was inundated with petitions criticizing his position on the Treaty of Amity, Commerce, and Navigation.
But he was not trying to silence them.
Freedom of speech, dissent, and speech lies at the heart of our state.
And true leadership means accepting it.
Ronan Rafferty hopes for amenities at Renaissance club
Former European champion Ronan Rafferty is hoping for amenities over the next three days when the Renaissance club in East Lothian hosts the 25th Open Scottish Senior Golf Tournament.
The Northern Ireland native, who led next door at the Archerfield Links club and progressed to the final round last year before losing to Paul Eels, is attached to a new role representing the tournament on behalf of the club's founder and director Gerry Sarwadi.
"I've seen the Renaissance club build and we're seeing it succeed with this event," Rafferty said.
"The players will see this field at its best moment, it is in great condition.
Jerry has done a great job arranging this place.
He is an ardent supporter of the game and is proud of what he has achieved here.
It's a great demonstration for this field. "
Englishman Els is looking forward to defending his title for the first time, despite having won both the European Tour and the European Challenge Tour in his 32-year career.
"It's a really special feeling," said the Southport player.
"I couldn't try again to win the Extremadura Open because it was removed from the schedule a year after I won it.
To return to this corner of the world is magical.
It's a great place to play golf.
The memories of last year are coming back and for me and my wife Sharon it was a very special experience to win last year.
It was a really special time and we'll always remember it. '
Back in action on home soil is Gary Orr, who joined the European Senior Tour after turning 50 earlier this year.
The event will be his first public appearance in Scotland since the Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013.
"When you play at home, it's always a little more important," said Helensboro resident Orr.
'You want to perform well but you feel that extra burden. '
I enjoyed playing again and I played some good golf.
I'm happy with how things have turned out so far. '
The trio will be joined on the course by former Masters winner Ian Woosnam and Masters champions Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty.
Orr and former Ryder Cup captain Sam Torrance are two of the six Scots on the field; the others are Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmuir and Ross Drummond.
Entry to the tournament is free, and parking costs £5 an hour if there is one person in the car, and £10 if there are two or more.
All proceeds go to the British Prostate Cancer Foundation.
Britain's roads to learn how to absorb harmful emissions
The peculiar tunnels above highways that can absorb carbon monoxide emitted by cars are already being tested on UK roads.
The country's transport agency, Autocar, reported positive results from tests on a 100-meter tunnel installed on a highway in the north of the country.
The tunnel, which is 6 metres high, is built from some of the latest polymeric materials, which are capable of absorbing the harmful substances contained in car exhausts.
However, the creation of a network of such tunnels is only one part of the massive measures that the UK authorities intend to take to improve the atmosphere.
In addition to the tunnel network, the British plan to expand the network of charging stations for electric vehicles, implement a number of measures to reduce traffic on the roads, increase the use of electric commercial vehicles, and modernize the fleet of heavy trucks.
According to official statistics, transport accounts for a quarter of all air pollution, and poor air quality causes up to 40,000 premature deaths per year.
The Moscow City Court changed the penalty for a disabled Mamaev to a fine
The Moscow City Court has changed the punishment of disabled Anton Mamaev, sentenced to four and a half years in a penal colony, to a fine of 200 thousand roubles.
This is reported by TASS.
Earlier, the prosecutor's office asked the court to change the sentence to a suspended one, explaining its request by the fact that Mamaev's illness "prevents him from being in prison conditions."
Anton Mamaev, 28, was sentenced to four and a half years in a penal colony for robbery, the victim of which was a former special forces soldier.
On July 19, the court released the man from custody at an on-site hearing in the pre-trial detention facility.
Poverty and Death in Indonesia's Golden Land
Bardina Degei does not use a stove when cooking her lunch.
She rarely even uses a pot.
In her wooden house in Enarotali, the capital of Paniai district in the rebellious Indonesian province of Papua, a housewife usually simply places the sweet potatoes, called the "note," directly into the hearth.
Half an hour later, the charred tuber is removed and eaten with impatient, unwashed hands.
Degei sits on an earth floor - she has no furniture - and it is here that she does her housework, such as washing clothes with muddy water from a nearby swamp.
The toilet is a bucket in a room without a roof.
She is the youngest of her husband's four wives, so she was not assigned to work in the field.
Polygamy is rife here.
Of course, working late can be dangerous: many of the men in the village are unemployed, many drink, and there are still soldiers.
"No one dares walk around the village after five in the evening," she says.
It is a rare opportunity to look at daily life in the highlands of Papua, a former Dutch colony that was annexed to Indonesia in 1969 following a controversial referendum, when only 1,026 elders were forced to vote by raising their hands in public in front of occupying troops.
The current movement for independence from the Netherlands quickly turned its anger against Jakarta's government, which maintains tight control of the region by barring foreign journalists and human rights activists.
In 2003, the province was officially divided into Papua and West Papua, with the independent state of Papua New Guinea occupying the eastern part of the island.
Enarotali is as remote as it is abandoned; the journey involves an hour-and-a-half flight from Jayapura, the provincial capital, to Nabir, followed by a five-hour drive.
There is no public transport.
The town of about 19,000 people consists of wooden houses surrounded by bamboo fences; the roofs of corrugated steel are painted rust in a variety of reddish hues.
Few Indonesians made it here, let alone journalists, and almost none of the foreigners.
Before the arrival of Christian missionaries, Papuans worshiped a god named Uga Tamee.
There have been other changes.
"We were not used to wearing these clothes," says Degei, pointing to his bright, hand-woven turban, dark skirt and bright shirt.
"We used to wear only leaves on our bodies."
Papua is Indonesia's poorest province, with 28% of its population living below the poverty line, and child mortality and literacy rates among the worst in Asia.
But it is also Indonesia's golden land.
The world's largest and most profitable gold mine, Grasberg, owned by Phoenix-based Freeport McMoran, is just sixty miles from Paniai, a mountainous province about the size of New Jersey and home to 153,000 people.
In 2015 alone, Freeport produced about $3.1 billion worth of gold and copper here.
In addition, Papua boasts an estimated $78 billion in forest reserves.
This wealth, however, entails one misfortune for Papuans, ensuring that Indonesia's powerful military retains a suffocating presence there.
According to a New York Times investigation in 2005, between 1998 and 2004, Freeport paid nearly $20 million to local troops and units, including up to $150,000 to one officer.
Demands for greater autonomy by the Papuans threaten the existence of this golden sinew and are ruthlessly suppressed.
According to human rights activists, more than 500,000 Papuans have been killed by Indonesian military forces since 1969, and thousands more have been raped, tortured, and imprisoned.
According to the Asian Human Rights Commission, the massacres in the indigenous highlands of Papua in the 1970s amounted to genocide.
Last year alone, Indonesian police arrested more than 3,900 peaceful protesters in the region.
"We will lose everything," a report published in 2016 by the Brisbane Diocese contains evidence of atrocities committed in the previous year, such as extrajudicial executions, torture - particularly, another report claims, rape and electrocution - and violent repression of peaceful demonstrations.
"It's hard to count the number of victims because incidents happen every week," said Andreas Harsono, who researches Indonesia for Human Rights Watch.
The nuts and bolts have tightened as Papua's resources have attracted an influx of settlers from elsewhere in Indonesia.
The province's 3.5 million people are 83% Christian, but demographics are changing as Muslim economic migrants arrive from Indonesia's densely populated islands of Java, Sumatra, and Sulawesi.
Javanese stalls, "warungs," sell fried chicken and a mixture of gados and vegetables served with peanut sauce.
Locals are struggling to compete.
"Migrants have started to sell chicken and vegetables cheaper in the traditional market than the indigenous Papuans," explains Abet Yow, a 24-year-old native of Paniai who moved to Jayapura, the provincial capital, because of her job.
"As a result, Papuans - Papuan mum-mama (women) - have lost their market."
Indonesian President Joko Widodo, popularly known as Jokowi, vowed to address inequality and rights abuses in Papua during his 2014 presidential campaign.
On his way to the Presidential Palace in Jakarta, the former carpenter enlisted the support of 27 of Papua's 29 districts, including Panyai.
But little has changed in Papua, and locals feel betrayed.
"Our hearts are broken because in 2014 we voted for Jokowi, expecting him to fulfill our hopes for justice," Yow said.
In fact, just two months after Jokowi's October inauguration, Paniai experienced tragedy.
On 7 December 2014, a group of 11 children were outside singing Christmas hymns at a bonfire in Enarotali when two Indonesian soldiers on a motorcycle broke out of the darkness.
Terrified children told them to turn the headlights on.
According to local pastor Javedt Tebai, one of the soldiers took offense at their tone and returned with the four soldiers after a while.
According to victims and witnesses, the soldiers, who were drunk, chased the children and beat them with rifle butts.
Then one of the soldiers shot at a group of children.
One child, 16-year-old Julianus Yeimo, was beaten so badly that he fell into a coma.
A couple of hours later, someone set fire to a nearby government election commission building, and the situation escalated the next day.
About a thousand Papuan men, women and children gathered on a football field in front of a local police station and a military command center to demand justice.
They brought ritual hunting bows and performed Waita, a dance by the Mee Pago Papuan tribe, running in circles and mimicking bird song.
Some protesters began throwing stones at the police station and the military base.
As the situation escalated, soldiers were told by internal radio, "If the crowd resists more than three times, shoot them," according to an official document seen by TIME but not published in the local media.
Fifty-six-year-old Jeremias Kayame, head of the Kego Koto district in Enarotali, sensed danger approaching and appealed for calm, asking the crowd to disperse.
No one wanted to listen to him.
"When I turned around, a bullet suddenly hit my left wrist," he told TIME magazine, standing on the porch of his brightly painted wooden house.
Kayame still does not know who fired the shot, but says the bullet came from the direction of rows of assembled soldiers.
"There was a crowd, there were lots of shots," he adds.
Local resident Alfius Jove was shot three times, according to his cousin, who witnessed the shooting.
"I ran up to him and examined his body to make sure it was him," Johannes, who like many Indonesians uses only one name, told TIME magazine grimly.
"I saw he was dead... I kissed him."
General Yotje Mende, the chief inspector of Papua police, told reporters his officers were merely "defending" their base because it was under attack.
"We have to defend ourselves when people threaten to kill us," Papua police spokesman Pujo Sulistiyo said in 2015.
"It's a matter of life and death."
According to Human Rights Watch, five young protesters were killed and many more injured.
News of the killings reached Jakarta only the next day.
Three weeks later, Jokowi gave an impassioned speech in Jayapura, offering his condolences to the families of the victims and vowing to address Papua's historical abuses of power.
"I want this situation to be resolved immediately, so that it never happens again," he said.
In October 2016, Security Minister Wiranto said he would establish a non-judicial organization to put an end to historical human rights abuses.
But almost immediately there were excuses.
"Most of the violations occurred a long time ago.
Some occurred in the nineties or early noughties.
The fact is that we certainly want to address these violations, but there are procedures that need to be followed, "he said.
Wiranto then retracted his remarks, speaking to TIME magazine in Jakarta on June 5, and said he had no plans to establish a complaints organization in Papua.
Instead, he said, "Everything will be decided through the courts."
Wiranto, who was charged by the United Nations with "crimes against humanity" for the deaths of more than 1,000 people in East Timor's bloody 1999 independence vote, said 11 cases of human rights violations in Papua had already been resolved, including the Paniai incident.
Families of victims from Paniai received such statements with grim incredulity.
"I've been questioned four times in the last three years, but there's been absolutely no change," Johannes said.
"I'm tired."
Years later, he says, he still lives in fear.
"I'm scared," he says.
"I am afraid that I will be arrested by the military, I am afraid that I will be shot."
His brother Jacobus also suggested that the residents of Paniai were afraid to discuss the incident.
He said he was beaten by the military after helping bury the four victims.
"After we buried the bodies, the military came after me," he says.
The shooting has not stopped.
On Tuesday, Indonesian police shot dead villagers in neighboring Paniai district of Deiyai.
One person was killed and 17 others, including children, were injured in a clash between villagers and the manager of a construction company who refused to help take an unconscious man to a hospital.
The man, Ravianus Dove, 24, who drowned while fishing in a nearby river, died on his way to hospital.
Angry villagers protested outside the office of a construction site owned by the company.
According to police, villagers threw stones at officers, who responded with warning shots.
But locals claim that a mobile brigade (Indonesian special forces) opened fire on the crowd and killed one person.
"We were so panicked, we were afraid of retaliation," Dominggu Badia, 29, who lives near the hospital and saw the wounded being rushed to hospital, told TIME magazine.
"I hid in my house for two days."
The Deiyai Parliament demanded that the officers involved be held accountable and that the mobile police brigade be recalled from the region.
Panic has always been a sore spot for the Indonesian government.
The lack of meaningful development is causing resentment among the Mee, Moni, Dani, and Damal tribes scattered throughout the leafy central highlands of Papua.
Many have joined the Free Papua Movement (OPM), a rebel army that claims to defend the rights of Papuans by staging sporadic attacks and kidnap raids on Indonesian soldiers.
Some of OPM's top leaders come from Paniai, including Tadius Yogi and Daniel Judas Kogoya.
In retaliation, thousands of people have been arrested and arbitrarily detained by the military in Paniai in recent years under the pretext of "defending national independence."
Some never returned.
Among Papua's population, Paniai is considered a "sad, forgotten place."
Poverty exacerbates discontent.
A small portion of rice sold in Enarotali is too expensive for the locals.
Bread is equally unavailable.
People here grow everything they eat: mainly music, but also some fruit and leafy vegetables.
Agriculture is the work of women, each of whom can care for four or five fields of sweet potatoes.
Typically, they save most of the harvest for the family, and the rest is sold in the local market.
Ten tubers of the note cost just 10,000 Indonesian rupees (75 cents).
Over time, economic disparities have widened between indigenous Papuans and the new migrants who arrived in large numbers after the introduction of new flights to Nabire airport.
The few jobs that do exist tend to go to better-educated and better-off migrants.
Papuans rarely have the money or skills to run their own competitive businesses.
"Young people don't want to stay in the village... because there is neither work nor money," says John Gobai, chairman of the Paniai tribal council.
Isolation keeps Papua out of the eyes of the rest of the world.
Moreover, restrictions on the international media remain severe.
Earlier this year, French journalists Frank Esquudy and Basil Longchamp were deported from Papua for "lack of coordination with relevant organizations," despite being granted rare video permits.
According to Phelim Keene, deputy Asia director of Human Rights Watch, promises made during Jokowi's election campaign to lift media restrictions in order to promote transparency and development have not been fulfilled.
"Now foreign journalists trying to report from the rebellious eastern Indonesian provinces of Papua and West Papua face new dangers: visa denials and blacklisting," he said in a statement.
The lack of press attention means that international pressure on Indonesia's government is largely confined to Papua's immediate neighbors.
In March, six Pacific states - Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, the Marshall Islands, and Solomon Islands - asked the UN Human Rights Council to investigate "various and widespread violations" in Papua, including the shooting in Paniai.
The same countries have supported OPM in the past.
Indonesian Foreign Ministry spokesman Arramanata Nasir dismissed the group's statement, telling reporters in Jakarta that "Indonesia still has a democratic system and a free press, so it would be difficult to hide evidence of human rights abuses."
Locals want more foreign governments to take notice.
When an official delegation from the Netherlands, led by the Dutch ambassador for human rights, Kijs Van Baar, visited Jayapura on May 4, the locals broke their silence, pleading, "We want freedom," according to a source who also attended the meeting but wished to remain anonymous.
Indonesia will hold a new presidential election in 2019, but Papuans say they are unlikely to vote for Jokowi again.
"Jokowi is a man with good intentions, but he is surrounded by people involved in the Paniai shooting," said Gobai, chairman of the tribal council.
He wants Jokowi to know that the people of Paniai, apart from living in the shadow of a greedy army, are mired in poverty, and their education and health care are poor.
Gobai says Paniai residents, like other Papuans, view their vote for Jokowi as a debt that he must pay.
"They don't need money, they just want justice," he says.
Despite threats and intimidation, the families of the victims of the Paniai shooting carried out the last symbolic act of defiance: burying the body of one of the victims on a plot of land directly opposite the police and military station.
Knowing that justice will probably never be done, they will at least not allow the guilty to forget their crimes.
"They killed a member of our family," Jacobus says without raising his head.
"What else did we have to do?"
Fire engulfs Dubai's Torch skyscraper for second time
The fire engulfed one of the world's tallest residential skyscrapers in Dubai on Friday, forcing hundreds of residents to rush out of the 79-storey structure, 337 metres high.
It is the second fire to hit a high-rise building - coincidentally called the Torch - in two years.
The building was evacuated, no casualties were reported, and there was no immediate news on the cause of the fire.
"We were asleep and woke up to fire alarms and people screaming.
We ran down the stairs and it took us about ten minutes to get down from the fiftieth floor, "a resident of the skyscraper, who identified himself as George, told Reuters.
Fire crews extinguished the fire at around 04: 00 local time (00: 00 GMT) and cooled the building, according to Dubai City Civil Defence.
The government said it was working to provide shelter to the victims.
The incident could bring the safety of materials used in the exteriors of high-rise buildings around the world back on the agenda.
An investigation by the Torch administration after a fire there in 2015 found that the plating - the external panels used for decoration and insulation - had suffered the most.
In the United Kingdom, police have said they believe that the insulation and cladding panels of the Grenfell Tower building in London may have accelerated the spread of a fire there in June that killed some 80 people.
The growth of tourist traffic to Ida-Viru County in June was minimal
According to the data that the rus.err.ee correspondent received from the Department of Statistics, in June 2017, a total of 20,519 domestic and foreign tourists used hotel services in the North-East, which is 125 people or 0.6% more than in the same period a year earlier.
At the same time, the number of local tourists has declined, while the number of foreign tourists has increased.
Thus, the foreign tourist flow in June increased by 7.3% (544 people) to 7,994 tourists.
And the number of local tourists fell by 3.2%, from 12,944 to 12,525.
The most noticeable increase in the number of Russian tourists in the region was 8.9% or 318 people compared to June 2016.
In June 2017, 3,885 guests from the Russian Federation stayed overnight at Ida-Viru hotels.
Andrei Malakhov has let fans know who is to blame for his departure
Andrei Malakhov hinted to his fans on Instagram who is to blame for his departure from Channel One.
So far, he has not commented on the rumors, but today posted a snippet of an August 1 article in Vedomosti newspaper.
The photo Malakhov signed with the tag "boss of a milk pump."
An article on how to prevent employee burnout and pay attention to their condition.
If we recall the numerous reports that the presenter was unable to find common ground with the newly arrived producer, who undertook to reformat Let's Talk, it becomes clear what he so transparently hinted at, writes KP.
It was reported that TV presenter Andrei Malakhov is currently on leave and has not signed an application for dismissal from Channel One.
The firing situation could become clearer in the coming days.
Five soldiers killed in Afghanistan car bombing
At least five service personnel were killed in an explosion in Afghanistan's Helmand province, RIA Novosti reports.
According to police, a car bomb exploded last night near a military checkpoint in Girishk county.
Twenty people are known to have died.
On Friday morning, another accident occurred in Girishka.
Armed criminals attacked a currency exchange.
The exchange of fire between the attackers and the security forces continues.
The diver filmed the shark biting his camera
Diver and researcher Greg Skomal captured video of a shark biting his GoPro action camera.
The video was posted on Facebook by a unit of the US Marine Fisheries Agency in Massachusetts, of which Skomal is an employee.
The incident occurred on August 2 off the coast of the Cape Cod Peninsula in the northeast of the United States, the Necn portal clarifies.
A man while diving tried to film the shark on a camera he was holding on a special stick.
After noticing the man, the animal, which is more than three metres long, swam up to him.
The shark began biting the camera without attempting to attack the scientist.
Skomal explained that the predator did so to determine whether the gadget was edible.
The researcher added that the shark could easily have destroyed the device.
He also noted that this behavior of a marine animal was a novelty for scientists.
The reason for the mass brawl in the Ural military center became known
A working group of senior officers from the Central Military District arrived at the Elan Training Centre, where the mass brawl occurred, to investigate the circumstances of the incident.
Some details of the carnage have already come to light.
According to the Mash public information site, which appeared on the VKontakte page, contract workers of the Ural military unit number 31612 fought violently over an unfilled bed.
It all began with a private named Sayan defiantly ignoring the officer's order to fill the protruding sheet.
Soldiers from the Sixth Company sided with the officer.
Sayana was supported by the first company.
In half an hour, 140 young men smashed beds and sinks in the barracks, smashing windows.
More than a dozen people were injured in the mass brawl.
The CVO denied the information about the stabbing.
The study found that at least one-fifth of passengers in the US carry prohibited items on a plane.
The study found that more than 20 percent of airline passengers knowingly or accidentally carried prohibited items in their luggage through US Transportation Security Administration checkpoints, including at least 6 percent who inadvertently carried prohibited knives or other sharp objects on board.
Almost 1 per cent said they later discovered they were accidentally carrying a firearm, ammunition or explosives.
A study of more than 1,000 people by charter company Stratos Jet Charters, Inc. also found that younger passengers are more likely to break the rules.
Of the respondents who admitted knowingly trying to fly with something prohibited by ATS, 19.7 percent were millennials, compared to less than 15 percent of Generation X.
Consciously, food and water are often carried past ATS officers.
More than 3 per cent admitted to deliberately carrying sharp objects through security checks, while 2.2 per cent of female respondents and 3.7 per cent of male respondents admitted knowingly bringing prohibited drugs onto an aircraft.
The company said it studied passengers across the country to find out how many were accidentally smuggled through airport screening and how many knowingly did so.
Predictably, it is most often - knowingly or unknowingly - those who fly the most who smuggle the contraband through screening.
As the company points out, the ATB's rules are complex and confusing.
People often do not know exactly what liquids they can carry or how much.
So it is not surprising that much of what the ATB selects is banned liquids.
For a while, people thought that the ATS might consider banning books.
Liquids are permitted on domestic flights, but not on international flights.
EPA chief Pruitt abandons plan to delay Obama-era emissions-reduction rules
A day after the 15-state suit, the head of the Environmental Protection Agency reversed his decision to delay implementation of Obama-era regulations designed to reduce air pollutants that cause smog.
Pruitt attributed his decision to the fact that his agency is now more responsive to the needs of state environmental regulators than in previous administrations.
He made no mention of a lawsuit against his previous position filed in a federal appeals court.
The dispute revolved around the October 1 deadline by which states must meet 2015 ozone standards at the ground level.
Pruitt announced in June that he would delay compliance by one year to give his agency more time to study the plan and avoid "misalignment with local decisions or impeding economic growth."
Pruitt, who was Oklahoma's attorney general before being appointed by President Trump, has long been known as a consistent opponent of tougher environmental regulations.
Since moving to Washington, Pruitt has repeatedly blocked or delayed regulations opposed by the chemical or oil and gas industries.
Wednesday's unexpected change of course is yet another legal setback for Puitt's path back to normalcy.
Last month, a federal appeals court in Washington ruled that the EPA chief had overstepped his authority in trying to delay enforcement of an Obama administration rule requiring oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce methane leaks.
In a statement released Wednesday night, Pruitt suggested that by abruptly changing course on ozone standards, he was simply fulfilling the EPA's duty to work with the states to implement the new standards in a comprehensive and timely manner.
"Under previous administrations, the EPA often failed to meet deadlines, then waited for lawsuits from activist groups and others, and discussed deadlines as part of the settlement," said Pruitt, who filed more than a dozen lawsuits against the EPA in his previous position.
"We do not believe in litigation regulation, and we take the deadlines seriously.
We also take seriously our statutes and the power they give us. "
However, the EPA statement said Pruitt may at some point again use his "deferral authority and other statutory authority" to ensure that the regulations are "on a clear course and with all available information."
Congressional Republicans are pushing for a broader review of the ozone rules.
The bill, approved by the House of Representatives last month, seeks to delay implementation of the 2015 rules by at least eight years.
The Senate has not yet voted on the issue.
New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who led a coalition of states that filed suit against the EPA this week, said the group intends to continue the legal pressure.
"The EPA's change of course - after our lawsuits - is an important victory for the health and safety of 6.7 million New Yorkers and the more than 115 million Americans directly affected by the smog that blankets their cities," Schneiderman said.
New York's suit was joined by California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington, as well as the District of Columbia.
Ground-level ozone occurs when conventional pollutants from machinery, power plants, refineries, chemical plants, and other sources react with sunlight in the atmosphere.
The resulting smog can cause serious breathing problems in sensitive people, leading to thousands of premature deaths each year.
Health and environmental advocates welcomed Pruitt's sudden change of course.
"It's sad to think about how much pressure it took to get this perfectly logical step from someone charged with protecting the air we breathe," said Laurie Anne Bird of the Center for Biological Diversity.
"We must continue to resist the Trump administration's ideological campaign and protect air polluters and their special interests."
The IAAF Congress has extended the suspension of the All-Russian Athletics Federation
The Congress of the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) has voted to extend the suspension of the All-Russian Athletics Federation (VFLA).
So Congress backed the IAAF's board for rebuilding the WFLA, which issued a report on Monday recommending that the suspension remain in place.
166 people voted for the extension of the suspension, 21 against, TASS reports.
The IAAF Council report said the WFLA had made significant progress towards meeting the conditions set by the membership renewal board, but those conditions had not yet been fully met.
Due to the disqualification of the WFLA at the World Championships in London, Russian track and field athletes were forced to compete under a neutral flag.
The team included 19 people admitted to the IAAF championships.
The WFLA was indefinitely disqualified by the IAAF in 2015.
At the time, a report by Dick Pound, an independent expert from the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA), was published, highlighting numerous violations of WADA regulations by Russian officials and athletes.
For more information on the latest report of the IAAF Council, read Kommersant's "The IAAF has extended sanctions against the WFLA."
An Offensive Defeat
As part of the 3rd round of the Fonbet Championship of Russia among PFL teams, Novomoskovsky Khimik held an away match against FC Kaluga.
A little more than 10 days ago, the rivals played each other in the Russian Cup, but this time the picture was very different.
"Chemist" was in no way inferior to his opponent, but a second's relaxation at the end of the match led to an offensive goal and a fiasco.
After the recent 0-3 defeat by Kaluga, many predicted an easy victory for the hosts.
However, since the beginning of the meeting, the Novomoskovites have forced to reckon with themselves and acted on defense, but from a position of strength.
In the first half, the Kaluga people were more creative and had the advantage in possession of the ball.
Another very high-quality match was played by Alexey Sirotin, who several times repelled dangerous blows and by his actions gave his partners confidence.
Unfortunately, in attack, Khimik lacked the effort and luck to stymie Kaluga's defense and score the first away goal.
After the break, the game began to flow on counter-attacks.
Novomoskovsk residents played more actively in the attack.
Defensive errors were the wake-up call for our team, which allowed the Kaluans to create a number of sharp moments.
Ten minutes before the end of the meeting, "Chemist" intercepted the territorial advantage and carried out several dangerous attacks.
But the experience of the Kaluchans played a part - they spent the ending more competently and coolly, waiting for their moment to take the goal.
After a dangerous attack, "Khimik" moved the ball to the corner, the feed of which the hosts of the field passed without resistance to the goal.
The author of the goal was Yuri Dubrovin.
In the reporting meeting, "Chemist" demonstrated a good game, but suffered an offensive defeat.
Ahead of our team, another departure awaits - on 11 August at 19: 00 in Moscow, at the stadium named after Eduard Streltsov, the residents of Novosibirsk will battle the favorite of FC Ararat's Center group, which includes Roman Pavlyuchenko, Marat Izmailov, Igor Lebedenko, and Alexei Rebko.
Come and support "Chemist!"
The place and time of the meeting for residents of Novomoskovsk is 6: 30 p.m. near the Magnolia store (Vostochnaya str., 2, bldg.
Chemists: Sirotin, Manokhin (k), Romashchenko, Shayunov, Khomutov, Gogia (Oreshkin), Dudaiti, Ryzhov, Svyatov, Belyanin (Adoevtsev), Andreichenko (Lygin)

According to released transcripts of phone calls, Trump pressed Mexico on border wall payment
The Washington Post published transcripts of phone calls between US President Donald Trump and the leaders of Mexico and Australia.
On January 27, in a phone call with Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto, Trump insisted that he stop publicly declaring that he would not pay for a planned border wall.
The US president scolded him for speaking out publicly against the wall and, according to leaked information, told him, "You can't say that to the press."
Trump began his campaign with a promise to build a wall along the southern US border and vowed to make Mexico pay for the project.
A leaked transcript of his first phone call with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull also revealed a heated exchange.
Trump told Turnbull that the agreement for the US to accept refugees heading to Australia was "ridiculous," "disgusting," and "stupid," and insisted that the Obama administration's deal would make him look like an idiot because he intended to stop resettling refugees in the US.
Trump ended the conversation by telling Turnbull that "it was the most unpleasant conversation of the whole day."
Bodies of tourists killed in Abkhazia were sent by plane from Sochi to St. Petersburg
The plane belonging to the airline Rossiya, which carries the bodies of Russian women killed in Abkhazia, took off at 20: 15 Moscow time from Sochi to St. Petersburg, TASS reports.
Employees of the ritual agency, as well as representatives of the city administration, will meet the board at the place of the final destination, Deputy Minister for Resorts and Tourism of Abkhazia, Astamir Akhba, told journalists.
Earlier, representatives of the Ministry of Emergency Situations of the Republic stated that all costs related to the delivery of bodies back to Russia were borne by the Abkhaz government.
In addition, official Sukhum intends to pay compensation to the families of the victims in the amount of 500 thousand roubles.
According to Akhba, the leadership of Abkhazia expressed its readiness to pay relatives of the tourists killed as a result of the explosions for flights and accommodation in the republic, but relatives sent to the republic only power of attorney for the right of local authorities to act in accordance with the established procedure.
On 2 August, at approximately 16: 20 Moscow time, two explosions occurred in the village of Primorsky Gudauta District at the Ministry of Defence's rocket-artillery armoury, after which large-calibre shells and other munitions stored there began to detonate.
As a result, the warehouse caught fire, triggering uncontrolled explosions of various types of projectiles.
As a result of the emergency, two Russian citizens, Elena Polyakova, born in 1970, and Elena Timofeeva, born in 1962, who were on vacation near a hydrogen sulphide source, died.
64 people, including 35 citizens of the Russian Federation and 29 citizens of Abkhazia, were taken to medical institutions of the Republic with injuries of various degrees of severity.
Currently, seven people remain in hospital, the rest have been discharged.
Grand jury to examine Russian influence on US election
Special Counsel for Russia Robert Mueller has convened a grand jury in Washington to examine Russia's influence on the 2016 US presidential election, The Wall Street Journal and Reuters reported.
A grand jury is a group of ordinary citizens who collect evidence of potential criminal offenses and have the power to question witnesses under oath.
The special prosecutor will examine the collected material and decide whether it is sufficient to bring charges.
Convening a grand jury gives Mueller additional powers to collect testimony.
Details of a meeting between then-presidential candidate Donald Trump's son and Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya will be one of the topics of the jury's investigation, which began a few weeks ago.
Mueller himself had previously promised to verify the details of the June 2016 meeting.
They have already been examined by the FBI.
In late July, it was reported that Donald Trump Jr. had expanded his legal staff.
Trump Jr. has previously said that he expected the meeting with Veselnitskaya to compromise Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton's campaign, but no revealing documents were produced, and it ended up being about adoption.
In early August, a number of media outlets reported that Trump Jr. "s statement about the meeting with Veselnitskaya was literally dictated by Trump Sr.
The White House clarified that the president did not dictate anything, but simply used his authority, as any father would do.
Penza's vice mayor detained at work
Irina Shirshina, Deputy Head of the Penza Administration, was detained for 48 hours on behalf of the Investigative Committee at her workplace, RIA Novosti reports.
There have been no official reports from law enforcement agencies on this issue so far, but the press service of the UK Border Agency has assured that they will soon follow.
The Penza City Hall has not yet commented on the incident.
Irina Shirshina is one of the five deputy heads of the Penza administration.
She oversaw urban planning and land relations, a post she has held since April 2015.
Prior to that, she worked for a long time as head of the Department of the State Housing Construction Inspectorate for Penza Region.
Irina Shirshina is raising three minor children, it is noteworthy that once again becoming a mother a year ago, she gave up maternity leave and returned to work.
Of course, Mexico has neither a launch site nor a launch vehicle.
But there is a space agency, established in 2010, and a desire to develop its own space program.
And the installation of a bust of Yuri Gagarin is a tribute to the first person to have been in space.
Unlike monuments from the Soviet period, which are being demolished in some countries, monuments to Gagarin, on the contrary, "walk on the planet."
In 2012, a monument was erected in the US city of Houston near NASA's former headquarters.
In London, a monument on the grounds of the Royal Observatory was erected to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the first space flight.
There is a monument to Gagarin in Germany in the city of Erfoot, where our cosmonaut visited in 1963.
The monument in Karlovy Vary (Czech Republic) escaped demolition in 1992 thanks to public protests and was moved from the city centre to the square in front of the local airport.
In the year of Gagarin's 70th birthday, a monument to Yuri Gagarins appeared in Riga.
This is how the first cosmonaut's name and surname sound in Latvian, and it looks as if he is 70 years old.
Murder at Morse Ford: Activists lose Lynch trial on stage to call for justice
The 1948 Ford Mercury drove past spectators in Monroe Village, Georgia, and roared toward the small Morse Ford Bridge.
As the car, which had four black passengers and a white driver, approached the bridge, a group of white men with guns blocked its path.
The main one - a middle-aged man in a thin stripe suit - puffed on a cigar and looked through the windscreen.
Those inside trembled with fear.
"We need that nigger, Roger!" the man yelped.
"Get him out of the car!"
Shocking screams broke the silence as a young black man was dragged out of the front seat.
Fortunately, the gruesome scene, which took place on July 22, is just a staged one.
But when a noose was put around Roger's neck, almost everyone in the audience was really holding their breath.
Since 2005, activists have been returning to the Morse Ford Bridge to recreate the night in 1946 when the Ku Klux Klan lynched two black couples, Roger and Dorothy Malcom and George and May Murray Dorsey.
No one has been convicted of the murders.
"It's amazing that in all these years, not one person has been arrested - even though we see them next to us; even though we know who they are," said Tyrone Brooks, who helped organize the production.
"It is a stain on our history and a stone on our souls."
Brooks, 71, is a former Georgia congressman who has fought for human rights all his life.
For him, the show is a dramatic call to action and an annual reminder to the people of Monroe that injustice has never been redressed.
"We want an investigation, we want an end, we want healing, we want reconciliation, but first we have to get justice," he says.
"We cannot move to healing and reconciliation until we achieve justice."
A coroner covers the body of one of the victims of the lynching at Morse Ford on July 27, 1946.
According to FBI records obtained by NBC News, more than 50 people in Monroe and neighboring counties were suspected of participating in the lynching.
But no one was ever charged.
Although the suspects have remained at large for decades, human rights activists say the city has always been acutely aware of the two linked motives of the vigilantes: politics and sex.
In April 1946, the Supreme Court ruled for the first time that black citizens could vote in primaries that summer.
Around the same time, according to FBI reports, a black man, Roger Malcolm, stabbed Barnett Hester, a white landowner, in a fight, apparently because of a woman.
Brooks says rumors circulating in the city that Hester was sleeping with Malcolm's wife Dorothy, and that the baby she was due to give birth to was not from her husband.
According to the FBI, on July 25, 1946, Loy Harrison, a large white landowner, paid $600 bail to get Malcolm out of prison.
He went to prison with Dorothy and their cousins May Murray and George Dorsey.
But as they drove from the prison to the Morse Ford Bridge, a mob of vigilantes surrounded the car.
"It turns out that Harrison organized and commanded the murders," one FBI report concludes.
"It is also clear that there was collusion between state and city law enforcement agencies, who not only participated in the killings, but also destroyed evidence and withheld the identities of witnesses."
Brooks calls it short.
"It was an attack on voting rights," he says.
"They were all killed to send a message to black people in the city: if you register and vote, you will be the same."
For almost a decade, Cassandra Green has directed an annual play recreating that lynching at the Morse Ford Bridge.
Her performance is visually arresting and tells the story of a deep racism that many would like to believe no longer exists in America.
It's hard to watch and even harder to turn away, but Green believes that's what matters.
"We don't want to talk about Lynch courts because they show us our own ugliness," she says.
"But I can't build a relationship with you unless you hear me or hear what I've been through."
Rehearsals for this year's production began in June, and on the first day nearly 30 actors - a dozen white, the rest black - gathered indoors and listened to a polished review of the play over the years.
Wade Marbaugh was a director with Green.
He played the role of a senior clan member for several years, but says the role never got easier.
"I feel like I got dirty because it's not the person I am," Marbaugh said.
'But I think it's important to remember this story because we don't want to go back to that time. '
Inside, actors Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Ruscona, who play Roger Malcolm and Barnett Hester, are reprising their roles.
The play begins with Malcolm, furious that Hester is sleeping with his wife Dorothy, shouting and pushing him.
"I said, nigga, get out of my house!"
Rascona shouts in response.
There is a bang.
And at the same time, everyone (at least the black actors) erupts in laughter.
Green laughs loudest.
"What is it?" asks Ascona.
He is concerned and embarrassed.
Am I overplaying my hand?
"No," Green says with a laugh.
"I just don't think whites were saying 'nigga' back then."
"Yes," laughs one of the black performers.
"You've got to call it a hard 'p'."
And so does the energy in the room: discomfort is replaced by a sense of camaraderie.
Everyone must do everything right, not only for the sake of the play, but also for the sake of the memory of the four people who were killed.
The scene starts all over again.
This time, when Raskona says the word "n," it is clear and sharp.
No one is laughing.
The play ends cruelly and quickly.
Screams, shots, and then silence.
A woman in mourning black clothes stands over the bodies of the actors and performs the sad song "Strange Fruit" by Billie Holiday.
Her voice is interrupted by the word.
A hundred yards away, fifty spectators wipe tears and sweat from their eyes.
The audience is almost equally black and white.
One couple traveled from Ithaca, New York, to watch the show; many live nearby.
They all endured Georgia's heavy spirits for almost eight hours as Brooks led them on a pilgrimage to the graves of Malcolm and Dorsey.
Until then, the killings were only history, but now that they stand in the same place where they lynched people, it seems that their ghosts hang in the air.
When the last note of the song subsides, Green invites people to come closer and examine the bodies.
Children bend over to their heads, touch blood paint and still bodies, and whisper to each other.
"They're not really dead," mutters one little boy, as if to remind himself.
A few minutes later, Green thanks the audience, and all of a sudden it's over.
Actors throw ropes off their necks and wipe away tears.
Bradshaw hugs Marbaugh, the man in the suit who played the main puppeteer.
Nick Raskona embraces the other two actors and suddenly, weeping, falls into their arms: the emotional burden of the performance finally falls on him.
"It's all right," whispers one of the women.
"We know you have a good heart.
You had your reasons for doing so. "
Later, the audience sits down to dinner with the actors.
At one table, a white couple from Atlanta animatedly discuss the performance with a black couple they had just met.
Denisa Daplinsky struggles to find words to describe how she feels after the performance.
"It's hard to listen to those horrible, eerie words and actions... of people who look like you and who do it because they look like you," she says.
"After that, I think lynchings still happen," she adds, "but now it's called police shooting."
In the other corner of the room, Tyrone Brooks caught the attention of everyone, who recalled his work as a human rights defender at a meal.
He says he has already started planning for next year's performance.
"The production inspires us because it not only describes the horror of what we went through, but also teaches us," he says.
'Because if you don't learn from it, it can happen again.
Those who do not study their history, who do not know their history, are doomed to repeat it. "
The court fined Navalny for violations at the "campaign subbotnik"
Alexei Navalny was fined 300,000 roubles by the Simonovsky Court of Moscow for violating the order of organizing a rally.
The opposition leader was found guilty of committing an administrative offence under Article 20.2 (8) of the Administrative Code of the Russian Federation, "Repeated violation of the procedure for organizing a meeting."
Earlier, the judge of the Simonovsky Court of Moscow, Khizir Mussakaev, ended his consideration of the administrative case against Leonid Volkov, the chief of staff of opposition leader Alexei Navalny, who was prosecuted under the same article as Navalny.
Volkov was found guilty and sentenced to a fine of 300,000 roubles.
In this amount, Judge Mussakaev estimated the distribution of leaflets at the "campaign subbotnik," which Navalny's supporters held in Moscow on 8-9 July.
Having seen the campaign materials, the police who were following the participants of the subbotnik considered that the organizers of the event deliberately concealed its true essence - a public action (for which permission must be requested from the capital authorities in advance).
Leonid Volkov and his lawyers, Ivan Zhdanov and Aleksandr Pomazuev, petitioned to terminate the administrative proceedings in connection with the absence of a constituent element of the offence and pointed out that the police had made certain mistakes in drawing up the report.
Volkov was not detained at the "campaign subbotnik" itself, but he received a summons to appear at the police station to talk about the event he had participated in.
Navalny himself and another associate of the opposition, Nikolai Lyaskin, received similar summons.
Bride and three wedding guests shot dead in Mordovia
A court in Mordovia has arrested a local man who shot four people, including his bride, at a wedding.
This was reported by the Republican Department of the Investigative Committee.
The incident occurred on the evening of July 29.
During the altercation, a 42-year-old resident of Saransk shot several times at the guests of the event who had come to the village pond to swim.
Three women and one man were injured.
Criminal proceedings were initiated under Article 213 (1) (a) of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation ("hooliganism"), Article 30 (3) and Article 105 (2) (a), (f), (e) and (2) of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation ("Attempted murder of two or more persons committed in a generally dangerous manner, out of hooligan motives").
According to Interfax, local media reported that the man opened fire because guests of the wedding, having decided to swim, had passed through the territory of his plot to the pond.
Energy Ministry to tighten requirements for suppliers of turbines for power plants
The Ministry of Energy of the Russian Federation will update the rules for the provision of information by suppliers of critical equipment, in particular turbines for power plants.
At the launch of gas turbines, hydroelectric turbines, oil pumping and oil production facilities, equipment suppliers will be obliged to share data on access to it with the Ministry of Energy and the Federal Service for Technical and Export Control.
The draft resolution of the government is already ready and has been submitted for public discussion.
The new requirements will apply only to "critical energy equipment" supplied to Russia.
The document identifies such phenomena as obtaining information and access to the management of a facility by foreign intelligence services, criminal elements and structures, unscrupulous partners and hackers as potential threats.
EU expands anti-Russian sanctions over Siemens
On August 4, the press service of the European Union announced that anti-Russian sanctions had been extended because of a scandal over the supply of Siemens turbines to Crimea.
This was previously reported by Arguments of the Week.
The press service of the EU Council said that sanctions against Russia have been extended because of the scandal involving Siemens turbines, which were allegedly delivered to Crimea to circumvent the sanctions.
Today, the Council of Europe is considering all possible complaints and proposals by member states to expand anti-Russian sanctions.
Earlier it was reported that a final decision will be made by the end of this day, and now a decision has been made, sanctions against Russia have been extended.
Pearson cuts another 3,000 jobs and cuts dividends to revive business
On Friday, UK education group Pearson announced it would cut another 3,000 jobs and cut its interim dividend by 72 per cent as it embarks on another restructuring programme aimed at tackling the challenges facing its business.
These job cuts, which chief executive John Fallon has said will mostly occur in late 2018 and early 2019, are on top of 4,000 job losses from the previous restructuring.
Pearson announced that it planned to cut costs by another 300 million pounds ($394 million) in May as part of a third cost-cutting program to try to revive a business hit by the rapid transition to digital learning.
The company, which last month agreed to sell its stake in publisher Penguin Random House to its partner Bertelsmann, said its full-year forecasts remained unchanged after it reported a 1 per cent rise in underlying sales in the first half to £2.05 billion.
Kabul Convoy Attack: NATO Soldier Killed in Suicide Bomb
According to official sources, a suicide bomber attacked a military convoy in the Afghan capital, Kabul, killing one NATO soldier and wounding several others.
Five soldiers and an interpreter were wounded, NATO said in a statement.
According to unverified information from local sources, three civilians were also killed as a result of the incident in the urban district of Karabakh.
The bombing is the latest bloodshed to hit Afghanistan this month, with more than 30 people killed in an explosion at a mosque in Herat on Tuesday.
On Monday, a suicide bomber killed two people outside the Iraqi embassy in Kabul.
NATO said Thursday night's explosion occurred when a joint convoy with the Afghan army was attacked with a "man-portable improvised explosive device."
According to the report, all the wounded are in stable condition and are being treated at the US military hospital at Bagram airfield.
Correspondents report that the growing power of the Taliban and the group known as the Islamic State (IS) in Karabakh is a major source of concern for NATO forces stationed nearby in Bagram.
According to the UN, there were at least 1,662 civilian casualties in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017, with about 20% of them in the capital.
In late July, a suicide car bombing killed at least 30 people in Kabul's Shia district.
The Taliban said they carried out the attack.
On May 31, a massive explosion in the city center killed more than 150 people, the deadliest terrorist attack in the country since US-led forces ousted the Taliban from power in 2001.
The violence underscores the insecurity in Afghanistan, as US President Donald Trump assesses whether more US troops are needed to assist troops and police in the country.
Correspondents say the attacks in Kabul in recent weeks have also created a crisis of public confidence in the government, its line of conduct, and especially in the reputation of President Ashraf Ghani.
Environmental Protection Agency reverses decision to delay air pollution law after lawsuits
The US Environmental Protection Agency has reversed a decision to delay the passage of an Obama-era law requiring states to limit emissions of air pollutants, a day after 15 states sued the agency over the move.
On Wednesday evening, the Environmental Protection Agency announced its decision to implement so-called "ozone measurements 2015," stressing that the move shows the agency's willingness to work with the states.
"We believe in dialogue with and responsiveness to our state partners," Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Scott Pruitt said in a statement.
In June, Pruitt announced the Environmental Protection Agency's intention to delay ozone measurements, which measure existing air pollution in different parts of the country to determine where to reduce it to meet stricter air-quality standards, by one year, until October 2018.
On Tuesday, a group of 15 mostly Democratic states, along with the District of Columbia, filed a lawsuit arguing that the intent was illegal.
President Donald Trump's administration is trying to roll back a wide range of environmental regulations enacted by previous President Barack Obama as part of a broader agenda aimed at what Trump says is brilliant economic growth.
But action in this direction has drawn opposition from Democrats and environmental groups concerned about the possible health effects of high emissions.
The Environmental Protection Agency's website says breathing ozone-containing air "can impair lung function and exacerbate respiratory symptoms," such as asthma.
Association of European Business Opposes New Anti-Russian Sanctions
The Association of European Businesses has expressed its opposition to US economic sanctions against Russia.
According to the AEB, such measures could lead to a serious reduction in production and jobs.
The AEB statement says that business is one of the important links between countries and people, so the principles of free trade should not be restricted.
European business unites more than 500 companies from the European Union and the European Free Trade Association.
The Association calls on the heads of state and government of the EU, the United States, and Russia to develop a new course of action that would separate business from politics and find a common, mutually acceptable solution in a spirit of peace and harmony.
Deputies ask police to restrict traffic on the embankment in Pskov
The Pskov deputies sent an appeal to the head of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the city, Sergei Surin, about the problem of moving along the embankment of the Great River.
City Duma deputies Konstantin Bolotin, Grigory Storonenkov and Valery Lesnikov believe that motorists are preventing people from walking and having a rest in this place.
In their view, controlling drivers will help to make the area more peaceful and safe.
The problem is that trespassers ignore the "footpath" signs and ride freely along the embankment.
It turns out that major repairs and improvements were carried out in vain.
Sports grounds and children's playgrounds become uncomfortable because of cars.
According to the Pskov Information Agency, in the evenings, the central embankment is patrolled by PPS motorcycle patrol officers and police officers.
Thanks to them, the number of passing cars is reduced, but traffic is not completely stopped.
Putin demanded from the investigative authorities not to seize hard drives
Russian President Vladimir Putin has proposed to prohibit investigative agencies from seizing servers and hard drives from work computers at enterprises.
The head of state made this statement at a meeting on investment programs for the development of the Far East.
According to the president, it is necessary to "exclude the use of measures in the interests of the investigation that lead to the suspension of the activities of enterprises, including the seizure of hard drives from work computers and servers."
Putin noted that if investigators have such a need, "it is enough to take copies, certify them and use them during the investigation."
The head of state added that it is impossible to "create conditions that hinder the continuation of the enterprise's activities to the point that it is impossible to pay taxes."
Olga Buzova told how much she wanted to call her ex-husband
TV presenter Olga Buzova admitted that she really wanted to call her ex-husband, footballer Dmitry Tarasov.
The celebrity is currently in the US for work commitments.
Just the day before, Olga was in Las Vegas, after which she decided to post a post on the social network Instagram.
She said she never married, had new tattoos, or told her ex-husband that he had ruined her life, even though she wanted to.
Buzova said she will remember the trip forever because she had a great time.
British actor Robert Hardy dies
British actor Robert Hardy, who played Minister of Magic Cornelius Fudge in the Harry Potter series, has died at the age of 92.
The Independent reported on Thursday.
The actor's death was reported by his relatives.
They said he had lived "a tremendous life, achieving success in film, theatre and television over a 70-year career."
Hardy was born in 1925 in the English resort town of Cheltenham.
In 1959, he starred alongside Laurence Olivier in The Tragedy of Coriolanus at the Royal Shakespeare Theatre.
Hardy is also remembered for his many roles as Prime Minister Winston Churchill, including in one of Agatha Christie's screen adaptations of Miss Marple.
For his role as Churchill in the BBC television drama Winston Churchill: The Wilderness Years (1981), he received a BAFTA award from the British Academy of Film and Television Arts.
Robert Hardy also played the role of US President Franklin Delano Roosevelt more than once.
Something rotten in the Danish state: Prince Henrik, and in fact Henri Marie Jean André, Count of Laborde, refused to be buried with his crown wife, Queen Margrethe.
This year, the couple have a "golden" wedding, but on the couple's agenda is not preparations for the celebrations, but a bitter dispute.
His Highness renounced the title of Prince Consort, and he lambasted the Queen for never conferring on him the title of King Consort.
Henrik lives in France, though he remains officially the Queen's consort.
Russia's MFA urges Washington to stop smearing Moscow
The Russian Foreign Ministry reacted to Mike Pence's remarks accusing Moscow of trying to destabilize the Balkans.
The relevant statement was issued by the Foreign Ministry some time ago.
In its commentary, the Foreign Ministry pointed out that the United States is increasingly using Cold War clichés that are inadequate to modern reality.
In addition, Russian diplomats called on the American authorities to stop defaming the Russian Federation.
As "Arguments of the Week" wrote the day before, US Vice President Mike Pence accused Moscow of trying to destabilize the Western Balkans and orchestrate a failed coup d "état in Montenegro.
Mikey Garcia and Vasyl Lomachenko meet for the first time, there is talk about the possibility of a decisive fight
Vasyl Lomachenko and Mikey Garcia, who appear to be on track to stage the most exciting 147-pound boxing match in the near future, met for the first time on Thursday.
They occupied separate rooms in the offices of ESPN in Los Angeles until Garcia, the undefeated bantamweight champion of the World Boxing Council, walked down the corridor to greet Lomachenko, the WBA featherweight champion.
Following Garcia's unanimous victory over former four-weight world champion Arian Broner on Saturday on Showtime, both boxers are in the top five, regardless of weight class.
Garcia reached out his right hand and said: "What's going on, champion?
Good luck to you. "
Lomachenko defends his belt in a fight with Miguel Marriaga on Saturday at seven o'clock in the evening on the ESPN channel.
As the boxers posed for photos, Lomachenko's manager, Egis Klimas, noted that a potential decisive fight between them would be just the right time.
"I used to be featherweight," Garcia recalled.
'I went up in weight for Broner [to 140 pounds] but I'm not that big.
I'm not good enough for 140.
I want to go down to featherweight.
And he needs to get up to featherweight [135 pounds] and then we'll make a fight.
That's what the fans want.
Let's make it happen for them. '
Lomachenko agreed.
"Boxing needs this fight."
Klimas asked if the fight should be broadcast via the PPV service as part of the strategy he is pursuing for Lomachenko to make his 135-pound debut later this year to set up a meeting next summer with Garcia (37-0, 30 knockouts), who is also interested in fighting the winner of the bout between Jorge Linares and Luke Campbell after their world featherweight title fight at the Forum Arena on September 23.
"The fight could be on the PPV because all the fans asked for it," Garcia said, later expressing his willingness to fight on the channel that offers the best financial terms.
"We are the big names.
No other names will generate such interest.
As soon as they are ready... "
Garcia said he thought Lomachenko was a "terrific boxer" and might attend his Saturday bout.
But Lomachenko did not immediately showering Garcia with praise and said he thought the three-weight champion from Riverside looked "very slow, sorry, Mikey... you were coming for the knockout."
Garcia said he focused on showing the force of the punch and then boxing.
Both said they felt the tension building ahead of their own bout.
"This fight has to take place.
No other fight evokes so much interest and talk.
I'm more than happy to work on it, "Garcia said.
Lomachenko said: "I was waiting for one of the top boxers and here he is, Mikey.
It will be an excellent fight. "
Traffic will be shut down on several central streets of Moscow for the weekend
This weekend, 5 and 6 August, traffic will be restricted in the capital on the section of Tverskaya Street from Nastasyinsky Lane to Triumphal Square, as well as on the 1st Tverskaya-Yamskaya Street.

On all sections, the closure will operate on both lanes, reports the information center of the Department of Transport of Moscow.
The streets will be closed from midnight on August 5 until 5 a.m. on August 7 due to their landscaping.
Traffic on the section of Moskvoretskaya embankment will also be closed during the weekend.
There, the construction of the Zaryadye park continues.
Putin instructs Prosecutor General's Office to check Baikal
Russian President Vladimir Putin has instructed the Prosecutor General's Office of the Russian Federation to inspect the territory of Baikal for illegal and environmentally harmful activities.

In addition, the Russian leader asked for measures to be taken if the facts of the violations are revealed.
New test results to assess the age of asylum seekers in Sweden published
The latest test results for asylum-seekers in Sweden, who have been subjected to a new method of medical age assessment, show that more than 80 per cent of those tested were assessed as being over 18 years of age, but not everyone trusts the accuracy of these results.
The Swedish National Forensic Medicine Agency (Rättsmedicinalverket) began conducting tests earlier this year.
They were designed to make the age assessment of asylum more accurate, after the Swedish Migration Agency (Migrationsverket) was criticized for failing to determine the true age of some refugees who claimed to be minors.
So far, Migrationsverket has sent 6,880 cases for testing, and the forensic science agency has now published the results of 2,481 tests between mid-March and July 31, 2017.
Eighty percent (2002) of those tested were assessed as 18 years old or older, and in another 25 cases, the forensic science agency assessed that the person being tested was "probably 18 years old or older."
In 432 cases, the conclusion was that the person was "probably under 18."
Tests are carried out only in cases where a person's age is in doubt.
According to Johan Göransson of the Forensic Medicine Agency, the results are consistent with those of previous months.
"We don't see much difference from the statistics of the past months, the numbers are quite consistent," he told The Local.
The high proportion of cases in which people were assessed as having reached the age of 18 does not necessarily indicate that asylum-seekers have lied about their age.
In May, the agency released the results of 581 tests and said that in 442 cases, the "most likely age of the person being tested is 18 or older."
However, after examining 581 published results, the newspaper Svenska Dagbladet found that in 243 cases a person openly declared that he or she would turn 18 this year.
The method of medical age assessment, which consists in taking X-rays of wisdom teeth and CT scans of knee joints and submitting them to dentists and radiologists for analysis, has also drawn criticism in some quarters.
One skeptic is Claude Marcus, an endocrinologist at the Karolinska Institut, part of whose work is to assess people's biological maturity to determine whether they have gone through puberty earlier or later than normal.
'I had reasons to think about it and I don't think we should use the methods of measurement that are used now.
Biological age is thus very imprecise.
If we can't identify it with certainty, we shouldn't pretend we can, "he told Metro newspaper.
However, Göranssen of the forensic medicine agency has spoken out in favour of the accuracy of the tests: "In general, the risk of mistaking a child for an adult is small.
The biggest risk we face is when a person is about to turn 18, in which case they are about 10 percent. "
I will consider whether to run for president
During a working trip to Buryatia, Vladimir Putin said that he was ready to consider whether to run for the post of President of Russia in the 2018 elections, Interfax reports.
This statement was made in response to a request from residents of the village of Cheremushki, Buryat Oblast.
During a videoconference devoted to extinguishing the fire in Buryatia and Irkutsk Oblast, the interlocutor addressed Putin with the words: "Mr President, we ask you: when the next presidential election comes, we all ask you to run for this post again."
"Well, I think, thank you," the president said in response.
On July 28, Russian Presidential Press Secretary Dmitry Peskov commented on statements by some media outlets that Vladimir Putin's campaign headquarters would be headed by Chief of Staff of the Presidential Administration, Anton Vaino.
Peskov called these assumptions "based on nothing, hypothetical considerations."
"So far, there are no headquarters, the establishment of headquarters is far away, the election campaign is far away," Peskov said.
"So far, this is not on the agenda," Peskov said.
West Virginia governor says he's switching parties
West Virginia's Democratic governor, Jim Justice, announced Thursday at a rally with President Trump that he was switching parties.
"Like it or not, the Democrats have distanced themselves from me," Governor Justice said.
"Today I say to you with many prayers and many thoughts... today I say to you, the people of West Virginia: I can no longer be useful to you as a Democratic governor."
The rally erupted in applause.
"So tomorrow I will change my registration to a Republican," Justice added.
"As a coach, I would tell you it's time to play differently."
Earlier, Trump promised an important statement at a rally in West Virginia.
Trump won West Virginia by a margin of 42 percent, and Justice did not support the Democratic nominee, Hillary Clinton.
Justice, who according to Forbes is the only billionaire in the state, was elected in 2016.
Forbes notes that he owns coal mines in five states because he inherited the coal business from his father.
His fortune is estimated at $1.59 billion.
Meanwhile, the Republican National Committee released a statement Thursday night saying that "Governor Justice's switch to another party is another blow to the Democratic Party, which is obstructing rather than working to make our country great again."
"With only 15 governors and control of the fewest state legislatures in history, Governor Justice's announcement is just another rejection of a party that lacks leaders from top to bottom and is unable to find a positive, unifying message," Republican National Committee spokeswoman Ronna McDaniel said in a statement to CBS News.
A heavyweight cat nicknamed Mr Beautiful has found a home thanks to social media
A kennel in Pittsburgh, North Carolina, USA, has added a cat named Mr Beauty weighing more than 14 kilograms after he became famous thanks to the internet.
Mashable reports.
In late June, the kennel's Facebook account posted a photo of the cat asking to find its owner because "obviously someone had fed it before."
In the comments, users noted that the expression of the animal's muzzle could become a new meme.
The post received more than 3,200 likes and 15,000 comments.
In the comments, dozens of people expressed their desire to shelter Mr Beautiful.
As a result, he was handed over to Angela Frazee, who promised to look after his excess weight.
In an interview with WNCN radio, the American said that she had a similar experience: she took home a cat weighing about 10 kilograms, and now it weighs just over five.
In July, Reddit users noticed an Australian cat with unusually long paws.
The post with a photo of the animal has garnered more than 68,000 views.
Commentators pointed out that she could well have made a career in modeling.
Coe praises Russia's' sincere 'apology over doping scandal
International track and field specialist Sebastian Coe on Thursday praised what he called Russia's sincere apology in the wake of the doping scandal, but reiterated that now is not the right time to allow the country to compete again.
The Russian representative of the Athletics Federation, Dmitry Shlyakhtin, told the congress of the International Association of Athletics Federations, which took place on the eve of the World Athletics Championships, that his country's exclusion from sporting competitions was just and that he was determined to fight doping.
He apologized to "all athletes who had their gold and silver medals stolen from them in competition."
Despite his comments, the congress of the International Association of Athletics Federations voted to maintain the suspension imposed in November 2015 after the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) published a report on evidence of state-sponsored doping.
"I thought today's response, today's report, was very sincere," Coe, president of the International Association of Athletics Federations, told reporters.
"The whole council and the whole Congress liked... that the Russian Federation itself admits that it has been going through extremely hot times and is now doing its best to take care of the restructuring of the federation."
Coe said he was also "pleased" that Russia agreed to the criteria for its recovery.
"I think it was a very constructive day and we are moving forward, but Congress supports the recommendations of the special committee that now is not the time to restore Russia's rights," Coe said.
"Over the next few months, we must do everything to address this situation.
Our guiding principle was our desire to separate clean athletes from a tainted system, "he added.
Nineteen Russian athletes who meet the strict criteria of the International Association of Athletics Federations will compete under a neutral flag at the World Athletics Championships, which begin on Friday in London.
The head of the special commission of the International Association of Athletics Federations, Rune Andersen, said on Monday that a number of requirements have yet to be fulfilled to restore Russia.
As he told reporters in London after a report to the International Association of Athletics Federations board, drug testing is still inadequate and suspended coaches are still quietly doing their jobs.
The court arrested a Ukrainian journalist suspected of state corruption
Journalist Vasyl Muravitsky, detained by the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU), has been placed under arrest for two months, reports SBU.
An employee of the online publication Zhitomir Journal is suspected of treason by posting his publications on Russian websites and of encroaching on the territorial integrity of Ukraine.
At the same time, Russia does not support the measures taken by the Ukrainian authorities against the journalist, considering it a "barbaric policy" against the media.
Two years after the peak of the migration crisis in Europe, Italy has decided on a limited military operation in the Mediterranean.
The patrol ship Comandante Borsini entered Libyan territorial waters to join the Libyan navy in stopping the flow of illegal migrants.
The decision to launch the operation was taken by the Italian parliament on Wednesday.
Rome agreed to it with Libya's internationally recognized government, which, however, does not control much of the country's territory.
The anti-cabinet, Tobruk-based Libyan parliament has accused Italy of violating Libya's sovereignty.
And the commander of the Libyan National Army, Field Marshal Haftar, ordered his subordinates to confront the Italian ships.
Rome, however, has said that it does not believe these threats and intends to send another warship into Libyan territorial waters.
The situation was discussed last week in talks between Italian Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni and the head of the European-recognized Libyan cabinet, Faiz Saraj.
The Italian authorities decided to establish a maritime mission to combat illegal migration after statistics were released in July on the number of illegal migrants arriving in the country from Libya: 95,000 since the beginning of the year.
The government has said that resources to receive migrants have been exhausted.
The massive glitch occurred in Skype
A global glitch in the Skype service was reported today in several countries around the world.
Users on Thursday, August 3, began to send complaints en masse to the developers of the program.
Microsoft stressed that specialists are already actively working to eliminate the problems faced by residents of Europe and North America, RIA Novosti specifies.
Recall that in June of this year, Skype also suffered a glitch.
Users were unable to receive and send messages for some time.
Two leaders of the Ukrainian track and field team have been suspended from the World Championships
Olga Zemlyak and Olesya Povkh, who specialize in short-distance running, have been excluded from the Ukrainian team for the 2017 World Championships in London.
This is reported on the website of the Athletics Federation of the country (FLAU).
This decision was made by the executive committee of the organization in connection with the initiation of disciplinary proceedings by the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) against female athletes.
Coach Zemlyak Sergey Basenko was also excluded from the Ukrainian delegation.
As reported by Sportarena, the IAAF suspects the athletes of doping.
Povkh is bronze medalist at the 2012 Olympic Games and the 2011 World Championships, 2010 European champion in the 4x100-meter relay, and 2012 European champion Zemlyak in the 4x400-meter relay.
The World Athletics Championships in London will be held from 4 to 13 August.
How football's financial rules will affect Neymar's move to Paris
Rules aimed at preventing unlimited spending by European football clubs will not prevent the world-record transfer of Neymar from Spain's Barcelona to France's Paris Saint-Germain.
Any repercussions could come further down the line, for Paris Saint-Germain, from UEFA, the governing body of European football, which has the power to ban teams from the prestigious Champions League tournament.
According to the financial fair play rules introduced by UEFA in 2011, PSG will eventually have to show that Neymar's transfer was financed without major losses.
Barcelona were paid 222 million euros ($262 million) just to free the Brazilian from his contract, and Neymar will receive a salary that will reach tens of millions of dollars a year.
Here are some of the financial aspects of Neymar's move to France.
PSG could certainly splurge to hire Neymar and add him to the galaxy of other stars, given the team's financing from Qatar's energy-rich ruling family.
Clubs have the right to spend large sums to acquire players, but they have to balance that against legitimate sources of revenue in order to reach the threshold of profitability in their football business.
The FFP was introduced by Michel Platini after his election as UEFA president in 2007.
The former French footballer believed that clubs saddled with huge debts in their pursuit of success were, in fact, cheating and risking ruin if banks or owners stopped financing.
In 2011, the FFA stopped focusing on the clubs "debts and instead switched to tracking their losses.
As a result of this change, the business model that Roman Abramovich initially used at Chelsea in 2003 - to buy a club with good potential and then spend heavily to improve the team and build a global brand - has become difficult to implement.
Clubs could face losses of 30 million euros during the current three-year evaluation period, which runs into 2018.
And, despite Platini's ignominious removal from the presidency in 2015, his successor at UEFA, Aleksandr Ceferin, remains determined to rein in excessive spending.
"Of course, the FFP is alive and moving forward, we will tighten the rules," Andrea Traverso, who oversees the FFP at UEFA, told The Associated Press last week.
Although PSG will pay the buyout of Neymar's contract as a one-time payment, he can, for reporting purposes, spread that amount over the entire duration of his contract.
Neymar has signed a five-year contract, so the transfer value can be reported in the annual accounts as a cost of 44.4 million euros over the next five years.
During the first wave of sanctions by the "FFP" in 2014, PSG, as well as Abu Dhabi-owned Manchester City, were subjected to the heaviest sanctions.
PSG was fined €60 million ($82 million at that rate), which was later reduced to €20 million, and ordered to limit its Champions League squad for the 2014-15 season to 21 players instead of the usual 25.
UEFA is tracking clubs that may try to outwit its financial inspectorates by inflating their revenue at the expense of companies linked to the club's owners.
Although a Qatari company could sponsor PSG, if the amount of funding were deemed to be in excess of standard market rates, UEFA would not allow it to be considered legitimate revenue.
That is exactly what happened in 2014, when UEFA ruled that the Qatar Tourism Authority's funding of PSG had been inflated.
It has been reported that part of Neymar's earnings at PSG could come from payments by the 2022 World Cup organising committee in Qatar.
But PSG and Qatar 2022 deny that Neymar will become a World Cup ambassador, and UEFA inspectors could easily detect such a maneuver.
Past sanctions imposed on PSG mean that UEFA will be even more vigilant against any attempt to circumvent the rules.
According to people familiar with the situation on Thursday, UEFA has not held preliminary discussions with PSG regarding the transfer of Neymar.
They spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss PSG's situation.
According to the latest published accounts, in 2015-1016, PSG earned more than €10 million in profit on turnover of €542.4 million.
The accounts for the last fiscal year have not yet been published.
"PSG" expects that the arrival of Neymar will become fertile ground for sponsorship deals, the sale of paraphernalia and t-shirts with the team logo.
The club expects turnover to rise by at least 30 per cent following the hiring of a new player.
Undoubtedly angry at the departure of one of their best players, the Spanish league tried to thwart the transfer of Neymar by claiming that PSG would violate the financial fair play.
"This is a clear case of 'financial doping', with club and state," La Liga president Javier Tebas told Spanish newspaper AS, referring to Qatar as PSG's ultimate owner.
Arsenal coach Arsene Wenger, whose club is owned by an American sports tycoon, shares La Liga's doubts about state funding for the club.
"It is all the consequences of ownership and it has completely changed the landscape of football over the last fifteen years," Wenger said on Thursday.
"When a club belongs to a country, anything is possible.
It becomes very difficult to comply with the financial fair play, because a country can have many ways and many reasons to be represented by such a serious player.
The order and places of the oath of office will be determined by the president
Where and how new Russian citizens will swear allegiance to the Russian Federation will be determined by the president - such amendments to the second reading of the relevant law have been developed by the State Duma Committee on Legislation and State Building.
A week ago, the deputies planned to define directly the procedure for taking the oath of office in the law.
Children under the age of 18, as well as incapacitated children, will be exempt from taking the solemn oath, it follows from the revised text of amendments to the bill "On Citizenship of the Russian Federation" (available to Izvestia), which the committee will consider on July 11 before the second reading at its meeting.
On June 6, during a meeting with State Duma Speaker Vyacheslav Volodin, President Vladimir Putin supported the idea of introducing an oath upon becoming a citizen of the Russian Federation instead of formally signing documents.
Deputies formalized this idea in the form of an amendment to the second reading of the bill, which provides for revocation of the decision to grant citizenship to those who were subsequently convicted of a number of crimes of a terrorist or extremist nature: for example, for public incitement to terrorism or its public justification in the media or on the Internet (Article 205.2 (2) of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation), as well as for the hijacking of an aircraft, train or water transport, but only if this act is connected with terrorism (Article 211 (4) of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation).
According to the bill, its logic was as follows: when issuing citizenship documents, a person signs a promise to comply with Russian law - by embarking on the path of extremism, he violates that promise.
The bill was introduced to the State Duma in April by leaders of the Duma factions, Vladimir Vasilyev (United Russia), Gennady Zyuganov (CPRF), Vladimir Zhirinovsky (LDPR), Sergei Mironov (Just Russia), and State Duma Speaker Vyacheslav Volodin.
On May 19, the deputies adopted it in the first reading.
Last week, the State Duma Committee on State Construction and Legislation approved the text of the bill for the second reading, but it has now been revised once again.
Now it says that the order of taking the oath will be established by the President of the Russian Federation.
Earlier, the parliamentarians were going to describe the procedure directly in the law "On Citizenship of the Russian Federation," indicating that the ceremony should take place in a solemn setting in front of the national emblem and flag of Russia in the presence of a representative of the Ministry of Internal Affairs.
However, it was not clear from the text of the bill where such an event should take place - the list of places where the emblem of the Russian Federation can be placed is regulated by the relevant federal constitutional law.
These include courts, offices of heads of state bodies of subjects, municipalities, judges, prosecutors, heads of federal executive bodies, etc.
Most likely, it could also be civil registry offices.
Those wishing to acquire Russian citizenship will take a solemn oath after officials check their documents.
But a person will receive a Russian passport only after taking an oath, it follows from the revised text.
A week ago, the draft stated that the oath should precede the signing of the decree.
The updated text states that Russia's oath will be from the age of 18, not from the age of 14.
The rule that the incapacitated or those with limited legal capacity, as well as those who cannot pronounce, read, or sign the oath themselves, will be exempted from taking the oath.
In addition, the President of the Russian Federation has the right to exempt "other persons" from this procedure,
The updated bill also stipulates a special procedure for admitting Ukrainian citizens who are considered native speakers of the Russian language into the Russian Federation.
They will have to officially renounce their Ukrainian citizenship by submitting an appropriate application to the authorized body of Ukraine.
A notarized copy of the application will have to be handed over to Russian officials.
Renunciation of "alien" nationality will not be required, as it is now, if it is provided for in an international treaty or if it is not possible "for reasons beyond the control of the individual."
A corresponding amendment to the law was proposed by a group of deputies, including First Deputy Speaker of the State Duma Ivan Melnikov (CPRF), Natalia Poklonskaya, Pavel Krasheninnikov and Airat Farrakhov (all United Russia).
I think many of you know that it is impossible, simply impossible, to get a certificate from Ukraine.
Accordingly, a lot of people are waiting for a decision on their fate regarding citizenship of the Russian Federation, explained Pavel Krasheninnikov, Head of the Duma Committee on State Construction and Legislation (EP), the day before.
In addition, the text clarified that restrictions on the employment of certain posts for foreigners will not apply to those who renounced "other" citizenship in writing and surrendered their previous passport to the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Russia, but "for reasons beyond his control" he did not cease to be considered a citizen of another country.
Foreigners are now prohibited from holding positions in the municipal service and from being employed in facilities and organizations whose activities are related to ensuring Russia's security.
Also, a person with dual citizenship or a residence permit of another country may not become a deputy of the State Duma or a member of the Federation Council.
It is planned that the law should enter into force on September 1, 2017, by which time the necessary by-laws should be ready.
Nostalgia becomes niche in "Hot American Summer" and "Comrade Detective"
The current iteration of history nostalgically recalls both the characters "glory days in the 1980s; the grunge era in the 1990s (around the time that the great masters David Wayne and Michael Showalter made the sketch comedy" The State "for MTV); and itself - that is, 2001, before its stars like Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poehler, and Paul Rudd moved on to more serious things.
As a cultural fact, it is both an exaltation and an embodiment of our age, with its constant reminders from Facebook.
But as a franchise, it seems anachronistic.
"Camp Day 1" was surprisingly good, and not only because of its absurd humor (including the original story of a talking vegetable can voiced by H. John Benjamin).
The result is doubled by the main joke: middle-aged actors play sexually preoccupied children who have just come of age, making the impossibility of returning part of the joke.
"Ten Years Later," with adults playing adults, has less deep emotional roots, and its parody is more haphazard, incorporating riffs from 90s stalker movies like "Hands Shaking the Cradle."
In one episode, the character gets an Apple Powerbook, four-wheeled roller skates, and "a bunch of other things from 1991."
Many plot moves are the same.
The kind-hearted Coupe (Showalter), now a writer, still hasn't reciprocated from Katie (Marguerite Moreau).
Victor (Ken Marino) still hasn't given up his virginity.
And then there is the insane and dastardly plot involving Ronald Reagan (also Showalter), now instigated by George H.W. Bush (a tried-and-tested parody played by Michael Ian Blake).
As always, the best part of the franchise is stepping back from it.
It's especially funny to see the eternally young Rudd singing Matt Dillon's song from The Lonely, whose character, former big man Andy, now looks like an old man.
The franchise's success could be brought about by random insanity along the lines of the recurrent series Seven Up, until it reaches what I think would be its logical conclusion: "Hot American Summer: Twenty Years Later," in which, in the final scene, the entire company goes to the cinema for the premiere of "Hot American Summer."
"Comrade Detective" on Amazon appeals to a different type of nostalgia: Cold War memories from "The Americans," "Explosive Blond," or even "Glitter," with its images of East versus West struggles.
This comedy, created by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka and directed by Reese Thomas, depicts a television film: a Romanian police drama of the 1980s about two policemen in Bucharest fighting for truth, atheism, and the Marxist-Leninist way.
Starring Florin Piersik Jr. and Cornelius Ulitsch, Gregor and the idealist Joseph, their dialogues are performed in English by Channing Tatum (who is also an executive producer) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt.
It's a brilliant idea.
But only an idea.
There are some visual jokes (police officers spend time watching a chess match, like Americans might watch football).
A team of famous voices behind the scenes - including Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chloe Sevigny - allows you to play a fun game of "guess the voice."
But "Comrade Detective" so clings to the plausibility of a clumsy propaganda drama - there's even a Ronald Reagan masked killer - that it often looks like it.
Six long episodes are drawn out, and funny doesn't happen very often.
If it had been shorter, Comrade Detective could have handled his agitprop satire better; for example, every time Gregor and Joseph arrive at the American embassy, two thick men sit in the lobby eating a pile of hamburgers.
To an imaginary communist viewer, this image suggests that Western culture can make a fat cat out of anything.
The fictional Romanian authors of the film are not so wrong: we do so even with our own recent history, and with them, too.
The prize fund of the match between Spartak and Lokomotiv for the Russian Super Cup will be around 30 million roubles.
This was announced by Sergei Pryadkin, President of the Russian Football Premier League (RFPL), at a press conference.
According to the head of the RFEF, the winner will receive 70% of this amount, RT reports.
He also added that, so far, there are almost no tickets left for the match.
The Spartak-Lokomotiv match will take place on Friday, July 14, at 21: 30.
As TASS notes, Spartak is the current champion of the Russian Federation, and Lokomotiv is the owner of the National Cup.
Two young residents of Ufa cleaned the furniture shop for 200 thousand roubles
The other day, a 37-year-old resident of Ufa, who owns a furniture company, addressed the police.
The man reported the theft of expensive tools from the shop, which caused serious damage to its production.
Tools worth almost 200 thousand roubles, including two welding machines, a perforator, hydraulics, and a winch, were used to extract the thieves.
The guardians of order started searching for the criminals and soon came out on the residents of Blagoveshchensk district of Bashkortostan, friends aged 23 and 24.
According to the press service of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Republic, accomplices entered the territory of the enterprise, broke down the front door and carried out tools.
Immediately after that, the guys sold the stolen equipment to the first car service that got caught.
A case of theft has already been opened against them, and law enforcement officers managed to return only a part of the stolen tools to the rightful owner.
The State Department commented on Medvedev's words about relations between Russia and the United States
The US and Russia must be able to work with each other.
Such a statement was made by State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert in response to Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev's words about relations between the two states.
Earlier, the head of the Russian government said that by adopting new anti-Russian sanctions, the US ended hopes for improved bilateral relations and declared a full-fledged trade war on Russia.
Commenting on these words, Nauert acknowledged that Russian-American relations are at a "low level," but noted that it is necessary to look for "areas for interaction."
"Look at the truce in southwestern Syria, which has been holding for almost a month."
"And this is an example of good cooperation between the United States and Russia," RIA Novosti quotes the diplomat as saying.
At the same time, a spokeswoman for the Foreign Ministry declined to comment on the statement by the Russian prime minister that the sanctions amount to a trade war.
A bill on new sanctions against Russia, Iran, and North Korea was signed by US President Donald Trump last Wednesday.
At the same time, he admitted that the document is unfortunate and contrary to the American Constitution.
Dior "grew" roses from amethyst and quartz
The jewelry division of the French fashion house Dior - Dior Joaillerie - has joined the Rose Dior Bagatelle and Bois de Rose collections.
Five new rings and three choker necklaces on velvet ribbons were added.
The Rose Dior Pré Catelan line includes two new rings and a pendant made of amethyst, pink quartz, and diamonds, made in the technique of glyptic (hand-carved stone) and pavache, and dedicated to the 70th anniversary of the house.
The head of Dior Joaillerie, Victoire de Castellan, was inspired by roses grown on her Granville estate by fashion designer Christian Dior, and by the Parisian gardens Bagatelle and Pré-Catelan.
Trump finds culprits in deteriorating relations with Russia
US President Donald Trump has lashed out at members of Congress.
According to the US leader, their actions have led to a deterioration of relations with Russia.
Our relations with Russia are at an all-time low and dangerous level.
"Can you thank Congress, these same people can't even give us health care," the president tweeted.
The day before, Donald Trump signed into law new sanctions against Russia, Iran, and North Korea.
In particular, Russian banks and energy companies will be affected.
Subsequently, the White House issued a presidential statement in which it indicated that the law would prevent the US from making favorable deals and would bring Russia, China, and North Korea even closer together.
Belarusian entrepreneur refuses to buy Ukrainian daughter of Sberbank
Viktor Prokopenya, an entrepreneur from Belarus, withdrew from the National Bank of Ukraine (NBU) an application to buy a subsidiary of Sberbank.
The businessman explained his decision to RBC with the intention to "concentrate on our other planned investments and projects on which we are working."
According to Mr. Prokopeni, such a step would be "the best investment of time," despite the investment attractiveness of buying a subsidiary of Sberbank.
Mr Prokopenya became the main bidder for the purchase of the Russian bank's Ukraine division after the NBU rejected a bid from a consortium of NorvikBank's Grigory Guselnikov and the Belarusian company Said Gutseriev in July.
Russian banks began to withdraw from the Ukrainian market after President Petro Poroshenko imposed sanctions on their subsidiaries in March.
In addition to VTB and Vnesheconombank, Sberbank was one such financial institution.
Novak named the reason for the blackout in Crimea
The Ministry of Energy of the Russian Federation named the reason for the blackout in Crimea.
The head of the department, Alexander Novak, made an explanation of what happened.
According to him, the peninsula was left without electricity due to a traffic accident in Krasnodar Krai.
The truck involved in the accident hit the transmission line, as a result of which there was a shutdown of the Kuban and related Crimean networks.
Power outages in major Crimean cities were reported last week.
Specialists fixed the problems within a few hours.
It was initially reported that the blackout could have been caused by an abnormal heat wave.
Bank of England to keep interest rates at 0.25%
The Bank of England is expected to announce later that interest rates will not change after weak economic growth and weakening inflation dampened speculation of a possible hike.
The Bank of England has warned that economic growth will remain sluggish and left interest rates unchanged amid growing pressure on household incomes.
The Bank's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) voted 6-2 to keep rates at 0.25%, with fewer members voting for a rate increase this month because weak economic growth weakened support for a hike.
In its quarterly inflation report, the bank limited its forecasts for an increase to 1.7% in 2017 and 1.6% in 2018, and warned that pressure on household incomes will continue, while inflation is still expected to rise to around 3% in the autumn.
But the bank warned that rate hikes in the next few years would be needed to control Brexit-induced inflation, and said borrowing costs were likely to have to rise more than expected in financial markets.
Members of the committee also voted to abandon part of a huge package of economic measures launched a year ago in the wake of Brexit.
From next February, the bank will close its emergency funding scheme, under which it provides cheap loans to banks, although it has said it will now provide another £15 billion - up to £115 billion - as part of the plan.
In its rate-setting minutes, the Bank said: "The MPC's main forecast is that gross domestic product (GDP) growth will remain slow in the near term, while pressures on real household incomes continue to weigh on consumption."
On rates, he reiterated that stopping inflation would require "some tightening of fiscal policy," on a "slightly larger" scale than markets expect.
At the moment, markets are predicting the first hike in the third quarter of next year and another in 2020.
But the bank stressed that all increases would be "gradual" and "limited."
The bank's forecasts for an increase this year and next are lower than those made in May, which were 1.9% and 1.7%.
The Bank left unchanged its forecast of 1.8% in 2018.
Sterling fell against the dollar and the euro following the news.
The pound fell 0.5% to $1.31 and 0.4% to €1.11.
The decision not to change the rate came after recent disappointing growth figures dampened expectations of an increase; GDP then grew by 0.3% in the second quarter, compared to 0.2% in the previous three months.
According to the bank's representative, growth is likely to remain at 0.3% in the third quarter, although it will start to increase slightly at the end of the year.
The Bank's latest inflation report gave little comfort to households hit by high inflation and very small wage increases, which it said would intensify pressure before easing.
The Bank added that fiscal policy "cannot prevent" a hit to wages in the next few years, but expects wages to recover "significantly" by the end of its three-year forecast.
The economy is also set for growth as a result of growing demand for British goods, driven by the weak pound, which offsets some of the lower consumer spending.
The decision comes a year after rates were slashed to 0.25% last August in the wake of the shock result of the referendum on leaving the European Union, which caused the pound to fall.
The bank estimates that it will likely take four years to have a full impact on prices and the economy.
Before the Bank made its latest rate decision, there was growing hype about a rate hike, as inflation put increasing pressure on already under-pressure households, with three of the committee's members asking for rates to rise to 0.5% in July.
Inflation fell to 2.6% last month from 2.9% in July, although the bank said the fall was expected and would be reversed in the coming months.
The bank said the higher-than-expected 2% figure was entirely a result of the weak pound.
Andrew Montlake, director of mortgage brokers Coreco, said: "Given the recent fall in swap rates, it looks like the mortgage market will again become more competitive as lenders demand business opportunities and expect a good end to the year.
The market looks especially favorable for those who are nearing the end of their existing contracts, as refinancing loans, often with no fees and low rates, are becoming more popular than ever. "
NHS to prescribe controversial HIV drug to 10,000 people
From September, patients will have access to a "revolutionary" HIV prevention drug following a High Court battle over NHS funding for the drug.
NHS England has announced that Pre-exposure Prophylaxis for HIV (PEP), a pill taken before sex that has been shown to reduce the risk of infection in at-risk individuals by an average of 86 per cent, will now be offered by the health service for an initial three-year trial period to around 10,000 people.
She agreed to fund the trial after the Court of Appeal upheld a High Court ruling last year that the NHS could afford to pay for PIP, despite her claims that it should be funded by local authorities.
The move, announced on Thursday, was hailed as a "major innovation" by NHS England chief executive Simon Stevens, with the National AIDS Control Authority (NAT) calling it a "turning point."
Before the scheme is fully rolled out across England by April 2018, venereal disease clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will be among the first to start registering people, with many more joining in October.
Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) is a course of HIV drugs taken before sex to reduce the risk of contracting HIV.
Studies have shown that PEP significantly reduces the risk of HIV infection among at-risk people.
When taking PrEP before sex, the human body contains enough of certain drugs to prevent HIV infection.
These drugs can be taken daily or no later than two hours before sex.
Eligible patients include homosexual and bisexual men, transgender people, and people whose partners are HIV positive and do not receive successful treatment.
The researchers will select eligible participants for the study, including men, women, transgender people, and individuals whose partners are unknown about whether their HIV status is being held back by antiretroviral therapy.
People living and registered with a general practitioner in England will also be able to apply for potential participation in the nearest venereal disease clinic participating in the programme.
The programme will cost £10 million, and NHS England this week signed a contract to provide the drug following an international procurement tender.
The study is designed to assess the full potential of PEP by collecting clinical data on who is the drug's target audience, its uptake, and its use on a large scale.
"This critical innovation should complement and reinforce the large-scale and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV.
This is yet another milestone in more than three decades of progress in the fight against one of the biggest health threats facing humanity.
Deborah Gold, president of the NAT (National AIDS Control Authority), said: "This is a turning point in the fight against HIV.
PEP, if properly targeted at people who need help and are at risk, could make a difference to the state of the HIV epidemic in England.
Beginning in September, people at risk of HIV through this National Health Service-funded study in England will have access to a novel and empowering tool that people can control themselves without discussing it with a partner, improving many, many lives.
We warmly welcome this news. "
Ian Green, president of the Terrence Higgins Trust, said: "The priority now is to ensure that the trial is rolled out quickly across the country and that no one at risk of HIV is forgotten.
Now that we have the experimental drug PrEP, we are on track to protect more than 10,000 people at risk of HIV. "
Shadow health secretary Sharon Hodgson said: "We very much welcome the launch of the PEP trial, which has been badly delayed due to months of delay and delay by the government."
The data demonstrate how revolutionary this drug can be as part of our approach to preventing HIV and halting the transmission of this fatal infection.
This test will bring us one step closer to fully understanding the benefits of PEP.
It is now important that the trial be rolled out across the country as soon as possible to protect those at risk of HIV and move us one step closer to halting the spread of HIV in society.
The World Congress of the Tatars adopted a resolution to support the Tatarstan-Russia Treaty
The Sixth Congress of the World Congress of the Tatars (WCT) adopted a resolution in which it noted the importance of retaining the post of President in Tatarstan.
According to the document, the post is "a well-established form of organization of the highest state power in the Republic and expresses the national interests of the entire Tatar people."
In addition, the congress emphasized in the resolution the importance of the agreement on the delimitation of powers between Russia and Tatarstan.
According to the document, he "played a positive role in the ethno-cultural, socio-economic and socio-political development of Tatarstan and the Russian Federation as a whole."
Recall that the agreement between Moscow and Kazan, which has been in force since July 24, 2007, was concluded for 10 years.
On July 11, deputies of the State Council of Tatarstan appealed to the President of Russia with a request to extend the agreement and keep the title of the post of head of the region.
Currently, Tatarstan is the only subject of the federation that has an agreement with Russia.
The head of the region is the only one whose position is called "president."
In Russia, difficulties have arisen in obtaining an international driver's license
Traffic police units lack international driving licences (IDPs).
To obtain such rights, one has to wait in line for several weeks, which has become a real problem for vacationers who want to go on holiday abroad with their car or rent it there.
It should be noted that the situation with international driving licences remains contradictory.
The IDP was introduced to make it easier for foreign police to understand what is written on the national identity card, as the information is explained in five languages.
Requirements for international rights are enshrined in the 1968 Vienna Convention on Road Traffic, but in countries that have ratified the Vienna Convention, Russian rights are recognized in this way as well.
In reality, however, it all depends on individual police officers or rental companies: some require IDPs, and some require national rights.
To insure themselves, drivers do receive international rights, but it is worth bearing in mind that in countries that have not ratified the Convention (for example, the United States, Spain, Mexico, Indonesia), the authorities may not recognize either national rights or IDPs.
Now there is a problem with forms in almost all traffic police departments, Kommersant reports, having conducted research in a number of regions.
Thus, in Moscow, subdivisions of UGIBDD simply do not issue coupons, the forms have been missing for four months.
You can book an appointment on the website of public services, but there the queue has already stretched until mid-August.
In Krasnoyarsk, IDPs cannot be obtained "for technical reasons," without going into details; in Samara Oblast, it is honestly said that there are no forms, and a similar situation is developing in other cities.
Many Muscovites have already faced the problem, and the following messages are increasingly appearing on social media:
Irina Burmistrova: "Guess why you can't get international rights in Moscow?"
Correct, because all traffic police departments have run out of forms.
Elena Podkolzina: "A question to knowledgeable people!"
International rights are urgently needed.
In Moscow it is always far ahead, coupons are not issued at all on the spot (there is a button, but the coupon cannot be issued).
It seems that the portal of public services shows that in St. Petersburg time is free to fig.
Has anyone tried to get in another city?
Will it work?
As explained by the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Russian Federation, the requirements for forms of international driving licences have changed, so new forms are being delivered to subdivisions of the State Motor Vehicle Inspectorate.
This may be the reason for the deficit, although it is not clear what changes are in question, and it has not been previously reported.
The forms are purchased by the Center for Special Purpose in Road Traffic Safety (CSS RSD) of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Russian Federation and then delivered to traffic police departments.
In recent years, all contracts have been concluded with JSC Goznak: almost 200,000 IDP forms were produced in 2014-2015, 15,000 forms were purchased in 2016, and 90,000 in 2017, but the last contract was concluded on July 18 with OOO First Print Dvor for the production of 70,000 forms.
There is a theory that CSN simply did not manage to hold the tender on time, which resulted in the deficit.
However, there are other versions of the lack of forms: because of the crisis, many people began to travel independently not to Europe, but to cheaper Asian countries - China, Thailand, and so on.
It is not entirely clear what rights are accepted there, which is why people are reinsured, and why there has been a surge in demand for international "crusts."
It recently became known that professional drivers would have to take an examination to prove their qualifications.
Such a proposal was made by the Ministry of Transport.
The new International Driving Licence (IDP) will be valid from 31 May 2011.
Ukraine's Justice Minister Refuses to Believe in the Construction of the Crimean Bridge
Ukrainian Justice Minister Pavel Petrenko has said that he does not believe in Russia's ability to build a bridge to Crimea.
He said this in an interview with the Observer portal on Friday, 4 August.
No self-respecting international company will even put a bolt or a wrench in it, because it risks losing its business in the EU, the US, and Japan - countries that have joined the sanctions against Russia over Crimea.
"In other words, in my deep conviction, this project has virtually no prospects," declared Petrenco.
He added that he considers Russia incapable of implementing a major infrastructure project on its own.
Russia cannot normally build smaller-scale facilities.
I know that whole stadiums have already begun to crumble since the Sochi Olympics.
"Therefore, I believe that the best tool in this situation is sanctions against companies that have proved to be so short-sighted as to join this project," the official noted.
On July 31, the builders completed the construction of the arch of the automobile arch of the Crimean bridge.
On the Kerch coast, the road arch of the Crimean Bridge has been completed: its vault is closed at a height of 45 metres from the base of the structure.
"At the same time, bridge builders prepared a railway arch for installation on the fairway supports," the project's information centre reported.
In April, the head of the Ministry of Transport, Maxim Sokolov, informed Russian President Vladimir Putin that the construction of the facility was ahead of schedule.
The Crimean bridge will connect the Crimean peninsula and Krasnodar Krai.
In Spain, dismissed an official who did not go to work for 10 years
What angelic patience (or utter indifference to public service) should the Spanish official's boss, Carles Recio, have had?
Permanent truancy lasted for 10 long years.
Still, Mr. Recio was fired.
But not his immediate boss.
Which only in the world of bureaucrats does not happen.
Ordinaries, it seems, have long been accustomed to all the pranks of "servants of the people."
And yet officials always manage to surprise those on whose taxes they live well.
This time, the "sensation" came from Spain.
There, Carles Recio, a Valencia archivist, managed not to go to work for a decade.
At the same time, he received a regular salary.
And the whole substantial amount - 50 thousand euros per year.
And now, Mr. Recio's "wondrous times" are over.
He was dismissed by the Valencia Legislative Assembly.
The investigation revealed that a malicious truant would arrive at the office at 07: 00 every working morning to check in with the electronic system.
And then he went home.
He showed up at work again at 4 p.m. to note again on the system that he had left.
And so for 10 years.
It also became known that the truant devoted all his free time to drawing comics at home.
Now members of the Valencia Legislative Assembly are considering how to punish Mr. Recio's immediate supervisor, who could not help but know how to "actively work" in his workplace.
Judges offered protection from chairmen
The Presidential Council for Human Rights (HRC), on behalf of Vladimir Putin, has developed proposals to strengthen the independence of the judiciary.
The HRC proposes limiting the powers of court presidents and introducing their election.
For the courts of appeal and cassation, the HRC wants to introduce special districts that will not be tied to the administrative-territorial division in the Russian Federation.
The Supreme Court is also due to submit proposals within the framework of the presidential commission.
The HRC has finalized proposals that will strengthen the independence of the Russian judiciary.
This work was carried out by the HRC on behalf of Vladimir Putin on January 3, 2017, which the President gave after a meeting with the members of the Council.
At a meeting with the members of the Council on 8 December 2016, they discussed, among other things, individual cases of judicial arbitrariness, as well as problems of public control in places of detention of citizens (see Kommersant of 9 December).
The work of the HRC resulted in 25 proposals that address issues ranging from ensuring the independence of judges and identifying miscarriages of justice to court funding and legal education.
One idea put forward by Kremlin human rights activists is to limit the powers of court presidents in order to increase the independence of other judges.
If a candidate for the post of judge has successfully passed the competition and received the support of the judicial community, the president of the court, according to the HRC, should submit him for appointment, without having the right to refuse, as the law now allows.
It is also proposed to deprive the President of the right to assign cases to judges.
This, experts admit, can be done by a specially written computer program.
The HRC also considers that the chairman is not entitled to "predetermine the results of the qualification assessment of a judge, initiate disciplinary proceedings against him or her, or take decisions on the establishment of additional material payments."
At the same time, the Presidential Council considers it necessary to move to "the election of the presidents of the courts by the judges themselves" and to "endow them with powers of relatively short duration, with mandatory rotation."
Currently, all court presidents (from republican to district courts) are appointed for six years by the President on the proposal of the Chairman of the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation.
In order to protect judges from pressure from regional administrations, the HRC proposes a new organization of appeals and cassation in courts of general jurisdiction.
Now their structure is tied to the administrative-territorial division in the Russian Federation.
The HRC says that "it is necessary to ensure the organization of separate courts of appeal and cassation instances not at the level of regional judicial bodies in the constituent entities of the Russian Federation, but in judicial districts."
Experts rely on the practice of arbitration courts.
Under them, there are "judicial districts," which do not coincide with the administrative division in the Russian Federation, but thus guarantee greater independence from regional officials, who find it difficult to use the "telephone law."
The HRC proposes to strengthen the magistrates of the Human Rights Council with people's assessors in order to consider certain "categories of civil and administrative cases" with their participation.
For example, revocation of parental rights, reinstatement at work, protection of honour and dignity, revocation of driver's licenses, etc.
"These are only our proposals," Tamara Morshchakova, a member of the Human Rights Council and retired judge of the Constitutional Court, explained to Kommersant.
She also recalled that the President's instruction applied not only to the HRC, but also to the Supreme Court (SC), which has not yet disclosed its proposals.
There is still time for the Supreme Court (the co-executors include the Prosecutor General's Office and the Commissioner for Human Rights in the Russian Federation) to fulfill its mandate.
Chairman of the Supreme Court Vyacheslav Lebedev has until September 1 to report to Vladimir Putin on how effectively the independence of the judiciary is ensured in the Russian Federation.
Living the high life: The half-floor and clever design tricks have turned this small flat in Earl's Court into a spacious home
Joan Lee, a former banker with a passion for property renovations, moved from a spacious house in Knightsbridge to a flat in Earls Court in 2014.
The flat is on the ground floor of a pretty Queen Anne-style house, and in favour of the new design is the fact that Joan has not packed up her things and moved again.
"I used to live with my ex in Knightsbridge in a much bigger space," says Joan.
"I was looking for something comparable for my money.
I was shown this apartment in Earls Court and it had the same high ceilings.
I fell in love with her and offered a price the same day. "
Since first viewing, the 1,000-square-foot apartment has undergone a complete renovation.
Originally, it was a one-bedroom flat - you had to walk through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - and Joanna wanted to add storage space and a half-floor to make the most of the generous height of the ceilings.
"I wanted high ceilings, big windows, lots of light.
Those were my demands, "she says.
To that end, she hired Erfan Azadi from the Notting Hill-based architectural and design studio Duck & Shed to use 12.5-foot-high ceilings to create a home that would not only be a successful project, but also fit for Joan to live in.
The ceiling was not high enough to accommodate two rooms one above the other, so the architectural challenge was to create a semi-floor where one could stand at full height.
Erfan had to think creatively to cope with the brief.
"Working with steel structures is very difficult," he explains.
"We had to arrange the rooms so that they were above each other and did not have to bend.
It was not just a matter of building a simple platform, but also of bending the structures so that they were at the right height and allowed the space to be used from above and below. "
This decision allowed Erfan to arrange two full-size rooms, one above the other, in the allocated space - and much more.
From the half-floor, a vintage copper light window from "Retrouvius" overlooks the chic living room below.
Mirrored furniture with gold trim, silver accents and vintage lighting from Serge Mooy set the style of the project.
The use of mirrors plays a role in adding spectacle, space and light.
The short corridor is framed by mirrors to make it seem longer.
In the kitchen, the mirror safety panel looks like a window into another room.
At the entrance, mirrored cabinets are used to store all Joan's crockery.
To create the feel of a more luxurious space, the beauty of the living room can block out the kitchen when it is not used.
Folding kitchens are nothing new.
The uniqueness of this kitchen is that it is a sliding door, like in a garage.
"Engineering was involved here," Erfan says of the steel-reinforced wood-fiber panel door.
"It has a counterweight, so when you push the door up, it slips very easily."
Thanks to the judicious use of space and storage, Joan was given an additional 16 square metres, an additional bedroom and an improved layout.
"At the end of the day, floor space is what you will sell, that is, what your property is valued at," says Erfan.
"To put it bluntly, an estate agent will come in and make a calculation based on floor space."
Here, they were able to increase the floor area using quality materials that add a touch of luxury to the space.
"Materials are what we touch, so they help create an emotional connection to the home," says Erfan.
"Nobody falls in love with the wiring in the walls.
It is important, but it does not touch the strings of our hearts. "
This is a testament to the fact that the apartment can go from something ordinary to something stunning due to its good design and increased footprint.
In fact, like Joan, you may decide to stay.
The Government has approved the establishment of a Commission on Cultural Policy
The Russian government has approved the creation of a commission on state cultural policy.
The relevant decree is published on the government's website.
According to the document, the main task of the commission will be to develop and adjust strategic approaches to the implementation of cultural policy.
The Commission will also develop draft strategies for cultural policy, clarify tasks and prepare new programs for its implementation.
Deputy Prime Minister of the Russian Federation has been appointed head of the Commission.
The composition of the Commission will be approved separately.
In 2016, the Prime Minister of the Russian Federation, Dmitry Medvedev, approved a plan to implement the strategy of state cultural policy until 2030.
The plan includes 193 measures and provides for measures to expand the influence of Russian culture in other countries, preserve the common cultural space and cultural heritage, and will contribute to the creation of conditions for the development of culture in the country.
G20 inflation falls to eight-year low
Consumer price growth in the G20 countries has fallen to an eight-year low, The Wall Street Journal reports, citing data from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD).
The OECD estimates that inflation was 2% in June 2016, down from 1.7% in October 2009.
Earlier, Rosstat reported a 0.1% decline in Russia's consumer price index.
Thus, the agency recorded the first weekly deflation in 2017.
The inflation target in Russia, according to the Ministry of Finance's calculations, is 4.1%.
However, the Ministry of Economy believes that the target has already been achieved - according to the Ministry, the figure is 4%.
Putin warned against illegal felling of the Baikal taiga
Russian leader Vladimir Putin warned against the illegal destruction of forests during a meeting on the environmental development of the natural Baikal territory.
During the event, the Minister of Natural Resources, Sergei Donskoy, noted that a bill had been prepared earlier.
It permits deforestation during fire suppression, and the government plans to enact it in the fall.
In turn, the President said that the project should be monitored to ensure that "everything is not cut down in a row" during the cutting process.
Donskoy noted that this bill presupposes control by the Ministry of Emergency Situations and supervisory agencies.
Mass media: Armed Forces of Ukraine fighters secretly negotiate with Donbas militias from the command
Regular telephone communication has been established on the line of armed confrontation in Donbas.
Fighters of the opposing sides constantly communicate with each other on mobile phones, and this communication is not known in the headquarters.
Fighters of the Armed Forces of Ukraine and Donbas militia have established communication over cellular phones in secret from their high command.
This was reported by Strana.ua on 4 August, with reference to the participants in the military operation in Donbas.
According to the publication, unit commanders are well aware of the names of their colleagues on the opposite side of the front and communicate with them by telephone on a daily basis.
Communication is far from mundane: commanders try to reach some "tactical agreements."
Part of the result of such talks is a truce on a particular front.
Journalists became aware of cases when a certain officer received birthday greetings from behind the front line, from his formal enemy.
Armed Forces of Ukraine and the Donetsk and Luhansk People's Republic militia have been sitting in trenches on the boundary line since the spring of 2014, when Ukraine launched a combat operation against Donbas.
The MFA was outraged by the blocking of statements by the UN Security Council on the attacks on the Russian Embassy
The Russian Foreign Ministry is outraged by the actions of individual Western diplomatic representatives who block statements by the UN Security Council in the press condemning the terrorist shelling of the Russian Embassy in Syria.
This is reported by the Russian Foreign Ministry.
The agency recalled that the territory of the Russian Embassy in Damascus was subjected to mortar fire for the third time in a month by terrorists of the Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (formerly Jabhat al-Nusra, banned in the Russian Federation) and Faylaq al-Rahman groups.
Taking into account that the international community is unanimous in classifying Nusra as a terrorist organization, and the UN Security Council resolutions call for counteracting this structure, the Russian Foreign Ministry noted that "it seems self-evident that Nusra's terrorist attacks should be met with universal unconditional and resolute condemnation, and there should be no ambiguity in the assessments of attacks against diplomatic missions."
However, as the diplomatic agency emphasized, "for the third time in a month, the diplomatic representatives of the United States, the United Kingdom, France and Ukraine in the UN Security Council, alternately varying the tone of their objections, hiding behind arguments about the alleged lack of necessary information, blocked the Russian Federation's proposal to adopt a standard short draft Security Council press statement condemning the terrorist attacks on the Russian diplomatic mission in the Syrian capital."
The unwillingness to show diplomatic solidarity with us should be on the conscience of these delegations.
"What is most outrageous is that the failure of the Security Council to condemn the acts of terrorists encourages them to carry out further provocations and terrorist attacks and gives them a sense of impunity," the Foreign Ministry said, adding that "we do not want these barbarians to be convinced that anyone in the Security Council is with them."
Vladimir Putin spoke out in favor of limiting the number of unscheduled business inspections
During a meeting on investment projects in the Far East, Russian President Vladimir Putin stated that the number of unscheduled inspections of entrepreneurs should be reduced to 30% of the number of scheduled inspections, and also spoke of the need to limit the duration of inspections to ten days.
"Unscheduled inspections are carried out, as a rule, without appropriate coordination with the prosecutor's office; only 2-3% is coordinated with the prosecutor's office, the rest goes on its own," TASS quotes the president as saying.
Vladimir Putin also said that investigators should be prohibited from seizing servers and hard drives at enterprises.
In addition, according to the president, business associations should have the right to defend the interests of their members in court.
"I hope that this will make a positive contribution to the consideration of cases related to entrepreneurial activity or violations of the law in the field of entrepreneurship," the head of state said.
As Kommersant reported, due to the moratorium on routine inspections, the number of other types of inspections of entrepreneurs is growing.
In May, a survey commissioned by the Business Ombudsman under the President of Russia, Boris Titov, revealed that routine inspections had actually been replaced by unscheduled inspections (the share of those confronted with them rose from 21.9% in 2015 to 30.8% in 2016), prosecutor's inspections (from 16.9% to 21.8%), raid inspections (from 7.9% to 13.3%), as well as inspections on citizens "applications (from 15% to 19.5%) and administrative investigations (from 10.8% to 15.5%).
More about business inspections in Kommersant's material "Small business came from the other side."
The brothers are competing for a real estate empire worth more than $500 million
Two brothers are fighting for one of Victoria's largest real estate empires worth more than $500 million - 40 years after their Italian ancestors founded a dynasty.
Former Carlton Football Club director and property developer Colin de Lutis lives in Toorak Palace three doors away from his younger brother Paul, who is suing him in the Supreme Court for the division of possessions and assets.
Paul has wanted to leave the family business since 2014, but a bitter divorce battle is still raging in the Supreme Court.
Together with their mother Anna, the brothers own 87 properties worth more than half a billion dollars since the family bought the Smith Street store in Collingwood in 1973.
There, the family founded Westco Jeans, which grew into a chain of 160 outlets.
It was sold in 1999 for $85 million.
The money has been invested in real estate, and the De Lutis family's list of holdings now includes office buildings, development sites in Brunswick and Sorrento, apartments on the Gold Coast and Mount Buller, and shopping malls in the suburbs.
By arrangement with his late father, Colin - whom Paul describes as the De Lutis family's "main driving force and dominant personality" - owns about two-thirds of the company's assets, while Paul owns about one-third.
According to court records, this means Colin's estate is worth $316 million, while Paul's is worth $176 million.
The division of property and money was a stumbling block for Paul.
"The section proposed by Colin gives him, in my view, the best parts of the property," he wrote in his first testimony in 2015.
Last Friday, after several failed attempts at reconciliation, the Supreme Court held its first hearing.
The brothers are now at loggerheads over who will control the existing business - from which Paul believes Colin has excluded him.
Colin claims this is not the case, but accuses Paul of mismanaging some of the properties.
In testimony given by Colin at the start of the trial, he said he hoped the dispute would be resolved.
"My Italian roots make me consider family a top priority," he wrote.
Legal costs are mounting like a snowball: hundreds of pages of testimony, emails, and reports from companies such as Deloitte, Pitcher Partners, and Charter Keck Cramer have been attached to the case; both parties have hired top lawyers, including Allan Myers QC, and top solicitors.
Mrs. De Lutis and her late husband, Luigi, were immigrants from Italy; since the late 1950 "s, they have run dairy bars and gastronomy, and in the early 1970" s bought a store in Brunswick.
With financial guarantees, they bought a shop in Collingwood, where Colin opened the first family jeans shop.
Colin says he started Westco when he was "in the last year of school and Paul was a boy then (about 10 years old)."
Anna De Lutis says she and Luigi, who died in 2012, had hoped to pass their estate on to their sons without conflict.
"Luigi has often told me that he does not want the brothers to go to court," she wrote.
Two other brothers, Mark and Luke, are no longer part of the De Lutis group; Colina says Mark got $10 million when he left the business and Luke $26 million.
According to Paul, both Luke and Mark were "unhappy with the financial terms of their separation."
Colin was not a public figure, although he was a former member of the AFL club's board of directors and, according to a 2015 biography by Eddie McGuire, the TV star's best friend.
Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul and their lawyers on Friday.
The only response was from Colin, a text message that said that, as the case had not yet come to court, "I have nothing to say."
"I am very, very sorry that my brother Paul has decided to sue me and take the name of our family to court," he wrote.
In mid-2016, Colin wrote in a deposition that he was trying to satisfy his brother's demands.
"Our father would not like to see Paul and I argue in court," he said, adding that he "still hopes for a resolution."
On Friday, that hope seemed to have dissipated.
"Our case will be decided by the court soon," Colin wrote.
Trump's new chief of staff plans to limit the flow of information to the president.
Others tried and failed.
Maybe John F. Kelly will actually succeed.
In that case, he would be the first.
Politico reports that the new White House chief of staff plans to limit the flow of information to President Trump, including news reports from the media - hoping to keep the chief at bay.
That's what reporter Josh Dawsey reports.
"In a meeting that the new White House chief of staff, John F. Kelly, held with senior staff on his first day in office, he identified a major problem in President Donald Trump's White House that he hopes to address: poor channels of communication to the president."
Kelly told staff that information should pass through him - in paper form or through briefings - because the president would be better off making decisions if he got the right information.
Kelly's diagnosis is entirely correct, but others have already failed in trying to pacify Trump by tracking his communications.
President Trump's relationship with television dates back decades - and now that he is in the White House, his habit of watching TV is still strong.
"When Trump, as a candidate, resented unfair coverage of the campaign, it was helpful to show him that he was getting fair coverage in outlets that could be persuaded," Sam Nunberg, a former campaign adviser, told Politico in February.
Tara Palmeri wrote in Politico at the time that "according to six former campaign staff members, in order to keep Trump's Twitter habit under control, one had to ensure that there was a constant stream of praise for him personally."
Good.
But the idea that Trump's Twitter habit has ever been "under control" is simply laughable.
Maybe these campaign staff members know something we don't - that, were it not for them, Trump's tweets would have been even more provocative.
We may never know about the tweets that Trump did not post.
If his staff kept him out of trouble even a few times, their efforts were not in vain.
But no one has always been able to keep Trump from adding fuel to the fire.
Part of the problem is that in a White House divided into rival factions, people are constantly trying to advance their agenda by giving Trump material - trustworthy or not - that confirms their views.
Politico - just for this story - wrote in May about advisers "penchant for peddling dubious information to the president.
Here is one example, described by reporter Shane Goldmacher:
"Current and former Trump associates say that Trump can react very harshly to negative press reports, especially those containing dangerous leaks, and will not rest until he finds out who was behind them.
That happened in late February, when someone leaked to the president a printout of an article from GotNews.com, the website of the Internet provocateur Charles C. Johnson, accusing deputy chief of staff Katie Welsh of being "behind a series of leaks" at the White House.
Never mind that Johnson is forever banned from Twitter for aggressive behavior, that he has not provided specific facts, or that he has made false accusations in the past and then retracted them.
Trump read the article and began asking staff about Welsh. "
Goldmacher adds that then-Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and Secretary of Staff Rob Porter "tried to build a system to manage and document the flow of documents that Trump receives."
How did it work?
Three months later, Kelly is trying to do the same.
He may prove to be a more effective manager than Priebus, but Trump still has an impulsive nature, and his aides are still fighting each other for influence.
These constant factors make Kelly's task very difficult.
Tyumen Prosecutor's Office Struggles with HIV Dissident
The prosecutor's office challenged the ruling of the Kalinin District Court of Tyumen, which dismissed a criminal case against a local resident whose infant daughter died of HIV.
According to investigators, the child died because the mother is an HIV dissident and refused treatment.
However, the court exonerated her in connection with reconciliation with the injured father.
The prosecutor's office believes that the crime cannot go unpunished, so as not to set a precedent for other HIV dissidents.
The case against a resident of Tyumen was brought under Article 109 (1) of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation (causing death by negligence) in April - after her three-year-old daughter died of stage 4B HIV infection.
According to prosecutors, the mother herself is HIV positive.
"The woman did not treat herself and refused to treat her daughter, believing that the HIV infection did not exist," the Tyumen Region Prosecutor's Office explained.
The criminal case went to the Kalinin District Court of Tyumen, which on 25 July decided to terminate it.
The petition was filed by the father of the dead girl, explaining that "he forgave his wife, he has no claims to her, she made amends for the damage and apologized."
The prosecutor's office disagreed with the court's decision and appealed, demanding that the dismissal order be revoked and sent back for a new trial.
The girl is dead, and it is impossible to make amends for the harm caused by the crime.
The HIV-infected mother refused to examine the baby and treat her for a dangerous infection, contrary to doctors "recommendations," the press service of the prosecutor's office reported.
According to the watchdog, she must be punished or other dissidents will follow suit.
According to the Tyumen AIDS Center, currently in Tyumen Oblast, about 12 children with HIV do not receive medical care because of parental refusal.
"And this situation has already improved - during the year of work of the special group, half of the parents who categorically refused to treat their children for HIV changed their minds - allowed for diagnosis, and began to take drugs," said Elena Loseva, a spokeswoman for the AIDS Center.
According to her, there is no legal way to influence parents, and as a result, not all HIV-infected children can be detected - mothers do not allow them to be examined, hide, run away with their children from hospitals.
How HIV Dissidents Are Dangerous
Late last year, St. Petersburg sociologists presented the results of Russia's first study of the so-called HIV-dissident movement.
HIV dissidents are defined as people who deny the existence of HIV and refuse to take medication.
Medics and activists of AIDS service NGOs call such views anti-medical, and see their spread as a serious threat.
An eerie photo shoot that ended in tragedy took place on Thursday, August 3, at the Grecany railway station in Khmelnitsky.
A cheerful group of drunk young men strolled across the bridge over the tracks where the freight train was parked.
One of the friends had the idea to take a spectacular selfie on the roof of the carriage, Fakty was informed in the sector of police communications in Khmelnitsky region.
The boy began to climb down from the bridge to the train, but due to his carelessness he got caught on a power line and was hit by an instant electric shock.
Fortunately, the incident came to the attention of the station's dispatcher, who immediately called an "emergency."
Before the arrival of doctors, the victim was moved to a safe place, and then hospitalized in the burn department of the Khmelnytsky Regional Clinical Hospital.
The man was diagnosed with first- to second-degree torso burns.
Doctors are now assessing his condition as stable.
Law enforcement officials remind that lately, extreme selfies on the roofs of high-rise buildings, bridges, and moving vehicles have become increasingly popular.
Police are urging people to be vigilant and to avoid such photo shoots, especially among children and teenagers.
Scientists have allowed oceans to exist on ancient Venus
The oceans may have existed on ancient Venus.
This was the assumption made by French scientists.
Experts created a computer model that demonstrated the formation of water on the surface of the planets, writes Science News.
It turned out that at the beginning of its history, Venus formed oceans that had 10% more water than Earth does today.
Earlier, Arguments of the Week wrote that scientists hypothesized that an ocean 4 billion years ago could have existed on Mars.
Foreign experts, in the course of their research, came to the conclusion that the water object was located in the northern hemisphere of the Red Planet.
Three people injured in San Francisco park shooting
Three people were injured in the shooting in San Francisco, the Associated Press reports.
The incident took place in Dolores Park when a large number of visitors were there.
According to witnesses, several men on the bridge began shouting threats.
One of them pulled out a weapon and started shooting at people.
The appearance of the intruders could not be considered, as they had everything but their eyes closed.
Another was treated and released.
The third injured is a minor, there are no details about his condition.
Located on the hill Dolores Park is a popular place among locals and tourists.
On July 1, at least 17 people were injured in a shooting at a nightclub in Little Rock, Arkansas.
Several other visitors were injured while trying to leave the premises.
rock band Louna will present a new album in Barnaul
The concert of rock band Louna will take place in Barnaul on October 17.
Musicians will present their new album Brave New World, which has become one of the most anticipated releases of the year.
The band is preparing a concept show that will be the brightest in the band's concert history.
Brave New World is the fourth album by the Russian rock band Louna.
Its name is associated with the famous dystopian novel by O. Huxley "On a Brave New World."
The new songs do not retell the book, but tell about a society that lives by the law of dystopia, "blindly believing in propaganda and imposed values."
More than 1,200 people supported the project on the Planeta.ru website.
Louna released her first album, "Make It louder!," in 2010.
Two years later, the musicians released "Time X," and in 2013 recorded the album "We are Louna" (2013).
In autumn 2015, Louna performed with the Symphony Orchestra at Crocus City Hall with the Songs of Peace programme.
The band consists of Lusine Gevorgyan (vocals), Vitaly Demidenko (bass), Ruben Kazaryan (guitar), Sergei Ponkratiev (guitar), Leonid Kinzbursky (drums).
The concert will take place in Barnaul club "Pharaon" on October 17 at 19.00.
Ticket price: from 1200 to 2600 roubles.
Louna is one of the most popular bands on the Russian rock scene.
The team was founded in 2008.
Their debut concert took place in 2009.
The band won several times in different categories of the hit parade "Devil's Dozen."
The Roma have overcome the moat and returned to the "street of millionaires"
Some of the West Midlands "wealthiest homeowners are once again at loggerheads with determined gypsies who have overcome a council-dug ditch to reoccupy a field next to their homes.
The Roma parked 20 houses on wheels in a field bordering wealthy Solihull Street, jokingly dubbed "Millionaire's Street."
Bringing horses, babies, and many houses on wheels, they returned after being kicked out as recently as May, and were not deterred by a ditch dug by the municipal authorities to prevent their incursions.
This tactful company found a gap in the defensive structures and squeezed its vehicles through an area that was left unfenced to make way for a footpath.
Angry residents attacked Solihull council, saying it was "failing to tackle the problem."
An anonymous local resident said: 'They came here on Monday evening after being driven out of a Bentley Heath where they were throwing stones at passers-by.'
The municipality should be shamed and forced to act, because they are utterly incapable of solving the problem.
The Roma were here in May, they were expelled, and now they are back.
Last night, even more Roma arrived; today, perhaps even more.
"Birmingham City Council knows how to solve this problem, they get long-term court orders to protect their parks," she added.
I live on Streetsbrook Road and I don't like the fact that I continue to pay council tax and the council can't even put a stop to it. "
One local resident, who wished to remain anonymous, said: "It's funny, we just saw these gypsies leave the previous time, so please, this attack goes on."
This time, there were more of them, and we even saw a horse grazing in the meadow. "
A Solihull City Council spokesman said: "We are aware of an illegal encampment on land near Streetsbrook Road and are working with Solihull Police; we are taking the necessary legal action to remove them as soon as possible."
To help us gather evidence, it is important that as many local residents as possible report any anti-social or criminal behaviour to the police on 101.
This gives us an idea of the situation that the court will consider when we present our case to them.
Crimea shares the "New World" champagne wine factory
State Unitary Enterprise of the Republic of Crimea "Novy Svet" Champagne Wines Plant "has been decided to become joint-stock company, having transformed into JSC" Novy Svet Champagne Wines Plant, "follows from the order of the Minister of Property and Land Relations of Crimea, Anna Anyukhina.
100% of the company's shares will remain in state ownership of Crimea.
The authorized capital of the joint stock company will amount to 595.5 million roubles and will consist of 5.955 million ordinary shares with a nominal value of 100 roubles each.
The Ministry of Agriculture of Crimea stated that if funds were not found to modernize the plant within the next three years, the threat of the plant's shutdown would arise.
Depreciation of fixed assets at the enterprise amounts to about 60-70%.
The modernization of the enterprise requires 1.2 billion roubles. Due to the peculiarities of the organizational and legal form, it is obliged to give 50% of the profit to the budget.
What remains is not enough to implement the modernization plan.
"It is difficult to get money from the owner, it is difficult to talk about borrowing from large credit institutions," Sergei Petelin, Deputy Minister of Agriculture of Crimea, said in April this year.
The Parliament of Crimea included the enterprise in the forecast privatization plan for 2017
It was proposed that it be corporatized and put up for auction.
Interfax's source in the Crimean authorities estimated the possible cost of selling the enterprise at $40 million, and the investor's investment in modernization at another $30 million.
In 2016, New World increased the production of sparkling wines by 2.8% compared to 2015 - up to 1.52 million bottles.
In 2017, New World was aiming to release 1.6 million bottles.
The enterprise was founded in 1878 by Prince Lev Golitsyn as a sparkling wine production plant in the New World estate he purchased.
The plant is located on 11 hectares of land.
Nizhny Novgorod third-graders destroyed more than 40 tombstones
Employees of the Department of the Ministry of the Interior of Nizhny Novgorod Region identified the citizens who destroyed 46 gravestones in the cemetery of the city of Lyskovo.
The perpetrators were third-grade students.
The first statement that the tombstones were damaged by unknown individuals reached the OMVD of Russia in Lyskovsky District as early as June 27.
A total of 24 people appealed to the police in this regard.
As a result, criminal proceedings were initiated under Article 244 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation "Destruction, damage or desecration of burial sites."
As a result of the investigation, police identified the suspects, they turned out to be two schoolchildren aged 8 and 9 years.
Juvenile offenders told the police that they were interested in seeing the monuments fall, which prompted them to act in a disorderly manner.
Preventive measures have been taken with children and their parents.
Italy is taking a tougher tone towards NGO ships rescuing migrants.
Italy has warned NGOs that own rescue vessels in the Mediterranean that they will not be able to continue their work unless they comply with the new rules governing their activities.
"If the NGOs do not comply with the new code of conduct, it is difficult to say whether they will be able to continue their activities," Interior Minister Mario Minniti said in an interview with the Turin daily newspaper Stampa.
Minniti's warning came a day after Italian authorities seized a ship belonging to the German humanitarian organization Jugend Rettet on suspicion that its crew was actually collaborating with human traffickers and facilitating illegal immigration.
The humanitarian organisation, which has been operating for just a year, declined to comment on the substance of the detailed charges brought against it by Italian prosecutor Ambrogio Cartosio.
"For us, saving human lives is and will remain our top priority, so we very much regret that we cannot continue our activities in the search and rescue zone at this time," the organization said in a statement on social media.
"We will be able to assess all the charges now only after we have gathered all the information and been able to assess the situation."
Italian authorities have been monitoring the vessel, the Jugend Rettet, since October.
Its crew is suspected of taking migrants aboard in whole lifeboats, which traffickers sent directly to them, and allowing smugglers to leave with boats they could use again.
At least one such meeting is believed to have taken place just 1.3 miles off the Libyan coast, according to the indictment, the contents of which were published in Italian media.
The crew is suspected of violating the regulations of the Italian coast authorities, who control rescue operations in the area, more out of humanitarian zeal than for any other reason.
The code of conduct mainly assumes that ships of the Juventus type will have an Italian police officer on board to monitor their activities.
So far, only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations have agreed to abide by the code: Save the Children, Malta's MOAS, and Pro-Activa Open Embraces from Spain.
The latter said on Thursday that it considered the new rules unnecessary but acceptable as long as they did not entail any "meaningful change or impediment" to its rescue operations.
Among those who refused to sign are Nobel Prize-winning Doctors Without Borders (MSF).
Meanwhile, Minniti said the sharp decline in recent weeks in the number of migrants arriving in Italy as a result of rescue operations indicates that efforts to support the Libyan coast guard and cooperate with local mayors are bearing fruit.
"In recent days, we have started to see light at the end of the tunnel," the minister said.
He announced plans for further talks with Libyan mayors on economic development initiatives, and with Chad, Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants leaving those countries in the hope of reaching Europe.
"In Libya, we do not want to be associated with any of the parties to the conflict"
The authorities of the Russian Federation have recently significantly stepped up their policy in the Libyan direction, and with their visits to Moscow, delegations from the opposing Libyan parties have become more frequent.
Lev Dengov, Head of the Russian contact group on the inter-Libyan settlement under the Russian Foreign Ministry and the State Duma, Assistant to the Head of the Chechen Republic, told Kommersant what goals Moscow is pursuing in this region and on whom it is betting.
Little is known about the contact group on Libya that you chair.
Here is, say, a contact group on Ukraine - everyone knows about it.
And here is the veil of mystery.
What exactly are you doing, what are your goals?
The Contact Group was established on the initiative of the Russian Foreign Ministry and the State Duma.
Its activities are overseen by Deputy Foreign Minister Mikhail Bogdanov and Adam Delimkhanov (a member of the Duma from Chechnya - Kommersant).
The latter is authorized to work in the Libyan direction by State Duma Speaker Vyacheslav Volodin.
The impetus for the creation of the group was the detention in Libya of the Russian tanker Mekhanik Chebotarev (in September 2015, there were 11 people on board. - Kommersant).
We thought about how to help the crew.
At that time, a contact group of military specialists and representatives of the State Duma was created, and our work was supported by the head of Chechnya, Ramzan Kadyrov.
And how did it happen that you led it?
As I have been working on Libya since 2008, I have been asked to lead the team.
Our activities were not limited to the release of the sailors from Mekhanik Chebotarev.
We were able to establish contacts with representatives of all the main factions opposing each other in the Libyan conflict - both from Tripoli (where the UN-recognized government headed by Faiz Saraj is based - Kommersant) and Tobruk (the seat of parliament, which opposes the government and supports Marshal Khalifa Haftar, who controls eastern Libya - Kommersant).
Thanks to the active participation of Ahmed Metig (Deputy Prime Minister of Libya - Kommersant), we were able to quickly negotiate the release of the Russian sailors.
It was then decided to establish a contact group to make better use of these contacts.
Its task is to analyze the situation, identify key factors and players, and engage in dialogue with all parties to the conflict.
I would like to emphasize that in Libya we do not want to be associated with any of the parties to the conflict, we are in dialogue with everyone.
How many people are in the contact group, and how many of them are permanently in Libya?
There are now five members of the contact group.
Among them are people with experience in law enforcement agencies, including the Ministry of Defense.
We also want to include representatives of the Middle East Institute of the Russian Academy of Sciences in the group of experts on the region.
None of our staff is permanently in Libya, and there is no need to do so at this time.
Are there Russian military advisers and instructors in Libya right now?
And if so, on whose side?
There are no Russian military specialists in Libya.
All the talk and publications about this are untrue.
But your contact group includes ex-military personnel...
Yes, and their presence is necessary.
For example, when we visit hot spots.
Or cities, such as Misrata (where the militias that played a role in the overthrow of Libyan leader Muammar el-Qaddafi in 2011 and intensified markedly in subsequent years are based), that are closed to us until a certain point.
We arrived in Misrata in January of this year.
We were intimidated, we were told that all the Islamists and terrorists were there.
But it was important for us to assess the situation there for ourselves, to analyze the real military potential, who is responsible for what, why such rumors are circulating, what the real role of the Islamists is there.
In Misrata, we met with all the representatives of the units that were engaged in the destruction of IS in Sirte (in December 2016, this city on the Mediterranean coast was recaptured from the militants of the banned in Russia "Islamic State" - Kommersant).
We wanted to look at them, to get to know these people, to check the information that they were the ones who played a decisive role in the destruction of IS in Libya, not Khalifa Haftar, who attributed these achievements to himself.
And what conclusion have you reached?
Is it not Haftar who defeated the Islamic State in Libya?
It was not his job to do that.
Haftar conducted operations on another front, in Benghazi.
And IS in Sirte has been fought by structures subordinate to the government in Tripoli.
And, by the way, we invited to Russia the people who carried out this anti-terrorist operation.
And they arrived - the visit lasted from 19 to 23 April of this year, the Libyan delegation was received in the Federation Council, the Duma, the Foreign Ministry and Rosguard.
You are, as we have learned, in all the Libyan regions, and you are probably aware of the sentiments of local elites and warlords.
Do you think it will be possible to implement the cease-fire agreements on the holding of elections that Khalifa Haftar and Faiz Saraj reached in Paris at the end of July?
Or again, as has happened so many times in the past, will agreements be broken, hostilities resume, and the parties try to seize power alone?
It is a good sign for us that Saraj and Haftar have agreed to another meeting, which was not so long ago impossible.
In the recent past, both leaders have been extremely negative about each other.
As for Russia's position...
It is often written and said that Moscow actively supports Haftar, and many believe it.
We faced this situation when we were in Misrata, and it was on that very day that Haftar boarded the Russian aircraft carrier Admiral Kuznetsov.
It was a coincidence.
But Misrata did not believe the coincidence.
We were told: "You are probably very brave people who came to us today."
But our task is precisely to show that we do not support Haftar alone; we are engaged in dialogue with all the key actors in the conflict in Libya.
You and Haftar communicated.
Does the fact that he studied twice in the USSR facilitate mutual understanding with his Russian partners on a human, emotional level?
And, by the way, does Haftar know the Russian language?
If he knows Russian, he knows it relatively well.
But what he has learned from us certainly facilitates dialogue with him.
And not just with him, by the way.
When we talk to the military in Tripoli and Misrata, we meet generals who studied either in Russia or in the Soviet Union.
And now they speak Russian very well.
And they are drawn to Russia, to some extent nostalgic for it.
Do you think that the arms embargo imposed on Libya is likely to be lifted soon?
Are your Libyan interlocutors interested in supplying Russian weapons?
Interested, of course, but, as I said, we do not take sides in this conflict and would not like to arm some at the expense of others.
We would like to see everyone in roughly equal positions.
As for the arms embargo, there are constant calls from Libyans for Russia to contribute somehow to its lifting.
Libya's constitution-making process is now well under way.
We hope that the parties will reach compromise solutions and reach an internal consensus.
Elections should follow, as Saraj and Haftar discussed at their meeting.
If elections are held and a legitimate government is finally elected (and neither side currently has this status), the question of lifting the arms embargo could be raised in the UN Security Council.
Raising the issue now is pointless and dangerous, and will only escalate the conflict.
The other day, the media reported that Italy, faced with the problem of African refugees coming from Libya, feels abandoned by its EU allies.
Can Moscow help its Italian partners in this situation by using its links with the Libyans?
Is it realistic, for example, for Haftar's forces to take control of the coast and put an end to the business of smugglers transporting immigrants to Europe?
A very timely question.
We are actively working on this.
The Italians need Russia's support, because Moscow is simultaneously engaged in dialogue with Haftar, Saraj, Misrata, and the south of the country.
Tribes in southern Libya play a major role here, and they are ready to cooperate with Russia.
Is it about the southerners stopping the flow of migrants on the far side?
So, conventionally speaking, have the buses carrying Nigerian migrants been turned back?
That is what we are trying to achieve.
But it's not easy.
Some clans and groups have an interest in keeping these flows going.
We hope to help bring southerners together in the negotiation process between Saraj, Haftar and the tribes in the south.
But, for starters, we would like to see Haftar and Saraj agree on this issue.
The head of the government in Tripoli, Faiz Saraj, is considered an Islamist who advocates the introduction of Sharia law in the country.
How radical is he?
Wouldn't that be an obstacle to building relations with Russia or the West?
I will give my personal opinion about him.
In my view, he is, on the contrary, an opponent of radical Islam.
But Islamists are in his coalition.
Yes, but he holds the position that Libya should be a perfectly normal country - moderately Islamic, open to the world.
And he is also active in the fight against terrorists.
Why does he have such a reputation?
It was created by countries that have no interest in Russia communicating with Tripoli.
Tripoli is, after all, the capital, home to the legislature, the executive, and the judiciary.
There is a national oil corporation, a national bank, and other state structures.
Of course, some countries had an interest in keeping us out.
And we mixed all the cards with them and started actively communicating with Tripoli and Tobruk.
And we are already reaping the benefits: Rosneft has signed a cooperation agreement with Libya's state oil company, NOC.
NOC director Mustafa Sanalla, with whom Rosneft chief Igor Sechin struck the deal, is himself from Tripoli.
And two weeks ago, the first shipment of Libyan oil to Rosneft took place.
What will Russia do about it?
I think it's a resale.
And what other economic interests does Russia have in Libya?
Plans are afoot to re-sign contracts signed under Muammar el-Qaddafi.
This refers, in particular, to previous agreements in the field of transport (the construction of railways), energy (electrification), and a number of others.
And the Libyans have something to pay for?
Well, they have oil.
So, just as in the case of Iran, is it an oil-for-services scheme?
I don't know what the scheme will be, I don't deal with these issues directly.
In fact, the economy is not the main issue for Russia in Libya.
We are, in fact, engaged in peacemaking there.
For us, the most important thing is to stop the bloodshed, to help Libyans come to terms with each other so that they can establish order and Libya is no longer a breeding ground for terrorism.
For Russia, this is its main task - to help the Libyan people and push out the terrorists.
Do you have any information about the presence in Libya (now or before) of radical militants from Russia or other countries of the former USSR?
One of the tasks of our contact group was to find out.
I met with a representative of the Libyan State Security Committee, who said that, to date, not a single person from Russia and other countries of the former USSR is there.
He said that he had about 50,000 phone records of representatives of Islamist and radical groups (in Libya. - Kommersant), and there was no Russian speech there.
And from which states, then, do these militants come?
I don't want to go into those details.
Then we will formulate the question differently.
How many Libyans are among the Islamist fighters in Libya?
Libyans are almost non-existent, accounting for no more than 5%.
The rest are newcomers.
Can Moscow hold intra-Libyan talks along the lines of Paris?
There are such plans.
We are actively negotiating with the Libyans, several delegations from Libya have already visited Moscow, and have declared their readiness to come to Moscow or Grozny.
And when can such talks take place?
It's hard to say right now.
Several visits are still to take place, and then, I hope, there will be clarity about the time and place of the talks.
In Chekhov Museum, benefactors raised money for an expensive gift to a sick boy
Nine-year-old boy Sascha Matsola, who has cerebral palsy, cerebral hydrocephalus and complete blindness, will receive a special treadmill as a gift on 5 August at the Melikhovo Museum Reserve near Moscow.
A useful presentation will be presented to Sasha by Oksana Kosareva, Minister of Culture of Moscow Region, and Konstantin Bobkov, Director of the Museum.
Money for the simulator was raised during the charity marathon "Don't get tired of doing good," which took place in Melikhov on July 15, on Chekhov's Remembrance Day.
On the eve of the marathon, the museum received a letter from Sasha, who lives in the village of Manushkino, Chekhov District: "I can't see my eyes at all, so I asked my mother to write this letter."
'I'd love to get a treadmill as a gift to make my legs stronger and I'd love to learn to walk a little bit. '
And now Sashina's dream has come true!
After the presentation, a "post-scriptum concert" will take place in the museum-reserve. A well-known pianist, Honoured Artist of Russia, Alexander Gindin, will perform popcorn from popular classical compositions.
During the charity marathon in Melikhov, the Voznesenskaya Davydova Desert Choir, the bells of Ilya Drozdikhin's workshop, students of the Tchaikovsky Moscow Conservatory and the Gnesin Russian Academy, and artists from the Chekhov Studio Melikhov Theatre performed.
Auctions were held for visitors, a book fair and a charity sale of souvenirs bearing the marathon logo were organized.
The Melikhov Museum-Reserve has taken the initiative to make July 15 a single day of charity in all museums of the Moscow region.
A 30-year-old resident of Olevsk, Zhitomir region, near the local football stadium, shot several times at the teenagers who were there.
According to the suspect, he was angered by the noise, Fakty was informed by the Department of Communications of the Police of Zhitomir Region.
The man then entered a nearby cafe.
A dispute broke out in the building, during which a man used a rubber bullet to fire, wounding one of the visitors.
The 34-year-old victim received the necessary medical treatment, his life is not in danger.
Police and emergency medical services arrived at the scene, but the shooter fled by then.
Law enforcement officers identified him and detained him on the same day, 2 August.
The man could not explain his actions.
A device for firing rubber bullets was seized and sent for examination.
Criminal proceedings have been initiated under Article 296 (hooliganism) of the Criminal Code of Ukraine.
The detainee faces imprisonment for a term of 3 to 7 years.
Recall that in Kiev, on Lukyanovka Street near Tatarskaya Street, on the night of July 28, a shooting attack took place.
Michelle Carter Sentenced for Messages Inducing Conrad Roy's Suicide
A Massachusetts woman has been sentenced to two and a half years in prison for encouraging her boyfriend Conrad Roy to commit suicide through text messages and phone calls.
Michelle Carter, now 20, will have to serve 15 months of her sentence behind bars and an additional five years of probation.
Carter was convicted in June of involuntary manslaughter in the death of Conrad Roy, who committed suicide on July 13, 2014.
Roy's father told Thursday's hearing: "My family is heartbroken.
My son was my best friend. "
Carter was allowed to remain free pending an appeal.
She faced a maximum sentence of 20 years, but her lawyers said both she and Roy suffered from mental illness.
Carter, dressed in red trousers and a cream blouse, listened to the verdict with her hands clasped and her eyes lowered.
"By her actions she killed Conrad Roy," the prosecutor told the court.
"She interrupted his life to improve herself.
She has denied responsibility, "she said.
'She's shown no remorse. '
But Carter's lawyer said it was a "tragic case for which she deeply regrets."
But Judge Lawrence Monis said he did not think her "age, level of maturity or even mental illness had a noticeable impact on her actions."
The prosecutor read a statement from Roy's mother, Lynne Roy, which said: "Not a day has gone by when I have not mourned the loss of my beloved son.
I want him to be proud of me and how I'm coping - I'm trying to support his sisters despite all the pain that will stay with us forever, "it reads.
Roy's sister Camdin Roy said she was haunted by the thought that she would never be able to attend his wedding or become his children's aunt.
"To lose someone who has always been with me since I was born is a pain that will stay with me for the rest of my life," she said.
The case is likely to set a legal precedent, as Massachusetts has no law that makes it an offence to advise a person to commit suicide.
Carter was 17 when Roy was found dead in his car in 2014 with carbon monoxide poisoning symptoms.
The case gained national attention when it was revealed that he had been driven to suicide by Carter's messages.
"You can hang yourself, jump off a roof, stab yourself I don't know many ways," she wrote in several messages sent two weeks before his death while he was holidaying with his family.
Minutes before her suicide, she wrote: "You should do this, Conrad" and "You just need to turn on the ignition and you'll be free and happy."
Judge Monis said Carter wanted attention through Roy's death and banned her from speaking to the press to prevent her from getting what she wanted.
Legal opinion on this issue is divided.
One of the few who defended Carter was Amanda Knox, who was convicted in 2007 of murdering her British roommate in Italy and acquitted two years later.
Knox, 30, published a dissenting opinion in the Los Angeles Times that said, "Michelle Carter deserves sympathy and help, not jail."
Evgeny Bogachev: "I let Langford go like a high-flying bird"
One of the best basketball players in the VTB United League, 33-year-old Keith Langford, has left UNICS.
Evgeny Bogachev, President of UNICS, commented on the departure of the American defender to Izvestia.
Keith made this decision for family reasons, said Evgeny Bogachev.
He has a young child, a wife, who did not want to move to Kazan.
Keith wants to be closer to home.
I decided to go along with it.
Of course, I could have said no and extended his contract, but he deserved different treatment.
He played three seasons at UNICS and showed a high level in every match, giving 100%.
So I let him go like a high-flying bird.
We thanked him.
We wish him every success in his family life and playing career.
Keith Langford played for the Kazan club for three years, winning United League silver in 2015 / 16.
In the 2016 / 17 season, he received the award for the most productive player of the Euroleague season.
He averaged 21.75 points per game.
This result is the second since 2004, when the award was established.
Langford, who also won the award in 2014, became the second player in Euroleague history to win the award more than once.
Langford will soon sign a contract with China's Shenzhen, Eurohoops reports.
The American is expected to sign a two-year contract worth $5 million.
Langford will become the second Euroleague star in July to move to the Chinese Super League.
Earlier, former Panathinaikos central defender Yannis Bourousis moved to the Chinese CBA.
A tourist from Moscow region who was burned in the sun was evacuated by helicopter to Adygea
Today, Adygea rescuers evacuated by helicopter a tourist from the mountainous region of the Republic near Moscow who had received severe sunburn.
The man had a rest in the Fisht shelter, which is located at an altitude of 1,600 meters.
The 27-year-old tourist had high blood pressure and difficulty breathing.
The preliminary diagnosis is a serious allergic reaction.
Rescuers were contacted by the head of the tour group, who said that the man had suffered burns during the hike.
Audi to retrofit up to 850,000 diesel cars
A day before Audi's announcement, BMW said it would offer software upgrades to more than 350,000 vehicles.
The BMW chairman said the company believes that "there are more intelligent ways than driving restrictions," referring to European cities - including Munich, where BMW is based - that have considered banning or restricting the use of diesel cars.
Daimler said Thursday that it will modify three million Mercedes cars in Europe to reduce their diesel exhaust.
Neither company called its move a recall.
European automakers have been actively promoting the use of diesel cars in Europe and the United States to help enforce carbon-dioxide regulations.
But nitrogen oxides emitted by diesel engines are considered carcinogens and can cause asthma.
The cost to automakers of installing exhaust-neutralizing equipment for diesel cars is also rising, and it is becoming difficult to maintain a competitive price for automobiles.
While German automakers are under scrutiny, Chancellor Angela Merkel's government has also been accused of pandering to powerful automakers and ignoring signs of the problem.
Companies are careful not to repeat the mistakes of Volkswagen, which concealed the use of so-called "kill devices," which, during testing, could adjust the amount of harmful gases emitted to comply with the rules and, under normal driving conditions, were switched off.
Several Volkswagen executives have been convicted in the United States, and others are under investigation on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month, the former head of the thermodynamics department at Audi's engine development group was arrested in Germany.
The former manager, Zacchio Giovanni Pamio, is Italian and therefore not protected from extradition and could face trial in the United States.
Earlier this year, Audi came under German criminal investigation involving Volkswagen after authorities accused it of installing the system to circumvent European emissions rules and expanded an investigation that had previously focused on the United States.
Including Audi in the investigation could create serious problems for Volkswagen: the luxury automaker generates a disproportionate share of Volkswagen's revenue.
In Astrakhan, a cafe visitor paid with counterfeit money
The police received a report from an employee of a branch of the bank about the discovery of a suspicious 5 thousand rouble note during the recalculation of funds received from a food service point.
A study carried out at the Forensics Centre showed that it was false.
According to the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Russia in the Astrakhan region, one of the visitors to the cafe who bought the shaurma paid the bill.
It should be noted that the cash register was not equipped with a device to determine the authenticity of banknotes.
Currently, the police are identifying individuals involved in the production and sale of a knowingly forged ticket by the Central Bank of the Russian Federation.
Such crimes are punishable by up to 8 years in prison and a fine of up to 1 million roubles.
The Regional Directorate of the Ministry of Internal Affairs urges residents of Astrakhan Oblast to be careful when making financial transactions; employees of trading facilities are advised to install devices to verify the authenticity of the funds received.
Astronomers have found a 'hellish' planet where even iron can melt
Having first studied the stratosphere properties of a giant exoplanet called WASP-121b, astrophysicists were quite surprised by its temperature, which can evaporate iron and other metals.
Experts have noticed that water molecules are so heated by the star's light that they emit infrared radiation.
The Hubble telescope captured the glow of water molecules on this gas giant: this high temperature causes water in the planet's atmosphere to glow in the infrared range.
WASP-121b belongs to the so-called "hot Jupiter" - gas giants, comparable in size and mass to the largest planet in the solar system, but located tens of times closer to its parent star.
Because of this, the year on the exoplanet lasts only 1.3 "earthly" days, "and its gaseous shell is heated to almost 2,500 degrees Celsius.
Climate change threatens lavender in Provence.
It has become a symbol of Provence and southern France, but there are now fears that it is threatened by climate change.
Lavender has grown worse because of dry weather and disease-carrying insects, causing a constant headache for scientists and farmers trying to find a solution.
Eric Chez, an expert at the Provence-based agricultural research institute CRIEPPAM, said: "Lavender in Provence is really under threat because in recent years the plant has been feeling the effects of climate change, with much less rain in the spring and especially in the autumn.
This affects the lavender's lifespan.
And then there are the little cicadas, leaf-hopping insects that carry micro-bacteria; in very dry weather, there are a lot of them. "
There is a lot at stake.
Lavender not only attracts vacationers; lavender oil is in great demand in perfumery and cosmetology.
Eric Shas says: "Instead of very long ears with a lot of large flowers, we have small, underdeveloped, weak or non-existent ears.
So we have fewer parts containing essential oil. "
Solutions under consideration include improving water distribution and slowing evaporation from the soil, spraying plants with a protective mixture of clay and water, and developing drought-resistant varieties.
Ambassador of the Winter Universiade-2019 met with Krasnoyarsk schoolchildren
Two-time world champion in ice hockey, Ambassador of the 2019 Winter Universiade Alexander Semin met the day before with novice ice ice hockey players and handed out autographs to fans.
The meeting took place in the tent of the Winter Universiade-2019 within the framework of the thematic week devoted to ice hockey.
Any visitor to the tent could skate on an artificial ice rink.
In addition, relays, quizzes and games with student games souvenirs were organized, as well as warm-ups from the aerobics federation.
The event was attended by 50 schoolchildren.
Alexander Semin advised the children to practice as much as possible on sports grounds and stressed that the most important thing at the initial stage of training was hard work and a huge desire to play hockey.
"It is great that in Krasnoyarsk there is such a platform as the tent of the Winter Universiade-2019, where aspiring athletes can directly ask questions to the coaches of the teams," the champion said.
It should be noted that the ambassadors of the Winter Universiade-2019 help to promote student sports and a healthy lifestyle among Krasnoyarsk residents.
The Universiade tent will work throughout the summer season until September 25, the press service of the Directorate of Winter Universiade 2019 reports.
The State Department commented on Medvedev's words
U.S. State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert, commenting at the briefing on the words of Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev, said it was necessary to find "areas for interaction" with Russia.
According to her, such areas should be identified in order to "improve bilateral interaction."
Nauert cited the truce agreement on Syria as an example of such successful cooperation.
We are two nuclear superpowers.
"And people around the world agree that the US and Russia should be able to work with each other," the diplomat said.
At the same time, Nauert declined to comment on Medvedev's assertion of a full-fledged trade war between Russia and the United States.
"If Russia has said that, then, of course, it has the right to say it, but I can't say anything more about it," the State Department spokeswoman said.
Earlier, US President Donald Trump signed a bill to tighten sanctions against the Russian Federation.
Commenting on the new package of sanctions, Russian Prime Minister Medvedev said that Washington has declared a full-fledged trade war on Moscow, putting an end to hopes for improved bilateral relations.
Medvedev also said that US sanctions would last for decades.
Moreover, the prime minister believes that the US establishment has "squandered" Trump.
A bodybuilder who went missing in the Moscow region has been found at someone else's dacha having lost his memory
Bodybuilder Shamil Khanmetov went missing on the road to Noginsk on July 25 in very piquant circumstances: he left the interior of the car to go to the toilet.
For seven days, acquaintances and locals searched in vain for him.
And Shamil found himself in someone else's country house in Ramenskoye.
He was found completely naked in his toilet by his owner.
The Dagestan athlete could not explain how he appeared here and what happened to him.
He couldn't even remember his name and his passport was missing.
Announcements about his disappearance helped to identify him.
Medics who arrived on the call recorded Khanmetov's partial memory loss and a head injury, Mash Public reported.
Other surprises are likely to await the athlete.
The perpetrators of Shamil's abduction must have already visited his apartment, the keys to which were also stolen from him.
July oil and gas revenues exceeded forecasts by 7.4 billion roubles
In fact, according to the results of July 2017, the oil and gas revenues received exceeded the estimate by 7.4 billion roubles, the Ministry of Finance of the Russian Federation reports.
Excess, as the agency explains, was mainly due to the higher exchange rate of the US dollar to the rouble compared to the monthly average of June, used for the assessment, as well as due to the excess of actual gas production and exports of petroleum products at the forecast levels.
"The deviation of oil and gas revenues of the federal budget from the monthly assessment in accordance with the Federal Law on the Federal Budget for 2017-2019 is projected to amount to + 40.2 billion roubles in August 2017," the Ministry of Finance said in a statement.
Thus, the total amount of funds allocated for the purchase of foreign currency on the domestic currency market in the period from August 7 to September 6, 2017 amounts to 47.6 billion roubles.
Accordingly, the daily volume of foreign currency purchases will amount to the equivalent of 2.07 billion roubles.
The Bank of Russia will be involved in the purchase of foreign currency by the Ministry of Finance of Russia.
Every working day during the specified period, the Central Bank will conclude foreign currency purchase deals on the organized trades of the Moscow Exchange evenly during the trading day.
Acquired foreign currency will be deposited into the Federal Treasury accounts at the Central Bank.
The murder of the journalist underscores that Mexico is becoming increasingly dangerous.
The staff of the weekly newspaper Riodos usually meet on Wednesday to discuss plans to cover the latest violent crimes in Sinaloa involving organized crime, corrupt officials, or the ongoing drug war.
But today, overwhelmed by their own tragedy, they met to talk about security.
They were told they had to change their habits.
Two senior journalists discussed what seemed safer: taking the children with them to an office where a grenade had already been thrown in 2009, or leaving them at home.
Security experts wrote three words on a blackboard hanging in the room: enemies, neutrals, allies.
They asked journalists to name names for each column - proof is not needed, suspicions and inner feelings will suffice.
They are drug traffickers, politicians, businessmen, journalists who are suspected of being paid by the government or the cartels, a litany of villains who make the job of covering Mexico's chaos dangerous.
Violence provides no respite, and more and more journalists are among the country's multiplying corpses: according to the Committee to Protect Journalists, at least 25 have died since President Enrico Pena Nieto took office in December 2012; 589 people are under federal protection following attacks and threats; and at least seven people have died in seven states so far this year.
Among the latter is their publisher and co-founder, Javier Valdez Cárdenas.
"The biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist," Valdez wrote in one of his many books on violent drug crimes.
His absence is keenly felt, though his presence is ubiquitous - a large photograph of Valdez showing his middle finger with the words "Justice" hanging on the facade of the Riodos building; two reporters in their 30s, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramírez, wear T-shirts depicting his smile, face in glasses, or his trademark panama.
The seminar comes less than two months after his death; journalists discuss their shared trauma, nightmares, insomnia, paranoia.
Although a special federal prosecutor's office was established in 2010 to investigate journalistic cases, only two cases have been investigated so far, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists.
As with most of the thousands of drug-related and organized-crime-related killings each year, the killers of journalists are rarely brought to justice.
Riodos journalists insist that they will write about the violence in Sinaloa, even though they have been killed by grief, though it is now much more dangerous around them.
Without information about the killers, without justice, there is little use in talking about security at meetings, Ibarra said.
"It's very foolish to waste time on this seminar," he says.
"While we don't know the cause, we suspect everyone."
On the morning of May 15, Valdés left the offices of Riodos in the state capital of Culiacán.
He managed to drive only a couple of blocks before his red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men; he was pulled out of the car and shot 12 times, probably because of the newspaper's name - which means "Twelfth River."
The gunman drove away in his car and crashed it nearby.
Valdés was 50.
He is survived by his wife and two adult children.
Rumors usually quickly spread about Culiacan.
But almost everyone is silent about Valdés.
Since Guzman was arrested and extradited to the US last January, Sinaloa has become one of the country's bloodiest battlefields, as rival factions struggle to fill the vacuum.
Let us not say that one or more people are killed every day in the streets of Sinaloa, or that the cemetery is filled with the decorated two-story mausoleums of the drug kings, which are larger than the homes of many living people.
Forget for a moment that a state of "calm" is simply when one of the cartels takes control of a coastal state with important ports and drug routes leading to the US.
Despite this, and the fact that Valdés was aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Bojorquez, the 60-year-old co-founder and director of Riodos, is crushed by guilt at not being able to protect his friend.
He thinks two mistakes helped the killing.
First, in February, an interview was published with Damaso Lopez, the leader of one of the cartel's rival factions fighting Guzmán's sons.
The publication may have angered the sons; people believed to be gang members bought all the copies as soon as they arrived at the newsstands.
The second mistake was that he did not force Valdés to leave the country for his own safety after another newspaper that was writing about the same story was seized.
Valdés was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his murder was seen as another milestone in the development of violence against journalists in Mexico.
He had been away from danger for so long, his friends and colleagues thought he would always be.
He was an experienced reporter at Noroeste and founded Riodos with five colleagues in 2003, selling his 50-dollar shares.
In Sinaloa, "it was impossible to do journalism without talking about drugs," Bojorquez said.
Over time, the newspaper earned a reputation as a bold and honest publication, with sales and advertising revenues growing.
Journalists liked to be able to report boldly without fear of censorship, and readers were attracted to be able to read about things that no one else dared to write about.
Eight years after its founding, Rio de Janeiro received the prestigious Maria Murs Cabo Prize for reporting in Latin America.
That same year, Valdés won the International Press Freedom Prize for his courage in investigating Mexico's drug trade wherever it led.
He candidly admitted that he was scared.
"I want to move on," he said at the CPJ awards.
Drug trafficking in Sinaloa is "a way of life," he said in an interview with Rompiento TV last October.
"You have to accept the tasks that fall on you as a journalist - either that or you're just fooling around."
I don't want to be asked, "What did you do when there were so many deaths around... why didn't you say what was going on?"
Riodos staff miss Valdés, the joker who swore like a port porter, the friend generous with hugs and advice, the teacher who knew how to get away with it.
They relied on the order he had established.
He had to wear his hat at all times.
He had to go to El Guayabo, the bar opposite the office, and always sit there at the same table.
Now they ask: has his love of the once-established order destroyed him?
His death also made them question their calculations about how best to do their job and stay alive.
"They don't like it when you look at their wives, their children, their legal businesses and their clandestine airfields for drugs.
"These things were out of bounds," Bojorquez said.
The result, even in the best of times, has been a high level of self-censorship and self-preservation.
You have to trust your instincts.
Stay away from anything that smells bad.
The problem, says the editor of Riodosa, Andrés Villareal, is that "the sense of smell can be deceived... and then what happened to Javier happens."
The old rules, he and others say, no longer apply in Sinaloa - as they do in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero, and other states, where there is a toxic mix of lucrative smuggling routes, weak state institutions, and corrupt officials.
The landscape is constantly changing.
Cell phones were suddenly banned from entering the room where Riodos staff had gathered for a security training, days before it was revealed that spyware, sold exclusively to governments, was being used in Mexico to spy on journalists and social activists.
Outside, two police officers take refuge in the shade of a tree in the 104-degree heat (40 degrees Celsius).
They were assigned by the state government to guard the office of Riodos, which is located in a four-story building in the bourgeois quarter of Culiacán.
Some journalists half-jokingly asked if these policemen were among the 50 percent of law enforcement officers whom the governor himself said could not be trusted.
A few months ago, journalists traveled to a mountainous area that is under the de facto control of drug gangs.
In the next issue, "Riodos" counted on three main themes.
It is the killing in Sinaloa of the brother of former boxing champion Julio Cesar Chavez.
Then there was the exposure of government spending concentrated in the governor's hometown.
And there was a gang kidnapping at one of Culiacan's most expensive restaurants, a block from the prosecutor's office.
There was no official announcement of who was kidnapped or how, so care had to be taken when it came time to write about what everyone in the city knew: that it was a favorite restaurant of both drug dealers and the authorities.
One journalist learned from open databases that the restaurant was registered in the name of a politician belonging to the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), which has dominated all levels of government for most of the past century.
Recently, several PRI governors have faced high-profile corruption charges.
Villarreal asked journalists to write about previous incidents at the restaurant, including when "El Chapo" Guzman's son escaped a military raid.
Until a few months ago, readers would have been looking for Valdez's column with the most accurate information about the kidnapping.
"Before, we would have known what had happened," said 46-year-old Villarreal, nicknamed "El Flaco" for his lean physique.
"Today, all channels of communication with our sources have been severed."
Valdés's office is now being used as a warehouse for posters and stickers protesting the murder of journalists, because the staff have become what they never thought they would become: activists acting on behalf of the press.
Journalist Miriam Ramírez took some posters and went the next morning to a demonstration at the local prosecutor's office dedicated to another journalist.
Salvador Adame disappeared in the western state of Michoacán three days after Valdez was killed.
A burned body was found and authorities said it was him, based on DNA tests.
Across the country, journalists began to speak out, organize protests, and write "SOS Press" on sidewalks and walls.
Director Bojorquez was in Washington that day, seeking international support for demanding justice in Valdez's case.
In a meeting with the governor of Sinaloa the day after Valdez was killed, Ramírez accused the authorities of spying on journalists and ordering their killings for telling the truth.
She then asked not to be given any more assignments covering the government for fear that anger would damage her objectivity.
Valdés has said many times that journalists in Mexico are "surrounded" by organized crime, its accomplices in the government, and an indifferent society.
In his latest book, Drug Journalism, he wrote that reporters are not just killed by drug gangs; they do so on the orders of politicians and security services in collusion with organized crime.
The Committee to Protect the Press, Article 19, estimates that half of the attacks on journalists last year were ordered by police and government officials.
"In Mexico, you die because they want to shut you up," says Ramírez.
Of course, the killings scare people.
Everyone remembers the death of blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias six years ago in the northern border state of Tamaulipas.
A note, allegedly written on behalf of the Zetas cartel, was found on her body: "I am here because of my articles."
A computer keyboard and headphones lay next to her severed head.
Some outlets have chosen to close, such as El Norte in the northern border state of Chihuahua, after its correspondent, Miroslava Brich, was killed in March.
Others continue to hold out, like "El Maniana" of Nuevo Laredo after its leader was assassinated in 2004.
In 2010, Diario de Ciudad Juárez publicly addressed the drug cartels with a front-page editorial entitled "What do you want us to do?"
Some journalists have left their home states or even the country.
It is a painful decision.
In exile, it is difficult to find work, and they continue to look for danger on the streets.
And sometimes they are killed, as was apparently the case with photographer Ruben Espinoza, who was killed in 2015, along with four women, in an apartment in Mexico City three months after fleeing Veracruz.
Those who remain and continue to work are balancing the risks on a daily basis.
Ibarra - who once dreamed of being a poet - admits that he dreads writing about the drug trade.
"Mexico is going to hell and that's why I became a journalist," he says.
Last Friday, at midnight, when the latest issue was ready to be printed, the publishers of Riodos were sitting on the sidewalk outside the office and drinking beer when suddenly their phones rang at the same time.
A series of shootings between rival gangs and security forces near the resort town of Mazatlan has left 19 bodies confirmed.
The war continued to escalate, as promised in a series of messages from cartels found in the area.
Sitting on the pavement, they posted the news on the Riodos website via their mobile phone.
The next day, the first page had to be rewritten.
Sirens sounded nearby - another exchange of gunfire in the vicinity.
Bojorquez looked to see if the police officers guarding them were ready to defend themselves.
If they were scared, they showed no sign of it.
Sitting beneath a huge portrait of the late founder of their newspaper, whose middle finger was on display throughout Sinaloa, Riodos officers pursued his case.
"How can you think of closing down," Bojorquez said, "if on the very day Javier was killed, the intern asked me to send her outside to report?"
The dinosaur used camouflage to avoid enemies
At first glance, he seems like a statue, albeit a terrifying one.
Researchers have revealed that the first remains of an incredible rhino-sized creature discovered by a Canadian miner have been so well preserved that experts have dubbed it the "Mona Lisa among the dinosaurs."
It was so well preserved that they were even able to identify that the color of his scaly skin was reddish-brown - and say that he had, in some ways, a "dark past."
In a report published in the journal Modern Biology, it was described as "the best-preserved Tyreophorus ever found and one of the best dinosaur specimens in the world."
The fossil is a newly discovered specimen of a nodosaurus that lived in the middle of the Cretaceous period, between 110 million and 112 million years ago.
His incredible good fortune has stunned researchers, who call him "truly remarkable."
This herbivore thyreophorus is the best-preserved fossil of its kind ever found, according to articles in the journal National Geographic.
He was found by Sean Funk while he was working at Suncor's Millennium mine near Fort McMurray in northern Alberta, Canada, on March 21, 2011.
He came across something that seemed to be different from the surrounding rock, and decided to take a closer look.
The fossil he discovered was sent to the Royal Tyrrells Paleontological Museum.
For the next six years, work was carried out to find the animal inside the 2,500-foot (1,100-kilogram) rock.
Now that all this hard work has been done, the finished product can be demonstrated.
"You only have to squint a little and you can almost believe he's asleep," said lead author Caleb Brown, a researcher at the Royal Tyrrell Paleontology Museum, where the creation is being shown.
"It will go down in the history of science as one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaur specimens - the Mona Lisa among dinosaurs."
Examining its skin, the researchers found that this herbivore, despite being covered in shell and resembling a walking tank, was likely to have been exposed to significant danger from carnivorous dinosaurs.
This powerful shell-covered dinosaur used a red-and-white camouflage to hide from predators, and employed a protective technique known as protective coloring, which is also used by many animals today.
This would allow it to merge more quickly with its environment and avoid meeting enemies, experts say, suggesting it was hunted by larger dinosaurs.
The 110 million-year-old creature, part of the nodosaurus family, made headlines in May and is now on display at the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology.
Scientists have already studied the animal and named it Borealopelta markmitchelli after museum lab technician Mark Mitchell, one of the team members who spent more than 7,000 hours excavating it.
The remarkable preservation of the specimen allowed Dr Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and shape of the scales and shell plates on his body.
They found protective coloring, a common method of protection in the animal kingdom, meaning that the top of the creature was darker than its underside.
Although protective coloring is common, the discovery came as a surprise because the Borealopelta dinosaur is much larger than today's protective-coloring animals.
It can be assumed that this dinosaur was so actively hunted by carnivores that evolution chose to camouflage confrontation as a means of survival.
But most modern animals with protective coloring - such as deer, zebras, or battleships - are much smaller and more accessible prey, suggesting that the nodosaurus had a serious fight for survival.
"The serious threat from predators to the massive, shell-covered dinosaur shows how dangerous the predatory dinosaurs of the Cretaceous period were," Brown said.
Chemical analysis of the organic compounds in the dinosaur's scales also suggests that its skin must have been reddish-brown.
Scientists continue to study the animal, looking for clues about its life, including the preserved contents of its digestive tract, to find out what it ate during its last meal.
They believe that when the dinosaur died, it fell into the river and was carried into the sea, where it sank and lay with its back down on the ocean floor.
Back then, Alberta was as warm as south Florida is now, and rivers and oceans were likely to have spread much farther inland than they are now.
"This nodosaurus is truly remarkable in that it is completely covered with preserved scaly skin, and at the same time completely preserved in three dimensions, preserving the original shape of the animal," Brown said.
"As a result, the animal looks much the same now as it did then, in the Early Cretaceous period.
It doesn't take much imagination to recreate it, just a little squinting, and you can almost believe he's asleep. "
The Cretaceous period was the era when giant theropods, carnivorous two-legged dinosaurs, roamed the Earth.
Although the most remarkable of them, Tyrannosaurus rex, lived millions of years later than Borealopelta, some of its formidable ancestors could have hunted for the thyroid.
They include an acrocantosaurus, a monster measuring 38 feet (11.5 meters) long and weighing six tons.
The scientists, whose latest findings are published in the journal Modern Biology, believe that Borealopelta was carried into the sea after its death and mummified in silt.
The creature was found by Sean Funk while he was working at the Millennium Mine near Fort McMurray in northern Alberta, Canada, on March 21, 2011.
According to museum staff, it is the best-preserved thyrophorus in the world, together with the skin and shell, and it is intact, from the snout to the femur bones.
On average, the creatures were about 18 feet (five meters) long and weighed up to 3,000 pounds (1,300 kilograms).
They were characterized by two twenty-inch spikes protruding from their shoulders.
Researchers believe the herbivore thyreophorus was treading hard on what is now Canada until a spilled river carried it out to sea.
But the underwater burial of the dinosaur preserved its shell to the smallest detail.
The fossilised remains of this particular specimen are so well preserved that the remains of the skin still cover the rugged shell plates along the dinosaur's skull.
As Michael Gresko wrote in an article for National Geographic magazine, such a degree of preservation is "rare as winning the lottery."
The longer I look at it, the more astounding it seems.
Fossilized remains of skin still cover the rugged shell plates that dot the animal's skull.
His right front leg is stretched out along his side, five fingers on it turned up.
I can count the scales on his sole. "
Mikhail Saakashvili managed to get to Poland without documents
Mikheil Saakashvili, who previously headed Georgia and then Ukraine's Odessa region, flew to Poland.
However, he did so without proof of his identity and nationality.
The arrival of Saakashvili is reported by the Polish publication Telewizja Republika, which posted a video of his speech on its YouTube channel.
Saakashvili spoke at an event commemorating the anniversary of the Warsaw Uprising against Hitler's troops in 1944.
Because the politician does not know Polish, even though he tried to start speaking in that language, he had to speak in English through a Polish interpreter.
During his speech, the politician touched upon the topic of cooperation between Georgia and Poland, as well as spoke about Ukraine.
The disgraced politician learned that the Ukrainian Migration Service had stripped him of his citizenship while he was in the United States.
Exactly how he managed to make the transatlantic flight without papers is not yet known.
Earlier, the former governor of the Odessa region, Mikhail Saakashvili, said that his signature on the questionnaire for obtaining Ukrainian citizenship was forged.
The politician stressed that he had not filled out any questionnaires.
The investigation into Weinzikher and Olkhovik has been extended until January
The term of the preliminary investigation into the case of the co-owner of the Renov Group of Companies, Evgeny Olkhovik, and the head of the T Plus energy holding, Boris Vainzikher, has been extended until 2 January 2018.
On Thursday, 3 August, the Basmann Court is considering the extension of the accused's house arrest.
A UK representative at the meeting announced the decision to extend the preliminary investigation for the last time.
"The special complexity and duration of the investigation is due to the need to seize and conduct an expert examination of a large number of documents, as well as to conduct investigative actions on the territory of several subjects of the Russian Federation," the investigator stated.
He added that the suspects regularly paid bribes to Comey's leadership.
Their total value is estimated at no less than one billion roubles.
According to the investigation, Vainzikher, Olkhovik, and Mikhail Slobodin, the former head of JSC Integrated Energy Systems, who until September 5 headed Vimpelcom, handed over bribes to senior officials of the Republic of Komi for setting the most favorable tariffs for heat and electricity, as well as for creating favorable conditions for business.
Vainzikher and Olkhovik were detained, transferred to Syktyvkar and arrested for two months, Slobodin fled the investigation and was put on the federal wanted list.
How did one activist know the answer to the question "Whose streets?"
On August 9, 2014, Brittany Ferrel was shocked to the core.
Just a day after arriving in New York on a tourist trip, the St. Louis native was sitting on a bed in an apartment rented through Airbnb, browsing the Facebook feed on her phone.
She came across the post of someone from high school.
It said: "The police have just killed an 18-year-old child and he is still lying in the middle of the street."
Noticing that no one else on her feed had memorized the information, puzzled, she shut down Facebook and opened Twitter.
Her feed had many posts from a user with the username @ ThePharoah.
The Greater St. Louis rapper tweeted live coverage of the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed black 18-year-old who was shot dead by a white police officer in Ferguson, Missouri.
He posted a photo of Brown's lifeless body sprawled out in the street, where it will remain for four hours.
"It's savagery," Ferrel thought.
But death was nothing new for her and her circle.
She put her phone down and later in the evening returned to tweets about people gathering on Canfield Drive.
There were photos of the signal tape and screaming people and a man claiming to be Brown's father holding a placard that said, "The Ferguson police officer just killed my unarmed son!"
She watched a live broadcast of a police officer standing in front of a group of protesters with a barking dog.
In another video, another policeman, she said, pulled the trigger of a rifle and shouted, "I'm going to kill you all... animals!"
"It's an unusual situation," Ferrel said at the time.
"It's not the kind of killing that we're used to and that we can call typical.
At that moment, I felt chills.
I was angry and crying. "
She picked up a ticket for the return flight and flew home the next day.
Landing at 11pm, she picked up her six-year-old daughter from her father's house and decided that they would both go to Ferguson the next morning.
What happened to Ferrel and Ferguson over the next almost three years is the subject of a new documentary, Whose Streets?, which will be released on August 11.
It is a story of survival and protest, of love and loss, of strength and resilience from the point of view of people living in a community and filling the streets demanding answers.
As Ferrel drove to Ferguson with her daughter, dressed in a flower dress and flower wreath, they recalled a conversation they had had countless times before this morning "about the experience of black people and their situation."
She recalls saying, "Do you remember me telling you how black people had to fight for what they believed in?
We're going to Ferguson right now because an 18-year-old boy was killed by a police officer, and that was wrong. "
"I couldn't help but take it," Ferrel said later.
"What is happening today is the culmination of what... happened before.
She should know about it, see it, and be educated on it.
She must not only be well versed in activism and organization, but also understand the different levels of black experience and position, and what we must do to be free to emancipate ourselves.
Even if I manage to provide her with an environment in which she herself does not encounter blatant racism, she is no different from any other black girl.
I feel I would be doing her a disservice by shielding her from it. "
When they arrived in Ferguson, they made their first stop on South Florissant Road, a site across the street from a police station that has become something of a tent camp, as activists waited for reports of Officer Darren Wilson's eventual innocence.
There, Ferrel and his daughter joined a local entrepreneur preparing lunch bags.
They collected bags and helped distribute them to protesters.
Little by little, a new type of activism took shape in Ferrel's mind.
"My activism changed completely after August 9," she said, noting that as a student at the University of Missouri-St. Louis, she was president of the Association of Minority Nursing Students, and worked on food justice and health inequality among black communities.
"I had no experience as an organizer.
It came on its own. "
A few weeks later, at an evening screening, Ferrel met Sabaa Folayan, one of her co-directors.
Folayan said she and her principal cameraman, Lucas Alvarado-Ferrer, "just wanted to document" the events.
Ferrel asked, "Do you want to document, or are you trying to find a story to play on?"
This skepticism was inspired by the many people, often white, who came to the community to benefit from its pain and resilience.
As Folayan explained in a recent interview, "We heard that the voices of people who were born and raised in Ferguson don't get the spotlight, and we wanted to do it differently."
Folayan had already teamed up with her co-director, Damon Davis, a local artist known for his activism on death row.
His involvement aroused sympathy for the project among Ferrel and six other locals with whom the Whose Streets? project team had been in touch in the years since Brown's murder.
"In this documentary, it's not someone talking for us or with us, it's us talking for ourselves," Davis said.
"That was the most important thing for me about how these people will be represented, because that's how I'll be represented."
Although the project was not intended to focus on Ferrel's experience - in an effort to show that the movement "is not about a savior leader, but about how the community comes together," as Folayan put it - it was the most open of the participants in the film.
As a result, Whose Streets? shows unexpectedly personal aspects of Ferrel's life, such as how she fell in love and married her wife.
"I felt naked," Ferrel said, laughing as she described the first time she saw the finished product.
"But I understood that when you do this kind of work and humanize black people, there must be some level of vulnerability."
Ferrel's story also revisits and highlights the role of black homosexual women in the broader context of the Black Lives Matter movement.
Two of the movement's three founders - those who created the # BlackLivesMatter hashtag on social media after the 2012 shooting of black teenager Trayvon Martin - identify as homosexuals.
"Black gay women in leadership positions support the whole movement," Ferrel said, "and that's because we're constantly fighting on several fronts.
Black homosexual women have to bear all this burden. "
Folayan agreed, noting that "the movement is actually supported by black women and a lot of homosexual black women."
However, she insists that "this is not a case of positive discrimination," and that Ferrell was not chosen to star in the film because of her distinctive features.
"She was the person who awakened that energy," she said.
"On the other hand, it is no coincidence that it came to the fore because when"
You can feel its energy through the screen. "
Meanwhile, Ferguson has long had no cameras, but complex racial ties between the community and the police remain.
Ferrel will be on probation for another two and a half years for blocking a highway during the demonstration.
She describes the sociopolitical atmosphere of the place she calls home simply: "Bardak."
She still clings to the speech she learned when she took to the streets of Ferguson three years ago.
We must fight for our freedom.
We have to win.
We must love and support each other.
We have nothing to lose but our chains. "
Two Salvadoran soccer players disqualified for biting US players
El Salvador's soccer players, Henry Romero and Darwin Ceren, received lengthy disqualifications for unsportsmanlike conduct.
During the quarterfinals of the Confederations Cup of North and Central America and the Caribbean (CONCACAF), Salvadorans bitten American players.
Defenseman Henry Romero was the first to score.
The Salvadoran bit striker Jozy Altidore before pinching his chest.
Midfielder Ceren then bit US defender Omar Gonzalez while serving a corner in his own penalty area.
As a result, Romero was disqualified for three matches and Ceren for six.
The meeting itself ended with a 2-0 victory for the Americans, Goal.com.
Emerging similarities: An artist creates portraits using Chelsea Manning's DNA
In the center of the room at the Friedman Gallery in New York, people's faces - white, black, and brown, all ineffectually similar - hang from the ceiling on a wire.
The 30 portraits were created by artist Heather Dewey-Harborg from cheek swabs and hair clippings sent to her by Chelsea Manning.
Manning sent the clippings from Fort Leavenworth prison, where the former intelligence analyst is serving a 35-year sentence for famously passing confidential diplomatic cables to WikiLeaks.
The new exhibition, which opened on 2 August, is called "The Emergence of similarity."
It is the result of two years of correspondence between Dewey-Harborg, whose art combines technology, computer science, and the arts, and Manning, a transgender woman and famous dissident whom Barack Obama commuted just three days before the end of his presidency.
By analyzing Manning's DNA using a computer program and using it to create three-dimensional portraits of faces that people with such a genome might have, Dewey-Harborg has created a profound, if difficult-to-read manifesto that focuses not only on the plasticity of DNA data - the different ways in which they are interpreted and the inherent determinism of these interpretations - but also on the concept of identity.
Manning, who was born Bradley Edward but has openly said since her teens that she considers herself a woman, was sentenced in 2013 to 20 counts, including six violations of the Espionage Act, computer fraud and theft.
Her photos in prison were not available, so only one photo of her was known: a grainy black-and-white selfie in which Manning, wearing a platinum-tinted wig and clearly feeling uncomfortable, sits at the wheel of a car, with which she has come to be associated.
In 2015, Dewey-Harborg completed her 2012 project Stranger Visions with great success.
In it, the artist created portraits of unknown people using forensic evidence such as cigarette butts and chewing gum, extracting DNA from the debris and creating images of what those people might look like.
And then she got an email from Paper Magazine.
"They interviewed Chelsea Manning in prison and wanted some portrait to illustrate the article," Dewey-Hagborg explained at a preview of a new press exhibition.
At the time, Chelsea couldn't be visited or photographed, so they contacted her and asked if she wanted a portrait made from her DNA.
In an unusual way, the artist and her imprisoned muse became friends by correspondence and exchanged several letters over the course of two years.
They even wrote a comic book, "Suppressed Images," illustrated by Shoili Kanungo, who imagined that in the future the president would commute Chelsea's punishment so that she could visit the exhibition in person.
That Obama did decide to release Manning just days after the book's release was a pleasant surprise after seven tough years in a military prison in Kansas.
There is also something profound and powerful in the fact that the exhibition is opening right now, as Donald Trump declares war on people who disclose classified information in government and invents new ways to stoke the Twitter animosity that he is meant to soften.
When asked about the coincidence of the timing, Dewey-Harborg said "nothing happens by accident."
In the artist's statement written on the gallery wall, Manning's huge signature at the bottom (with a heart instead of a dot above the "i" in her surname) calls for an end to "automatic segregation based on gender, race, sexual orientation, and culture."
On the opposite side is her mitochondrial DNA, a long caterpillar of pencil-written C, G, and A.
By including 200 letters (or nucleotides, as the artist puts it scientifically, delicately), Dewey-Harborg hoped to show how remarkably similar we are, at least in our biological structure.
"I hope to explain to people that our genome does not determine what we are, how open genetic data is to interpretation, and how subjective it is," said Dewey-Harborg, whose 2007 video work "False Memories" is also on display here.
"DNA data can tell us so many different stories, and 30 of those stories are here."
The last part of the exhibition, which fits in one room, is the aforementioned comic novel.
In it, Manning appears King Kong-style above the US Correctional Barracks with a loudspeaker in his hand.
"If they kill your speech, they will win," it says.
"So never shut up."
"It's a direct quote from a letter she wrote to me," says the Philadelphia-based artist.
'I still get goosebumps when I'm talking about it. '
Manning has not yet seen the exhibition in person - as presciently depicted in the comics - but when she arrives, she will be greeted by masks in the center of the room, her own genome simulators, gathered like crowds of protesters.
This is as deliberate as anything in the exhibition down to the height (5 "2, Manning's height) on which the genetic haplogroups were drawn in pencil.
"I used to hang them on the walls, but now I want them to look like a crowd of people," Dewey-Harborg says of the portraits.
'I wanted them to be like the grassroots movement that formed around Chelsea, the movement that was behind her liberation as well. '
Northwestern University professor and Oxford University employee wanted by police on murder charges
A Northwestern University professor and an Oxford University employee are being hunted nationwide as suspects after a man was found stabbed to death in a luxury Chicago hotel room, police said.
Cook County court records show that arrest warrants were issued Monday for involuntary manslaughter without bail for Wintham Latham, 42, and Andrew Warren, 56, in connection with their alleged involvement in the death of Trenton G. James Cornell-Duranleau.
Cornell-Duranleau, 26, died after suffering multiple stab wounds, according to the documents.
A warning issued by the Chicago Police Department says the body was found on July 27.
The police received a call and arrived at the Grand Plaza apartment complex and found the victim with several wounds on his body.
Cornell-Duranleau was pronounced dead at the scene, officials said, and detectives are now investigating the stabbing death as a homicide, while police are actively searching for two suspects.
Latham has been an associate professor of microbiology and immunology at Northwestern University since 2007.
Alan K. Kabbaj, the university's vice president of communications, said in an e-mailed statement that Latham is on administrative leave and barred from Northwestern University campuses.
"This is now a criminal matter that is being investigated by the appropriate authorities, and Northwestern University is cooperating with the investigation," Kabbaj said.
Warren is a senior fellow in finance at Oxford University.
A spokesman for the university and Somerville College said in an email statement: "We have been in contact with UK police and stand ready to provide any necessary assistance to US investigators."
The statement also said Warren's colleagues are in shock and want him to give up.
Chicago Police Department Communications Chief Anthony Guglielmi said he strongly advised the suspects to turn themselves in.
"Police have suspicions about their whereabouts, but our efforts to find them are intensifying," Guglielmi said.
Guglielmi said local, state and federal authorities are helping search for the suspects.
According to Guglielmi, the police received a call from the administrator of the Grand Plaza building, who had just received a mysterious message that something had happened in room 1008.
Police called the crime scene horrific.
Guglielmi said it was unclear whether the July 27 incident itself occurred.
He said CCTV evidence confirmed that Latham and Warren were in the building.
"We believe Professor Latham and the victim had a relationship," Guglielmi said.
Grand Plaza officials issued an appeal to residents, saying: "Police are currently working on a timeline of the incident, gathering information about the victim and considering a number of motives, including a possible domestic incident."
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Mutko: "We will fulfill the requirements of the WADA roadmap in the near future"
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko has said that the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) conditions set for the resumption of the work of the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA) will be met in the near future.
"A certain stage of compliance has been reached and RUSADA has been granted the right to plan and carry out the tests in conjunction with UKAD (UK Anti-Doping Agency).
The WADA roadmap has been updated accordingly, "Mutko said on Thursday.
The Prime Minister commented on the second part of the WADA roadmap to reinstate compliance with the Code, which lists the conditions for the resumption of RUSADA operations and was recently published on the organization's website.
According to Mutko, it contains nothing that would present difficulties for Russia.
"Everything has been announced, everything will be done.
And the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and WADA in the near future, "he added.
However, one of the requirements included in the list implies that Russian anti-doping authorities should publicly accept the results of a WADA-commissioned investigation by Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren, which alleged that doping in Russian sport was state-controlled.
Addressing the issue, Mutko said: 'We are investigating because our anti-doping system has failed.
All measures have been taken.
But there were no state programs, and we will not recognize what did not exist. "
Mutko echoed the words of Vitaly Smirnov, head of Russia's independent public anti-doping commission.
On the morning of the same day, in an interview with the Russian publication Rsport, Smirnov acknowledged previous problems in Russian anti-doping structures, but added: "We have repeatedly said that the report contains certain controversial positions and provisions.
Unconditionally, no one is going to accept this report, "Smirnov added.
WADA suspended RUSADA from doping control in November 2015 following a doping scandal.
But in June this year he was allowed to plan and coordinate testing under the supervision of international experts and the UK Anti-Doping Agency (UKAD).
After visiting the organization's Moscow office in July, WADA Director General Olivier Niggli said RUSADA was "moving in the right direction" toward reinstating its operations.
Fire engulfs 79-storey tower in Dubai
A major fire that occurred in one of the world's tallest residential buildings, The Torch Tower, has been extinguished, Reuters reports.
It is noted that firefighters managed to control all the fires by 4: 00 local time (3: 00 MSK).
Local authorities said no one was injured in the incident.
Streets adjacent to the skyscraper were closed while the fire was extinguished.
The reasons for what happened are not yet known.
Earlier it was reported that the 79-storey residential skyscraper The Torch, which is one of the tallest buildings in the world, is on fire in Dubai.
All residents were evacuated in time.
Buzova's incredible outfit shocked fans: pants that don't cover her knickers
Scandal host of the reality show "House-2" Olga Buzova surprised the audience of the Europa Plus Live festival with a dance in her underpants.
In front of thousands of fans, the newly-minted singer performed a duet with Nastya Kudri called "We're going to be hot."
Both girls took to the stage in provocative "trousers," sewn to reveal the singer's underwear.
The trousers bore the inscriptions Buzova and Kudry.
Earlier, it was reported that a specialist from one of Moscow's plastic surgery clinics commented on the changes in Buzova's appearance.
Stoltenberg admits deteriorating relations between NATO and Russia
This was reported on Friday, 4 August, by Radio 4 "s news service, with reference to foreign media.
According to him, the Russian authorities are responsible for the deterioration of relations between the West and Russia.
In an interview with CNN, the NATO Secretary General also criticized Russia for the situation in Crimea and "destabilization in eastern Ukraine."
At the same time, Stoltenberg assured that dialogue with Russia is nonetheless possible, and further escalation of the situation will not benefit any of its participants.
Earlier on Thursday, US President Donald Trump said relations between the US and Russia were at a dangerously low point, blaming the US Congress.
Yekaterinburg Metro is mastering a new method of payment
In October, it will be possible to pay for travel in the Yekaterinburg subway with a bank card, said Pavel Vedernikov, General Director of OAO I-SET, in an interview with the Regional Newspaper.
Our goal is to introduce the same subway fare system for the 2018 FIFA World Cup as in other major cities: Moscow, St. Petersburg, Nizhny Novgorod and Novosibirsk.
"We want fans from other countries, guests of the World Cup, to be able to use the subway with their bank cards, without purchasing tokens or standing in line," he said.
The startups that will help your company not become the next Uber
Amy Errett wanted to gauge the level of satisfaction among her e-commerce startup's employees, but the surveys didn't work.
Answers were often vague, useless, or, worse, insincere.
And even though she promised anonymity, some staff members distrusted the process.
"He was never consistent or objective," said Errett, who runs San Francisco-based Madison Reed, an e-commerce company in the field of hair care.
So she turned to third parties for help.
Now a new kind of HR startup is emerging to help companies figure out how their employees are feeling.
By developing and licensing software designed to measure employee engagement, they allow companies to conduct rapid surveys, address specific teams and demographic groups, offer employees anonymity and hotlines for complaints, and, in some cases, allow informants to bypass top management and contact management directly.
"Now we have tools like Strava and Fitbit to monitor health, but where is Fitbit for your company?" said Jim Barnett, co-founder and president of startup Glint in Redwood City, whose analytics software companies use to measure employee engagement.
Errett said she gained a better understanding of what her employees thought and felt during her three years using Glint.
In addition to express surveys and questionnaires from certain teams, the product offers a heat map of the company and visualizes which departments have the most complaints and which managers have low approval ratings, which allows the company to understand why.
Companies are slowly realizing that they need to control the workplace, or else they will become just another Uber that was implicated in the scandal when a former employee posted a blog post describing an aggressive environment in which those who complained were punished.
For startups like Glint, this desire for control is an opportunity for profitable business.
The financial technology portal Let's Talk About Payment estimates that the global governance, regulation, and compliance industry could be worth more than $118.7 billion by 2020.
A Denver, Colorado-based startup called Convercent, which helps companies prevent and detect bad behavior, saw a small increase in interest and activity earlier this year amid Uber's declining reputation.
Convercent has nearly 600 customers, including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
Uber recently appeared among its customers.
Like Glint, Convercent allows companies to send customized surveys of staff opinions, collect confidential responses in real time, and view heat maps of problem areas.
It also provides an anonymous text-messaging hotline that allows employees to report bad behavior.
And if a top manager is affected, the complaints go directly to the directorate.
"The court of public opinion has seized power from the inspectors," said Patrick Quinlan, Convercent's founder and president.
If a company is found to be mistreating employees or behaving unethically, even if inspectors do not intervene, the company could face costly consequences in the form of customer boycotts, employee departures, and lawsuits, Quinlan said.
"Ruby Tuesday," a restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees in 500 locations, has used "Convercent" for more than a year to ensure that employees are aware of rules and procedures, and to offer an easy way to contact the company's head office.
Previously, if an employee wanted to report a problem, he or she had to search for a phone number or email address for the head office, file a formal complaint, and hope that it would be taken seriously.
It was often a frightening and embarrassing experience, said James Vitrano, the head of legal affairs at Ruby Tuesday, who said there was no normal way to track employees "complaints.
Now that the company is using Convercent, problems that used to be hidden from managers in offices in other cities or states - such as discrimination, harassment, and unfair pay - can be detected and addressed more quickly.
"I can get closer to a holistic, comprehensive understanding of the situation of employees," said Vitrano, who heads the network's risk management group, Ruby Tuesday.
"And we protect our shareholders from litigation with employees."
According to Quinland, companies began to take employee ethics, values, and engagement more seriously in 2002, after the accounting firm Arthur Andersen collapsed for ethical violations in the wake of the Enron affair.
But it was only when "social media went viral" that companies realized that they could not keep their dirty laundry from going viral online.
"Before we started using technology to monitor ethics, people used hope as a strategy," he said.
Both Glint and Convercent offer their software as a service, charging companies regular fees for the use of their products.
It is a business model and an opportunity that has won the approval of venture investors, who have backed both startups.
In February, Convercent received $10 million in financing from firms such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, bringing its total capital to $47 million.
Glint received $10 million in November from Bessemer Venture Partners, bringing the company's total capital to $60 million.
These investments are hardly surprising, given the interconnected nature of companies, culture, and venture capital.
A growing body of research shows that today's employees expect more from their jobs than they did before.
In highly competitive markets such as Silicon Valley, high wages and interesting projects are just the minimum.
Employees want to feel accepted and valued, and to dedicate their time to a company with a positive mission.
"When people are happy to work for a company, feel that they are being heard, and that the work they do is paying off, they try harder to make it a success," said Nina McQueen, vice president of global employee benefits and satisfaction at LinkedIn, which uses both Convercent and Glint.
Investors make money when companies in their portfolio are doing well; companies are doing well when employees are committed and engaged.
If third-party analytical tools promise to increase employee loyalty and engagement, it is not surprising that they find support.
As workplace culture experts argue, it is important to have data on employee engagement.
But the data are useless until the company's trustees take action.
In fact, if a company asks employees for feedback, it can give the impression that change is coming.
And if change does not come quickly enough, or if it does not come at all, frustration can develop and employees lose interest.
"If you're going to ask for 4,000 proposals, you have to be willing to have 4,000 conversations," said Russell Rath, president of consulting at management firm Kotter International, who has seen companies make the mistake of relying too heavily on data collection.
"Because if you don't go all the way, the staff will be like," Did you hear me?
Don't you care?
And if you don't care, why shouldn't I care? "
Errett said Madison Reed, which now conducts monthly employee surveys, is able to take action on the same day that someone reports a problem with Glint.
And, after collecting feedback from employees dissatisfied with the speed of decision-making and the quality of communication, she was able to reorganize several teams within the company and introduce communication training to solve problems.
Ruby Tuesday is gaining new knowledge about its employees and hopes that in the long term, this knowledge will help it retain employees more effectively in an industry known for high turnover.
"If you're not trying to create a culture of transparency, you're going to lose people," Vitrano said.
If you lose people, you lose customers.
And if you lose customers, you lose companies.
In Barnaul, a new asphalt on Krasnoarmeiskoye Avenue is being opened
In Barnaul, cardinal measures were taken to eliminate the cause of the asphalt sinkholes on Krasnoarmeiskoye Avenue.
It has been decided to "open" the place where the holes on the recently paved carriageway (intersection with Molodezhnaya Street) have arisen twice.
Recall that the collapse of a small section of the road near the tram tracks was due to the fact that the land in the area of the ownerless unexploited network had sunk.
According to Ivan Garmat, Deputy Chairman of the City Committee for Roads, Improvement, Transport and Communications, a detailed survey will be conducted to examine in detail and eliminate the prerequisites for the collapse.
Depending on the outcome, the necessary measures will be taken.
It is expected that the formwork of the ownerless communications will need to be repaired and concreted.
This is reported on the official website of the regional capital.
Bruins team has to practice longer after National Student Sports Association cancels twice-a-day workouts
Time is approaching eleven o'clock; a crowd of players from the University of California at Los Angeles lingers to chat on one side of the team's new training fields located on campus.
Some pulled up their T-shirts, exposing their backs, glistening with sweat after a tense first day of training camp.
For many of the team's players, these moments of idleness constitute a mid-day break.
After a three-hour training session, the players will head back to their dormitories to prepare for the final exams, and return to Wasserman's football center the next morning for meetings at 6: 30 a.m.
Shortly before Monday turned into Tuesday, Bruins coach Jim Mora said, "These guys are going to have a meat grinder for the next three days."
The fact that the National Student Sports Association canceled training twice a day, which was designed to reduce the workload for players, actually lengthened their workday - at least until the end of Friday's exams.
So the first three practices of the University of California, Los Angeles team were scheduled to start at 7: 15 p.m. to fit into the players "already busy schedule.
A side effect of not having two workouts a day is more days with one workout, and the Bruins are moving the start of camp by nearly a week from last year and training during summer school for the first time in Mora's six seasons at Westwood.
They are scheduled to hold 18 practices through August 20 before starting formal preparations for their first game of the season against a Texas A & M University team in September.
Mora said he supports a rule change by the National Student Sports Association, even though it adds another item to the tight player schedule.
"For three or four days we give them this huge load, it's a big test," Mora said.
"And they just got over it, they're working, they're great guys.
I think when we get to Saturday and have more time, it's going to be really cool. '
When the camp ends, the University of California at Los Angeles will make workouts closed; no easy task, as its fields are in direct view from the adjacent parking lot and from the nearby Laskin Center, an expensive hotel that has already been bombarded with footballs that have crossed the protective net behind the goal.
Bruins players must occupy a hotel starting this weekend, but Mora admits that when rooms are available during the season, there could be a problem.
"We will have security," Mora said.
'This is a serious problem and I'm not exaggerating the danger by suggesting that someone can rent a room, sit there and video the training.
If you have a video of a training session, it's very serious.
But we will have security there and there will be security at car park number 8.
We will do everything we can with what we have.
I won't worry too much about it.
We have a plan. "
All victims of the terrorist attack in St. Petersburg have been released from hospitals
All those injured in the terrorist attack on the St. Petersburg subway in April have been released from hospitals.
This was reported by the press service of Vice Governor Anna Mityanina.
As of the end of July, three people remained in hospital, "TV Center" reports.
Recall that the explosion in the subway of St. Petersburg occurred on April 3 of this year.
The bomb was detonated by a suicide bomber, Akbarjon Jalilov.
As a result of the attack, 15 people were killed, as well as the perpetrator himself.
Eleven people, including the alleged organizer, Abror Azimov, have been arrested in the criminal case.
Recall that on the eve of Rospotrebnadzor recommended that the St. Petersburg Metro revise its action plan to ensure transport security, in particular, by increasing the number of metal detector frames.
Facebook steps up fact-checking in fight against fake news
Facebook will increasingly send texts suspected of hoaxes to independent experts and display their findings under original posts, the world's largest social network said Thursday as it tries to combat so-called fake news.
In a statement on its website, the company said it is beginning to use improved machine-learning algorithms to detect possible hoaxes, send them for testing, and possibly display the results of fact-checking under the original post.
Facebook has been criticized as one of the main sources of so-called fake news, which many believe influenced the 2016 US presidential election.
The issue has also been the subject of intense debate in Europe, after French voters were misled by false reports ahead of May's presidential election, and in Germany ahead of September's election declared support for a plan to fine social media if they do not promptly remove hate posts.
In a separate statement in German on Thursday, Facebook said it was testing a new fact-checking algorithm that has been launched in the US, France, the Netherlands and Germany.
"In addition to seeing which posts are challenged by independent reviewers, people want a broader context to make informed judgments about what they are reading and sharing," Sarah Sue, Facebook's News Feed Manager, wrote in her blog.
She added that Facebook would continue to test the "linked articles" feature and work on other changes to the news feed to address the problem of fake news.
Create a comic novel: One castle in English history
In the recent past, the tiny Scotney Castle was featured in the music video "Squeeze," and in the 1970 "s and 1980" s served as a refuge for Margaret Thatcher.
But 700 years on from his cozy spot in the River Beul valley in Kent, he has observed the tumultuous history around him, and has now inspired Jamie Rhodes, a Yorkshireman with a mop of hair and a penchant for historical documents, to write a comic novel.
"I think it's so beautiful to look at the handwriting of a man who died 300 years ago," he says enthusiastically.
"You feel it so personally when you hold this letter in your hand."
"Castle in England" covers the period from the Middle Ages to the Edwardian era and tells the story of families who lived in Scotney; each story was illustrated by one of the young British artists - Isaac Lenkiewicz, Bryony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer and Isabel Greenberg.
This is not Rhodes's first book to be based on archival data: in 2014, he wrote Dead Man's Teeth and Other Stories, a collection of British Library documents that moved him unexpectedly to his heart.
"I could be moved by just a fingerprint on the edge of a letter written in the 1700s by a double agent working for the Jacobites," he says.
"It's his fingerprint"
And letters always smell of smoke, because in those days a fire was lit to illuminate.
And 300 years from now, in the future, you think you're there, too.
Oh, how I love archives! "
For someone so passionate about old papers, getting support from the National Trust and the Arts Council of England and living in a castle for four months ("Honestly, I've stayed there a little bit") seems too good to be true.
Rhodes spent days exploring the "new" Victorian castle, browsing the archives and examining the estate's many treasures and antiquities - for example, the heads of hyenas on the walls or bottles that had lain in the moat for centuries.
He walked in the park and through the ruins of the old castle, talking to forest rangers, gardeners, and sometimes artists working on illustrations for his book.
Then, at night, he would "drink whiskey and sit down to write."
The history of Scotney Castle is not well understood, because the National Trust only gained full access to it in 2006, when the last heiress, Elizabeth Hussey, died.
When Rhodes arrived a decade later, staff were just beginning to sort through the archive, which he describes as "what the aristocrats had piled up in the attic for centuries."
Diaries, letters from the British Empire, maps showing who owned what: "You think land disputes are boring," says Rhodes, "but this birch was fought over by two families.
It happens, guys! "
In some of the stories in the collection, the castle becomes the starting point for wider research in English history: for example, in The Worker, the hero leaves the newly built castle to join the Peasant Revolution of 1381.
"There is evidence of a riot at the castle in 1380 in a book called The Knighthoods of Kent and Sussex," says Rhodes.
"The peasant revolt began in these places, and I thought that it was the right place to start.
Maybe they were related? "
Other stories are strongly linked to the history of the castle - for example, "The Priest," which tells the story of a Jesuit priest whom the Durrells family hid in their home for seven years during the English Reformation.
Or "The Smuggler," about the 18th-century smuggler Arthur Darrel, who is believed to have staged his own funeral by stoning the coffin (this was discovered a few years later when the coffin was dug up).
The Durrells are the loved-up Rhodes family of all who inhabited the Scotstoun: "The gentlemen seem to have been a perfect scam, forever getting into debt and spending money on things they couldn't afford.
In different generations, the male Durrells solved their debt problems by marrying rich older women - I think of them as the company of nice guys who know how to look after heiresses of big fortunes. "
After finishing his job at the castle, Rhodes is looking for other opportunities to gain a unique writing experience.
He lived for two weeks in the Finnish wilderness, where he wrote a graphic novel about Elämäki, a place where there was a health resort at the beginning of the twentieth century, and then it was overgrown with forest again.
But Scotney remains a special place for him.
"I was sad to leave," he says.
'I was like, "Damn, I've got to get back into real life."
Fifteen Largest Banks Choose "Russia"
The conflict in the Association of Russian Banks (ARB) is developing: after Sberbank, VTB, VTB-24, Alfa-Bank, Gazprombank, Rosselkhozbank, Binbank and FC Otkritie, another seven credit institutions are about to leave this public organization.
Thus, organizations that have withdrawn from the ARB will have at least 80 percent of the market.
But it is not just a way out - all banks that have announced a break with the ARB are negotiating with another public organization uniting credit institutions, the Association of Regional Banks "Rossiya," headed by a well-known politician, Anatoly Aksakov, Chairman of the State Duma Committee on Financial Market, who was recognized, by the way, following the results of the last session and the most effective head of the Duma Committee and deputy in terms of the number of draft laws prepared.
The conflict within the ARB began during a discussion in the Federation Council, when the Interregional Banking Council was considering new draft laws, including a new classification of banks according to the size of the authorized capital.
At that time, Garegin Tosunyan, President of ARB, stated that, in the opinion of the Association, this bill is adopted in the interest of the largest banks, which thus try to limit the opportunities of small and medium-sized banks in the regions by intercepting their customers.
Among other complaints, there was also criticism of the Central Bank, which, according to Tosunyan, is not always justifiably revoking the licenses of some banks, to which, however, there was an objection from a representative of the Central Bank: many of the heads of the past banks, particularly Vneshprombank, were members of the governing bodies of the ARB.
Apparently, this exchange of mutually exclusive opinions in a highly sensitive banking environment to relations with the main regulator became a visible reason for the fifteen largest banks, having stated their disagreement with the ARB's policy, to begin preparing to join the Rossiya association, noting that "the effectiveness of the ARB's work is at a low level, and a constructive dialogue within the banking community is not actually being conducted."
Depositors will be better off
Where will it end?
Let us immediately answer the main question, which arises in the event of the slightest disruption or conflict in the banking sector or near it: depositors are not threatened by anything; rather, on the contrary, the reliability of the banking system will be improved.
The head of Rossiya, Anatoly Aksakov, is a high-level professional who is highly regarded in the Central Bank: practically all the Central Bank's management is present at the association's annual events, and all significant legislative initiatives of the regulator pass through expert assessments by the "regions."
In terms of personnel and organization, it is also clear that there will be no major upheaval.
To be sure, ARB finds itself in a difficult financial-management situation after losing such powerful and influential participants with their contributions and lobbying capabilities.
But in this oldest - established in 1991 - organization for the interests of the banking community, there is considerable potential to continue to improve banking legislation and monetary policy in general.
It cannot be said that the Rossiya Association is ready to accept new members under any conditions, judging by the reaction of its head, Anatoly Aksakov ("maybe they will want too much"), who stated on July 21, at a briefing in the press center of the Parliamentary Newspaper, that "literally the next day, representatives of banks that have withdrawn from the ARB asked me to consider the possibility of increasing the potential of our Rossiya Association."
Their proposals are to strengthen bankers "voices on the Association Board, and to pay more attention to new banking technologies.
Negotiations are underway, proposals from both sides are being studied, and the agenda for the Association's extraordinary congress, which will be held in Sochi in mid-September as part of an international banking forum, is being prepared.
That's where we'll find out.
Also, Anatoly Aksakov, stressing that "he is not holding on to his seat," named Georgy Luntovsky, who is leaving in September as Deputy Chairman of the Central Bank, as a possible new head of the renewed Rossiya Association, highly characterizing his business and human qualities.
On August 18, Anatoly Aksakov, who is currently holidaying in Crimea, plans to interrupt his vacation for one day and arrive in Moscow for an extraordinary meeting of the Council of the Rossiya Association, where the agenda of the extraordinary Rossiya congress is scheduled to be considered.
Entry of gasoline-powered cars into major cities of Russia will not be restricted
Deputy Head of the Ministry of Transport Nikolai Asaul stated that, contrary to media reports, the entry of gasoline-powered cars into major cities of Russia will not be restricted yet.
This is a more radical form of our concept.
Our concept is to gradually raise the ecological class.
And there, the concept goes straight to zero emissions.
I believe that we are not technically ready for this.
The question is: since what year?
It is a slogan-level phrase - let's ban it.
Where and when?
Tomorrow?
Shall we close the whole city?
"In 20 years, I don't know if it will happen," Prime quotes the minister as saying.
Earlier, Izvestia newspaper reported that by 17 August, Deputy Prime Minister Arkady Dvorkovich was instructed to study the proposals on possible options for state support of electric transport submitted to the government by General Director of PJSC KamAZ Sergei Kogogin.
Among the proposals, according to the newspaper, is the use of machines with internal combustion engines in major cities and resorts.
Washington is changing the rules for getting a green card.
According to media reports, President Donald Trump has said that a new US immigration plan will be adopted, which will change the rules for obtaining a green card.
The plan calls for a reduction in the number of legal immigrants to 50,000 per year, stricter rules for obtaining temporary work visas, and restrictions on obtaining family visas.
The new rules are proposed by the Republican Party and supported by the president.
The bill will be debated in both houses of Congress.
"This legislation will reduce poverty, raise wages, and save taxpayers billions of dollars, and it will do so by changing how the US issues green cards to citizens of other countries.
The law would reduce chain migration and replace the existing scheme.
The new application process will benefit candidates who speak English, have the financial resources to support themselves, and have the skills that will benefit our economy, "Trump said, according to US media.
The advent of sex robots is real, and that should worry us
No sooner had we thought that 2017 could not get any worse, a new report on technological advances in sex robots has come out.
Mda.
Sex robots are now in the spotlight.
The Foundation for Responsible Robotics (FRR) recently released a report on the development of sex robots over the next 5-10 years.
According to Noel Sharkey, emeritus professor of robotics and artificial intelligence at the University of Sheffield and co-founder of FRR, we should take their emergence seriously.
Users will be able to choose the color of the robot's eyes, the shape of its nipples and the type of its nails.
"People giggle about it, but firms are already shipping a lot of them to consumers, and soon we will see a lot more of them," Sharkey said at the launch of the new report.
Modern sex dolls have evolved from their inflatable counterparts into robots with silicone skin that is warm to the touch, and with near-human replicas controlled by artificial intelligence.
Users can also "customize" their robots to their liking, choosing everything from the color of their eyes and the shape of their nipples to the shape and color of their nails.
But the fact that many robots have a "personality," compared to which the Stepford Wife would appear to be very progressive, is even more troubling.
Modern sex dolls have evolved into silicone-skinned robots.
For example, RealBotix robots allow users to customize in robots the qualities they find attractive - such as shyness.
Then there are Roxxxy Gold sex robots, developed by True Companion, which come with a pre-programmed personality - for example, "Cold Farrah" seems shy, and "Wild Wendy" has a "bold" character.
"Roxxxy Gold has a character that suits you perfectly," the True Companion website enthuses.
So she loves what you love, doesn't love what you don't love, and so on.
She changes her mood during the day like a real person!
She may want to sleep or chat, or she may "be in the mood"! "
There is much to worry about in the advent of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but most worrying is the subordinate image of women, the association with rape that possession of Cold (read: resisting) Hare triggers.
The True Companion website compares Roxxxy to a vibrator, only for men.
"If a woman (sic!) can have a vibrator, why can't men have Roxxxy?" the website says.
But these sex robots are not just fetishes or just new sex toys.
Their emergence and increasing complexity point to something darker and deeper in our culture, a retreat from the ideal of gender equality to a desire for sex with submission as an optional supplement.
Most men, of course, will not buy sex robots, and while FRR notes their growing popularity, they remain on the periphery of consumer culture.
But what comes to us from the periphery can be instructive about the meaning of the era in which we live.
And many people are neither evil nor aggressive until the free market gives them the opportunity to do so.
It is no coincidence that these sophisticated sex robots have emerged at a time when women's rights around the world are under threat, with a president in the White House boasting about molesting women.
The scariest thing about The Handmaid's Tale is not the graphics, the twisted bodies, and the squashed eyes, but how realistic the vision seems.
The Republic of Gilead is an exaggeration, but it does not seem so great now.
The goal of the sex robot industry is to achieve the physical likeness of real women (with porn star proportions only) that technology allows.
Their creators want them to seem human to the touch, to mimic the movements of the human body.
But it is precisely because of their "characters" that robots do not resemble real women.
They cannot break with their partners or walk away from them.
They have neither their lives nor their biographies - nothing to indicate independence or anything else to break the illusion of total dependence.
In other words, they are beautiful slaves.
Or, as they say in 2017, handmaids.
Los Angeles native Eugene (Pooh) Jeter, who has been playing for the Ukrainian national team since 2013, will not help our national team in the European Basketball Championship, the final part of which starts on August 31.
This was reported by Andrey Lebedev, General Manager of Blue-Yellow, in an interview with BeBasket portal.
We tried to negotiate with Jeter, but unfortunately he won't come for family reasons.
We will go to Eurobasket without a naturalized player, because we don't want to take someone we don't know.
"This situation will provide opportunities for the development of our young players," he said.
Let me remind you: with Jeter's direct participation, the Ukrainian team took a record sixth place at Eurobasketball 2013 and for the first time got to the World Basketball Championship, where the "yellow-blue" could not overcome the group stage, and the native of the United States scored an average of 15.4 points per game, made 3 rebounds and gave 5 assists.
Jeter has not played for the Ukrainian team since American Mike Fratello left as head coach of our national team in 2015.
Men's Eurobasket 2017 will be held simultaneously in four countries: Turkey, Romania, Israel and Finland.
The Ukrainian team will hold its group tournament matches in the Promised Land.
Evgeny Murzin's men will have five matches in Group B: against Germany (31 August), Italy (2 September), Georgia (3), Lithuania (5) and Israel (6).
In preparation for the tournament, our men's national team held two control matches, in which it lost to the Dutch and Belarusians.
Trump's great feat?
To portray Mitt Romney seems very reasonable
In the Trump era, a common thread has been the fact that the political disputes that have polarized the American electorate have micromanaged some families.
Between Thanksgiving and Christmas, American newspapers ran columns about how to deal with the terrible relatives who voted for Trump.
We all seem to be so stressed that we're going to burst.
Less has been said about Trump's ability to unite families.
I write this because my cousin, a left-leaning poet from Chicago who has long been at odds with the Republicans in her family, came to see me in New York this week.
It reminded me that uniting against a common enemy can have a powerful effect.
With Trump in the White House, everyone she knows, including the Republican brother with whom she has argued about politics for decades, suddenly and strangely found themselves on the same side.
At dinner, that is certainly a good thing; but I can't help thinking that, in a broader context, it could be quite dangerous.
Trump has galvanized the left, but the distorting effect of his rule could shift us all to the right.
When we speak of Trump and "normalization," we mean the unlikely possibility that one day we will stop being struck by his antics.
There is, however, an even more dubious scenario in which Trump "normalizes" the most right-wing Republicans, who, by his standards, suddenly appear to be a paragon of common sense.
I found myself missing Mitt Romney's old-fashioned madness today - with a dog on the roof of a car and a 14 percent income tax rate (but at least we knew what his tax returns looked like) - compared to Trump, both seem very minor evils.
When Trump leaves, the next Republican nominee will need only be in his mind to be seen as a huge step forward.
When my cousin went to the center, we went with the kids to a carousel in Central Park - the largest carousel in the New York City Department of Parks and the best way in town to spend three dollars if you don't need caffeine.
The horses are formidable and huge, the images of fiberglass on the central drum - grimacing clowns and animals looking at their backs in horror - are extremely sinister, and the jangling music, oddly enough, enthuses.
So many famous things about this city are disappointing: the views from skyscrapers are obsolete, the silhouettes of buildings are too tired to be awe-inspiring, and the reality of the city has not kept pace with the dream.
Thirty-five years on, and I still relive the day I learned that Swiss Cottage is not really a Swiss chalet (the Ye Olde Swiss Cottage theme pub doesn't count), but a large roundabout in North London.
And the merry-go-round in Central Park is still an unusual, magical place where a two-year-old child, an eleven-year-old child, and two women in their forties can have a great time.
If I could put a score on the merry-go-round, I would put a five, but luckily no one asked me to do it.
At a department store this week, I was asked to rate my shopping "experience" on a scale of one to five stars before going through the terminal.
At the coffee shop on the corner of my street, it's the same, plus the option of a 15 per cent tip - that's for ordering at the counter.
This not only slows down supposedly neutral interaction, but also forces personal engagement in a situation that does not involve it.
The poor shop assistant in the department store smiled smugly as I wearily rated her credit card experience at five stars.
Oscar Pistorius moved from prison to hospital due to chest pain
It is the second time that Pistorius has left prison for a visit to a doctor.
Last year, he was transferred to a hospital to receive treatment for cuts to his wrists that prison officials said he suffered as a result of falling in his cell.
Pistorius was convicted of premeditated murder following an appeal by prosecutors against his original manslaughter conviction.
He killed Steenkamp in the early hours of Valentine's Day in 2013, shooting her multiple times through a toilet door in his Pretoria home.
Pistorius said he mistook his girlfriend for an overnight thief hiding in his toilet.
Prosecutors have announced their intention to file another appeal, this time against Pretorius' six-year sentence, which they say is too lenient.
The Attorney General's Office has said it will appeal to the Supreme Court of South Africa and an appeal will be heard this year.
Praetorium's sentence could be extended by 15 years if prosecutors succeed.
South Africa does not have the death penalty.
Suspect in beating of NTV journalist given travel ban
Law enforcement officials in the capital chose a preventive measure in the form of a travel ban for a man who attacked Nikita Razvozzhaev, a journalist for the NTV channel, during a live broadcast from Gorky Park on August 2.
This was reported by TASS with reference to the official representative of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Russian Federation, Irina Volk.
"As part of the investigation of a criminal case initiated under Article 116 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation (" Battering ") against a 32-year-old man who hit a correspondent of one of the TV channels in Gorky Central Park of Culture and Recreation, the suspect was selected as a preventive measure in the form of a travel ban and proper behavior," Wolf clarified.
An Interior Ministry spokeswoman added that an administrative report had been drawn up against the suspect for disobeying police.
On Wednesday, 2 August, during a live broadcast for Airborne Forces Day, the correspondent was approached by a drunk man and punched in the face.
As it turned out later, the bully had nothing to do with the Airborne.
According to Razvozzhaev himself, the paratroopers, on the contrary, tried to detain the Muscovite.
Two Bulgarian Citizens Arrested in Greece for Illegal Tent Parking
According to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, two Bulgarian citizens were detained in Greece for illegal camping.
On the morning of 1 August, a group of people, including two Bulgarian citizens, were detained in Sithonia after setting up tents in the wrong place.
They were released the same day, while the investigation is ongoing.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs told the BBC that the Bulgarian citizens had since been released.
Greek authorities have tightened controls on free camping and are already imposing heavy fines on anyone caught parking in an unauthorized place.
Checks will be carried out throughout the season.
According to the ministry, the court can impose a fine.
Russia's MFA accuses US vice president of Cold War-era rhetoric
Statements made during US Vice President Michael Pence's European tour have been criticized by the Russian Foreign Ministry.
"It is with regret that we have to state that Washington is sliding deeper and deeper into primitive Cold War-era ideological clichés that are completely divorced from reality," the Russian Foreign Ministry said in a statement.
This is how the Foreign Ministry reacted to Pence's remarks in Podgorica about the "Russian threat" and attempts to forcibly redraw borders.
The Russian Foreign Ministry pointed out the destructive nature of the choice "either with the West or with Russia" and the lack of obvious thesis about the supposedly unopposed entry of all of Southeast Europe into NATO.
Russian diplomats also recalled that it was the US that violated international law by using force to secede Kosovo from Serbia and thus created another hotbed of tension.
"We call on our American colleagues to stop slandering Russia and its foreign policy line, which is always based on respect for partners and readiness for joint constructive work, on mutual consideration of interests," the statement from the Russian Foreign Ministry reads.
A paramedic was injured in an accident with an ambulance in the Moscow region
The accident occurred in Stupino, near Moscow, and a paramedic was injured as a result of a collision between a foreign car and an ambulance.
Today, at about 08: 10 MSK, a Mitsubishi car collided with an ambulance in the city of Stupino, Moscow Region.
"As a result of the collision, the ambulance overturned," the press service of the Moscow Region Department of the Ministry of Internal Affairs told TASS.
Law enforcement officers are working at the scene of the accident, the circumstances of what happened are being worked out.
In Odessa Oblast, a woman threw away her newborn son on a construction site, wrapped in a cellophane bag.
On the evening of 3 August, the Razdelnyansky Police Department received a report from a local resident that he had found a package containing a baby in an unfinished private house.
"Law enforcement officers and doctors arrived at the scene of the incident and promptly took the child to a medical institution," the Odessa headquarters of the National Police reported.
Medics determined that the boy was born a few hours before his discovery, as evidenced by the presence of an umbilical cord.
In the course of priority operational and investigative measures, the identity of the woman giving birth - a 36-year-old local resident - has been established.
It has also been established that the woman has three other young children.
According to the head office, the family had not previously come into the sight of law enforcement officers and was not on a special register.
Police are currently investigating the circumstances and reasons that led the woman to the act, after which a procedural decision will be made.
The baby is now under the care of doctors.
As previously reported, in Nikolaev, a 21-year-old woman threw her premature baby into a garbage pipe.
Grigory Leps: "I rush into battle, though 55 is not 30"
One of the most successful artists of Russian pop music, Grigory Leps, will celebrate his 55th birthday next Sunday.
Before the celebration, the singer talked to an Izvestia columnist.
I remember how your "poltinnik" was celebrated.
A special tent in the Luzhniki, Gloria Gaynor sang for the birthday boy, a powerful fireworks display over the Moscow River.
You must have guessed then how you would like to spend your next five-year plan.
Did the plans come true?
As far as the profession is concerned, it was a good period.
I worked hard, toured the whole country three times, gave 120-130 concerts a year.
He released two good albums.
Of course, I am not what I was, say, 20 years ago.
Biological clocks are not fooled.
Singing the way I sang in my 30s is getting harder.
Nevertheless, I rush into battle, I don't want to stop.
And I'm with new people, it seems to me, I'm taking it to another level.
You're recording a new album with them, the first in three years.
Yes, it is being worked on.
In fact, we've already recorded everything in my studio and will now send it to Los Angeles for compilation.
It is called "Why are you so serious?," based on the song of the same name, which was co-written with Timati.
It's not quite ready yet, so we haven't put it out there yet.
Let's do it later, when we shoot the video for it.
And we will present the album in November - for a series of my jubilee concerts in Moscow's Crocus City Hall.
Chris Coleman, the cool American drummer, has put his hand up for your new record.
Do you think you wanted him in your touring line-up?
In my opinion, Coleman is one of the most outstanding drummers in the world today.
He would come to my studio and record his parts.
I invited him to join my band, and Jeremy Colson (a well-known drummer involved in various projects. - Izvestia) suggested.
But they imposed excessive conditions, to put it mildly, for a long period of work in Russia.
The fees ranged from €35,000 to €45,000 per month.
At that time, I thought that I would find worthy musicians in the post-Soviet space as well.
And found a great drummer, Max Malyshev.
In general it is better to feed the own (smiles).
Sometimes I want to get into a fight with one of them, but not for anything.
For example, the guitarist Fedor Dosumov is highly quoted at the international level.
Western music magazines write about him, and he is invited to various guitar festivals.
Steve Wai, listening to him play, said that "a new generation of guitarists, with a different performing technique, has come."
Your album is made in Los Angeles, American musicians cooperate with you, but you still can't come to the United States?
Are you trying to lift the ban?
Right now, to be honest, I'm not doing anything.
There are a number of lawyers who are working on this issue.
As a musician, I am truly sorry that I cannot get to America.
I have said many times that I am studying there.
The more you communicate with real professionals, the more useful it is.
We're not dumber than them, but we don't have that experience, school.
For 70 years, our artists of popular music have not been given the tasks that American musicians have always done.
They aspired to the highest quality sound possible.
And I try to follow the same principles.
Now, for some reason, the UK has refused me entry for ten years.
But I will still apply for a visa every year at the British Embassy, so that I can go there again and, most importantly, work there.
The rest of Europe treats me favorably.
And already in August, you are planning a concert in Monaco, not by order, but as a poster, right?
Yes, in Monte Carlo there is a good gym "Sporting," I have already performed there once.
Now they have been invited again and, as far as I know, all the tickets for the concert have already been sold out.
Will you go to the Rendezvous of Laima Vaikule, which will start on July 20 in Jurmala?
She invited me and I certainly responded.
Lyme is a wonderful singer and a great woman who can present herself with great vocals and even whispers.
After tours and anniversary concerts, as far as I know, once again you want to turn to the work of Vladimir Vysotsky.
You already have two albums of his songs in your discography.
When will the third one come out?
Probably next year.
But it will be done very differently.
I want to record about 80-90 of Vysotsky's songs in about the same way that he did himself.
Only voice and guitar.
No other arrangement.
I will be accompanied by our famous musician Timur Vedernikov.
I will try to involve Alexander Yakovlevich Rosenbaum in the album as well.
I've talked to him about it, we have a good relationship, but he's a busy man, so we'll see how it goes.
You have gradually introduced Boris Grebenschikov's songs into your repertoire.
Maybe then you will record an album of his things?
Boris Borisovich is a wonderful man and a great musician.
I met him several times and asked: can I sing this or that of his song?
He replied: "Gregory, I write songs to be performed."
Please try, sing.
It is probably interesting to record such an album as well.
So far, I have no such task, but in the future, in a year or two, if Boris Borisovich does not object, I may do such a project.
If you don't focus fully on the affairs of your production center.
I suppose, until you have realized its potential, have not signed contracts with all the artists you are interested in?
There are a number of performers that I would like to have under my wing, but they are independent, well-established people.
Do you mean Sergei Lazarev?
Seryozha is a brilliant singer, I invited him.
I may disagree with his repertoire in some respects, but he is a professional and he has his own development strategy.
And in my center now there is Aleksandr Panayotov, whom I led in "The Voice."
We have concluded a contract with him and are working.
In our pop music, such singers are rare.
It will be a real pity if he does not reach the heights he deserves.
I try to pick up his repertoire, I shoot clips.
I hope for a good result.
I also try to promote other artists of my center: I buy them songs, I pay poets, sometimes their tracks get on the rotation of TV and radio channels.
If they do not reach great heights, I will still take our cooperation to its logical conclusion.
On the way out, they will receive a recorded album, a few clips.
And then, if they want to, they can go their own way, and I will not insist that they return the money invested in them.
Although I will be pleased if one of them succeeds commercially and pays me the interest that we negotiated in the contract.
But if that doesn't happen, I'm not going to cut off oxygen to anyone.
Let everyone work, break through, prove, as I once proved.
If tomorrow you are offered a tour of Ukraine and are guaranteed entry into the country, will you go?
I still get invited there.
These are mostly closed events.
As for the Grand Tour...
I am a man of my country, a Russian, of my own accord, who flew to Syria on the same plane that then crashed.
If tomorrow they say that it is necessary to fly to some other place in the interests of the state, I will fly.
And I don't care what bloggers and other critics think of me.
I sincerely regret that this situation happened to Ukraine.
For I believe that we are one people and must be together.
I regret that this is unlikely to happen, at least not anytime soon.
I used to give 40-50 concerts a year in Ukraine.
They met like nowhere else.
A very grateful public.
And he collaborated with several Ukrainian artists: Ani Lorak, Sveta Loboda, Artem Loik...
There are a lot of talented people in Ukraine, and it is a real pity that they cannot now fully spread their talent to a wide Russian audience.
Music should unite and entertain people.
I would be happy to invite some cool Ukrainian performer to Russia, for example Slava Vakarchuk, and make a joint concert with him.
But I think it's unlikely at this point...
Andrei Okhlopkov transferred from the cosmodrome
As Kommersant learned, Andrei Okhlopkov, Technical Director of the Vostochny Cosmodrome, started work at Khrunichev State Space Research and Production Center (SKNPC).
Previously, he was de facto engaged in the construction of the Vostochny Cosmodrome, but due to disagreements with the management of the Centre for the Operation of Ground and Space Infrastructure (CENKI), he was transferred to a facility in Fili, Moscow, where he will coordinate production.
Mr. Okhlopkov will not have a replacement: the post of technical director will most likely be abolished, and the functional functions will be scattered throughout the subdivisions of the ECCI.
Top managers of several space industry enterprises, as well as an employee of the government apparatus, told Kommersant that Andrei Okhlopkov, Technical Director of Vostochny and Deputy General Director of CENKI for Technological Development, had joined Khrunichev State Research and Production Center.
"He has been working in his new position for several weeks," Kommersant industry sources said.
CENKI could not be reached for immediate comment on Thursday, and Mr Okhlopkov was unavailable for comment.
However, Kommersant's information was officially confirmed by SKNPC.
He made a decision to transfer to the post of Director of Production Coordination, the company said. - Andrei Okhlopkov fully fulfilled his task of ensuring the minimum launch time for the first launch at Vostochny Cosmodrome.
Mr. Okhlopkov went to work at CENKI in 2013, having served in the space forces, particularly on Baikonur, and in Plesetsk - at the "northern" cosmodrome - he held the post of First Deputy Commander with the rank of Colonel.
In 2009, Andrei Okhlopkov became a defendant in a criminal case.
The investigation accused him of bribery: allegedly, at his request, regional merchants received state orders for kickbacks, but did not fulfill their obligations to clean up separated parts of launch vehicles in the Arkhangelsk region and the Komi Republic.
In 2012, a jury found him not guilty.
The technological development responsibilities assigned to him at CENKI applied to various projects, but the main one was the construction of a cosmodrome in the Far East.
In an interview with Kommersant, the then head of the Federal Space Agency, Oleg Ostapenko, bluntly said that the situation on Vostochny "was already critical in October 2013."
The fact is that there was a strategic error in the planning: the completion of construction and the first launch of the Soyuz-2.1 launch vehicle were scheduled for the same time - the end of 2015.
In order to carry out the launch before the end of the year, the construction was decided to be completed six months earlier and the schedule was changed from December to July 2015.
In order to speed up the process, a trick had to be used: CENKI specialists began to carry out parallel installation of technological equipment at unfinished facilities.
The main supporter of this idea was Andrei Okhlopkov.
Despite the existing risks and the postponement (instead of December 2015, the Soyuz took off only on April 28, 2016), this idea paid off, says a Kommersant source at the cosmodrome: "Otherwise, we would still not have carried out a single launch from Vostochniy, but would have been engaged in construction."
Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Rogozin, who oversees the creation of the cosmodrome, jokingly referred to Andrei Okhlopkov as his "cosmic Susanin," but it was from him that he almost always requested information about the progress of construction.
Mr. Okhlopkov is also remembered for his bluntness: for example, in an interview with Kommersant, he proposed to deprive the Federal Agency for Special Construction (Spetsstroy) of the status of the only performer for the Eastern region and to work directly with subcontractors: "Why should we put all eggs in one basket of Spetsstroy?"
This idea has found support in the government.
Since 2017, CENKI has assumed the duties of general contractor in order to complete the construction and installation works at the start-up and maintenance complex by the planned launches in the fourth quarter.
According to Kommersant, the reason for Mr. Okhlopkov's transition to a new job was disagreement with the CENKI leadership on how to complete the construction of the facilities and complexes of the cosmodrome, as well as on how to work with subcontractors.
"It was decided that it would be better for everyone," says one of the top managers involved in the construction of Vostochny.
A government official, in turn, calls the decision strange: "He was one of the best specialists, finding an equivalent replacement for him will not be easy."
According to Kommersant, this will not be necessary: the post of technical director of the cosmodrome will be abolished, and its functions will be spread over subdivisions of the ECCI.
In music schools, a program of training in two specialties will be introduced
In the future, students of children's music schools will be able to receive two specialties at the same time.
According to the Deputy Director of the Department of Science and Education of the Ministry of Culture, Svyatoslav Golubenko, it is possible to re-read repetitive subjects to students for this purpose, and the issue of paying for the remaining classes in the second specialty can be resolved with the help of special grants, reports RIA Novosti.
"The Ministry of Culture has taken this issue under control, and we, together with the expert community, will develop a mechanism that will allow us to master two specialties, but at the same time will not contradict the current legislation in the field of education," Golubenko said.
Last Friday, during Vladimir Putin's "Non-Childhood Conversation" with the students of the Sirius Children's Center, student Maria Andreeva said that she had to pay for repetitive subjects in the second specialty at the Moscow Conservatory of Music.
The girl said that she was studying violin and piano and had received awards from competitions in both areas.
The head of state recognized her question as very topical and promised to help.
A 17-year-old Russian man who climbed a wall on a skyscraper has been detained in Mexico
In Mexico, a 17-year-old Russian, Kirill N., who climbed the wall on the roof of a high-rise building, reports the portal El Universal.
The incident occurred in the capital, Mexico City.
The young man, with the help of two unidentified men, climbed over a three-metre fence into the Nestle office complex and climbed one of its towers on his own.
In doing so, he did not use any special equipment, insurance or ropes.
The young man was already on the roof.
Officials from the Ministry of Public Security lowered him to the ground by helicopter.
He was then sent to the National Migration Institute.
They find out whether the young man is in the country legally.
Meanwhile, a video of a young man climbing a high-rise has gone viral online.
Users called the young man a "Spider-Man."
According to the media, such experiments are a hobby for him.
Red meat, dairy products, and chocolate can help ease the GCC.
Red meat and chocolate are considered a nightmare for your digestive tract.
But recent research suggests otherwise: a diet rich in meat proteins and dairy products can help alleviate symptoms in those suffering from inflammatory bowel disease.
The incurable disease, which affects an estimated 1.3 million people in the US and 300,000 in the UK, causes colic and bloating, chronic or bloody diarrhea, weight loss and extreme fatigue.
Normally, to alleviate symptoms, patients are advised to avoid meat and dairy products, but researchers at the University of Washington have found that the main amino acid of the protein tryptophan promotes the production of immune cells that increase gut tolerance.
Lead researcher Dr Marco Colonna explained that immune cells in the gut ensure that harmful microbes from food do not enter the body.
Cells that can trigger the inflammatory process are balanced by cells that increase tolerance while protecting the body without harming sensitive tissues.
If the balance is skewed too much toward inflammation, it can lead to inflammatory bowel disease.
Experiments have shown that mice with certain bacteria in the gut develop tolerance-boosting cells.
And this bacterium needs tryptophan - one of the building blocks of the protein - to trigger the emergence of these cells.
Professor Colonna said: "We have established a link between one bacterial species - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is part of the normal gut microbiome, and the development of a population of tolerance-boosting cells.
The more tryptophan was in the mice "diet, the more these immune cells they had."
He suggested that the same would work in humans: a combination of L. reuteri and a tryptophan-rich diet could contribute to a more tolerant and less inflammatory environment in the gut.
Postdoc Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barraganwas, while studying a variety of tolerance-boosting immune cells, found that one group of test mice had these cells, while another group, which belonged to the same line but was kept separately, did not.
She suggested that the difference could be caused by the gut microbiomes of mice - communities of bacteria, viruses, and fungi that normally live in the gastrointestinal tract.
DNA from the gut cells of mice was sequenced, and six species of bacteria were found, present in mice with immune cells but absent in mice without them.
Mice raised in a sterile environment that did not have a good microbiome and did not develop this type of immune cell received L. reuteri and developed immune cells.
To understand how bacteria affect the immune system, the researchers grew L. reuteri in a liquid environment and then transferred small portions of the fluid - without the bacteria - to underdeveloped immune cells isolated from mice.
Immune cells have evolved into tolerance-boosting cells.
When the active ingredient was separated from the liquid, it turned out to be a byproduct of tryptophan processing, known as indole-3 lactic acid.
When researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in mice, the number of these cells increased by about 50 percent, but when tryptophan levels were halved, the number of cells also halved.
Dr Cervantes-Barragán explains that humans have the same tolerance-boosting cells as mice, and most of us have L. reuteri in our gastrointestinal tract.
It is not known whether tryptophan by-products from L. reuteri contribute to cell development in humans in the same way as in mice, but defects in tryptophan-related genes have been found in people suffering from inflammatory bowel disease.
She says: "Perhaps we need to strengthen the development of these cells, because these cells are responsible for the inflammatory processes on the inner surface of the gut.
High levels of tryptophan in the presence of L. reuteri have the potential to expand their populations. "
Jose Mourinho believes Manchester United have hired a 'genius' in Nemanja Matic
Manchester United have hired a "genius" in Nemanja Matic, says Jose Mourinho after the midfielder made his debut against Sampdoria on Wednesday night.
The player, who was bought for £40m from Chelsea, started in United's 2-1 win in Dublin in United's last pre-season match before the UEFA Super Cup match against Real Madrid on Thursday and impressed as a midfielder, while players like Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira burst forward whenever they liked.
However, because Matic did not take part in Chelsea's pre-season tour of Asia, he seriously lacked game preparation and lasted only 45 minutes, which Mourinho said required improvement ahead of the Premier League season.
"He needs time, but his experience, his intelligence, his genius in the way he thinks - he thinks football," said Mourinho.
"We will help him prepare sooner rather than later."
Like Matic, his fellow new players Victor Lindelof and started the game at the Aviva Stadium as Mourinho began to shape his core squad for the start of next season.
The Independent reported this week that Mourinho wanted to hire three more players, but stressed that the club had already done fantastic things by hiring three of the four players he wanted to hire first.
"I'm grateful to the club for getting three of the four," he added.

Former leaders of Lithuania's Social Democrats urge them to remain in the ruling coalition
Former chairmen of the Social Democratic Party of Lithuania, former prime ministers Algirdas Butkevičius and Gediminas Kirkilas, as well as former Social Democratic Speaker of the Seimas Ceslovas Juršenas, appealed to their fellow parties to remain in the ruling coalition.
According to the Parliamentary Gazette, tensions with its partners, the Union of Peasants and Greens, have triggered a debate within the Social Democratic Party about whether to remain in the ruling coalition.
And so three senior experienced comrades addressed an open letter to their fellow party members, which reads in part: "It is understandable that comrades in the party are disappointed with the results of the elections, but the coalition with the 'peasants' has created conditions for us, though not very easy, to continue to implement the goals of social justice that we have initiated in the government's program, and to maintain the political dominance of the left center over the right parties."
According to the party's former leaders, the discussion so far has "been dominated by emotive expression of opinion without concrete arguments."
The authors of the letter fear that their party's reckless actions could lead Lithuania to political, economic and social instability.
Disabled Anton Mamayev was fined
The Moscow City Court reduced the punishment of wheelchair user Anton Mamaev from four and a half years in prison to a fine of 200 thousand roubles.
Earlier, by decision of the Timiryazevsky court, the convict was released from the pre-trial detention facility.
At the same time, the Moscow City Court confirmed that the accused is a criminal, because he organized the robbery and theft of a scooter from a former special forces fighter.
The Moscow City Court reduced Anton Mamaev's sentence to 200 thousand roubles.
"Mamaev is the organizer of the robbery, which also constitutes a crime, and, accordingly, such a person should be prosecuted," Ulyana Solopova, press secretary of the Moscow City Court, explained to Kommersant.
In this case, the court took into account Mamaev's state of health, the factual circumstances of the case, and the absence of aggravating circumstances.
In addition, the court applied Article 64 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation, according to which it is possible to impose a penalty below the lower limit.
As for Mamaev's assistant, Vasily Seroshtanov, the court did not establish circumstances that would constitute grounds for changing the gravity of the act and changing the sentence.
Anton Mamaev himself said that he was not satisfied with the decision of the Moscow City Court.
I am disappointed with the court's decision.
The only legitimate solution would be an acquittal, determined to fight on for justice.
His lawyer, Andrei Orlov, did not rule out appealing the verdict to the cassation instance of the Moscow City Court and the Supreme Court.
"We will use all the levers up to the European Court of Human Rights," he told RIA Novosti.
Recall, 28-year-old Muscovite Anton Mamaev, who suffers from spinal muscular atrophy, became a defendant in a criminal case last fall.
The disabled person claims that he bought a scooter from friends for 160 thousand roubles, and then sold it.
However, the owners of the scooter, including a former special forces fighter, claimed that the disabled man and his assistant Vasily Seroshtanov took their property, threatening to use violence.
On June 30, the Timiryazevsky District Court of Moscow sentenced Vasily Seroshtanov to three years in a penal colony, and Anton Mamaev to four and a half years in a penal colony (under Article 162 (2) of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation).
After the immobile disabled person was placed in a pre-trial detention facility, the Public Chamber, the Prosecutor General's Office, and the Presidential Commissioner for Human Rights, Tatiana Moskalkova, became involved in the case.
As a result, in mid-July, Anton Mamaev was released from the pre-trial detention facility by a decision of the same Timiryazev court.
The defense, in turn, appealed the first-instance decision to the Moscow City Court.
ONF will prepare a report on the environment for the president
The final "Action Forum" of the All-Russian People's Front (APF) in 2017 will be devoted to environmental issues, a source in the APF told Izvestia, and Alexei Anisimov, the head of the movement's executive committee, confirmed.
According to him, according to the results of the forum, the "front-line fighters" plan to prepare a report to the President on the problems of the domestic environment, as well as to propose a strategy for solving them.
Interlocutors of Izvestia in the ONF note that the report to the head of state will contain "deep analytics" on the situation in all federal districts of the country.
According to Izvestia, the final forum of the ONF will take place in the autumn.
The exact date of its holding has not yet been determined - as a rule, it is adjusted to the schedule of the President, who is the leader of the movement and is traditionally present at key events of the ONF.
The Front has held several interregional environmental conferences, one for two federal districts - in Rostov-on-Don, Kaliningrad and Kirov.
The final conference will be held in the capital of the Republic of Buryatia, Ulan-Ude.
On the basis of the proposals that have been made and will be made at these events, we will also form systemic proposals to address environmental problems, an interlocutor in the ONF told Izvestia.
Olga Timofeeva, Co-Chair of the Central Staff of the Movement, who heads the State Duma Committee on Ecology and Environmental Protection, reported that the "front-line fighters" would report to the head of state on the work carried out in the framework of the Year of Ecology in Russia.
The final environmental forum and the "Action Forum" of the ONF are likely to be combined.
Over the course of the year, we have grown a powerful team of experts in the field of environmental issues, seen gaps in the legislation, and stopped dozens of violations of the law.
All of this will be included in the report that we are preparing for the president as the leader of our movement.
In addition to this document, "front-line personnel" will report on the work on priority projects of the ONF, Olga Timofeeva told Izvestia.
According to her, Sergei Ivanov, Special Representative of the Head of State for Environmental Protection, Ecology and Transport, will also be invited to the forum.
Earlier, he had already taken part in the work of the APF MediaForum, which was held in April in St. Petersburg.
In a few months, the Year of Ecology will go down in history, and the most important thing that needs to be done today is to launch environmental mechanisms to make them work for years to come.
To ensure that these issues do not fall out of the agenda, "Olga Timofeeva added.
Andrei Kolyadin, Head of the Regional Policy Laboratory of the Expert Institute for Social Research (EISR), noted that by raising environmental issues, the ONF is acting in line with the presidential agenda.
As experts, they proposed many things at various forums, and these initiatives received the support of the president, - Andrei Kolyadin told Izvestia.
He stressed that today, the economic potential of the environmental agenda cannot be ruled out, which may give regions an additional impetus for development.
In the future, with the help of ONF, regions will be able to lobby not only for the solution of their environmental problems, but also for the development of ecotourism, the expert added.
The urgency of the environmental issue was demonstrated by a "direct line" with Vladimir Putin in June.
In particular, the President was asked about the landfill in Balashikha (already closed) and coal dust in the port of Nakhodka (a draft law prohibiting open trans-shipment of coal in populated areas has already been developed, with Olga Timofeeva as one of its authors).
Experts in the field of ecology believe that the legal basis for solving environmental problems in Russia as a whole has been created, the issue is further enforcement practice, as well as the position of civil society.
What is needed is a clear implementation of the decisions taken by the state, believes Leonid Bochin, Head of the Ecology for All Charitable Foundation.
Sergei Tsyplenkov, a member of the Human Rights Council and head of the non-governmental organization Greenpeace of Russia, told Izvestia that a responsible approach by society and business is needed to successfully solve environmental problems; legislative efforts alone are not enough.
As soon as society and business realize that solving environmental problems is a much more profitable step in a strategic perspective, the situation will change, "noted Sergei Tsyplenkov.
The expert emphasized that it is necessary to reverse the trend that violation of environmental legislation is an economically beneficial decision for business.
British inventor implanted a microchip to hit home and car at the stroke of a hand
A British inventor has become the first person in the country to be fitted with a microchip so that he can open the door of his home, enter an office, and even drive a car with a simple wave of his hand.
Thirty-three-year-old Stephen Northam implanted a tiny chip between his thumb and index finger and now offers the service through his firm, BioTech, to firms and individuals who want to simplify their lives with technology.
He has teamed up with Dr Jeff Watson, a consultant anaesthetist at the Royal in Winchester, to ensure that the implantation procedure is carried out in accordance with medical standards.
The technology is similar to a microchip implanted in cats and dogs, and the procedure takes just 30 seconds.
Northam's company is also replacing locks in homes and cars with chip-compatible ones at a cost of £300 per lock.
The married father-of-one has already installed the technology in his home and in his BMW Z4 car, which starts when his hand is on the steering wheel.
Reception for the White House cost taxpayers thousands of dollars
According to military records provided to TIME magazine, the White House's decision last month to bring a Marine helicopter to the South Lawn for an event celebrating American manufacturing cost taxpayers as much as $24,000.
The white-green Sikorsky VH-3D, known as Marine One when the president is on board, was the centerpiece of a July 17 event at the White House to showcase American construction programs.
President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence, and top White House officials toured technology products from all fifty states.
The helicopter, made in Connecticut, was displayed next to a yacht from Maine, a fire truck from Wisconsin, and a loader from Mississippi.
According to records from the Marine Corps First Helicopter Squadron (HMX-1), the division in charge of helicopter operations, the White House Military Office ordered the helicopter's presence on a private order, or "FRAGO," just 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South Lawn for an "unusual" event.
"I just wanted you to make sure you were aware, because this is an unusual, highly publicized event," the commander of HMX-1 wrote in an email to his superiors, the Marine Corps First Deputy Chief of Aviation, on the eve of the event.
The letter stated that the helicopter would arrive on the South Lawn at approximately 7 a.m. on July 17 for the event scheduled for 3 p.m. and remain there until the lawn was cleared between 6 and 9 p.m. that day.
The letter adds that if a departure from the White House is delayed, a second crew will be needed for the return flight, in accordance with operating hours restrictions.
The first crew accompanied the helicopter during the event, while the unit's security personnel remained close to the aircraft while it was on the ground.
It was not clear from the records obtained by TIME whether a second crew was eventually required.
The Hatch Act prohibits federal employees from using public property for political purposes.
According to the records, HMX-1 clarified whether the event did not contravene the order.
"Among other things, we asked if this was a violation of the Hatch Act, and we were told it wasn't," the commander wrote.
"It looks like you have nowhere to go," replied the deputy chief.
The "Made in America" event was announced by the White House as an official event and was not covered by the Hatch Act.
But even official events have political overtones.
During the event, the president sought to advance health-care reform, then in the works in the Senate, and touted efforts to regulate government regulations.
The use of aircraft known as Marine One and Air Force One for political purposes is hardly a new phenomenon.
Presidents are instructed to use them for travel.
But it is unusual to request them solely in the interest of photo opportunity.
Trump was already the subject of controversy in February, when the presidential plane skidded into the background during his first campaign rally in Melbourne, Florida, and his Twitter account was flooded with messages complaining about his predecessor's use of the presidential plane.
"The White House is excited about the" Made in America "show, which featured products from 50 states made by American workers from American materials," said Deputy White House Press Secretary Lindsey Walters.
HMX-1 crews often carry out training flights around the Washington metropolitan area and on the South Lawn to train the United States president's transportation to the White House to within an inch.
When Trump attended the G-20 summit in Germany in early July, HMX-1 conducted 58 training landings near the White House.
According to one of the officials, the flight made for the "Made in America" event was counted against the crew's monthly training flight requirement.
The unit's helicopters also flew 11 extra hours that day as part of "non-presidential support missions."
According to the White House, taxpayers were not charged for any of the other exhibits on display at the event.
A Sikorsky spokesman said the company was not involved in organizing the helicopter demonstration on the South Lawn.
HMX-1 does not keep a budget for presidential flights, and it is difficult to determine the exact amount spent on the event.
But, according to the Defense Department's hourly rate for fiscal year 2017, the Department of Defense reimbursement rate for VH-3D is $24,380 per flight hour.
The unit's records show that the flight time in the air was 30 minutes each way from its base airfield at Quantico Air Force Base in Virginia.
The White House argues that the real cost of using a helicopter is much lower than that rate.
"Calculating the cost to taxpayers based on an approximate rate of reimbursement is completely wrong," Walters said.
"These indicative rates include manpower, maintenance, and many other irreversible costs, which are included in the annual allocations."
According to a 2015 study by RAND Corporation, reimbursement rates do not include the cost of personnel, but do take into account the cost of fuel, maintenance, and expenses specified in the contract.
At the time, former White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer defended the use of a helicopter for the event.
"The idea is to showcase things made in America this week," Spicer said.
"And I know that Sikorsky and the state of Connecticut are very proud of the fact that they contribute to national security, and that there are, I suspect, hundreds, if not thousands, of people whose jobs depend on it.
And I think, like most Americans, that we are all proud of this helicopter and other military hardware that so many Americans have worked tirelessly to build.
So, of course, it is entirely appropriate to pay attention to this. "
It was unclear whether Trump interacted with the helicopter while inspecting the South Lawn during the event, but he certainly sat in the driver's seat of a fire truck.
Inside the White House, Trump addressed Sikorsky, joking with the press about the company's own fleet of products.
"I know Sikorsky very well," the president said. "I have three of them."
Moscow to allocate grants for resuscitation departments of city hospitals
Every year, "Saving Lives" grants will be allocated to intensive care units and intensive care units of the capital's medical clinics.
The funds will be used to reward doctors and nurses.
Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin visited the City Clinical Hospital named after Yudin.
During the inspection of the clinic, he handed over a letter of thanks to the orthopaedic traumatologist Viktor Protsko, under whose supervision the teenager's foot underwent the most complex reconstruction operation.
Sergei Sobyanin also spoke about the decision to annually allocate grants to intensive care units and intensive care units in city clinics.
The funds will be used to reward doctors and nurses.
According to the Mayor of the capital, the Yudin Clinical Hospital is currently one of the largest in Moscow.
In recent years, the clinic has received new modern equipment that allows its doctors to perform unique operations.
The clinic was opened in 1961 on the basis of Kolomna rural hospital.
Currently, the departments of the medical institution are designed to receive more than a thousand patients.
In addition to intensive care and in-patient care, there are day-care units.
The hospital employs 2,800 people.
The total area of the medical clinic is 23.7 hectares.
In February of this year, the medical institution became a participant in a pilot project on the organization of short-term hospital stays (SKP).
They are designed for relatively small operations.
Advanced medical equipment is used in the process of surgery, which allows significantly reducing the time patients take to rehabilitate.
After the surgery, they spend only a few hours in hospital.
In the first half of this year alone, in-patient medical care was provided to 36 thousand patients at the Yudin Clinical Hospital.
The clinic's medical staff performed 15,800 operations of varying complexity.
NBU informed about the absence of buyers for the Ukrainian subsidiary of Sberbank
The National Bank of Ukraine (NBU) reported that there were no bids for the purchase of the Ukrainian subsidiary of Sberbank.
This was reported on Friday, 4 August, TASS reports with reference to a representative of the NBU press service.
The NBU confirms that on August 3, 2017, a package of documents from a citizen of Belarus and Cyprus, Viktor Prokopeni, for the approval of the indirect (through Paritetbank) acquisition of 100 percent of Sberbank shares was withdrawn.
"Documents from other potential investors for the purchase of Sberbank shares have not been received by the NBU," the message reads.
On August 3, Belarusian businessman Viktor Prokopenya withdrew his bid to buy a subsidiary of Sberbank.
On July 28, it became known that the National Bank of Ukraine had denied Russian businessmen Said Gutseriev and Grigory Guselnikov the purchase of a Ukrainian "daughter" of Sberbank.
The regulator justified its decision by the fact that the businessmen did not provide the necessary documents to verify their compliance with the requirements of Ukrainian legislation.
Sberbank announced the sale of its Ukrainian subsidiary to a consortium of Norvik Banka and a private Belarusian company in March this year.
The majority shareholder of the consortium was Said Gutseriev, the son of Russian businessman Mikhail Gutseriev.
Sanctions against the subsidiaries of five Russian banks in Ukraine, including Sberbank, were introduced in mid-March.
During the year, they are prohibited from withdrawing capital from the country in favor of parent organizations.

Democracy in Afghanistan depends on the role of women in politics, the UN has said.
Elections can be representative only when all members of society, including women, participate, the head of the UN mission in Afghanistan said on Wednesday.
According to Nicholas Haysom, the current head of the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan, hundreds of women are running for provincial council elections, three women are running for vice president, and more than 30 percent of newly registered voters are women.
"The role of women cannot be overestimated," he said in a statement on Wednesday.
Choice can be fully representative only when women participate fully and are included in all stages of the electoral process.
Provincial council and presidential elections will be held in Afghanistan on April 5.
The Taliban are threatening to disrupt the electoral process, which coincides with the transition of international forces from combat operations to advisory roles.
This year's election marks the first peaceful transfer of power from one democratically elected government to another.
Haysom said that increasing the role of women would contribute to the success of democracy in Afghanistan.
According to the Afghanistan Independent Election Commission, 1.2 million of the 3.6 million registered voters are women.

Walking around the city in a bathing suit or with a bare torso will now be fined 200 euros.
100 euros will be demanded from those who organize a picnic in a public place or ride a bike through pedestrian areas, TASS reports with reference to the Association of Tour Operators of Russia.

SF relieved Ozerov of the post of head of the committee
The Federation Council on Wednesday supported the statement of the chairman of the Committee on Defense and Security, Viktor Ozerov, and relieved him of this post.
He remains a senator from Khabarovsk Krai.
Ozerov wrote a letter last week asking that he be relieved of his post.
He attributed his decision to the need for rotation and his desire to "change the rhythm of life."
The senator also noted that the decision to leave was not an immediate one.
Viktor Ozerov has represented the Legislative Assembly of Khabarovsk Krai in the Federal Council of the Russian Federation since 1996.
The senator has chaired the Defense and Security Committee since 2001.
Electricity is cheaper for residents and producers in Buryatia
Decades-long efforts by Soviet and post-Soviet authorities in the Republic of Buryatia (Eastern Siberia) to establish fair tariffs for electricity consumers are beginning to bear fruit.
Since September 1, the cost of low-voltage electricity for industrial recipients has been reduced by 25%.
The Federal Antimonopoly Service of the country, in accordance with Resolution of the Government of the Russian Federation "On introducing amendments to the Rules of the Wholesale Electricity and Capacity Market and to the consolidated forecast balance of electricity (capacity) production and supply within the Unified Energy System of Russia for the subjects of the Russian Federation" (No. 842 of 17.07.2017), established indicative prices for electricity and capacity for industrial consumers of the Republic of Buryatia.
As a result, the cost of electricity for Buryat producers is reduced by a quarter, which will make life much easier for small and medium-sized enterprises and individual entrepreneurs.
For decades, the republic's leaders have been beating the doors of Moscow's cabinets in futile attempts to equalize the region in tariffs with the neighboring Irkutsk region with the cascade of hydroelectric power plants on the Angara, flowing from Baikal, the main catchment area for which is Buryatia.
It was only this year that progress began.
In March, electricity tariffs for the population of the Republic were reduced from 4.24 roubles / kWh to 3.93 roubles / kWh, or 7.3%.
With the inclusion of Buryatia, by decision of the federal government, in the List of Wholesale Price Zones, for which the peculiarities of the functioning of wholesale and retail markets are established, it is the turn of industrial consumers.
According to analysts, this is only the beginning, as the population of Irkutsk Oblast pays 1.01 roubles per kilowatt hour.
But no one dares to mention at least an approximate date for new downward tariff movements for Buryatia.
Scooter was not afraid of the Prosecutor General's Office of Ukraine and flew to Crimea
Electronic dance music legend Scooter flew to Crimea without fear of threats from the Prosecutor General's Office of Ukraine.

Ace's last album was released in 2016.
In addition to Scooter, the festival's guests will be Sergei Galanin and his band "Serga," as well as Garik Sukachev and "Brigade C."

National Union of Unskilled, Municipal and Boiler Workers (GMB) concerned about investment at McVitie's Glasgow factory
The union is seeking assurances from managers at biscuit maker McVitie's over its long-term commitment to production at the Glasgow plant.
GMB Scotland said the company remained silent on the future of investment at the Tolkcross site.
The factory, which produces Hobnobs and Rich Tea biscuits, among other products, employs more than 500 people.
Pladis, owner of McVitie's, says it has invested more than £5 million in the property over the past few years.
The company adds that in the event of any changes to the work of the site, employees and union representatives "will be the first to be made aware of them."
In a letter to the manager of the site owned by the company, GMB Scotland demanded McVitie's response to concerns that the funding would not be used to upgrade production lines.
Senior organiser Drew Duffy said: "Our union members are deeply concerned that we are unable to get clarity from the general manager on the business needs and investment plan regarding the future of Tolcross."
Families have worked here for generations, and the concentration of workers is high in the local community and in Greater Glasgow; it is a vital pillar of decent work in an area of high unemployment and social deprivation.
So, in terms of jobs, wages, and prosperity, and against the backdrop of Brexit, rising living standards, and chronic manufacturing decline, Glasgow's East End desperately needs manufacturing at McVitie's to thrive.
A spokeswoman for Pladis said: "The manager of the Tolcross site only received a letter from GMB Scotland yesterday and the company will respond immediately as we appreciate our ongoing co-operation with staff and union representatives."
Two months ago, we held a regular meeting with GMB staff and representatives at Tolcross, where we openly discussed a number of issues.
We spoke to our employees about how, as all companies operating in the most competitive and volatile economic environment, we continually review our actions - and this applies to all of our facilities and activities - to remain competitive.
"In recent years, we have invested more than £5 million in our Tolcross facility, particularly in production lines and improved performance."
We are fully aware of Tolcross's value as a production facility, and should there be any change in operations at that facility, employees and union representatives will be the first to be made aware of it. "
Putin says the authorities will not give instructions to Rosneft and Gazprom
Vladimir Putin has stated that the Kremlin and the cabinet should be involved in the issue of gas supplies to the Eastern Petrochemical Company (VNHC), but no one will give instructions to Gazprom, like Rosneft.
This is how Russian President Vladimir Putin responded to Igor Sechin's request to help resolve the differences that arose.
The head of state drew attention to the fact that relations between Rosneft and Gazprom should be resolved exclusively on the basis of market principles.
Earlier, the head of Rosneft, Igor Sechin, told a meeting on the implementation of major investment projects in the Far Eastern Federal District that the absence of an agreement with Gazprom on gas for the VNHK jeopardized the project's implementation period.
Sechin noted that the dialogue with Gazprom on this issue continues.
Gazprom proposes to find gas resources from the Rosneft perimeter, but we do not have such resources, "Sechin added.
Recall that Rosneft asked to be allowed to use gas from Gazprom's Kirinskoye field, located on the Sakhalin shelf, for the Eastern Petrochemical Company.
In June, Gazprom said that negotiations on the issue were continuing and that there were "no hard corners."
Did PSG warn Barcelona about Neymar's move three years ago?
The La Liga side may regret their interest in Marco Verratti
Paris Saint-Germain will not stop chasing Neymar after the club offered £189m for his buy-out clause, but did they warn Barcelona of a world-record raid three years ago?
The sensational offer revived the summer transfer window when the Ligue 1 club were poised to break the world record for transfer costs, more than double the previous mark set by Paul Pogba's return to Manchester United last season for £89m.
When the transition is complete, Neymar will become the most expensive player in the world and the highest-paid professional athlete in the world, with PSG offering him a salary of more than £500,000 a week.
Barcelona are known to be furious at the way the offer was made and the way Neymar has broken his contract, despite a source close to the Catalan club's management insisting the club have always done their best for the player since his move from Santos in 2013.
But was the football world warned of this possibility three years ago by the president of PSG?
When Manchester City expressed an interest in hiring Blaise Matuidi in 2014, Nasser Al-Khelaifi issued a stern warning to any club that wanted to lure one of PSG's best players.
"I am not worried because they know that if they touch one of our players, then we will oppose them, we will make offers to their players," Al-Khelaifi said.
"We respect all clubs.
But if they try to recruit one of our players, there will be consequences. "
Barcelona appear to have crossed that line when the Spanish club expressed an interest in PSG midfielder Marco Verratti earlier this summer.
PSG have made it clear they will not release the Italian national team player on any terms, and now Barcelona are likely to feel the consequences of their offer in the form of the loss of one of their most valuable players, Neymar.

At first, Putin let a few young men out of the net.
Then he pulled a special lever on the lid of the container and let the others go.
Also during the trip, the leader instructed to deal with the environmental situation on Baikal and to build a road on Olkhon Island.
According to the Ministry of Construction, one volume is needed, and another volume is supposed to be provided.
"I want to deal with it, what, in fact, is going on in our country with regard to financing," the Russian leader emphasized.
