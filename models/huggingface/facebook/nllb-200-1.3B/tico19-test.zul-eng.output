Rapid spread of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in the European Union/European Economic Area and the United Kingdom, from 1 January to 15 March 2020
The increasing incidence of coronavirus (COVID-19) cases reflects similar trends in the European Union/European Economic Area countries and the United Kingdom which ensure that, although at different stages from country to country, the COVID-19 pandemic is progressing rapidly in all countries.
Based on the Italian experience, countries, hospitals and emergency care units should increase their readiness to receive more COVID-19 patients who will need health care, and especially to care for those in critical condition.
On 31 December 2019, a group of pneumonia cases with an unknown etiology was reported in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
On 9 January 2020, the China Center for Disease Control and Prevention reported that the causative agent of the new coronavirus now called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Since then, the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 has been named coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
Evidence to date shows that 80% of people infected with COVID-19 have a minor illness, i.e. respiratory tract infection with or without pneumonia, and most of these people recover.
In 14% of cases, COVID-19 progresses to a severe illness requiring hospitalization while the remaining 6% of cases develop a severe illness requiring emergency care.
The death rate of COVID-19 patients in hospital is 4%.
In this study, we assess the trends in increasing COVID-19 incidence in each country of the European Union/European Economic Area (EU/EEA) and the United Kingdom (UK) and compare them to those in Hubei Province, China.
We also compare the current number of COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and the UK with those in Italy between 31 January and 15 March 2020.
COVID-19 situation in EU/EEA and UK
After China, COVID-19 spread widely in different regions and the global COVID-19 pandemic is currently following the trend in this country.
On 11 March 2020, the Director General of the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 to be a pandemic.
The 5 March 2020 issue of Eurosurveillance, Spiteri et al. reported the first confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Europe that are consistent with the WHO definition.
In the EU/EEA, the first confirmed cases were reported by France on 24 January 2020 in people returning from Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
As of 15 March 2020, COVID-19 cases had been detected in all 30 EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom (UK), meaning that between 31 December 2019 and that date, 39,768 cases and 1,727 deaths had been reported, of which 17,750 cases and 1,441 deaths were in Italy alone.
Identifying the increasing number and incidence of COVID-19 cases
At the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), the statistics of COVID-19 cases in each country worldwide, which are only detected from official sources such as the Ministry of Health of each country, national and regional health authorities and WHO, are updated daily at 8:00 a.m.
This data was used to analyze COVID-19 trends in the EU/EEA and the UK, and compared with those in Italy.
As a representative of the prevalence of ongoing COVID-19 cases, we have calculated a 14-day sustained increase in COVID-19 cases, thus taking into account the natural continuation of COVID-19, in each EU/EEA country and UK, during the period 1 January15 March 2020.
We also reported an increasing number of cases reported for each country on 15 March 2020 at 8:00 a.m. compared to Italy during the period of 31 January15 March 2020.
COVID-19 trends in EU/EEA and UK countries
The trends in the 14-day interrupted incidence increase of COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and the UK generally follow those in Hubei Province (China) (Figure 1).
Across the EU/EEA and UK, the increasing COVID-19 case began to rise around 21 February and peaked on 28 February 2020 (Appendix).
This is largely compounded by the rapid increase in the number of cases reported from Italy, but all other EU/EEA countries and the UK show similar upward trends in the increasing incidence of COVID-19 (Study Appendix).
Figure 2 shows the increasing number of COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and the UK compared to those in Italy during the period 31 January15 March 2020.
It highlights that, by 15 March 8:00 a.m., 15 other EU/EEA countries and the UK had already reported a total number comparable to that of Italy 3 weeks earlier or less.
Our results show that the number of reported cases of COVID-19 is increasing rapidly in the EU/EEA and the UK.
Trends observed in the increasing COVID-19 case indicate that the epidemic is proceeding at the same rate in all countries.
This is despite the fact that countries are at different stages, variations in national public health response, and likely different definitions of conditions in countries and different protocols for selecting patients to be tested for COVID-19, including tracking testing.
In early March 2020, doctors in the affected regions of Italy described a situation where 10% of COVID-19 patients required emergency care and media reported that hospitals and intensive care units in these regions had reached their maximum capacity.
Data on admission of COVID-19 patients to hospital and/or intensive care unit is available in the EU/EEA category in only 6% and 1% of cases, respectively (data not shown).
It should, however, be collected in an orderly manner to match current surveillance data focusing on the number of reported cases and the number of deaths.
A 2010 study11 showed a large variation in the availability of intensive care and mid-care beds in Europe, from 29.2 in Germany to 4.2 beds per 100,000 population in Portugal.
This means that countries may have more or less facilities than Italy (12.5 acute and medium care beds per 100,000 population in 2010).
A simulation of conditions related to healthcare capacity overload, which gives an estimate for each EU/EEA and UK country regarding the increase in COVID-19 hospitalizations associated with a risk of > 90% overcapacity of intensive care beds, is provided in the sixth update of the ECDC's COVID-19 rapid risk assessment.
As cases are concentrated in certain regions in EU/EEA countries and the UK, and hospitals and intensive care units usually serve certain population groups of the region, information on cases and intensive care beds should be available at the Nomenclature of territorial units for statistics 2 (NUTS-2).
The experience in Italy and current trends in other countries show that the COVID-19 pandemic is growing rapidly in the EU/EEA and the UK.
Countries, hospitals and intensive care units should prepare for the continuing SARS-CoV-2 carrier infection situation and the increasing number of COVID-19 patients requiring medical care, and especially intensive care, such as that occurring in the affected regions of Italy.
As demonstrated in a recent ECDC rapid risk assessment, a fast, dynamic and detailed approach is essential to delay the spread of SARS-COV-2, by making the transition from a controlled approach to a reductionist approach, as the expected rapid increase in the number of cases may not give decision-makers and hospitals enough time to understand, accept and adapt their response to the appropriate course if not implemented early.
Early risk assessment also means public health measures to control the impact of an epidemic.
There is a small window of opportunity where countries cannot have the opportunity to further regulate their control efforts to reduce the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and reduce the pressure on health care.
Failure of this, it is likely that the healthcare systems of some EU/EEA countries will face a large number of patients requiring urgent care in the coming days or weeks.
The outbreak of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has so far killed more than 3,000 people and infected more than 80,000 people in China and elsewhere in the world, resulting in a catastrophic outbreak for the population.
Like its cousin, SARS-CoV, which caused SARS in thousands of people in 2003, SARS-CoV-2 can also be transmitted from bats and cause similar symptoms in a similar manner.
However, COVID-19 has a higher severity and mortality rate than SARS but is more transmissible and affects more adults than young people and more men than women.
In response to the rapidly increasing number of publications on an emerging disease, this article attempts to provide a timely and detailed review of a rapidly advancing research topic.
We will discuss the basics of epidemiology, etiology, virology, diagnosis, treatment, cause, and prevention of disease.
While many questions still need to be answered, we hope that this review helps to understand and eliminate this threatening disease.
The Spring Festival of January 25, 2020 has become an incomparable and unforgettable memory for all Chinese who are encouraged to stay in their homes for the holidays and for weeks afterwards due to the outbreak of a new virus infection.
The virus is very similar to the coronavirus (CoV) that caused the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003; as a result, it was named SARS-CoV-2 by the World Health Organization (WHO) on February 11, 2020, and the related disease was named COVID-19 (COVID-19).
The epidemic began in Wuhan, China, and quickly spread throughout the country and to some 50 other countries worldwide.
As of March 2, 2020, the virus led to more than 80,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19, with more than 40,000 patients discharged from hospital and more than 3,000 patients dying.
WHO warns that COVID-19 is the world's worst public enemy and may be more powerful than terrorism.
According to PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/), in less than two months, more than 200 papers have been published on COVID-19 covering its virology, epidemiology, etiology, diagnosis, and treatment since the first report on January 7, 2020 that determined the virus sequence isolated from multiple patients.
This revision attempts to summarize the progress of research on a new and rapidly developing topic.
Whenever possible, we will try to compare COVID-19 with SARS and another COVID-related disease, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS, 2012 outbreak).
We will also discuss what we have learned so far about prevention and the cause of disease as well as other remaining but important questions.
CoVs generally considered non-lethal pathogens in humans primarily cause 15% of common illnesses 4.
However, in this century, we have twice faced highly pathogenic human CoVs, namely, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which caused epidemics that began in China in 2003 and Saudi Arabia in 2012, respectively, and quickly spread to other countries causing severe illness and death.
Therefore, the current COVID-19 is the third outbreak of theCoV in recorded human history.
As indicated in Death. Death.1,1, clusters of pneumonia with unknown origin were first reported in Wuhan on December 31, 2019 to the China National Health Commission.
Seven days later the COVID-19 sequence was released.
On January 15, 2020, the first case of death was reported in Wuhan.
Meanwhile, the plague spread quickly to neighboring cities, provinces, and countries.
On January 20, infection among health workers was reported, suggesting that human transmission was possible.
On January 23, the city of Wuhan was completely shut down and all public transportation was suspended.
On January 24 the first clinical study of the disease reported that, of 41 confirmed cases, only 21 had direct contact with the Wuhan seafood market that was considered the original source of the disease from an unknown animal source.
On January 30, the WHO declared a global health emergency.
At the time of this report, the disease had spread throughout China and to some 50 countries worldwide (Fig. 2).
With the situation changing rapidly, the fate and severity of the epidemic remain unknown.
On February 11, 2020, a multi-center study of 8,866 patients including 4,021 who had been confirmed to have COVID-19 showed a more updated picture of the epidemic as follows (https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/Ul-Bi-HX_rHPXa1qHA2bhdA).
SARS-CoV-2 has infected people of all ages, but mainly ages 30-65.
Nearly half (47.7%) of the patients were over 50 years of age, a few were under 20, and only 14 were less than 10 patients.
SARS-CoV-2 has infected more men (0.31/100,000) than women (0.27/100,000).
COVID-19 grew in clusters mainly in Hubei and nearby regions.
COVID-19 took an average of 5 (2-9) days from onset to diagnosis.
The average incubation period was 4.8 days (3.0-7.2).
The average time from onset to death is 9.5 days (4.8-13).
The basic reproduction number (R0) was 3.77 (95% CI: 3.51-4.05), and the modified R0 was 2.23-4.82.
The number of infected people increased rapidly before 23 Jan. 2020, which coincided with the mass evacuation period before the Spring Festival in China.
Mortality in patients with confirmed conditions was 1.44% (95% CI: 1.10-1.86%), and the modified mortality rate for all patients was 3.06% (95% CI: 2.02-4.59%).
The three main risk factors for COVID-19 were sex (men), age (≥60), and severe pneumonia.
CoVs are part of a large family of secreted viruses that contain a single strand of sensory RNA.
They can be divided into four categories, namely alpha, beta, gamma, and delta, meaning that alpha and beta CoVs are not known to infect humans.
The spike (S) of the glycoprotein envelope attaches to the cell receptors for angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, respectively, and membrane synthesis occurs.
The viral RNA gene is released from the cytoplasm; after the viral gene is replicated, the viral RNA that binds to the glycoprotein envelope and the nucleocapsid proteins forms vesicles containing virion, which fuse with the plasma membrane to release the virus.
The first SARS-CoV-2 gene sequencing was reported on January 10, 2020.
SARS-CoV-2 was identified as a new beta-CoV variant with 99.98% genetic identity during 10 consecutive samples collected at the first site of the outbreak, Huanan Seafood Market in Wuhan.
SARS-CoV-2 is generally more similar to SARS-CoV than MERS-CoV.
Using electron transfer microscopy, SARS-CoV-2 particles were detected in the most transparent parts of the respiratory epithelium in humans.
Human ACE2 was found to be a receptor for both SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV.
However, the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 binds to human ACE2 much more rapidly than that of SARS-CoV, which is consistent with the fact that SARS-CoV-2 causes less severe infection in patients than SARS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 can also form a new short protein produced by orf3b and a secreted protein produced by orf8.
SARS-CoV-2 orf3b may play a role in the pathogenicity of the virus and may inhibit the expression of IFNβ; however, orf8 does not contain any known active pathogen or motif.
On February 18, 2020, Zhou, et al., reported a cryo-EM structure of human ACE2 with a full length at 2.9 Å resolution associated with the amino acid transporter B0AT1.
It was found that this connective, with both open and closed structures, was bound as a dimer and the ACE2-B0AT1 connective was able to bind two S proteins, providing evidence for both COVID detection and infection.
B0AT1 may be a therapeutic target in drug trials to suppress SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Origin and intermediate host
It is known that both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV originated in bats and were transmitted to humans by civet cats and camels, respectively.
By comparing the phylogenetic of SARS-CoV-2 with other CoVs, bats were recognized as the original host of SARS-CoV-2 as the new virus is 96% similar to two SARS-like CoVs from bats called bat SL-CoVZX45 and bat SL-CoVZX21.
However, which host intervened to help the virus cross the biological boundary to infect humans is unknown, and the transmission route is yet to be determined.
Ji, et al., suggested that snakes may be carriers of the virus from bats to humans which involved the recombination of similar traits within the S protein.
According to a study, researchers in Guangzhou, China, suggest that pangolins - long-nosed, ant-eating mammals commonly used as traditional Chinese medicine - may be the median hosts of SARS-CoV-2 based on 99% of the genetic characteristics of the COVID-19 virus found in pangolins and SARS-CoV-2.
However, the 1% spread difference between the two genes makes a big difference; therefore, the confirmed results of strong femininity are still pending (Fig. 33).
The physicochemical properties of SARS-CoV-2 are largely unknown at this time.
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV can survive without a host for up to 48 hours in dry conditions and up to 5 days at 20 °C and 40%-50%.
SARS-CoV-2 may have similar characteristics.
SARS-CoV-2 has been reported to be resistant to ultraviolet radiation and 56 °C for 30 minutes; ether, 75% ethanol, chlorine-based disinfectant, perocetic acid, chloroform, and other fatty solvents, but not chlorhexidine, can effectively inhibit the virus.
All people generally lack antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 and are therefore at risk of contracting the new virus.
Currently, no detailed studies have been reported on the immune response to SARS-CoV-2.
Therefore, we can only refer to previous studies of other CoVs, especially SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Fig. (Fig.4).4).
Usually, after the virus has invaded the body, it is first recognized by the host's natural immune system by pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) that include type C lectin-like receptors, toll-like receptor (TLR), NOD-like receptor (NLR), and RIG-like receptor (RLR).
Through different pathways, the virus causes the expression of inflammatory features, the formation of dendritic cells, and the production of type I interferons (IFNs) that inhibit the spread of the virus and accelerate the macrophage phagocytosis of the virus antigens.
However, the N protein of SARS-CoV can help the virus escape the immune response.
Soon, the adaptive immune response joins the war against the virus.
T lymphocytes that combine CD4+ and CD8+ T cells play an important role in protection.
CD4+ T cells stimulate B cells to produce specific antibodies, and CD8+ T cells directly kill infected cells.
Helper T cells produce proinflammatory cytokines to aid the immune cells.
However, the COVID-19 virus can inhibit T cell function by producing T cell apoptosis.
Humor immunity including complementary substances such as C3a and C5a and immune systems is also important in the fight against viral infection.
For example, antibodies derived from a recovered patient inhibit the MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, an overreaction of the immune system builds up a large number of radicals in the area that can cause severe damage to the lungs and other body organs, and, in the worst case, multiple organ failure and even death.
SARS-CoV-2, which is the first-in-class strain as a group, is more likely to infect adults with comorbidities and pregnant women.
It is common for people who are exposed to a large number of germs or have compromised immune function to be more likely to be infected than others.
The average causal period of SARS-CoV-2 infection is 1-14 days, in most cases 3-7 days based on an initial study of 425 people in Wuhan.
However, a study of 1,099 people shows that the incubation period was an average of 3 days and ranged from 0 to 24 days.
A recent study, as described above, showed that the incubation period was 4.8 days (3.0-7.2) based on information from 8,866 people.
It is of great importance for health authorities to change the quarantine time based on the correct immunization period, thereby preventing infected but asymptomatic people from passing the virus on to others.
As a general practice, people who are exposed to, or infected with, the virus need to quarantine for 14 days.
Should the quarantine period be extended to 24 days?
Fever is usually the primary and primary symptom of COVID-19, which may not be accompanied by other symptoms or symptoms such as coughing without coughing, shortness of breath, muscle pain, dizziness, headache, sore throat, rhinorrhea, chest pain, diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting.
Some patients experienced dyspnea and/ or hypoxemia within one week of onset of the disease.
In severe cases, patients progressed quickly to severe respiratory illness, septic shock, metabolic acidosis, and coagulopathy.
Patients with fever and/or respiratory symptoms and severe fever, even if no abnormalities are seen in the powder picture, should be screened for the virus for early diagnosis.
A population data survey conducted in late December 2019 showed a percentage of symptoms that were 98% fever, 76% non-coughing cough, 55% dyspnea, and 3% diarrhea; 8% needed a breathing machine.
Similar findings were reported in two recent studies of a family group and a group caused by infection by an asymptomatic person.
In comparison, a population data study in 2012 showed that MERS-CoV patients also had fever (98%), cough without coughs (47%), and dyspnea (55%) as their main symptoms.
However, 80% of them needed ventilation, which is much more than patients with COVID-19 and corresponds to a higher mortality rate for MERS than for COVID-19.
Diarrhoea (26%) and sore throat (21%) were also observed in MERS patients.
In SARS patients, fever (99%-100%), cough without coughing (29%-75%), dyspnea (40%-42%), diarrhea (20-25%), and sore throat (13-25%) were shown to be the major symptoms and respiratory assisted breathing was necessary in about 14%-20% of patients.
On February 14, the death toll from COVID-19 was 2% when confirmed cases reached 66,576 worldwide.
In comparison, SARS-related deaths in November 2002 amounted to 10 percent of all confirmed cases, 8,096.
With MERS, based on a population data survey in June 2012, the death rate was 37% of the 2,494 confirmed cases.
The initial study reported that the R0 of SARS-CoV-2 was 6.47 higher with a 95% confidence gap (CI) of 5.71-7.23, whereas the R0 of SARS-CoV had a range of 2 to 4.
Comparisons of SARS-CoV-2 with MERS-CoV and with SARS-CoV in terms of their symptoms, mortality, and R0 are represented in Table Table1.1.
The above figures suggest that SARS-CoV-2 has a much higher potential for infection than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, but has less lethal potential than both.
Therefore, it is more challenging to control the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV.
The initiation of a collection usually takes place in the same family or in the same circle or by means of transport such as a cruise ship.
Patients generally have a history of visiting or living in Wuhan or other affected areas or contact with infected people or patients in the last two weeks before the onset.
However, it has been reported that people can carry the virus without symptoms for more than two weeks and vaccinated patients discharged from the hospital may be able to carry the virus again, issuing a warning to extend the quarantine period.
Patients have normal or reduced numbers of peripheral white blood cells (mostly lymphocytes) in the early stages.
For example, lymphopenia with a white blood cell count of < 4×109/L including a lymphocyte count of < 1×109/L, and high levels of aspartate aminotransferase and viremia were found in 1,099 COVID-19 patients.
Liver-muscle enzyme and myoglobin levels were high in the blood of some patients, and C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation were high in the blood of many patients.
In critically ill patients, the level of D-dimer, a breakdown product of fibrin present in the blood, was high, and the number of lymphocytes was markedly reduced.
Abnormalities were found in chest radiography of many COVID-19 patients and with features of double-ply shadow or ground glass opacity in the lungs.
Patients often suffer from a rare pneumonia, severe lung damage, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
When ARDS occurs, uncontrolled inflammation, fluid buildup, and progressive fibrosis jeopardize the exchange of gases.
Type-I and type-II pneumocyte dysfunction decreases the level of surfactant and increases surface tension, thereby reducing the lung's ability to expand and increasing the risk of lung failure.
Therefore, the worst effects of radiography often correspond to the most severe stage of the disease.
On 18 February 2020, the initial pathological analysis of COVID-19 showed pneumocyte leakage, hyaline membrane formation, and interstitial lymphocyte access, and multinucleated syncytial cells in the lungs of a patient who died of the disease, which is consistent with viral disease pathology and ARDS and similar to that of SARS and MERS patients.
The detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA using reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used as the main criterion for the diagnosis of COVID-19.
However, due to the high number of false positives, which could hasten the epidemic, medical imaging was first used in diagnostics (which did not rely solely on RT-PCR) in China on February 13, 2020.
A similar situation arose with the diagnosis of SARS.
Therefore, a combination of medical history, medical imaging, laboratory tests, and radiological results is important and essential to making a successful diagnosis.
On February 14, 2020, Feng Zhang's team described a protocol for using the CRISPR-based SHERLOCK method for SARS-CoV-2 detection, which detects non-natural SARS-CoV-2 RNA fragments at 20 × 10-18 mol/L to 200 × 10-18 mol/L (10-100 copies per microliter of insertion) using a filler rod in less than an hour without requiring sophisticated equipment.
We hope that the new method will greatly improve sensitivity and benefits if confirmed in clinical samples.
Due to the lack of experience with the new COVID, doctors are primarily able to provide supportive care to COVID-19 patients, while testing a variety of therapies that have been used or previously recommended to treat other COVID such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV and other viral infections (Table (Table2).2).
These include current and potential therapies such as antibiotics, immunosuppressants, steroids, plasma from recovered patients, Chinese medicine, and psychological help.
The use of plasma from recovered patients as a treatment has even been suggested.
Pharmaceutical companies compete to develop antibodies and vaccines against the virus.
SARS-CoV-2 primarily attacks the lungs initially and is likely to also attack, to a lesser extent, other body organs that express ACE2, such as the gastrointestinal system and the kidneys.
Still, dysfunction and respiratory failure are a major threat to patients and a major cause of death.
Therefore, respiratory support is essential to relieve symptoms and save lives and includes routine oxygen therapy, high oxygen flow, ventilation without anesthesia, and ventilation with anesthesia depending on the severity of the disease.
Patients with severe respiratory symptoms should be supported using extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), a standardized cardiopulmonary surgery method used to treat life-threatening heart or respiratory failure.
In addition, electrolyte balance maintenance, prevention and treatment of secondary infections and septic shock, and functional protection of key organs are also important for SARS-CoV-2 patients.
It is known that the cytokine storm is the result of an overreaction of the immune system in SARS and MERS patients.
The cytokine storm is an inflammatory system reaction characterized by the release of a series of cytokines including TNFα, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6, IFNα, IFNβ, IFNγ, and MCP-1.
These cytokines that stimulate the immune system to release large amounts of free radicals are the primary cause of ARDS and multiple organ failure.
Immunosuppression is essential in the treatment of cytokine storms, especially in critically ill patients.
Corticosteroids and tocilizumab, a monoclonal anti-IL6 antibody, have been used to treat cytokine storm.
Other treatments for cytokine storm immunodepression include the regulation of T-cell-directed immune response; inhibition of IFN-γ, IL-1, and TNF; inhibition of JAK; blinatumomab; cytokine signal activation suppressor 4; and HDAC inhibitors.
Steroids, such as immunosuppressants, are widely used in the treatment of SARS to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage.
However, high doses of steroids have not been effective in severe lung damage in patients with SARS and COVID-19.
Rather, it may cause serious adverse effects, especially avascular osteonecrosis, which significantly impairs prognosis.
However, a short-term corticosteroid regimen in low to moderate doses has been recommended for careful use in critically ill COVID-19 patients.
At the time of writing, no effective anti-virus treatment had been established.
However, an intravenous injection with remdesivir, a nucleotide analogue, was found to be effective in an American patient with COVID-19.
Remdesivir is a new antiviral drug that was first developed by Gilead to treat infections caused by the Ebola and Marlburg viruses.
Later, remdesivir also showed that it could inhibit single-stranded RNA viruses including MERS and SARS.
Based on this, Gilead has provided China with a component to conduct research on people infected with SARS-CoV-2, and the results are being looked forward to.
In addition, baricitinb, interferon-α, lopinavir/ritonavir, and ribavirin have been suggested as potential treatments for patients with severe respiratory symptoms.
Diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, liver damage, and other serious reactions may occur after combination therapy with lopinavir/ritonavir.
The interaction of this therapy with other medications used in patients should be carefully monitored.
Plasma from recovered patients and immune system formation
The collection of blood from patients who have recovered from an infectious disease to treat other patients with the same disease or to protect healthy people from contracting the disease has a long history.
In fact, recovered patients often have a higher level of immune system in their blood.
Antibodies are immunoglobulins (Ig) produced by B lymphocytes to fight infections and other unnecessary substances in the body and are able to identify cells that are different from infections and to directly disable them.
Based on this, plasma was collected from the blood of a group of recovered COVID-19 patients and injected into 10 critically ill patients.
Their symptoms improved within 24 hours, accompanied by reduced inflammation and increased levels of germs and oxygen in the blood.
However, confirmation and clarification are needed to make a proposal for a more widespread use of the method before a particular treatment can be developed.
In addition, in consideration of the treatment outcome, other disadvantages associated with plasma should be carefully considered.
For example, immunes can over-stimulate the immune response and cause cytokine release, which can be life-threatening.
The amount of antibodies in the blood is usually low, and the demand for plasma is too great to treat critically ill patients.
It is difficult to develop and produce specific antibodies quickly enough to fight a global pandemic.
Hence, it is very important and sensible to isolate B cells from recovered patients and to mark the genetic codes with the active genes or to screen for active antibodies to represent the vital proteins of the virus.
In this way, we can increase the production of antibodies.
TCM has been used to treat a variety of ailments in China for thousands of years.
Its effects, however, depend largely on the combination of many components in a formula that varies according to the diagnosis based on the TCM theory.
Most active ingredients remain unknown or unclear as it is difficult to isolate and confirm such ingredients or their best-functioning combinations.
Meanwhile, due to the lack of effective and direct treatment for COVID-19, TCM has become one of the main treatments for patients with mild to moderate symptoms for those recovering in critical stages.
For example, Shu Feng Jie Du and Lian Hua Qing Wen pills were found to be effective in treating COVID-19.
High treatment rates in the treatment of COVID-19 patients were noted in many Chinese provinces that used TCM in 87% of their patients, including Gansu (63.7%), Ningxia (50%), and Hunan (50%), while Hubei province, which used TCM in about 30% of its COVID-19 patients, had the lowest recovery rate (13%).
This is an inaccurate comparison, however, since other influential factors such as the number and severity of patients must be included in the analysis.
On February 18, 2020, Boli Zhang and colleagues published a study comparing Western medicine (WM) treatment alone with WM and TCM combination treatment.
They found that the time required for body temperature to recover, symptoms to subside, and hospitalization were shorter in the WM+TCM group than in the WM group alone.
Most impressively, the severity of symptoms (from mild to severe) was significantly lower in the WM+TCM group than in the WM group alone (7.4% versus 46.2%) and mortality was lower in the WM+TCM group than in the WM group alone (8.8% versus 39%).
Nevertheless, the effectiveness and safety of TCM still await well-controlled studies at large levels and in many institutions.
It may also be interesting to note the course of action and clarify the active components of the TCM treatment or its combinations if possible.
Patients suspected or confirmed to have COVID-19 are often more afraid of the highly contagious and deadly disease, and people who isolate themselves become bored, lonely, and angry.
In addition, infectious symptoms such as fever, hypoxia, and coughing as well as serious medical effects such as corticosteroid-induced insomnia can lead to increased anxiety and mental depression.
In the early stages of the SARS outbreak, a number of psychiatric disorders including chronic depression, anxiety, panic attacks, impaired motor skills, signs of dementia, delirium, and even suicidal thoughts were reported.
The forced social distancing and quarantine, as part of the public health response to the COVID-19 outbreak, may make many people anxious and feel guilty about the effects of contagion, quarantine, and maltreatment on their family and friends.
As a result, mental health care should be provided to COVID-19 patients, people suspected of having it, and people in contact with them and the general public who need it.
Psychological support should include the establishment of multidisciplinary mental health teams, clear communication with regular and accurate updates on the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak and treatment plans and the use of electrotherapy devices and close contact avoidance programs.
Effective vaccines are essential to break the chain of transmission from infected animals and humans to potential hosts and are often compatible with antibiotics in the control of new infections.
Efforts have been made to develop vaccines based on the S protein to create long-term and potent killer immunes and/or protection from SARS-CoV infection.
Deactivated live vaccines have been tested in animals for SARS.
However, the biological efficacy of these vaccine candidates in adults and models of the deadly strain and their protection against animal-to-human infection is yet to be determined before clinical research can begin.
This is because SARS ceased to exist 17 years ago and no new cases have been reported since.
On the other hand, rare cases and clusters of MERS continue to emerge from the Middle East and spread to other regions because of persistent sources of animal-to-human viruses in infected areas.
Vaccination techniques have been developed for MERS using a non-active virus, DNA plasmids, viral vectors, nanoparticles, virus-like particles, and subunits of a complex protein, and others have been tested in animal models.
The development of a safe and effective vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 in infected populations is an urgent and important task in controlling the ongoing epidemic.
However, it is challenging to cope with the difficulties due to the long period (average of 18 months) required to develop a vaccine and the changing varieties of CoVs.
As a new disease, COVID-19 has recently begun to show its full treatment program in thousands of patients.
In most cases, patients can recover relatively well without the effects of previous illness.
However, like SARS and MERS, COVID-19 is also associated with a high morbidity and mortality rate among critically ill patients.
Therefore, modeling the cause of disease is essential for health care agencies to get their services up to speed, especially in areas with limited resources.
Based on clinical studies reported so far, the following factors may affect or be associated with the cause of COVID-19 patients (Table (Table33):
Age: Age has been a major factor in causing SARS, which is also true of COVID-19.
COVID-19 occurred mainly in the 30-65 age group and 47.7% of those patients were over 50 in the 8,866 patient study as described above.
Patients who required critical care were at higher risk of other diseases and complications and were significantly older than those without them (age 66 versus 51), suggesting that age is a factor in outcome in COVID-19 patients.
Gender: SARS-CoV-2 has infected more males than females (0.31/100,000 versus 0.27/100,000), as described above.
Pre-existing and complicated diseases: COVID-19 patients requiring intensive care are at higher risk of developing severe heart damage and arrhythmias.
Heart-related events were also the leading cause of death among SARS patients.
It has also been reported that SARS-CoV-2 is able to bind to ACE2-positive cholangiocytes, which may lead to liver dysfunction in COVID-19 patients.
It is good to note that age and preexisting disease are related to hardness and may interfere.
Unusual laboratory results: The level of C-reactive protein (CRP) in the blood indicates the severity of inflammation or tissue damage and has been suggested as a potential factor in disease, response to treatment, and complete recovery.
A link between CRP levels and severity and the cause of COVID-19 was also made.
In addition, elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and creatine kinase (CK) may also help predict the outcome.
These enzymes are widely expressed in many organs, especially the heart and liver, and are released during muscle injury.
As a result, they are common indicators of heart or liver failure.
Major medical symptoms: Chest radiography and transient treatment symptoms should be considered along with other predictive issues and complications of COVID-19.
Steroid use: As described above, immunosuppressant steroids are often used as an adjunct treatment for infectious diseases to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage.
With the widespread use of high doses of corticosteroids in patients with severe SARS, most survivors had avascular osteonecrosis with lifelong disability and poor quality of life.
Therefore, if necessary, steroids should be used in low doses and for a short period of time in COVID-19 patients.
Depression: As described above, during the COVID-19 outbreak many patients suffered from severe depression as they had to endure long periods of isolation and extreme uncertainty and witness the deaths of close family members and fellow patients.
Long-term counseling and support are essential to help these patients recover from depression and return to normal life.
According to studies of human knowledge to date, COVID-19 appears to have epidemiological features distinct from SARS.
In addition to reproducing in the lower respiratory tract, SARS-CoV-2 is able to reproduce easily in the upper respiratory tract and cause little or no symptoms in the early stage of infection, in the same way as the common cold-causing CoVs.
Therefore, infected patients in the early stage or the immunization period may produce large amounts of the virus during daily activities, causing great difficulties in controlling the epidemic.
However, SARS-CoV infection was thought to occur when patients were severely ill, while most infections did not occur in the early stage.
As a result, the COVID-19 outbreak is more serious and harder to control than the SARS outbreak.
There are several ongoing efforts in China currently including the lockdown of Wuhan and surrounding cities and the continuing lockdown of the entire population in the hope of disrupting the transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
While these measures have caused serious economic and other damage to the country, the number of new cases is declining, indicating a slowdown in the epidemic.
The most promising estimate is that the outbreak will end in March and the phase of decline will continue for 3-4 months.
However, some scholars have doubts.
Paul Hunter, et al., estimate that COVID-19, which appears to be more transmissible than SARS, will not be eliminated by 2020.
Ira Longini, et al., developed a model to predict the outcome of the pandemic and suggested that SARS-CoV-2 may infect two-thirds of the global population.
A Canadian team reported that SARS-CoV-2 was detected in both mid-turbinate and throat swabs of patients who recovered and were discharged from hospital two weeks earlier, suggesting that the newly discovered virus may be a recurrent flu-like episode.
However, promising signs are emerging in China based on the declining number of new cases, indicating that current strategies may be working.
Ebola was originally predicted to infect one million people and kill half a million.
However, thanks to strict isolation and confinement, the disease was eventually brought under control.
It is possible, like SARS-CoV, that SARS-CoV-2 may become weakened and eventually become extinct or become a less virulent virus capable of surviving humans.
A comparison of the COVID-19 pandemic with that of SARS and MERS is given below (Fig. 55).
SARS-CoV-2 is most commonly transmitted by coughing or sneezing, and possibly by direct contact with infected objects.
The virus was also found in the feces, opening up a new opportunity for fecal-oral transmission.
A recent study of 138 patients reported that 41 percent of the patients may have been hospitalized, including 17 patients who had previously had other illnesses and 40 health care providers.
Therefore, great care must be taken to protect people, especially health care providers, social workers, family members, coworkers, and even people who stand near patients or infected people.
The first line of protection that may be used to reduce the risk of infection is wearing face masks; both the use of surgical masks and N95 respirator masks (series # 1860s) help to control the spread of germs.
Surgical face masks prevent fluid droplets from a person who may be infected from moving through the air and sticking to the surface of objects, where they can be transmitted to other people.
However, only N95 masks (series # 1860s) can protect against inhalation of small virions at 10 to 80 nm, while only 5% of the virions are fully permeable; SARS-CoV-2 is the same size as SARS-CoV both at about 85 nm.
Since particles can pass through five combined surgical masks, health care providers who work directly with patients must wear N95 masks (series # 1860s) and not surgical masks.
In addition to masks, health-care providers should wear well-fitting protective gloves to further reduce contact with germs.
Bacteria can enter a person through the eyes.
On 22 January 2020, the doctor was infected with SARS-CoV-2 although he was wearing an N95 mask; the virus may have entered his body by entering his eyes and swelling.
As a result, health-care providers should also wear non-reflective face shields or glasses when working with patients.
In the general population in areas affected or likely to be affected, it is highly recommended that everyone wash their hands with soap more often than usual, try to stay indoors to isolate themselves and limit contact with people who may be infected.
A three-step distance is considered to be the proper distance for people to stay away from patients.
These are effective ways to reduce the risk of infection and prevent the spread of the virus.
Although SARS-CoV-2 arrived as a new virus in the human world, its similarity in structure to SARS-CoV as reported on 7 January 2020 should have been a warning to China because it still remembered the SARS outbreak in 2003.
However, it was not until 19 January 2020 that the director of the Center for Disease Control in Wuhan assured the citizens that the new virus is less transmissible and has less replication when transferred from one person to another and that it is not a problem to prevent and control the disease.
This message caused the public to be wary, especially when the whole country was preparing for the Spring Festival, and they missed a critical time to control the virus while it was still in Wuhan.
Chinese disease control agencies may learn from this critical lesson and make important improvements in the future.
For example, these agencies should (1) be more careful in making public announcements as each word is important to citizens and can change their attitudes and decisions; (2) be more sensitive and responsive to unusual information from the clinic rather than waiting for authoritative reports from doctors or officials; (3) be more disruptive to controlling potential epidemics while they are in their early stages rather than trying to comfort the public; and (4) more frequently conduct targeted and effective parades to improve public awareness of pandemics and to improve the timing and mechanism of public response.
The COVID-19 outbreak caused by the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus at the end of December 2019.
In less than two months, it had spread throughout China and to some 50 other countries around the world at the time of this writing.
As the virus is very similar to SARS-CoV and the symptoms are also similar between COVID-19 and SARS, the COVID-19 outbreak has created a feeling that SARS is replicating.
However, there are significant differences between COVID-19 and SARS, which are important for controlling the epidemic and treating patients.
COVID-19 affects more young people and more men than women, and the severity and mortality rate are also higher among older people than among young people.
SARS has a higher mortality rate than COVID-19 (10.91% compared to 1.44%).
COVID-19 patients transmit the virus even when they are asymptomatic, while SARS patients transmit it when they become seriously ill, causing a greater problem in controlling the spread of COVID-19 than SARS.
This explains in part why SARS-CoV-2 is spreading much faster and more widely than SARS-CoV.
A routine analysis of SARS-CoV-2 RNA may be positive in some COVID-19 patients.
On the other hand, vaccinated patients may also show positive results when tested for the virus.
These findings greatly increase the risk of the virus spreading.
With rapid progress in COVID-19 research, a few critical issues remain to be addressed, including:
Where does SARS-CoV-2 come from?
Although it was found that there is a 96% similarity in the genetic structure between SARS-CoV-2 and two SARS-like bat-like CoVs, we cannot conclude that SARS-CoV-2 originated from bats.
What interplanetary animal transmitted the virus from the original host, say bats, to humans?
If we do not know the answers to # 1 and 2, we cannot successfully stop the transmission, and the outbreak can get worse at any time.
Although molecular models and biochemical analysis have shown that SARS-CoV-2 adheres to ACE2, how does the virus actually enter the respiratory tract cells and cause mutations that cause the resulting disease?
Does the virus also attach to ACE2 signaling cells in other organs?
Without clear answers to these questions, we cannot achieve a rapid, accurate diagnosis and effective treatment.
How long will the epidemic continue?
How do the genes of a virus change during human-to-human transmission?
Will it be a global pandemic, a pandemic like SARS, or a pandemic like the flu?
It is important but may take some time to search for answers to the above questions and many others.
However, no matter how much it will cost, we have no choice but to stop the epidemic as soon as possible and restore our lives to normal.
Human-to-human origins of the animal-to-human virus of the human coronavirus
Change and adaptation have encouraged the co-evolution of coronavirus (CoVs) and their hosts, including humans, for millennia.
Before 2003, two human CoVs (HCoVs) were known to cause mild illness, such as the common cold.
The outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) have changed the landscape to show how devastating and life-threatening the HCoV infection can be.
The SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in central China in late 2019 again put the CoVs on the spotlight and surprised us with high infectivity but reduced pathogenicity compared to its sister SARS-CoV.
The HCoV disease is a zoonosis and understanding the zoonotic origins of HCoVs can help.
Most HCoVs originate from bats and do not cause disease in bats.
Medium hosts of other HCoVs are also known.
Identifying animal hosts has direct effects on the prevention of human diseases.
Studying host-CoV interaction in animals may provide important insights into the evolution of the human COVID-19.
In this review, we present a summary of the knowledge already available about the seven HCoVs, and will focus on their history of discovery and their zoonotic origin and cross-species transmission.
More importantly, we compare and classify different HCoVs from the point of view of viral mutation and genetic synthesis.
The current 2019 COVID-19 pandemic is discussed in this context.
In addition, the requirements for successful host switching and the effects of the virus' shift to disease severity are also highlighted.
Coronavirus (CoVs) are part of the Coronaviridae family, which consists of a group of isolated, sensitively-positive, single-stranded RNA viruses.
These viruses contain the largest genome of 26 to 32 kilobases among RNA viruses called CoVs because of their crown-like morphology under an electron microscope.
Structurally, the non-component genomes of the CoVs have the same structure.
About three parts of the genome contain two large open reading frames (ORF1a and ORF1b), which are translated into replicase polyproteins of pp1a and pp1ab.
The polyproteins are further processed to form 16 additional unstructured proteins, called nsp1~16.
The rest of the genome contains the ORF structural proteins, including the spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M), and nucleoprotein (N).
The number of list-specific auxiliary proteins also encodes for various lists of CoVs.
Based on the differences in protein sequences, the CoVs are classified into four categories (alpha-CoV, beta-CoV, gamma-CoV and delta-CoV), where the beta-CoV category contains the majority of HCoVs and is divided into four categories (A, B, C and D).
Phylogenetic evidence has shown that bats and mice are the source of alpha-CoVs and beta-CoVs, while birds are the source of gamma-CoVs and delta-CoVs.
For thousands of years, CoVs have been continuously crossing the biological boundaries and many of them have become important pathogens for humans.
To date, seven human CoVs (HCoVs) have been identified.
Among them HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63 are alpha-CoVs.
The other five beta-CoVs include HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and SARS-CoV-2.
HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63 usually cause minor symptoms, such as a common cold and/or diarrhea.
On the other hand, the newly discovered SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 cause severe illness, causing severe lower respiratory tract disease in a large number of patients leading to a high risk of developing acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and other non-pulmonary diseases.
The first strain of HCoV-229E, B814, was isolated from the nasal secretions of patients with the common cold in the mid-1960s.
Since then, more information has been obtained through detailed studies of HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, both of which cause debilitating symptoms.
In fact, it was accepted that the administration of HCoVs was generally harmless until the SARS outbreak.
The 2003 outbreak of SARS is one of the most devastating in modern history, infecting more than 8,000 people and causing nearly 10 percent of deaths.
A decade later, the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) outbreak resulted in an ongoing epidemic in the Arabian Peninsula with occasional outbreaks in other parts of the world.
The 2019 novel HCoV (2019-nCoV), later named SARS-CoV-2, is the causative agent of the ongoing 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, which killed more than 3,120 people and infected more than 91,000 people on March 3, 2020.
The alarm has been sounding and the world should be prepared for the coming SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.
All seven HCoVs have zoonotic origin from bats, mice or domestic animals.
The majority of evidence supports the evolutionary origin of all HCoVs from bats, where the viruses have adapted well and do not cause disease but show many genetic variations.
The COVID-19 pandemic has posed serious medical, scientific, social, and moral challenges in China and the world.
Tracing the zoonotic origins of HCoVs provides a framework for understanding the natural history, dynamics and inhibitory factors of organism jumps.
This may also guide or assist in identifying the cause, mediator and host animal replication of SARS-CoV-2, which will have important implications for preventing future transmission.
In this review we present a summary of zoonotic origin, cross-species transmission and pathogenesis of HCoVs.
In particular, we highlight and discuss the common theme that HCoVs' parent viruses usually do not cause disease in their natural host but cause disease after different organisms are infected with a new host.
We also review the evolutionary trend of HCoVs where increased infectivity often coincides with decreased pathogenicity.
The effects of the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 outbreak are also discussed in this context.
Animal-derived CoVs have been known since the late 1930s.
Before the first isolation of the HCoV-229E strain B814 from the nasal secretions of patients who had received the common cold, different CoVs were isolated from infected animals of various species, including garlic, mouse, cow, pig, cat and dog.
In the last decades, seven HCoVs have been identified.
A brief summary of the history of HCoVs in sequence (Table 1) may be useful and informative.
The first HCoV-229E strain was isolated from the respiratory tract of patients with upper respiratory tract infection in 1966, and was approved to grow in WI-38 lung cell lines.
Patients infected with HCoV-229E had common cold symptoms, including headache, sneezing, malaise, and sore throat, and fever and cough were observed in 10~20% of cases.
Later in 1967, HCoV-OC43 isolated from a tissue and subsequent sequence pathway in the brains of mammalian mice.
The therapeutic properties of HCoV-OC43 appear to be similar to those caused by HCoV-229E, which was symptomatically indistinguishable from infections with other respiratory tract diseases such as influenza A viruses and rhinoviruses.
Both HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 are globally widespread, and are commonly transmitted during the winter season in favorable weather conditions.
Usually, the duration of exposure to the two viruses is less than one week, followed by about 2 weeks of illness.
According to a study of human volunteers, healthy people infected with HCoV-229E experienced a mild flu-like illness.
Only a few patients with depressed immune systems showed severe lower respiratory tract disease.
SARS, also known as rare pneumonia, was the first HCoV-caused pandemic recorded in human history and is the causative agent of SARS-CoV, the third HCoV to be identified.
The first case of SARS that could be traced came in late 2002 in China's Guangdong Province.
The SARS pandemic led to a reported 8,096 cases and 774 deaths, spread over many countries and continents.
In addition to the primary vectors, it was estimated that each case could cause at least two additional cases, with an immunization period of 4 to 7 days and a peak in viral load occurring on the 10th day of illness.
Patients infected with SARS-CoV initially appeared to suffer from myalgia, headache, fever, malaise and fever, followed by dyspnea, coughing and shortness of breath as later symptoms.
Lymphopenia, poor liver function tests, and elevated creatine kinase are among the common laboratory abnormalities caused by SARS.
The spread of alveolar damage, the clotting of the epithelial cell and the increase of macrophages have been observed in SARS patients.
About 20-30% of patients require intensive care and ventilation.
In addition to the lower respiratory tract, many organs including the gastrointestinal tract, liver, and kidneys may also be infected by these critical conditions, often accompanied by a cytokine storm, which can be fatal especially in patients with compromised immune systems.
The virus was first isolated in the open lung surgery of a relative of the first patient who traveled to Hong Kong from Guangzhou.
Since then, major efforts have been made in relation to HCoV research.
HCoV-NL63 was isolated in a 7-month-old Dutch infant in late 2004.
It was first found to be common in young children, the elderly, and patients with compromised immune systems with respiratory diseases.
The presence of choryza, conjunctivitis, fever, and bronchiolitis is common in the disease caused by HCoV-NL63.
Another independent study described the isolation of the same virus from the nasal mucosa of an eight-month-old boy suffering from pneumonia in the Netherlands.
Although it was invented in the Netherlands, it has actually spread around the world.
It has been estimated that HCoV-NL63 accounts for about 4.7% of common respiratory illnesses, with its peak incidence occurring in early summer, spring, and winter.
HCoV-NL63 is associated with obstructive laryngitis, also known as croup.
In the same year, HCoV-HKU1 was isolated from a 71-year-old man who was hospitalized with pneumonia and bronchiolitis in Hong Kong.
In addition to community-acquired pneumonia and bronchiolitis, HCoV-HKU1 was reported to be associated with acute asthmatic exacerbation.
Like HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 was found worldwide, causing minor respiratory illnesses.
All of these community-acquired HCoVs have adapted well to humans and are generally less likely to mutate into highly pathogenic diseases, although the accidents occur for unknown reasons such as in the rare case of the highly lethal subtype HCoV-NL63, which has been reported to cause severe lower respiratory tract disease in China.
In general, when these HCoVs acquire the ability to easily infect and persist in the human body, they are also lethal or less pathogenic.
MERS-CoV was first isolated in 2012 in the lungs of a 60-year-old patient suffering from severe pneumonia and renal failure in Saudi Arabia.
Although most laboratory-confirmed cases originate in the Middle East, imported cases are spreading to nearby contacts reported in various European countries and Tunisia.
A second outbreak occurred in South Korea in 2015, with 186 confirmed cases.
The medical appearance of MERS is similar to that of SARS, which is characterized by progressive acute pneumonia.
Unlike SARS, many MERS patients suffered from severe renal failure, which is currently the only exception to MERS among HCoV-caused infections.
More than 30 percent of patients have gastrointestinal symptoms, such as diarrhea and vomiting.
As of February 14, 2020, more than 2500 laboratory-confirmed cases have been reported with a high mortality rate of 34.4%, making MERS-CoV one of the most dangerous viruses for humans.
From mid-December 2019 to late December 2019, a number of patients with pneumonia known to be related to SARS-CoV-2 disease were detected in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
The World Health Organization has designated the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern and has named the disease COVID-19.
As of March 3, 2020, there were 90,053 confirmed cases reported worldwide, with a mortality rate of 3.4%.
Significantly, the death rate in Hubei, China, is 4.2 percent, while the other is 1.2 percent.
SARS-CoV-2 causes acute respiratory illness similar to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which has been characterized as fever, cough and dyspnea.
Patients also suffer from diarrhea.
Pneumonia is one of the most serious symptoms and can quickly progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome.
Although SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are very similar due to the similarity of the high 82% nucleotide sequence structure, there are distinct groups in the branches of the phylogenetic tree.
SARS-CoV-2 appears to be less pathogenic but more transmissible compared to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
There have been reports of asymptomatic cases of SARS-CoV-2 and they may be contributing to its rapid spread worldwide.
Comparison and isolation of SARS-CoV-2 with six other HCoVs reveals very interesting similarities and differences.
First, the incubation period and duration of HCoV infection are very similar.
In this regard, SARS-CoV-2 follows the normal trend of six other HCoVs.
Second, the severity of COVID-19 symptoms is between SARS-CoV and the four HCoVs identified in the community (i.e. HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63).
On the other hand, SARS-CoV-2 infection exhibits characteristics commonly seen during community-acquired HCoV infections, including the absence of clear, mild or no symptoms.
On the other hand, a small subset of COVID-19 critical cases can also be identified as SARS-CoV infection, although the rate is slightly lower.
Third, SARS-CoV-2 infection also shows interesting characteristic patterns of both community-acquired HCoVs and SARS-CoV.
On the other hand, transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is as high as that of HCoVs found in the population.
On the other hand, it remains to be established whether transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is reduced in humans as in the case of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Finally, like other HCoVs, SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in wild samples.
Whether oral transmission of SARS-CoV-2 plays a significant role in SARS-CoV under certain conditions remains to be determined by future studies.
It is also of great interest to see whether SARS-CoV-2 will show seasonal emergence as is the case with HCoVs found in the community.
However, the characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 including its infectivity, pathogenicity and sustained spread after transmission to humans will influence the final conclusion of a further COVID-19 outbreak.
All HCoVs found in the community cause mild symptoms and adapt well to humans.
According to one theory, it may also be true that humans have adapted well to these four HCoVs.
In other words, both may have survived the ancient HCoV pandemic.
HCoVs cause serious human diseases and people with serious HCoV infections are no longer present.
For this to happen, HCoVs must replicate in humans at sufficient rates to allow the growth of adaptive mutations that counter the host's limiting features.
In this way, if the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak persists and infects more people, there will be a greater chance that it will adapt more to humans.
If it adapts well enough, its transmission to humans may be difficult to prevent by quarantine or other infection control measures.
For years, four COVID-19 viruses have been detected in the community circulating in the human community, causing a common cold in people with a proper immune response.
These microbes do not need an animal source.
In contrast, the highly pathogenic SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV have not adapted well to humans and their transmission within humans cannot be sustained.
They need to keep themselves in shape and grow from their zoonotic source and seek the opportunity to move on to potential victims, possibly with one or more intermediate hosts and be raised by hosts.
SARS-CoV-2 has similar characteristics to both SARS-CoV/MERS-CoV and the four HCoVs found in the community.
It is as infectious as HCoVs found in the community, at least in the first organism.
However, it is more pathogenic than HCoVs found in the community and has less pathogenicity to SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV.
Whether it will fully adapt to humans and move around without a fountain or a central animal host remains to be seen.
Before discussing the animal origin of HCoVs, it will be helpful to discuss the definitions and characteristics of mutant, natural, source, intermediate and amplifier hosts of HCoVs.
An animal becomes a host for HCoV mutation if it has a closely related ancestor with which it shares a high homology at the nucleotide sequence level.
The ancestral virus usually adapts well and does not cause disease in the host.
Similarly, the source host carries the HCoV continuously and for a long time.
In both cases, hosts are naturally infected and are natural hosts of the HCoV or its parent virus.
In contrast, if HCoV is reintroduced to a central host prior to or near introduction to humans, it does not adapt well to the new host and often causes illness.
This central host may be a zoonotic source of human infection and play the role of a host reproducer allowing the virus to temporarily replicate and be transmitted to humans to increase the rate of human infection.
The HCoV may experience a final infection if it cannot maintain its infection within the host medium.
In contrast, HCoVs are able to adapt to a medium host and even establish long-term endemicity.
In this case, the intermediate host becomes the natural source host.
Epidemiological data showed that in retrospect the SARS-indicator patient had a history of contact with prey.
Subsequent seroprevalence studies showed that animal traders had higher IgG resistance to SARS-CoV compared to the general population.
Masked palm civets (paguma larvata) and racoon dogs in live animal markets were found to carry SARS-CoV-like viruses that are nearly identical to SARS-CoV.
This was indirectly supported by the fact that no additional SARS was reported after all the civets in the markets had been killed.
However, it has been reported that masked palm civets in the wild or on farms that have never been exposed to live animal markets were positive for SARS-CoV, suggesting that masked palm civets may be a medium breeding host but not a natural source of SARS-CoV.
It is noteworthy, that with 80% of the various animals in the Guangzhou market having antibodies against SARS-CoV, we cannot ignore the possibility that many mammals are intermediate breeding hosts of SARS-CoV.
All of these appear to be the final hosts of SARS-CoV.
Subsequent studies of the SARS-CoV host animal identified a closely related bat-likeCoV, called SARS-related Rhinolophus bat CoV HKU3 (SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3), which is found in Chinese horseshoe bats.
These bats are positive in terms of antibodies against SARS-CoV and the sequence of the SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3 gene.
This and other bat-CoVs share 88-92% of the nucleotide sequence homology with SARS-CoV.
These studies have led to the development of a new theory that bats can host new pathogens on humans.
SARS-like CoVs (SL-CoVs) have been identified in bats, but none other than the so-called WIV1 can be classified as a live virus.
The human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is known to be a SARS-CoV receptor.
WIV1 taken from bat feces samples was shown to use bat, civet, and human ACE2 as a cell-entry response.
Interestingly, the serum of patients recovering from SARS was able to kill WIV1.
To date, WIV1 represents a closely related ancestor of SARS-CoV in bats, sharing 95% of the nucleotide sequence homology.
Although there is high homology between the two viruses, it is generally believed that WIV1 is not the immediate parent virus of SARS-CoV and bats are not the immediate hosts of SARS-CoV.
Phylogenetic analysis includes MERS-CoV and the same group as bat-CoV-HKU4 and bat-CoV-HKU5.
Bat-HKU4 and MERS-CoV use the same mosquito receptor, dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), for viral entry.
The RNA-dependent RNA polymerase sequence of MERS-CoV is phylogenetically close to the beta-CoVs of bats found in Europe and Africa.
To date, no live MERS-CoV has been found in wild bats.
MERS-CoV and its close relative bat-CoV-HKU25 share only 87% of the nucleotide sequence homology.
As a result, bats may not be the nearest host to MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, studies in the Middle East have shown that dromedary camels are seropositive to the antibodies that directly kill MERS-CoV, similar to camels originating in the Middle East in many African countries.
A live MERS-CoV-like virus found in humans was isolated from the nasal swab of dromedary camels, further proving that camels are the true host source of MERS-CoV.
It is also noteworthy that small but large viral release was often observed in camels infected with MERS-CoV according to the study.
Significantly, infected camels not only expel the germs through the respiratory tract but also through the oral tract, which is also the primary route of release of the bacteria from bats.
However, questions remain as most MERS cases have no history of contact with camels before the onset of symptoms, possible human-to-human transmission or unknown transmission routes involving unknown animals carrying MERS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 shares a 96.2% nucleotide homology with the bat-specific RaTG13CoV isolated from Rhinolophus affinis bats.
As with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the sequence variance between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is too large to be assigned to a parent relationship.
That is, bats are not likely to be the immediate source host of SARS-CoV-2 unless near-identical bat-CoVs are detected in the future.
It is suspected that, hosts of the SARS-CoV-2 animal vector should be among the wild animals sold and killed at the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, most of which were related to the initial illness of COVID-19, suggesting that there may have been an episode of animal-to-human transmission.
Several recent studies based on metagenomic sequencing have suggested that a group of small mammals known as pangolins (Manis javanica) may have been infected with older SARS-CoV-2 related beta-CoVs.
These new pangolin CoV genomes share 85-92% of the nucleotide sequence homology with SARS-CoV-2.
However, they are equally closely related to RaTG13 with an identifier of about 90% at the nucleotide sequence level.
They are grouped into two sub-classes of viruses that are nearly identical to SARS-CoV-2 in the phylogenetic tree, one of which shares a very similar receptor binding domain (RBD) with SARS-CoV-2, and 97.4% amino acid sequence similarity.
In contrast, the RBDs of SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 are very different, although there is a high degree of genome-wide sequence homology.
Previous studies of diseased pangolins reported the detection of viral contigs in lung samples, which appear to be similarly related to SARS-CoV-2.
The study used various engineering techniques and manual editing to construct a partial genome sequence that makes up about 86.3% of the total length of the virus genome.
We cannot rule out the possibility that pangolins are one of the closest hosts of SARS-CoV-2.
However, there is currently no evidence to support the claim that pangolin is the direct origin of SARS-CoV-2 due to sequence differences between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2 pangolin related beta-CoVs.
Furthermore, the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is even shorter between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2 pangolin-related beta-CoVs.
The evolutionary pathway of SARS-CoV-2 in bats, pangolins and other mammals is yet to be discovered.
Although high sequence homology has been found in RBDs between SARS-CoV-2 and pangolin, SARS-CoV-2 related beta-CoVs, SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 share high sequence homology across the genome.
There is a high suspicion that the high degree of similarity between the RBDs of SARS-CoV-2 pangolin-related beta-CoVs and SARS-CoV-2 is driven by selectively interacting interspecies evolution.
Another proposal recommends a recombination between beta-CoV-related pangolin SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 in a third wild animal.
As the driving force of evolution, recombination is widespread among beta-CoVs.
No conclusion has yet been reached regarding the zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2.
In addition to highly pathogenic HCoVs, the zoonotic origin of HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1 has also been investigated.
Phylogenetic evidence has shown that both HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E may have originated in bat-CoVs, while the parent viruses of HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 were found in mice.
A bat-CoV called ARCoV.2 (Appalachian Ridge CoV) detected in a North American three-colored bat was reported to show close association with HCoV-NL63.
On the other hand, HCoV-229E was genetically related to another bat-CoV, called Hipposideros/GhanaKwam/19/2008, which was detected in Ghana, while camellias have been suspected of being its closest host.
For clarity, current information regarding the animal origin of known HCoVs is summarized in Figure 1 and Table 2.
Phylogenetic analysis has provided evidence of HCoV infection events in history.
When HCoV-OC43 was transferred from one animal to humans from domestic animals around 1890, an outbreak of respiratory disease was recorded.
The transmission history of the different strains of HCoV-229E is not very clear.
Bat-related alpha-CoVs have been identified with HCoV-229E.
Among them is the alpaca alpha-CoV.
Few evidence supports transmission of the virus from bats to humans directly.
First, humans, not alpacas, may have been in contact with bats in the same environment.
Rather, humans are closely allied with alpacas.
Second, the HCoV-229E-related bat alpha-CoVs are distinct and do not cause disease in bats, while the alpaca alpha-CoV caused respiratory outbreaks in infected animals.
Finally, alpaca alpha-CoV has not been detected in wildlife.
As a result, we cannot ignore the possibility that alpacas may contract HCoV-229E-related alpha-CoVs in humans.
In fact, bats are a direct source of human disease viruses, including rabies, Ebola, Nipah, and Hendra.
It is therefore not surprising that bats may transmit HCoV-229E directly to humans.
On the other hand, where bat alpha-CoVs act as a cluster of HCoV-229E genes, alpacas and dromedary camels may be the intermediate hosts transmitting the virus to humans, as is the case with MERS-CoV.
MERS-CoV is a good example of the transmission of different organisms from bats to dromedary camels to humans.
The evolutionary origin of MERS-CoV from bats is known from its initial diagnosis and confirmed by subsequent findings.
Apparently, bats provide a variety of bacteria with the opportunity for genetic exchange between different animals and for transmission between different animals.
Longevity, dense colonies, close social ties, and strong flight abilities are all good conditions for bats to be a good "virus-spreader".
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has been introduced to dromedary camels for centuries.
It is well adapted to these camels that have turned from a median host to a stable, natural host.
MERS-CoV causes less disease and has a low rate of mutation in these animals.
Its transmission to humans is erroneous and humans remain the final host of MERS-CoV as its transmission cannot be sustained.
Unlike the role of camels in MERS-CoV transmission, the role of pangolins, if any, in SARS-CoV-2 transmission is distinct.
In particular, beta-CoVs in pangolins cause severe illness in pangolins.
They may be the final host of SARS-CoV-2 related beta-CoVs, similar to civets in the case of SARS-CoV.
The few possibilities of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 viruses from animals to humans should be considered or not considered in future studies.
First, bats may be the host source of the SARS-CoV-2 related virus that is nearly identical to SARS-CoV-2.
Humans may play a role similar to bats in the slaughter of animals or the mining of coal.
Second, pangolins may be the central breeding host where the SARS-CoV-2 related virus has recently been introduced.
People are infected by surgeries and by eating prey.
It is possible that many mammals including domestic animals may be exposed to SARS-CoV-2.
An animal and wildlife immunoassay is required.
Third, as mentioned above, the recombination and adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 may have occurred in a third animal that has come in contact with both bats and pangolins.
The search for an animal origin of SARS-CoV-2 is ongoing.
In addition to the various types of animal hosts, there are three major factors on the viral side that are important in making CoVs cross the species boundary.
First, their high rate of change in RNA replication.
Compared to other single-stranded RNA viruses, the rate of mutation of the CoVs may be considered low to high at a rate of ~10-4 mutations per year per 2nd site, depending on the stage of adaptation of the CoV to the new hosts.
CoVs have a fault-finding exoribonuclease, the removal of which results in extreme mutations and decreased potency or inability to grow properly.
Interestingly, the nucleotide analogue Remdesivir is known to inhibit the replication of the COVID by inhibition of this exoribonuclease and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase.
Remdesivir is one of the most promising anti-SARS-CoV-2 agents to be tested in clinical trials.
However, the rate of COVID mutations is about one million times higher than the previous host.
In addition, the rate of mutation is often high if the CoVs are not well adapted to the host.
Compared to SARS-CoV with a high mutation rate, SARS-CoV-2 mutation rate appears to be low, suggesting a high degree of human adaptation.
It is thought that it may already have been reconciled with another host close to the people.
In addition to SARS-CoV-2, this also applies to MERS-CoV, which is well adapted to dromedary camels.
It is thought to be almost impossible that genetic mutations could cause vaccines and antiviral drugs against SARS-CoV-2 to fail immediately.
Second, the large RNA genome in CoVs uses more flexibility in genome modification for modification and recombination, thereby increasing the chance of co-evolution of diverse organisms, which is beneficial for the emergence of new CoVs when conditions are appropriate.
This is supported by many different open reading frames and functional proteins produced by the 3′ termination of the genome.
Third, the remaining CoVs change templates randomly during RNA replication in a different selective-copy manner.
In a host that acts as a mixing vessel, species change occurs regularly during transcription of the COVID RNA.
Highly homologous full-length and subgenomic RNAs may recombine to form new COVs.
Phyllogenetic evidence of genetic recombination has been found in both HCoV-HKU1, HCoV-OC43, and animal-derived CoVs such as bat SL-CoV and batCoV-HKU9.
Virus-host interaction with regard to infection
Besides the three bacterial features mentioned above, the interaction of the virus with the host's host is another major factor that influences the transmission of heterogeneous organisms.
Here, the recombination of SARS-CoV is considered a common example, which demonstrates evidence of positive selection during the incidence of multiple infections.
Based on comparative analysis between isolated humans and civet SARS-CoVs, it is hypothesized that SARS-CoV undergoes rapid adaptation to different hosts, particularly through changes in RBD of the S protein.
In general, RBD in the S protein of the COVID-19 interacts with the cell's receptor and is strongly selective for host immune response.
In SARS-CoV, RBD is a 318 to 510 amino acid in the S1 subunit, which binds to human ACE2 and its coreceptors to enter the virus.
The RBD for SARS-CoV is able to detect the ACE2 responses of different animals, including bats, civets, mice and raccoon dogs, allowing for transmission of the virus to different organisms.
In fact, only 6 amino acid residues were observed to be distinct from human and civet virus isolation in RBD of which 4 are found in the motif that adheres to the receptor to interact with the ACE2 receptor.
Civet SARS-CoV has K479N and S487T mutations in its RBD, which may increase the degree of spike protein interaction with the human ACE2 receptor.
In other words, this change in the two amino acids may be important for the adaptation of the virus to humans.
It is noteworthy that SARS-CoV-2 has the same cellular response as SARS-CoV.
The 30% difference between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV in the S1 unit of the S protein means that the degree of interaction of the S protein with human ACE2 may have changed.
In fact, cryo-EM studies show a 10 - to 20-fold higher rate of this coagulation than between human ACE2 and the SARS-CoV S protein.
It will also be interesting to determine whether another coreceptor is needed for SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Interestingly, HCoV-NL63 also binds to ACE2 but with a different S-terminus.
There are other HCoV reagents, such as aminopeptidase N for HCoV-229E, and 9-O-acetylated sialic acid for HCoV-OC43.
It may also be considered a factor in the successful adaptation of CoVs to humans after the transmission of different organisms from their animal hosts.
In addition to non-cellular responses, the effect of different organisms' infection with HCoVs is also controlled by organism dependence and limit factors.
The differences in these host proteins between humans and natural HCoV-providing hosts such as bats, dromedary camels and mice may cause a barrier to cross-species transmission.
HCoVs must take on host-dependent features and disrupt host-inhibitory features for successful organismal transmission.
In this regard, the molecular determinants in this vital host-to-virus area are yet to be identified and characterized.
A broad non-biased genome-wide screening of host-dependent and restrictive features of SARS-CoV-2 using modern CRISPR technology may be beneficial.
New HCoV outbreaks: back to the beginning
Variation of bat-CoVs provides more opportunities for the emergence of new HCoVs.
In this sense, bat-CoVs act as a collection of HCoVs genes.
In addition, rapid mutation and recombination of genes also drive HCoV evolution and serve as two important steps in this process.
For example, the discovery or loss of genes that code for a new protein has the potential to dramatically alter the phenotypes of a virus.
Among the SARS-CoV helper proteins, ORF8 is thought to be important in human adaptation, as SARS-CoV-related bat viruses are isolated but found to produce distinct ORF8 proteins.
The 29-nucleotide-depositive property of SARS-CoVs was found in isolated strains early in the human epidemic.
This deletion cleaves ORF8 into ORF8a and ORF8b and is thought to be an adaptive mutation that promotes host switching.
In addition, SARS-CoV may have a history of recombination with alpha and gamma-CoVs, where a large number of small recombination sites in RNA-dependent RNA polymerase have been identified.
Reassembly sites were also found in nsp9, most nsp10, and parts of nsp14.
Similarly, it has been shown that the MERS-CoV pandemic experienced incidents of recombination between different strains, which occurred in dromedary camels in Saudi Arabia.
Apart from SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, recombination events have been observed in other HCoVs, where HCoVs recombine with other animal-derived CoVs in their non-structural genes.
It should also be noted that artificial selection may contribute to unintended mutations in the virus' genomes, which may result in the release of the virus from applied selective pressures, such as those of the host's immune system.
An example of these effects is the loss of full-length ORF4 in the HCoV-229E prototype strain, due to the removal of two nucleotides.
Although complete ORF4 was detected in bat and camel HCoV-229E-related viruses, alpaca alpha-CoV shows single nucleotide insertion, leading to frame mutation.
Last but not least, the evolution of new HCoVs is also driven by pressure to select from its source hosts.
There were no or only minor symptoms detected when bats were infected with CoVs, indicating similarity between CoVs and bats.
It appears that bats are well adapted to COVs in terms of structure and function.
For example, the disruption of the use of inflammatory response in bats easily reduces the pathology induced by CoVs.
Besides, the activity of the natural killer cell in bats is suppressed by the increased NKG2/CD94 natural killer cell inhibitory response and the low expression of the stage I histocompatibility complex.
Furthermore, the high level of oxygen-reactive organisms (ROS) generated by the high-throughput digestion activity of bats may affect both the suppression of the replication of the COVID and affect the detection of defects with exoribonuclease, thereby providing selective pressure for the development of highly pathogenic bacterial species when introduced to a new host.
Highly pathogenic variants of theCoV may also mutate by recombination, leading to the discovery of new proteins or protein characteristics for host adaptation.
As a result, it is not just a coincidence that three new HCoVs have appeared in the last two decades.
CoVs do not infect or cause minor symptoms in their primary hosts such as bats and camels.
They recur rapidly without stimulating a strong immune response.
Here are the secrets of why asymptomatic carriers are detected and what causes the most serious cases of human disease.
The most severe symptoms are primarily due to over-activation of the immune system and a cytokine storm in which there is a strong immune response, the damage to the lungs being more severe.
In contrast, in those who do not show symptoms, the immune response has been divided into two for the recurrence of theCoV.
The same classification strategy for immune response may have beneficial effects in the treatment against SARS-CoV-2.
The interferon response is particularly strong in bats.
Therefore, the use of type I interferon at least in the early stages of SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans should be beneficial.
Furthermore, the use of the NLRP3 inflammasome in bats is not effective.
According to this hypothesis, inhibition of the NLRP3 inflammasome by MCC950 may be useful in the treatment of COVID-19.
SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks follow the common theme of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV outbreaks.
Although a bat beta-CoV has been identified that shares 95% of the nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV, there is also a bat-CoV that shares 96% of the nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV-2.
Although civets and other market animals have been found to carry SARS-CoV-like viruses, the closest intermediate hosts of SARS-CoV-2 have not been identified.
Beta-CoVs of pangolins have been identified with similar structure to SARS-CoV-2, suggesting that pangolins may be other intermediate hosts or beta-CoVs of pangolins may contribute to the genetic components in the final version of SARS-CoV-2.
Although questions remain, there is no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 was deliberately or accidentally synthesized by humans.
CoVs have returned to the scene due to the recent SARS-CoV-2 outbreak.
Research into CoVs in bats and other animals has significantly changed our view of the importance of zoonotic and animal sources of HCoVs in human transmission.
Widespread evidence suggests that SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are of bat origin and are transmitted to humans by intermediate hosts.
Since SARS-CoV infection is from human-civet contact in markets, closing live animal markets and killing civets could end the SARS epidemic.
In a similar vein, pangolins should be removed from organic markets to prevent zoonotic infection, given the detection of multiple lists of pangolin beta-CoVs closely related to SARS-CoV-2.
However, whether and how SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted to humans by pangolins and other mammals remains to be determined in future studies.
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has been present in dromedary camels for a long time.
These camels are an important means of transportation and the main source of meat, honey, leather, and wool products for the local people.
They are widespread in the Middle East and Africa.
It is therefore impossible to kill all camels to control MERS, as is done in wildlife markets in China to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
To prevent recurrent outbreaks of MERS, a detailed approach should be used to develop effective vaccines against camel MERS-CoV, along with other disease control measures.
Since we cannot eliminate these viruses, new genotypes may emerge to cause outbreaks.
Varieties of zoonotic CoVs are circulating in the desert.
In particular, the zoonotic potential of bat-CoVs is highly variable.
There is a high probability that these zoonotic CoVs will mutate and recombine, resulting in new CoVs that are more transmissible and/or lethal to humans in the future.
The tradition of eating wild animals in some parts of China should be abandoned to reduce unnecessary contact between humans and animals.
With the cases of SARS, MERS and COVID-19, there should be the best preparedness and response system.
In fact, many bacteria have been around for a long time.
They remain in their natural habitat until they have a chance to escape.
Although bats have many features that promote the spread of germs, the chance of human contact with bats and other wildlife can be reduced if people are taught to beware of them.
Continued monitoring of mammals is necessary to better understand the ecology of CoVs and their natural hosts, which will be helpful in preventing animal-to-human infection and future outbreaks.
In conclusion, the best way to prevent zoonotic germs is to keep people away from the natural sources of zoonotic germs.
A few pieces of the puzzle of the zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2 have not been discovered.
First, if bats transmit the ancestral SARS-CoV-2 virus to pangolins, it will be useful to see under what conditions bats and pangolins cannot share similar environments.
Second, if bats play a more direct role in human infection, it is necessary to find out how humans communicate with bats.
Third, if a mammal acts as a true intermediate host, its interactions with various creatures, including humans, bats, and pangolins, should be clarified.
Finally, as many mammals including pets may be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2, both surveillance and infection research should be undertaken.
If it is a bat, a pangolin or another mammal, it is expected that SARS-CoV-2 or its parent viruses will be nearly identical in their natural host in the future.
Further research in this area will explain the evolutionary pathway of SARS-CoV-2 in animals, and the important implications for the prevention and control of COVID-19 in humans.
A review of the diagnostic criteria for those who are suspected and confirmed to have COVID-19 is required.
On 6 February 2020, our team had published a quick advice guide for the diagnosis and treatment of the 2019 novel coronavirus infection (2019-nCoV), and this guide provided our experience and made a proper reference to combating the global pandemic.
However, the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is a new disease, our vigilance and understanding is increasing based on ongoing research and experience in treatment procedures; therefore, diagnostic and treatment strategies are continuously being updated.
In this letter, we responded to one comment regarding our guide and provided a new identification criteria for those who are suspected and confirmed to be ill according to the Diagnosis and Treatment Guidelines for COVID-19 (seventh edition) issued by the National Health Committee of the Peoples Republic of China.
In December 2019, the novel 2019 (2019-nCoV) coronavirus had caused an outbreak, now officially called coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and the virus was named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
On 11 March 2020, WHO referred to COVID-19 as a pandemic.
To combat SARS-CoV-2 infection, our team developed a rapid response guide and published it online in Military Medical Research on 06 February 2020.
It has received much attention since its publication.
Be aware, however, that COVID-19 is a new disease, and surveillance and knowledge about it is increasingly based on research findings and medical experience; therefore, diagnostic and treatment strategies are continually being updated.
For example, the Diagnosis and Treatment Guidelines for COVID-19 issued by the National Health Committee of the People's Republic of China (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/), between 16 January 2020 and 3 March 2020, has issued seven volumes in which some elements have been significantly modified.
Our guide received a comment from Zhou et al., presenting a simple suggestion of points based on their experience.
Their work adds new evidence of our pioneering and makes important references to the pandemic worldwide.
We commend their important work and express our gratitude.
However, their work needs to be reviewed in line with the latest Diagnosis and Treatment Guidelines for COVID-19 (Seventh Edition of the study) and the latest research.
According to the seventh edition (3 March 2020), to confirm a suspected disease it is necessary to meet either one of the epidemiological history factors and two clinical indications for a comprehensive analysis, or it needs to meet three clinical indications that do not have a clear epidemiological history:
epidemiological history: (1) history of visiting or living in Wuhan city and surrounding areas, or other communities where COVID-19 infection has been reported in the past 14 days before the onset of symptoms; (2) history of contact with people infected with SARS-CoV-2 (positive nucleic acid testing); (3) history of contact with patients with fever or respiratory symptoms in Wuhan city and surrounding areas, or other communities where COVID-19 has been reported in the 14 days before the onset of symptoms; (4) history of contact with multiple confirmed cases (≥ 2 patients with fever and/or respiratory symptoms within 2 weeks, such as in offices, homes, schools, classrooms, etc.).
Medical signs: (1) fever and/ or respiratory symptoms; (2) with features typical of COVID-19 infection; (3) total white blood cell count indicating normal, decreased, or reduced lymphocyte count in the first stage.
A confirmed diagnosis should be based on suspected disease with at least one of the following pathogenic or serological evidence: (1) positive real-time PCR test for SARS-CoV-2; (2) complete virus genome sequencing showing high homogeneity in known viruses of the novel coronavirus; (3) positive for specific IgM and IgG antibodies for SARS-CoV-2 in serum testing; or positive for a change in specific IgG antibodies for SARS-CoV-2 from a fracture to a net, or a release of ≥4 times the critical stage.
We note that real-time PCR testing of nucleic acid in the respiratory tract or blood samples has been added in the second (18 January 2020) and third (22 January 2020) programmes.
Pathogenic detection of blood sample was added in the fourth (27 January 2020) and fifth (8 February 2020) editions; and serological evidence was included in the seventh edition.
These changes are based on the ongoing work of researchers to find a high-nucleic acid rapid diagnostic kit, and respiratory tract samples including a blood sample, which increased the availability of different tissues, and supported the delivery of a positive antibody effect in a confirmed case.
Besides, there is additional evidence to remind us to be on guard against patients with unusual symptoms and those without symptoms.
Therefore, the flow chart of Zhou et al. should be revised, as it refers to a person without symptoms  as low risk.
The score system also needs to be confirmed at work and in continuing medical courses.
In conclusion, we hope that more evidence is forthcoming and ask readers to comment.
To make the diagnosis of both suspected and confirmed illnesses, we recommend that the latest guidelines for countries be followed and followed in their home.
Our team will also review our guide to provide assistance.
Bangladesh reports five new COVID-19 deaths, the highest number of a day
Yesterday, Bangladesh confirmed five new deaths from COVID-19 on the same day.
This is the highest number of day-long infections ever recorded.
As of yesterday, Bangladesh's Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research (IEDCR) reported a reported 114 cases and 33 recoveries from home.
A total of 17 deaths have been recorded.
In an online news forum, IEDCR director, Dr. Meerjady Sabrina Flora, said the dead included four men and one woman.
According to Dr. Meerjady, two were over the age of 60, two were between 51 and 60, and one was between 41-50.
He also said that two were from Dhaka.
The World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 to be a pandemic on March 11.
The hospital official told Anadolu Agency, a local news source, that one of the dead was Jalal Saifur Rahman, director of the Bengali Anti-Corruption Commission, who was treated at Kuwait Maitree Hospital.
On Saturday, in a video announcement, the Bangladeshi Minister of Road Transport Obaidul Quader said that public transport will be closed for longer than planned, until this coming Saturday.
The public transportation closure began on March 26 and was scheduled to end on Saturday, April 4.
The transportation of essential goods - medical supplies, fuel and food - is still prohibited.
The first recorded cases of COVID-19 infection in Bangladesh were on March 8, in two people returning from Italy and the wife of one of them.
By March 19, the three had already recovered.
The number of SARS-CoV-2 infections exceeds one million worldwide
On Thursday, the total number of people infected with the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus exceeded one million worldwide, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.
At least 52,000 deaths were linked to COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus.
This happened on the same day that Malawi confirmed its first coronavirus-related case and Zambia had its first coronavirus-related death.
North Korea said, as of Thursday, it is one of the few countries free of coronavirus infection.
Yesterday, the World Health Organization reported 1,051,635 confirmed cases, including 79,332 cases in the twenty-four hours before 10 a.m. Central European (0800 UTC) on April 4.
In the United States, more than 244,000 cases of the coronavirus have been recorded, associated with nearly 5,900 deaths.
CBS News reported, citing data from Johns Hopkins University, that there were more than 1,000 deaths in the US on Wednesday caused by coronavirus infections.
Around the world, countries have announced strong measures to prevent the spread of the disease.
On Thursday, Sergei Sobyanin, the mayor of Moscow, extended the city lockdown until May 1.
Nationwide, President Vladimir Putin has announced that Russians will continue to be on strike until April 30.
Portugal's parliament voted to extend the national emergency for 15 days; the vote was passed by 215 votes in favour, 10 against, and one abstention.
Saudi Arabia extended curfews in the holy cities of Mecca and Medina to extend throughout the day; previously, curfews were between 3 p.m. and 6 a.m.
Thailand plans to implement a curfew between 10 p.m. and 4 a.m.
Ohio's governor, Mike DeWine, has announced that the state has extended its curfew until May 1.
Stores in Australia lowered the limit on the purchase of small household paper per purchase
On Sunday and Saturday nights, the Australian supermarket chains Woolworths and Coles lowered their purchase limit of toilet paper to two and one pack per purchase at each store nationwide, respectively.
ALDI also introduced a one-pack limit, on Monday.
These restrictions are posted as checkout messages, and on the store's Facebook pages.
Consumers have been continuing to buy more of it out of fear of COVID-19 in case they need to quarantine.
On Wednesday, Woolworths also reduced the purchase of toilet paper for those who were delivered home to one pack per order.
These changes follow the previous four-pack limit for each purchase introduced by Woolworths and Coles on March 4 and 5.
"Coles, in its March 8 press release, reported that with the four-pack limit set, ""many stores are still out of stock about an hour after delivery"", and called the need ""unprecedented"", while ALDI, in its Facebook post Tuesday, said ""unexpected"""."
"Sales ""surged"" last week, according to a Woolworths spokesman".
Costco's Canberra store also cut the allowance to two packs last week.
To cope with the shortage, Coles ordered larger packages from suppliers and announced increased deliveries, Woolworths ordered more stock, while ALDI made stock for the scheduled Wednesday special available immediately.
Russell Zimmerman, executive director of the Australian Retailers Association, said retailers are trying to increase inventory, but local council restrictions on the delivery time of trucks are complicating matters.
He expects production costs to rise, as suppliers try to meet demand, with few offers.
On Tuesday, ALDI announced that because of the early release of stock, some stores could not continue with the Wednesday special.
In a report on News.com.au, Dr. Gary Mortimer, a marketing specialist at the Queensland University of Technology, said that stores fill up the stock every night.
He noted that small-scale paper is a heavy material, which results in a low stock-to-value ratio, and, when it is exhausted, leaves a large space open, which reinforces the feeling of being adorable.
Coles and Woolworths are of the opinion [that] if there were more items on the shelves, if a product such as paper rolls and a sanitary pad could be [bought] and available in bulk, you could probably reduce the panic, says Russell Zimmerman according to ABC News.
The manufacturer of recycled toilet paper Who Gives a Crap said on Wednesday that they were out of stock.
Kimberly-Clark, which makes Kleenex Toilet Tissue, and Solaris Paper, which makes Sorbent, stressed that they work 24/7 to keep the product up, according to a News.com.au report.
Domain.com, a real estate website, reported that some real estate agents are giving free paper to the first bidder at Melbourne auctions, when a few auctions are held because buyers have time off for Labor Day weekend.
Thursday's edition of NT News, Darwin's daily newspaper, included an appendix with nine pages intended to be cut and used as toilet paper.
Stores were initially reluctant to impose restrictions, according to a report by ABC Australia on March 3 when it said it had no plans to introduce restrictions on purchases.
Russell Zimmerman added that other products are also in high demand, including masks, sanitizers, dry foods, laundry soap, and flour.
Similarly, outside Australia, on Sunday night the British online supermarket Ocado was seen banning the purchase of Andres toilet paper for two in a 12-roller cake.
The World Health Organization has declared COVID-19 a pandemic
On Wednesday, the World Health Organization (WHO) called the ongoing COVID-19  disease caused by the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2  pandemic.
"While the term ""pandemic"" refers to the extent to which a disease has spread, not to how dangerous specific examples are, WHO has noted the need to urge governments to take action:"
All countries are still in a position to change the course of the pandemic.
If countries investigate, test, treat, isolate, track and respond by controlling human movements, says Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Executive Director.
We are deeply concerned about both the alarming and severe spread and the alarming lack of movement.
"According to Dr. Tom Frieden, former director of the United States' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the pandemic is ""unprecedented"."
"He said, in a commentary announced on CNN in February, ""apart from the flu, no other respiratory virus has been traced from its emergence until it spread worldwide"."
"Ghebreyesus expressed a similar view, saying that ""we have never seen before a pandemic that was wiped out by the spark of a coronavirus"."
"He continued, ""and we have never before seen an epidemic that can be controlled at the same time"."
The new pandemic situation follows WHO's decision in January to declare the outbreak a global public health emergency.
"The director of the United States' National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease, Dr. Anthony Fauci, said of the outbreak, ""what remains, will get worse"."
As of Thursday, the Associated Press reported that there have been at least 126,000 cases of COVID-19 worldwide, resulting in more than 4,600 deaths.
The 201920 coronavirus pandemic is an ongoing pandemic of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which is caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
The outbreak was identified in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, declared a State of Emergency of International Public Health Concern on 30 January 2020, and declared a pandemic on 11 March 2020.
As of 10 April 2020, 1.61 million positive cases of COVID-19 have been reported in 210 countries and territories, leading to 97,000 confirmed deaths.
Some 364,000 were cured.
The number of examples of extinction has been estimated at 4% in China, while the global rate has risen from 13.04% in Algeria to 0.08% in New Zealand.
Common symptoms include fever, cough, and shortness of breath.
Problems may include pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome.
The time from exposure to symptomatic exposure is usually five days, but it can take from two to fourteen.
No known cure or treatment can defeat the virus.
The recommended precautions include washing hands, covering your mouth when you cough, keeping a distance from others, and keeping an eye on and isolating yourself from people who suspect you may be infected.
Authorities around the world have responded by imposing travel restrictions, quarantines, movement times, workplace hazard control measures, and lockout.
The pandemic has led to severe economic and social disruption worldwide, postponements or cancellations of sporting, religious, political, and cultural events, and widespread shortages of essential goods that are rushed out of the market.
Schools including boarding schools are closed nationwide or in 193 countries, affecting to be exact 99.4 percent of the world's student population.
Misinformation about the virus has spread on the Internet, and there have been cases of racial discrimination and prejudice against Chinese, some people from the East with ancestry and appearance from countries in North Asia, and others from news outlets with many examples of the virus.
As a result of reduced transportation and the closure of large industries, there has been a reduction in air pollution and carbon emissions.
Health authorities in Wuhan, China (capital of Hubei province) reported a series of pneumonia cases of unknown origin on 31 December 2019, and an investigation was opened in early January 2020.
Many examples were linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market so the virus is thought to have originated from animal transmission.
The virus that caused the outbreak is known as SARS-CoV-2, an emerging virus closely related to bat coronaviruses, pangolin coronaviruses, and SARS-CoV. The first known person to show symptoms was later found to have started ill on 1 December 2019, and the person never had an apparent connection to the wet market chain.
In the first batch of samples reported in December 2019, three segments were found to be connecting the market.
On 13 March 2020, an unconfirmed report from the South China Morning Post suggested that a case tracing back to 17 November 2019, of a 55-year-old man from Hubei Province, may be the first.On 26 February 2020, WHO reported that, as new cases are reported to be declining in China but increasing rapidly in Italy, Iran, and South Korea, the number of new cases outside China had already surpassed the number of new cases in China for the first time.
There may be under-reporting, especially among those with mild symptoms.
By 26 February, small cases had been reported among adolescents, those aged 19 and under accounting for 2.4% of cases worldwide.The United Kingdom's chief scientific adviser, Patrick Vallance, estimated that 60% of the British population would need to be infected for effective herd immunity to be achieved.
Examples refer to the number of people tested for COVID-19, and their confirmatory testing is verified in accordance with the legal process.
As of March 23, no country had tested more than 3% of its population, and many countries had laws that prevented testing of those with mild symptoms, such as Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, and Switzerland.
A study published on 16 March found that in China, as of 23 January, 86% of COVID-19 infections had not been detected, and these unrecorded infections were the source of 79% of recorded cases.
A statistical analysis published on 30 March estimated that the number of infections in Italy is much higher than the reported cases.
The initial estimate of the simple reproduction rate (R0) for COVID-19 was 1.4 to 2.4.
A study published by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention concludes that it may be 5.7.
Many people with COVID-19 are recovering.
For those who do not recover, the time from the onset of symptoms to death is between 6 and 41 days, most commonly 14 days.
As of 10 April 2020, at least 97,000 deaths have been attributed to COVID-19.
In China, as of 5 February, nearly 80% of deaths were those over 60, and 75% were due to pre-existing health problems including heart disease and diabetes.Official deaths from the COVID-19 pandemic generally refer to people who died and tested positive for COVID according to the legal process.
The actual death toll from COVID-19 may be much higher, as it does not include all people who die without testing - e.g. at home, in a nursing home, etc.
Partial data from Italy found that the number of deaths due to over-exposure during the pandemic exceeded the official death toll from COVID by 4-5x.
"A spokesperson for the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) admitted ""We know that [the released death toll] is underestimated"", a statement consistent with anecdotal reports of undercounting in the U.S. Such underestimates are common in epidemics, such as the 2009 H1N1 swine flu pandemic. The first confirmed death was in Wuhan on 9 January 2020".
The first death outside mainland China itself occurred on February 1 in the Philippines, and the first death outside Asia occurred in France on February 14.
On February 28, in addition to mainland China itself, more than a dozen deaths were recorded in Iran, South Korea, and Italy.
By 13 March, more than forty countries and territories had reported deaths, on all continents except Antarctica.
These numbers vary by location and over time, and are influenced by the size of the test, the state of the health care system, the types of treatment, the time since the outbreak began, and social factors such as age, sex, and overall health.
Based on Johns Hopkins University statistics, the global death-to-case ratio is 6.0% (97,039/1,617,204) as of 10 April 2020.
The number varies from place to place.
In China, the estimated death-to-case ratio decreased from 17.3% (for those with symptoms on 110 January 2020) to 0.7% (for those with symptoms on 1 February 2020).Other measures include case fatality rate (CFR), which indicates the percentage of tested people who die from the disease, and infection fatality rate (IFR), which indicates the percentage of infected (tested and untested) who die from the disease.
These figures are not time-dependent and follow the number of individuals from infection with the sample solution.
A number of scholars have tried to calculate these population figures.
The University of Oxford's Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine estimates that the infection fatality rate for the overall pandemic is between 0.1% and 0.39%.
The high scores for this range are consistent with results from randomized COVID-19 testing in Germany, and statistical studies analyzing the results of the estimated testing by the CFR.
WHO insists that the epidemic can be controlled.
The actual magnitude and duration of the outbreak is uncertain and may vary by location.
"If left unchecked", said Maciej Boni of Penn State University, "the contagious outbreak slows and begins to subside when the disease is no longer detectable by the caregivers".
"But it is almost impossible to make accurate predictions at this time about when that will be""."
"The Chinese government's chief medical adviser Zhong Nanshan said ""it could be over by June"" if all countries make a move to follow WHO's advn measures to stop the spread of the virus".
"On 17 March, Adam Kucharski of the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine spoke of SARS-CoV-2 as ""going around, with intensity for one or two years""".
"According to a study by the Imperial College led by Neil Ferguson, physical isolation and other measures will be necessary ""until a cure is found (by hygiene for 18 months or more) """.
"William Schaffner of Vanderbilt University said, ""I think it is unlikely that this coronavirus will disappear forever"" and could ""become a seasonal disease, recurring every year".
The strength of the return will depend on the flock's strong defences and the degree to which they adapt
COVID-19 symptoms may be indirect and infected people may not have symptoms.
The two most common symptoms are fever (88%) and dry cough (68%).
Less common symptoms include fatigue, sputum and phlegm, loss of smell, shortness of breath, muscle and joint pain, sore throat, headache, chills, vomiting, hemoptysis, diarrhea, or cyanosis.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has a list of emergency symptoms such as difficulty breathing, persistent chest pain or depression, vomiting, difficulty waking up, and blue face or lips; immediate medical attention is recommended if these symptoms are present.
Some of those infected may have no symptoms, no medical symptoms but their test results confirm infection, so researchers have issued a recommendation that those who have had close contact with those who are confirmed should be closely monitored and tested to confirm the absence of disease.
China's estimates of no-symptom ratios range from a few to 44%.
The normal warm-up period (the period between infection and onset of symptoms) ranges from one to 14 days; typically it is five days.To illustrate the uncertainty, estimates of the proportion of people with COVID-19 who lose their sense of smell were initially 30% and later dropped to 15%.
Some details of how the disease spreads are still being explored in modern times.
It is believed that the disease is spread primarily through close contact and small droplets formed when coughing, sneezing, or speaking; when close contact is about 1 to 2 meters (3 to 6 shoulders).
Studies have found that uncovered coughing can cause droplets to travel a distance of up to 4.5 meters (15 feet) to 8.2 meters (27 feet).
Some have suggested that the virus may be transmitted by tiny droplets that linger in the air, which may be present during speech. Respiratory droplets may also form during exhalation, including when speaking, although the virus is not usually transmitted through the air.
Drops may settle on the lips or noses of people nearby or may be carried into the lungs.
Other treatments such as intubation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) may cause the respiratory system to become inflamed and result in airway splashes.
It can also spread when someone touches an infected area, including the skin, and then touches his or her eyes, nose, or mouth.
Although there is concern that it may spread by mosquitoes, the risk is believed to be low.
The Chinese government has denied the possibility of transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 virus by mouth contact after contact with feces.The virus is highly contagious during the first three days of symptoms although transmission may occur before symptoms appear and in the later stages of the disease.
People tested for the virus up to three days before symptoms appear, suggesting that transmission may occur before the development of major symptoms.
Only a few reports of asymptomatic samples have been confirmed in the laboratory, but asymptomatic transmission has been identified in other countries during contact tracing investigations.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) notes that although it is not clear how easily a disease spreads, one person usually infects two or three others.
Specifically, the virus has been found to persist for up to three days in plastic (polypropylene) and 304 in stainless steel, one day in cardboard, and up to four hours in the dust.
This, however, varies depending on the climate and temperature and cold.Pets and other animals have been believed to have been positively infected with COVID-19.
There is no evidence that animals can transmit the virus to humans, although British guides recommended washing hands after touching animals, as is the case after touching areas where infected people may have been.
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a new virus, which was first isolated from three people who had pneumonia associated with a series of respiratory illness samples in Wuhan.
All symptoms of the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus occur in a manner related to the nature of coronaviruses. Outside the human body, the virus dies in the host tissue, as it dissolves its outer protective layer.SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to the original SARS-CoV.
It is caused by a genetic link.
Genetic studies have revealed that the coronavirus is genetically clustered with the Betacoronavirus strain, sub-types of the Sarbecovirus (lineage B) both with traces from bats.
It is 96% identical throughout the nutrient level of other bat samples (BatCov RaTG13).
In February 2020, Chinese researchers found that there is one different amino acid cluster in certain parts of the genetic order between the bacteria from pangolins and those from humans.
All genetic comparisons to date have found that approximately 92% of the genetic identity is between the pangolin coronavirus and SARS-CoV-2, which is not enough to prove that pangolins are intermediate hosts.
Viral infection may in some cases be detected by visual symptoms, although the ultimate confirmation comes from a transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) of the infected tissue or a CT scan.
A study comparing PCR and CT in Wuhan suggested that CT is much more sensitive than PCR, although its clarity is lower, since many of its images are grouped with other pneumonia and disease processes.
"As of March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommends that ""CT should not be used for diagnostic purposes or as a first line of test for COVID-19"."
WHO has published several RNA testing guidelines for SARS-CoV-2, the first of which was issued on 17 January.
The test uses real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR).
The test may be performed with breath samples or blood.
Results are usually obtained over a period of a few hours to days.
This test is usually done with a nasopharyngeal swab although a throat swab may also be used.A number of laboratories and companies are developing a natural, antibody-sensitive test.
As of 6 April 2020, none of these have emerged as sufficiently accurate to be approved for universal use.
In the US the natural process test developed by Cellex is authorized for emergency use only by certified laboratories.
Characteristic features of imaging in radiographs and computed tomography (CT) of symptomatic individuals include asymmetric peripheral ground glass opacities and absent pleural effusions.
The Italian Radiological Society is compiling an online database of worldwide images of confirmed samples.
Due to the prevalence of other diseases such as adenovirus, taking pictures without PCR confirmation limits the accuracy of detecting COVID-19.
A large study in China compared the results of CT and PCR asthma and showed that although the imaging is of a low degree in determining infection, it is rapid and highly sensitive, suggesting consideration as a testing tool in epidemic areas.
Convolutional neural networks based on artificial intelligence have been developed to be able to investigate the features of viral images with both radiographs and CT scans.
Strategies to prevent transmission include maintaining strict personal hygiene, washing hands, avoiding touching eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands, and coughing or sneezing with a towel and putting the towel directly in the trash.
Those who may have been infected were encouraged to wear a face covering in public.
Measures of physical distancing have also been encouraged to prevent transmission.Many governments have imposed restrictions or warned against non-essential travel to or from countries affected by the pandemic.
Yet, the virus has reached a breaking point in communities throughout parts of the world.
This means that the virus is still spreading within communities, and some members of the public do not know where or how they are infected. Health care providers caring for someone who may be infected are encouraged to use established surveillance, contact monitoring, and eye protection. Tracking the affected is an important way for health authorities to identify the source of infection and prevent further transmission.
The government's use of location data from cell phones for this purpose has removed concerns about privacy rights, with Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations issuing a statement calling for limits on this surveillance method.
Various mobile apps have been installed or proposed for voluntary use, and as of April 7, 2020, more than a dozen expert teams were working on privacy-friendly solutions, such as using Bluetooth to log a user's proximity to other mobile devices.
Users can now receive a message when they have been in close contact with someone who has been tested and confirmed to have COVID-19.There are misconceptions about ways to prevent infection; for example, cleaning the nose and mouthwashing is not effective.
There is no cure for COVID-19, although many organizations are working to develop one.
Hand washing is recommended to prevent the spread of disease.
The CDC recommends that people wash their hands regularly with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after leaving the toilet or when their faces appear unclean; before eating; and after coughing, coughing, or sneezing.
The reason for this is that outside the human body, the virus is killed by household soap, for it blows up its protective bubble.
The CDC also recommended the use of alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol by volume if soap and water are not available at the time.
WHO recommends that people avoid touching their eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands.
Surfaces can be contaminated with a few solutions (within one minute of exposure to a disinfectant on a stainless steel surface), including 6271% ethanol, 50100% isopropanol, 0.1% sodium hypochlorite, 0.5% hydrogen peroxide, and 0.27.5% povidone-iodine.
Other solutions, such as benzalkonium chloride and crohexidine gluconate, have a low efficacy.
CDC recommends that if a COVID sample is suspected or confirmed in an area such as an office or a daycare, all areas such as offices, restrooms, public areas, public appliances such as tablets, touch screens, keyboards, remote controls, and ATM machines used by patients, must be disinfected.
Health organizations recommend that people cover their mouth and nose with an elbow or tissue when coughing, or sneezing, and dispose of any tissue immediately.
Masks are recommended for those who may be infected, since wearing a mask limits the frequency and distance of breath droplets that come out of the air when you speak, sneeze, and cough.
WHO has issued guidelines on when and how to use masks.
"According to Stephen Griffin, a virologist at the University of Leeds, ""Wearing a mask can reduce the tendency [of] people to touch their faces, which is the main source of infection without proper hand hygiene. ""Masks are also encouraged to be used by those caring for someone who may be infected".
WHO has recommended that people who are not sick should only wear masks when they are at high risk, such as those caring for someone with COVID-19, although it also acknowledges that wearing masks can help people avoid touching their faces.
Many countries have begun to promote the use of face masks by members of the public.
In the U.S., the CDC recommends wearing a fabric mask instead of a medical one.China has specifically recommended that members of the non-ill community use disposable medical masks, especially when in close proximity by ((1 meter (3 ft) or less) from other people.
Hong Kong recommends wearing a face mask when taking public transportation or sitting in crowded areas.
Health officials in Thailand's are encouraging people to make cloth masks at home and wash them daily.
The Czech Republic and Slovakia have legally banned going out in public without wearing a mask or covering the nose and mouth.
On 16 March, Vietnam asked everyone to wear a mask when going out in public places to protect themselves and others.
The Austrian government has made it mandatory for everyone entering a restaurant to wear a face mask.
Israel has asked all citizens to wear a mask when in public.
Taiwan, which has been producing 10 million masks a day since mid-March, has asked passengers on trains and city buses to wear face masks by April 1.
Panama has made it mandatory to wear a face mask whenever you go out, while at the same time encouraging home-made face masks for those who cannot afford to buy face masks.
Face masks have been widely used in Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, and Singapore.
Isolation (also known as physical isolation) involves measures to control infection intended to speed up the spread of disease by reducing close contact with people.
The roads include quarantine; travel restrictions; and the closure of schools, workplaces, stadiums, theaters, and shopping centers.
Individuals can take steps to isolate themselves by staying at home, limiting visits, avoiding crowded places, greeting without contact, and physically isolating themselves from others.
Many governments are now enforcing or promoting social distancing in those areas affected by the pandemic.
The maximum number of rallies recommended by US government agencies and health organizations was suddenly reduced from 250 people (if there was no spread of COVID-19 in the area) to 50 people, and later to 10 people.
On 22 March 2020, Germany officially banned public gatherings of more than two people. Older adults and those with pre-existing health conditions such as diabetes, heart disease, respiratory disease, asthma, and weakened immune systems are at risk of serious illness and complications and the CDC has warned them to stay at home as much as possible in public places with epidemics. In late March 2020, WHO and other health departments began using the term 'physical isolation' instead of 'social isolation', to clarify that the goal is to reduce physical contact while maintaining social contact, either online or via text messaging.
"The use of the term ""social isolation"" then leads to the conclusion that people should fully participate in social isolation, rather than encouraging them to continue contacting others in different ways. Some authorities have issued guidelines on sexual health that can be applied during the pandemic".
These include encouragement to have sex only with a cohabitant, who is not infected or has no symptoms of the virus.
Home isolation is recommended for those who have tested positive for COVID-19 and those who suspect they may be infected.
Health authorities have issued detailed quarantine orders by staying at home appropriately. Many governments have imposed or encouraged quarantine for everyone living in affected areas.
The strictest quarantine instructions have been issued by those in the most vulnerable groups.
Those who may have been exposed to someone with COVID-19 and those who have recently visited a country or region with widespread transmission have been encouraged to quarantine for 14 days from the time of possible last exposure.
Epidemic control strategies are containment or containment, and mitigation.
Quarantine is followed in the early stages of the pandemic and the goal is to track and isolate those infected and to introduce other infection control programs and treatments to prevent the disease from spreading to other populations.
When it is no longer possible to stop the spread of disease, efforts are shifted from the slowdown phase: steps are taken to slow the spread and reduce its impact on health care and society.
Pairing both the blocking and reducing measures may be followed at the same time.
The suppression requires very strict measures to slow down the epidemic by reducing the simple breeding rate to less than 1. Part of managing an infectious disease outbreak is to try to slow the peak of the epidemic, known as the plague line.
This reduces the risk of health services being found to be disrupted and gives more time for medicines and remedies to be developed.
Non-medical interventions that can control the outbreak include personal protective measures, such as hand hygiene, wearing face masks, self-isolation, public measures aimed at physical isolation such as closing schools and cancelling public gatherings; participation in encouraging the public to welcome and participate in such interventions; as well as environmental measures such as sanitation.
Other countries have also adopted various measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus.
South Korea introduced public observation and quarantine, and issued warnings about the movement of those infected.
Singapore provided financial support for those infected and quarantined and imposed high fines on those who failed to do so.
Taiwan has increased the production of face masks and imposed a penalty for the seizure of medical supplies.Mapping the situation in Great Britain and the United States shows that mitigation (slowing but not stopping the spread of the epidemic) and containment (slowing the spread of the epidemic) have major challenges.
Basic mitigation laws may reduce the critical need for health care by two-thirds and deaths by half, yet the result is hundreds of thousands of deaths and the disruption of health systems.
Suppression may be better but needs to be maintained as long as the virus continues to circulate in the human community (or until a cure is found, if that comes first), since transmission jumps quickly when steps are released.
Long-term interventions to curb epidemics are costly to society and the economy.
There is no specifically authorized vaccine against COVID-19, but efforts are underway, including testing of existing drugs.
Taking over-the-counter medications, drinking fluids, and resting can help relieve the symptoms.
Depending on the severity, ventilation, intravenous fluid, and breathing support may be necessary.
The use of steroids may have negative effects.
Many compounds that have been approved for other emerging diseases are being investigated for use in the treatment of COVID-19.
"WHO also issued a statement that some ""traditional and home remedies"" may provide relief from the symptoms caused by SARS-CoV-19.
Strengthening and adapting healthcare to the needs of COVID-19 patients is recommended by WHO as a critical step in response to the outbreak.
ECDC and the European regional office of WHO have issued guidelines for hospitals and primary health care providers on shifting services in different phases, including focusing laboratory activities on COVID-19 testing, cancelling preferential procedures where possible, screening and quarantining confirmed COVID-19 patients, and increasing the capacity of critical care by training staff and increasing the number of respirators and beds.
There are differing opinions as to where the first specimen (called the egg patient) came from.
The first known case of the novel coronavirus dates back to 1 December 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei, China.
In about a month, the number of coronavirus cases in Hubei rose slightly.
These were closely linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, which also sells live animals, and the theory is that the virus originated from one of these species; or, in other words, it has a genetic origin.
"On December 30, a team of doctors at Wuhan Central Hospital warned their fellow patients about the ""SARS-like coronavirus"."
Eight doctors, including Li Wenliang, were charged by the police for spreading false rumors, and another, Ai Fen, was reprimanded by his superiors for making a fuss.
The Wuhan Municipal Health Commission later issued a public notice on December 31 and reported to WHO.
Sufficient samples of unknown pneumonia had been reported to Wuhan health authorities to remove the investigation in early January. In the early stages of the outbreak, the number of samples doubled at least every seven and a half days.
In early and mid-January 2020, the virus spread to other regions of China, helped by transportation due to the Chinese New Year and that Wuhan is a transportation hub and major railway interchange.
On January 20, China reported about 140 cases in one day, including two in Beijing and one in Shenzhen.
Later official data showed that 6,174 people were showing symptoms by 20 January 2020.As of 26 March, the United States has overtaken China and Italy in the highest number of confirmed cases in the world.As of 9 April 2020, more than 1.61 million cases have been reported worldwide; more than 97,000 people have died and more than 364,000 have recovered.
At least 200 countries and territories have at least one example.
Because of the epidemic in Europe, many countries in the Schengen area have imposed restrictions on free movement and have raised border controls.
The national response included detention measures such as quarantine (known as stay-at-home orders, shelter-at-home orders, or lockdowns) and time limits. As of April 2, nearly 300 million people, or 90% of the population, are under some form of lockdown in the United States, more than 50 million people are under lockdown in the Philippines, at least 59 million people are under lockdown in South Africa, and 1.3 billion people are under lockdown in India.
On March 26, 1.7 billion people worldwide were under a form of lockdown, which then rose to 2.6 billion people two days later - about three-quarters of the world's population.
The first confirmed case of COVID-19 was traced back to 1 December 2019 in Wuhan; one unconfirmed report suggests that the first case was on 17 November.

Monitoring methods include mandatory self-reporting of symptoms for foreigners through a cell phone system, passing-by virus testing when results are available the next day, and increased testing capacity that will allow 20,000 people to be tested daily.
South Korea's program is considered a successful program in controlling the pandemic despite not fully closing down cities.South Korean society was divided in opinion at the outset when President Moon Jae-in responded to the crisis.

Shia religious temples in Qom remained open until 16 March 2020.In February Iran became the epicenter of the virus outbreak, following China.
Allegations that Iran had downplayed the true number of cases to spread a false picture prompted more than a dozen countries with cases to investigate the origin of the disease, finding that the disease had already been present in Iran by February 28, the day the Iranian government reported only 388 cases, which may have been much higher than previously reported.
On March 3, Iran's parliament was suspended after 23 of its 290 members tested positive for the virus.

The UK's response to the first outbreak was modest compared to other affected countries, and until 18 March 2020, the British government had not implemented any plans to reduce the level of contact or to isolate those infected with the virus to prevent the spread of the disease.
As a result, the government has been criticized for not taking the issue seriously and for not responding to public concerns.

Despite these measures, the United States delayed the launch of testing programs to determine how many people had already been infected, making it difficult to determine the extent of the spread of the disease.
Monitoring of the spread was hampered by the lack of effective testing equipment as those sent by the government office in February were dead, the lack of government approval to use testing equipment from private organizations (such as research and educational institutions, companies and hospitals) until the end of February and the conditions for testing people until the beginning of March (after which a doctor's prescription was required).

"On 23 January, in response to the decision of the central authorities to impose a travel ban on Wuhan, WHO representative Gauden Galea noted that while this ""is not at all a WHO recommendation"", at the same time ""it is the most important decision to commit to contain the epidemic in the most concentrated area"" and called it ""unprecedented in the history of public health"". On 30 January, following the confirmation of human-to-human transmission outside China and the rise in cases in other countries, WHO declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC), the sixth such outbreak since the start of the 2009 swine flu pandemic".
"WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom said PHEIC was a cause of ""the risk of global spread, especially in low- and middle-income countries without a robust health system".
"In response to the imposition of travel restrictions, Tedros issued that ""there is no reason for measures affecting unnecessary international travel and trade"" and that ""WHO does not recommend imposing restrictions on trade and movement"""

"Tedros went on to recount suggesting that ""we are only strong at the level of our weakest"" and urged the international community to ""invest today or pay more in the future"". On 11 February, WHO during a press conference designated COVID-19 as the name of the disease".
"On the same day, Tedros said that UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres had agreed to provide ""power to the entire UN system in response""".

The Chinese government has been heavily criticized by the United States, UK Cabinet Office Minister Michael Gove, and Eduardo Bolsonaro, son of Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, for the way they handled the pandemic, which began in the Chinese province of Hubei.
A number of provincial-level hosts of the Communist Party of China (CPC) were dismissed on the grounds of their handling of the containment efforts in Central China, a sign of dissatisfaction with the way the political branch was responding to the outbreak in those areas.
Some analysts believe that the move was intended to protect Chinese Communist Party general secretary Xi Jinping from public outrage over the coronavirus outbreak.
Some Chinese workers, e.g. Zhao Lijian initially refused to accept the first coronavirus outbreak in Wuhan, preferring conspiracy theories about COVID-19 as originating in the U.S. or Italy.
"The U.S. administration of Donald Trump has called the coronavirus ""the Chinese virus"" and the ""Wuhan virus"" saying that China's ""secretly facilitating the virus that has now become a global pandemic"", which has been criticized by some critics as discriminatory ""and interfering with his administration's failure to contain the disease""".
"The Daily Beast obtained information from a U.S. newspaper detailing a conspiracy strategy apparently from the National Security Council, the strategy being quoted as ""Everything is about China".
"We are told to try to get this message out in any way possible, including press conferences and TV appearances. ""Radio stations such as Politico, Foreign Policy, and Bloomberg have reported that China's efforts to send aid to the affected countries are part of a propaganda to reach out to influence the world".
"EU foreign policy official Josep Borrell warned that there is a ""spark of local politics combining the war for influence with the 'politics of liberal liberalism'""."
"Borrell also said ""China is pushing hard for a message that, unlike the US, it is a responsible and reliable partner"."
China has also advocated for the US to lift its sanctions on Syria, Venezuela and Iran, although it is reportedly sending aid to the latter two countries.

"The NATO-scheduled "Defender 2020"" military exercises in Germany, Poland, and the Baltic states, which are the largest NATO military exercises since the end of the Cold War, will be conducted on a reduced scale".
"The Secretary General of The Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament Kate Hudson has criticized the Defender 2020 test: ""In the midst of a public health crisis, not only the lives of soldiers from the US and other participating European countries are at risk but also the lives of citizens of the countries where they serve. ""The Iranian government is under a lot of pressure from the virus, with some twenty-four parliamentarians and fifteen current or former politicians".
Iranian President Hassan Rouhani wrote a letter to world leaders asking for help on 14 March 2020, his country struggling to combat the crisis due to the lack of access to global markets caused by the US sanctions against Iran. The crisis has led to recommendations that the United States adopt social policies that are as considerate as other wealthy nations, universal health care, child care, paid family leave and high-quality public health care.
Political analysts expect that it may negatively affect Donald Trump's chances of winning the 2020 presidential election. Political relations between Japan and South Korea have deteriorated due to the pandemic.

A few areas have seen rush-to-purchase that has led to rapid depletion of basic necessities such as food, toilet paper, and purchased water, leading to shortages of basic necessities
The technology industry has been warning of delays in the transportation of electronic goods.
According to WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom, the demand for personal protective equipment has increased by a factor of 100.
This demand has led to a price increase of up to twenty times the average purchase price and has created a four to six-month delay in medical supplies
It also caused a worldwide shortage of personal protective equipment and WHO warned that this puts the lives of medical personnel at risk.
In Australia, the pandemic has created a new opportunity for daigou buyers to sell Australian products to China
Despite the high level of Covid-19 in Northern Italy and the Wuhan region and the subsequent high demand for food, both areas did not experience severe food shortages.
China and Italy's measures against hoarding and smuggling of essential commodities have succeeded in preventing the expected food shortage in Europe and North America
Northern Italy and its agricultural bounty have not seen a significant decline, but according to industry representatives, prices may rise.
Food shelves were briefly empty even in the city of Wuhan, and in China, government officials have released stored pork to ensure the nutrition of the citizens.
Similar laws exist in Italy that require those who provide food to store for emergencies.
The global economic damage was felt in China, according to media reports on 16 March 2020, China's economy was hit hard in the first two months of 2020 due to government measures to contain the spread of the virus, with retail purchases deteriorating by 20.5%.

Tourism is one of the industries most affected by travel restrictions, closures of public and tourist sites as well as governmental advisories against travel worldwide.
As a result, airlines have cancelled flights due to declining demand including British Airways, China Eastern Airlines and Qantas and British airline Flybe has fallen.
The impact on the cruise industry was unprecedented.
Some railway and ferry stations will be closed.
The epidemic occurred during the Chunyu, a prominent tourist season associated with Chinese New Year.
Many events that draw large crowds have been cancelled by national and regional governments as well as New Year's celebrations and private companies are also closing shops and tourist attractions such as Hong Kong Disneyland and Shanghai Disneyland.
Many Lunar festivals and tourist sites have also been closed to prevent large gatherings, including the Forbidden City in Beijing and traditional Temple festivals.
In 24 of China's 31 provinces, municipalities, and provinces, authorities have extended the New Year holiday to 10 February, telling all workplaces not to open until that day.
These regions represent 80% of the country's GDP and 90% of its exports.
Hong Kong has increased the rate of infectious disease to a level that has led to the declaration of a state of emergency, the closure of schools until March and the cancellation of the New Year celebrations.
Shopping trips in Europe and Latin America declined by 40%
North America and the Middle East saw a 50-60% decline
This has resulted in a 33 to 43 percent drop in mall visits in March compared with February.
Shopping mall owners around the world have set new standards, such as drinking cleaners and thermal scanners, to detect temperature in shoppers and cancel events. According to the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America, the economic downturn caused by the pandemic may leave 14 to 22 million people more disadvantaged than they would have been without the pandemic.
In January and February 2020, during the height of the epidemic in Wuhan, 5 million people in China lost their jobs.
Most of the estimated 300 million migrant workers are locked in their homes in the interior provinces or trapped in Hubei Province.As of March 2020, more than 10 million Americans lost their jobs and sought government assistance.
The coronavirus pandemic could cost 47 million jobs in the United States and the unemployment rate could be as high as 32% according to the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. Lockdowns in India have left tens of millions of Indian hourly wage workers unemployed. A study by the Angus Rei Institute found that 44% of Canadian households have been affected by unemployment. Nearly 900,000 workers in Spain have lost their jobs since the country's lockdown began in mid-March 2020.
During the second half of March, 4 million French workers signed up for temporary benefits and 1 million British workers signed up for the universal credit scheme. Nearly half a million companies in Germany have moved workers into a government-run reduced-time program called Kurzarbeit.
This German system of shortened working hours has been adopted by France and Britain.
The arts and culture industries have been significantly affected by the pandemic disrupting the functioning of organizations and individuals - both employed and private - worldwide.
Arts and cultural organizations have tried to run their own programs, often government-sponsored, to open up to the public and keep their employees and the public safe and to support the heroes.
Then in March 2020, worldwide and to varying degrees, museums, libraries, playgrounds and cultural venues were closed indefinitely, and fights and sports were cancelled or postponed.
Efforts were made to meet the needs through technology, including the rapid and new cancellation of religious, sporting, and other social events such as festivals and concerts and conferences on technology and fashion.
The Vatican has announced that the observance of Holy Week in Rome, which occurs during the last week of the Christian month of Lent, has been canceled.
Dioceses have encouraged elderly Christians to stay at home rather than attend church services on Sundays. Some churches have made their programs available by radio, live streaming, or television.
By closing its churches and St. Peter's Square, the Roman Catholic Diocese of Rome has dismissed all pilgrims and other organizations have canceled or restricted gatherings in churches, mosques, synagogues, temples, and gurdwaras
The Ministry of Health in Iran announced the cancellation of Friday prayers in the areas affected by the pandemic and places of worship were closed and in Saudi Arabia foreign believers and citizens were banned from entering the holy places in Mecca and Medina.
The pandemic has caused the greatest disruption to global sports programs since World War II.
Many major tournaments have been postponed or abandoned altogether, including the 2019 to 2020 UEFA Champions League, the 2019 to 2020 Premier League, the 2020 UEFA Euro, the 2019 to 2020 NBA Season and the 2019 to 2020 NHL season.
"The outbreak disrupted the 2020 Summer Olympics which were originally scheduled to begin in late July; the International Olympic Committee announced on 24 March that the games ""will be rescheduled for a post-2020 season but no later than the summer of 2021"". Casinos and other sports venues around the world have been closed and live poker tournaments have been postponed or cancelled".
This has led to online gambling, with many gambling sites reporting a dramatic increase in sign-ups, the entertainment industry also affected, and bands have suspended or canceled concert tours.
Many theaters such as the one on Broadway suspend all performances.
"Some artists have explored ways to continue recording and sharing their work on the Internet instead of playing live as usual, such as by making live streaming of concerts or by creating web-based ""events"" for artists to perform, broadcast and publicize their work".
Many coronavirus-related memes have spread online as many turn to jokes and distractions amid uncertainty.
Since the outbreak of COVID-19, a high level of prejudice, racism and racial discrimination has been observed against people of non-Chinese and East Asian origin and against people from certain parts of Europe, the United States and other countries.
Cases of fear, suspicion, and hostility have been observed in many countries, especially in Europe, East Asia, North America, and the Asia-Pacific region.
The February reports, when most of the cases were within China's borders, noted the racial sentiments expressed by various groups around the world that the Chinese deserve the virus or are getting what they call a vengeance.
Other African countries have seen an increase in antipathy toward the Chinese.
Many residents of Wuhan and Hubei reported being trained because of their origins
There is support from the Chinese both on social media and in real life for those in areas affected by the virus.
Following the spread of the outbreak to other countries, Italians, the first European country to experience a severe outbreak of Covid-19, may face accusations and racial discrimination. Residents of countries including Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore, and South Korea have started signing petitions to accompany campaigns to ban Chinese from entering their countries in an effort to contain the disease.
In Japan, the hashtag #ChineseDontComeToJapan has become popular on Twitter.
Chinese and other Asians in the United Kingdom and the United States report increasing rates of racial discrimination and beatings.
"U.S. President Donald Trump has faced criticism for referring to the coronavirus as the ""Chinese Virus"", a term critics consider racist and anti-Chinese".
Protesters in Ukraine attacked buses carrying Ukrainians and foreigners who were being deported from Wuhan to Novi Sanzhary.
Students from Northeast India, which borders China and studies in India's major cities, have reportedly suffered from the coronavirus outbreak.
"The president of The Bharatiya Janata Party in West Bengal Dilip Ghosh said the Chinese have killed the environment and ""that is why god has taken revenge on them""
"These statements have been condemned by the Chinese embassy in Kolkata, calling them ""erroneous"". In China, racism and racial discrimination against non-Chinese has been given a boost by the pandemic, foreigners were labeled ""foreign trash"" and scheduled for ""disposal""
Many paid newspapers have either withdrawn some subscription or stopped completely in regard to news about the coronavirus.
Numerous scientific publishers have made scientific papers on the outbreak freely available.
Some scientists have chosen to share their results with others immediately on preprint servers such as bioRxiv.

Testing for respiratory coronavirus disease 2019 Covid-19 and related SARS-CoV-2 virus includes methods for detecting the presence of the virus and those that detect antibodies that form as a result of infection.
The presence of viruses in samples is confirmed by RT-PCR which detects the presence of coronavirus RNA.
This study was specifically designed to test the RNA of the SARS-Cov-2 virus.
It is used to confirm a recent or ongoing diagnosis.
Serology, the search for antibodies, can be used for both human disease diagnosis and host identification.
Antibody tests show how many people have been infected, including those whose symptoms were too small to report or who had no symptoms at all.
An accurate estimate of the mortality rate and the degree of immunity in the population can be obtained from the test results.
Due to limited testing numbers, as of March 2020, no countries had reliable statistics on the prevalence of the virus in their populations.
As of 23 March, no country had tested more than 3% of its population and there is considerable variation in the number of tests carried out in different countries.
This difference may have a major impact on the reported death rates, which may be exaggerated in some countries.
Using real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, rRt-PCR, this test can be performed on respiratory samples obtained by various means, including nasopharyngeal swab or sputum sample.
Results are usually obtained within two hours to 2 days.
A test called RT-PCR performed with throat swabs can be reliable only in the first week of infection.
In the future, the virus may disappear from the throat but continue to multiply in the lungs.
For infected people tested in the second week, alternative sample material can be extracted from the depths of the airways by suction catheter or by coughing material, sputum, can be used.
Some of the first PCR tests were developed at Charite in Berlin in January 2020 using real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction ,irRT-PCR, which forms the basis for the distribution of 250,000 kits by the World Health Organization, WHO.
The United Kingdom had also developed a test method on 23 January 2020. South Korean company Kogenebiotech developed a PCR-based clinical-grade SARSCoV-2 test kit on 28 January 2020.
"It detects the same ""E gene"" in all beta coronaviruses and the RdRp gene found only in SARS-CoV-2".In China, BGI Group was among the companies that received emergency approval from China's National Products Administration to use a PCR-based SARS-CoV-2 test kit.In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, CDC, is distributing the 2019 -Novel Coronavirus, 2019-Novel, Real-Time RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel to clinical testing facilities through the International Reagent Resource".
Three genetic tests on older test kit methods produced unclear results due to inefficient reagents and testing constraints at the CDC in Atlanta, resulting in an average of less than 100 samples per day successful throughout February 2020.
The two-stage test was not found to be unreliable until 28 February 2020 and until then provincial and local testing centres were allowed to start testing.
The test method was authorized by the Food and Drug Administration under the Emergency Use Authorization.Independent testing facilities began testing in early March 2020.
On 5 March 2020 LabCorp announced the nationwide availability of RT-PCR-based COVID-19 testing.
Quest Diagnostics has also made COVID-19 testing available as of 9 March 2020
No statistical limitations were announced, the collection and analysis of specimens must be done according to CDC requirements.
In Russia, the COVID-19 test was developed and produced by the State Research Center of Virology and Biotechnology VECTOR
On 11 February 2020 the test method was registered with the Federal Service for Surveillance in Healthcare. On 12 March 2020, it was reported that Mayo Clinic had developed a test model for the management of COVID-19. On 13 March 2020, Roche Diagnostics received FDA approval for a test model that can be performed within 3.5 hours thus allowing one machine to perform 4128 tests within 24 hours.
On 19 March 2020, the FDA issued Abbott Laboratories, EUA, emergency authorization to test with the Abbott m2000 system, the FDA had previously granted Hologic, LabCorp and Thermo Fisher Scientific similar authorization.
On 21 March 2020, Cepheid also received EUA through the FDA for a test version that lasted about 45 minutes.
The FDA has approved a test that uses isothermal nucleic acid amplification technology instead of PCR.
Because this does not require a series of cold and heat cycles, this strain can produce positive results in as little as five minutes and negative results in 13 minutes.
There are currently approximately 18,000 machines in the U.S. and Abbott expects to increase its production to 50,000 tests per day.A test using a monoclonal antibody specifically attached to the nucleocapsid protein, N protein, of the novel coronavirus is being developed in Taiwan with the hope that it can provide results in 15 to 20 minutes similar to influenza testing.
"A March 2020 literature review concluded that ""throat radiographs are not as helpful in the early stages and CT scans, computer tomography, may be available before symptoms begin to appear".
Common features of CT include bilateral multilobar ground-glass opacifities with peripheral, asymmetricand posterior distribution.
Subpleural dominance, crazy paving and consolidation increase as the disease mutates.
A study comparing PCR and CT in Wuhan at the epicentre of the outbreak suggested that CT is more sensitive than PCR but lacks data, many of its features being associated with other pneumonias and pathologies.
"As of March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommends that ""CT may be used to screen or test for COVID-19 for the first time"" As of March 2020, the CDC recommends PCR in vaccines for the first time"""
Part of the immune response to infection is the production of antibodies including Igm and GG.
These can be used to test for the presence of disease from 7 days or more after the onset of symptoms, to determine immunity and social employment.Assays can be done by primary testing centres, CLTs, or by point-of-care testing, PoCT.
The high level of automated systems in many medical laboratories will be able to work with assays but their availability will depend on the speed of each production.
With CLT, only one peripheral blood sample is normally used, although serial samples can be used for immune response.
With PoCT, one blood sample is usually obtained by skin scent.
Unlike PCR methods, a pre-exposure test is not required.On 26 March 2020, the FDA released the names of 29 agencies that reported to the agency as necessary and are now able to distribute their antibody tests.
As of 7 April 2020, only one test method has been approved by the FDA under emergency authorization.In late March 2020, Euroiminium Medical Laboratory Diagnostics and Epitome Diagnostics received approval for its European test kits that can test for IgG and IgA antibodies against the virus in blood samples.
The test capacity is a few hundred samples within an hour so it is much faster than the conventional PCR assay for Virus RNA.
The presence of antibodies is usually tested 14 days after infection. In April, the UK found that none of the antibody test kits it had purchased would be of any use.
"Hong Kong has added a system where suspected patients can stay at home, ""an emergency department that will give the patient a specimen tube"", so they can spit in half, return it and get results after a short time. The British NHS has announced that it is launching a home screening program to eliminate the threat of infection from the patient when going to the clinic or the need to disinfect the patient's vehicles if any are used. For suspected patients in COVID-19 testing centers without a car, the eye health worker who takes the samples will use appropriate screening".
In Germany, the National Association of Statutory Health Insurance Physicians said on March 2, it has a capacity of about 12,000 tests per day through a pilot program and 10,700 tests had been carried out in the past week.
The costs are covered by the health insurance when the test is called for by the doctor.
According to the president of the Robert Koch Institute, Germany has the capacity to hold 160,000 tests a week.
Starting on March 19, pass-drive tests were offered in most major cities.
As of 26 March 2020 the total number of tests conducted by Germany was unknown, as only accurate results were reported.
"The initial laboratory test showed that from the calendar week 12/2020 a total of at least 483,295 samples were tested up to and including the week 12/2020 with 33,491 samples ((6.9%) when tested confirming SARS-CoV-2.Israel, researchers at the Technion and Rambam Hospital also tested a method of testing samples from 64 patients once, by combining samples and further testing only when the combined sample showed confirmation.In Wuhan a 2000-square-meter emergency investigation laboratory called ""Huo-Yan"" (Chinese text: 火眼, or ""Lomo eye"" in English) was opened by the BGI in February 2020, to carry out more than 10,000 tests per day".
Since the facility was still under the supervision of BGI founder Wang Jian and took 5 days, simulation shows that samples in Hubei would have been 47% higher and the appropriate cost of meeting the quarantine would have doubled if the capacity to contain the test was not available in time.
The Wuhan lab is quickly followed by the Huo-Yan labs in Shenzhen, Tianjin, Beijing, and Shanghai, a total of 12 cities across China.
As of 4 March 2020 the total daily transmission has been 50,000 tests per day. Open source, complex diagrams released by Origami Assays are open to test multiple COVID19 patient samples up to 1,122 using only 93 assays. These technologically-similar diagrams can be used in small labs without the need for fluid-capturing robots.
Since March, the shortage and insufficient quantity of the reagent has become a major factor in most tests between the EU and the UK and the US.
This has led some authors to explore sample preparation policies involving heating samples to 98 °C (208 °F) for 5 minutes to release more RNA for further testing.On 31 March it was announced that the United Arab Emirates was now testing more of its population for Coronavirus per capita than any other country, and is well on its way to increasing the testing rate to reach a larger share of the population.
"This was a combination of containment-driving power, and purchasing a population-scale mass-throughput laboratory from Group 42 and BGI (based on the ""Huo-Yan"" emergency detection laboratories in China)".
Built in 14 days, the laboratory is capable of conducting tens of thousands of RT-PCR tests per day and is the first in the world of this effective standard outside of China.
Different screening methods for different components of the coronavirus are being developed in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan, and the United States.
The World Health Organization chose the German method for manufacturing kits that are exported to poor countries that lack the resources to manufacture their own.
The German protocol was published on 17 January 2020; the policy developed by the United States Centers for Disease Control was not available until 28 January, delaying testing available in the U.S. China and the United States faced reliability issues with test kits at the beginning of the outbreak, and these countries and Australia were unable to manufacture and export sufficient kits to meet the demand and incentive of health professionals.
In contrast, experts say the widespread availability of testing in South Korea has helped slow the spread of the new coronavirus.
The capacity to contain testing, especially in private laboratories, was developed over a period of many years by the South Korean government.
16 In March, the World Health Organization called for intensified testing procedures as the best way to slow the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. The high demand for testing due to the spread of the virus caused the accumulation of hundreds of thousands of workers in U.S. private laboratories, and the release of swabs and chemical reagents was pressured.
In March 2020 China reported problems with the accuracy of its testing kits.
"In the United States, CDC-designed test kits were found to be ""defective";"" the government removed the legal barriers that prevented private testing. Spain purchased the kits from the Chinese company Shenzhen Bioeasy Biotechnology Co Ltd, but found the results to be inaccurate".
The company explained that the erroneous results may be due to judging the collection of samples or the proper use of the kits.
The Spanish ministry said it would remove the kits that gave false results, and would replace them with separate kits supplied to Shenzhen Bioeasy. 80% of the test kits the Czech Republic purchased from China gave false results. Slovakia purchased 1.2 million test kits from China that were found to be inaccurate.
"Prime Minister Matovič suggested that they be discarded for being placed in the Danube. Ates Kara of the Turkish Health Ministry said that the test kits Turkey bought from China were found to have a ""high level of defects"" and were not ""used."" The UK purchased 3.5 million test kits from China but in early April 2020 announced that they were unusable".
The test, followed by quarantine of those found to be positive in the test and followed by those who had contact with people who showed positive in the SARS-CoV-2 test, was also positive.
Researchers working in the Italian city of Vò, the site of the first COVID-19 death in Italy, conducted two rounds of testing of a total population of 3,400 people, at least ten days apart.
At least half of the people who tested positive had no symptoms, and all samples found were locked up.
With visits restricted, this eliminates new infections altogether.
With active tracking of affected people, restricted inbound travel, testing, and lockdowns, the 2020 coronavirus pandemic in Singapore has progressed more slowly than other developed countries, but without stringent restrictions such as forcing the closure of restaurants and other retail outlets.
Many events have been cancelled, and Singapore began advising citizens to stay home on March 28, but schools reopened on time after the holiday break on March 23.
Several countries have also managed to manage the pandemic with active contact tracing, travel restrictions, screening, and quarantine, but to a lesser extent in lockdowns, such as Iceland and South Korea.
Statistical studies have found that countries that have tested more, compared to the death toll, have lower mortality rates, which may be the reason why they are in a better position to investigate those with mild or no symptoms.
WHO recommends that countries that do not have the capacity to contain testing and have national laboratories with limited experience with COVID-19 send the first five and 10 positive COVID-19 samples to one of the 16 WHO trusted laboratories to confirm testing.
Of the 16 trusted laboratories, 7 are in Asia, 5 in Europe, 2 in Africa, 1 in North America, and 1 in Australia.
In the following chart, the column  Confirmation % of tests is influenced by the national testing policy.
A country that only tests hospitalized patients will have more positive test results than a country that tests all of its citizens, whether they show symptoms or not, other factors being equal.
Hand washing (or handwashing), also known as hand hygiene, is the act of washing hands with the intent of removing dirt, grease, small objects, or unwanted spills.
Washing hands promptly with soap during those "critical times" during the day prevents the spread of many diseases, such as diarrhea and cholera, which are transmitted through the oral system.
People can also contract respiratory diseases such as the common cold or the common cold, for example, if they do not wash their hands before touching their eyes, nose, or mouth (that is, the areas that are still wet).
The five critical times during the day when washing hands with soap is important include: before and after unwrapping, after cleaning a baby's paws or changing the diaper, before feeding a baby, before and after eating and preparing food or handling raw meat, fish, or pet birds.
If soap and water are not available, hand washing can be done with ash.
Before, during, and after preparing food.
Before and after caring for a sick person.
After changing a toilet or cleaning a child's toilet.
After you sneeze, cough, or sneeze.
After touching an animal, animal food, or animal filth.
Medical hand hygiene refers to hygiene practices related to the medical process.
Washing hands before administering medicine or medical treatment can prevent or slow the spread of disease.
The primary purpose of medical handwashing is to cleanse the hands of pathogens (bacteria, viruses, or other microorganisms that can cause disease) and chemicals that can cause injury or disease.
This is especially important for people who handle food or work in the medical field, but it is also an important process for the general public.
Handwashing has many health benefits, including reducing the spread of flu, coronavirus, and other infectious diseases; preventing contagious causes of diarrhea; reducing respiratory infections;
reducing infant mortality in home births.
A 2013 study showed that improved hand-washing practices may lead to a lower rate of development in children under five years of age.
In developing countries, the rate of deaths of young people from respiratory diseases and diarrhea can be reduced by introducing simple behavioral changes, such as handwashing with soap.
A simple action can reduce the death rate from these diseases by about 50%.
Interventions that promote hand-washing with soap can reduce diarrhea episodes by three-quarters, and this can be compared to providing clean water to poor areas.
A 48-percent decrease in diarrhea episodes can be attributed to handwashing with soap. Handwashing is one of the most effective and inexpensive ways to prevent diarrhea and acute respiratory infections (ARI), as a natural behavior pattern occurs in homes, schools, and communities around the world.
Pneumonia, the major ARI, is alone the leading cause of death among infants under five years of age, claiming the lives of an estimated 1.8 million children each year.
Diarrhea and pneumonia both contribute to the deaths of about 3.5 million infants each year.
According to UNICEF, making hand-washing with soap before eating and after using the toilet a permanent practice can save more lives than any single remedy or medical intervention, cutting death from diarrhea by almost half and death from respiratory diseases by one half.
Hand washing is often combined with other waste disposal interventions as part of water, waste disposal and sanitation (WASH) systems.
Hand washing also prevents impetigo, which is spread by direct contact.
The minor risk of frequent hand washing is skin damage from dry skin.
A 2012 Danish study found that excessive hand washing can result in bites and a skin rash known as hand eczema, or hand dermatitis, which is more common among health care workers.
Frequent hand washing also appears to be one of the symptoms of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD).
There are five critical times during the day when hand washing with soap is important to reduce oral infection: after using the toilet (urinating, flushing), after cleaning the baby's gloves (changing the diapers), before feeding the baby, before eating or before/after preparing food or handling raw meat, fish, or poultry.
Other times when proper handwashing procedures should be followed to avoid transmission include before and after caring for cuts or wounds; after sneezing, coughing, or sneezing; after touching animal droppings or handling animals; and after touching garbage.
In many countries, there is a low level of handwashing with soap.
A handwashing survey in 54 countries in 2015 found that on average, 38.7% of households follow the handwashing procedure with soap. A 2014 study showed that Saudi Arabia had the highest rate of 97%, the United States near the median rate of 77%, and China the lowest rate of 23%. A few practices are now in place to promote the adoption of handwashing in critical situations.
The "Essential Health Care Program" initiated by the Department of Education in the Philippines is an example of a statistical initiative to promote children's health and education.
Two-year-old exfoliation, coupled with regular hand washing with soap, and daily fluoride brushing, is a cornerstone of the country's system.
It has also been successfully launched in Indonesia.
Removing microorganisms from the skin is also better with soap or detergent.
The main function of soap and detergents is to reduce the blockage of the solution, and increase solubility.
Water alone is not sufficient to cleanse the skin because fats and proteins, the basic building blocks of soil, are not easily dissolved in water.
But the cleaning is done by flowing water in moderation.
A dry soap, because it is reusable, may retain the remaining bacteria from the previous use.
A small number of studies that have looked at the transmission of the virus from a contaminated fecal sac have concluded that it is impossible since the bacteria are purified with foam.
The CDC continues that "liquid soap and hands-free control are better".
Disinfectant soaps have been heavily promoted by health-care professionals.
To date, there is no evidence that the use of proposed antiseptics or disinfectants prefers natural antibiotic-resistant organisms.
Antibacterial soaps, however, contain common antibacterial agents such as triclosan, which has a long list of resistant strains of organisms.
So even if antibiotic-resistant strains are not selected as an antibacterial soap, they may not be as effective as they are marketed.
Besides surfactant and skin-protective agent, complex compounds may contain acids (acetic acid, ascorbic acid, lactic acid) such as pH regulator, antimicrobially active benzoic acid and other skin care products (aloe vera, vitamins, menthol, plant extracts).A comprehensive study from the University of Oregon School of Public Health showed that non-consumer soaps are as effective as consumer-grade antibacterial soaps containing triclosan in preventing and removing germs from food.
Hot water that you can wash your hands with is not hot enough to kill germs.
Bacteria thrive when the temperature of the container is 37 °C.
Warm, soapy water, however, is more effective than cold, soapy water in removing the natural oils that trap soil and bacteria.
Contrary to popular belief, however, studies have shown that using warm water does not reduce the microbial load on the hands.
A hand sanitizer or hand antiseptic is a water-free hand sanitizer.
In the late 1990's and early part of the 21st century, alcohol-based hand rubs (also known as alcohol-based hand rubs, antiseptic hand rubs, or hand sanitizers) began to gain popularity.
Many based on isopropyl alcohol or ethanol were mixed with a flammable agent such as Carbomer (a polymer of acrylic acid) to make a gel, or a humectant such as glycerin to make a liquid, or foam to facilitate use and reduce the dryness of alcohol.
The use of liquid hydrogen peroxide increases the antimicrobial activity even further. Hand sanitizers with an alcohol content of 60 to 95% are effective in killing germs.
Alcoholic rub sanitizers kill bacteria, multi-drug resistant bacteria (MRSA and VRE), tuberculosis, and other viruses (including HIV, herpes, RSV, rhinovirus, vaccinia, influenza, and hepatitis) and fungi.
Alcohol rub sanitizers with 70% alcohol kill 99.97% (3.5 log reduction, equivalent to 35 decibel reduction) of germs on the hands within 30 seconds after lubrication and 99.99% to 99.999% (4 to 5 log reduction) of germs on the hands 1 minute after lubrication.
Hand sanitizers made of alcohol are almost ineffective against norovirus (or Norwalk) strains of bacteria, the main cause of infectious gastroenteritis.
The front and back of both hands and the inside and ends of the fingers are rubbed for about 30 seconds until the liquid, foam, or gel has dried.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends washing hands instead of using hand sanitizer, especially when hands are obviously dirty.
The advantage in using these agents is due to their ease of use and quick ability to kill microorganisms; however, they should be used to replace proper hand washing unless soap and water are not available.
Regular use of alcohol-based hand sanitizers can cause dry skin unless emollients and/or skin moisturizers are added to the mixture.
The drying process of alcohol can be slowed down or stopped by adding glycerin and/or emollients to the mixture.
In clinical trials, alcohol-based hand sanitizers with emollients produced a much lower skin bite and dryness than soap or antimicrobial cleansers.
Allergic contact dermatitis, contact urticaria syndrome or hypersensitivity to alcohol or to additives present in alcohol hand rubs are rare.
A low-level irritant contact dermatitis is attractive compared to washing hands with soap and water.
Whatever their effectiveness, waterless agents cannot wash hands from natural materials, but they simply kill germs.
This is why hand sanitizers are not as effective as soap and water in preventing the spread of many pathogens, as pathogens remain on the hands.
The effectiveness of alcohol-free hand sanitizers depends largely on the ingredients and composition, and they historically are more humiliating than alcohol and alcohol rubs.
Recently, compounds using benzalkonium chloride have shown persistent and increased antimicrobial activity after lubrication, unlike alcohol, which has been shown to reduce the effectiveness after repeated use, which may be the reason for the persistent skin reaction.
Many people in poor communities cannot afford soap and use ashes or soil instead.
Ash or soil may work better than water alone, but it does less than soap.
One concern is that contamination of soil or ash with microorganisms may increase the spread of disease rather than slow it.
Like soap, ash is also a disinfectant because when it is mixed with water, it forms an alkaline mixture.
WHO recommends ash or sand instead of soap if soap is not available.
The proper handwashing procedure recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control for prevention of transmission of disease includes the following:
Wash your hands with running hot or cold water.
Running water is recommended because standing buses may be contaminated, and the cold or hot state of the water does not seem to make a difference.
Rub your hands with enough soap, including the back of the hands, between the fingers, and under the nails.
Soap raises bacteria on the skin, and studies show that people are more likely to wash their hands properly when soap is available than when they use only water.
Sit for at least 20 seconds.
Rubbing causes heat, which helps to remove germs from the skin, and prolonged rubbing removes additional germs.
Clean thoroughly under running water.
Washing the sink can contaminate the hands
Dry them with a clean towel or let them dry in the air.
Wet and damp hands are prone to pick up dirt. The easily forgotten areas are the thumb, the forefinger, the middle areas of the fingers, and the under nails.
Worn-out artificial nails and nail polish can absorb microorganisms.
A moisturizer is often recommended to keep hands dry; dry skin can lead to skin damage that can increase exposure to infection.
Different low-cost systems can be developed to meet hand sanitization when tap water and/or soap are not available e.g. pouring water by hanging a bowl or drum with suitable holes and/or using ash if necessary in developing countries. In situations with limited water supply (such as schools or rural areas in developing countries), there are alternative water-saving techniques, such as "tippy-taps" and other cost-saving methods.
Tippy-tap is a simple technique that involves using a drum tied to a rope, a foot-operated handle that pours a small amount of water into the hands, and a handful of soap.
Effective hand drying is an important part of the hand hygiene process, but there is controversy about the best method of drying in public sanitary facilities.
A growing body of research suggests that paper towels are better in terms of cleanliness than the electric air dryers found in laundry facilities.
In 2008, a study led by the University of Westminster, London, and sponsored by the European Tissue Symposium, a paper towel industry, compared the hygiene standards found in paper towels, hot-air hand dryers, and the latest high-speed hand dryers.
After washing and drying hands with a hot air dryer, the total number of germs was found to be on average 194% on the pads and 254% on the fingertips.
Rapid air drying succeeded in increasing the average total number of bacteria on the pads by 42% and on the fingertips by 15%.
After washing and drying hands with a paper towel, the total number of viruses decreased on average on finger pads by 76% and on fingertips by up to 77%. The scientists also took a test that could reveal whether there was a chance of infection of the users of the laundry and the laundry as a result of each drying method.
The quick-air dryer, which blows the air out at a rated speed of 180 m/s (650 km/h; 400 mph), succeeded in blowing the microorganisms into the hand and onto the skin and nearly infecting other users and the laundry area at a distance of about two meters.
The use of hot air has dispersed microorganisms up to 0.25 meters from the dryer.
Paper towels did not show any noticeable spread of microorganisms.In 2005, a study led by TÜV Produkt und Umwelt tested different hand drying methods.
The following change in the number of bacteria after drying hands was observed:
Many manufacturers of hand dryers are available, and hand dryers have been compared to paper towels.
Hand washing with hand sanitizer is another option when you are traveling without soap and water.
Alcohol-based hand sanitizer must contain at least 60% alcohol.
Medical handwashing became mandatory long after Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis discovered its efficacy (in 1846) in preventing disease in the hospital setting.
Electronic devices provide a signal that reminds hospital staff to wash their hands when they forget.
One study found a reduction in disease rates by its effectiveness.
Medical handwashing lasts 15 seconds, using plenty of soap and water or gel to lubricate or massage each part of the hands.
The hands must be rubbed together by rubbing fingers together.
If there is dirt under the nails, a bristle brush can be used to remove it.
Since germs can live in the water on hands, it is important to clean them thoroughly and wipe them dry with a clean towel.
After drying, a paper towel should be used to close the water (and open any exit door if necessary).
This avoids re-soiling the hands with those areas.
The purpose of handwashing in a healthcare setting is to remove pathogenic microorganisms ("germs") and avoid transmitting them.
The New England Journal of Medicine reports that the practice of handwashing continues to be tolerated at an unacceptable level in many medical settings, with a growing number of doctors and nurses continuing to forget to wash their hands before touching patients, thus transmitting microorganisms.
One study showed that hand washing and other simple procedures can reduce the incidence of catheter-related bloodstream infections by 66 percent. The World Health Organization has published a document that outlines the practice of hand washing and hand rubbing in health care.
The organization's revised guidelines for hand hygiene can be found on its website for public comment.
A proper review was conducted by Whitby et al.
Store-bought devices can measure and verify hand hygiene, if demonstration and compliance with the law is required.
The World Health Organization has "five seasons" for hand washing:
after exposure to blood/blood fluid
before aseptic activity, and
Cold-pressing chemicals ("medicated" or "antibacterial") give the hand sanitizer a lethal effect.
Such lethal force may be needed before surgery or in situations where antibiotic-resistant organisms are abundant. To 'rub' someone's hands for surgery, a tap that can be opened and closed without touching is necessary, a chlorhexidine or iodine wash, sterile hand dryers after cleaning, and a sterile brush and other sterile nail-cleaning instrument.
All ornaments must be removed.
This procedure requires washing the hands and arms to the elbow, usually for 2-6 minutes.
Long periods of rubbing (10 minutes) are not necessary.
When you move, the water in the arms must be prevented from running back to the hands.
After the hand washing is completed, the hands are dried with a sterile cloth or a surgical garment is worn.
To reduce the spread of the virus, it is best to wash or disinfect your hands before and after caring for a sick person.
To control staphylococcal infections in hospitals, it has been found that the greatest benefit from hand hygiene comes from the first 20 percent of cleaning, and the additional benefit is much smaller when repeated hand washing is increased by more than 35 percent.
A comparison of hand-rubbing with alcohol-based solution and hand-rubbing with antibacterial soap for a median time of 30 seconds each showed that the alcohol hand-rubbing reduced bacterial contamination 26% more than the antibacterial soap.
But soap and water are more effective than alcohol-based hand rubs in reducing H1N1 influenza A virus and Clostridium difficile spores on the hands.Interventions to improve hand hygiene in health care settings may include teaching workers about hand hygiene, promoting the availability of alcohol-based hand rubs, and written and oral reminders to workers.
More research is needed to investigate which of these interventions works best in different health care settings.
In developing countries, handwashing with soap is recognized as a cost-effective, vital tool for achieving good health, even physical nutrition.
Yet, the lack of reliable water, soap, or hand sanitizers in homes, schools, and workplaces makes it a challenge to meet global hand sanitization standards.
For example, in many rural areas in Africa hand sanitizers near private or public toilets are scarce, although inexpensive ways to build hand sanitizers are available.
However, poor hand-washing standards may be more likely to cause entrenched habits than lack of soap or water.
Advertising and representation of handwashing with soap can influence legal decisions, raise awareness of the benefits of handwashing and lead to changes in social practices.
For this to work effectively, monitoring and tracking are essential.
A systematic review of 70 studies found that community-based approaches are effective in promoting handwashing in LMICs, while social advertising campaigns are less effective.One example of school handwashing advertising is UNICEF's "Three-Star Approach" which encourages schools to take simple, cost-effective steps to ensure that students wash their hands with soap, among other hygiene requirements.
When minimum standards are met, schools can go from one to three stars.
Handwashing facilities may be part of handwashing promotions to reduce infant deaths.
World Handwashing Day is one example of vigilant campaigns that try to achieve a change in habits.As a result of the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic, UNICEF advertised the widespread use of handwashing emoji.
A few studies have considered the overall cost of hand sanitation in developing countries and the relationship with the prevention of DALYs.
One review, however, suggests that advertising handwashing with soap is more cost-effective than other water and sanitation interventions.
The importance of hand hygiene for human health  especially for people under vulnerable conditions such as new mothers or wounded soldiers in hospitals  was first recognized in the mid-19th century by two pioneers of hand hygiene: Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis who worked in Vienna, Austria, and Florence Nightingale, English "founder of modern nursing".
At that time many still believed that disease was caused by the bad odors called miasmas.
In the 1980's, foodborne and medical-related outbreaks led the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to increasingly promote hand-washing as an important way to prevent the spread of disease.
The 2009 swine flu outbreak and the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic have led to heightened vigilance in many countries about the importance of hand washing with soap to protect against this type of infectious disease.
For example, signs with the inscription "proper handwashing procedure" are hung above handwashing sinks in public toilets and in toilets in office buildings and airports in Germany.
The expression "wash your hands" of something, means to make it clear that you do not want someone else to take responsibility for or be involved in something.
Its origin is in the Bible passage in Matthew where Pontius Pilate washed his hands in making the decision to crucify Jesus Christ, but it has become a widely used saying in some English societies.
In Shakespeare's Macbeth, Lady Macbeth first washes her hands in an effort to cleanse herself of supposed defilement, representing a guilty conscience for crimes she had committed and persuaded her husband to commit.
It was also found that people, after remembering or thinking about improper actions, are more likely to wash their hands more often than others, and are more likely to appreciate the importance of hand sanitizers.
Furthermore, when they are not allowed to wash their hands afterward they are less likely to share in repentant acts of "cleansing", such as volunteering.
Religion promotes hand washing for both a purely hygienic and a symbolic purpose. The symbolic practice of washing hands, using water but without soap to wash hands, is part of the hand washing practice that exists in many religions, including the Bahá'í Faith, Hinduism, tevilah and netilat yadayim in Judaism, Lavabo in Christianity, and Buddhism in Islam.
Hinduism, Judaism, and Islam require hand washing after using the toilet.
Also, Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, Judaism, and Islam require washing of hands before and after eating.
Workplace controls for the risk of COVID-19
COVID-19 workplace hazard controls are the implementation of occupational safety and health hazard control procedures in the prevention of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
Proper workplace hazard controls depend on the workplace and type of work, based on evaluation of risk of exposure sources, community severity, and hazards to individual workers who may be vulnerable to COVID-19.
According to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), low-risk jobs have low levels of social interaction with other workers, for which simple protective measures are recommended, including hand washing, encouraging workers to stay home when sick, good breathing habits, and maintaining a clean and disinfected workplace.
Medium-risk occupations include those that require frequent and close contact with unknown or suspected COVID-19 people, but may become infected through continued social transmission or foreign travel.
This includes workers with contact with the general public such as schools, crowded workplaces, and crowded retail environments.
Risk controls in this group, in addition to simple virus prevention measures, include ventilation using high-efficiency air filters, sneeze guards, and having personal protective equipment available in cases where a person is found to have COVID-19.
OSHA considers health and cold workers who are exposed to people known or suspected of having COVID-19 to be at high risk of exposure, which puts them at a higher risk of exposure if workers perform aerosol-generating procedures or collect or handle specimens from people known or suspected of having COVID-19.
Suitable hazard controls for these occupations include building controls such as negative pressure ventilation rooms, and appropriate personal protective equipment at work.
The outbreak of COVID-19 can have serious consequences within the workplace.
Employees may be absent from work because of illness, the need to care for others, or the fear of exposure.
Sales practices may change, in both the type of goods demanded, and the means of obtaining these goods (such as shopping during off-peak hours or by delivery or by driving through services).
Finally, the delivery of supplies from areas hardest hit by COVID-19 may be disrupted.Epidemic preparedness and response plan can be used to guide preventive actions.
Programs consider the levels of risk involved in different workplaces and types of work, including the type of exposure, hazards that arise in the home or social setting, and hazards to individual workers such as advanced age or chronic disease conditions.
They also outline appropriate controls to meet those risks, and the following schemes for conditions that may arise as a result of an outbreak.
Preparedness for infectious disease and response plans may depend on the encouragement of state or provincial law.
The goals of the outbreak response include reducing labor overreach, protecting people at high risk of serious health problems, maintaining business operations, and reducing the harsh impact on other businesses and purchasing suppliers.
The severity of the disease in the community in which the business is located affects the response measures taken.
Risk management ladders are a widely used framework in occupational safety and health to combine risk management with outcomes.
When COVID-19 risks are not eliminated, the most effective control is building control, followed by management controls, and finally personal protective equipment.
Construction controls involve securing workers from work-related hazards without relying on worker practice, and they can be a very cost-effective step when installed.
Controls for managing changes in employment law or procedures requiring employee or employer action
Personal protective equipment (PPE) is considered to be less effective than structural and managerial controls, but it can help avoid certain exposures.
All types of PPE must be selected based on the risk to the worker, worn appropriately as appropriate (e.g., respirators), worn regularly and appropriately, inspected regularly, stored, and replaced, as necessary, and properly removed, cleaned, and stored or or disposed of to avoid contamination.
According to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), low-exposure jobs have little social contact with other peer workers.
Simple measures of disinfection recommended in all workplaces include frequent and thorough hand washing, encouraging workers to stay home if sick, good breathing habits including covering up coughs and sneezing, providing tissue and tray ingredients, arranging for homework or different shifts as needed, encouraging workers to avoid using other tools and equipment, and maintaining a clean and disinfecting process in the workplace.
Early detection and isolation of those who may be infected is an important step in protecting employees, customers, contractors, and others in the workplace.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that workers with symptoms of acute respiratory illness should stay at home until the temperature is low, with other symptoms for at least 24 hours without using heat-lowering or symptom-relieving medications, and that sick days rules be flexible, allow workers to stay at home to care for a sick family member, and that employees know these rules.
According to OSHA, medium exposure jobs include those jobs that require regular or close contact at a distance of six feet (1.8 m) with strangers who are suspected to be COVID-19 patients, have SARS-CoV-2 as a result of ongoing transmission in the community near the workplace, or because someone has recently returned from a foreign country that is a potential site of COVID-19 transmission.
These include workers with general public contact such as schools, overcrowded workplaces, and high-status retail environments. Building controls for these high-risk groups includes installing low-level air filters for operation, increasing ventilation levels, installing restrictions such as plastic sneeze monitors, and installing a driver-pass window for customer service. Management controls for this high-risk workplace include encouraging sick workers to stay at home, establishing a virtual contact system that allows employees to access a face-to-face meeting space, ensuring that employees are able to travel safely to areas with COVID-19, building programs that can provide training, training, and training on how to respond to the needs of workers, including masks, face-to-face contact, training, and education on how to use personal protective equipment, including face-to-face contact, face-to-face contact, and the use of masks, face-to-face contact, and face-to-face contact.
Workers in this exposure group rarely need to use respirators.
If someone becomes ill on a plane, proper controls for the reactions of crew and other passengers include keeping the sick person at a distance of six shoulders, assigning one crew member to care for the sick person, and giving a face mask to the sick person or asking the sick person to cover his mouth and nose with tissue when coughing or sneezing.
Cabin crew must wear gloves when caring for a sick passenger or when touching bodily fluids or potentially contaminated areas, and additional protective gear may be required if the patient has a fever, persistent cough, and difficulty breathing.
Gloves and other disposable items should be disposed of in a biohazard bag, and contaminated areas should be cleaned and disinfected later. For commercial ships, including cruise ships and other passenger transportation, control of dengue includes postponing trips when sick, and isolating and informing an indoor health center immediately if someone develops fever or other symptoms while on board.
If possible, medical follow-up should take place in the self-isolating person's cabin.In schools and kindergartens, the CDC recommends temporary closures for cleaning and disinfection if an infected person has been inside the school building regardless of the spread.
If there is a mild to moderate infection in the community, strategies for quarantine by stay may be implemented such as cancelling field trips, meetings, and other large gatherings such as environmental education, choir classes or cafeteria meals, increasing the space between desks, arriving at half-time and departing at times, isolating nonessential visitors, and using a separate health office space for children with flu-like symptoms.
When the virus spreads significantly in the community, despite efforts to keep people apart, extended school closures may be considered. For law enforcement officers who perform daily duties, the health risk at that time is considered low by the CDC.
Law enforcement personnel who must contact confirmed or suspected COVID-19 patients are encouraged to follow the same guidelines as emergency medical personnel, including proper personal protective equipment.
In the event of excessive contact with the victim, workers should clean and disinfect their work belts and clothing before reusing them with a spray or household cleaner, and follow standard procedures to prevent the spread of the virus and to dispose of used PPE and to store and wash clothes.
OSHA considers that some medical and cosmetic workers are at high or very high risk of exposure.
High-risk occupations include medical shippers, first responders, laboratory workers, and workers who transport medical supplies to known or suspected COVID-19 patients.
These are the greatest risks of exposure if workers perform procedures that initiate aerosol, or collect or handle samples, from known or suspected COVID-19 patients.
Aerosol-based procedures include a tube implant, cough-inducing procedures, bronchoscopies, dental procedures and tests, or body samples.
High-risk cold exposure activities include workers involved in preparing the bodies of people with known or suspected cases of COVID-19 when they die; these become the most dangerous when they examine the bodies. Additional engineering controls for these high-risk groups include quarantine rooms for known or suspected COVID-19 patients, including when aerosol procedures are performed.
Special ventilation with a pressure-sensitive airway may be appropriate in some medical and refrigeration settings.
Samples should be handled in accordance with Biosafety Level 3 safety guidelines.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that incoming patients be isolated and placed in separate waiting areas depending on suspected COVID-19 status.In addition to the PPE, OSHA recommends respirators for those who work within 6 feet of patients known, or suspected, to have SARS-CoV-2, and those who perform procedures that initiate aerosol.
In the United States, NIOSH-approved N95 or better filter face masks must be used as part of a comprehensive written respirator protection program, which includes fitness tests, exercise, and medical examinations.
Some types of respirators can provide greater protection and improve the comfort of the worker. WHO does not recommend covers, because COVID-19 is a disease transmitted by inhalation and not by body fluids.
WHO only recommends surgical masks for filter workers at entry points.
For those who collect respiratory samples, care for, or transport COVID-19 patients without aerosol testing procedures, WHO recommends surgical masks, eyeglasses, or face shields, a towel, and gloves.
When an aerosol procedure is performed, the surgical mask is replaced with either an N95 or an FFP2 respirator.
Because PPE is not available enough in the world, WHO recommends reducing the need for PPE through telephone contact with patients, practical restrictions such as screen windows, which only allow those directly involved in treatment to enter a room with a COVID-19 patient, use only the PPE needed for a specific task, continue to use the same respirator without removing it while caring for multiple patients with the same disease, monitor and control the availability of PPE, and prohibit the use of masks for people without symptoms.

HATHEM: [Covid-19] Reducing the burden and preparing for the future
The following is a list of the most commonly used terms:
License: CC0: No rights reserved
We find ourselves in a remarkable position this month.
The COVID-19 pandemic is a remarkable example of how people around the world are connected and how we have responsibilities to one another.
We have never faced challenges like this, but we know that our response depends on the kind of global sympathy, cooperation, and community building that is the backbone of this organization.
The cooperation and attention we have seen from all our employees through e-mails, phone calls, and chats is a remarkable guarantee that we have good people we are fortunate to work with.
I am truly happy and proud to work with you.
Last week, someone told me how much he appreciated our work.
It reminded me how logical it is for the world to be able to open Wikipedia right now, and this is a powerful sign of this important resource to be always available online and available to everyone.
Your work makes this possible, whether you keep the sites open or our employees paid or our communities secure.
The world needs the information available on Wikipedia, now more than ever.
This is a time when not only what we do but also how we do it will have a profound impact on the earth.
Because of the importance of this work and your role in it, we will make major changes in the way we deal with one another, starting next week.
Changes in our work and schedules
As Robyn mentioned earlier, the c-team met last night to discuss how we would work with our schedule for the days and months ahead.
In that discussion, we considered what we felt would be the best response to what we are facing and the best way to keep the organization going during this time.
We were hoping to relieve stress and support our long-term goal.
If you need to call again, fine.
For all employees, contracting companies, and contract workers:
our expected daily work will be about 4 hours a day, or 20 hours a week until the change is announced.
We do not announce a holiday - if you can work regular overtime, the company may hire you.
However, things are uncertain in the world now, and whether you need to care for loved ones, shop for food, or see a doctor, your health comes first.
It will not track your working hours.
If you are sick, do not work.
We don't really need to say this, but we will.
You do not have to enter sick days or PTO - you will simply tell your manager and help your team rearrange calendars and schedules to ensure that key parts of the work are being accomplished.
(If you are diagnosed with COVID-19, please inform Bryan during T&C Ops so that T&C can assist with support and ensure that your situation is properly handled by the authorities).
The hourly workers will be paid full wages.
We have already said so, and we are diligent in fulfilling our obligations to our contract workers and to those who work overtime.
Each will be paid according to the normal hours worked under normal conditions.
This includes when you are sick and unable to work.
If you want to work, we support you.
Many people use work as a way to balance their stress with the world around them.
What we do can be of unique value, especially in times like these.
Again, it is important to take care of yourself.
We invite you to contact your manager, so that we can know what to expect and plan accordingly.
Some work is considered essential.
There are things we must continue to do.
SRE, HR Ops, Trust & Safety, and Fundraising teams (among others) perform critical tasks that may require additional support.
We will initiate a process with all departments to review the current goals and shift our focus to supporting what is important to our goal.
We all have a lot to do, and we will all be focused on the most important projects.
Slowing down now will not hurt us later.
We do not plan to work overtime to keep up with the schedule once the pandemic is over.
You will not be expected to work overtime to finish a job at an unusual time now.
We accept that circumstances have changed, and we will work to set new goals and times when appropriate.
What happened to the APP (Annual Planning)?
To adapt to our new circumstances and the expected daily work hours, we intend to change the timing of the delivery of our 2020-2021 Annual Plan.
Our intention is to propose an extension of our 2019-2020 plan that allows more time to budget to allow employees to do critical tasks first, take care of themselves, and care for their loved ones while also helping those who need or wish to work a reduced schedule in the next few weeks.
This extended work period greatly reduces the current work schedule and the pressure on the entire organization.
We will present our proposal to the Board next week and review the representatives and delegations on the next steps as soon as we have confirmation.
We thank the APP team for taking the lead in this.
Office environment, exposure, and cleaning
Last week, we learned that one of our SF employees may have been exposed to the COVID-19 virus.
However, out of great concern, we sent a disinfection team to disinfect all the San Francisco office space.
Use hospital disinfectant soap to disinfect the entire area, including the reception area and the elevator entrances.
The building implements its maintenance protocol through the use of products that support the safety of its tenants.
We feel reassured that the office will be ready when we decide to return.
Our DC office is at WeWork, which shared its COVID-19 protocol with all DC staff.
As of last week, our DC office has moved to a remote location that is fully set up in accordance with the direction given to San Francisco.
As some of our NYC employees knew, we had been discussing renting a property in Brooklyn.
These discussions are ongoing but may take time.
Some of our employees are working remotely for the first time.
Our longtime remote workers know that it can be a big change, and they want to give you a suggestion:
Reduce the length of the meetings to at least one or two hours.
If long meetings are needed, consider how to divide them into several days.
Explain clearly what the meeting is about, have an agenda, and send in the material to be studied in advance.
Do it regularly with video, using tools like Google Docs and Zoom to work together and communicate live.
Have someone take the lead in organizing all the meetings, someone look at the questions and follow up on the list of speakers, and someone help take notes (or take notes together).
Email technical support if you need a suitable headset.
Spend your social security money on chewing gum.
Join the #remoties channel on Slack to discuss the project with your colleagues
The HR Operations team seeks guidance in online seminars on effective ways to support the expansion of workloads across the Company.
This past week we asked all social donors to cancel Wikimedia-sponsored public events, such as editathons, until WHO announces that the pandemic is over.
We will let them know that we understand that our cancellation request and other restrictions may make it impossible to complete their agreed-upon backlog of payments and that no one will be fined for delay or change of those terms.
This coming week we will follow up with further guidance at Wikimania and other regional and regional public conferences.
The general public sentiment around the world seems to be frustrated by the disruption but relieved by the clarification and opportunities to focus on their communities, Wikimedia and so on.
Over time, CRT is working to set up a page on Meta-Wiki to provide a public space to look at the contributions and follow our discussions with them.
Keeping in touch with COVID-19 related news
We will send an invitation to your calendars next Thursday, 14:00 UTC/07:00 PT for a special staff meeting.
We will use this time to share more updates, answer your questions, and spend some time in touch.
We work together and will help you wherever we can.
In the meantime, you can continue to receive information from this email, and all other important COVID-19-related information, on the Office Wiki.
The CRT will keep these updated pages and all information in one place.
We also work to maintain regular contact with workers living in the countries currently most affected.
If you have questions about travel, events, the main work route, the garage challenge, or anything else you may need help with, please do not hesitate to tell and work with CRT.
We are here to help with support and coordination if needed.
If you have a confidential or sensitive matter, please email Bryan Judan - Director of HR International Global Operations.
None of these changes should be viewed as a cessation of our work and responsibilities.
Rather, it is an awareness that in this time, our work and obligations will likely need to be balanced as never before.
These are steps we believe are necessary to support each other to continue the work, give our team the support it needs, and give the land the service it relies on.
The work we have planned will be waiting for the time to come.
In the meantime, it is time to support one another and to create space for the important work that may be in store for the weeks and months ahead.
We need all of you to make that possible, so we need all of you to take care of yourselves and your families so that you are fully prepared when the need arises.
Now, please -- wash your hands and don't touch your face!
The following are the results of the study: Catherine, CRT (Amanda K, Amy V, Bryan J, Doreen D, Gregory V, Jaime V, Joel L, Lynette L, Ryan M, and Tony S), and the rest of the Leadership Team (Grant I, Heather W, Jaime V, Janeen U, Lisa S, Robyn A, Ryan M, and Toby N).
B'Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is an enzyme that is located on the outer (cell membrane) surface of cells in the lungs, arteries, heart, kidneys, and intestines.
ACE2 opposes the activity of the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) by reducing the amount of angiotensin-II and increasing Ang (((1-7) making it a promising drug for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases. ACE2 also acts as a cell entry point for certain coronaviruses.
The human form of the enzyme is commonly referred to as hACE2.
Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 is a zinc-containing metalloenzyme found on the surface of endothelial and other cells.
The ACE2 protein contains the N-terminal peptidase M2 domain and the C-terminal collectrin renal amino acid transporter domain.
ACE2 is a single-pass membrane type I protein, with its enzyme-activated domain exposed to the surface of cells in the lungs and other tissues.
The extracellular domain of ACE2 is separated from the transmembrane domain by an enzyme known as sheddase, and the resulting soluble protein is excreted into the blood and eventually into the urine.
ACE2 is present in many body tissues: ACE2 is bound to the cell membrane of mostly type II alveolar cells, small intestinal enterocytes, arterial and venous endothelial cells, and arterial smooth tissue cells in many body tissues.
ACE2 mRNA is also found in the cerebral cortex, the striatum, the hypothalamus, and the brainstem.
The primary function of ACE2 is to act as an ACE balance.
ACE breaks down the hormone angiotensin I into the vasoconstricting angiotensin II.
ACE2 separates the carboxyl-terminal amino acid phenylalanine from angiotensin II (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe) and then separates it into the vasodilator angiotensin (1-7), (H-Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-OH).
ACE2 can also break down several other peptides including [des-Arg9]-bradykinin, apelin, neurotensin, dynorphin A, and ghrelin.
ACE2 also regulates the membrane movement of the neutral amino acid transporter SLC6A19 and has been implicated in Hartnup disease.
As a transmembrane protein, ACE2 serves as a major entry point into the cells of certain coronaviruses, including HCoV-NL63; SARS-CoV (virus that causes SARS); and SARS-CoV-2 (virus that causes COVID-19).
Specifically, the association of the SARS-CoV S1 spike protein with SARS-CoV2 in the ACE2 enzyme domain on the surface of cells results in endocytosis and the movement of both the virus and the enzyme to the endosomes between cells.
This entry process also requires activation of the S protein by the serine protease TMPRSS2, an inhibitor currently under investigation as a potential treatment for the disease. This has led some to conclude that reducing ACE2 levels in cells, can help fight the virus.
However, several leading organizations and working bodies have encouraged continuation of the standard ACE inhibitor and ARB therapy.
"A planned review and analysis published on July 11, 2012, found that ""the use of ACE inhibitors was associated with a 34% greater reduction in the risk of pneumonia compared to controls"."
"In addition, ""the risk of pneumonia has been reduced in patients treated with ACE inhibitors who were at high risk of pneumonia, especially those with stroke and heart disease".
"The use of ACE inhibitors has also been associated with a decrease in pneumonia deaths, although the effects were less severe than the damage that pneumonia might cause.
The human compound ACE2 (rhACE2) is thought to be a novel treatment for severe lung damage, and appears to improve pulmonary hemodynamics in pigs with lipopolysaccharide-induced acute respiratory distress syndrome.
Half of rhACE2 in humans takes 10 hours to work and starts working after 30 minutes over a 24-hour period.
Some studies suggest that rhACE2 may be an appropriate treatment for those who cannot take regular renin-angiotensin system inhibitors (RAS inhibitors) or for diseases in which the predictor of angiotensin II is elevated.
"b'COVID-19 apps are mobile software applications designed to help you find out numbers regarding the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic, as a process to find people ("contact" people) who may have come into contact with an infected person".
Several programs have been developed or contemplated, with the support of government legislation in some places.
Frameworks have been developed to build contact tracking apps.
Privacy concerns have been raised, particularly regarding systems based on tracking the location of app users.
Other non-secret methods include the use of Bluetooth signals to track the location of the user on other cell phones.
On 10 April 2020, Google and Apple announced that they would develop a way to support such Bluetooth apps directly on Android and iOS OS.
In China, the Chinese government, in partnership with Alipay, has developed an app that allows citizens to check if they have been in contact with people with COVID-19.
In Singapore, an app called TraceTogether is used.
"The app was developed by local IT staff, released as an open-source project and will be provided by the government. In North Macedonia, a Bluetooth-enabled app called ""StopKorona!"" was launched to track exposure to people who may have the virus and provide a quick response to health authorities".
The app was developed by the Department of Communications and Technology and the Department of Health.
As of 14 April 2020, the app was awaiting approval by the Google Play Store and Apple App Store.
"On 12 April, the government said that the tracking app was in an advanced stage of development, and would be available for release in a few weeks. A similar app is being prepared in Ireland, and France ("StopCovid"")".
Both Australia and New Zealand are considering apps based on Singapore's TraceTogether app and BlueTrace protocol.Russia intends to launch a border-tracking app for COVID-19 diagnosed patients living in Moscow, designed to ensure that they do not leave home.
Ross Anderson, a professor of security engineering at Cambridge University, lists several potential problems with app systems, including misleading warnings and the likelihood of not getting a warning if the app's power is limited to only a small number of people.
"To address concerns about the spread of misleading or harmful ""coronavirus"" apps, Apple has placed restrictions on the types of organizations that can install coronavirus apps on its App Store, saying it will only be ""official"" or trusted organizations".
Google and Amazon have set similar limits.
Privacy partners have expressed concern about the problems of mass tracking using coronavirus apps, especially about the fact that the tracking system created to handle the coronavirus pandemic will be dismantled once the threat is over.
Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations have issued a statement setting limits on this type of tracking.
These organizations have set nine criteria for government projects:
"the search should be ""legal, necessary and appropriate"";
the extension of the surveillance and tracking period shall be subject to sunset conditions;
data use should be limited to COVID-19 purposes;
data security and anonymity will need to be protected and demonstrated as protected on the basis of evidence;
digital testing should avoid reducing the harm of discrimination and undervaluing things;
any sharing of data with other parties will have to be legally defined;
there should be vigilance against abuse and citizens' rights to respond to abuse;
"effective participation by all ""stakeholders"" will be required, including public health professionals and small groups. The German Chaos Computer Club (CCC) and Reporters Without Borders (Reporter ohne Grenzen) (RSF) have also issued checklists".
The proposed Google/Apple program aims to fix the problem of constant tracking by removing tracking functionality from device OSes when no longer needed.
Some countries have used network-based location tracking instead of apps, eliminating both the need to download an app and to avoid being tracked.
In Israel, network-based tracking was authorized.
Network-based solutions with access to unfiltered local data can have serious privacy issues.
However, not all systems with large servers need to gain access to a person's location data; a number of privacy protection systems have been developed that use large servers only for communication (see section below).
In South Korea, a non-app-based system was used to track a person.
Instead of using a designated app, the system collects tracking information from various sources including mobile device tracking data and credit card data, and combines these to send text message notifications to people who may have the virus.
In addition to using this information to warn people who may have the virus, the government is also making local information available to the public, which is permitted because of many changes in privacy laws after the MERS outbreak in that country.
Countries including Germany are considering both large-scale and private systems.
As of 6 April 2020, the data has not been released.
Privacy-friendly tracking is a well-designed approach, with numerous research papers dating back to at least 2013.As of 7 April 2020, more than a dozen expert groups were looking for privacy-friendly solutions, such as using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) to connect the user to other mobile phones.
However, PEPP-PT is a linkage effort that consists of both large and diverse protocols, and is not a single protocol.Different protocols include Decentralized Privacy-Preserving Proximity Tracing (DP-PPT/DP-3T), Temporary Contact Numbers (TCN, FKA Contact Event Numbers, CEN), Privacy Sensitive Protocols and Mechanisms for Mobile Contact Tracing (PACT) among others.
In these protocols, the physical data of a person never leaves the device, and all matching takes place on the device.
The Privacy Group at MIT Media Lab has been developing SafePaths, a platform to use privacy-protection techniques when collecting and using location or shortcut data to track the spread of COVID-19.
"Based on research from the white paper ""Apps Gone Rogue: Maintaining Personal Privacy in an Epidemic"" released in March 2020. Another similar effort is the SafeTrace platform of Enigma MPC, a privacy technology company originally founded at MIT Media Lab".
SafeTrace uses secure hardware technology to allow users to share sensitive geographic and health data with other users and law enforcement, without compromising the privacy of that data.
On 5 April 2020, the global TCN Coalition was formed by groups united by what were similar and widely divergent protocols, with the goal of reducing fragmentation, and allowing for the global use of tracking and warning apps, a key element in widespread adoption.
On 9 April 2020, the Singapore government announced that it had made an invitation for the BlueTrace protocol used by its official government app.
On 10 April 2020, Google and Apple, the companies that control the Android and iOS mobile platforms, announced a tracking system, and claimed that it would protect privacy, based on a combination of Bluetooth Low Energy technology and privacy-protecting cryptography.
They also published technical features of the system.
According to Apple and Google, the system is intended to be released in three stages:
release of tools to allow governments to create legal applications that track coronavirus and protect privacy
installing this feature directly into the iOS and Android systems of Google and Apple to fix startup problems and continuous monitoring by first sending the system with OS updates, and later removing it in the same way once the threat has passed.
B'Drug repositioning (also known as drug reuse, re-profiling, re-tasking, or therapeutic switching) is the reuse of an authorized drug to treat another disease or health condition different from the one for which it was designed.
This is the type of scientific research currently being conducted to develop safe and effective treatments for COVID-19.
Other research guidelines include the development of a COVID-19 vaccine and convalescent plasma transfusion.SARS-CoV-2 has approximately 66 drug-activating proteins, each with multiple sites where molecules fuse.
Analysis of such collection sites has developed a sensible project to develop an antiviral against COVID-19 proteins.
Of the target proteins most important for SARS-CoV-2 are the papain-like protease, RNA-based RNA polymerase, helicase, S protein, and ADP ribophosphatase.
Hussein A A, and others are investigating several potential drugs and then developing and analyzing their structural similarity to similar high-level authorized drugs to accelerate the development of a potent anti-SARS-CoV-2 drug in this pre-treatment study that could be used as a research drug.
Chloroquine is a malaria drug that is also used for certain immune-mediated diseases.
On March 18, WHO announced that chloroquine and its related hydroxychloroquine will be among four drugs being studied as part of a Combined Clinical Study.
New York State Governor Andrew Cuomo announced that the New York State study of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine will begin on March 24. On March 28, the FDA authorized the use of hydroxychloroquine sulfate and chloroquine phosphate under the Emergency Use Authorization (EUA).
This treatment has not yet been approved by the FDA's medical research process and is only approved under the EUA as an investigational treatment for emergency use in hospitalized patients but who are unable to accept treatment in a medical study.
"CDC has stated that ""the use, dosage, or duration of hydroxychloroquine in prophylaxis or treatment of SARS-CoV-2 virus"" is not appropriate".
"Doctors said they used the drug when ""there was no other option""".
A Turkish research team in Istanbul is conducting a small study on the use of chloroquine in combination with zinc, vitamin A, vitamin C, and vitamin D.
Large-scale research is underway at Duke University and the University of Oxford.
The NYU Langone Medical School is conducting research on the safety and efficacy of hydroxychloroquine for disease prevention.
"Chinese medical research in Wuhan and Shenzhen says favipiravir appears to be ""really effective""".
35 patients in Shenzhen were diagnosed with gout in the trial within 4 days, while the duration of the illness was 11 days in 45 patients who did not.
In a study conducted in Wuhan of 240 patients with pneumonia, half were given favipiravir and the other half were givenumifenovir.
The Italian Pharmaceutical Agency reminded the public that the evidence to support the drug is limited and pre-existing.
On April 2, Germany announced that it would buy the drug from Japan and stockpile it, and then use the military to send the drug to university hospitals, where the drug will be used to treat COVID-19 patients.
According to the South China Morning Post, Shinzo Abe has introduced himself to Trump's cabinet about buying a drug. The drug may not work completely in severe cases of illness where the virus has multiplied.
It may not be safe for pregnant women or for those trying to conceive.
"Another study of lopinavir/ritonavir (Kaletra), a combination of the antiviral drugs lopinavir and ritonavir, concluded that ""no benefit was found""".
These drugs were designed to prevent HIV from multiplying by interacting with protease.
A team of researchers at the University of Colorado is trying to modify drugs to find a fluid that will interact with the protease of SARS-CoV-2.There are critics in the scientific community for steering efforts toward reusing drugs specifically designed for HIV/AIDS.
WHO has included lopinavir/ritonavir in a global Integrated Study.
Remdesivir was developed and developed by Gilead Sciences as a treatment for the Ebola virus and Marburg diseases. Gilead Sciences found that Remdesivir had antiviral activity in vitro against philo-, pneumo-, paramyxo-, and corona-virus.
One problem with antiviral therapy is the development of a treatment with mutations that can lead to a more serious and contagious disease.
Preliminary studies suggest that remdesivir may have a high genetic resistance to drug reactions.Several clinical studies are underway, including two being conducted at Cleveland University Hospitals; one in moderate-to-severe patients and one in severe patients.
There are three clinical trials underway for vitamin C injections for hospitalized and critically ill patients with COVID-19; two placebo (China, Canada) and one uncontrolled (Italy).
The State of New York began a study of the antibiotic azithromycin on 24 March 2020.

A Phase II study of angiotensin-converting enzyme type 2 is underway with 200 patients from critical stages admitted to hospitals in Denmark, Germany, and Austria to see the effectiveness of the treatment.
Researchers at the Montreal Heart Institute in Canada are currently investigating the role of colchicine in reducing inflammation and lung problems in patients with mild symptoms of COVID-19.
The study, called COLCORONA, involved 6,000 adults aged 40 and over who were diagnosed with COVID-19 and had mild symptoms that did not require hospitalization.
Women who are pregnant or who are breast- feeding or who do not have an effective method of contraception are not eligible.
Several anticoagulants are being tested in Italy.
Low-molecular-weight heparin is widely used in the treatment of patients, leading the Italian Medicines Agency to publish guidelines for its use.
A multi-center study of 300 patients investigating the use of enoxaparin sodium in disease prevention and treatment efforts was announced in Italy on April 14.
Since SARS-CoV-2 is a virus, scientists have focused heavily on reusing antiviral drugs that were developed for previous epidemics such as MERS, SARS, and West Nile virus.
Ribavirin: ribavirin was suggested for the treatment of COVID-19 according to schedule 7 of Chinese guidelines
Umifenovir:umifenovir was recommended for the treatment of COVID-19 according to schedule 7 of Chinese guidelines
Some antibiotics that have been found to be reusable in the treatment of COVID-19:
Tocilizumab (Anti-IL-6 receptor): It is approved in China.
In studies also in Italy and China. and see Tocilizumab#COVID-19.
The b'A COVID-19 vaccine is a proposed vaccine against the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
Although no goal has been completed by medical research, there are many ongoing efforts to develop such a goal.
In late February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) said it did not expect a vaccine for SARS-CoV-2, the causative virus, to be available in less than 18 months.
Five vaccine candidates were in Phase I safety studies in April.
COVID-19 was detected in December 2019.
A major outbreak spread around the world in 2020, leading to a massive fundraising and research effort to establish a target.
Many organizations are using genetics to develop potential vaccines for SARS-CoV-2.
Since April, the key elements of the CEPI policy-setting work are being speeded up, refined, produced, and made available on the world stage.
In April, CEPI scientists reported that 10 different technology platforms have been researched and developed in early 2020 to develop an effective vaccine against COVID-19.
Key platform functions that advanced to Phase I security research include:
nucleic acid (DNA and RNA) (founder of Phase I and candidate for the study: Moderna, mRNA-1273)
viral vector (stage I originator and candidate for the vaccine: CanSino Biologics, adenovirus type 5 vector)
As reported by CEPI scientists in April, 115 candidates are in the early stages of vaccine development, while 78 have been confirmed as virulent projects (79, according to the Milken Institute), and 37 have been announced, but very little public information is available (possibly being planned or developed).
Phase II studies evaluate pre-use safety and anti-virus, often unplanned, placebo-controlled, and multi-centered, while looking at more accurate, effective doses.
Phase III studies usually involve more participants, including a control group, and the operation of a vaccine trial to prevent disease, while employing critical outcomes at the appropriate dose.
"Of the 79 vaccine candidates being developed (confirmed as of early April 2020), 74 had not been tested in humans (in ""pre-treatment"" studies").
On 24 January 2020 in Australia, the University of Queensland announced that it is investigating the use of a molecular clamp that will modify the genetic code for viral proteins for therapeutic purposes.

On 29 January 2020, Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies, led by Hanneke Schuitemaker, announced that it had begun work on developing a vaccine.
Janssen also develops a drink-based formula with its partner, Vaxart.
On 18 March 2020, Emergent BioSolutions announced the establishment of a joint venture with Vaxart to establish the policy.
On 8 February 2020, the OncoGen laboratory in Romania published a paper on the design of a vaccine with the same technology as that used in cancer treatment using vaccination with novel immune stimulants.
On March 25 the director of the research center announced that he had reached a conclusion on the mixture of the target and that the testing was about to begin.
On 27 February 2020, Generex's future company, NuGenerex Immuno-Oncology, announced that it was launching a vaccine project to develop a peptide II-Key vaccine against COVID-19.
"They wanted to produce a vaccine that could be tested on humans ""within 90 days"."
On 5 March 2020, Washington University in St. Louis announced its projects to establish the policy.

On 12 March 2020, India's Health Ministry announced that it was working on 11 quarantined people, and that even as fast as it could take at least a year and a half to two years to establish a vaccine.
On 12 March 2020, Medicago, a biotechnology company based in Quebec City, Quebec, reported that it had developed coronavirus-like particles under a small grant from the Canadian Institutes for Health Research.
The vaccine candidate is being studied by the laboratory, and human testing is scheduled for July or August 2020.
"Earlier that week, The Guardian reported that US President Donald Trump had given CureVac ""'huge amounts of money' for Covid-19 vaccine"", while the German government objected".
On 17 March 2020, the American pharmaceutical company Pfizer announced a partnership with the German company BioNTech to jointly develop an mRNA trial.
The mRNA vaccine BNT162, is currently being tested for pre-treatment use and clinical trials are expected to begin in April 2020.
In Italy on 17 March 2020, Takis Biotech, a biotechnology company that integrates biotechnology announced that it will receive the results of pre-treatment testing in April 2020 and its ultimate goal may be to begin human trials in the fall.
In France on 19 March 2020, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) announced an investment of US$4.9 million in a joint COVID-19 vaccine research involving Institut Pasteur, Themis Bioscience (Vienna, Austria), and the University of Pittsburgh, which puts the total investment of CEPI in developing a COVID-19 vaccine at US$29 million.
Other CEPI partners that are investors in the development of the COVID-19 vaccine are Moderna, Curevac, Inovio, Novavax, University of Hong Kong, University of Oxford, and University of Queensland.
On 20 March 2020, Russian health officials announced that scientists had begun testing animals with six different vaccines.
Researchers at Imperial College London announced on 20 March 2020 that they have developed a self-testing RNA test for COVID-19.
The vaccine was developed within 14 days of the discovery of the vaccine in China.
By the end of March, the Canadian government announced C$275 million to fund 96 research projects on COVID-19 treatments, including several projects at Canadian companies and universities, such as projects at Medicago and the University of Saskatchewan.
"At about the same time, the Canadian government announced C$192 million specifically for the development of a COVID-19 vaccine, with plans to establish a national ""vaccine bank"" of several new vaccines that could be used in the event of another coronavirus outbreak".
"On 2 April 2020, researchers at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine reported on the trial of PittCoVacc, a potential COVID-19 vaccine in mice, and noted that ""MNA SARS-CoV-2 S1 vaccines independently released the potent pathogenic effects of the anti-viral pathogen [in mice] that were observed 2 weeks after receiving the vaccine"""
In Canada on 16 April 2020, the University of Waterloo School of Pharmacy announced the development of a DNA-based vaccine that could be a nasal spray.
Using therapeutic viruses, DNA will be made to reproduce within the human virus to produce harmless virus-like molecules, which may stimulate the immune system to produce antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
In March 2020, the government, industry, and three US universities combined hardware to acquire IBM supercomputers, combined with cloud computing assets from Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Amazon, Microsoft, and Google.
Some goals have implications for other organisms, also called implicit effects.
That means they can have the same effects as the disease they prevent.
One random study in Australia sought to enroll 4,170 health workers.
The goals set may not be safe or effective.
Initial studies to evaluate vaccine efficacy using animal models of COVID-19, such as a mouse with ACE2 implanted, other laboratory animals, and humanoid animals, indicate the need for efforts to protect against virus 3 in handling the virus, and international cooperation to ensure safe and universally applicable procedures.
SARS and MERS vaccines have been tested in nonhuman animal models.
As of 2020, no cure or vaccine for SARS has been proven safe and effective in humans.
According to research papers published in 2005 and 2006, the discovery and development of new vaccines and drugs for the treatment of SARS was a priority for governments and public health agencies worldwide.
When MERS broke out, it was believed that existing SARS research could provide a useful template for establishing vaccines and treatments for the MERS-CoV virus.
As of March 2020, there has been one MERS vaccine (DNA) that has completed Phase I clinical trials in humans, and three others are under investigation, and all are viral-vector, two adenoviral-vectored (ChAdOx1-MERS, BVRS-GamVac), and one MVA-vector (MVA-MERS-S) vaccines.
Social media posts promote the idea that the virus that causes COVID-19 is known and that a vaccine is already available.
Patents cited in various social media posts refer to existing patents for gene sequencing and vaccines for other coronavirus relatives such as SARS coronavirus.
The b'Coronavirus virus 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious virus caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Common symptoms include fever, coughing, and nausea.
Other symptoms may include fatigue, muscle aches, diarrhea, sore throat, loss of smell, and stomach pain.
The time from exposure to onset of symptoms is usually five days but can range from two to fourteen days.
While most cases result in symptoms of disease, others result in contagious pneumonia and multiple organ death.
As of 17 April 2020, more than 2.24 million cases have been reported in 210 countries and territories, resulting in more than 153,000 deaths.
The virus is spread primarily through contact, usually through tiny droplets that come out when coughing, sneezing, or speaking.
Although these droplets come out when you breathe, they usually fall on the ground or on objects rather than become pathogens over long distances.
People may also become infected by touching infected areas and then touching their eyes, nose, or mouth.
The virus can survive on surfaces for up to 72 hours.
It is most contagious during the first three days after onset of symptoms, although it can spread before the onset of symptoms and in later stages of the virus.
The use of masks is recommended for those who suspect they are infected and their caregivers.
The recommendations for the general public to wear masks vary, with some authorities saying no, others saying no, and still others making it mandatory.
Currently, there is no specific vaccine or treatment for the COVID-19 virus.
Transmissions of the virus have been detected in many countries in all six WHO regions.
Those infected may have no symptoms or have flu-like symptoms such as fever, fever, fatigue, and nausea.
Emergency symptoms include difficulty breathing, persistent chest pain or pressure, confusion, difficulty waking, and green faces and lips; it is recommended to seek immediate medical attention if these symptoms are present.
Rarely, symptoms affecting the upper respiratory tract such as sneezing, wheezing, or sore throat may be seen.
Symptoms in the oral-oral tract such as nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea have been observed in varying percentages.
Other cases in China initially caused only chest tightness and a rapid heartbeat.
In others, the disease can escalate into pneumonia, killing many organs, and even killing.
This is also called the onset of symptoms.
The onset period of COVID-19 disease is usually five to six days but can range from two to 14 days.
97.5 percent of people who develop symptoms develop them within 11.5 days of contracting the disease.
The role of these asymptomatic individuals in transmitting the disease to others is not fully understood; however, current evidence suggests that they may contribute to the spread of the virus.
The number of people infected with the virus who do not show symptoms is currently unknown and is still being studied, and the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) reports that 20% of all infected people have been symptom-free while hospitalized.
China's National Health Commission began including cases of asymptomatic cases in its daily statistics on April 1; of the 166 infected on that day, 130 (78%) were asymptomatic when tested.
Both the cough and the spit can carry the virus.
Speaking out loud produces several drops than normal speech.
A study in Singapore found that coughing without a covering can lead to a cough that goes about 4.5 meters (15 feet).
Although the virus is not normally transmitted through the air, the National Academy of Science suggested that it could be transmitted by sneezing, and air collectors in corridors outside people's rooms produced positive samples of the RNA virus.
Certain medical procedures such as tubal implantation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) can cause the production of particles to be released into the air and result in a sepsis.
Although there is concern that it could be spread through feces, the risk is thought to be minimal. The virus is most contagious when people have symptoms; although transmission may occur before symptoms appear, the risk is minimal.
Although it is not yet fully understood how easily the virus spreads, one person usually infects two or three others, says the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC).
Specifically, it was found that the virus lives for one day on cardboard, for about three days on plastic (polypropylene) and metal (AISI 304), and for about four hours on 99% of dust.
This, however, varies according to humidity and temperature.
Soap can also be effective when used properly; soap products reduce the protective membrane of the bacterium, kill it, and remove it from the skin and other areas.
Some soaps, such as benzalkonium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate (a surgical antibiotic), are not effective.In a Hong Kong study, saliva samples were taken two days after the first hospital admission.
In five of the six patients, the first sample showed a high viral count, and the sixth patient showed a high viral count on the second day of testing.
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a very serious acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, first isolated from three pneumonia patients and linked to a number of severe respiratory illnesses in Wuhan.
All features of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus are derived from coronavirus.
When outside the human body, the virus is killed by household soap, which blasts its protective bubble.SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to SARS-CoV.
The lungs are the most vulnerable organs to COVID-19 because the virus enters the main cells through an enzyme called angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is found in abundance in type II alveolar cells in the lungs.
"The virus uses a special glycoprotein called a ""spike"" (peplomer) to bind to ACE2 and enter the host cell".
The most serious heart damage was found in 12 percent of the infected people hospitalized in Wuhan, China, and it occurs most frequently in critical cases.
High levels of cardiovascular disease symptoms, causing inflammation of the immune system and disease during the course of the disease, but severe heart attacks may also be associated with ACE2 receptors in the heart.
ACE2 receptors are highly expressed in the heart and are involved in cardiac function.
The incidence of thrombosis (31%) and venous thromboembolism (25%) has been detected in ICU patients with COVID-19 and may be related to poor prognosis.Identification of COVID-19 deaths has shown diffuse alveolar damage (DAD), and lymphocytic inflammation in the lungs.
Although SARS-COV-2 has a tropism of ACE2-expressing epithelial cells of the respiratory tract, patients with severe COVID-19 have symptoms of systemic hyperinflammation.
In particular, pathogenic GM-CSF-secreting T-cells have been shown to be associated with the detection of inflamed IL-6-secreting monocytes and the causes of severe lung disease in COVID-19 patients.
Lymphocytic infiltrates have also been reported in autopsies.
WHO has published several protocols for testing the virus.
The usual test is the reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR).
Testing is usually done on breath samples obtained with a nasal swab; however, a nasal swab or a sputum sample may also be used.
Results are usually seen within a few hours to two days.
Blood tests can be used, but this requires two blood samples taken within two weeks and the results are of little value for that time.
Chinese scientists have been able to isolate a portion of the coronavirus and publish the genetic sequence so that laboratories around the world can develop their own polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests to detect the virus for disease.
As of 4 April 2020, genetic testing (which can detect active viruses and whether a person has previously been infected) was introduced, but has not yet been widely used.
The Chinese test results show that accuracy is only 60 to 70 percent.
The FDA in the United States approved the first clinical trial on 21 March 2020 which was used at the end of that month.The diagnostic guidelines issued by the Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University suggested methods for detecting the virus based on the treatment and risk factors for disease control.
Bilateral multilobar ground-glass opacities spread peripherally, asymmetrically and posteriorly are common in infection.
Subpleural dominance, crazy paving (thickening of the lobular septum with variable alveolar filling), and consolidation may occur as the disease progresses.
There is little data available on microscopic lesions and the pathophysiology of COVID-19.
The main causes found in the study were:
Macroscopy: pleurisy, pericarditis, consolidation of the lung and pulmonary edema
Four types of pneumonia virus complications can be identified:
common pneumonia: pulmonary edema, pneumocyte hyperplasia, large atypical pneumocytes, interstitial inflammation with lymphocytic infiltration and multinucleated giant cell formation
severe pneumonia: diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) and diffuse alveolar exudates.
DAD is a cause of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and severe hypoxemia.
curable pneumonia: combination of exudates in the alveolar cavities and pulmonary interstitial fibrosis
Blood: disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC); leukoerythroblastic reaction
Measures to reduce the risk of infection include staying indoors, avoiding crowded places, washing hands frequently with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, practicing oral hygiene and avoiding touching eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands.
The CDC recommends covering the mouth and nose with tissue when coughing or sneezing and recommends using the inside of the elbow when tissue is absent.
Proper hand washing after coughing or sneezing is recommended.
CDC recommends the use of face masks when in public, in part to reduce transmission of the virus from people without symptoms. Social distancing policies are intended to reduce contact between infected people and large groups by closing schools and workplaces, preventing travel and canceling large gatherings.
The rules for distance also include keeping people at least six feet (1.8 m) apart.
"There is no known effective vaccine for COVID-19. With the target not expected until at least 2021, the best way to control COVID-19 is to try to reduce the numbers of those infected, which is called ""flattening the line""".
The CDC also recommends that people wash their hands regularly with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the toilet or when hands appear to be dirty, before eating, and after coughing, coughing, and sneezing.
It also recommends the use of hand sanitizers containing at least 60 percent alcohol, but only if soap and water are not readily available.In areas where hand sanitizers are not readily available, WHO recommends two methods for local production.
In these methods, the antimicrobial activity comes from ethanol or isopropanol.
"Hydrogen peroxide is used to help eliminate bacterial spores in alcohol; ""it is not a disinfectant in hand washing products""."
Glycerol is added to create moisture.
People are treated with care, which may include fluid therapy, oxygenation, and support for other vital organs affected.
The CDC recommends that those suspected of having the virus wear a regular face mask.
Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) has been used to solve the problem of respiratory failure, but its benefits are still being considered.
Cleanliness, a healthy lifestyle, and a healthy diet have been encouraged to prevent infection.
Physical therapy can help those with mild symptoms who have recently been infected.The WHO and the Chinese National Health Commission have published recommendations for hospitalized COVID-19 patients.
U.S. intensivists and pulmonologists have combined treatments from various agencies into a free resource, the IBCC.
As of April 2020, there is no treatment for COVID-19.
When symptoms are seen, some doctors recommend paracetamol (acetaminophen) instead of ibuprofen.
Measures must be taken to reduce the risk of transmission, especially in medical facilities where procedures that may produce aerosols, such as intubation or hand ventilation, are performed.
For doctors caring for people with COVID-19, the CDC recommends keeping a person in the Airborne Infection Isolation Room (AIIR) in addition to using standard measures, preventing contact and sniffing of the virus.The CDC outlines guidelines for the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) during an epidemic.
Necessary items: an PPE jacket, a respirator or face mask, eye protection, and medical gloves. Where available, respirators (instead of face masks) are recommended.
N95 respirators are approved for industrial use but the FDA has approved masks for use under the Emergency Use Authorisation (EUA).
It is designed to protect against airborne particles such as dust but protection from a specific biological agent is not guaranteed in its use.
If masks are not available, the CDC suggests using face shields or, if no other option, artificial masks.
Most cases of COVID-19 are not so severe as to require mechanical ventilation or other procedures, but some do.
A type of respiratory support for COVID-19-related respiratory distress is still being studied in hospital patients, and there is some evidence that intubation can be avoided with high flow nasal cannula or bi-level positive airway pressure.
Whether these two lead to the same benefit for people with serious illnesses is unknown.
Some doctors prefer to stay with invasive mechanical ventilation if available because this method reduces the spread of particulate matter compared to high flow nasal cannula.
Many developing countries lack adequate hospital beds, which reduces the number of people who are untreated and makes it impossible to cope with the sudden increase in the number of people with severe COVID-19 who need to be hospitalized.
One study in China found that 5% were placed in an intensive care unit, 2.3% needed ventilation, and 1.4% died.
In China, about 30 percent of people in hospital with COVID-19 end up in the ICU.
Ventilation systems are becoming more complex as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) develops in COVID-19 and breathing becomes more difficult.
Ventilators with pressure control modes and high PEEP are needed to increase oxygen supply while reducing the risk of ventilator-related lung and pneumothorax damage.
PEEP may not be available in old ventilators.
Clinical trials began in January 2020, and several antiviral drugs are in clinical trials.
Remdesivir seems to be the one that will work.
Although new drugs are still being developed as of 2021, several of the investigational drugs have already been authorized for other uses or have already advanced in trials.
Antibiotics may be tried on people with a severe infection.
The FDA has temporarily approved convalescent plasma as an investigational treatment for conditions where a person is experiencing severe reactions.
It has not undergone the medical research needed to prove its safety and efficacy in treating disease.
In February 2020, a mobile app was launched in China to manage the virus outbreak.
Users are asked to enter their name and ID number.
The app can detect 'intimate contact' using tracking data that could potentially infect.
All users can view the status of three other users.
When a dangerous situation is detected, the app not only encourages social isolation but also warns health authorities.Multiple data analysis with cell phone data, facial recognition technology, cell phone tracking and data-driven surveillance are being used to track infected people and contacts in South Korea, Taiwan, and Singapore.
In March 2020, the Israeli government authorized security agencies to track the cell phone data of people suspected of having coronavirus.
This is done to isolate them from the community and to protect those who may have come into contact with infected residents.
In March 2020, Deutsche Telekom shared location data with the German government agency, the Robert Koch Institute, to investigate and prevent the spread of the virus.
Russia developed facial recognition technology to detect those who violated social distancing laws.
"Italy's state health official Giulio Gallera said he was told by mobile operators that ""40% of the population is still mobile"."
The German government held a 48-hour hack-a-thon over the weekend for 42,000 participants.
The president of Estonia, Kersti Kaljulaid, has announced a national solution to curb the spread of the coronavirus.
People may face the stress of isolation, restrictions on movement, the negative effects of medical treatment, or the fear of infection itself.
"The BBC quoted Rory O'Connor as saying, ""Continued social isolation, loneliness, health concerns, depression, and economic collapse are storms that damage people's minds and well-being"."
The virus may have minor effects with few or no symptoms, similar to other common upper respiratory tract infections such as the common cold.
Common cases have been cured within two weeks, while those with severe or severe infections may take three to six weeks to recover.
Pregnant women may be at greater risk of severe COVID-19 based on data from other similar viruses, such as SARS and MERS, but data for COVID-19 are scarce.
In those who are severely affected, COVID-19 can quickly progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) causing damage to the respiratory tract, septic shock, or multiple organ deaths.
COVID-19-related problems include sepsis, abnormal clotting, and damage to the heart, kidneys, and liver.
Clotting abnormalities, especially increased prothrombin time, were detected in 6% of those hospitalized with COVID-19, while renal dysfunction was seen in 4% of this group.
About 20-30% of people with COVID-19 show high levels of liver enzymes (transaminases).
According to the same report, the average time between the onset of symptoms and death is ten days, five of which are spent in the hospital.
However, patients transferred to the ICU have about seven days between hospitalization and death.
In the early case studies, the average time from the first symptoms of the disease to death was 14 days, a total of six to 41 days.
In a study by the National Health Commission (NHC) in China, the male death rate is 2.8% and the female death rate is 1.7%.
Histopathological examinations of the autopsy lung samples showed diffuse alveolar damage and cellular fibromyxoid exudates in both lungs.
A viral cytopathic mutation was observed in the pneumocytes.
The tube image showed acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
In 11.8% of deaths reported by the National Health Commission in China, cardiac damage was noted in high levels of troponin or cardiac arrest.
According to March data from the United States, 89 percent of those admitted to hospital were already ill. The availability of medical supplies and the economic and social factors of a region can contribute to the death toll.
The death rates from the virus vary because of that regional variation, but also because of the complexity of the methods used.
The rarity of mild cases can cause a higher death rate than expected.
However, the fact that death is the result of previous infections may mean that the death rate is now low.
Smokers are 1.4 times more likely to develop severe symptoms of COVID-19 and about 2.4 times more likely to receive emergency care or die than nonsmokers. Concerns have been raised about long-term pre-virus illnesses.
The Hong Kong Hospital Authority found a 20 to 30 percent decline in lung function in some people who recovered from the virus, and lung masks indicate that it may be damaged.
This can also lead to post-acute care after recovery.
As of March 2020, it was unknown whether the previous virus could provide effective and long-term protection in people recovering from the virus.
Immunity from the virus appears possible, based on other coronaviruses, but cases have been reported where recovery from COVID-19 has been followed by a positive coronavirus test later.
These conditions are thought to be a re-infection rather than a re-infection.
It is thought that the virus is a natural and originally animal, then human.
The exact origin is unknown, but as of December 2019 the spread of the virus was almost entirely driven by human-to-human transmission.
A study of the first 41 confirmed cases of COVID-19, published in January 2020 in the Lancet, showed that the first outbreak date for the disease was 1 December 2019.
Official WHO documents reported that the first signs of the disease appeared on 8 December 2019.
Several methods of counting deaths are widely used.
These numbers vary from region to region and over time and depend on the level of testing, the quality of the medical system, the treatment options, the time since the first outbreak and the population's factors such as age, sex, and health.
In late 2019, WHO assigned ICD-10 emergency virus codes, U07.1 which was killed by laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 virus and U07.2 which was killed by COVID-19 virus identified by medical and analytical analysts without laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 virus.
According to Johns Hopkins University statistics, the global death rate from the virus is 6.9% (153,822/2,240,191) as of 17 April 2020.
Other measures include case fatality rate (CFR), which indicates the percentage of diagnosed deaths from the virus, and infection fatality rate (IFR), which indicates the percentage of infected people (diagnosed and undiagnosed) who die from the virus.
These figures are not based on time and follow the number of individuals from infection to resolution of the incident.
Although not all infected individuals develop disease genes, the presence of disease genes can provide insight into how many people are infected.
In the most infected region of Italy, Castiglione d'Adda, a small community of 4,600, 80 (1.7%) have already died.
In Gangelt, the virus was spread by Carnival gatherings, and it spread to young people, resulting in lower death rates, and not all COVID-19 deaths are officially recognized as infectious.
Moreover, Germany's health system is not yet overcrowded.
In the Netherlands, about 3 percent may have disease components, as blood donors have tested.
69 (0.004% of the population) have been confirmed to have died from COVID-19.
The extent of the epidemic and the death rate vary from man to woman.
The death rate is higher among men in studies conducted in China and Italy.
The greatest risk for men is at age 50, and the gap between men and women closes only by 90.
In China, the death rate was 2.8 percent for men and 1.7 percent for women.
The exact causes of this difference are unknown, but genetic and behavioral factors may be a factor.
The gender-based variation in infection, the lower incidence of frequent smokers among women and the lower incidence of other health conditions such as high blood pressure among men at a younger age than women may contribute to the higher mortality rate among men.
In Europe, 57% of those infected are men and 72% of those who die from COVID-19 were men.
As of April 2020, the US government does not track gender-related data of COVID-19 infections.
Studies show that infectious diseases such as Ebola, HIV, influenza, and SARS affect men and women in different ways.
A high proportion of health workers, especially nurses, are women, and they are more likely to be exposed to the virus.
"The World Health Organization announced on 11 February 2020 that the official name of the virus will be ""COVID-19""".
WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus explained that CO stands for corona, VI stands for virus, D stands for disease, and 19 stands for the year of the first outbreak: 31 December 2019.
The name was chosen so as not to be named after a specific region (such as China), animal species or population group, in line with the suggestions of various countries in the designation aimed at preventing discrimination.The virus that causes COVID-19 is called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
"WHO also uses the terms ""COVID-19 virus"" and ""COVID-19 causing virus"" in public discourse".
"Both the disease and the virus are often referred to as ""coronavirus""".
"During the first outbreak in Wuhan, China, the virus and disease were often referred to as ""coronavirus"" and ""Wuhan coronavirus"."
In January 2020, WHO suggested 2019-nCov and 2019-nCoV acute respiratory disease as terms to be used for virus and disease in accordance with 2015 guidelines against using placeholders in disease and virus names.
The official names COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 were released on 11 February 2020.
Because of a shortage of materials in the manufacturing industry, some digital manufacturers are printing medical devices such as swabs and parts of ventilators.
For example, when an Italian hospital urgently needed a ventilator valve, and the supplier could not deliver it at the time needed, a local company used its own equipment and printed 100 of the required valves in one night.
After the first outbreak of the COVID-19 virus, speculative, false, and misleading news emerged regarding the origin, spread, prevention, treatment, and other aspects of the disease and quickly spread on the Internet.
Humans seem to be able to spread the virus to other animals.
Studies have failed to find evidence of infection of pigs, ducks, and chickens.
There is no authorized drug or vaccine to treat the disease.
International research into COVID-19 vaccines and drugs is being conducted by government agencies, academic groups, and industry researchers.
"In March, the World Health Organization launched a ""Connected Study"" to evaluate the effects of four existing antiviral treatments with high potential for success".
No vaccine is available, but various agencies are working to develop vaccines.
Previous work on SARS-CoV is used because SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 both use the ACE2 receptor to enter human cells.
Three vaccines are being studied.
First, researchers aim to develop a vaccine against the virus.
The purpose of using a virus like this, inactivated or dead, is to establish an immune response against the new COVID-19 virus.
The second method, subunit vaccines, aims to establish a mechanism that causes the immune system to respond to specific aspects of the virus.
In the case of SARS-CoV-2, such research focuses on the S-spike protein that helps the virus enter the ACE2 enzyme receptor.
The third method is nucleic acid targeting (DNA or RNA targeting, a new targeting method).
Vaccines being studied in any of these ways will need to be tested for safety and efficacy.On 16 March 2020, the first clinical trial of the vaccine began with four volunteers in Seattle.
The vaccine contains a harmless genetic code that is copied from the virus that causes the disease.Development based on the disease genes has been suggested as a challenge to the development of the SARS-COV-2 vaccine, but this has not been confirmed.
There are more than 300 clinical trials underway as of April 2020.
Seven studies examined already approved malaria treatments, including four studies with hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine.
Recycled antivirals make up the bulk of the research in China, and nine phase III studies of remdesivir in several countries will submit a report by the end of April.
A robust clinical review of the COVID-19 vaccine and potential therapeutic agents had begun, in April 2020. Several available antiviral drugs are being studied for the treatment of COVID-19, including remdesivir, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir and lopinavir/ritonavir mixed with interferon beta.
There was concrete evidence of remdesivir's effectiveness, in March 2020.
Improvements in patient care have been noted with adequate use of remdesivir.
Phase III clinical trials are underway in the US, China and Italy.Chloroquine, previously used in the treatment of malaria, was tested in China in February 2020, with results that have not yet been authorized.
However, it is proposed that the results of the study be evaluated.
Health authorities in Korea and China are recommending the use of chloroquine.
However, the Wuhan Institute of Virology, although recommending a daily dose of one gram, notes that twice that dose is too high and can be fatal.
On 28 March 2020, the FDA issued emergency use authorization for hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine at the discretion of doctors treating people with COVID-19.
Unapproved data indicate that higher doses of ribavirin are required for in vitro SARS-CoV-2 prevention.
Nitazoxanide has been suggested in ongoing vivo studies after showing weak inhibition of SARS-CoV-2. The study suggests that the initial increase in transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) protein priming is critical for SARS-CoV-2 infection by interaction with ACE2 inhibitor.
Studies of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine with or without azithromycin have significant limitations that have prevented the medical community from receiving these treatments without further research.Oseltamivir does not inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro and has an unknown role in the treatment of COVID-19.
Cytokine storm can be a problem in the later stages of severe COVID-19.
There is evidence that hydroxychloroquine may have anti-cytokine storm properties. Tocilizumab has been added to the treatment guidelines by the National Health Commission of China after a limited study was completed.
A phase 2 nonrandom study was conducted at the national level in Italy after showing positive results in people with severe disease.
Combined with a serum ferritin blood test to detect cytokine storms, it is designed to prevent the occurrence of these, which are thought to be the cause of death in some affected individuals.
The interleukin-6 receptor antagonist was approved by the FDA based on previous research into the treatment of steroid refractory cytokine release syndrome caused by different agents, CAR T cell therapy, in 2017.
To date, there is no random, controlled evidence that tocilizumab is an effective treatment for CRS.
Transmission of purified and potent antibodies produced by COVID-19 patients to people who need them is being investigated as a non-vaccination-less-protection method.
The method was tested in SARS and the results are unknown.
Viral neutralisation is the anticipated method used when treatment with a pathogenic agent may create protection against SARS-CoV-2.
However other mechanisms, such as disease-gen-based cellular cytotoxicity and/or phagocytosis, are possible.
Other gene therapy, for example, using genes from identical cells, is being developed.
The production of convalescent serum, which contains a liquid part of the blood from recovered patients and contains the pathogenic components associated with the virus, can be increased to speed up the process.
Coronavirus diseases, a group of closely related diseases
Li Wenliang, a doctor at Wuhan Central Hospital, who later contracted the virus and died from COVID-19 after helping to raise awareness about the virus' spread.
