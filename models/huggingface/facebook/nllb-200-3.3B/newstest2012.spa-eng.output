Parliament did not support an amendment to release Tymoshenko
The Ukrainian parliament has today rejected a proposal to repeal the amendment of the section of the Criminal Code that condemns opposition leader Yulia Tymoshenko.
The amendment would open the door to the ex-prime minister's release, but MPs rejected the proposal to reduce penalties for economic crimes in the second reading.
In October, Tymoshenko was sentenced to seven years in prison for allegedly signing a deal with Russia disadvantageous to Ukraine on natural gas purchase.
The sentence is not yet final, the appeals court is obliged to review it in December.
Tymoshenko was convinced that this was a political revenge of the regime, and even in the West doubts have arisen about the impartiality of the court.
The proposal to remove paragraph 365 of the Penal Code, which condemned the former prime minister, was supported by 147 MPs in the vote.
The bill needed 226 votes to pass.
The Libyan victory
The story of the Libyan liberation, or the Libyan rebellion, already has its losers.
Muammar el-Gaddafi was buried in a secret place in the desert and without him there is no more war.
The winner is yet to be determined.
As is the custom in the region, the Islamists won the elections, but now it is a question of whether they are moderates or radicals.
The National Transitional Council has brought into force the traditional law, the Sharia, which we are already somewhat familiar with.
Libya will become a country without crime, because thieves will have their hands cut off.
Women can forget about their emancipation and apostates can forget about their execution and so on.
Instead of the person of the dictator, the society, made up of warring tribes, will be united by the Koran.
The order that will be established in Libya is one that we cannot even imagine and certainly cannot.
However, our way of life is neither the only one nor the best, and it probably did not suit the Libyans mentioned above.
It is surprising that the Islamic fighters gratefully accepted the help of the infidel dogs.
The only justification was that, from their point of view, the NATO attacks were not led by an American general, but by Allah, whose greatness they celebrated after each of the successful interventions.
When you look for winners in Libya, the West is not among them.
We are caught in a firefight that the Islamists and our politicians use to get rid of a dictator in the person of a political ally without any guarantees of getting benefits.
After the recent bad experiences in Afghanistan and Iraq, we did not occupy Libya militarily.
In this case, the locals have no problem expelling the "crusaders"
But without the occupation, will the oil companies get hold of Libya's black gold just by saying good words?
Quite possibly not, but it may be that finally the West can boast of protecting human rights.
As long as the followers of Sharia don't cross us.
A new era of crisis is beginning
France and the rest of Europe go on the hunt for the investor scout
A statistical whirlwind has swept across Europe
Individual states have published their GDP data for Q3.
The Czech economy in the interquarterly period has stagnated, while France and Germany have grown.
However, the bond market today has broken records.
Investors are no longer looking only at Italy, but also at Spain, France, Austria and others.
The statistical offices of the Eurozone, Germany, the Czech Republic and other European countries have already published their preliminary estimates of economic growth in the third quarter.
GDP in Germany grew by 0.5% as forecast, GDP in France by 0.4%
In both countries, the second quarter data were published, with Germany showing a more than expected improvement (growth of 0.3% instead of the expected 0.1%), although in France there was a slight reduction of 0.1% (the original data showed stagnation).
The Czech economy grew 1.5% year-on-year in the third quarter of this year.
However, in the inter-quarter period, gross domestic product (GDP) has stagnated and, according to the ČSÚ, the trend of gradual slowing down of economic development is consistent.
The results are even worse than analysts' predictions.
Main events
On a year-on-year basis, the Czech economy grew by 1.5% in the third quarter of this year, but on a quarterly basis it has stagnated.
In the third quarter, the German economy, according to previous data and recalculated seasonally, grew by 0.5%.
The Eurozone economy and the European Union, between July and September and compared to the previous quarter, grew by 0.2%, which is in line with analysts' expectations.
The Greek economy has fallen by 5.2% year on year.
The interest rate on its ten-year bonds is 28.45%.
Interest in Italian and Spanish bonds has grown to critical limits.
The problematic situation is beginning to affect Austria, the Netherlands, France, Belgium, etc.
The interest rates on Czech 10-year bonds are still at 4%, although the situation is worsening in the area.
In Germany there are voices saying that the ECB should be the lender of last resort.
The Czechs are qualified for the European Cup.
They won 1-0 and celebrate qualifying with a $200 million bonus.
The football team takes on the toughest task of the entire season!
In Montenegro, thanks to the excellent Čech and the brilliant goalkeeper Petr Jiráček, the win was 1: 0.
The Czech team, along with a good dose of luck in the second half, defended themselves fantastically from the attacks of the local team, so that they will not miss the appointment of the European championship.
IHNED.cz followed the development of the party in detail in a thorough report.
There was almost no excitement in the first half and a good dose of luck in the second.
The Czech team, thanks to the collapse of the local team towards the final, and also to the excellent game of Čech and the heroic Jiráček, won by 1:0 in Montenegro and celebrates its pass to the European Championship.
Because of the correct Czech defense, the Montenegrins didn't press until the second half.
The two losers of the match were Damjanovič and Vučinič, who missed two big occasions.
In addition, thanks to the great Petr Čech, the Czech national team will not miss the European Cup, so that the national football coffers will receive a bonus of approximately 200 million crowns.
From the first minutes, there was a good offensive game.
Both teams were only concerned with keeping the lines and playing nothing else around the center of the field.
There was no pressure from the home team in the first half, kicking the other side in defence, which is exactly what the Czech defence was able to avoid.
Iranian students are willing to die for their country's nuclear program.
They formed a human shield.
Several hundred university students formed human shields around nuclear facilities in Iran.
With their gesture they want to express their support for their country's nuclear program in the face of a possible Israeli attack.
Students prayed at noon Tuesday in front of the facility and then chanted death slogans to the US and Israel.
Several hundred university students formed human shields around the nuclear technology center that works with uranium in the Iranian city of Isfahan on Tuesday.
They want to show that they are willing to defend their country's nuclear program with their own lives.
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has recently concluded in a report that Iran is, by all indications, striving to obtain nuclear weapons.
Israel is talking about a possible attack on Iranian nuclear facilities.
Students prayed at noon in front of the nuclear facility in Isfahan and then launched death slogans against the US and Israel.
In the event of an attack, the aim of which would be to paralyse Iran's nuclear programme, it would, according to Israeli sources, hit not only the Isfahan plant but also the Natanz facilities, where uranium is enriched.
Daily menu of an obese child: no breakfast and dinner with sausages
More than one third of children aged 9 to 13 are overweight, with overweight affecting 9% of the school population and obesity affecting 5%.
Obese children are mostly from families with unhealthy lifestyles, according to current research.
The importance of the environment in which one grows up for the healthy development of the person is again demonstrated, as well as the models that serve as a reference.
At the table, obese children eat, for example, at least twice as often as children from normal-weight families.
For dinner, more than 19 percent of the obese had eaten fries the day before the test, which is linked to the "Obesity Is Not a Chance" prevention program.
In families of overweight children there is no habit of practicing sports, which is applicable to most of the current families, where only 15% of children answered that their parents, at least once a week, find time for physical exercise.
Survey of 900 children
The survey was carried out at the end of the last school year and involved almost 900 children from all over the Czech Republic.
It was the second edition of the "Obesity is not a coincidence" program, which is supported by the General Health Insurance Company and the Unilever company.
So far, more than 12,000 children from the 4th to the 8th grade have participated in the project.
Proper diet and sufficient exercise in the family are determining factors, which cause a marked decrease in the number of overweight and even obese children.
"Only half of the children surveyed said they had five meals a day according to the regimen: breakfast, lunch, dinner, snack and dinner, which is one of the basic conditions for a healthy diet", says one of the survey results.
No breakfast but with stew for dinner
Specialists warn that in healthy development, details are important, such as having a fixed time for breakfast in the family.
In the Czech Republic, however, only 23% of schoolchildren's families eat breakfast at the same time.
In most families, everyone eats breakfast alone.
But the worst part was finding out that 10% of the households don't eat breakfast at all.
Breakfast, however, is the basis of a proper daily diet.
The study shows that the families of obese children consume the unhealthy French fries much more often.
Almost everyone - regardless of weight - drinks sugary soft drinks daily (70%).
Overall, more than 40% of the children surveyed do sports, however, among their parents this result is reduced to less than half, only 15%.
Make your own diet
The next phase of the study allowed the selected children (204 boys and 172 girls from 13 schools) to create their own diets from all possible offers according to their tastes and opinions.
"Food preferences of Czech children aged 12 to 15 are, from the point of view of healthy eating, far from ideal".
Among his favorite foods are pasta, meat and sweets
"The popularity of soft drinks is particularly alarming", warns the study's final report.
The main meal is palm paste, closely followed by bird meat.
Practically, children always reject legumes and the taste for fish and vegetables is very low.
Changing to Healthy Habits
At the same time, the study shows that children are willing to change their eating habits if they are given the right information.
"In the control group of study participants who completed the questionnaire after the end of the prevention programme 'Obesity is not a coincidence', there was in many cases a significant shift in favour of the principles of healthy eating", the study results state.
For example, the issue of soft drinks is noteworthy, as many children would prefer plain water.
Children would also more often choose poultry and fish for their main meal and restrict their consumption of sweet food and flour derivatives.
The stylist must also be a good psychologist, say the professionals
In the introductory article, How Stylists Learn, I already complained a bit that the initial lessons were already quite loaded.
I had no idea how that was gonna go.
Lectures by three professionals in the business, how to dress problem characters and, in addition, a seminar on how it works in the entertainment world.
And it will get worse.
The closer the final exams are, the more information and practical assignments await us.
And although the course is held every Saturday and Sunday, there's no room for a pin anymore.
We've been studying with the head teacher, Alena, (there are no men in the course) on how to dress the woman who doesn't have perfect symmetry.
And so is the vast majority.
Some are short-necked, some have a stylized figure without the proper curves, and some are overweight.
The stylist must be able to smooth out broad shoulders, lengthen a neck, or recreate the necessary curves
We've been given some tricks on how to make the body of a Jennifer Lopez type of woman stand out, with huge breasts and hips but a tight waist, and at the same time not dress her in too much of a provocative way.
If, for example, the difference between your waist and your hips is so great that your skirt or pants don't fit, it's worth having at least one extra piece of fabric tailored to your size.
They'll certainly not regret it, because clothes that fit perfectly are priceless.
A custom skirt will feel much better than one that keeps moving, standing up, dancing on the waist, etc.
The stylized body may be allowed to wear folded, ornamented, embroidered or draped clothing.
There are certainly many different kinds of information and bodies, so I'm glad I have all week to put all this information in order in my head.
And even so, I'm afraid with the assignment, I've already got more than enough.
Each participant in the course has been assigned two celebrities, who will have to design two costumes: one for the day and one for the night.
The current look, the fashion style that suits the person in question, must be taken into account.
I got to dress Miranda Kerr, you might know her from the Victoria's Secret campaign.
I'm a screamer, for me, much better than, say, Britney Spears or Christina Aguilera, who has recently gained about a hundred kilos (please note the exaggeration), or the very young Selena Gomez.
We have to cut out dresses from magazines or search the Internet and print them, and then we have to draw them out graphically.
The moodboard, which is what the whole result is called, also expresses our personal style and our relationship with graphic design.
It's also important to think about the graphic part of stylism.
The stylist, therefore, not only dresses physically, but also deals, for example, with the product pages in magazines (of specific topics, such as trends, bags, coats, etc.).
All this was discussed by stylist and designer Mario Kameník.
But this is all for Sunday.
The stylist has to have a global vision.
The three expert guests brought the Saturday lecture to life with information on all kinds of bodies.
The stylist Honza Pokorný, the fashion designer Jakub Polanka and the fashion photographer Ben Renč.
Jakub reminded us that fashion is an illusion and the stylist should know how to take advantage of this.
And a good stylist knows how to work with the same garment in different ways.
Variability is, in this case, fundamental.
Thus, the trench coat can be dressed classically with jeans and a T-shirt, but it also serves to dress the naked body with heels and photograph it as if it were actually a dress.
Or you can just roll it up and raise your neck to get a totally different image.
"Play with it", he insisted.
The advice I value most is this: "To get started, you need to know all the rules first".
"Then you can break them", said Jakub.
I finally understand why we memorize all these formulas, what is combined with what, why, if it turns out later in fashion magazines we find different results.
Not to mention the fashion shows.
Thanks to photographer Ben, I know a stylist has to have more types of clothes in stock than he's meant to photograph.
So, for a fashion story to have ten pages (hence, ten outfits), you have to have at least fifteen ready-to-wear outfits.
And also that the photos the clothes work in combination with other garments, all of them different from the ones that are worn in reality.
All of this must be taken into account when designing the outfit.
Honza Pokorný assured us that image and style alone, in many cases, represent half of the success.
Just look at Madonna, who is not exactly a great singer, but the image and the marketing have made her a world star.
In the Czech Republic, there is no clear trend towards using stylists' services at the moment.
Even famous characters also find it useless (my skills are enough, my physical appearance is not so important).
And when someone asks for our services, we must bear in mind that it is very likely that they will indicate a size very different from their actual (smaller) size.
Then you just Google it and find out if the heart magazines have already written about the topic, if a certain celebrity has gained weight, etc.
On Sunday, Honza and Mario insisted that stylists should not just focus on fashion, but also understand the concept of outfit.
During your work, you must above all communicate with the people you are wearing, so it is essential to be a good psychologist.
He values people, he doesn't look down on them, he defends their opinions.
"When a director hires you to sort out her wardrobe and fill it with beautiful clothes, you can't just take it all and throw it away and say, 'Oh, what a horror.'"
"Find at least a couple of things that you can think about and recommend for someone to wear", Mario says.
He also showed us that everything must fit in the so-called "placovka", that is, the work bag.
This one is fixed around the waist and you have all the necessary tools there.
There are also nylon threads (which serve the stylist during the photo session of products such as bags or hats), special clothing grippers for the front, if this was larger (pins and other types of grip are not allowed, as they could damage the fabric), or a sewing set.
To avoid being passive listeners and to put something into practice, we have learned to put on the soles of our shoes.
Even during studio photo shoots, on a flat surface, the sole could be damaged and much more so the exterior.
And all we did was coat and coat.
We couldn't touch the shoes with the scissors so we wouldn't damage them by accident.
So you had to be very clever.
Mario has given me a joy by praising my work without reservation.
I'm not really good at those things.
This is just a small part of all that we have heard during the whole weekend, in the second part of the course.
I've come to realize that pursuing styling professionally is not a rosy path, but I don't care what people say.
In Need for Speed: The Run, he competes across America.
Summary
A seemingly carefree trip is complicated by a series of carelessness unsuited to a routine morning shift.
The Commission has already made a number of proposals to the Council, and I am sure that the Council will be able to accept them.
The new installment, to which The Run is added, aroused great expectations even before its premiere.
It promised to give a new air to the old racing saga Need for Speed and, as a result of what was shown, it appears as a game that should not end up being again a genre of action without more.
We were also curious to see what the inserted scenes would look like, where the main character gets out of the car and walks on his own feet.
As is often the case with NFS series, the results do not vary much from what we expected.
There are races that can be considered acceptable, but in the total count points are lost due to absurd errors, which have already been appearing in the series for years.
In reality, we cannot call them errors, but rather the incomprehensible reluctance of programmers.
The adventure starts very well.
You are introduced to a story, whose protagonist, Jack, has certain personal problems; to solve them, he is offered to participate in an illegal race across America.
You're driving on the West Coast, in San Francisco, and your mission is to get to New York first.
The idea is to offer something interesting.
The route is divided into ten stages and then into more than fifty races.
It follows that each race takes place on a different route and the stages are located in different environments, which are quite diverse and interesting.
Thus, you do not even remotely get the feeling that the game is always offering the same thing.
Some of the environments are even pleasing to the eye, although the technical level of the graphic is equivalent to that of previous installments of the series.
So it's not out of this world.
But a walk in the desert, the autumn landscape or the high snow-capped mountains produce a very pleasant visual effect.
Furthermore, careers are sometimes diversified by an atypical element.
So, for example, in the desert you encounter a sandstorm that reduces visibility.
But in the mountains, you have to be careful not to be buried by an avalanche.
According to that, each of the races is very well developed.
There's only a couple of models, but that's enough.
For a moment, you try to overtake a required number of rivals (the norm in a classic race), then you try to gain time (classic timed duel) and then a duel against a single opponent awaits you.
In the midst of all this, the police sometimes appear, which only makes things more difficult.
The new thing is the landscapes outside the car.
Interactive animations are presented when Jack, in most cases, has to escape from someone and you have to help him, always pressing the right button at the right time.
Nothing complicated
It is surprising, however, that there are far fewer landscapes in the game than might be expected (there are actually only three).
But the end result is positive, because this element does not become annoying and, in the context already mentioned, it is one of the elements that make the game more interesting.
The driving pattern follows the trail of the previous episodes.
That means that today it is no longer a big deal, but it cannot be said to be bad.
If you're looking for a realistic simulation, you can look elsewhere.
But a race designed with a lot of action is well suited to this style of driving, although we may find something better among the competing games.
So far, all is well.
But problems arise after a certain time.
Unlike the correct driving models, the same is no longer true with collisions.
Games of this kind cannot be expected to recreate complicated deformations and collisions, but in fact before a hit against any object, you can not predict how your car will react, so not everything is in order.
Typically, when you're overtaking a tight overtaking or driving in normal traffic, there are only slight bumps, but in other almost identical situations, your car ends up doing uncontrolled pirouettes.
Or even completely destroyed.
Thanks to the reset system, no major problems arise, but it can put you in a bad mood.
The resets are programmed in such a way that when you have an accident or go off the track, the game returns you to the last rescue point on the track.
However, in each race there are only five resets available.
If you consume all of them, you have to restart the race from the beginning.
So it's just a little help in case something goes wrong, but it's not very reliable.
Sometimes it doesn't even help to reset, it just helps to learn the given stage by heart.
A big disadvantage of the game is that the same events repeat themselves in different places.
Some curves, for example, have to be entered in a specific way; otherwise, they are impossible to take.
Other times you find yourself in a place where "civilian" vehicles are always in the same configuration, even if you are the first, fifth or arrive five minutes earlier or later.
This is especially irritating in situations where you see two cars coming into the intersection in opposite directions, your opponent is easily ahead, but when you get there, you must turn or brake.
It doesn't matter when you arrive, because it's programmed so that the "surprise" will always happen right under your nose.
The adversaries have one more advantage.
Throughout the game you will come to places where, regardless of the moment, the same opponent will always overtake you in the same place.
And this happens at the end of the game, on a long bridge, which is even more shocking.
Your opponent must get there before you, no matter the cost.
When it's in front of you, it makes it difficult to see the cars coming in front of you, so at first you can make a mess of the car.
You can understand the idea of creating a game with maximum doses of suspense and adrenaline, but the execution is so apparent that you are likely to be disappointed right away.
And it's a shame, because even though the travel model is simple, the game is fun and action packed, so it's often not possible to follow in detail what's happening or where.
And it really doesn't matter, whether the credit goes to the idea with fifty exclusive tracks or the qualifying in the race to keep boredom out, or whatever.
An unusual idea is to change cars during races.
You have to be careful at the gas pumps on the side of the road, because that's where you have to change cars, although in the vast majority of cases you will be satisfied with what you have.
Cars fall into three categories.
Sports cars are suitable for urban areas, American muscle cars for straight highways and exotic super sports cars for technical driving, for example, on curvy mountain roads.
In addition to the main narrative thread, there is also a parallel thread of challenges, that is, there are races in specific places that you will know from the stories.
Here you'll get not only medals, but also experience points for your profile, which is good for both challenges and stories.
At the top level, the driver is presented with several options, starting with the car and ending with the background for the profile.
At the same time, an Autolog online feature is connected, which compares your results with those of other players and makes other community features available.
One of the hardest elements to understand is how the last race in history is made.
You drive to the subway tunnel (pass), where you run around the tracks in the dark (pass).
The speedometer puts you between 90 and 120 miles per hour, and then suddenly the subway car arrives behind you and just takes you away.
In the newsroom we will surely have a discussion about this for several days, about whether during the programming of the game no one thought even a little or whether the authors really take us for a bunch of fools.
The technical part of the game is nothing extraordinary, but at least the overall visual effects result in most cases pleasant, sometimes even superb.
It is a pity that in the most tense moments the quality of the image is reduced, and sometimes seriously.
This is particularly true of accidents involving many participants, when the continuous image quality is no longer valid.
The audio is fine and the soundtrack is a matter of taste.
To please the majority of the youth group, the soundtrack falls into the "every man for his father and mother" category, but it can be assumed that no one would buy the game for its music alone.
The final feel of Need for Speed: The Run is therefore quite confusing.
If the game avoided absolutely stupid mistakes, we would have trouble claiming that The Run is the best NFS game of recent years.
It gives the feeling that the game is not over.
The fun is assured, but prepare for mistakes to hit you in the eye with the force of airport searchlights.

Ambassador to the EU, Vicenová:
The Czechs have a reputation as negative and Eurosceptic.
'The Lisbon Treaty has significantly affected the balance between the individual institutions'
"I didn't expect to see a war without a quarter".
"It will take five or six years before the situation stabilizes a bit, calms down and the new players get used to their new roles", began with conviction the lecture at the Faculty of Law by the Czech ambassador to the EU, Milena Vicenová.
How can we not take seriously his slogan "clarely and openly about Europe", which he said in the first part of his lecture, when he managed to describe each EU body and its relations with such precision and clarity, as it would be the envy of many lecturers at the Faculty of Law of the University of Carolina.
Vicenová also weighed in on the work of the new permanent President of the European Council, Herman van Rompuy:
"The first thing that comes up is that he is a dull, grey official, capable of assuming any role, but I have to say that he left everyone baffled, because he assumes his roles perfectly".
"He is a man who knows how to listen to the members of the 27 states, communicate with them and has a very clear vision of where the EU should go".
The new post of representative of the Foreign and Security Policy is explained by the question: 'Who is this EU? What number can I call?'
Nobody wants to ban us from Olomouc cheese
Vicenová has also dealt with the agenda followed, is following and will follow the European Council in the near future.
The Czech presidency two years ago was a success.
The Czechs dealt with the emerging economic crisis, solved the gas crisis and organized a summit for the Eastern Partnership.
The fall of the government at that time was identified as a very negative aspect, which seriously affected the Czech Republic.
The Czech representation in the EU has many commitments at the moment.
In the words of the ambassador, "a good turmoil", not only the presidency, but also the financial crisis, which is being dealt with now.
On the other hand, the EU's budget for seven years must be approved, which is caused by the current economic situation, which is much more complicated.
If the budget is simpler and more effective, which sectors will be given priority, which countries will receive more support and which less?
The Commission is also proposing to extend the scope of the programme to include the following areas:
"The truth is, I don't like ugly abbreviations, foreign words or jargon that people don't understand".
How can a citizen understand that in Brussels cucumbers are not really invented, or curved or round cucumbers, bananas of various sizes or that no one is going to ban Olomouc cheese?
It also aims to make more use of the EU environment and bring more Czech citizens closer to the European institutions.
Europe of speed is upon us
According to the ambassador, the Czechs have a reputation for being Eurosceptics and people perceive the negatives more than the positives.
The European Union should also be able to play a more active role in the fight against terrorism.
The fault lies in a multitude of factors, such as the modesty of our candidates, their inability to write motivational messages, but also the lack of support from the Czechs.
In addition to the success of the Czech presidency, it highlighted the strength and collaboration of the Visegrad Group.
"Believe me, when a Pole and a Hungarian come to me and a Slovak approaches me, a Frenchman next to me says to me: 'What, you Visegrad Group members are here already?' and it is clear that he does not like it".
The EU's future, according to Vicenová, is to be a new, very tough set of rules on budgetary policy for the Member States.
It is perceived as something very real of the concept of two speeds, if not more, in Europe, more than the new "European Federation".
"We have countries in the Eurozone and countries outside the Eurozone".
"We have the Schengen area and we also have the enhanced cooperation procedure".
"It was said for the first time that only the countries that want to cooperate and those that do not, that they stay out".
"These procedures will be more and more numerous and will strengthen the two-speed Europe", she hopes.
In this respect, he also highlighted the role of the Czech Republic and Herman van Rompuy in implementing the principle that all issues affecting the whole of the EU should be discussed among the Member States, not just among the members of the euro area.
Brand story:
The innovative IBM begins its second century of existence
If anyone were to look for a term that would define IBM's strategy very precisely, the most approximate one would be "long-term".
For the general public, IBM is the symbol of a technological revolution, a company that is perceived as current and yet has already passed a hundred years since its foundation.
The foundation of this long-term character was laid by the firm's first chief, the visionary Thomas J. Watson Sr.
He already coined the motto that many of the world's problems have a solution if people are willing to think.
His motto "Think!" became his hallmark, around which the future giant's life was built (it was also the title of an internal magazine that IBM began publishing in 1935).
Watson was also the foundation of a carefully constructed company culture.
"For us, IBM implies a long-term thinking, a continuous movement towards the future.
IBM has survived and thrived for a hundred years for that reason, because it stayed true to its core principles, but not afraid of the changes around it.
That has enabled us, in our first century, to transform technology, business and society.
We hope to prosper even more in our second century", said current company director Samuel J. Palmisano during its anniversary.
A Sophisticated System
Watson, already in the 1930s, was concerned about the care of his employees like the businessman from Baťa in the Czech Republic (IBM employees were among the first American operators to enjoy paid vacations, insurance, elegant uniforms and a sophisticated remuneration system that rewarded the best inventors and salesmen.
The same long-term sophistication IBM maintains in its relationship with the customer.
From the very beginning, the company was able to identify talents (being one of the first companies in the world to eliminate any kind of discrimination, it could choose without problems).
In line with the anti-discrimination strategy, IBM's current plan is that Palmisano will be replaced next year by a woman: Virginia Rometty.
She has been working for thirty years at IBM, where she has been head of sales, marketing and strategies.
Over the past few years, IBM has been participating in what are called "virtual meetings", online brainstorming events, from which a myriad of future strategies and innovations have emerged.
Not surprisingly, ideas abound, for the firm employs nearly half a million people.
An institution with a good reputation
The fixed position in the business gives the company a strong internal and external image.
"From the beginning, IBM has been more of an institution than a technology company", says economist Rosabeth Moss Kanter, a professor at Harvard Business School and author of the book IBM.
"IBM is not a technology company, but a company that tries to solve business problems for technology users", points out George Colony of the consultancy Forrester Research.
As the company itself says there is a difference between going into business and directly creating a business.
IBM - or "Big Green" - as it is known in the U.S. colloquially because of its logo, has become in the last hundred years one of the largest companies in the world.
It is possibly the most versatile technology company (develops both hardware and software, infrastructure and web hosting services within a wide range of services, ranging from servers to nanotechnology).
It holds the most patents of any US technology company and five of its employees have received Nobel Prizes.
His inventions included the ATM machine, payment cards, financial swaps, bar codes, and floppy disks.
IBM will make a profit of $220 billion this year, and this year it has become the second largest technology firm by market capitalisation (the first is Apple), when it overtook Microsoft for the first time in 1996.
Looking to the future
Not all products and innovations have just satisfied the taste of customers and the moment (IBM did not bet on its own operating system, OS/2, Prodigy online services or IBM PCjr computers).
"If your business is based on moving forward, you cannot anchor emotionally in the past", Samuel J. Palmisano acknowledged.
IBM has no problem building its foundations on other platforms (and equally, if they don't work, it abandons them).
And that's the difference from the competition, Microsoft, which basically stands and falls exclusively with Windows.
Technology of the future
In terms of sales, IBM is mainly involved in services, of which about one fifth is software and another fifth is hardware.
However, even in 1990 equipment accounted for more than half of the suppliers' quota.
Since 2000, IBM has sold off underperforming assets worth a total of $15 billion, while in the same period, it has invested $58 billion in the purchase of future technology.
Investments have continued since 2008, when the modern global financial crisis first manifested itself.
IBM is acting on the premises of its first boss, Thomas J. Watson, who during the great economic crisis of '29 increased investments.
It seems that IBM has so far managed to survive the crisis.
The value of IBM's stock since the beginning of 2008 has risen stratospherically by 120%, the company's net profit has continued to rise.
IBM's currency is changing everything but its value.
So it can be expected that when the next crisis comes, this flexible giant will hold out.
IBM history: from the cheese slicer to spaceflight
IBM (International Business Machines) was founded in New York City a hundred years ago, originally called the Computing Tabulating Recording Corporation.
The name IBM was adopted as early as 1924 - originally it was a trademark used in the branches of Canada and South America.
The foundation that gave rise to the birth of IBM arose from the merger of four companies that date back to the 1880s.
He had such inventions as the famous "check clock", which allowed him to control the entrance and exit of employees.
The architect of the new company was businessman Charles Ranlett Flint, who until 1930 also chaired its supervisory board.
Flint hired the head of a competing firm, Thomas J. Watson, to help him run the company.
The new leader overshadowed the founder of IBM (Watson's ideas remain the firm foundation on which the corporate culture and identity are sustained).
Watson ran the company until 1952.
IBM, as its name suggests, began with the production and sale of all kinds of business appliances, from meat and cheese cutters to cash registers.
During the first four years Watson ran the company, turnover doubled to $9 million and the company's great expansion across the continents began.
Watson was so crucial to the company that, after nearly forty years in the chair, he was replaced by his son, Thomas Watson Jr.
Under his leadership, IBM began working on the development of artificial intelligence and developed the first programming language.
In the 1960s, IBM personnel and computers helped NASA guide space flights (to Mercury, Saturn, and in 1969 the famous flight to the Moon).
Meanwhile, in 1964 IBM developed the first generation of computers, the IBM System/360 series.
The classic "fish", which set the standard for computers at the time, came to market as the IBM 5150 in 1981.
Twenty years later, IBM sold its computer production to the Chinese company Lenovo, which in turn acquired the consulting part of the company Pricewaterhouse Coopers and began offering complete consultancy and high value-added services.
The strategy that IBM has paid for over the last three years is the Smarter Planet concept, that is, "a smarter planet".
It aims to make a more rational use of technology, although areas have not yet been planned or circumstances have not yet been improved, for example, in transport and city management.
For the retail sector, IBM recently introduced the 'Smart Commerce' platform which enables retailers to manage the entire sales cycle.
IBM has a long history in this country.
Already in 1932 he opened a branch in what was then Czechoslovakia, the first country to have one in Central and Eastern Europe.
Today, IBM ČR also operates the strategic outsourcing centre in Brno.
The headquarters for Central and Eastern Europe is in Prague, and there's a world-renowned research team here that's working on voice recognition.
Rychtářová about her unfaithful husband:
Iveta, stay with that donkey, I don't want him anymore!
Darina Rychtářová (53) said it was over!
After her husband Josef Rychtář (53) had become the sole protector of Iveta Bartošová (45), but also her lover, Darina still had hope that Josef would wake up from his pink dream and return home.
However, it will no longer wait and has set clear rules for life in the future.
"Pepe can come home, but not as my partner anymore", explained Rychtářová.
When Darina Rychtářová took Bartošové to her home for the summer, she could not imagine how her marriage would end.
Despite the request, Iveta had not moved thirty days after Říčany and Pepe did not abandon the singer.
He even publicly declared that he loved her.
In time, Darina resigned herself, apparently accepting her husband's relationship and even saying good-bye to him for good.
Rychytář doesn't care who his wife sleeps with.
If one day Rychtář broke up with Bartošová, his wife would not be waiting for him at home with open arms.
He's the biological father of my children, and if he wants to live out the rest of his life in our home, no one will throw him out".
"But here I would live no longer as my dear old fool who made a mistake, but as a man to whom I have certain ties", Rychtářová said, adding that she had already gotten rid of her husband and insisted only on mutual respect.
Josef doesn't care that his wife locked the back door.
"I accept my wife's decision".
"I'll be with Iveta and there's no change possible".
"My wife established this as a marriage on paper and I respect that".
"The business is still going, I do the housework, I take care of the garden, the home, I do the shopping".
"Darina and I talk normally, only we don't share a bed", Rychtář said.
If Rychtářová found a new love, he wouldn't object.
"We don't sleep together and I don't care about her, where she goes or if she has a boyfriend.
I know it's my fault, I fell in love with Iveta and I take all the responsibility", Josef concludes.
Women's worst vices: Do they apply to you too?
If you ask men to be able to name some typical vices of women, in general each of them will name them without thinking.
Dear women, do you recognize them in the following lines, where certain female vices are mentioned that manage to boil the blood of men?
Going shopping
You blame your orange half for being a shopping addict?
Does he have to buy at least one trapito a week?
Do you like to shop at the auction often?
Then in your case you can say that shopping has become a vice.
Some women realize that they should temper their passion for shopping, at least a little.
But what woman could resist the temptation to just wander through clothing stores, pick out clothes that fit well, and then try them all on in the fitting room (ideally in all different colors)?
While shopping is a pastime for most women, it can become practically hell for men.
Just remember how many times you've told your partner to wait for you outside the door.
The Constant Discontent
"Am I not too fat?"
"I need to lose at least ten pounds - should I start exercising?"
"Do you really like me?"
Do these phrases ring a bell?
That you do?
So you're one of those women who's obsessed with her looks.
Not that you should neglect your body, but many men are allergic to hearing their mate complain about her physical appearance all the time.
The stronger sex also agrees that the more the frequency of complaints increases, the more annoying women become.
Order and Cleanliness First
It's like an infinite loop.
Clean the windows, vacuum, scrub the floor, dust off, scrub the tub and all that at least twice a week.
Do you blame your spouse for treading on a clean floor with a dirty foot, your children for dirtying a freshly cleaned sink, and a shelf with glass doors that you have worked so hard to clean?
If you suffer from this "deviation", try to be aware that nothing should be overblown and that order and cleanliness certainly should not be paramount in the family.
This harmless desire for cleanliness could threaten their relationships and family welfare.
Making unpleasant comments
"Used underpants are left with dirty clothes".
"You want to wear those used socks tomorrow, too?"
"Wet cloth is not left on the floor!"
If you do that to your partner more than once a day, you'll get him out of his head.
You don't mean anything bad, you just want to get everything in order.
Perhaps if men knew this, women, for their part, would not make so many comments.
Slander and gossip
Some women are also good at slander, gossip, but also offending and conspiring against someone.
Women focus on relationships, so they like to talk together about things like who, where, with whom, how and why.
Maybe each of us occasionally misses a little harmless gossip.
With the hand on the heart, this is typical of almost all women.
On the other hand, there are gossipy women who are not in control, who love to gossip and do it often, they despise everyone and are dangerous to those around them, especially in a female work team.
Jagr and Voráček helped their assists to beat Philadelphia .
Hockey forward Jaromír Jágr was on hand Monday with two assists that brought the Philadelphia team to victory, 5-3, at Carolina's home court and put Czech players back in the forefront of the competition.
In both cases Claude Giroux took advantage of the 39-year-old star's play, and took another step and was declared the best player of the match.
He was awarded two assists in the game and also Jágr's teammate, Jakub Voráček.
After the meeting, Jágr told the overseas journalists that Giroux had predicted a great night.
"I told him before the game that he'd make a triple".
"I was presenting it".
"Sometimes they look like ambushes", Jágr explained, after his performance gave a goal to Giroux, following the first flyer's trallazo.
A little later, the team's second intervention also had a Czech trace.
Voráček got the puck behind the Hurricanes goal and moved it between the circles until Maxim Talbot scored.
A second before the first break a local player, Patrick Dwyer, was ejected, but from the beginning of the second half the Flyers were already dominating.
Specifically for Giroux.
After collaborating with Jágr he scored the third goal, after his shot slipped through the fourth of Wayne Simmonds's goal.
"I love playing with him".
"I don't want to say he's the best player on the court, but he's definitely in the top three", Jágr said to his center.
"I never thought that at the end of my career I would play with a sportsman like him".
"I'm very satisfied with it".
"I want to play for him".
All these years in the NHL, my teammates played for me, and that now produces results", Jagr adds.
Carolina still turned the game into a drama, with the goal of Tuom Ruutu and then again Dwyer, from penalty, until they got a goal away.
Matt Read did not allow any more complications, although they were eventually outnumbered two to one.
"Pronger had a good run on our court".
"He dropped the puck, I picked up speed, and Read went to the farthest part".
"I tried to hit the puck and I'm glad I did", Voráček described the last goal of the match as he experienced it.
With their win, Philadelphia has moved to the top of the Eastern Conference.
Montreal's Czech defender Jaroslav Špaček did not play until the end of the game against Buffalo, in the second third he retired due to an injury in the upper part of the body.
The Canadiens not only lost a player with a lot of defensive experience, but also by a two-goal difference, 2:3.
Tomáš Plekanec did not know how to take advantage of one of the shots.
More than the points lost to the local coach lamented the large number of injured in the last row, and play the game only with five defenders.
"That is bad".
"We played the game with only one veteran player, the rest were novices".
"Well, there's nothing to be done about it, we have to deal with it", said Martin Jacques.
"So much rotating the players turned against us, we couldn't resist it".
"We had to simplify the game even more, take the puck out of our field".
"And so we leave gaps", explained one of the defenders, P. K. Subban.
Goalkeeper Ondřej Pavelec contributed thirty interceptions from Winnipeg in the 5-2 win over Tampa Bay.
The Jets' goals were scored by five players who ended a series of defeats that had already lasted five games.
How have travel prices evolved since 1989?
Until 1989 there were only five authorised state travel agencies in the then Czechoslovakia: Čedok, Sporturist, CKM, Rekrea and Autoturist.
Travel agencies at the time mostly sold trips only to the socialist bloc, as travel to the West was very restricted.
Czech tourists therefore went on holiday to the beaches of the GDR (German Democratic Republic), the Soviet Union (Sochi in Crimea on the Black Sea), Bulgaria and Romania (both on the Black Sea) and Hungary (Balaton).
A positive exception was the period between 1962 and 1972, when you could travel to Yugoslavia, however, after the Yugoslav regime inclined west and travel of Czech tourists were then quite restricted.
A great paradox of socialism was the fact that citizens of the socialist bloc (i.e. also Czechoslovaks) were not allowed to travel freely and individually even in socialist countries.
If a citizen wanted to travel individually, for example to Poland or the Soviet Union, he needed an invitation letter, otherwise the individual journey was not possible.
Travel agencies offered trips to the West in those days, but you had to stand in line with a sleeping bag and spend the night, or have "good acquaintances" at the agency.
Still not all was won.
The so-called "promise of change" that was the condition for the trips to the West, was not granted to the "politically unreliable people", who could not travel at all.
The Czechoslovak currency was not a freely convertible currency and, without a guarantee of exchange, it was not possible to obtain the resources (the Western currency) to travel to the West.
The vast majority of Czechs spent their holidays in their own country, so there were a large number of cottages and summer houses, which Czechs would acquire.
The way Czechs travel has undergone a real revolution since 1989.
While until 1989 we were no longer going to spend our holidays in the GDR or Bulgaria, last year the Czechs made 4.5 million holiday trips to countries all over the world.
It is a great paradox, which we are not aware of today, that the current favourite destination, Croatia, was not a free destination until 1989 because it was part of the former Yugoslavia.
The introduction of visa-free travel to neighbouring countries in Western Europe in the early 1990s led to a huge surge in short-term visits, particularly to Vienna and Germany.
Czechoslovaks, for a long time, did not get tired of excursions to the West, everyone wanted to see it at least for a moment.
For example, in Paris, Czech groups slept in tents in the park, since our income at that time did not allow us to pay for a hotel or a boarding house.
A typical feature of the Czechs of that time was to take food with them (canned, stewed, etc.) to save.
Another important moment was the introduction of the convertibility of the Czech koruna, so that our tourists could finally, after decades, freely buy Western currency.
Our living standards were rising, and with them the average wages, which around 1997 caused an increase in the demand for travel.
With the increase in travel demand, agencies began, from 1997 onwards, to arrange regularly for travel using charter connections, which made travel prices incredibly lower compared to the past, thanks to the possibility of obtaining discounts for passenger volume.
By the end of the 1990s, Czechs could travel without a visa to almost all developed countries except the United States, which made our travels even easier.
Another interesting moment in the history of post-revolutionary tourism happened already in 2000, when it was organized, thanks to a huge demand, the first direct flight from the Czech Republic to an exotic country, and it was to Thailand.
Since that year, direct charter flights with Czech tourists to distant and hot countries have been taking off every year.
The exotic countries are now visited by about 100,000 Czechs a year.
Another interesting moment of this epoch, symbolizing our post-revolutionary development, came in the year 2008.
On November 17, 2008, the United States abolished visas for Czech tourists, making our country one of the most developed countries in the world.
In 2008 Czechs, for the first time in their history, spent more than half of their holidays abroad (50.3%) and for the first time in their history, spent more than 15 thousand CZK per head on trips abroad, including the expenses at the place of stay.
The convened Ordinary General Assembly to elect the President, which could end up again in deadlock.
Czech football has been without a president for almost five months and it is likely that the successor to Ivan Hašek as President of the Czech Football Federation (FAČR) will not be known even after the next Extraordinary General Assembly will take place on Thursday in Nymburk.
In fact, no agreement has yet been reached on the voting rules to be followed.
Without them, you can't even vote to choose between the three candidates.
The candidates for the post of President of Czech football are Jindřich Rajchl, Miroslav Pelta and Tomáš Paclík.
Hašek resigned from his post in June not without first calling his colleagues with the purpose of finding a strong person who knew how to deal with football in the future.
However, after the Hašek era concluded, a controversy broke out between the two federations of the association unable to reach an agreement to choose a common candidate.
This was evident on September 16 when the new president had to be elected.
Delegates of the General Assembly met in vain at the National House (Národní dům), located in the Prague district of Smíchov, because talks had been blocked and not only in terms of the method of election.
No consensus was reached as to who in the General Assembly had the right to vote - only the legal representatives or also the delegates with full powers.
From that moment on, and because of this one point, there was a partial agreement, supported also by the recommendation of the Institute of State and Law, according to which representation by plenipotentiary is not possible.
However, disputes over the electoral code remain open.
The Commission has already made a number of proposals for the introduction of a new system of own resources.
The opinion on the possibility of voting has changed a couple of times already, but the neuralgic point remains the same.
The question is: how can we proceed in the third round to avoid a deadlock?
"The dispute is about whether to proceed according to the statutes or to find another model", says Dušan Svoboda, one of the three vice presidents of the FAČR, which, from the association's leadership, represents professional football.
According to the model proposed in the statutes, the candidate with the highest percentage of support in the federation to which he will present his candidacy will win in the third round.
The Moravian Region is willing to reach a compromise so that the candidate with the highest overall percentage of votes in both federations can win.
The Bohemian side, however, imposes the condition that the winner, according to these percentage calculations, must have a majority of at least two thirds.
"This would, however, take away the meaning of the previous two rounds and would completely negate the concept of a bicameral system", is how Svoboda understands the objections of the Moravian side, according to which it would be better not to touch the order and vote according to the applicable statutes.
Surprisingly, Tomaš Paclík agrees with this, although it is assumed that the electoral regulations established by the statutes of all the candidates suit Pelta better.
"I would like to see the vote as far as possible in accordance with the statutes".
"So that no nonsense is invented about the representatives as in the last General Assembly", says the owner of Victoria Plzen, who is running for the first time as a candidate and who directs his remarks mainly against Pelta.
Pelta is still optimistic.
According to him, the new president will be decided in Nymburk and he believes that the candidates in the future will cooperate constructively.
"All the passions will be appeased with today's match of our national team in the European Championship.
"Football will again be the protagonist, and this will make cooperation more enjoyable", says the representative of Jablonice, who of the three candidates has the most experience in football management, both at a professional and regional level.
Rajchl is the most reticent.
"I hope that an agreement will be reached, but unfortunately the situation is much more complicated".
"It's not about the Bohemian-Moravian conflict, but there are attempts to adjust the rules to their own convenience".
"This may result in a new blockage of the General Assembly".
"In any case, I hope common sense will prevail", Rajchl said.
There's not much time left for all parties to come to an agreement.
Some negotiations had to be held in Montenegro, but who can know until the match starts if the football team will be complete?
The special plane, in which the vice presidents Dalibor Kucera and Rajchl had to travel to Podgorica, has not left this morning due to technical problems in Prague, having to look for an alternative to transport part of the executive committee to the place where the qualifying match will take place.
Perhaps the decisive meeting, finally, could be the one to take place at ministerial level, which, they say, will be held this Wednesday.
Josef Dobeš, Minister of Education, Youth and Sports, would very much like to bring the divided parties into the most powerful sports organization in the country so that an agreement can be reached.
There is a lot at stake: State subsidies, the credibility of football and also the upcoming General Assembly of the Central Committee of the Czechoslovak Sports Federation (ČSTV) which will try to give a new direction to Czech sport after the financial problems of the Sazka lottery.
Paclík will fight for the presidency, because he can't find a more suitable candidate.
If the head of Pilsen's players, Tomaš Paclik, had known before the Extraordinary General Assembly the name of a suitable candidate who would satisfy all his ideas about the new president of the Czech Football Federation (FAČR), he would not have run as a candidate for such a relevant position.
"If there was a suitable person, I would be fighting for her and not run as a candidate for the elections".
"But until today, we have not been able to find such a person", Paclík told the Czech News Agency (ČTK).
What motivates Paclík to enter the challenge with Miroslav Pelta and Henry Rajchl is exactly the possibility of blocking Pelta, the supposed winner of the elections, who opens the way to the presidency of the Czech Football Federation (FAČR).
Paclík also points out that, if he wins, he would remain in office as president only until 2013, when the ordinary general assembly would come.
In that position, he would like to see an expert and good manager who is not too involved in football events.
"I've already spoken to some people I might consider".
"It was crazy to me to hear some say that they don't even want to identify with Czech football at the moment".
"I'd like to change that view", he adds.
What is supposedly most bothering Paclík at the moment is Pelta's relationship with the President of the Pilsen Regional Football Association Roman Berbr, a man with a controversial past, known outside the world as a powerful lobbyist with the ability to influence the voting of delegates in the general assembly.
For Paclík it is so unacceptable to see Pelta sitting in the presidential chair.
"In the event that I win, the status quo would be maintained and nothing in football would change".
"With the support of Berbra, an ambitious businessman, football will get even less profit", Paclík said.
He also mentions the fact that a few years ago Pelta's name was associated with a wiretap during the investigation of a corruption case, from which Pelta went unpunished.
"I don't know what prestige the Pelta victory could bring to football".
"And with what eyes will UEFA and FIFA look at us", said Paclík, who also takes some caution with his previous statement that he would "sell Club Pilsen if Pelta becomes president".
In case of winning Thursday's elections, Paclík could consider cooperation with Pelta in the future.
The other candidate, Rajchl, who was supported by Paclík before the September General Assembly ended in a fiasco, is of the same opinion.
"He (Pelta) would be the first one I would follow".
"He's very capable".
"I could imagine him, for example, as head of the representation".
"but not as a manager of an association".
"I don't stick my nose where I don't feel capable either", added Paclík, who in September drew a lot of attention for supporting the suspension of the Arbitration Committee chaired by Ludek Macel, later replaced by Dagmar Damkova.
Paclík admits that he would dare to manage the association.
He has used his skills in managing private companies, as he has also been the director of Pilsen since last summer, which won the first division in May with his support.
"I have the strength to change some things in the football field and contribute to its safe practice".
"To reduce the influence of some pressure groups, which probably tend to influence the decisions of the disciplinary and appeal committee, producing unpleasant situations, Paclík said without hiding his antipathies towards Sparta president Daniel Křetínský.
One of the priorities would also be to strengthen the relationship between the FAČR and the Czech Olympic Committee, with the help of which it would exert pressure on political leaders to allocate more money to the sport from lottery taxes.
"It's one of the key issues that the new president should be addressing".
"If they raise taxes on gambling, as the political parties are saying, I would support their arguments, but frankly, they have to tell us where all this money is going", he says.
Moreover, Paclík now does not even take into account his association with the Pilsner Club, although he himself states that the President of the FAČR should be "non-partisan".
Pelta is in turn associated with Jablonec and Rajchl with Dukla of Prague.
"It's not ideal".
"But I don't see the point in hypocritically giving my shares of the Pilsen Club to someone else and then returning there after a year and a half", Paclík said.
Pelta promised the FAČR new statutes that would end the deadlock of the elections.
Two days before the General Assembly of the Football Association one of the presidential candidates, Miroslav Pelt, promised that if he were elected, he would ensure that the FAČR had new statutes that would serve to definitively resolve, in the future, the controversies regarding the electoral regulation.
The representative of Jablonec is optimistic about Thursday's meeting in Nymburk, and believes that the pre-election conflict could move towards a solution today with the possible victory of the football team.
Already before the elections that were not held in September, Pelta promised to focus, if elected, precisely on representation and fundraising.
He decided to participate at the last minute in the last general assembly, so this two-month postponement could go well with him to defend and present, in a wider context, his ideas on football management.
"People at all levels have been involved in football for a long time and look forward to meeting the new president this Thursday".
"They feel that the time has come for someone to run the association", thinks the man who is mainly associated with the Jablonice Club, but who worked in the Sparta and the executive committee of the Association.
For this reason, he believes he has sufficient experience to manage Czech football.
He is convinced that behind the current problems with the elections is the euphoria that reigned in the time of Ivan Hašek.
"Unfortunately, the June General Assembly passed statutes that were not as perfect as everyone thought".
"If we exclude certain interpretations, we have had a president since September", warned Pelta.
It was precisely the readaptation of the most important document of the Civic Association that was used as a lure to win over the delegates.
"If I am elected president, I will take it as a personal challenge and I am prepared to respond in case this fails".
"It's a matter of principles, without which we cannot exist", says Pelta.
Besides, in theory, he tries not to mess with his opponents.
He had previously warned that he was working with Henry Rajchl, whom he respected for his legal background, and was aware that his opponent would also be his first vice president.
It had been a long time since he had attacked Thomas Paclík who, unlike Pelta, left no puppet with a head.
"He's been in the world of football for over a year, and he's already had some success".
"Their attacks were shameful and many people were surprised by the election campaign".
"That's why many of them doubt his true character", said his opponent Pelta, who remains faithful to the statements announced in September.
His most powerful weapon is, according to him, his knowledge of football, from the lower competitions to the higher ones.
This last one should be a showcase for football promotion.
"I would also try to solve all the scandals that arose because of the Bohemians as a result of the corruption scandal last year".
"Immediately after I would get involved in negotiations with the public and private sector, to ensure that there is enough money for all football", the 46-year-old candidate told ČTK two months ago.
He then also promised that his appointment as football president would not involve any personal modification of the staff.
"I would have to know first the tasks of each employee", he said, referring to Strahov where, after a long period of anarchy, understandable nervousness reigns.
Despite the catastrophic scenarios currently predicted for the next general assembly, he believes that the delegates will not travel in vain to Nymburk this Thursday.
"If the only point of disagreement is how to vote in the third round, we will certainly be able to overcome it.
"Football needs credibility, which will only be restored if it finally has a leader", still two days before the most decisive day in his career as a representative, Pelta remains optimistic.
Rajchl promises that under his leadership, the FAČR would start working with enthusiasm.
If the current vice-president Jindrich Rajchl is elected as the new president of the Czech Football Association at the fourth General Assembly, many people would certainly be resentful.
Rajchl promises that if he is elected, he will work hard.
He wants to implement a systematic change and make the executive committee members responsible for each area of football individually.
He also pledges to resolve the Bohemians case, improve relations with UEFA and FIFA, get more money for football and continue the work started by the previous president Ivan Hašek.
"As president, I would like to dedicate myself entirely to football".
"From international contacts with UEFA and FIFA to the national team, from professional football to the training of young high-performing footballers".
"I don't mean that I would do it all by myself", Rajchl said in an interview for ČTK.
"I am a team player and I want to divide the responsibilities of the executive committee in such a way that each member can devote himself to a specific area".
"And I will assign difficult tasks so that football can, in each of those segments, move forward with great momentum".
"A lot of people probably won't like this, because it means you start working very hard and not just criticizing the work of others", he added.
Due to the atmosphere of criticism in the football movement, he is said to have considered the possibility of not running again as a candidate.
"Everyone knows I work 20 hours a day".
"But I need to know that this will make sense and that there will not be people behind me who will hinder me and hinder me at every step", she explained the reasons for her indecision.
"Many people have told me that I should not give up, because then others would give up too".
"It's about having faith to not just give up", he said.
It is said to also motivate him to continue the work he has already started with Hašek.
"During those two years, a lot of work was done that I don't want to miss now".
"There are processes that have been started and that will have their effect in a couple of years and I would not like someone to stop them", he announced, concerned that if the other candidate, Miroslav Pelta, is elected, the situation in the association could return to the way it was before the time of Hašek.
"I believe in order, and it's something that, in my opinion, Mirek Pelta is not able to maintain.
"Behind him are all those people who would take care of football so that it would be a privilege for a select few".
"I can be blamed for a lot of things, but not for being in favor of someone".
"I try to be objective".
"I want to make football for everyone, because only then will everyone feel good and not just the chosen ones", Rajchl said.
He also rejects the idea that the president would be a bohemian.
"Although some people try to claim otherwise, I have in mind to do the maximum for Moravia".
"For example, it is time to think about splitting the second division into a Czech and a Moravian part, the winners of which would go to the first division".
"It would not be the current situation where we have only three teams from Moravia, which is a problem for young Moravian players", Rajchl said.
Although Tomaš Paclík, the president of the Pilsner Club, has joined the presidential race, Rajchl still believes in his chances of being elected.
"I still feel strong support from the Czech Federation, which elected me as its vice-president and which knows that behind me there are clear successes", said Rajchl, whose successes include saving tens of millions of crowns from disadvantageous contracts, negotiating TV contracts and negotiating the lottery law.
On the other hand, he acknowledges his share of the blame for the Federation's lack of unity.
And while proclaiming that Pelta is "disqualified to regain confidence in Czech football", he regards his other rival, Paclík, as a strong candidate who does have something to offer football.
"No one can deny that he did a great job for Pilsen that year".
"If elected, he will probably continue what Ivan Hašek has already started and not significantly change the staffing of committees".
"I don't want to use that to my advantage", he says of his rivals Rajchl.
The Most Beautiful Pools in Europe
I jump to the blue
by Julia Stanek
Pools from an incredible vantage point, sumptuous baths in Budapest: Visitors to Europe can experience its blue wonder, and after a city tour or a walk, rest their tired legs in bubbling baths.
A book shows where the best well-being is in the water.
When Iris Meder went on a research trip for the last year and a half, there was one thing that she couldn't miss in her luggage, a bathing suit.
Lying on her back over the water, she gazed at the artistic dome above, swam toward the marble angels, waiting for her at the edge of the pool, and marveled at the meticulously restored modernist indoor pool.
She liked the bathroom, and she kept a notebook in her handbook at the time of all the interesting details about the style and history of the building.
Architectural historian Meder explored more than 200 pools in this way and presents them in her recent book "Badefreuden": the covered pools in Munich, the historic bath palaces in the Black Forest, the "concrete constructions" in Taunus.
He made his "journey through the most extraordinary baths of Central Europe" through 13 countries: In addition to Germany, Austria and Switzerland, he visited places in Italy, France, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania, Poland, and a city respectively in Luxembourg, Serbia and Croatia.
This 46-year-old German is a true enthusiast of bath culture.
He doesn't want to have anything to do with sports, says Meder, only the water is different.
He is only annoyed that bathers have to settle for blue tiles and the smell of chlorine, while joggers can breathe in the fascinating smell of the fir forest or hear the happy songs of the birds in the park.
"I once wondered why swimming pools always have to be so ugly", says this Viennese woman.
"I started collecting pretty pools".
The surface of the water duplicates the architecture.
The well-being factor in swimming pools is so great because all the senses are served, according to Meder.
And if the builder makes an effort, the indoor pools can be a real treat to the eye: "Instead of floor, the bathrooms have a water surface".
"On the one hand it is transparent, on the other hand it reflects the beauty of the whole building".
Everything is optically folded: the high vaults, the colored tiles, the trampolines.
The small-format photography book "Badefreuden" provides very interesting information on architecture and art history in the historical oases of welfare in 190 pages, but above all it makes you want to jump into the blue.
Meder, the pool collector, discovers the outstanding specimens in her research in Hungary.
Along with the magnificent medicinal baths such as the 100-year-old Széchenyi Bath in Budapest, there are the nitrate waters in a unique karst cavity (cavity baths in Miskolc-Tapolca), as well as some thermal baths, whose pools are alkaline waters and are located in a bottle-shaped building (Városimál Terfürdö in Jászberény).
Many open-air pools in Switzerland and Austria offer spectacular views: While the whole city looms over the Zurich rooftop pool, one can look out onto the snow-covered Arlberb from the outdoor pool of a bath in St. Anton, and: In the Turkish bath there is a window from which one can observe the practice on the ski slopes.
Perhaps the most extraordinary design awaits guests in Längenfeld: The Ötztal Water Cathedral looks like a UFO that has just landed in the Alps.
From three open springs, steam rises in winter, while the Ötztal mountains rise to the sky in the background.
The Alhambra in the Black Forest
Meder, the pool collector, was not bothered by the smell of chlorine in all the pools.
Many thermal baths smell of sulfur, in the baths of Árpád in Békescsaba, Hungary, the diesel plague is so strong that people think they have reached a bathroom.
The smell comes from the medicinal waters that contain bicarbonate and alkali and whose sap sticks to the skin when entering the pool, a special kind of well-being.
Iris Meder also got disappointed in one place in her search for nice places for bathing, when she wanted to visit open pools and sunbaths in the Czech Luhatschowitz bath, she found a blocked ground.
The 1902 bathroom by architect Duan Jurkovic was closed.
When Meder looked through the collapsed windows of the red, white and yellow modernist building, he saw weeds growing among the tiles.
The decadence was countered by a lovely pool in the Black Forest: the Thermal Palace at Bad Wildbald.
These baths have three phases of construction behind them; not only can you discover neo-Romanesque elements from the time of its construction in 1844, but also an Arabic Alhambra style hall, added in 1900.
Since its painstaking modernization in 1995, the Thermal Palace has been the favorite bath of pool collector, Iris Meder, and not just because it is natural of the Black Forest.
"It is a great achievement to fuse different architectural styles into such a fantastic unity", says Meder.
In a palace like this, the immersion in the thermal pool is apparently of little importance.
Agricultural speculation
Deutsche Bank looks at the commodities business
by Christian Teevs
Does Deutsche Bank give up its agricultural commodities business?
According to information from SPIEGEL-ONLINE, Josef Ackermann has commissioned a working group to examine the consequences of speculation for the poor of the world.
In January, the head of the consortium wants to show the consequences.
Hamburg, Germany
The issue is clear to the public, according to one study, 84 per cent of Germans do not think it acceptable for banks to speculate on agricultural commodities such as wheat or maize.
Two thirds of those polled claim that Deutsche Bank and other lending institutions are withdrawing from this business because it intensifies the problems of the world's poorest.
This is the result of a survey commissioned by the consumer organization Foodwatch.
The study is based on a report submitted to Foodwatch in mid-October.
Author Harald Schumann shows that bets on global commodity markets drive up prices, and banks bear the responsibility for the world hunger problem.
The consumer advocate's campaign is specifically directed at Josef Ackermann, the head of Deutsche Bank, although large banks such as Goldman Sachs or Morgan Stanley are similarly active.
Originally, commodity bets were intended to protect traders from price swings.
Leading experts agree that the players have become uncoupled from supply and demand, and they profit from the costs of the poorest.
Ackermann reacted to the criticism differently than U.S. competitors: He promised to review the claims and said that no business "deserves to compromise the good reputation of Deutsche Bank".
According to SPIEGEL ONLINE, an international working group is reviewing the claims in the Foodwatch report.
The analysis should be completed by the end of the year, then the results will be presented to the management of Deutsche Bank, together with the recommendation of how to handle the matter.
The bank's management will report on the consequences at the end of January.
The raw materials business could eventually be reduced or even abandoned altogether.
Ackermann is trying to fix his image.
Thilo Bode, founder of Foodwatch, welcomed the news but reaffirmed his criticism of the financial sector: "The betting on rising food prices shows especially dramatically how ruthless banks are currently harming the public welfare".
Ackermann stands as the biggest bank lobbyist, especially in bonds.
"Deutsche Bank must cancel all investments in its portfolio in which it puts food price betting money at stake", Bode said.
"It doesn't matter if Ackermann is talking about people going hungry or the reputation of Deutsche Bank".
Ackermann's inspection is surprising at first sight, but it is clear that the head of the consortium wants to offer a perfect image a few months before leaving his post.
On Monday, Deutsche Bank published that the chairman of the board of directors will change something different from the unplanned in the board of directors.
By abandoning the controversial agricultural speculation, he can perfect his image.
And you need to care as little as possible losses, that will be taken care of by your successor.
Two thirds would cancel the investment in raw materials
Foodwatch is trying to keep the pressure on the manager high.
So far, more than 30,000 netizens have participated in the organization's campaign.
On Tuesday, Bode published the survey for which the Forsa Institute had asked 1,001 people on November 7 and 8.
Only 10 percent thought it legitimate for Deutsche Bank to offer investments in which food prices were staked.
Many of the bank's clients showed personal consequences upon discovering that their bank was involved in such businesses: according to the survey, two-thirds would cancel all investments from which money comes from land speculation.
43 percent would advise against such a bank to their acquaintances, 49 percent would, after reflection, cancel their account and move to another institution.
The 21st house in Vienna
The pavilion moved
♪ I'm not gonna let you down ♪
An architectural story with ups and downs and a happy ending, the pavilion of the 1958 Austrian Universal Exhibition in Brussels won awards, was in Vienna for a museum, became empty and fell apart.
Now it's reopened as an exhibition hall.
Post-modern architecture is passionate about the clear forms, glass halls, bold curves and new building materials, typical of thinking about technical progress, for which, the Austrian pavilion of architect Karl Schwanzer for the Brussels Universal Exhibition of 1958 is a suitable and well-known example.
Schwanzer's Pavilion then won the Grand Prix de l'Architecture for its light and floating construction of steel and glass.
The building is still considered a contemporary architectural landmark.
It made the architect so well known that he also built the Austrian pavilion at the next world exhibition.
With its legendary four-cylinder tower for MBW plus the adjacent building flattened in Munich, it became internationally known.
Its pavilion, designed as a temporary exhibition building was erected after the world exhibition in the Schweizer Garten next to the Vienna South station, was renovated in 1962 and inside was inaugurated a 20th century museum, it was called the "house 20".
The building was adequate but lacked the right spaces and technology for a museum; no walls to hang art, no good atmosphere.
It was nevertheless used until contemporary art in Vienna had a new home.
The building has been empty since 2001 and is falling apart.
Currently, the architect Adolf Krischanitz reformed the pavilion, now calls it "house 21" and will be used in the future as a museum of contemporary art.
On Tuesday afternoon the Belvedere Museum, to which the house belongs, was inaugurated with the first exhibition, a stroke of luck in a way.
Agnes Husslein-Arco, the new director of the Austrian Belvedere gallery since 2007, made a fresh start.
Husslein-Arco, a doctor of art history with a considerable career, among other things, as an ice skater in her youth, later at Sotheby's, the Guggenheim Museum and founding director of the Salzburg Museum of Modern Art, carried out the reforms at the insistence of politicians and protectors of the monuments, provided public funds and private sponsors and established their use.
Apart from contemporary art, the works of the sculptor Fritz Wotruba of the homonymous foundation are exhibited, there should be a cafeteria and a bookshop and also an office building.
Strict control, low budget
Krischanitz was the best choice to do it.
Not only because he sensitively reformed the secession of Joseph Olbrichs in Vienna, expanded it and was awarded the competition, but also because he studied with Schwanzwer at the Technical University of Vienna and the pavilion was for him an "important and immense place", in which he contemplated "almost every weekend" the exhibitions.
He knew the project and the problem of the building, which disappeared with its transfer to Vienna in its change of use with generosity and ease.
In the current reforms there are big problems, the building was "an energy eater", Krischanitz said.
The profile of the windows of the glass facade was changed, a fiberglass-reinforced insulating glass was installed and the glass ceiling was replaced with a special safety glass.
Thermal bridges and steel beams were reinforced or replaced and asbestos roofs rehabilitated.
Two basements were used for the new use, a light panel descended between the house and the street provides the lighting, a bridge serves to enter the almost new building, but still the pavilion of Schwanzer.
The original exterior doors remain, the house is painted in old mahogany tones and protected against rusting.
And the movie theater is exactly as it was before.
And all this with strict control by the monument office and a low budget.
"I often had to find material that was good, cheap and also liked by the monument protection office", says Krischanitz, noting a rough floor in the basement.
Despite all the pressures, problems and reforms, the building remains flexible and light.
The pavilion "that came from Brussels" has been difficult, said Krischanitz recently, a typical "casual appearance in the history of the city".
Such architecture is "always in the wrong place" and that's why I wanted to "awaken the right consciousness".
In this case, the 21st house is not in the wrong place, it is a stroke of urban luck. The totally new and planned "central station district", with housing and offices, is next to the Schweizer Garten.
And perhaps there's another stroke of luck: House 21 could be bolstered by another Krischanitz building, as collector Francesca von Habsburg has bought the Berlin temporary art gallery and is reportedly negotiating with the city for a neighboring space in the Schweizer Garten.
Deutsche Bahn is planning a winter crisis package worth millions
The company has devised a crisis plan, which would prevent train breakdowns in winter.
The number of staff must be doubled.
Which costs millions.
In the fight against train breakdowns and delays caused by winter, Deutsche Bahn has spent more than 70 million euros this year, according to a news report.
The newspaper Bild reported that the planned investments up to 2005 amounted to some EUR 300 million, citing an internal crisis plan of the group.
The Commission has already taken steps to ensure that the railway network is not affected by the weather.
Among other things, it is planned to double internal and external employees to 16,000 positions to remove snow from tracks and platforms.
The goal is to clear the snow and ice platforms for operation and 90 percent of the needles needed for operation within four to five hours.
Two months ago, Rüdiger Grube, president of Deutsche Bahn, warned of train breakdowns and delays this winter as well after a summit with the government and industry.
Last winter Deutsche Bahn suffered considerable problems in passenger transport, as, among other things, it lacked reserves in the face of adverse weather conditions.
Many new regional trains have been waiting for years for a permit from the federal railroad office.
Also there's a delay in the delivery of the high-speed trains.
Deutsche Bahn has been working for years to check the axles of high-speed trains frequently in the workshop, after a high-speed train suffered a breakdown of an axle in the central station of Cologne.
Deutsche Bank is paying millions in fines in the US.
After the riot over President Josef Ackerman, a new problem from the US arises, Deutsche Bank must pay a fine of millions there.
As if the problems were not enough for Deutche Bank, its past in the US acquires the sector giant, the Frankfurt Institute pays $ 145 million (106 million euros) in a deal, to end the strife due to the bankruptcy of five major credit unions during the financial crisis.
It's about the sale of mortgage securities.
The financial markets regulator NCUA is blaming many large banks for inducing credit unions with false promises to buy financial products; they have minimized the risks.
Such securities lost value during the financial crisis and are dragging banks into the depths.
"We are pleased to be able to clarify the matter without the parties having to go to court", said a spokesman for Deutsche Bank in New York.
The bank admits no fault with the settlement.
This also applies to Citigroup, which has committed a payment of $20.5 million.
Debbie Matz, president of the NCUA, celebrated the deference of both financial institutions.
The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) is responsible for U.S. credit unions and provides bankruptcy support to protect customer investments.
The NCUA is trying to reinstate the millions of dollars in losses it has caused.
The deals currently closed are the first of their kind.
The regulator had also called other big banks to account and in the summer brought lawsuits against JPMorgan Chase, the Royal Bank of Scotland and Goldman Sachs.
In the case of doubtful mortgage bonds, the issue is so-called mortgage-backed securities.
These are based on home loans.
When the US housing bubble burst in 2007, it led to the downfall of many financial institutions.
In September 2008, at the height of the financial crisis, the American investment bank Lehman Brothers collapsed.
Although the results happened a few years ago, there is a complicated wind blowing for US banks.
Investors and the inspectorate have brought countless cases to recover damages or to punish wrongdoing.
The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) has produced the most claims.
It blames the 18 major international banks that the two US state mortgage agencies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have taken advantage of the mortgage business in a volume of approximately 200 billion dollars.
Also Deutsche Bank has a demand of the FHFA, it is business worth 14.2 billion dollars from the year 2005 to 2007.
The inspection requires the Frankfurt Institute to account for "substantial losses", without naming an exact figure.
Deutsche Bank has rejected the debts as unfounded and explained that it wants to defend itself.
Warren Buffett is contributing $10 billion to IBM.
The financial guru, Buffett, is heavily invested in the information technology company IBM.
Since March, it has acquired shares worth more than ten billion dollars.
Until now, the great American investor Warren Buffett has always stated that he does not invest in computer companies or Information Technology companies because the forecasts of the long-term development of the companies are negative.
But he read the IBM trade report and changed his mind about investing in the sector.
He should have understood much earlier that IBM primarily provides services and procures computer systems for the IT departments of other companies.
In the financial world, an investment by Warren Buffett is considered an honor.
So, the Information Technology primitive should be called "Sir IBM".
Buffett revealed today on CNBC's economic news that he has acquired IBM stock worth $10.7 billion since March.
His Berkshire Hathaway investments have elevated him to one of the largest shareholders in IBM with a 5.5 percent stake.
Buffett said IBM didn't know about the compromise until now.
He praised the management that dealt with the ordinary benefits in the economic crisis.
"They've done a great job", Buffett said of the strategy.
IBM has for some time established lucrative information technology services such as the operation of computing centres.
The 100-year-old computer pioneer also offers software and consultancy as well as powerful business equipment.
Buffett avoided tech companies until now.
He said he only invested in companies whose business he understood.
Instead, Buffett took the opportunity on a freight train, at a lubricant manufacturer or a mechanical engineer.
His Berkshire Hathaway owns about 80 subsidiaries of its own, as well as part of a whole series of large consortia such as Coca-Cola or Munich Re, formerly Münchener Rück.
Buffett, 81, took over the small textile company Berkshire Hathaway in the 1960s and, with wise investments, expanded it into one of the most valuable companies in the world.
Yet, his life-style is humble.
That's why he's an idol to countless investors around the world.
His quick and unerring sense of making money has earned him the nickname "Omaha's oracle".
After discovering Buffett's investment, IBM's stock price jumped by one percent.
"The Blue Giant", as IBM is known, has a market value of over $220 billion and ranks alongside Apple and Microsoft among the most valuable technology companies in the world.
Buffett said he did not want to work with Microsoft.
Bill Gates, its founder, is a close friend.
The threat becomes concrete
After the discovery of the Zwickau cell, the Turkish media have doubts about the German rule of law.
A newspaper speaks of a "bloody ideology" that is reviving.
The murders of eight small businessmen, Greek and Greek, between 2001 and 2006 have a far-right background.
In Turkey and among the German population of Turkish origin, there has been a reaction of fear and concern at this news.
For many Germans of Turkish origin, a ghost is returning that was long thought to be dead. Since the arson attacks in Mölln in November 1992 and Solingen in May 1993, there have been no further episodes of far-right violence against Turks.
However, the existence of xenophobia in Germany has never been questioned.
The ultra-right network discovered reveals a magnitude whose dimensions were not, far from it, predictable.
"Is the bloody ideology reviving again?" is the headline of the online edition of the Turkish newspaper "Haberturk".
The newspaper "Sabah" on the other hand, highlights that one of the perpetrators of the crime was an informant of the Federal Office for the Defense of the Constitution and expresses concern that the German authorities may be involved in the far-right plot.
The Turkish community in Germany reacted sensibly, remembering the victims of racist violence with a vigil at the Brandenburg Gate over the weekend.
Two weeks earlier, the Turkish community in Berlin, together with German and Turkish politicians, held a solemn event to mark the fiftieth anniversary of the Turkish-German agreement.
The coexistence was staged with cheerful colors, like a story with a happy ending.
The information came as a slap to some Turkish media: "The German gift for the fiftieth anniversary", reads the title of an article on the Turkish Internet platform "Haber X", referring to the background of the chain of murders.
The German broadcaster Hürriyet does not insist on making this mental connection either.
"It's starting to smell bad", reads the title of Ahmet Külahci's column.
It is worth noting that those killed were people who paid their taxes and made an important contribution with their work to the reconstruction of Germany.
On the Internet forums of Germans of Turkish origin, the behaviour of the police and their subsequent success in the searches are discussed very critically.
The authors are astonished that the German authorities did not look for suspects in the ultra-right circle much earlier.
Some are at least rhetorical about the drastic measures: 'From now on, we are lost here, the immigrants have only self-defence and weapons left.'
"This will be the best self-protection".
"Germany's internal peace depends heavily on the quality of the clarification and the adequacy of the sanction to the entire network"., writes "Selen".
Which means that if the internal peace of Germany is in danger, the attacks at Mölln and Solingen will be cleared up in ninety years.
The image of the ruins of the fire of Solingen has been etched into German and Turkish memories.
No other event has shown more clearly to the Turks living here that there is a real threat and to the Germans that mistrust and distance can lead to violence.
The attacks are heightening the group feeling on the Turkish side.
Don't repeat the mistakes of the past
The Turkish press then mainly criticized the shortcomings of German policy after the attacks, Helmut Kohl refusing to visit the survivors of Mölln.
After the fire-shaped attack in Solingen, he sent a telegram of condolence to the Turkish President and Klaus Kinkel, his Minister of Foreign Affairs, replaced him at the funeral in Cologne.
It's clear how a person's value is calculated by the amount of his taxes.
The current information from the Turkish media once again shows how deep the distrust of many Germans of Turkish origin has been in the legality of this country ever since.
In addition to the effort of a broad explanation and a reassessment of far-right terrorism in Germany, frank words are needed this time.
The Lake Zurich scandal bank
The most risky bank in Europe is not in Italy or France, but in Switzerland.
UBS nearly went bankrupt in the financial crisis and since then it's slipped from one crisis to the next.
It's run by a German now.
Axel Weber certainly hadn't thought of that.
After his spectacular departure from the top of the federal bank, in July it became known that in 2013 he would start in a new and almost equally spectacular job: Chairman of the board of the large Swiss bank UBS, an unexpected and lucrative step in his career.
Axel Weber is publicly happy, praises Switzerland for its beauty and UBS for its newfound strength and drops some kind remarks about his future colleagues.
"USB has achieved a revitalization".
"I am pleased to collaborate with Kaspar Villiger and Oswald Grübel".
By September it was clear that everything would be totally different.
A bank security system was bypassed by a USB financial operator in London and 1.7 billion euros was defrauded.
Oswald Grübel, the CEO of the USB, a banker not only known in Switzerland, had to come.
The chairman of the board of the USB was considered equally touched, and everyone asked: When will Axel Weber arrive?
It became known that Weber will be advising the bank from February 2012.
And he will take over the presidency of the board in May, not early 2013, as the bank announced on Tuesday.
This is hard on Axel Weber.
He's not a banker, but rather, an economics professor and a counselor and he's had a period of adaptation that's certainly needed.
It is therefore responsible for the strategy of a bank which has just proved once again that it deserves the title of 'Europe's biggest scandal bank' for some time.
On the one hand, the USB is huge, until recently it was the world's largest asset manager, and on the other hand, for years, it has been sliding from one scandal to the next.
Nothing, it seems, is spared the once proud Swiss bank.
The financial crisis began.
USB had an excellent reputation until 2007.
The image of the Swiss asset manager discreet and solid, but also cunning, was combined with ambitious goals, also wanted to be a big number in investment banks.
On the one hand, with $1.6 trillion, the U.S. Bank manages more money from wealthy clients than any other bank in the world.
And on the other hand, it advanced as an investment bank into the league of the world's great banks.
This is impressive.
Hans Geiger, the former banker and later professor of banking in Zurich for many years, explains: "In front of my students, I have always described the USB as a model of a good bank".
"From the current point of view, one wonders, how could I be wrong?"
I was in a big mistake.
In 2007 it came to light that something went very wrong with the USB.
In the middle of the year, Peter Wuffli, the managing director, who until then was considered a brilliant and very intelligent banker, resigned surprisingly.
A few months later, the reason was suspected.
The bank's investment fund went into a loss-making high-risk securities and had to write off billions.
To support this, the USB announced a capital injection of no less than 13 billion francs.
For this, he found investors, naturally some looked down on until a little while ago: an Asian, opaque Singapore state fund and an Arab state fund, so discreet, its name had never been heard.
This was just the first hit.
In April 2008, it got worse.
The bank had to declare billions of dollars in losses, Marcel Ospel, chairman of the board, in 2006 in the second highest paid board in Switzerland, resigned.
In October 2008, the catastrophe continued, in view of its wrong investments, UBS found itself in the financial crisis before the bankruptcy and had to be rescued by the state.
The national bank bought problematic securities from UBS for many billions, the Swiss Confederation gave six billion francs for a bond obligatoriously convertible, by which it became co-owner of the bank.
All of Switzerland was affected, it was said how dramatic this was for a small country, if it hosts such large banks.
Finally, the balance sheet of UBS in 2007 was more than five times larger than the Swiss economic results (see graph).
"We cannot bail out UBS again", said Geiger, a banking expert.
The first catastrophe was joined by the second.
A few months later, UBS capitulated to a tax conflict with America and was willing to hand over the data of wealthy clients, who had possibly evaded taxes with the bank's help.
In addition, it approves a figure of 780 billion dollars, reimbursement of unjustified profits from these businesses with a compensation payment.
UBS thus more or less confessed to having helped in the tax fraud.
Simultaneously, he lost something that had always been his capital in competition for rich clients: the halo of discretion.
After the scandal, the Swiss bank secret is no longer the same.
This was followed by the resignation of the chairman of the board of directors and the chairman of the board of directors.
And the exodus of client funds.
Thus, in a few months the bank lost its credibility in its two core sectors: in investment banking through misguided speculation and in asset management through aid to tax fraud.
And just when things were getting a little bit easier, just when you thought UBS was going to get it right again, this unfortunate story of the operator happens, an individual operator defrauded 1.7 billion euros, before the bank realized that something was wrong.
And it turned out, apparently, this still doesn't work well with risk management in investment banking.
"The Adoboli case shows that risk controls have changed too little", says Martin Janssen, professor of economics and finance at the Banking Institute of the University of Zurich.
The chief financial officer of a large German bank is also sure: "The problem with UBS is that it does not master risk controls".
This gave rise to the idea of prudence, which Swiss bankers had long presented themselves as the guardians of the world's greatest assets: no risk too great, instead, the security of money wants to break on the other side of the Alpine republic.
Swiss bank safe deposits were the symbol of unwavering reliability, like Lindt and Sprüngli of authentic chocolate.
UBS's headquarters in Zurich doesn't fit the cliché of the solid Swiss private bank, it's just a little bigger.
The situation is classic.
The bank has its headquarters on Zurich's Bahnhofstraße, which runs from the main station directly to Lake Zurich, framed by the snow-capped peaks of the Swiss mountains.
The buildings here are ostentatious, the rents are some of the highest in Europe.
Here you find jewelry shops such as Tiffany `s among traditional Swiss businesses such as the Sprüngli confectionery.
Swiss banks have been housed here for years, from the national bank to the Credit Suisse palace to elite private banks like Julius Bär.
The entrance to the UBS reception room is through a heavy revolving door.
Inside the walls are covered with marble, in front are large leather chairs, next to the bank logo is a large sign to indicate "security".
UBS knows what the client is looking for here: security.
The two big Swiss banks, UBS and Credit Suisse, have at some point displaced the idea of the big Swiss bank, or have betrayed it, as the president of a small Swiss private bank believes.
He prefers not to read his name in the newspaper, after all he does, like all Swiss bankers, also with the business of both big banks.
UBS has become too big, he says, particularly in investment banking, where the Anglo-Saxons have gained ground.
The Swiss had nothing more to say.
"And they have long been accustomed to the customs of the Anglo-Saxons".
In fact, UBS changed the Anglo-Saxon investment banking, delivered its first big profit and then disaster came, no European financial institution had lost as much money in the jungle of high risk as the big Swiss bank.
On October 15, 2008, the catastrophe was evident.
"And on Wednesday the government coalition of the small country of seven million decided on the biggest rescue operation in the history of their nation", writes author Lukas Hässig in his book "Der UBS-Crash" ("The UBS Crash").
Politicians gave up to 68 billion francs or about 45 billion euros to save the big bank from bankruptcy.
How could you?
We talk to the Swiss bankers, they see the problem in the UBS dimension.
In June 1998, two of the three largest Swiss banks merge into a powerful consortium.
A bank emerges which, because of the merger, was too big for the small Switzerland, and continues to grow.
This was the reason why the two different banks that had preceded UBS complemented each other: a rich but dormant bank with its wealth management centre in Zurich and a poorer but stronger internationalisation.
Suddenly, the international investment banks arrived in a timely manner with a lot of money, with which they could roll a big financial bicycle.
There are two names associated with this rise of UBS: Peter Wuffli, head of the UBS consortium from 2001 to 2007, and Marcel Ospel, then chairman of the board of directors.
"I always thought Wuffli and Ospel were a perfect team", says banking expert Hans Geiger.
"Wuffli, the intellectual, modest, who understands a lot about models and statistics, and Ospel, the intuitive who managed to make his way from the apprentice in the bank to the top".
Finally, Ospel has trusted Wuffli.
And in the end, Wuffli probably made a decisive mistake: "He thought his models were reality", says Geiger.
"This is a tragic case".
Tragic, perhaps. What is it?
Clearly, the folly came before the case.
The employees of UBS clearly remember the board meetings, where Wuffli, the head of the consortium, always repeated the same slogan: Get down from the throne to Goldman Sachs.
The American bank was the most powerful investment bank in the world.
They topped the league tables, the rankings that then documented the banks' success.
UBS wanted to be on top.
Some of the steps were good.
In foreign exchange and stock trading, he was at the top.
However, the business advisors in charge highlighted a weakness: In the international interest business, in the language of fixed income banking, there is huge compensation for the big banks.
UBS has gaps in American mortgage products.
To fill these gaps, UBS embarked on an adventure that almost cost it its existence.
Avid for growth, they invested both the same bank and one of their hedge funds created in American hedge funds.
It became a powerful machine for securitizing American mortgages and then selling them, taking certain risks on its own.
And also, like other banks he sought the downside for a long time.
"In the summer of 2007, as the American real estate market was on fire, UBS bought there", said Geiger, a banking expert.
So great the euphoria, so deep the fall.
One manager had to leave, as the attempt to sort was more complicated than they expected.
The UBS posts became projectable seats and are unsafe to this day.
Nowadays, whoever runs a big bank has a job that's almost impossible.
You have to find a strategy for a bank, against which all logical business models are lost.
Geiger, an expert in banking, has an idea, to end investment banking, concentrate on asset management, return to the Swiss roots.
The bank doesn't want to go that far (yet).
But investment banking must be greatly reduced, it is clear at present.
Next Thursday, Sergio Ermotti, the bank's new president, will present his future strategy to the world.
In reality, the 51-year-old Italian-Swiss was only thought of as a temporary solution, as the bank had surprisingly split from its predecessor Grübel.
Meanwhile, he has prevailed: He must permanently run the UBS business, the bank in Zurich said on Tuesday.
Ermotti wants to return the investment bank to its mid-1990s state.
Take out the 3,500 posts.
But this is not enough.
UBS needs a vision.
Who is this?
What do you want to make money on?
These are the questions Axel Weber is probably asking himself these days.
So far he's only said he'll first look for a place with his wife in Zurich.
The next year.
Fear of recession in Europe weighs on the US stock market
The impending recession in Europe has scared American investors at the beginning of the week.
The changes of government in Athens and Rome remain in force.
The continent's sluggish industrial production is dampening hopes of stabilizing a debt-driven crisis at its source.
General relief might not be imposed on the changes of government in Rome and Athens.
The euro fell against the dollar.
Last week, the Italian and Greek cup was half full, not half empty, but now the problems are coming to the fore again, said Mark Luschini of Janney Montgomery Scott.
First of all, financial assets are listed in the sales list.

Which created skepticism among American investors: "We are not an island, but dependent", said Steve Goldman of Goldman Management.
Europe cannot be freed so quickly from a recession, and there are more signs of weakness in the banks.
Warren Buffett, the investment legend, only confirmed this caution, it is still unclear whether Europe is strong enough to do everything necessary to end the crisis, he said in an interview for CNBC.
It is therefore too early from their point of view to invest in state loans or European banks.
Instead, it's throwing a decade-old principle overboard and entering the American tech sector.

Smart cities are spreading
In many places, the great apes are considered "problem birds" - these highly intelligent animals are not driven out of cities for long, say experts.
Some like them, others want to get rid of them very quickly, the grajos have belonged for years to the image of the city, but in many municipalities the complaints of the neighbors accumulate for the dirt and the noise of the animals.
But no means of combating "problem birds" has yet been found.
The grachos are no longer moving out of cities, say experts at the first grachos symposium in Leer, East Frisia.
There, specialists from all over the country discuss possible solutions.
They look for alternatives in cities
Environmentalists attribute the problems of cities to the rural migration of certain protected grasslands; chemical applications in agriculture are visibly destroying traditional living spaces.
Hunting, increased building, and falling trees make life difficult for the birds.
The grajos are protected.
There are large colonies with over 600 breeding pairs in Soest, Westphalia, among others, in the northwest, among others in Jever, Diepholz and Achim in Bremen, as well as in Leer.
There in 2005 a controversial project to mass kill the district's grajos jumped to the negative headlines.
Critics have called the hunting of animals with bird traps and the killing with sticks especially brutal.
"Expelling and driving them away normally does not achieve anything", said Werner Klöver, a Leer town planner and landscape designer.
Water-busting of nests or the removal of trees are often unintended consequences, says Manfred Kaiser, an environmental expert from Lahr, Baden-Württemberg.
"Animals drift, large colonies divide and distribute elsewhere".
The only exception to this is in hospitals, nursing homes or schools.
"We must live with them, we no longer catch them".
Without the surrounding area, the problem in the cities cannot be solved, says Wolfgang Kellner, mayor of Leer.
It's a possible combination of driving animals away from sensitive residential areas and baiting them to settle elsewhere.
"Information boards instead of chain saws" Uta Maria Jürgens, psychologist and ethnologist, is advertising against the treatment of animals in a totally different way: "The best thing is that we can take a beak in the face with aplomb".
Jürgens co-founded the Ascheberger's ratings teaching circuit in Schleswig-Holstein, where signs inform about the life of intelligent birds.
Meanwhile, the project is embraced by tourists.
Jürgens also has his own opinion on criticism of bird noise: "They are all forms of communication, they have a lot to say".
The intelligence and skill of these animals are legendary, the grajos not only exploit resources to access mouthfuls of schist, but also manufacture tools to use them as resources.
Recently, ethologists at Cambridge University tested the intelligence of birds to four degrees.
In one experiment, the birds quickly learned to drop a stone on a platform to reach a moth larva.
Without much training, they determined with determination the size and shape the stone must have to fall on the platform.
In a second test, the shrewd Greeks had to solve a complicated problem.
The researchers placed a small bucket with a moth larva in a vertical cylinder.
The birds couldn't reach their prey with their beaks.
But the researchers left them a piece of wire.
With which the four animals formed a hook, with which they fished the bucket into the tube-pulling device.
Three of the four greys got it on the first try.
Portugal in the Euro 2012 thanks to Cristiano Ronaldo
The Bosnians and the Turks have no hope in the championship.
The favourites, Portugal, Croatia, the Czech Republic and Ireland will also be in the Euro 2012.
Portugal, the Czech Republic, Croatia and Ireland have sealed the last tickets for Euro 2012 in Poland and Ukraine in the play-offs.
Led by triumphant hero Cristiano Ronaldo (8., 53), Portugal beat Bosnia-Herzegovina 6-2 (2-1) and, after a 0-0 draw in the first leg, made five consecutive appearances in the European Championship.
The Czechs got 1-0 (0-0) in the second leg of the play-offs against outsider Montenegro, after they left things clear in the first leg (2-0).
Croatia didn't let them score in the 0-0 against Turkey, Ireland got a weak 1-1 (1-0) against Estonia.
Nani (24.), Helder Postiga (72., 82.) and Miguel Veloso (80.) scored the other goals for Portugal.
Former Bundesliga professional Zvjezdan Misimovic with a penalty (41.) and captain Emir Spahic (65.) shortened distances twice for Bosnia.
Sena Lulic got a red card (54.).
Bosnia lost to Portugal in the 2010 World Cup play-offs.
At the Estadio da Luz in Lisbon, Portugal started off in perfect fashion.
Ronaldo executed a free-throw from over 30 yards to take the lead in the points.
A quarter of an hour later, Nani showed his skills to score from a distance and got the 2-0 from 25 meters.
The Bosnians, who didn't shine in the first half hour, had their first clear chance thanks to goal scorer Edin Dzeko.
The former Wolfsburg player, leader of English Manchester City sent a header to the stick, but the ball did not cross the goal line (33).
Jiracek hit for the Czech Republic .
Next, the college Wolfgang Stark, from Ergolding, was in the eye of the hurricane.
After the attack on Helder Postiga in the area of Bosnian penati, he decided to show the Portuguese the yellow card for throwing himself on the ground (36.).
On the opposite side, Stark scored a controversial penalty following an action by Fabio Coentrao, which transformed Misimovic.
After the break, the 2004 European runner-up cleared up the score with 4 goals.
The Czechs ended the last doubt in the 81st minute with a goal from Petr Jiracek.
The 1976 European champion qualifies for the European Championship for the fifth time in a row.
Coach Michal Bilek's team with Bundesliga legionnaire Michael Kadlec (Bayer Leverkusen) and Tomas Pekhart (1. FC Nürnberg) also had luck and had to overcome a second of reaction in the initial phase.
In the last moment, goalkeeper Petr Cech avoided a possible goal in the own goal by Tomas Sivok (9.).
Montenegro had more chances with the duo Stevan Jovetic and Dejan Damjanovic in action.
Damjanovic scored in the 40th minute from the front turn, very right on Cech's goal.
After the break the Czechs had to protect the goalkeeper's wide-angle, the FC Seoul striker again escaped (50.).
Finally, the goal before the end decided the match.
Meanwhile, Turkey wasted Zagreb's football wonder.
Four days after the 0-3 in Istanbul, the Turks didn't go from a 0-0 in Zagreb.
While it was almost certain that national coach Guus Hiddink would have to leave his third-placed bench seat at the 2002 World Cup, the Croatians celebrated their fourth appearance in the Euro Cup final.
In front of 31,000 spectators at the Maksimir Stadium, the Turks almost got a dream start.
In the seventh minute and with a long-distance kick, Selcuk Inan only managed to touch the post.
After the second reaction, Croatia took more and more control.
After the break, Croatia didn't let any goal go to them.
Along with Mario Mandzukic of VfL Wolfsburg, who in the 62nd minute put a stop to Ivan Perisic of Dortmund, Danijel Pranjic (Bayern Munich) and Gordon Schildenfeld (Eintracht Frankfurt) are the legionaries of the Bundesliga in practice.
Trapattoni is going to the European Cup
In Dublin, the Irish celebrate their first appearance at the European Championship since 1988 in Germany.
Stephen Ward led coach Giovanni Trapattoni's team, who won 4-0 in the first leg set for a pre-decision, to take the lead in the 32nd minute.
Konstantin Vassiljev (57.) tied with the guest team.
Ireland pressed from the start, but had to wait until the 23rd minute, when Robbie Keane of the LA Galaxy got his first big break.
From the first moment, the Estonian defense avoided possible goals of advantage.
But in the 32nd minute, he overtook him.
After a defense by goalkeeper Pavel Londak, Ward appeared and kicked the ball across the line, making it 1-0.

SAP wants to double its number of employees in China
SAP, Europe's largest software maker, is investing billions in China over the next few years and wants to almost double its number of employees in the country.
Up to 2015, approximately two billion dollars (approximately 1.5 billion euros) will circulate, the dax consortium reported on Tuesday.
"We will get more facilities for research and development and we will hire workers", said Bill McDermott, co-chairman, at a conference in Beijing.
The staff must grow from the current 2,500 to 4,500.
The number of branches of the international market leader for business software will double from five to ten or eleven.

Massacre on a personal level
Peter Englund's intense and generous new book, The Beauty and the Sorrow: An Intimate Story of World War I, "begins with a long dramatis personae of the kind that can make one's soul drop to its feet.
Here are some action tips: Gently pull up this page and turn it into your trademark pages.
You'll get to know these people very well in Mr. Englund's novel-like narrative, and this dramatis personae will act as your GPS, a beacon during those few moments when, as one of your men and women, you're confused and helpless in the fog of war.
Mr. Englund is a Swedish historian and journalist.
He is also the new permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy, which awards the Nobel Prize in Literature.
What he has written here is an unusual book, which he describes, correctly, as "a work of anti-history".
It contains some notable names, important treaties or famous battles; there are virtually no ambassadors, elegant journalists or discussions of tactics or material.
It is not so much a book about what happened, she explains, as "a book about how it happened". It is about "feelings, impressions, experiences and moods".
"The Beauty and the Pain of Battle" combines the wartime experiences of about 20 ordinary men and women, on both sides of the war, from schoolgirls and botanists to rock climbers, doctors, ambulance drivers and administrators.
Some of these people will become heroes.
Some will become prisoners of war, or lose their limbs, go mad or die.
Their lives flickering here like votive candles lit in a church; new ones added to the mix while others are extinguished.
Mr. Englund's book is a deviation from the standard history books.
It's also a corrective to the notion that World War I was just the disastrous trench warfare on the Western Front.
"The Beauty and the Pain of Battle" moves expertly through other theaters of war: the Alps, the Balkans, the Eastern Front, Mesopotamia, East Africa.
The soldiers in this book are being dropped by beehives; one is spending Christmas in Egypt under the pyramids; tsetse flies are an untreatable problem.
This is a moving book, almost from the beginning.
War floods into these people's lives like a natural disaster, like Hurricane Katrina that stinks cordite.
When artillery fire is heard in the distance, and you're a woman who's home with your children, do you stay or run?
Who's coming anyway?
Almost no one understands what's going on, or even why this war has to be fought.
"Lack of facts", notes Mr. Englund, "has been filled with conjecture, assumptions, hopes, fears, fixed ideas, conspiracy theories, dreams, nightmares and rumors".
"The Beauty and the Pain of Battle" follows individuals such as Florence Farmborough, an English nurse in the Russian army, and Richard Stumpf, a young German sailor in the High Seas Fleet.
Her stories have been drawn mostly from memoirs, letters and other previously published material.
The explanations of their lives can be frightening or moving, but they are most alive in the accumulation of little moments, lost details, of Mr. Englund.
Many of these are about deprivation and making do with what is.
About telling the story of a German schoolgirl, she says: "Succendancy, everywhere succendancy".
"Coffee seat, fake aluminum, fake rubber, paper bandages, wooden buttons. " I'm not sure what you mean.
He keeps talking about the substitute food in Germany.
It describes "meat made from cooked rice pressed into ram fat (and topped with a fake bone made of wood); tobacco made from dry potato roots and peels; shoes with wooden soles".
There are, he notes, "837 permitted meat substitutes in sausage production, 511 registered coffee substitutes".
Some stories are about honor and courage.
An American acknowledges his own impulse toward savagery and states about the war: "You feel that, after all, this is what men are meant for and not to sit in armchairs with a cigar and a whiskey, the afternoon paper or a best seller, and pretend that varnish means civilization and that there is no barbarian behind that starchy, speckled pectoral".
A British soldier, on the other hand, realizes that he'll probably die, and that no one will know or care.
"Once one resigns to the thought of sacrificing oneself, one would like to think that it could happen in front of an audience", he writes.
Instead, it is horribly like "a condemned man being strangled in secret".
Other observations are about an old Europe disappearing, and about new kinds of terror.
"The conflict has become more and more an economic competition", writes Mr. Englund, "a war between factories".
It reflects the arrival of what he calls "a new species in the bestiary of the young century: The eloquent, ideologically convinced mass murderer in fine clothes who executes his butchery while sitting behind a desk".
People behave in unpredictable ways; there is both innoble and heroic behavior.
Mr. Englund is talking about soldiers who actively tried to catch venereal disease from prostitutes as a way to evade front-line service.
"The most grotesque expression of this can be seen in the trade in gonococcal pus, which soldiers buy and smear on their genitals in the hope of ending up in the hospital", he writes.
"Those who are truly desperate rub it over their eyes, often resulting in lifelong blindness".
In this Swedish translation by Peter Graves, Mr. Englund's agile but not extravagant prose is perfectly suited to his human task.
In dozens of small scenes he reflects on the way in which the war has "unleashed exceptionally uncontrollable forces: extreme nationalism, social revolution, religious hatred".
People are starting to wonder why their leaders are making them fight.
The best books about World War I have often been indirect, like The Great War and Paul Fussell's Modern Memoir, or novels like No News at the Front by Erich Maria Remarque, rather than integral histories.
Mr. Englund's volume is joined to an unconventional pantheon.
Your book has one of the most devastating endings I can remember in a work of nonfiction.
I won't tell.
But it's as if he'd come from his book, ripped that page of dramatis personae from between your fingers, and burned it with a match.
After a previous misstep, a planned assault to the minute
Hundreds of police officers were involved, some of them wearing riot helmets.
Monday-Tuesday night was chosen because Zuccotti Park would be emptier.
The operation was kept secret except for a few high-ranking officers, initially telling the others they were joining an exercise.
Police Inspector Raymond W. Kelly was at the center, his presence underscoring how the operation was plagued with challenges for the police department.
The episodes of recent weeks, such as the spraying of pepper spray on protesters, breaking department rules and creating a storm of public sympathy towards the "okupas" could not be repeated.
And so the police operation to clear Zuccotti Park of protesters was revealed after two weeks of planning and training.
The agents had prepared themselves by seeing how the occupations had developed in other cities.
A larger catastrophe drill was taking place on Randalls Island, with an eye on Zuccotti.
The agents increased so-called riot training - counterterrorism measures that involved rapidly mobilizing a large number of police officers - to focus on Lower Manhattan.
The last training session was Monday night on the Manhattan side of the East River.
Orders to enter the park came at the "last minute", said someone familiar with the orders, which referred to the mission only as "an exercise".
"The few cops I know who were called for this, they were not told that it was to enter Zuccotti Park", said the person, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
"The only people who knew they were going to enter Zuccotti Park were at the highest levels of the department".
One reason for the secrecy was a lesson learned by the city.
On October 14, officers wanted to clear the park, but gave up when hundreds of protesters showed up early after hearing about the plans.
Tuesday's operation involved officers from several police units, including special forces from across the municipal district - dozens of mobile officers who routinely flood neighborhoods with high crime rates.
Mr. Kelly said that a lot of people, like those who commute daily to work, had been coming and going from the park during the day, making 1 a.m. a good time to get in.
"It was appropriate to do it when there were the fewest people in the park", he said.
Emergency Services Unit trucks with headlights and loudspeakers were converging at the intersection of Pike Slip and Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive, near the Manhattan Bridge, before leaving.
The lights and pre-recorded messages that were blaring from the speakers seemed to intimidate many protesters.
Community affairs officers went to the park with their light blue windbreaks, many protesters simply picked up their things and left.
No stores were touched until 1:45 a.m., police said, giving protesters time to collect their belongings.
Other teams of agents were seen gathering at the perimeter to enter if necessary to make arrests in the park.
The journalists in the park were forced to leave.
Paul J. Browne, the chief spokesman for the Police Department, said it was for their safety.
But many journalists said that they tried to prevent the police from seeing action in the park, and that they had been treated rudely by the officers.
Mr. Browne said that mobile television units on Church Street, along the western edge of the park, were able to capture images.
As police moved westward through the dense tangle of protesters' personal effects, including luggage and paper and plastic garbage bags crammed with clothing, teams from the Cleanup Department followed, picking up what was left behind.
Some protesters who refused to move were dragged outside, images appearing on the Internet shortly after.
A central group of protesters took up positions near the camp's kitchen area, near the center of the park.
Some people made a barrier, and the police came in to arrest them methodically.
About 10 people in the center of the camp were clinging to each other by the arms.
And two people chained to trees, Mr. Kelly said.
Emergency service agents were called in to cut the locks.
No arrests were made in the park until about 3:30 a.m., Mr. Kelly said.
The cleanup operation was complete about 75 minutes later, police said.
Mr. Browne said that about 142 people were arrested in the park.
Most of the arrests were for "disturbance of public order and resistance to authority", he said.
The highest-ranking officer on the scene was Joseph J. Espósito, the department head, the senior uniformed officer in the department.
Phil T. Pulaski, the department's chief of detectives, was also there.
Mr. Kelly, while present, "was not directing the operations", Mr. Browne said.
A second group of agents was waiting along the east side of Broadway, between Liberty and Cedar streets, in case they had to come in.
Barricades were erected on Cortlandt Street, a block north of the park, and Pine Street, a block south.
From those positions, the police were seen expanding the perimeter even beyond Zuccotti Park.
At one point, a number of agents, many of them with shields, were seen pushing people out.
There were about 28 people on the northern perimeter.
Some of the night's loudest action took place south of the park.
At around 5 a.m., south of Pine Street, a protester jumped on the hood of a police car, and others were seen removing air from the wheels of a police van.
At one point, a piece of plywood came flying out of the crowd.
In the end, an officer and a protester were hospitalized.
The support workers union will sue the city for the layoffs
The union representing hundreds of school support workers who lost their jobs last month plans to sue the city on Wednesday, claiming the firings were unnecessary and discriminatory because of their disproportionate impact on schools that serve poor students.
The lawsuit is possibly the last weapon at the disposal of the union, Municipal District 37, in their effort to overturn the layoffs.
Six hundred and seventy-two school aides, parent coordinators and other employees who were among the city's lowest paid lost their jobs on October 7, in a move union leaders have described as political revenge for their refusal last spring to allow the city access to a health care fund run by task forces to close its budget gap.
The city authorities have categorically denied this accusation.
At a City Hall hearing last month, Education Councilor Dennis M. Walcott said the layoffs were part of a budget passed in June.
A board member countered by telling him that nothing in the budget specified that school support staff members would be fired.
Officials from the 37th municipal district said they filed the complaint in writing, warning the Department of Education that it would be sued.
The lawsuit will include Mr. Walcott and the city's Department of Education as defendants, and it has eight dismissed workers as plaintiffs, all of them black or Latino women, as well as most of the attendees who lost their jobs.
Elizabeth Thomas, spokeswoman for the city's Legal Department, said the city had not seen the lawsuit and therefore could not comment on its specific allegations.
According to a draft of the lawsuit obtained by The New York Times, the union has focused on the number of layoffs in schools in poor areas of the city to support an unfair treatment claim, saying that poor schools lost more attendants because they had been chronically underfunded.
It is noted that while there were no layoffs in Staten Island and a few layoffs in schools on the Upper East Side or TriBeCa, 17 school assistants lost their jobs in District 23 in Brownsville, Brooklyn, and 46 were laid off in Districts 8 and 9 in the South Bronx.
Considering the loss of five of the eight assistants employed by Public School 36 in Harlem, where 68 percent of students live in poverty, the lawsuit says, "This is not a neighborhood of wealthy parents who can raise funds to cover the budget deficit".
P.S. The district 36 budget was cut by 3.26 percent this year, and it also lost money when the city changed the way it calculates additional funding for each enrollment per poor student in the schools.
The union also claims that high school principals may have been misled by the language in a memorandum authorizing the firing of parent coordinators.
The memorandum used the word "surplus" to describe the action, although "surplus" more often describes the act of transferring a teacher from a school payroll to a job board, whose salaries are paid by the central office.
"Sixty-six parent coordinators were fired", the complaint draft says, "and not just in excess".
Mission accomplished, Congress ready to reach agreement on Libya
It seems that Republicans and Democrats on Capitol Hill are finally willing to agree on something related to the Libyan uprising.
All that was needed was for the rebellion to succeed, for the veteran dictator Muammar Gaddafi to be captured and killed and for US involvement to come to an end.
On Tuesday, the Senate Foreign Affairs Committee is considering a resolution, sponsored by President John Kerry (D-Massachusetts), along with Senators John McCain (R-Arizona) and Joseph I. Lieberman (Connecticut Independent), applauding the Libyans for their successful rebellion and the U.S. troops for their "bravery".
"This resolution is to honor the brave men of Libya as they begin to rebuild their country", Kerry said.
"It's an affirmation of bipartisan support for their democratic aspirations".
The language may seem harmless, but nothing about the debate on Libya has been easy so far.
This summer, lawmakers from both parties were fighting with each other and the White House over the drafting of a series of resolutions to approve or reject the role of the US military in the NATO mission in Libya.
In June, Kerry and McCain introduced a resolution authorizing the limited use of U.S. military forces in Libya.
The bill was defeated in the House by a wide bipartisan margin, and it never got to a vote in the Senate.
But the same day the bill was defeated in the House, the House also rejected a measure that would have cut funding for U.S. operations in Libya.
That left the US mission in a sort of legislative purgatory - with Congress upset enough to criticize Obama's handling of the mission, but not so angry as to actually mow the grass under its feet.
Then the Congress' indecision was overcome by events.
Tripoli fell to Libyan rebels in August, and Gaddafi was killed on October 20.
The NATO mission officially ended on October 31.
Now the Senate might be ready to act.
The Foreign Affairs Committee resolution "commends the people of Libya for their tremendous courage and extraordinary resilience to free themselves" and "commends the men and women of the United States Armed Forces and their coalition partners who participated in military operations to protect the people of Libya for their extraordinary courage and professionalism".
The resolution also "declares the national interest of the United States in a successful and irreversible transition to democracy in Libya".
Will the new measure win the full support of the Foreign Affairs committee, or will it divide lawmakers as did the June bill?
The latter version was rejected by Sen. Richard G. Lugar (Indiana), the committee's leading Republican.
Lugar's spokesman said Monday that he had not yet seen the final version of the new bill.
Across the Capitol, the House is voting this week on a constitutional amendment demanding a balanced budget, a legislative priority for nearly all Republicans and some Democrats.
The measure, sponsored by Republican Bob Goodlatte (R-V), will be the first constitutional amendment on the budget or any other issue that actually achieves a full-house vote in either the House or the Senate in this Congress.
Other legislators have not succeeded so far in getting their amendments through the assembly, but not for lack of trying.
Goodlatte's is just one of 68 constitutional amendments that have been introduced in this Congress, covering a wide range of issues.
Some are duplicated - the same bill is proposed in both the House and Senate - and others with slight variations from each other.
There are at least 15 versions of the balanced budget amendment in the House alone, and a handful more that will "control federal spending".
Some of those bills are also identical to each other, but they give their sponsors - especially new Republicans seeking to refine their resumes - the opportunity to boast that they were the "authors" of the measure.
The Budget Control Act, which was passed in August, required that both the House and Senate vote on an amendment to the budget balance.
In March, 58 senators voted in favour of a non-binding resolution supporting the idea of such an amendment.
Beyond the budget, several members want to limit the number of terms that members of Congress can serve, while Rep. Jose E. Serrano (D-NY), wants to remove the two-term limit for presidents.
Rep. Jesse L. Jackson Jr. (D-Ill.) has proposed a series of amendments guaranteeing the right to quality education and health care, among other issues.
An amendment banning gay marriage is a perennial proposal, as is one banning flag burning.
Some lawmakers also want to allow the overriding of federal laws if they are rejected by two-thirds of the states.
As enthusiastic as the members have been in proposing amendments, they are not moving at a faster pace than in previous years.
In the 111th Congress, legislators proposed 77 amendments, and introduced 66 in the 110th.
The pace is unacceptable compared to the 1990s, when members regularly filed more than 150 amendments every two years, according to figures provided by the Library of the Senate.
But they weren't much more successful then than they are now.
The last amendment that was added - the 27th - was ratified in 1992, but it was actually proposed by Congress in 1789.
"Beaten but not defeated", Giffords speaks in her first TV interview since the shooting.
Ten months after a gunman shot her at point-blank range at a constitutional rally in Tucson, Arizona, Rep. Gabrielle Giffords (D-Ariz.) appeared on national television Monday night, sang along to the Broadway tune "The Sun Will Rise Tomorrow" and said she wanted to recover more than she wanted to return to Congress.
In her ABC News appearance "20/20", with Diane Sawyer, Giffords struggled to form sentences and needed help walking.
The program documented his difficult journey back from the damage caused by a bullet that fractured his skull and pierced the left side of his brain, and that passed from the front to the back of his head.
Three months ago, he surprised the House by casting his triumphant vote on the debt ceiling deal.
In her first television interview since the January shooting, which killed six and injured 13, Giffords smiled, laughed and sang - and described her recovery as "difficult".
When Sawyer asked how she was feeling, Giffords, 41, replied: "Rather well".
The interview with Giffords and her husband, astronaut Mark Kelly, was part of an hour-long "20/20" special, which aired on the eve of the publication of the couple's new book, "Gabby: A Story of Courage and Hope".
The special was looking at Giffords' recovery from the January 8 shooting.
In videos recorded by Kelly in the first few weeks, she is seen in her hospital bed, with a shaved head and a long scar running across her forehead.
She can only hold up one or two fingers while her husband cheers her on.
Months later, Giffords is seen sitting in a wheelchair as therapists teach her how to perform simple actions.
A head movement.
A frown of the lips.
And then, his first word, "What".
Within days, Giffords uttered another word - "toast", a request for a change to her breakfast menu.
Videos released by ABC show that music played a central role in Giffords' recovery: The congresswoman is seen singing along with therapists Cyndi Lauper's "Girls Just Wanna Have Fun" and Tom Petty's "Free Falling".
In the interview with Sawyer, Giffords, who does two hours of therapy every day, said she doesn't remember the day of the shooting.
Her husband said he was reading to Giffords a newspaper article about the March 12 murder when she stopped him to ask for the first time about the six who had died in the incident.
The suspected gunman, Jared Lee Loughner, is being held in a Missouri prison and is being force-fed medication while awaiting trial.
"A lot of people died", Giffords told Sawyer.
"Hard, hard, hard" is what I'm saying.
Kelly told Sawyer that in a moment of his wife's recovery, she said, "I've been defeated".
"So, I said, 'Gabby, you haven't been beaten,'" Kelly said.
"You've just been hit.
And you're going to get through this, and you're going to get better, and you're going to come back stronger than you ever have".
The troops make me feel more pity than respect
The event was a Wall Street gala that raised millions of dollars for homeless veterans in New York.
Kid Rock sang a ballad about impotence and frustration and loss.
At that moment, several hundred soldiers, sailors, airmen and Marines stormed into their posts around him.
The tag crowd stood up and applauded.
"Men and women were seen as heroes", said David Saltzman, who organized the spring fundraiser.
A senior military officer at the gala, also known as the then chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Admiral Mike Mullen, saw the role of the troops differently.
"They were shown as a kind of orphaned child", the officer wrote in an email.
I'm sure the organizers had good intentions.
I know they had them.
But it wasn't respect, really.
The starkly contradictory impressions illustrate the difficult relationship that has taken hold of the military and an often distant, sometimes adoring, American public.
He lavishes praise on the troops for their sacrifices.
But praise comes at a price, say service members.
The public is increasingly acting as if they feel sorry for those in uniform.
"We are not victims at all", said Brigadier General Sean B. MacFarland, who commanded troops in Iraq and will soon leave for Afghanistan.
"But it seems the only way some people show their support is to put us in the role of helpless souls".
The issue is a very sensitive one for military leaders, who don't want to appear ungrateful or at odds with the public they serve.
They also realize that the anger that the troops faced when they came back in the last years of the Vietnam War was much worse.
As a result, most conversations about pity take place quietly and privately among veterans.
After his two sons returned from combat with the Marines, retired Colonel Mark Cancian warned them that people other than the military would view their service from two perspectives.
Some would look at them with a sense of awe because they faced insurgents and traveled to exotic places.
Others would wonder if there was an "angry, violent veteran under the surface", said Cancian, who fought in Iraq and returned to a high-level government job in Washington.
During his job search, he said, he felt that some interviewers had subtly asked him if he would be able to stand under the pressure of a demanding Washington job immediately after his combat tour.
"When you talk about your service, you need to deal with negative impressions", Cancian told his children.
Military restlessness arises, in part, from American indifference to war.
Battlefield achievements are rarely singled out for praise by a country that has little familiarity with the military and sees little direct benefit from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.
"We, as a nation, no longer value military heroism in ways that were quite common in World War II", said retired Lieutenant General David Barno, who commanded U.S. troops in Afghanistan.
Instead, praise from politicians and the public focuses largely on the depth of a service member's suffering.
Troops are recognized by the number of tours they have endured, the number of friends they have lost or the extent of their injuries.
Army faces growing pressure to end rape
This week, a historic hearing will decide whether 28 women and men have a case against the military for its alleged inaction in the rape.
If not, hundreds of plaintiffs are organizing for the next one.
First Sergeant Elizabeth Lyman was 25 years old and 11 weeks pregnant the night she says she was raped by a fellow soldier.
It was October 2008, and he was on his way back to his headquarters at Miramar Air Base, just north of San Diego, after dinner with a friend when he ran into a colleague who was carrying a 12-pack of beer.
He asked if he could join her in her room for a drink.
"It sounded an alarm", says Lyman.
However, the Texas native put her concern aside.
I thought, no, he's 19.
"He's from Texas", he says.
"I wish I'd listened to my instincts".
Within minutes of entering Lyman's room, the man approached her from behind, pulling her down and raping her, she alleges.
This week, on November 18th, Lyman and 27 other current and former military personnel are anxiously awaiting a court decision in a landmark trial to be held in Arlington, Virginia, that will decide whether or not the lawsuit they have filed against former Defense Secretary Robert Gates and his predecessor, Donald Rumsfeld, will go to trial.
The lawsuit alleges that Gates and Rumsfeld failed to reduce widespread rape among the military, in violation of the soldiers' constitutional rights.
Filed in February by Susan Burke, a Washington, D.C. attorney, the lawsuit initially involved 17 plaintiffs, but grew to 28 in the following months, 25 women and three men, all of whom claim they were raped or sexually assaulted by their partners, and that the military failed to investigate, prosecute, or provide adequate justice after the alleged assaults.
Burke says he's going after the army's general staff, because the problem starts with them.
"The army is a top-down structure", he says.
"Who are the people who are in a position to eradicate the culture of retaliation? The high command".
Burke also says that since February, she's been contacted by about 400 more survivors, many of whom could be part of future lawsuits.
His strategy: Instead of accumulating all the plaintiffs in this case, putting all the eggs in one basket, so to speak, he's going to file multiple cases, if necessary, to keep the pressure on.
The defense team for the Department of Defense, led by federal prosecutor Neil MacBride, has filed a motion to dismiss the case.
Court documents, obtained by Newsweek, detail the defense strategy - essentially, that the military cannot be sued by current or former soldiers for injuries sustained in the armed forces.
By a 1950 Supreme Court ruling called the Feres Doctrine, the federal government is not liable for damages suffered by active duty personnel.
"The alleged damages are part of the military service of the plaintiffs", the documents say.
The Department of Defense declined to comment for this article.
Things have changed since the 1950s.
While women are still officially barred from serving in combat, this distinction is only nominal: Modern wars rarely have clear front lines.
In both Iraq and Afghanistan, female soldier teams are playing increasingly important roles, especially in reaching out to local women in war zones.
The result: between those two wars, 150 female soldiers have died, and two-thirds of them in combat situations.
It's time for the military to modernize too, says Burke.
She's not alone in her fight, and three other lawsuits are underway, in addition to hers.
At Yale Law School, the Veterans Legal Services Clinic is preparing a case against the four major military academies for allegedly promoting a misogynist environment.
On the other hand, the nonprofit organization Vietnam Veterans of America is drafting a lawsuit against the military that focuses on the "personality disorder" diagnoses assigned to rape victims in order to discharge them from service - a common occurrence, according to activists, such as Anu Bhagwati of the Women in Service Action Network, a human rights group.
His group filed a lawsuit in December against the Veterans Administration, accusing it of discriminatory practices in the way it handles benefits claims for people who say they were sexually assaulted in the service.
Nine separate bills have been introduced in Congress by a bipartisan mix of senators and representatives, proposing a series of corrections.
In 2010 there were 3,158 reported sexual assaults, according to the Department of Defense's Office for Sexual Assault Prevention and Response.
However, the attacks are notably underreported, and by the Pentagon's own estimates, account for about 13.5 percent of the estimated 19,000 incidents that occurred that year.
The report, published in March, also examines prosecution rates: in 2010, 20 percent of cases reported to the military went to trial - half that in the civil justice system.
The plaintiffs in Burke's case, they describe his attacks as just the first in a series of traumas.
In Lyman's case, he reported the alleged rape to the military police less than an hour after it occurred.
That night, she says, she was asked to tell the details of her rape 11 different times to a crowd of police officers, doctors, and commanders.
She underwent a rape kit, and her assailant's blood - from a cut on her arm - was found on her bed.
Six months later, in April 2009, Lyman attended a court hearing before a judge, during which she was asked about having sex with her boyfriend on the day of the attack.
Six people testified as character witnesses on behalf of the alleged perpetrator, who was eventually acquitted.
"I remember the day the verdict was read", says Lyman.
"I thought I was going to work - I found myself screaming from the living room".
"They put me in the psychiatric unit, and when I left, I remember saying to my commanding officer, 'That wasn't your judgment. That was my judgment.'
Lyman was ordered to visit a military psychiatrist, who eventually diagnosed her with a personality disorder, which made her unfit for service.
In January 2010 she was dismissed from the service on less-than-honorable terms, which prevented her from receiving any benefits.
As to whether the case brought by Lyman and his fellow plaintiffs continues, it is a very remote possibility, says John Turley, a law professor at George Washington Law School.
However, he notes, "In my opinion, they should be able to move on".
What stands between them and a verdict is this doctrine that has been criticized since it was first published.
I've been a lifelong critic of the Feres Doctrine.
The military is decades behind because it doesn't have the same incentive and deterrence that accountability poses.
He adds: "The odds are strongly against them... but it is important for them to try".
These things only change when good people are willing to fight.
If the hearing doesn't go your way, Burke, the plaintiffs' attorney, will be lining up her other hundreds of plaintiffs for future cases.
"We are going to continue fighting the army on this issue until reform comes", he says.
"Or until we die, whichever comes first.
Walls Have Eyes: How Researchers are Studying You on Facebook
Before becoming the new face of the far right in Europe, Anders Behring Breivik was just another guy airing his anti-immigration views online.
On Monday, Breivik, who admitted to carrying out a massacre in Norway in July that left 77 dead, faced his first public court hearing.
While Breivik may have acted alone, he was far from alone in cyberspace: He had spent most of the time before his attack in front of his computer, chatting with some of the millions of nationalists who support right-wing groups on social media.
After the tragedy this summer, researchers wanted to know more about these people.
But how to find them?
Easy - you just have to log in to Facebook.
"We realized that it wasn't that hard to reach them", says Jamie Bartlett, lead author of a recently published report on European digital populism by the British think tank DEMOS.
Facebook's personal information cache is so encyclopedic, says Bartlett, that researchers could simply use the advertising tool to determine their desired demographic characteristics with scientific accuracy - the way marketers have been using it for years.
Bartlett's team found half a million fans of right-wing groups across Europe and then ran ads for them, but instead of linking them to a new band or diet product, the ads invited users to complete a survey that asked about their educational level, attitudes toward violence and optimism about their own future.
By reaching out via Facebook, Bartlett and his colleagues were able to study over 10,000 supporters of 14 far-right parties in 11 European countries - all without leaving the office.
"It's a whole new way of doing research", says Bartlett.
Some of the results are not entirely surprising: Online supporters of right-wing groups tend to be young, male and angry about immigration.
However, in a kind of twist, "those who combine their online activism with offline activism are more reasonable, more democratic and less violent than those who stay behind the computer screen".
The work of DEMOS is just one example of how Facebook is becoming a new and important tool in the hands of scientists.
Research institutes, medical researchers and political scientists are using the site to study everything from health issues to social trends as expressed in likes, messages on walls and status updates.
With over 800 million active users adding an average of three pieces of content a day, Facebook's "data supernova" is generating a research boom, boosting the number of academic papers with the site's name in the title by almost 800% in the last five years.
To some researchers, the beauty of Facebook is that it allows you to study people you couldn't reach with a briefcase on the street.
"Before, when you tried to poll people from the British National Party, it was very difficult to identify them".
"You would have to go through the party, and they would never allow you access", Bartlett says.
"Facebook removes all that - you go directly to them".
Others say the site could provide a way to identify and address health-social issues.
A recent study by Dr. Megan Moreno of the University of Wisconsin-Madison and her colleagues found that college students who talked about their drunken exploits on Facebook were significantly more likely to have problems with drinking than students who remained silent about the issue.
Moreno suggests that fellow students, such as residential counselors, could monitor the site and intervene to help a student who posts too many status updates with his or her drinking.
"You can't treat a problem if you can't diagnose it", said Dimitri Christakis, Moreno's co-author and director of the Center for Child Health, Behavior and Development at the Seattle Children's Research Institute, the Washington Post reported.
"We have found a way to identify children at risk who would otherwise go undiagnosed".
Facebook is also constantly "pinning" its own population for data.
The site's Data Team has compiled statistics on the status of the relationship and Valentine's Day, the expected voter turnout in the 2010 midterm elections, and a National Happiness Index (primarily using the information that is accessible - digital freedom advocates have long argued that the site should make its wealth of data available to others for research).
However, Facebook users know that the site is watching them whether they like it or not - the sacrifice of being able to play Scrabble with a friend thousands of miles away is allowing the site to mine your personal information.
But what happens when Facebook users get to participate in a survey that they don't even know about?
While researchers have well-defined guidelines on how to collect their data offline, online is a free-for-all.
"I don't think many users have even thought about the fact that a researcher might be looking at their profiles", says Neil Selwyn, a sociologist at the London Knowledge Lab, about a 2006 study he conducted with students' public Facebook walls.
"As far as they were concerned, it was just between them and their friends".
Then there is the question of methodology.
Even offline, there's no guarantee that a research subject is being completely honest.
On Facebook, it's impossible to know what part of a user's profile information and wall posts are true.
"What you say on Facebook and what you do off Facebook are two completely different things", says Selwyn.
That's why, despite his years as a technology researcher, Selwyn believes that a paperweight and a fountain pen are still the best research tools anyone can use.
"There's no substitute for going out into the real world and talking to real people", he says.
"Social research is supposed to be about the social - and a lot of the social still happens offline".
"Cold and Inhuman: Anders Behring Breivik makes his first public court appearance
Anders Behring Breivik, the man who confessed to masterminding the two attacks that killed 77 people in Norway this summer, has described himself as a "resistance" fighter during his first public appearance at the Oslo court.
"I am a military commander in the Norwegian resistance movement and in the Knights Templar of Norway", he told a room full of 500 people.
"I object to the court because it was mandated by organizations that support the ideology of hate and because it supports multiculturalism".
"I acknowledge the facts but I do not plead guilty".
Judge Torkjel Nesheim interrupted Breivik during that monologue, because "he did not want to give Breivik the opportunity to use this audience as a platform for him to express his views".
For the same reason he refused to allow Breivik, who brought a speech written in advance, to address the relatives of his victims at the end of the hearing.
Nesheim also ordered police to keep Breivik in custody for 12 more weeks, banned him from media access for four weeks, and said that authorities would have to have a strict control over all visits and correspondence for eight weeks.
About 30 survivors and relatives of the victims attended the hearing.
Some came in hopes of looking Breivik in the eye, others to confirm that he is under lock and key.
Everyone attended with the goal of moving forward to the conclusion.
"I thought it looked cold and inhuman", a survivor from Utoya told Norwegian broadcaster NRK.
"It was uncomfortable, but for me it was a step forward after seeing and hearing the suspect".
Dressed in a dark suit and blue tie, Breivik remained calm and professional throughout the audience and looked reporters and survivors in the eye as he entered and exited the building.
Despite Breivik's strange notion of being part of a larger "resistance" movement, the judge ruled that he is not mentally ill, and said there is no evidence that he acted with accomplices.
Some may take comfort in the fact that the July 22 attacks appear to be the work of an extremist rather than a group of radicals.
But that doesn't automatically ease the pain and confusion that an entire nation still feels.
"I wish I looked like a monster, but I don't", said a relative of one victim.
"It would be so much easier if it looked like it".
7 lessons from Steve Jobs' lost interview, playing in a theater this week
After Steve Jobs' death on October 5, there were some who compared him to Henry Ford - singling out the tech genius as the Great Modern Inventor.
But what Apple fans might find most revealing, in a recently rediscovered interview with Jobs that has been dusted off as a preview of a series of special screenings in major markets this week, is how much this creative mind understood about business processes and product workflows.
He was no doubt a self-proclaimed designer, dreamer and hippie, but he was also a meticulous organizer and a flow-chart junkie - a man who believed that many executives suffered from "a disease that consists of thinking that a great idea is 90 percent of the work... [but] there is an enormous amount of work between a great idea and a great product".
In 1995, Bob Cringely was developing the television series The Triumph of the Nerds about the dawn of the personal computer, and he sat down for over an hour with Jobs for a long, rare conversation.
At the time, it had been barely 10 years since Jobs had been forced out of Apple, and he was already hard at work on his new computer company NeXT, waiting for the popular adoption of the Internet.
While a small portion of Cringely's interview was used in Nerds, he said the originals of the interview disappeared during transport.
It was only after Jobs' death that a complete VHS copy was discovered in the director's garage.
This slightly re-edited archival footage is the basis of Steve Jobs: The Lost Interview, a 68-minute film that comes to Landmark theaters this Wednesday and Thursday.
For someone who is known to hate in-depth interviews, Jobs here seems surprisingly willing to lay out his technological philosophies and business strategies.
And very thoughtful.
At four different points throughout the interview, there are long silences between the questions and the answers -- 10 to 15 seconds of reflection, where Jobs is clearly weighing his thoughts, seeking precision.
There are also moments when Jobs' perfectionism comes to the surface, where he seems impatient because of Cringely's questions, pushing him to move faster toward the issues or arguments of greater importance.
Filmed before the age of Pixar, the iPod or the iPhone, there's something strangely prophetic in The Lost Interview, as Jobs assesses what he sees other companies doing right and wrong, and offers his own vision of the future of computing.
It's one thing to read posthumous evaluations of Jobs' career, but there's something raw and inspiring about the Jobs we see here, the eager dreamer on the brink of greatness.
He has a vision of how things can and should be.
Not long after I explained everything in detail here, he went and did it.
A quick summary of seven notable sequences from The Lost Interview:
About how he learned to run a business:
"Over the years in the business, I always asked, 'Why do you do things?' and the answers you invariably get are, 'Oh, that's just the way it's done.'
Nobody knows why they do what they do, in business nobody thinks things through very deeply.
That's what I found.
Jobs details his efforts to simplify Apple's accounting.
Unconvinced by the way costs were recorded - often starting with a "standard cost" that was hand-made, and then adjusted with a "variable" - he developed an automated factory that ensured that they could determine business costs in detail.
About the Pope joke:
Jobs narrates the "Blue Box" that he built himself with Steve Wozniak - a device that allowed people to effectively hack the phone company and make free long distance calls.
There's been a lot written about the device, but Jobs' euphoria here in describing the Blue Box as an act of empowerment is contagious.
He describes how he and Wozniak tested the box by using a public phone, making a call, and then connecting from one AT&T network to another, while creating a loop with as many satellites as possible.
"We were wrapping things around the world a half dozen times and you'd yell through the public phone and come back a minute later to the public phone next door", Jobs says with a chuckle.
"We were young and what we learned was that we could build something ourselves that could control billions of dollars of infrastructure around the world".
We both didn't know much, but we could build a little thing that could control a giant thing -- it was an incredible lesson, and I don't think Apple would have ever existed without it.
Jobs goes on to describe a glorious prank that he and Wozniak almost abandon, calling the Vatican through the Blue Box in the middle of the night and requesting to speak to the Pope, while doing his best imitation of Henry Kissinger.
As several members of the Catholic hierarchy were summoned in the middle of the night to speak with the American diplomat, the two broke into a fit of laughter just before the pope himself was awakened to go answer the phone.
On falling in love with technology (and telemarketing with Bill Hewlett):
At the age of 12, while hunting for spare parts to build a frequency counter, he looked up Bill Hewlett in the phone book and made a call.
Shortly after their 20-minute phone conversation, Jobs landed a part-time summer job at Hewlett-Packard.
"That was a remarkable influence on me, it was the only company I had seen at that age and it shaped my view of what a company was and how well they treated their employees".
Jobs later became one of the HP employees who visited the company's research labs in Palo Alto, where he saw "the first desktop computer ever made".
It was the size of a suitcase, had a little cathode-ray tube screen, and I fell in love with it.
I'd get a trip to HP as a teenager and hang out with that machine and write programs for it.
On improvising innovation:
At various points in the interview, Jobs talks about inventing new products on the fly.
Early in his career, as he was selling a handful of motherboards, he was asked by a customer if he could assemble the whole set.
Working on only 30 days credit, I had to figure out the assembly and delivery of the finished devices.
Later, while at Apple, he recalled the struggles he faced in developing a computer mouse:
"I remember having dramatic arguments... they were yelling at me that it would take five years [to make a mouse that would cost $300], and I got fed up and went out and found a designer.
Ninety days later, we had a mouse that we could build for 15 dollars and that was totally reliable.
On the big companies losing steam:
Long before he led Apple's renaissance, Jobs prophetically foresaw the way many industry leaders would stumble over their vision, and lose control of their market share.
"Say you work at IBM or Xerox, so you make better copiers and printers, and what?"
You have a monopoly of market share, so the company is no longer successful.
Sales and marketing departments increase success, so it's these kinds of people who end up running companies and the people in charge of the products are thrown out of the decision-making forum.
The product genius that led to that monopoly position is being rotten by people who don't have the notion of good product vs. bad product - the necessary trade knowledge.
That's what happened at Xerox...
Xerox could have taken over the entire computer industry.
It could have been ten times its size, it could have been the Microsoft of the '90s...
They took the defeat of victory.
On innovation as an artistic expression:
"There's an enormous amount of work between a great idea and a great product... as the great idea evolves, changes and grows".
You learn a lot about the subtleties of it.
There are sacrifices you have to make -- some things you can't make that electrons make, glass makes, robots make, factories make.
You have to keep 5,000 things in your brain -- these concepts -- adjust them all at once...
In the end it all comes down to taste -- it comes down to trying to expose you to the best that a team of humans has done, and then trying to adapt those things to what you're doing.
Picasso said that good artists copy, great artists steal.
We've never been ashamed about stealing great ideas.
Part of what made the Macintosh great was that the people who were working on it were musicians, poets, artists, zoologists, historians, who happened to be the best computer scientists in the world.
If it weren't for computer science, I could be doing wonderful things in other fields.
Scalia and Thomas have dinner with health care law rivals while the court accepts the case.
On the day the Supreme Court met behind closed doors to consider the politically controversial question of whether they would accept President Obama's health care law challenge, two of its justices, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, were treated to a dinner sponsored by the law firm that will be presenting the case before the high court.
The occasion was last Thursday, when the nine judges met in a preliminary hearing to thoroughly study the petitions for review.
One of the cases in question was a lawsuit filed by 26 states challenging the comprehensive health care reform passed by Congress last year, a law that has been a rallying cry for conservative activists across the country.
The justices agreed to admit the lawsuit to proceeding and, in fact, a historic 5 and a half hour plea is expected in March, and the result will likely further disrupt the 2012 presidential race, which will be in full swing by the time the court's decision is known.
The lawyer who will appear in court and argue that the law should be thrown out is likely to be Paul Clement, who served as US attorney general during the George W. Bush administration.
Clement's law firm, Bancroft PLLC, was one of nearly two dozen firms that helped sponsor the annual dinner of the Federalist Society, a group that has for many years been dedicated to the defense of conservative legal principles.
Another firm that sponsored the dinner, Jones Day, represents one of the trade associations that challenged the law, the National Federation of Independent Business.
Another sponsor was the pharmaceutical giant Pfizer Inc., which has a huge financial interest in the outcome of the litigation.
The dinner was held at a Washington hotel hours after the court's preliminary hearing on the case.
Among the attendees was, among others, Mitch McConnell, the most prominent Republican in the Senate and an outspoken opponent of the health care bill.
Special guests at the dinner?
It's nothing new: The two judges have been attending Federalist Society events for years.
And it's not something that conflicts with ethical norms.
In fact, judges are exempt from the Code of Conduct that governs the actions of lower federal magistrates.
If they were not, it could be argued that they would fall under the Code Canon 4C, which states: "A judge may attend events to raise funds for law-related and other organizations, although the judge may not be a speaker, a guest of honor, or feature on the program of such an event".
However, the sheer proximity of Scalia and Thomas to two of the law firms in the case, as well as a company with a huge financial interest, was enough to alarm ethics activists in the government.
"This shocking breach of ethics and disregard for the code runs counter to the demands of several magistrates that the court abide by the same rules that apply to all federal judges", said Bob Edgar, the president of Common Cause.
"Judges were booed at a fundraiser gala with lawyers who have cases pending before the court".
Your appearance and attendance at the fundraiser for this event undermines any claim of impartiality, and is unacceptable.
Scalia and Thomas have shown little interest in criticism that they say too easily blends the court's activity with the agenda pushed by groups like the Federalist Society.
And Thomas's wife, Ginni, is a prominent conservative activist.
On the other hand, conservatives argue that it is Magistrate Elena Kagan, not Scalia and Thomas, who has an ethical problem.
Kagan served as the Obama administration's attorney general when the first legal challenges to the law were filed in the lower court.
Her critics have pressed Kagan to withdraw from the case, saying she was too involved in upholding the law to now be impartial.
Kagan has given no indication that he's going to.
Boeing receives a record order of $18 billion.
Emirates airline has ordered 50 Boeing 777 twin-aisle jets, with an option for 20 more.
Boeing also sells six Boeing Dreamliner aircraft to Oman Air, an operation valued at over a billion dollars.
It's rarely news when a company gets an order for 50 units of its product.
But it's a big deal when the company is the aircraft manufacturer Boeing Co. and the sale price for the 50 planes is a record $18 billion.
It's as big as the place where Boeing got the order: the Middle East, a growing gold mine of future airplane orders.
In a study released Monday, the Chicago-based company estimates that over the next 20 years, airlines in the Middle East will need 2,520 planes worth $450 billion.
Boeing announced over the weekend its largest ever order for commercial aircraft in dollar terms - 50 Boeing 777 twin-aisle jets.
The successful order came from Emirates airline in Dubai.
The airline also has an option to buy 20 more aircraft, which would bring the total sale price to $26 billion, Boeing announced at the Dubai Air Show 2011.
Then on Monday, Boeing said that Oman Air had ordered six Boeing 787-8s, the so-called Dreamliner, which boasts fuel economy and spectacular passenger services.
The sale price for six of them is over a billion dollars.
"This clearly has a huge positive effect for Boeing", said Morningstar analyst Neal Dihora.
"The quality of these particular clients is very strong".
Many airlines in the Middle East are owned by their oil-producing nations.
So, not only do they have the money to pay for the planes, but a rise in fuel prices - usually detrimental to airlines, because it's one of the biggest costs - is not so detrimental, because the country is making money from the oil price increase.
That's important because they are less likely than other airlines to cancel or delay flight orders when fuel prices rise, Dihora said.
"They have a natural protection", he said.
The UAE order solidifies Boeing's leadership in the wide-body market and helps keep at bay the attempt by its competitor Airbus SAS to invade its domain with the A350 passenger aircraft.
Boeing's air show victory comes four months after Airbus said it would delay the debut of the larger A350, which competes directly with the 777-300ER.
He delayed the debut to add more momentum after customers demanded an increase in payload and range.
Boeing Co shares were up 1.5% to $67.94.
The sister of the president of Mexico, apparently defeated in the vote of Michoacán
Luisa María Calderón claims that the drug traffickers helped her PRI opponent, Fausto Vallejo, in the governor's race.
President Felipe Calderón's sister appears to have lost her bid to become the governor of Michoacán during the state's violent elections, and she claimed Monday that drug traffickers helped tip the race in favor of one of her opponents.
Preliminary results gave the lead in the race for governor of the western state to Fausto Vallejo, of the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI.
"The intervention of organized crime throughout the electoral process and, above all yesterday, is alarming, not just for Michoacán, but for the entire country", said Luisa María Calderón in a radio interview a day after the Sunday vote.
"They threatened our candidates, our election workers... they seized the ballot boxes, they installed barricades... and ordered the people to vote" in favor of the PRI.
The PRI ruled Mexico for seven decades until it lost the presidency in 2000.
However, it is the staging of a comeback, and the victory in Michoacán is an important step in that effort.
The PRI is hoping to win the presidential elections in July.
Vallejo appears to have narrowly overtaken Calderón, who had led the polls before the election.
Calderón, a candidate of his brother's conservative National Action Party, or PAN, refused to recognize Vallejo as the winner.
Silvano Aureoles, the left-wing candidate for the Democratic Revolution Party, or PRD, who currently holds the governor's office, came in third, a major defeat for the divided and unfortunate left ahead of the 2012 presidential election.
Aureoles also refused to recognize the preliminary results.
Vallejo, the former mayor of the state capital of Morelia, denied any links to drug trafficking and urged the other candidates to accept the results.
Michoacán has long been dominated by drug cartels specializing in marijuana, heroin, and methamphetamines.
It's President Calderon's home state, and he chose Michoacán to launch a military offensive targeting traffickers in December 2006.
Yet the violence has persisted.
A PAN mayor was assassinated a week before the election while campaigning for Luisa María Calderón, and numerous candidates abandoned local candidacies out of fear.
Although for the PRI, as unpleasant as the Michoacán elections may seem, a victory will help boost the party.
The man who is supposed to represent the PRI in the presidential election, Enrique Peña Nieto, speaking from Washington, congratulated Vallejo and said: "I think this victory should be very encouraging, for next year".
The Bank of America urges Asia to help rescue the eurozone
The Asian Development Bank (ADB) has called on India and China to prepare to help rescue the eurozone from its sovereign debt crisis to avoid a long-term recession that would stunt the growth of Asian economies.
Rajat Nag, managing director of the Manila-based Asian Development Bank, said the world's two largest and fastest growing economies had to "do everything possible" to accelerate the economic bloc's recovery either through the International Monetary Fund or directly through bilateral agreements.
He warned against the BRIC [Brazil, Russia, India, China] countries observing Europe's difficulties in an "impartial" way and said that financial assistance from Asia along with European leadership and resources would help avoid a long-term crisis in the global economy.
"We're all in this together".
"So anyone who can help Europe out of the crisis is useful", he told the Financial Times in an interview at the World Economic Forum in Mumbai.
"Asia may be protected to a certain extent, but it cannot be immune".
"So if China and India can help, let it be by all means".
The European monetary union has been severely undermined by a sovereign debt crisis in recent months.
In recent days, Italy's borrowing costs have risen dangerously and the Italian and Greek prime ministers have resigned.
The current sovereign debt crisis in Europe has raised fears that it could push the world economy into recession and has generated calls for the major emerging economies to come together to help the eurozone find a solution.
Mr Nag predicted that any support from Asia would be channeled through the IMF, but said that bilateral assistance - such as the purchase of bonds from the EU's bailout fund, the European Financial Stability Fund - offered greater bargaining power for Europe's Asian partners.
Anand Sharma, India's trade minister, said that "India will do everything possible" to help the eurozone as its own economy was now suffering from falling exports and exhausting inflows of foreign capital.
"No one wants the eurozone to remain unstable and turbulent", he said.
"We have monumental challenges and we have to maintain a high level of growth".
"It's not a choice, it's an imperative, because where do we find employment for tens of millions of our young men and women?"
Others argue that developing economies like India have no responsibility to help rich Europeans when they face their own deep economic problems.
Ashutosh Varshney, a professor at Brown University in the United States, said that it would be politically very difficult to sell aid to Europe for the 1.2 billion people in India, of whom up to 800 million live on about $2 a day or less.
"At some point you will realise that Greeks retire at the age of 50 and go on holiday to the beaches and that will not sit well", he said.
Lee Howell, managing director of the World Economic Forum, also wondered why India's reserves should be used to keep the many well-paid Greek public sector workers in jobs in poorly managed, loss-making companies like the railways.
Mr Nag said the eurozone crisis threatens "important knock-on effects" across Asia.
The Asian Development Bank's forecast of 7.5 percent economic growth in Asia for 2011/12 now faces "downside risks" due to the threat from Europe.
He said vulnerable emerging markets needed to make "contingency plans" to protect themselves from a crisis and significant capital outflows from their economies.
Serious warnings from the Pentagon about possible cuts in defense
Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta warned Congress on Monday that the coming automatic budget cuts could undermine national security and trigger a financial chain reaction from the halls of the Pentagon, to the battlefields of Afghanistan, to the civilian assembly lines.
The Pentagon is already digesting the $450 billion in cuts over the next decade, but now fears an additional $600 billion or more in cuts that may be imminent if Congress fails to reach a spending agreement.
"The impact of these cuts would be devastating to the department", Panetta said in a letter to Senators John McCain, Republican of Arizona, and Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina.
He said that the failure of Congress to reach an agreement on the budget and its consequence, the so-called "kidnapping", would lead to a 23 percent global cut and a halt to many new projects.
"Such a large cut, applied in this indiscriminate way, would render most of our naval and construction projects unenforceable - you cannot buy three-quarters of a ship or a building - and seriously damage other modernization efforts", Panetta wrote to senators.
"We would also be forced to lay off many of our civilian employees involuntarily and because the reduction would be imposed so quickly, it is almost certain that we would have to lay off civilians in order to meet the target".
"These changes would break the faith of those who maintain our army and seriously damage the goodwill".
The cuts would eventually catch up with combat troops, Panetta said.
"While wartime funding in the Overseas Contingency Operations accounts is not directly affected by the hijacking, the war effort would be adversely affected by the severe disruptions in the core budgets", Panetta warned.
"Hiring personnel would be reduced, leading to delays in contracting and contract oversight supporting the war".
"Payroll would be reduced, resulting in delays in payments to wartime suppliers, and legal and political support would be interrupted".
The two senators had written to Panetta 10 days ago, asking for information on the possible impact of automatic cuts at the Defense Department.
"The consequence of a Department of Defense hijacking would be a rapid decline of the United States as the world's leading military power".
"We are firmly against this draconian action", the senators said in a joint statement on Monday afternoon when they published Panetta's letter.
"This is not a result that we can live with, and certainly not one that we should impose on ourselves".
"The kidnapping is a threat to the national security interests of the United States, and must not be allowed to occur".
Whether Panetta's letter and recent warnings from senators will increase pressure for a budget compromise or intensify calls to exempt the Pentagon from the cuts remains to be seen.
Panetta has been increasingly outspoken about the potential cuts, even though he came to a job at the top of the Pentagon with years of experience in budgeting in Congress and the White House and knowing he faced tough decisions.
At a press conference last week, the secretary of defense painted a bleak picture of what might be ahead - an army with a shell, but no core.
"It's a ship without sailors".
"It's a brigade without bullets".
"It's an air wing with insufficient trained pilots".
"It's a paper tiger, an army of barracks, buildings and bombs without enough soldiers trained to carry out the mission", Panetta said in his opening remarks at the Pentagon.
"It is a force that suffers from low morale, poor preparation and is not able to keep up with potential adversaries".
"In effect, it invites to aggression"...
In an appendix to his letters to McCain and Graham, Panetta sets out new details of how the cuts "generate significant operational risks: delay in response time to crises, conflicts and disasters; severely limit our ability to be deployed and previously engaged worldwide; and pose an unacceptable risk in future combat operations".
And Panetta said some of the biggest defense projects could face the axe, including those already being tested and some only in the early planning stages.
That list includes the F35 Joint Strike Fighter fighter plane, a new planned bomber, the next-generation ballistic submarine, the new littoral combat ship, and the new ground combat vehicle the Army and Navy need to replace, the humvee.
Stopping further development and testing of the F35 could generate about $80 billion in savings over 10 years, but its supporters say it's the next vital step to improve and counter potential threats from China and other rivals.
How to Detect a Lie
A glance at the latest headlines shows how serious and pervasive deception and lying are in everyday life.
Republican presidential candidate Herman Cain is busy trading accusations of sexual harassment with several women; each side accusing the other of lying.
The trustees of Penn State University have been charged with perjury for allegedly concealing reports that a retired football coach was sexually assaulting children.
Last week, French President Nicolas Sarkozy was "caught" with an open microphone telling US President Barack Obama that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is a liar.
Lying has destroyed careers and convulsed countries.
New York congressman and Internet exhibitionist Anthony Weiner made a mockery of his denials quickly refuted by irrefutable evidence.
Former presidential candidate John Edwards has been charged with campaign finance violations related to the cover-up of an extramarital affair.
And again, no one who lived through it will ever forget the media circus unleashed by President Bill Clinton by lying during his second term about his sexual relationship with Monica Lewinsky.
Legends about cheating on school and college exams are widespread.
There have been cases where teachers have given test answers to students in order to be better seen in their performance evaluations.
Mentors who should be teaching otherwise are sending the message that lying and cheating are acceptable.
How much deception do we find?
On any given day, studies show that they can lie to you anywhere from 10 to 200 times.
Sure, a lot of those lies are white lies.
Another study showed that strangers lied three times in the first 10 minutes of meeting each other.
Lie detection, or "the locating of lies", is an essential skill that we all need to acquire, for both personal and professional reasons.
Far from being a board game like, say, Charade, where the goal is to exclaim, "I got you", deception detection is a branch of knowledge based on serious scientific data obtained over the past six decades at prestigious universities that carried out in-depth research projects, especially in psychology and physiology.
One of the results of the research is that the old myths about lying have been debunked.
Liars do look in the eyes.
They do not always stutter, stammer, blush, or fidget.
Nor can it be concluded that liars are difficult to detect or expose.
A trained lie detector can get to the truth by learning about statement structure, microfacial expressions, question formation, and timing.
I spent several years sifting through the scientific discoveries about deception in the vast and ever-emerging body of knowledge, and it was clear that deception detection is a modern technique that is easy to learn and helps you navigate our complex world -- especially if your professional responsibilities include hiring, interviewing, or managing negotiations.
Good liars have the ability to read others well, to make them feel comfortable, to manage their own emotions and to intuitively sense how others perceive them.
We know from research that extroverts lie more than introverts, that men tell more "self-oriented lies", while women tell more "other-oriented" lies -- usually to protect someone's feelings -- that married people lie less often to their partners than unmarried people (but the lies they tend to tell tend to be "huge").
We also know that if you are perceived as a wrongdoer, others will feel less guilty about lying to you.
How do you know if someone's lying?
First, observe the subject's usual behavior.
This is called creating a baseline.
It helps to provide reference points for later measurement of changes.
Notice the subject's posture, laughter and vocal characteristics.
You better know if someone normally taps their foot all the time so you don't make unfair accusations when you see their feet tap in the middle of the meeting.
Next, look for groups of deceptive behaviors, verbal and nonverbal.
Consider these groups of behavior as warning signs, not proof of deception.
People who cheat can freeze their upper body trying to remember their story, they can point their feet toward the door, lean toward an exit, change their posture significantly, or exhibit "post-interview discomfort" -- that exaggerated sigh of relief and posture change once all the tough questions are over.
Often interrogators falsely make it appear that the interview is over just to seek that post-interview relief.
It also pays attention to the subject's vocabulary.
Scott Peterson screwed up and used the time that he spent claiming his murdered wife was alive, launching a nationwide manhunt for her.
Cheaters may also use distant language: "I did not have sex with that woman - Miss Lewinsky" or repeat a difficult question in its entirety.
The most common verbal indicators are subtle.
Someone can use a lot of "constraint language" when answering a difficult question: "Well... to tell the truth... as far as I am... to my mind".
This makes the response a perception rather than a fact and is often a warning sign.
There's no magic formula for detecting lies, but developing skills to detect deception is possible.
These skills will improve anyone's chances of avoiding being victimized by the con artists in their professional and personal lives.
The controversial pipeline plan deviated after the threat of US delay in its approval
Days after the Obama administration threatened to delay approval of a planned pipeline from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico -- infuriating labor unions, while appeasing environmentalists -- the company seeking to build the pipeline says it's willing to redirect the project back on track.
TransCanada said Monday night that it will move the planned pipeline out of the ecologically sensitive Sandhills area in Nebraska, and is confident the project will win approval.
The company announced the decision at the press conference at the Nebraska State Capitol.
TransCanada's chief executive, Alex Pourbax, says the company remains confident that the pipeline will eventually be approved, though with a different route.
This comes after the State Department announced last week that they would delay a decision on a federal permit for the project until new potential routes are studied that avoid areas of the Nebraska Sandhills and the Ogallala aquifer, a vast underground water supply.
"This is a real path of progress", Rep. Lee Terry, Republican of Nebraska, told Fox News.
The new environmental review ordered by the State Department is likely to set aside any decision until 2013, after next year's elections, though officials denied that politics were involved in the decision.
Obama, in a written statement last week, described the decision as the State Department's request, and expressed his full support.
The pipeline would run 1,700 kilometers from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico.
It would take 700,000 barrels a day from the province of Alberta to the refineries in Texas.
To do that, I would need to cross six states.
It's hated by environmentalists, but loved by labor groups, who have bet on the estimated 20,000 jobs tied to the pipeline.
But Nebraska lawmakers opposed to the plan are weighing legislation to force a move away from the Sandhills region and the Ogallala aquifer, the largest source of drinking and irrigation water.
The State Department's current environmental impact study found the project only posed limited adverse environmental impacts, but the energy industry source said the department's inspector general has ordered an independent test of the review process, focusing on two issues.
One is whether TransCanada's hired lobbyist, Paul Elliot, who was a campaign adviser to Hillary Clinton in 2008, represents a conflict of interest for the program.
The other is whether a firm that was hired to run the original study was an inappropriate choice because it was linked to TransCanada.
Patti LaBelle sued for allegedly causing a child to vomit in fear.
A New York family claims that disco music diva Patti LaBelle behaved like a madwoman in the lobby of their Manhattan apartment building, scaring their infant daughter to the point that she vomited from fear.
The "Lady Marmalade" singer's rant scared 18-month-old Genevieve Monk so much that she suffered "personality changes, sleep disturbances" and "increased fear of strangers", her family says in Manhattan Superior Court.
It was November 10th last year when the playwright Kevin Monk, his wife, Roseanna, a kindergarten teacher, and Genevieve were preparing to go on a family trip.
While Kevin Monk was getting into the car, Roseanna Monk was going down the lobby of the Riverside Boulevard building, with her luggage, taking Genevieve.
Roseanna Monk said she stood by the door and put her daughter on the floor for a moment.
"Someone came up behind me and said, 'Do you know what your daughter is doing?' I said 'yes' and went to get her", he said.
LaBelle angrily admonished the pregnant woman.
"He said in an aggressive tone, "You shouldn't have left your daughter near the door", said Roseanna Monk.
"I said, 'I have no interest in what you say or think.'
He got mad and started using bad words - the C word and the J word out loud...
He had a bottle of water and started to throw the water from the bottle on me".
He said Genevieve got hysterical.
"I told this woman, 'Look what you did to my daughter,'" said the girl's mother.
LaBelle pounced on her mother - who was still holding Genevieve - and had to be restrained by her surroundings and pulled to a waiting car, said Roseanna Monk.
The little girl was crying so hard that she vomited, he added.
Later, the family sent a note asking for an apology from LaBelle, but got no response.
LaBelle's attorney and representatives did not return calls to comment on what happened.
The lawsuit is seeking unspecified damages, but the family's attorney, Sam Davis, said he took the case for free and that the family plans to donate any money he gets to a charity that supports children with cancer.
"The purpose is to make Patti LaBelle responsible for her conduct", Davis said.
"That kind of behavior is completely unacceptable, especially when you're addressing a kindergarten teacher who is holding an 18-month-old child".
Climate adversity has slowed the economy
During the first year of Mario López Valdez's administration, unemployment and informality have increased in Sinaloa, foreign investment has decreased and the economy has contracted
2011 is a year that will be remembered in the economic history of Sinaloa, it is the first year of the Government of Mario López Valdez, self-styled change, which generated great expectations regarding the advances in the economy, but given the climate adversity of the beginning of the year, no growth is observed, instead it is a deterioration in the main indicators of economic development.
The low temperatures in February, besides causing billionaire losses for the agricultural sector, limited the state economy's chances of growth, caused a contraction in overall economic activity of 3.6 percent in the first half of the year, justified mainly by the historic fall of 31.16 percent in agriculture, which affected the dynamism of the other economic sectors.
According to the report of frost damage, issued by the Mexican Council for Sustainable Rural Development, there were damages in 582 thousand 835 hectares cultivated, of which 78.03 percent suffered total damage and the remaining 21.07 percent had partial damage, the main crops damaged were vegetables, corn and garbanzo.
The fall in economic activity has generated, until November, a steady increase in unemployment in the state, according to the National Institute of Statistics and Geography the rate of state unemployment during the first three quarters of the year was observed an accelerated growth, since while from January to March 55 thousand 053 Sinaloenses were unemployed, with a rate of 4.53 percent of the Economically Active Population, for the second quarter the rate became 5.28 percent, and between July and September the average continued to increase to 6.19 percent, a rate that number of people throws more than 74 thousand Sinaloenses unemployed, an increase compared to the first semester of 18 thousand 969 individuals.
Less liquidity
The unemployment in Sinaloa during the year is multifactorial, for economist Gerardo López Cervantes, director of the Faculty of Economic and Social Sciences of the UAS, the growth of unemployment can be explained indirectly, depending on the actions that since public policy have been carried out.
"What we are seeing is an increase in unemployment that has to do with several factors, including the loss of liquidity in the market due to the effects of a restriction of resources by the legislation that was approved in the congress to combat money laundering, and for people who grab dollars illegally it is not easy for them to work, invest and use them in something", he said.
Migration stopped
López Cervantes noted that the increase in unemployment is also due to a demographic factor.
"The number of people leaving the state in search of work abroad in the United States has been restricted, first because of the difficulties to enter, and second because entering they already have many difficulties to find work, these people are staying and are demanding sources of work here in the state, which makes unemployment rise", he said.
Informal work
The analysis of the Sinaloan labor market is aggravated by considering the high level of informality that predominates among working conditions, according to INEGI, 60.38 percent of the employed population in the state works without being a worker before any social security institution.
In addition to unemployment and informality, another of the labor lags of the state are low wages, the entity has the lowest remunerations in the country, according to the records of the Mexican Institute of Social Security and the Secretariat of Labor and Social Prevention.
The average monthly income of Sinaloan workers was, until September, 5 thousand 352 pesos, well below the national average, located at 7 thousand 375 pesos.
Contraction of FDI
Coupled with the fall in economic activity and the increase in unemployment, during 2011 the largest decrease in Foreign Direct Investment of the last 10 years is recorded, according to the Secretariat of Economy from January to June of the state IED amounted to 630 thousand 697 dollars, which represents a fall of 87.74 percent compared to the 5 million 143 thousand 312 dollars registered during the same period of the previous year.
The Secretariat of Economic Development of the state government, for its part, recorded a total investment of 17 billion 280 million pesos in the year, mainly from companies in the tertiary sector.
The debt
In the face of the economic contraction, the state government requested in July to the state congress the approval of a credit for 3 billion pesos, which would be intended for investment in infrastructure projects in the 18 municipalities, with the purpose of reactivating the economy, the approval of the local congress was for an amount of 2 thousand 600 million pesos, and until November they have not observed the benefits of indebtedness in any sector of the state economy.
Reactions
For representatives of the business sector, the first year of Mario López Valdés' government shows a lack of government management capacity.
Miguel Loredo López, president of the National Chamber of the Transformation Industry, said that in 2011 there was a lack of harmonization of the wills of the different sectors, including the state government itself.
"The performance of the economy in Sinaloa during this year has been really very poor, we have to work hard to recover the ground we lost in this year, in 2012 we have to redouble efforts, failed to align the effort of all and especially the good and synchronized march of this new team of Government, we hope that the next year is much better", he said.
Economic slowdown
Loredo López said events such as the frosts earlier this year halted the state economy and restricted its performance and growth.
"The low economic flow is the result of several events, including frosts, one of the main effects has been a slow economy that does not turn fast enough to generate an economic dynamism that allows to have an acceptable level of flow in the processes, products and services and therefore, at the end of the year we are closing much below the expectations we had", he said.
Redefining the vocation
For Teodoro Salazar Uriarte, president of the Confederation of Patrons of the Mexican Republic in Sinaloa, said that it is necessary to move the state towards more dynamic productive activities.
"In general, we have observed that it has been working, we believe that it is necessary to develop a long-term program in which the vocation and the economic course of the state is redefined, because it is important that all the potential of the material and human resource that Sinaloa has is detonated", he said.
Work to be done
The President of Coparmex stressed the importance of establishing a vision for the future that would better guide the efforts of the Government.
"In general I would say that the government has been striving to give good results in different matters, in the matter of economic development there are some advances but it is important that a long-term program is developed", he said.
He noted that the current administration has shown progress in its way of conducting public policy.
"There are elements that allow us to say that the government is being more inclusive, what I can say is that there is work done and I think that the government is aware that there is work to be done", he said.
He's convicted of eight kilos of marijuana
A neighbor of Navolato was sentenced to five years in prison and 100 days in a fine for possession of eight kilos of marijuana.
The Prosecutor General of the Republic reported that the sentenced narcomenudista is Omar Alexis Valenzuela Sandoval, for the crime against health, in his variant of possession of marijuana for commercial purposes.
According to the AP/SIN/CLN/687/2010/M-I file, Valenzuela Sandoval was arrested by elements of the Mexican Army, on June 7, 2010, in a surveillance operation on Cipriano Valdez Street, in front of post 80, in the town of El Castillo, Navolato.
The narcomenundista was driving a white pickup truck, where he had a black bag in the trunk of the vehicle and in the passenger seat a small backpack, where the military found eight kilograms of marijuana.
For these reasons, the insured person was at the disposal of the Second District Judge and the sentenced person remains interned in the Center for the Execution of the Legal Consequences of the Crime.
Debt contributions for works
The social works included in programs such as Habitat, Rescue of Public Spaces and 3x1 for migrants are at risk of not being completed or of having serious delays due to the lack of economic resources, said Miguel Ángel López Miranda.
The director of the municipal Social Development said that although the work programs have advanced so far, they are at risk because the State Government has not met the contributions that correspond to it, which add up to a resource greater than 11 million pesos in the three programs.
He pointed out that in total the investment in these three programs is almost 50 million pesos, of which the State accounts for 25 percent and that until now only the Federation and the Municipality have contributed resources for the works, so the possible delay in the conclusion of these becomes effective.
"They have to contribute almost 12 million and despite the fact that the year is about to end they have not given us even a fifth, when since July they should have given us a part", he said, "to not be late we have started the works and they are very advanced, but we need the money".
He mentioned that last year, during the administration of Jesús Aguilar Padilla, the State did not meet the contributions that corresponded to them, so at the beginning of the administration the Municipality had to request a credit to cover the more than 7 million that the state administration did not contribute on that occasion.
"It happened to us in the previous six years because the state did not have the economic capacity to participate and the programs continued to run, and this year we to access these programs had to get the resources to cover what the state left pending", he said.
Although the state authorities are committed to delivering these resources, he said that the Secretary of Administration and Finance, Armando Villarreal, has been asked to expedite the procedures so that the percentages that correspond to them reach as soon as possible.
"It's almost 12 million that they have to contribute and even though the year is about to end they haven't given us even a fifth".
Analog blackout in Mexico in 2015 is valid
The replacement of analogue signals by digital is one of the most important changes the world has undergone in recent years.
The Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation (SCJN) dismissed the constitutional controversies that the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies brought against the presidential decree that advances the so-called "analogic shutdown" from 2021 to 2015, by not gathering the eight votes necessary to invalidate it.
A minority of four ministers, including the president of the Court, Juan Silva Meza, considered that President Felipe Calderón did not exceed his duties by issuing the decree detailing the actions to be taken to implement the transition to digital terrestrial television.
With that result, the constitutional controversy promoted by the Senate of the Republic was dismissed for not reaching the qualified majority of eight votes for the Court to pronounce on the constitutionality or unconstitutionality of the decree, and this remains in force.
The draft sentence, drafted by Minister Olga Sánchez Cordero, proposed declaring the decree unconstitutional, because the regulation of radio and television matters is a faculty reserved by law to the Federal Telecommunications Commission (Cofetel), in contravention of the principles of hierarchical subordination and reserve of law.
Only Zaldívar, Jorge Mario Pardo, Margarita Luna and Sánchez Cordero herself voted in favour of the project.
With this argument, both the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies promoted two constitutional controversies to impugn the decree, and by admitting the demands, the minister Sánchez Cordero suspended the application of the decree and all the actions in it prepared for the digital transition.
The plenum of ministers resolved to dismiss the demand made by the Chamber of Deputies, without entering into the discussion of the project, also in charge of the minister Sánchez Cordero.
In his speech, the Minister President said that he did not agree with the arguments of the project, in the sense that the federal Executive cannot structure through general rules the measures for the public administration to prepare.
"I also do not think that if I did that it would affect the autonomy of the regulatory body", he said, adding that the planning of public policies in strategic areas such as the telecommunications sector is the responsibility of the federal executive, which has a constitutional mandate, the rectorate of the State.
The replacement of analogue signals by digital signals is one of the most important changes the world has undergone in recent years, and it results in better use of the radio spectrum, better signal quality and more channels.
Delaying the change, he said, would be to postpone the benefits of digitisation, which implies a decision of public interest, which does not have only a technical dimension, "since it covers economic, social, political and national security issues".
These issues, he stressed, "demand the operation of the entire established system, in accordance with the principle of economic rectorate of the State, encompasses a group of attributions that the Constitution leads to the faculty of the state Executive".
He recalled that a large number of countries around the world had already completed the digital transition, and had done so through the Executive, despite having highly specialized technical bodies.
It cannot be concluded that the Executive, by issuing the impugned decree, invades in any way the sphere of competence of the Congress, because it is providing in the administrative sphere the observance of the laws issued by the Legislature, he said.
They are analyzing the possibility of a "vote for vote" count in Michoacán
According to the data released by the PREP, the difference between first and second place in the gubernatorial election is only 27 percent, even without counting the votes for 879 of the 6,074 total.
The possibility of counting "votes by vote" is a reality in the electoral process this year in Michoacán, where according to the data released by the Preliminary Electoral Results Program (PREP), the difference between the first and second place in the gubernatorial election is only 27 percent, even without counting the votes corresponding to 879 of the 6 thousand 74 total records.
The president of the General Council of the Electoral Institute of Michoacán (IEM), María de los Ángeles Llanderal Zaragoza, recalled that just a few days ago, on November 9, the electoral body approved a series of lineaments in order to harmonize local norms with the federal reform in electoral matters.
As will be recalled, Michoacán did not homologate its Political Constitution or its State Electoral Code or its Electoral Justice Law, since the State Congress approved the reforms shortly before the legal deadline so that they could enter into force in the current electoral process and Governor Leonel Godoy Rangel omitted its publication in the deadlines provided for in the Law of the State Official Journal, with the argument that he had some objections.
On November 9, the Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation (SCJN) resolved the constitutional controversy promoted by the local Legislative Power and described the state's vote for constitutional reforms as "invalid and illegal", since it has no right to "sanction or veto them".
Interviewed about the possibility of "voting by vote", María de los Ángeles Llanderal said that thanks to the approval of the corresponding guidelines by the General Council of the IEM, it will be possible for the local electoral body to carry out partial and total recounting of the voting.
The partial counting of votes may therefore be carried out for one or more electoral packages if: the results of the voting are not the same; the vote counting report is not in the register of the polling station or is not in the possession of the polling station president; or there are obvious errors or alterations in the voting records.
Furthermore, the total number of votes received in all polling booths may be counted when there is evidence that the difference between the candidate who is presumed to have won the election in question and the candidate who has obtained the second place in the vote is equal to or less than one percentage point; provided that there is an express request at the beginning of the sitting from the representative of the party and/or coalition which nominated the second of the candidates indicated.
The total count of the votes may also be carried out if it is established at the end of the ordinary count that the difference between the presumed winner and the second-placed candidate is equal to or less than one percentage point, provided that there is an express request from the representative of the political party whose candidate came in second place, in which case the electoral packages which have been the subject of partial counting shall be excluded.
It should be mentioned that the election of Morelia is in this situation, where according to the PREP the difference between the first and second place is only 0.16 percent, although without counting the votes of 129 of the 923 total acts.
His last will and testament.
His ashes will be scattered in the Sierra de Zapalinamé, the family confirms.
The remains of pilot Felipe Bacio Cortés arrived in Saltillo, his hometown, this Sunday night, during the Monday were carried out reconnaissance and a requiem mass.
According to his relatives, the last wish of the lieutenant colonel was that his ashes be scattered in the Zapaliname mountain range.
After receiving a tribute from the other people who died in the accident, Bacio Cortés' family returned to the capital of Coahuila aboard a Mexican Air Force aircraft, the closest people attended the ceremony at Campo Marte.
At noon the ashes of the lieutenant colonel arrived at the chapel of velación located on the Nazario Ortiz Garza boulevard, where relatives and friends were arriving.
At 5:30 p.m. he was given a recognition at the Saltillo Technological Institute organized by his former classmates from the technological bachelor's degree and the American football team, of which Felipe Bacio was a part during his bachelor's degree preparation.
"His wish was to return to Saltillo and that his ashes were scattered in the Sierra de Zapalinamé, he always manifested this to his family and friends", this was made known by Sandra Bacio Cortés, the pilot's sister.
For her, the lieutenant colonel had fulfilled all her dreams, she considers that he was in the fullness of his life, "he was a successful man, extraordinary as a father, as a son, a loving brother and the dependent of his family".
Felipe Bacio Cortés left the city of Saltillo at a very young age to enter the Colegio del Aire in Zapopán, Jalisco.
Some did not believe him because they said that he even got sick in the truck; however, he always sought to fulfill his dream of becoming a pilot.
His nephew Jorge Alberto Dávila Bacio remembers him as a very good person, "as soon as he was in Saltillo all the family wanted to greet him, like the occasion when he brought Martha Sahagún to Saltillo".
The young man remembers that even when he was seven years old he traveled to Zapopan for his family's graduation, so he knows that his uncle died doing what he loved most in life: piloting an aircraft.
They give him a final goodbye
With honors was fired the Lieutenant Colonel of the Mexican Air Force, Felipe Bacio Cortés, in homage that headed the governor Jorge Torres López, and that gave him people and State Government, the Mexican Army, through the Sixth Military Zone, the Mexican Air Force itself, managers and students of the Technological of Saltillo, where he studied in 1985 and stood out both in the study and in the sport.

They locate three bodies abandoned on Cadereyta NL estate
Hours before the discovery, the military authority presented to the media eleven people who were arrested in the same municipality for crimes related to organized crime.
Three men were found shot dead in different parts of the body and with the gunshot, in an abandoned farm in the municipality of Cadereyta Jiménez, Nuevo León.
The find happened at kilometer 1.5 of the road from Cadereyta to Santiago, at the height of the community known as El Castillo.
Several people who passed by the place observed that in the fifth, whose barda is beige with coffee, was the gate open wide.
Looking in, about three meters, they located the bodies of three people, so they immediately notified the authorities.
One of the men was wearing a yellow shirt with dark lace trousers, no shoes; next to him was another with a white t-shirt.
A few feet away was the body of another man in a red shirt and blue tights.
All three were upside down.
According to the data obtained at the scene, the three people would have been killed elsewhere, since no shells were found at the site.
On the bar of the farm, there are legends that go from one group of organized crime to another, in addition to several bullet holes in the farm and the gate.
11 captured at Cadereyta
The Secretariat of National Defense presented 11 people, including a minor, who were part of a criminal group that operated mainly in the municipality of Cadereyta and who are related to kidnappings, homicides, "halconeo" and clandestine inhumations.
According to the information made public, in a first incident on November 11 in the Los Alveros colony, eight people were arrested and one person was rescued from custody.
They were given three buildings and a cell phone; they claimed to be members of the criminal group called "Los Zetas".
In another incident on November 12 at 06:00 hours, military personnel conducted a surveillance tour in the town of Rancho Viejo, in Cadereyta, detecting a car without plates and with two subjects on board.
Upon marking the high and conducting the inspection, the military found a long gun, a magazine and 18 cartridges.
After these statements, on November 13 at 14:00 hours, one of his accomplices in the ejido La Frauda was arrested, who, seeing the military, tried to flee.
They are attributed to clandestine burials in the municipalities of General Terán, China and Cadereyta.
The new Italian government will be formed on Wednesday
The prime minister-designate, Mario Monti, will meet tomorrow with the president of Italy to introduce the new government that will face a crisis that has placed that country on the brink of economic disaster.
The newly appointed Italian Prime Minister, Mario Monti, will meet with the Italian President on Wednesday to introduce the new government that will face a crisis that has brought Italy to the brink of economic disaster and endangered the entire eurozone.
A statement from the presidential palace announced that Monti, appointed on Sunday, will meet with the president, Giorgio Napolitano, on Wednesday to confirm that he can form a government.
He is expected to present a cabinet made up mostly of technocrats, though it is unclear when the new executive will take office.
Monti said he would present the president with the results of his talks with the political parties in their attempt to form a government.
"I want to confirm my absolute confidence in the ability of our country to overcome this difficult phase", the former European commissioner told reporters.
Monti did not explicitly say he will be able to form a government but the tone of his comments indicated that the obstacles have been overcome.
The "framework is now well defined", he added.
Monti has completed the process of forming a government in less than three days, much less than normal, as Italy battles a political and financial crisis that has driven its debt costs to unsustainable levels.
The new administration led by former European Commissioner Monti must approve a tough austerity package demanded by European leaders to regain battered confidence in Italy.
Underlining the pressure on Monti to act quickly, the instability in the markets put the yield on Italy's BTP 10-year bonds above 7 percent, the level at which Greece and Ireland were forced to be bailed out.
Emma Marcegaglia, leader of Italian employers' union Confindustria, told the press after meeting with Monti: "We said we would support this government very much".
We believe that this government is the last chance for Italy to get out of this emergency situation.
Monti's chances of success were boosted considerably by the backing of Silvio Berlusconi's PDL party, which the crisis forced to resign on Saturday.
"We believe that the efforts of Professor Monti are destined to have a good result", Angelino Alfano, secretary of the centre-right party, told the press.
The support of the PDL, Italy's largest party, is significant because until now many of its members had opposed the technocratic majority government that Monti is forming.
Parliamentary support
The new Monti government must have strong parliamentary support to implement what will likely be unpopular austerity reforms.
Any blockage or delay in their efforts could trigger a devastating new attack by the financial markets.
The Italian association of foreign banks added to the pressure by warning that a failure of Monti would be a disaster.
Monti began her consultations with political parties, trade unions and business groups, as well as youth and women's organizations, on Monday.
He'll end his round of meetings on Tuesday night.
Monti was appointed on Sunday by Napolitano, who has enabled an extremely rapid transition in response to the crisis.
After a brief respite late last week when it became clear that Berlusconi would resign, Italian debt costs have now returned to critical levels amid uncertainty over whether the new prime minister will be successful.
Bailing out Italy, with a public debt of 1.8 trillion euros, would be too much for the current financial defenses of the eurozone.
Monti has said his government should last until the next election, scheduled for 2013, despite widespread predictions that politicians will only give him time to implement reforms before moving the election forward.
Monti has said he would like to include politicians in his cabinet, but the big parties insist that it should be made up of only technicians, an indication of his reservations about a process forced by financial pressure.
Political sources pointed out that mutual mistrust and disagreements between the parties are complicating the attempt to include political figures.
The Spanish touch is superior to the ticos
Of the 22 players called from Spain, ten exceed the 50 international games.
On the Costa Rican side, only one of the 22 players who were called up made it to the 50 games.
A stark contrast to Costa Rica, if you compare the 22 players called up by both countries for today's friendly, at 3:05 p.m., at the National Stadium in San Jose.
While the world and European champions, number one in the monthly FIFA ranking, have a wide record of interselections of class A games, the Tricolor only has the defender Michael Umaña as the only one who has all 50 international matches.
He reached that mark on Friday in the match against Panama (0-2), at Rommel Fernández.
Spanish players who play in the League of Stars and in powerful clubs in the English Premier League, maintain an intense activity in domestic league and cup championships, and high-level clashes in European cups such as the Champions League.
The previous experience with the Spanish Furia in complicated qualifiers of the European Cup and the World Cup football.
The Czech footballers, on the other hand, have a limited international reach in one area, such as Concacaf, which is considered the lowest level within FIFA.
We see that the maximum record of the Spanish National Team is the goalkeeper Íker Casillas, who on Saturday before against England (fall 0-1 in London) equalled the record of the exporters Andoni Zubizarreta, with 126 international matches.
Casillas will play today against the Tricolor and they will set a new record for Spain of 127 internationals.
Xavi Hernandez, the brain steering wheel of Barcelona, has 106.
Casillas and Xavi were even recognized the previous week by UEFA along with the other centenarians of the Iberian team, the aforementioned Zubizarreta with 126 and the Schalke's ram, Raúl González, with 102.
Almost close to the century figure is Carles Puyol, with 97 games.
Le is followed by Xabi Alonso, with [ Fernando Torres, with 90; David Villa and Sergio Ramos, both with 81; Andrés Iniesta, with 62; Cesc Fábregas, with 61; and David Silva, with 53.
On the tico side, and close to Michael Umaña, are left winger Júnior Díaz, with 48 appearances and artilleryman Bryan Ruiz, with 45.
After that, only five went beyond the 30 games: Keilor Navas with 31, Randall Azofeifa with 32, Michael Barrantes with 31, Carlos Hernández with 36 and José Luis López with 35.
The less.
With more than 30 performances in Spain, they include Gerard Piqué (37), Sergio Busquets (36), Santiago Santi Cazorla (32), Álvaro Arbeloa (31) and Raúl Albiol (31).
From the national side, with less than 30 appearances, Roy Miller with 26, Winston Parks with 26, Gabriel Badilla with 25 and Roy Myrie with 23.
The rest of them don't come nearer to 8:00.
While Nacho Moreal has only four games and Jordi Alba two, in Costa Rica Víctor Bolívar has only one and Ólman Vargas and Edder Nelson have not yet debuted.
Spain's all-time leading scorer is David Villa, with 50 goals, followed by Fernando Torres with 27.
For Costa Rica, Bryan Ruiz is the one who records the most with nine, two more than Carlos Hernández and three more than Roy Myrie and Parks.
Quintet included the country in its tour celebrating two decades of career
"Going to Costa Rica is a dream come true"
In an exclusive interview with Viva, bassist Jeff Ament of Pearl Jam said the band is ready to deliver one of their best concerts ever next Sunday at the National Stadium.
It's been more than 20 years of waiting, but the band says that for them too it will be to make the dream of playing in the country a reality.
Bass player and founding member Jeff Ament said, speaking exclusively with Viva from Brazil last week.
The group is on the South American leg of their tour celebrating two decades of work and on Sunday 20 will make their only stop in Central America.
That day they will perform at the National Stadium, starting at 7:30 p.m., along with the Angolan band The X and the nationals of Las Robertas.
This is an excerpt from the conversation, the full transcript of which is at The Nation on the Internet.
For their Costa Rican fans, it's a dream come true for Pearl Jam to play in Costa Rica, are they aware of what their fans are going through?
Going to Costa Rica is a dream come true for us, too.
This is only our second time in South and Central America and so far it's been great.
I've been to Costa Rica only once and on vacation; it's such a beautiful country and I think we're going to be able to stay there for a few days.
So we're excited to get our music out there.
I ask because there's a kind of devotion to the band, the fans live with intensity the days before.
What do you say to your most ardent followers?
Thank you for sticking by us through all these years.
It took us almost 21 years to get to Costa Rica; thank you for waiting so long and we're sorry that it took us so long to get there.
Some people are even already referring to their concert as the biggest show of the year.
Does that add a little pressure to your visit?
Some of the biggest shows we've played in the last 21 years have happened in the last couple of weeks.
We played a couple of huge shows in Sao Paulo and we hope that that's got us in shape for this gig in Costa Rica.
We're really looking forward to playing there.
We love that country, we love surfing and the jungle, and for both, Costa Rica is among the best in the world.
How did you guys discover Costa Rica and its surfing waves?
We have a lot of friends who are surfers and I have a great friend who lives in Tamarindo and the waves there are amazing.
My friends always went surfing to Costa Rica and Nicaragua, along with Mexico, are great places to surf, and that's how we found out, through people who love to surf.
Seeing the tour, they've been coming in delivering huge shows with a lot of songs.
What are you planning for your Costa Rican show?
Since we've never played there before, we have no restrictions on what we can do.
We're gonna try to put on the best show possible with a good variety of songs; we're gonna try to play a couple of songs from each album and give our fans a good, diverse repertoire.
You never repeat the repertoire.
What's this about?
I think it's partly because we have nine albums and we can play over 120 songs and everyone likes different songs, so it's hard to pick which songs to play every night.
When we have two or three songs in our repertoire that we haven't played for a while, it keeps us focused and it also keeps us amazed because it reminds us of the reasons why we liked those songs and that we might have forgotten.
That makes the show more interesting for us and therefore, I think it also makes it more interesting for people.
With this tour, they're celebrating 20 years of touring.
Looking back, is it hard to believe all that they have accomplished?
Yes, it is.
First of all, I don't think any of us imagined that we'd be in a big rock band and having done it for over 20 years makes it seem like a dream.
We keep counting our blessings and we're so excited that we can keep making music together.
We all love each other and we all love making music.
We're lucky to go to places in the world we've always wanted to go.
Things couldn't be better for us.
What did it mean to you to be a fundamental part of the rise of grunge?
It's always been an honor to be a part of that group of great bands.
We're very close friends with the people from Soundgarden, Mudhoney and Alice in Chains.
It's amazing when a movement comes from a group of friends, and it's rare.
Every now and then, a band from one city comes out, but it's much stranger when five or ten bands come out of the same city at the same time.
We are proud and honored to be part of the Seattle group.
We still play with some of them from time to time.
Last year, we were at a festival with Alice in Chains and we were in Canada with Mudhoney, we saw Soundgarden on tour, so we're lucky to be friends with all of them still and we're honored to be a part of that Seattle sound that came out of it.
It's also very strange that a band like yourselves can stay together with the same members for so long.
Yeah, the four of us have been together for 21 years and Matt (Cameron) joined us 13 years ago, which, by itself, is a lot longer than most bands last.
First, I think we're all lucky to be alive, and second, we all care about each other.
We are all very close friends and thanks to that, musical avenues have also been opened which give each one the freedom to experiment.
We trust each other with each other's music and it couldn't be better.
Your relationship with the word fame has not been easy, but thanks to your success, you have been able to do whatever you want.
How do they find balance?
As we've grown, it's been easier to find a balance.
We make sure you don't get too much on the road because it's easy to fall into that game of the big crowds and the people who love your music.
As long as you remember that people are there for the music, that's a reminder that you should respect the music and what it brought, not get all worked up about being famous and being a rock star, which is something that none of us really care about.
How do you remember your other project Mother Love Bone?
I think we wrote some really good songs and it was kind of great at first.
We were a band for almost three years and we never released an album until after Andy (Andrew Woods) died.
There was a lot of frustration because it was going to be so long and most importantly we're still very good friends with Bruce (Fairweather) and Greg (Gilmore), who started in the band with us and when I hear a song or I see a picture I think about the amazing person that Andy was and how he made me laugh, it was always a pleasure to go to work, laugh, talk about music and football and so much more.
He was an amazing human being and we missed him.
The national band Las Robertas will be the one in charge of opening the show in Costa Rica.
Is it true that you know her work, especially Eddie Vedder, and that's why you chose her for the opening?
Yeah, the production sent us videos with various proposals and that was the band we liked the most, so we're looking forward to seeing what Las Robertas can offer live and it should be very entertaining.
Why do they always change the lyrics to Yellow Ledbetter live?
That's a question for Ed, so I don't know.
He sings it and I think he does it with the first thing that comes to mind.
As a bass player, what are your influences?
There are so many.
Some of the first people I can think of are Geezer Butler, John Entwistle, C.J. Ramone, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukowski...
So many I could talk all afternoon about the bass players I love.
How has Pearl Jam managed to keep grunge relevant despite it no longer being a fad?
I think all of us have always felt a little bit disconnected from the word grunge.
When I think about it, it reminds me of the bands that I mentioned earlier, like Mudhoney, Soundgarden, Nirvana, and all the ones that came out around the same time, and if there's relevance now, I think it's a wonderful thing because it's music that's worth listening to, and bands like Mudhoney are making better music now than ever.
At first, his music had a darker content and now it has become more positive.
Why this change?
It's interesting because I think there's a couple of songs on the new album that maybe seem lighter, but there are also songs, like The End or Just Breathe that qualify as very dark songs even though they can sound a little bit positive.
With both of them, when Ed played them for me, I cried when I heard them and they're deeply dark songs.
I think when you grow up and there's some trauma in your life and you lose a family member or a friend, those things start to influence your art and your music and those two songs, without a doubt, represent that to me.
I also think that you can be a happy person and still be able to make music that's dark.
Peru:
Fujimori is admitted again for medical examinations
Former president Alberto Fujimori was admitted to a public hospital on Tuesday to be evaluated for the loss of muscle strength he has in his legs, his head doctor reported.
Fujimori, 72, who is serving a 25-year prison sentence for human rights violations committed during his 1990-2000 rule, suffers from several ailments, including a tongue cancer for which he has been operated on four times and is being kept under control.
Congressman Alejandro Aguinaga, who is his personal physician, told the N TV channel that Fujimori will be evaluated for three days at the National Institute of Neoplastic Diseases to determine the reason for the pain and loss of strength in his lower limbs.
Aguinaga commented that in his opinion Fujimori would be a candidate to obtain the benefit of the pardon for humanitarian reasons, however, he said that he does not want it because he knows he is innocent.
He was operated four times for cancer of the tongue, has a weight loss of 18 kilos to which other pathologies have been added such as severe erosive gastritis, pancreatic cyst, kidney stones, arterial hypertension and circulatory problems in the legs, the doctor listed.
Fujimori has been in prison since September 2007 in the National Police Special Operations Directorate.
In April 2009 he was sentenced to 25 years in prison for the killing of 25 people by an army annihilation squad that operated clandestinely in the early years of his government.
Mujica travels to Mexico to strengthen political ties
An official delegation, headed by Uruguayan President José Mujica and made up of several ministers and businessmen, will begin a visit to Mexico on Tuesday to expand trade between the two nations and discuss political issues in the region.
Mujica will meet next Wednesday with his Mexican counterpart, Felipe Calderón, the highest point of an extensive agenda of meetings with political, commercial authorities and a meeting with the community of Uruguayans living in Mexico, according to the agenda released by the Uruguayan Presidency.
The meeting between the two presidents, in the city of Guadalajara, will be "propitious for the exchange of information on all political matters between the two nations", according to the presidency of the South American country on its website.
According to local media, Mujica would seek to get Calderón to support Uruguay in the incident with France that arose when the French president, Nicolas Sarkozy, included the South American country in a list of tax havens, at the G20 meeting in the French city of Cannes.
In his speech, Sarkozy threatened to exclude from the international community those countries which remained tax havens, a statement which provoked the rejection of Uruguay and the call for consultation of its ambassador in the European country.
Mexico has been the chair of the G20 group of the world's most powerful emerging and developed countries since November, and has an agreement with the South American country to exchange tax information to avoid double taxation since January of this year.
The Uruguayan government has in recent years tried to speed up the implementation of tax-exchange agreements in order to get out of the "grey list" of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), consisting of countries that did not implement all international standards of cooperation in tax matters.
In the commercial field, Mexico and Uruguay have had a Free Trade Agreement (FTA) in force since 2004, which has increased the exchange of goods between both nations.
The mustache plumber is going all three dimensions with "Super Mario 3D Land"
Super Mario has fought tirelessly for 25 years to save Princess Peach from the evil Bowser, but never before in three dimensions: in "Super Mario 3D Land" he will fight for the girl's love in stereoscopic technology.
The title, which is coming to stores worldwide this month, was designed from the start to take advantage of the features of the Nintendo 3DS handheld console, which allows play in three dimensions without the need to use glasses.
"Mario is the character who has to say how the stereoscopy without glasses should work", said the responsible for specialized press of Nintendo in Spain, Omar Álvarez, during the presentation of the video game in Madrid.
Álvarez stated that "Super Mario 3D Land" is "Nintendo's first video game originally designed for that support", as previously hits like "Star Fox 64 3D" or "Zelda: Ocarine of time 3D" were adaptations of existing titles.
The Nintendo spokesman has maintained that, despite being in 3D, "Super Mario 3D Land" is an "accessible" video game that allows you to enjoy a fast and fluid gameplay.
Álvarez has stated that "Super Mario 3D Land" contains two games in one: the first part is "simple" to hook the less skilled users.
Once overcome, the more expert players can take a "second turn" at the levels of play, which this time present greater difficulty.
In addition, users will be able to choose in real time between an "aggressive D" or one that only affects the depth of the action, but it will be necessary to play in three dimensions in order to overcome the different challenges and "not succumb to optical illusions".
This foray of Super Mario into the three dimensions also means the return of the character to a portable console, a fact that had not occurred since 2005.
In this video game Nintendo nods to the fans of the saga and repeats the formula of the success of the previous installments, consisting of the plumber with a mustache will have to travel through mined platforms of dangers with the aim of freeing Princess Peach.
Although the player will find novelties in the moves, the environments, the costumes and the enemies and also a "playable" Luigi.
Colom backs Portillo's extradition to the US
President Álvaro Colom announced Tuesday that he has given the go-ahead for the extradition of former governor Alfonso Portillo to answer in the United States for the conspiracy to launder US$70 million.
Thus ends the process for Guatemala to respond to the request of the northern country that claimed Portillo to try him there.
In a press conference, Colom said that his decision was based on the independence of the judiciary and the executive, taking into account that a sentencing court had already ordered the extradition.
He said that during his term of office he "did not put his hands" in judicial resolutions and gave the go-ahead to all the extraditions he has known.
In addition to Portillo, Sergio Ruano Marroquín will be extradited, for murder and serious injuries, and Edgar Estrada Morales and Víctor Estrada Paredes, both for drug trafficking.
What Colom did is an executive procedure after all the judicial and constitutional instances to prosecute the former president between 2000 and 2004 were exhausted.
According to decisions of the Fifth Criminal Court and the Constitutional Court (CC), Portillo should be extradited once he has solved his legal situation in Guatemala and his human rights are guaranteed.
Portillo was acquitted of embezzling Q120 million from the Ministry of Defense when he was president, which was the process that preceded extradition, but the Public Ministry appealed and reactivated the case.
Trinijove has helped 6,000 at-risk youth
The entity was born to prevent the fall in the marginality of children without training
The balance of the first 25 years of the Trinijove social support institution is important: 6,000 young people at risk of exclusion have received help to overcome a difficult situation throughout this quarter of a century.
In addition, there are currently over 100 jobs for this social group.
The anniversary was celebrated yesterday in the old factory complex of Fabra i Coats, with over 300 people in attendance.
Trinijove was founded in the Trinitat Vella district in 1986 with the aim of helping young people with little education, without work, with problems of upbringing or in a situation of marginalization.
Yesterday's celebration in Sant Andreu brought together a large number of leaders from organizations and institutions that have collaborated with the association for 25 years.
The varied political representation, in the midst of the elections, showed the unity of the work carried out by Trinijove.
The event was attended by the President of the Generalitat, Artur Mas, and his predecessor Jordi Pujol, the Ex-Conseller of Socialist Education, Ernest Maragall, and the former mayor and current ecosocialist councilor Ricard Gomà.
The current Conseller for Social Welfare and Family, Josep Lluís Cleries, and the Director General of the Social Work of La Caixa, Jaume Lanaspa, also attended the Fabra i Coats' main hall.
Mas said that Trinijove was born in a very difficult time and that the current one is also, but added that the work done so far "is a good basis".
The President pointed to Trinijove as an example of how to fight against bad circumstances and to give hope to people in difficulty.
"The crisis is not something new for the entity and for the work it does", he said.
They evicted an occupied farm where they used to hold macro-fests
The invaders had taken over 11 of the 13 floors of the building, at Balmes, 51
All 12 occupants left the estate yesterday at noon without offering any resistance.
It seems that the nightmare of the residents of 51 Balmes Street has come to an end.
Twelve people left yesterday at noon voluntarily the building they occupied illegally, and where they organized macrofiestas that despaired the neighborhood, by judicial order and without the need for police intervention.
When the operation was completed, the door lock was changed to prevent a repeat of the situation.
"From now on there will be an access control", the administrator said.
The squatters, who had invaded 11 of the 13 floors of the building - the rest are inhabited - took away all the electrical installation and part of the water installation, in addition to painting the walls and leaving all kinds of waste, especially cans of alcoholic beverages.
The first three floors were the scene of the mass parties, which lasted up to two days and made the tenants desperate.
Next to the building is a nightclub, Balmes 51, which has also been damaged.
The owner, Maria Pantinat, told Europa Press that since the building was occupied, business has fallen by 80%.
The owner of the disco points out that the invaders of the estate were unfair competition, since they sold the drinks for three euros, while in the disco they are worth 10.
In addition, the owner of the entertainment venue had had to respond to neighbouring complaints about noise, while, according to her, the disturbances were not caused by the customers of the disco, but by the inhabitants of the occupied house and, above all, the attendees of the parties organized there, which had increased their frequency and intensity in recent weeks, according to the angry neighbors of the area.
The manager of the disco explained that the inconvenience was so great that she even reached an agreement with the owner of the building and nine months ago that "forgives" the rent.
The City Guard also confirmed that during the last weeks had received more complaints from neighbors about the situation.
The president of the municipal group of the PP in the town hall, Alberto Fernández Díaz, had claimed last week "to immediately evict the building to end the problems of coexistence and civicism that produce the neighbors, as well as the degradation of the area".
The popular leader explained that before the summer there was only one floor of the building occupied, but over the past months the squatters had been entering all the floors of the building and almost all the floors, and that in some even there have been robberies.
He added that "it is necessary to put an end to impunity and to be firm against the inquisitiveness that has been generated in the estate".
Also yesterday, the Mossos evicted a building in Nou Barris.
At 3:30 p.m. the police went to 35 rue de Mont-ral, after receiving a call from a neighbor who had observed that four people were entering the building.
All four were arrested on the spot.
Park or mountain?
Architects agree on the timing of the call beyond controversy over fees
The municipal competition on the 16 doors reopens the debate on the role of Collserola in Barcelona
In the mid-1980s, at the height of the now defunct Corporación Metropolitana de Barcelona (CMB), this Administration printed some promotional cards for Collserola.
The brochure defined the mountain as the great park of metropolitan Barcelona.
In fact, it was accompanied by a comparison, in figures, with New York's Central Park.
With the death of the CMB, in 1987, the park was again situated, in the imagination of many, as the upper limit of Barcelona, being the Catalan capital of the few that are not oriented on the north-south axis but up (mountain) -down (sea).
The classification of Collserola as a natural park is based on this idea.
The reference was no longer Central Park but Yellowstone, with the wild boar as the Yogi bear.
These were in place until, in September, the city council called a mega competition consisting of 16 contests for as many other access gates to Collserola.
A gate is a park, for sure.
Either that or someone's trying to put doors on the field.
The question is: "Slippery slope, park or mountain?"
The competition, both for its merely organizational aspect and for what it means of reflection on the city is the topic of conversation among all the Barcelona architects.
It's almost a recurring theme when two members of this ancient chosen caste recognize each other in an elevator.
And this fact gives rise, precisely, to one of the few coincidences between the opinions of three architects from Barcelona, and university professors, who have presented themselves.
Miguel Roldán, Daniel Mòdol and Marta Bayona: the competition is timely.
For Roldán, after tackling the coastal front, it is "necessary" to debate "the mountain front", since the speech of Ildefons Cerdà, the one about the green apples, has not been carried out.
"It is to be assumed that the largest park in Barcelona is the beach.
Among other things, because of its great accessibility.
The architect, for whom the title 'Collserola's doors' is a 'lexical trap', says that it is not necessary to think of them 'as entrances to a park, but as the delimitation of areas where action is needed'.
Mòdol, like Roldán and Bayona with experience in the urban world, calls the proposal an "intellectual challenge" with "some dangers".
The Commission has also proposed that the Commission should submit a proposal to the Council for a directive on the protection of the environment by preventing and combating pollution from ships and aircraft.
The first fear is the very delineation of boundaries on where to build.
"To limit something is to fix the next step", that is, to overstep it.
"We need to think about new urban planning instruments, because the current ones [referring to the General Metropolitan Plan (PGM) ] can lead to real disasters".
More closely related to the question, Mòdol argues that, simplifying, the Collserola slope "can be understood as a park, the one in Barcelona, not", for a purely topographical question.
Mòdol recalls that there is already a work done by the Patronat of Collserola that "should not fall into a sack", although he is grateful for the opportunity that the town hall offers his guild to intervene in this project "from the first moment".
And even more, he understands that the proximity of the mountain to the city is the safe passage that allows architects to enter the debate, but "doubt" whether it is this technical profile that should lead the multidisciplinary teams ("everything a hit", he points out) that have had to be created: "Architects should be only a tool".
Bayona insinuates that the answer to the question that gives the title to this piece is complex, because the basis of the competition lacks a global vision of Collserola: "16 transversal competitions have been called - he says - in the mountain-sea sense, but there is no longitudinal reading, which sees and understands the area as a whole".
This leads, at least in his case, to the fact that he has chosen to participate in all 16 competitions.
Otherwise, a project for one of the doors may clash in program and definition with that of the architect of the next door.
In his opinion, the city council should ensure that the strip immediately above the Ronda de Dalt should provide, throughout its length, a zone of equipment that would make a smooth transition between the city and the green.
Casino forgives Jonas Larrazabal and he is free.
After 72 days of arraigation, the legal representative of the Casino Red granted the brother of the mayor of Monterrey the pardon of the process that was followed for alleged blackmail
After 72 days in prison, Manuel Jonás Larrazábal will be released after the legal representative of Casino Red granted him a pardon before the Second District Criminal Court, which is pursuing a process for blackmail against the brother of the mayor of Monterrey.
After the attack on Casino Royale, the owner of Casino Red, Sergio Gil García, made public a series of photographs and videos in which Manuel Jonás allegedly demanded the payment of an economic fee so that the regional council allowed the clandestine operation of the betting house.
After the public complaint, the state prosecutor's office opened a criminal case against the brother of the mayor of Panista and on September 2 was arrested and arraigado for 30 days.
After four hours before the Public Ministry Agent 3 in Patrimonial Offences, he was transferred to the Casa de Arraigo 1, located in the Old Quarter of the state capital.
He remained there for the next 49 days after a second arrest warrant was issued after the Public Ministry agent dismissed the crimes of cohecho and organized crime.
On October 19, he was transferred to the Cadereyta prison allegedly for blackmailing the owners of Casino Red with one and a half million pesos; however, he only stayed a few hours in the medium security prison since there were death threats against him.
The authorities allowed him to continue the trial in the municipal cells of San Nicolás de los Garza.
On October 25, an arrest warrant was issued by the secretary of the Second District Penal Court, Jorge Yánez, who said that after almost two months of investigations, sufficient evidence was found to determine the guilt of Jonás, such as the collection of 1.5 million pesos from the representatives of the betting house in exchange for allowing the operation of the same.
This Monday, the legal representative of Casino Red, Víctor Aldo García Gómez, went to judge José Luis Pecina to request forgiveness for the brother of the mayor; so that in the next few hours he could regain his freedom.
During the legal proceedings, the agent of the Public Ministry attached to the Court, Ramiro Arias, questioned García Gómez whether the damage had been repaired and which of the partners of the betting house was the one who granted the pardon, although the lawyer tried to reserve the name.
Based on the 197/2011 file, Jonás Larrazábal is granted a legal pardon and thereafter no claim can be made regarding the process that was followed; in addition, no reparation of damage or punishment will be required.
After the hearing with the legal representative of the betting house, at about 15:50 hours, Larrazabal Bretón was ordered to be released immediately.
The secretary of the Court, Jorge Yánez, went to the jail of the municipality of San Nicolás de los Garza to notify Jonás that he has been legally pardoned and his file will be archived.
He will also notify you of the judge's order for your immediate release.
Secretary Dionisio Pérez Jácome gives details of the plane crash in which the Secretary of the Government, Francisco Blake, and seven other people lost their lives
The Secretariat of Communications and Transportation (SCT) reported that the results of the accident where the secretary of the Government, Francisco Blake Mora, and seven other people lost their lives, indicate that the helicopter directly impacted the ground in complete structural integrity, without the pilot being able to attempt a forced landing.
During a press conference, Dionisio Pérez Jácome, Secretary of Communications and Transport, mentioned that before taking off the aircraft, the pilot found that the weather conditions were suitable for flying.
"Elements that seem to indicate the unit had several contacts with the ground, the blades had contact with trees at 25 meters where the unit lost the fuselage".
He also reported that the unit was designed for 19 people, so it had the necessary requirements to transport the staff.
In addition, he said that in the investigations made in the impact zone no appearance of pieces on the ground is reported.
"A search reported no parts or components of the ship elsewhere, the impact was presented in a structural form.
"The helicopter was designed for 19 passengers, it had adequate requirements to transport the passengers.
The terrain has a seven-degree slope at 30 degrees of inclination.
For the time being, the secretary said that it is a priority to have the results as soon as possible; however, the investigation can last for several months, even could reach a year.
Gilberto López Meyer, director general of Aeroports and Auxiliary Services, said that at the time of the impact, the helicopter of the Presidential Staff was operating at cruising speed and that this happened on a soft ascending terrain.
"This information strengthens the hypothesis of a normal cruise operation at the time of impact", he said.
At the press conference, the head of the SCT, Pérez Jácome, listed six relevant elements in the investigation:
Visual flight:
According to the aeronautical regulations the flight was performed under the visual flight rules, this implies that the crew must have visibility during the flight and the terrain.
The weather conditions:
Reports at the AICM located adequate conditions at takeoff, as the aircraft advanced towards the border area between the DF and the State of Mexico layers of clouds were present at low altitude.
Selected routes:
It is likely that due to the cloudy conditions the crew has looked for a lower elevation and greater visibility towards the valley of Cuernavaca.
Location of impact.
The impact coordinates and the aircraft's last radar record match, so there was probably no loss of control or alteration in flight path before the impact.
Dispersion of aircraft debris in a restricted area:
The information available so far suggests that the impact occurred on a straight and sideways trajectory.
The pattern of dispersion of debris from the aircraft suggests that the helicopter struck the ground in structural integrity.
No evidence of fire or explosion detected:
At the crash site, no evidence of any kind of explosion or fire has been revealed in the wreckage.
The latest results of the investigation indicate that he may have had multiple contacts with the ground.
During field work, parts of the aircraft were found at an elevation of 9,200 feet above mean sea level, the terrain having a slope ranging from seven degrees to 30 degrees of inclination.
The photographs show the sequence in which it was predictably dismantled along that route.
The information provided appears to indicate that the helicopter may have had multiple impacts on the ground.
After a thorough search of a wider area than the designated site, around the crash, no scattered parts of the aircraft have been found, which strengthens the presumption that the impact occurred in conditions of structural integrity.
MSS announces protocol to find gene of obesity
Social Security is leading a research project to discover the gene of obesity in children and young people; it is supported by specialists from the IPN
The Mexican Institute of Social Security (IMSS) announced that it is conducting research to discover the gene of obesity in children and young people, called the 'Genetics of childhood and adolescence obesity' protocol, which will allow for markers associated with overweight.
In a statement, the head of the Medical Research Unit in Biochemistry of the Hospital of Specialties of the National Medical Center Siglo XXI, Miguel Cruz López, explained that a multidisciplinary team of doctors, nurses, nutritionists and social workers was integrated.
The team is supported by specialists and postgraduate students from the National Institute of Public Health (INSP) and the Center for Research and Advanced Studies (Cinvestav) of the National Polytechnic Institute (IPN).
The population is invited to participate in the research, whether or not they are entitled, to go to the participating sports units of the IMSS in the Valley of Mexico, where the tests are carried out to minors, every Saturday from 8:00 am.
He noted that the protocol began in the Cuauhtémoc Sports Unit (Eastern State of Mexico) and that since October 8, the activity is held in the Nezahualcóyolt Sports Unit (Eastern State of Mexico).
Once the target of 500 or 600 children is met, the study will continue in the Independencia Sports Unit (south of the Federal District) and finally in the Morelos Sports Unit (north of the Federal District).
He explained that the purpose of this research is to know the components and the importance of genetics with respect to the development of obesity and to identify in children and young Mexicans risk factors to prevent the occurrence of chronic degenerative diseases.
The World Diabetes Day is being celebrated on November 14th, and the aim is to bring together 3,000 children and youth between the ages of 6 and 14, with the consent and supervision of their parents, to apply specific questionnaires about food.
They will also be asked about their physical activity and family history of hereditary diseases, in order to avoid risk factors for conditions such as diabetes or kidney failure.
He explained that on Saturdays all participants undergo anthropometric measurements (weight, height, waist circumference), blood pressure, glucose, triglycerides, cholesterol and insulin levels, and genetic tests (they seek to identify genes associated with childhood obesity).
Cruz López said that this investigation is due to the concern of health professionals for the alarming increase in weight in children.
'The health surveys of 1999 and 2006 indicated that in just six years there was an increase, in the case of boys, of 77 percent in obesity, and of girls of 47 percent; in terms of overweight also a dramatic rise was observed,' the specialist of the IMSS stressed.
He said the rationale for the search for the markers is based on the fact that the country's population differs from others by its genetic history.
He reported that on average, the Mexican has 65 percent American Indian heritage, 30 percent European and five percent African and this condition is reflected in genes associated with diabetes and overweight.
He explained that in general, the genetics of obesity translate into the inability to burn the excess energy we consume (calories) and which is stored in the form of fat.
The researcher explained that the direct benefit for the participants is the comprehensive evaluation of the children, which allows detecting whether they present any degree of overweight or obesity.
Even, he said, the presence of dark-colored folds (acantosis) on his neck and forearm, which indicate the likelihood of metabolic disturbances and even prediabetes.
The information is kept confidential, and doctors give it in writing to parents, who are then told about each measurement and lifestyle change they need to make to prevent disease.
Cruz López explained that there are three main components that cause overweight, obesity and other chronic conditions: sedentarism, which is the lack of daily physical activity, sitting in front of the television most of the day and using means of transportation instead of walking short distances.
It is also due to the high caloric intake, i.e. the higher consumption of sugary drinks, of carbohydrates (tamales, bread, pizza, hamburger, etc.) with high fat and protein content and the genetics that are analyzed in this protocol.
Asphalt from UNAM would prevent potholes
Rafael Herrera, researcher at the Faculty of Chemistry of UNAM, develops polymer-modified asphalt to produce a mixture with better performance, regardless of environmental conditions and temperature
If the signals sent by the pavimento were attended, it would not be necessary to repair about 200 thousand potholes each season of rains in the Metropolitan Zone of the Valley of Mexico, warned Rafael Herrera Nájera, researcher of the Faculty of Chemistry (FQ) of UNAM, who assured that if the process of construction and maintenance of an asphalt pavimento is adequate, the potholes could be reduced in quantity or, even, eliminated completely.
In his lecture A technological opinion of the bumps, delivered in the framework of the International Year of Chemistry, he announced that the laboratory he was in charge of was developing asphaltes modified with polymers to produce a mixture with characteristics similar to asphalt, but with greater mechanical resistance, both at high and low temperatures.
Herrera Nájera estimated that this type of modified asphalt could be used in places where the climate is extremely hot, such as some cities in the north of the country, to improve its performance and, therefore, the formation of potholes.
He explained that asphalt, the heaviest part of petroleum, is a set of hydrocarbon molecules, some of high molecular weight, called asphaltenes, and others of low molecular weight, called maltenes, which together give the pavement its characteristic viscoelastic behavior.
The viscoelastic behaviour of asphalt is that at high temperatures, close to 180 degrees, it behaves like a liquid, at 120 degrees Celsius its viscosity is very high and at 50 degrees Celsius it presents an almost solid state, while at very low temperatures, asphalt becomes brittle, he added.
This means that the strength of the asphalt is not uniform on the streets, but is changing during the day according to environmental conditions and temperature, the chemical engineering specialist warned.
The FQ researcher observed that the streets of Mexico City are mostly covered by flexible pavement, which is composed of six layers of materials, of which the last three involve asphalt.
Among the most superficial layers is the asphalt carpet, made up of small stones bathed in asphalt and then compacted.
Each of the pebbles that make up the folder, he noted, is bathed in asphalt.
By passing the vehicles and generating forces, it allows the forces to be diffused very well on the pavement.
If it were modified asphalt, they would spread even better, the chemical engineer opined.
Above the asphalt carpet, it abounded, a last layer called rolling carpet is placed, which is made of a material of fine stone, that is, a sand that also bathes in asphalt.
As this is the layer that will be in contact with the tires of the vehicles, it must have more mechanical strength than the asphalt carpet and provide friction on the road.
As the part of the pavement that will receive and spread the forces, the rolling carpet also requires to have the appropriate thickness and the material of which it is made must be taken care of.
Climate, especially humidity and temperature variations, are also a very important factor to consider, especially water, he said, because it considerably affects the performance of the asphalt folder.
When the ground becomes wet, water diffuses into the interior of the carpet and is difficult to get out, this causes softening of all the layers of the pavement and, therefore, the formation of potholes.
In the process of forming a pothole, he said, the first to wear out is the bearing film and only afterwards is the asphalt carpet affected, but the damage does not happen instantly, but is a process that should be addressed at the first signals with appropriate maintenance programmes.
He also explained that vehicle load is another important factor in the formation of potholes and, therefore, the thickness of each of the pavement layers should always be in relation to vehicle load and ensure that it is met, to avoid frequent potholes.
Rafael Herrera warned that there is still much to be investigated and worked on the asphalt, for example, asphalt emulsions, which in other countries are already even on the market and allow to repair the bores easily and without the need to use high temperatures.
What did the candidate from the Valley need to be the new Miss Colombia?
Analysis of the factors that influenced that Melina Ramírez Serna did not reach the crown of Señorita Colombia.
The Valley receives its 14th princess title.
Once again the Cauca Valley is left with the desire for the crown of Miss Colombia.
This time Melina Ramirez Serna had to settle for being on the podium of winners, wearing the silver crown and the band that accredit her as the new princess of Colombia.
The result obtained last night in Cartagena, where Miss Atlántico rose with the crown and the sceptre, the department already adds 14 titles of Princess and Melina joins the legion of Vallecaucan women who have been close to the crown but who were proclaimed princesses among them Miriam Ospina Benoit (1947), Clara Domínguez Borrero (1949), Patricia Bellini Ayala (1979), Lorena Álvarez (1981), Rose Mary Alzate (1983), María Olga Arenas (1987), Leila Blanque (1988), Mónica Evers (1989), María Consuela Pinedo (1990), Isabel Romero (1993), Giselle Garcés Aljure (2000), Diana Giralina (2007), Stephanie Garcés Aljure (2008).
Today the big question that many ask themselves is what was missing?
Because the result represents the defeat of a great favorite who in each presentation showed that she had everything to be the new Miss Colombia, not in vain was elected Queen of the Police and Best Face Jolie of Vogue, titles that got queens like Taliana Vargas or Natalia Navarro who took the Miss Colombia crown.
The first factor that is considered key in the decision that the jury took to designate the First Princess lies in that it did not convince with his answer to the question "What is that book that has marked you and why? made by Martín Murillo Gómez, of the Carreta Literaria Leamos.
To the questioner the caucasian replied:
"I read a lot, I believe quite a lot in literature, I think it is a way of becoming cultured, I definitely think the book that marked me as a child is "The Little Prince", it is a rather profound book.
I am currently reading "Crime and Punishment", a book of universal literature that we all should read; and today I am reading the book by Irene Nemirovski, a Russian, a beautiful book called "The Ardor of Blood".
A response that was disliked first for the term "culturally" and second for not explaining in a concrete way how each of the books he cited have marked it.
But at the end of the ceremony Melina expressed feeling calm and happy with the result "the universe is wise passes what has to happen.
And for all of you, please read a little, "The Little Prince" is a great book".
Among the hypotheses put forward, it is said that Valle was burned by favoritism.
A Bogotá journalist insinuated that being the favorite, the ovated and the candidate who took all the preliminary awards (gastronomy challenge Oster, public vote for the best artisanal costume, and Queen Mother), "that awakened the jealousy of the other candidates, stressed the queen and that's why she did not shine on the stage".
And that was evident in her first swimsuit performance at the Hilton beach and her two pageants on the eve of her coronation.
Although she looked confident in both, it was noted that she lacked the strength and impetus that the representatives of Magdalena and Atlántico did show.
Ariel Osorio, a journalist on the RCN channel's "Como en casa" program, opined that the fact that Melina was designated a princess "proves that the candidate who wins the most awards during the competition does not stay as queen".
Besides, Valle was very evasive with the press, and he was wrong.
Another hypothesis is that Valle failed to convince the jury of her interest in social work, which is ultimately the essence of the National Beauty Contest.
For some reason, two days before the election, the international jury Lucy Doughty stated that they were looking for a woman committed to the social needs of her country.
"Beauty alone is not enough for a Miss Colombia, you have to look beyond the physical and focus on your social sensitivity, that before entering the Competition are already involved in projects", she explained.
It is also speculated that Valle sinned because of her defects in the derriere and the fibrosis that was noted in her abdomen, but it is contradictory because precisely the jury chose her as the candidate 'Natural Beauty' with the healthiest body, good food and responsible physical work.
The queen trainer Jorge Hernán Orozco recognizes that Melina did not have the best body, that there were better, "but her problem of fibrosis in the abdomen, which the truth for me was not very notorious, she dropped points on the last day".
Meanwhile, journalist Guido Hoyos of the magazine Cromos believes that the error of the Caucasian valley was the surgical interventions that were practiced.
"The surgeries are fine, but Valle didn't know how to do them.
Her body was never her strong suit and here she was taken".
For this award, which for the first time gives the National Competition of Beauty, after the parade in bathing suit arose a cruel vaticinio that last night was fulfilled, because it was said that this was the contentillo that Raymundo granted Melina not to give the taste of the crown.
Whether it's true or not, Melina is starting a year of reign, not as a sovereign, but as a princess, a position that gives her the possibility of representing Colombia in one of the international competitions by designation of the National Competition itself.
However, she will go down in history as one of the queens who, despite her sweeping passage through Cartagena, eluded the crown.
This was the work of the caretaker who identified the body of Alfonso Cano
A lofoscopist from Cali went down in history as the man who confirmed the death of "Alfonso Cano".
The work of these officials is key.
On November 4, a lofoscopist from the CTI in Cali went down in history as the man who confirmed the identity of the top FARC chief: "Alfonso Cano", through the comparison of his fingerprints.
Of the seven lofoscopists who work in the CTI section, that week Eliazar González, a man from Puerto Tejada who has been working in the area of judicial investigation for 21 years, was on duty.
At the beginning of his career, González worked in Chocó municipalities, where many times he had to intern for more than five days in the jungle to reach the site where the corpses were to be identified.
In 2000 he moved to the capital of the Valley and, after doing the corresponding courses, he specialized in lofoscopy, which is the study of the friction skin, that is, the palms of the hands and the feet.
The week of the operation against Alfonso Cano, Eliazar was warned to wear minimal clothing for three days.
Something big was waiting for him.
On Friday night he left for Cauca by helicopter from Palmira.
He knew that he had to identify two corpses and that one of them was suspected to be the man who led the oldest guerrilla in the world, so they asked him to carry the decadactilar card of Guillermo León Sáenz (his real name).
However, when he arrived with the investigation team at the site of the body, he did not recognize it by its physical appearance, as it was very different from what he had seen in the media.
He was beardless, dressed like a local peasant, without glasses and much thinner.
But the tracks don't lie.
Accompanied by a Galtonian magnifying glass, ink, a transplanter and a flashlight, Eliazar compared the fingerprints of the corpse with those on the card.
His eye didn't fail him: it was "Alfonso Cano".
That same night, the Puerto Tejada man was in charge of confirming to the Minister of Defense, Juan Carlos Pinzón, that he was the top FARC leader.
In search of the footprint
For a dactyloscopist from Sijín de Cali, the recognition that President Juan Manuel Santos gave to Eliazar González, in the press conference for the operation against "Cano", is very significant.
A lot of people don't know our work.
Fingerprinting is an exact science, with no margin for error, that can become the key to solving crimes.
Apart from identifying dead bodies, lofoscopists support investigations into crimes such as robbery and murder and confirm the identity of captured persons.
When caught, many criminals present false ID cards or are undocumented.
We take their fingerprints and run them through the database.
The investigator said that in one case of theft, he had to remove a piece of the wall of a house, because the thief had put his hand on it to take out a safe full of jewels and money.
"The walls are difficult because they are not suitable surfaces to take a fingerprint, but in that case we were able to obtain the imprint of the whole hand and identify the offender, who had participated in different robberies", he recalled.
Footprints can also rule out or reassert suspects in homicide cases.
A man was found dead recently, with liquor bottles all around him.
Through investigation, it was determined that a relative could be a suspect in the crime, and indeed, a fingerprint on the bottle matched.
While this doesn't guarantee that he was the killer, it does place him at the crime scene.
A CTI fingerprint specialist explained that "the fingerprints are removed with chemical or physical reagents" on the objects.
When they do appear, a transplanter or tape is used to lift them.
After this, the prints are sent to the Asif, which is the criminal database, or to the Registrar.
"The problem is that there are still many undocumented Colombians", said the CTI expert.
He made it clear that not everything is as shown on the television show CSI.
Just as all that glitters is not gold, not everything that is touched becomes a fingerprint.
However, if it can be used, if the respective comparison is made.
The "indignados" defy authorities in New York
Hundreds of protesters were gathering in front of Zuccotti Square to camp.
A large number of them complied with the eviction order and moved to a nearby parish.
Members of the Occupy Wall Street movement defied the New York authorities on Tuesday by trying to re-enter, under the protection of a court order, the Manhattan square from which they were evicted at dawn and by trying to occupy another park in the Big Apple.
Hundreds of protesters were gathering in front of Zuccotti Square, where they wanted to access thanks to a court order that allows the "indignados" to camp in the place, while another part of the movement responded to the eviction by occupying a park further north of the city, where there have been new arrests.
"Our idea is that if the court doesn't allow us to camp in the square again, we will settle somewhere else and continue the legal battle to get back to Zuccotti, as well as through sit-ins and peaceful demonstrations", said one of the spokesmen for the Occupy Wall Street movement, Mark Bray.
Bray said that the "indignant" response to the eviction of their camp dictated personally by New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg reached the courts, where Judge Lucy Billings issued an order prohibiting the forced evacuation of the place and allowing the protesters to remain encamped.
In addition, the "indignados" proceeded to occupy a new park located at the junction of the central Canal Street and Sixth Avenue, very close to the entrance to the Holland tunnel, which connects New York and New Jersey, and owned by the parish of Trinity Church.
At least for an hour they managed to occupy the place, but then the Police came and proceeded to arrest some of the protesters, although Bray could not confirm the specific figure, while he assured Efe that he saw several journalists who were also handcuffed.
The organization says that several hundred people had settled at that point, where a delegation of religious leaders had already moved in support of the members of the movement and tried to mediate with the Police.
Meanwhile, the Zuccotti square - which is a private property - remains closed pending a court hearing scheduled for this Tuesday in which the legality of the evacuation of this morning must be analyzed.
Some of the protesters who were displaced there carried and distributed copies of that judicial order at this time and even handed them to the agents guarding the square, which caused "some small clashes", Bray said, who denounced that some officers struck at the protesters.
The court order forbids the authorities to evict members of Occupy Wall Street or to apply "laws that were issued after the occupation began or to prohibit the protesters from re-entering the park with shops or other properties they used previously".
Mayor Bloomberg told the press that because of the court order, the city had suspended the reopening of the space to the public and the protesters, whom he warned, however, that local laws do not allow them to re-install with tents and sleeping bags.
The councillor personally defended the early morning eviction of Zuccotti square, an operation in which about 200 arrests were made and which was decided because the protesters were "violating the law".
Bloomberg explained that he gave the order to evacuate the square because it was becoming "a place where people didn't come to protest, but to break the law and, in some cases, to harm other people", as "some businesses had received threats" and residents feared "for their quality of life".
"The eviction this morning was disgusting and shows that at the bottom Bloomberg is more interested in preserving the financial interests than those of American workers", added the movement spokesman, who accused the mayor of "lacking respect for freedom of expression".
The "Occupy Wall Street" officials also indicated that they plan to organize "great actions" for Thursday in collaboration with community organizations and unions, to commemorate the two months of protests, which began on September 17.
Pamela Anderson will play the Virgin Mary in a Christmas special on TV.
Along with Michael Bublé and other prominent Canadians, he will appear on the television show "It's a Russell Peters Christmas" on December 1st.
Canadian Pamela Anderson has been Tim Allen's assistant on "Home Improvement", lifeguard on "Baywatch", Playboy bunny, the wife of rock musician Tommy Lee and now, the actress and model will be the Virgin Mary in a Canadian television Christmas special.
The private television channel CTV announced today that Anderson, along with crooner Michael Bublé and other prominent Canadians, will appear on the television program "It's a Russell Peters Christmas" on December 1st, giving life to a very special Virgin Mary.
CTV today released footage of the television show in which Anderson, also known for the wide distribution of a pornographic home video on the internet in which she appears along with her then-husband, Mötley Crüe drummer Tommy Lee, is dressed as the Virgin Mary holding in a crib a doll that represents Jesus.
In the scene, Peters, a well-known Canadian comedian of Indian origin who recently served as host for part of Charlie Sheen's "My Violent Torpedo of Truth" tour, appears as Joseph.
In addition to Anderson and Peters, the CTV Christmas special features Canadian singer Bublé, who in late March married Argentine model Luisana Lopilato in Buenos Aires, and who is no stranger to controversy.
Bublé recently called American Kim Kardashian a "bitch" during one of his concerts in New York.
Japan rebounds after earthquake
GDP grows by 1.5% thanks to domestic consumption and ends the downward spiral that began in March
Since last March, the Japanese economy has been paralysed, still recovering from the devastating earthquake that turned into a nuclear crisis, the worst catastrophe that the Japanese country has suffered since World War II.
The first estimates of the Tokyo government put the material losses at $300 billion, a blow that, despite the difficult world context, seems to have subsided.
After three consecutive quarters of declines, the Gross Domestic Product data between July and September served to turn the page, definitively: GDP increased by 1.5% compared to the previous quarter and 6% in annualized rate.
The second quarter - for the Japanese, the fiscal year starts in March 2012 - also saw the fastest growth rate since January to March 2010.
The recovery is explained, in part, by the uptick in the purchase of machinery to restore areas devastated by the earthquake and subsequent tsunami.
In fact, firms increased their investments by 1.1%, compared to the 0.9% decline in capital expenditure observed from January to March, the first reversal after six months of uninterrupted increases.
However, the real upturn in the Japanese economy is not based solely on the Keynesian impulse to take advantage of crises to strengthen - or rebuild - infrastructures, to use shortcomings to grow from scratch.
Japan has awakened, above all, thanks to the evolution of domestic consumption, which now represents 60% of Japanese GDP.
This variable climbed 1%, driven by increased spending on vehicles, travel and leisure activities.
The stigma of the yen
Tokyo has been entrusted to the domestic market, while the yen - the Japanese currency - has become one of the 'safe haven' assets chosen by investors fleeing the eurozone debt crisis and the murky prospects for the US, a privilege that weighs like a stone on the accounts of exporting companies.
With a stronger currency, products are more expensive abroad, a serious setback for a country whose economic float line is determined by the health of the big technology groups.
Toyota and Sony, for example, attributed their weak results between July and September to the yen's price.
As markets continue their siege of the peripheral EU countries, the government of Yoshihiko Noda is not letting down its guard.
"We must be alert to the risks that persist, such as the deterioration of some foreign economies, the impact of the floods in Thailand and the rapid appreciation of the yen", said yesterday the State Secretary for Economic Policy, Motohisa Furukawa.
And indeed, the prospects are not encouraging.
The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) said that most member countries showed clearer signs of economic slowdown in September.
The indicator anticipating the turning points in the world economy highlighted that the major powers are slowing down.
It's already down four tenths to 100.4 points, compared to 100.8 in August.
The euro zone even fell below the average, which is at level 100, by eight tenths to 99.13 points.
Athens is fuelling doubts again
Papadimos says the adjustments will pass, but the Tories won't sign any written commitments.
With peripheral risk premiums soaring and uncertainty re-established in the parishes, Greece continues to tangle in the maze that leads to the exit from the great European debt crisis.
The feeling that the 'consensus' of the new Greek transitional government is imposed more by the demands of Brussels than by genuine persuasion of the political forces is beginning to be confirmed by facts.
While the new Prime Minister, Lukas Papadimos, warned yesterday that there is no alternative to structural reforms and that the 100-day period agreed upon in his appointment may be short to implement them, the leader of the conservative New Democracy party, Antonis Samaras, assured that he will not support new austerity measures in any case and reiterated his demand for new elections for the scheduled date, February 19.
"The main task of this Government is to implement the decisions of the 26 October summit", Papadimos said as he opened a parliamentary debate which will culminate tomorrow with a vote of confidence in the new Executive.
A package of 24 programmes to boost employment, reform of the disciplinary code for civil servants and new measures against tax evasion will be the first initiatives.
However, Samaras's message does not remove doubts about his position: "We have committed ourselves to help the transitional government, but we have not committed ourselves to anything else".
The conservative leader took a step further in his pulse at the EU and the IMF, the bodies that must unlock the 8 billion Athens urgently needs, and made it clear that he will not give his blessing to any letter of commitment to compliance with the adjustments.
The European Commission, however, still reeling from the shock of the Papandreou referendum, reiterated yesterday that its demand is firm: it will not unblock aid unless the new government and the leaders of the main Greek parties sign "a written commitment without ambiguity and as soon as possible".
The spokesman for Economic Affairs, Amadeu Altafaj, explained that the troika inspectors will return "very soon" to Athens to discuss with the new government "what is needed to pay the sixth tranche" of 8.000 million, although there is no definitive date either.
The Greek mat is still made for the weather.
Doña Sofía: "They are instruments for progress and hope"
The Queen highlights Spain's "preponderant" position in relation to this type of finance
Spain "has achieved a leading position in the world in the role of microfinance".
Queen Doña Sofía recalled yesterday that the country has become the second largest donor to the planet in the last two decades in relation to this cooperation instrument, whose "essence" she said is to be an "instrument for social progress, justice and the hope of a better future for all humanity, based on trust in the human being".
The Queen inaugurated yesterday the V World Summit of Micro-credit in Valladolid with the conviction that "there is no doubt" that this type of operations are "absolutely indispensable" to achieve the Millennium Goals established by the United Nations with a horizon of 2015, and, "especially, in that which has as its goal the reduction to half the volume of people living on incomes below a dollar a day, with which the "poverty threshold" is fixed.
Spain "continues to work" to expand the network of beneficiaries "to all corners of the planet, and takes on this task with "responsibility", said Doña Sofía, who hoped that the initiatives and contributions that originate in the Summit, which will last until Thursday, "guarantee the creation of new capacities and better opportunities for the poorest, and especially for women", the main beneficiaries of these loans.
There are "many achievements" and "many challenges facing us".
The Microfinance Summit is not only a forum for debate, but also a platform from which to promote "two basic goals".
The aim is to have 175 million poor families accessing these financial services by the end of 2015 and to have 100 million of these households lifted out of poverty.
The impetus for the conception of microcredits in Spain and the rest of the world "has followed the path pioneered years ago" by Muhammad Yunus, Doña Sofía stressed as an "act of justice and due recognition".
He described the father of this tool as an "admirable idealist in the universal cause of the fight against poverty", whose work he has known for 15 years, when the Queen travelled to Bangladesh to learn on the ground about its lending policy.
This experience was followed a year later by the first World Summit in Washington and other meetings such as those held in Ivory Coast in 1999, Canada 2006, and "I have been able to see continuous evolution in all of them", explained His Majesty, whose link with this project earned him yesterday the title of "head of the family" gathered in Valladolid by the "backer of the poor".
Finally, Queen Doña Sofía concluded her speech by encouraging those present to take part in the debate and in the search for solutions to make progress in the fight against poverty.
"Ethical imperative"
The Minister of Foreign Affairs, Trinidad Jiménez, warned that solidarity "is an ethical imperative" for every democratic state.
The European Parliament has also called for the Commission to take the necessary steps to ensure that the EU's financial and technical assistance is used to support the development of the countries of the region.
The Commissioner said that the European Union had a clear policy on the use of micro-credit to combat poverty and that the governments of developed countries should work on the basis of solidarity and not allow the poor to fall victim to the cuts.
For Spain, microcredit is "one of the main lines of development cooperation".
For her part, the Secretary of State for International Cooperation, Soraya Rodríguez, applauded "the success" of giving "confidence" to people "excluded to whom everyone closes the doors"; and the mayor of Valladolid, Francisco Javier León de la Riva, welcomed those present to a city that "opens its doors infected with the spirit of solidarity".
The CDU proposes to elect the European President by universal suffrage
The first day of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) congress in Leipzig on Monday 14 November went very smoothly for Chancellor Angela Merkel, the chairwoman of the Christian Democratic Party.
The future of Europe was not initially on the agenda, but the issue was imposed in autumn, in particular to satisfy the militants who believe that the government's policy is currently too lax with the Greeks and could be in the future with the Italians.
The motion on the Presidency of the European Commission, proposed by the management, was adopted almost unanimously.
Of the 1,001 delegates, only nine voted against and ten abstained.
The standing ovation of several minutes, won by Angela Merkel and, after several hours, by Wolfgang Schäuble, the Euro-friendly Finance Minister, cleared up any possible doubts.
The key idea of the Chancellor, and of the motion, is summed up in a slogan: the response to the crisis is "not less Europe, but more Europe".
Not only because Europe is peace, but also because 'nine million jobs depend directly on the euro'.
The Chancellor said that 'the time has come to break through in Europe'.
This could be expressed in changes to the Lisbon Treaty to allow for greater control by the European Union over the budgetary policies of the euro area countries, but could also lead to the election of the President of the European Commission by universal suffrage to "give a face to Europe".
In any event, that is one of the proposals in the motion adopted by the Congress, clearly the idea of Wolfgang Schäuble.
It is doubtful that the 27 will be able to agree quickly on this radical change: Britain is hostile to him and the CDU leaders seem to know that Nicolas Sarkozy is hostile to him.
But the ball is on the field.
The delegates also rejected by an overwhelming majority the proposal to weight each country's share of the European Central Bank's directive according to the weight of each economy, which would clearly strengthen Germany's share.
The Chancellor, anxious to calm the mood within her party, has increased references to Konrad Adenauer and Helmut Kohl, but it is not as if she has tried to win her congress at the expense of the 'small' European countries or the countries in difficulty ready to criticise the arrogant Germany.
Although the motion on Europe devotes a section to the importance of 'the Franco-German friendship', Angela Merkel has not mentioned France.
Except in passing.
Two centuries ago, a bloody battle took place in Leipzig.
In fact, it was one of the most humiliating defeats for Napoleon's army.
The incidence of fraud in sick leave
After the subsidies, the UMP and the government launched an offensive against sick leave.
Nicolas Sarkozy will be in Bordeaux on Tuesday, November 15 to visit a family allowance fund and to give a speech on the subject, which has been recurring since 2007, of the fight against social fraud and the aid.
Moreover, to accompany this offensive, which starts from the desire to save in a rigorous way, but still recalls an axis of the right-wing presidential campaign, most want to focus on sick leave.
First, to implement budget cuts: the government plans to impose a fourth day of absence on private sector workers before they can take leave.
In short, unless there is a specific company agreement, a worker who falls ill would lose four days of salary, that is, a minimum of 15% of his monthly income.
This is a measure that could raise a wave of anger, but would save 280 million euros, according to Les Echos.
In addition, it would be accompanied by another measure with a more symbolic scope: imposing on officials one day of absence without pay in case of absence from work (so far, they have no absence, compared to the three days applied in the private sector).
While these issues are being debated, most of them also bring the issue of fraud back on the table, this time with a focus on the abuse of the workers' wages.
"The checks will be increased considerably and, in addition, if someone is found to be committing fraud, he will have to reimburse the amounts", Xavier Bertrand warned on RTL on Sunday, November 13.
As in the other cases, the effects of the advertisement appear to be slightly out of proportion to the reality of the layoffs fraud.
In fact, since 2002 this issue has been constantly monitored and various political offensives have been launched which have usually borne fruit.
The French are no more sick than the rest of Europe.
Let us look carefully at the national figures first.
According to the French Social Security Institute (CNAM), over EUR 237 million in unemployment benefits were paid in 2006.
According to the French Institute for Research and Documentation in Health Economics, in 2008, the subsidies for dismissals represented 5% of health expenditure, amounting to 11.3 billion euros.
Of this sum, 46% is due to maternity leave and work-related injury, while 54% is due to sick leave, amounting to EUR 6.2 billion.
So 2.5% of health expenditure.
In 2010, the French took an average of 14.5 days off from work, compared to 17.8 in 2009, according to a study by the Alma Consulting group.
This average is undoubtedly misleading: another survey, published in 2007 by the Syrian professional management company Monster.com, showed that 75% of the 40,000 French employees surveyed claimed that they had not taken a single day of sick leave.
Another study, in this case by the Assurance maladie, indicates that in 2010 37% of sick leave was of less than 8 days, 22% of 8 to 14 days, 15% of 15 days to one month, 15% of one to three months and 11% were longer.
Compared with our European neighbours, French workers are no more likely than workers in other areas to be made redundant because of ill health.
A long-term study conducted in 2010 by two CNRS researchers indicated that between 1994 and 2001, the overall rate of absenteeism from work (both for health and other reasons) ranged from 10% to 11% in France, compared with 20% to 28% in Denmark, 15% in the United Kingdom and 16% to 18% in the Netherlands.
Fraud in sick leave is not particularly significant compared to undeclared work.
The fraud is rather limited in scope.
The strengthening of legislation since 2002 has led to systematic checks on sick leave of more than 45 days.
In 2008, of 1.5 million inspections, the CNAM found that short-term layoffs were "unjustified or too long" in 13% of the 285,000 carried out, i.e. 37,050 cases.
In the case of casualties of more than 45 days, which were subjected to systematic inspections, 11% of the cases were found to be "wrongly adapted or unjustified; a figure which, taking a total of 1.2 million as a starting point, amounts to 132,000.
This brings the total number of 'unjustified' cases to 169 000 among several million workers who took sick leave.
This is certainly a small amount compared with, say, working in the dark.
According to UMP MP Dominique Tian, who authored a report on this issue in June, this practice would represent a loss of tax revenue of between 9 and 15 billion euros per year, i.e. more than the total cost of subsidies for casualties and, without a doubt, considerably more than fraud in the latter area.
Papademos: Greece will have to implement a new adjustment plan
Greece will need a new adjustment plan to get its economy back on its feet.
This is what Prime Minister Lucas Papademos said to Parliament on Monday, 14 November, adding that the 100 days granted to his Union Government would not be enough to achieve this objective.
"To make efforts to bring the economy back to normal, we need the support of our European partners and a new budgetary adjustment programme", declared the Head of Government, who was giving his first public speech during the opening of the vote of confidence debate in Parliament on Wednesday.
The implementation of the decisions adopted at the euro-area summit on 27 October will be the "main task" of the new government, as the country's continued membership of the euro area "is at stake", he added.
As a result, Papademos has forecast that the country's public deficit will be reduced to 'around 9%' of GDP before the end of the year, after reaching 10.6% in 2010 and 15.7% in 2009.
The right rejects new austerity measures
Antonis Samaras, the head of the right-wing group, showed his support on Monday for the measures already approved to try to get out of the debt crisis, but has warned that his party will not commit to additional austerity measures.
"We will not vote in favour of new measures", he said during a meeting with deputies from his New Democracy party.
He said he was in favour of the objectives of reducing the deficit and debt and of fighting waste, but against any policy that would impede economic recovery.
The European Commissioner for Economic and Monetary Affairs, Olli Rehn, who warned that the IMF and the EU would not release the necessary €8 billion loan without a written guarantee of support from all parties to the measures envisaged, was replied by Antonio Samaras that his word would be enough and that he would not sign anything because of external pressure.
A panel of experts says euthanasia and assisted suicide should be legalized
Canadians live in denial of death, according to the Royal Society of Canada report
The Committee calls for governments, health care institutions and doctors to work together to ensure the best possible palliative care, not just for cancer.
Canadian society lives in denial of death.
In fact, only 9% of Canadians are willing to talk to their doctor about the conditions in which they want to die and make arrangements to do so.
This is one of the conclusions of a major report by the Royal Society of Canada, which included six experts from various fields, including ethics, law, and medicine.
This committee recommends that the Government amend the Criminal Code so that assisted suicide and euthanasia are allowed, when the patient is faced with such an option and has been judged competent to make the decision.
To begin with, the experts cite a recent survey by the Economist Intelligence Unit that compared the quality of death in 40 countries around the world.
Although Canada ranks tenth, the study notes that "the medicalization of death in Canada has created a culture in which people are afraid to deal with the subject of death".
With or without medication, 77 percent of Canadians do not have access to palliative care, according to experts selected by the Royal Society of Canada.
And, although most Canadians wish to die at home, 68.6 percent of them end up dying in the hospital.
Overall, Quebec has the highest rate of hospital-related deaths, with 86% of deaths occurring in hospitals.
As regards the sensitive issue of euthanasia and assisted suicide, the authors of the report reached conclusions which do not coincide with the position of the Federal Government, which has already stated that it does not wish to amend the Criminal Code in relation to euthanasia and assisted suicide.
However, according to the experts, who have also studied the situation in all countries where such practices have been legalized or do not constitute a criminal offence, there is no evidence that the fact that they are not considered a criminal offence has not led to an abuse of their application, i.e. the use of euthanasia or assisted suicide with incompetent persons or those who have not given their consent.
The report also calls for the adoption of a new law on the protection of the environment, which will be applied to all the countries of the European Union.
"In Canada, euthanasia is practiced, although it is clearly illegal".
"Assisted suicide is a common practice in Canada, although it is clearly illegal", explains Jocelyn Downie.
Canadians in favour of euthanasia
Recall that 85% of Canadians have already spoken out in favor of euthanasia, since they believe that it would allow people whose death is imminent to alleviate their suffering, according to a survey by Angus Reid conducted in 2010.
Furthermore, 66 percent believe that legalizing euthanasia will not mean that the lives of the elderly or the disabled are less valuable.
As for those who have committed assisted suicide, 41% of the respondents think that no legal proceedings should be initiated against them.
The situation is not so clear as regards the maintenance or interruption of the health care of a patient, according to the authors of the report.
In addition, among its recommendations, it suggests that the withdrawal of health care, if legally refused, should not be a criminal offence.
The Committee of Experts also calls for health professionals to be trained in the duty to respect the fact that a patient refuses care at the end of his life without fear of facing a complaint.
On palliative care, the committee calls for governments, health care institutions and doctors to work together to ensure the best palliative care, and not just for cancer.
The Committee also calls for the introduction of a new system of health insurance for the elderly, which would be a new system for the elderly.
Other experts express reservations
Other experts in the field of health law have already expressed their reservations regarding the findings of the Royal Society of Canada experts' report.
Pierre Deschamps, a specialist in health law, has described the position of the experts who signed the report as "extreme", not least because the practice of euthanasia is not limited to terminally ill patients.
"This leaves the door open to a situation where someone who is tired of living and is over 18 years old can ask for help to commit suicide", says Deschamps, who consulted a summary of the report yesterday.
Mr Deschamps also points out that the authors of the report seem to give priority to personal autonomy over any other value in society.
But, he adds, "in society, there are labels and limitations".
Health law expert Margaret Somerville also expressed her "strong opposition" to the report's conclusions, which she called a "manifesto in favor of euthanasia".
Margaret Somerville, who is also a member of the Royal Society of Canada, particularly challenges the lack of abuse in certain countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide are legal, such as the Netherlands and Oregon.
The King of Jordan urges President Assad to step down
Damascus denounces a "plot" by the Syrian government
Syria is increasingly isolated
Bashar El Asad supporters demonstrated yesterday in front of the Foreign Ministry building.
Yesterday, diplomatic pressure on Syria by Bashar El Asad, who with the support of Russia is resisting it, intensified and denounced that there is a "conspiracy" against the country.
Two days after the Arab League suspended Syria, the European Union has tightened sanctions against Damascus, while Turkey and Jordan, Syria's neighbours, have spoken out in favour of President Assad's departure from power.
King Abdullah II of Jordan was yesterday the first Arab leader to ask President Bashar El Asad to "abandon power" in Syria, where some forty civilians and members of the regime's forces have already died.
"If Bashar really cares about his country, he should resign, and create the conditions for a new phase in Syrian political life", the king of Jordan, Syria's neighbor, said in an interview with the BBC.
The European Union is also calling for a new round of talks with Turkey to be held in the coming days.
"Those who are not at peace in the Middle East with their people and cannot satisfy them will leave", he said, referring to Syria, a neighbouring country with which Turkey is taking an increasingly hard line.
The European Union has also expressed its support for the efforts of the United States to bring the situation under control.
"The international community, the United States, the EU, the Arab League and other countries, such as Turkey, are taking a harder line" on the Syrian crackdown, says State Department spokesman Mark Toner.
Meanwhile, 16 civilians and at least 19 members of the regime's forces have already been killed in the Deraa region in southern Syria, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR) has announced.
The UN has also called for the immediate release of the remaining civilians, including the hostages, who were held in detention.
Syrian Foreign Minister Walid Al Mualem, speaking to the press, said that the country was "moving towards the end of the crisis".
It also strongly reacted to the Arab League's decision to suspend Damascus from its functions, which it considered to be "a dangerous step".
"Syria will not falter", he added, guaranteeing that "the plots against Syria will fail".
Following the decision to suspend Syria, the Arab League is currently studying a 'mechanism for the protection of civilians' and wishes to send 500 members of Arab human rights organisations, media and military observers to the country.
The French Foreign Minister, Alain Juppé, has also expressed his support for the deployment of UN observers to help protect civilians from repression by the regime which, in his view, is locked in "paranoia".
A new extraordinary League meeting is scheduled to be held in Rabat tomorrow to finalise the implementation of the crisis plan adopted on 2 November, which provides in particular for the withdrawal of the armed forces from opposition-held towns and the release of detained protesters.
The Russian Foreign Minister, Serguei Lavrov, yesterday judged the decision of the Arab League as "incorrect", while China urged Syria to implement the plan to get out of the crisis, although it did not express its support for the application of possible sanctions against Damascus.
The
Monti asks for time for markets and sacrifices for Italians
The future head of the Italian government, Mario Monti, has asked for some time from the markets to form his team and to launch a programme that will include "sacrifices" aimed at regaining the credibility lost during the last months of the Berlusconi government.
The former European Commissioner had talks with the political parties yesterday and met with the trade unions and employers' organizations today.
He would have to form a relatively small cabinet, composed of technocrats outside Parliament.
'Monti has spoken of a broad programme with many sacrifices,' said Francesco Nucara, a member of one of the many small parliamentary groups taking part in the meetings, after meeting the President-elect of the Council.
The House of Representatives President, Gianfranco Fini, said he hoped that Mario Monti would request a vote of confidence in Parliament before Friday to ensure that the new government had sufficient support.
The consultations will end with Mr Monti presenting a limited list, no doubt of a dozen Ministers, to the Head of State, Giorgio Napolitano.
Monti commented on the nervousness of the stock markets and bondholders yesterday, asking for time.
The Commission has also been asked to present a report on the implementation of the new rules on the protection of the environment.
His appointment by the President was initially welcomed by the markets, but later became a cause for concern, in particular after an unforeseen fall in industrial production in the euro area in September.
The appointed Prime Minister should create a team made up mainly of technocrats, even if he has stressed that he would like to include "politicians".
The new government should function until 2013, the date of the next legislative elections, he believes.
According to the President of the Chamber of Deputies, Gianfranco Fini, the new government will obtain the vote of confidence of the Parliament before Friday.
Monti has pledged that when he takes office he will work with urgency and with the aim of Italy "reclaiming its leading role" in Europe.
A spokesman for European Commissioner Olli Rehn stressed that 'even with a new government, our diagnosis of the Italian economy will not change'.
The EU, convinced that Rome will not achieve its budget balance target in 2013 despite the austerity plans adopted during the last months, has called for the adoption of new austerity measures.
The Commission is also proposing to extend the scope of the directive to include the use of the term 'common carrier' in the scope of the directive.
Monti, renowned for his competence and independence as European Commissioner (1994-2004), represents a 'change of era' for Italy after 17 years of 'berlusconism'; the 'professor' is a symbol of 'the challenge of seriousness' and 'another Italy', say the editors.
The big unknown will be the longevity of your team.
President Napolitano wants to avoid early elections, as Italy has to put about 200 billion euros in state bonds before April 2012.
Russian scientist has collaborated with the Iranian nuclear program
A Russian scientist, Vycheslav Danilenko, has collaborated with Iran in developing a detonator that can be used with a nuclear weapon, an American NGO specializing in atomic risk said on Monday.
For the identification of the researcher, the Institute for International Science and Security (ISIS) is based on a recent report of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and other documents issued by the UN agency.
The IAEA last week expressed "grave concern" about a "possible military dimension" of Iran's nuclear programme.
According to ISIS, based largely on IAEA documents, Danilenko, born in 1934, worked for three decades, since the 1960s, in a Soviet military nuclear facility in Cheliabinsk (Ural) and participated in the manufacture of synthetic exploding diamonds.
In 1989 or 1991, he would have left the center to form a company focused on the production of "nanodiamonds" in Kiev.
The financial problems of his company would have led him to contact, in 1995, the Iranian Embassy in Ukraine.
He was later believed to have cooperated with the Iranian program between 1996 and 2002, before returning to Russia.
In its latest report, the IAEA mentions that there are "clear indications that Iran is developing" a nuclear detonation system "with the help of a foreign expert, who not only had a good knowledge of the technique, but also, as one member state has informed the Agency, worked for most of his career on such technology in the military nuclear program of his home country".
Crimes and crimes against Muslims have increased by 50%
Crimes and crimes against Muslims have increased by nearly 50% between 2009 and 2010, while, in the same period, other types of racial and religious violence have decreased or increased only slightly, according to statistics released by the FBI on Monday.
According to these figures, the total number of violent acts committed against Muslims has increased from 107 in 2009 to 160 in 2010, an increase of 49%, compared to a 13% increase in violent acts against Catholics, a 4% decrease in crimes against Jews and a 14% increase in the number of anti-religious crimes and crimes.
The total number of "hate crimes" has risen slightly to 6,628, of which 47.3 percent are due to racial differences and 20 percent to religious differences, according to the FBI.
"After a decline in 2009, it is worrying that this type of crime and offences have increased again", Human Rights First said. "The increase in acts of violence against Muslims is especially significant", the organization added in a statement.
"Human Rights First has long pointed out that violence against Muslims, as well as all types of hate crimes, should be considered a serious violation of human rights", adds Paul Legendre, an official of the organization.
"The US government can and should strive to end such abuses", he adds, noting that such efforts could include improving police reporting on "hate crimes".
The "hate crime" in American federal law was inherited from the civil rights era.
This legislation was passed after the death of Martin Luther King to punish acts of violence linked to race, color, religion, origin and, now, sexual orientation.
Twitter changes its platform and looks more like Facebook
The microblogging site Twitter changed the layout of its platform on Monday to allow its users, in particular, to observe the activity of the people they follow, which causes its service to look a bit more like Facebook.
A new "activity" tab and another called "name" tab allow you to follow more legibly and live the activity of other "Twittos", that is, those Internet users whose messages ("tweets") follow on the Internet or who follow you.
This allows you to know if they follow messages, if they subscribe to new accounts, if they rate a message as a favorite, etc.
Twitter's new formula was tested "with a small percentage of users in August" before being rolled out to the rest of the network on Monday, Twitter spokeswoman Carolyn Penner told AFP.
Twitter, which was known for its uninstinctive operation, with slightly esoteric terms (RT to forward a message from another person, followfriday pour recommander de suivre un autre utilisateur) faisant le bonheur des initiés, s'ouvre ainsi à un public plus large avec un maniement plus comparable à celui des réseaux grand public Facebook et Google+.
On the net, users have debated in a flurry of tweets with different opinions on the interest of this innovation.
"It is useless, invasive and too much like Facebook", writes @jemb123.
"The Activity feature is going to help me better track some elements of my Twitter stream", writes @dannykronstrom.

Introduction of a budgetary "golden rule" in the Constitution
The Social Democratic/Christian Democratic grand coalition government in power in Austria decided on Tuesday to include in the constitution a budgetary "gold rule" to reduce the public deficit and thus avoid a possible downgrade of Austria's sovereign rating by the credit rating agencies (triple A).
It was the Social Democrat Chancellor Werner Faymann himself who announced this decision after a Council of Ministers meeting, when the Austrian public debt reached 74.6%, a figure far above the 60% ceiling fixed by the Maastricht Treaty, but clearly below the debts of countries such as Italy, Greece or Spain.
"If Austria's solvency were reduced by just one level, from AAA to AA+, we would have to pay €3 billion more in interest each year", said Christian Democrat Deputy Foreign Minister Michael Spindelegger.
Austria is responding to a request from the Brussels Summit of euro area countries on 26 October last: the Heads of State and Government called for the reduction of the public deficit and the restoration of the balance of the public accounts to be included in the Constitution or in an equivalent law by the end of 2012.
The Austrian Government's scheme is similar to the 'German model', as Germany was the first European country to adopt this type of 'rule'.
Before 2017, the structural government deficit should decrease by 0,75% of gross domestic product (GDP) each year and, from 2017, the structural government deficit of the federal state should not exceed 0,35% of GDP each year, while the regional states, as well as the municipalities, should present balanced budgets.
The objective is to reduce public debt by 2020/2021 under the 60% criterion laid down by the Maastricht Treaty.
A strong yen
No threat of further intervention by the foreign exchange market
Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda warned on Tuesday that Japanese authorities would intervene in the exchange market again if the yen continued to rise.
"We will intervene, as we did last time, if we find that there is excessive volatility" in the yen exchange rate, Noda explained to the Senate.
On Tuesday, the yen rose to levels close to the all-time highs that were reached by the Japanese authorities on 31 October.
On that day, Tokyo massively sold yen for dollars to lower the value of the Japanese currency, which had just reached a new record since 1945 compared to the US currency.
But the yen has been rising steadily since then, fueled by purchases by investors who see it as a "safe haven" in these uncertain times of global economic slowdown and European debt crisis.
The dollar was trading below 77 yen on Tuesday and the euro fell below the symbolic 105 yen bar, reaching levels close to those that triggered the last intervention.
Before the financial crisis of 2008-2009, the dollar was trading at around 120 yen and the euro at over 160 yen.
This explosion in the Japanese currency is damaging to the archipelago's exports, as it makes Made in Japan products more expensive and reduces the value of the income earned abroad by Japanese companies when they convert it into the national currency.
"Japan is struggling to rebuild" after the March 11 earthquake and tsunami that devastated the Tohoku region (north-east), said Noda, who fears that the yen's rise in price will undermine the weak recovery.
The world's third largest economy recovered growth in the third quarter (1.5% compared to the previous quarter), for the first time in a year, thanks to an increase in exports and consumption of households affected by the catastrophe.
But the Prime Minister felt that the high level of the yen did not reflect "Japan's economic fundamentals".
Finance Minister Jun Azumi has called on the Bank of Japan (BoJ), which opened a two-day meeting of its Monetary Policy Council on Tuesday, to take all possible measures to weaken the yen.
However, the institution's Deputy Governor, Hirohide Yamaguchi, warned that the BoJ had already taken "the appropriate measures", implying that no further monetary flexibility should be expected on Wednesday.
During its last meeting in late October, the issuing institution increased its purchases of Treasury Notes by 5 trillion yen (€47 billion), bringing the threshold of funds it devotes to the acquisition of various financial securities to flood the liquidity market to 55 trillion yen (€519 billion).
The euro area:
The guys grow up, the bags flake
The risk of contagion from the debt crisis continues to weigh on European indices.
Despite the appointment of new Heads of Government in Greece and Italy, and better growth figures in France and Germany, rates in the weaker countries continue to rise.
Still concerned about the stability of the euro zone, European stock markets plunge a little further into the negative zone on Tuesday, November 15.
In Paris, at 10 o'clock, the CAC 40 loses 1.4% and stands at 3.064 points.
The Dax loses 0.4% in Frankfurt and 0.1% in London.
"In view of the new tensions in the borrowing yields of the most affected euro area states, stock markets around the world are still reaping some of their recent gains".
"Nervous investors are well aware of the risk of contagion", explains Terry Pratt, an institutional broker at IG Markets, quoted by Reuters.
The Tokyo Stock Exchange closed with a 0.7% drop, renewing market participants' concerns about Europe's ability to contain the debt crisis.
"Japan, like the rest of the world, has its eyes fixed on Europe and exchanges will continue to take place with a small margin of variation, so that investors will have no evidence that the situation has stabilised", says Mitsushige Akino, fund manager at Ichiyoshi Investment Management.
The re-emergence of concerns about the future of the euro area is affecting the single currency, which continues to fall on Tuesday.
The euro is still at its lowest level in a month and a half.
By 10 a.m., the European currency was worth $1.3570, a drop of 0.4%.
According to the brokers, it has lost value after Chancellor Angela Merkel's party, the CDU, which met at the Congress on Monday, adopted a motion that envisages, in particular, the option of a country in difficulty leaving the euro zone without leaving the European Union.
Italian and Spanish rates far exceed 6%
The credit rates in Italy and Spain remain at very worrying levels.
On Tuesday morning, the yield on Italian 10-year bonds was 6.85%, while Spanish bonds with the same maturity were offering 6.2%.
These tensions with regard to interest rates in the southern countries, but also in France, continue to fuel the fears of investors.
The future Italian Prime Minister, Mario Monti, has asked for time to improve the situation in Italy, which is in danger of suffocating under the weight of its debt.
The new Greek Prime Minister, Lucas Papademos, said that implementing the decisions taken at the euro-zone summit on 27 October would be his government's "main task".
Spain is in the spotlight of the markets, while legislative elections will be held there on Sunday.
The spread between 10-year bonds in Germany and Spain has reached a new all-time high.
Waiting for the euro area growth figures
Statistically, France recorded economic growth of 0.4% in the third quarter, a figure more favourable than the 0.3% forecast, driven by domestic consumption.
Insee, however, revised the second quarter's figure downwards, with a 0.1% reduction in gross domestic product (GDP) rather than stagnation.
Besides, the fourth quarter is the one that really worries economists.
Germany, on the other hand, recorded a growth of 0.5% over the same period.
The first forecasts for the euro area as a whole are due at 11 a.m., after the European Commission warned of the risk of a new recession.
Energy policy:
Facts must be worth more than dogmas.
If there is one subject which cannot be dealt with by taking short-term considerations or simply by thinking about emotions, it is energy policy.
The availability and cost of electricity directly influence the purchasing power and competitiveness of firms.
It is appropriate that an election should be the time to reflect on such issues and on the place of nuclear energy.
The debate will only be useful if it looks at the overall economic, social and environmental consequences of the proposed options.
The French must base their opinion on objective facts, on rational data.
Now that we're seven billion people on the planet, the demographic evolution will mean that electricity demand will double by 2050, unless a huge part of the world's population is deprived of a vital element.
At the same time, we must address the growing shortage of fossil resources to continue producing electricity continuously, not to mention the urgent need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to combat climate change, a topic that has disappeared from the ecological debate.
The Fukushima accident does not change any of these parameters.
Germany is therefore alone in its decision to abandon nuclear energy.
This is not the case in Belgium, which is obliged to find a source capable of replacing it, or in Switzerland, which is only interested in building state-of-the-art power stations.
On the other hand, the UK, Finland, Poland, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India and Brazil, to name a few, are moving forward with determination with their projects.
The United States, for its part, after Fukushima decided to add a unit to its park, resuming the construction of a power plant interrupted after the Three Mile Island accident.
The German model, based on renewable energy sources, is sometimes presented as an example, but the reality is the opposite.
The choice of Berlin will mean higher electricity prices, greater energy dependence on imported gas, particularly from Russia, and higher CO2 emissions from the construction of gas and coal power stations.
In a few months, the harmful effects will be noticeable.
The case of Denmark should be considered.
Europe's leader in the wind sector, from which it gets 30% of its electricity, it is also one of the largest users of coal and gas due to the intermittency of the wind; for this reason, its CO2 emissions and the price of its electricity are, respectively, 65% and 50% higher than the European average.
On the contrary, thanks to the consistency of our energy policy, our neighbours pay an electricity bill 40% higher than that of French households.
In a globalised economy, the cost of energy is a key factor in competitiveness and a guarantee of the maintenance of industrial productivity on the national territory, while French companies benefit from the cheapest electricity in Europe.
For that reason, any significant reduction in nuclear energy would mean a sharp rise in the price of electricity, which would undermine the realism of the wonderful statements about the re-industrialization of our country and the defence of our purchasing power.
This is a price which the vast majority of French people refuse to pay and, in fact, do not express any opposition in principle to this type of energy, as the polls show.
Let us remember that our country's energy policy has failed to build an industrial sector with 125,000 direct jobs and 410,000 indirect jobs.
Broadly export-oriented, it encompasses a galaxy of SMEs specialised in international markets and able to create non-relocatable jobs.
If France decided to abandon nuclear energy, it would mean the sacrifice of a large part of these SMEs and the loss of €6 billion of French exports of nuclear equipment and services every year.
What electrician would order an EPR designed to last 60 years when the manufacturer is scheduled to collapse?
To solve the nuclear power equation, one must admit that there is no miraculous source of electricity production, just as there is no diabolical source.
The development by Areva of low-emission CO2, nuclear and renewable solutions demonstrates the complementary nature of energy sources.
In the case of nuclear energy, it is essential to maintain the highest level of safety.
In France we have a safety authority which exercises strict and transparent control both over existing plants and over the construction of Flamanville.
Our teams, of recognized professionalism, are also obsessed with safety.
In half a century, the nuclear sector has suffered three major accidents.
Only one, Three Mile Island, was produced under normal operating conditions; it had no consequences for people or the environment.
The Chernobyl accident was caused by the design of the reactor and by unforgivable human error.
In Fukushima, some people seem to forget that the accident was due to two natural disasters of unprecedented scale, which killed tens of thousands of people.
The nuclear industry will learn from this accident, as it did from the two before it.
Thanks to these developments and to cooperation between the safety authorities and French and German operators and manufacturers, the EPR is designed to withstand such phenomena.
While all the electricity players who want to build a power station are studying it, the interruption of its construction in Flamanville would be a great gift for the competitors of Areva and EDF, since it would leave them free to take the lead in the inevitable development of the nuclear sector.
It is both necessary and legitimate to seek the best energy options for our country, but it would be irresponsible to let emotion, dogma and partisan maneuvering dominate a debate so important for the economic, social and financial situation of our country.
Immigration - a burden or an opportunity for the economy?
The immigration policy pursued by Nicolas Sarkozy has been criticized from various points of view: the saturation of the police, judicial and administrative services subject to the policy of figures, the compatibility of this policy with the self-proclaimed status of "country of human rights" of France.
More recently, it is the administrative harassment of foreign students that has jumped to the headlines, with the Minister of the Interior (see Libération newspaper of May 23) proclaiming from the past that France "does not need foreign talents, workers or waiters".
However, it is rarely analysed from an economic point of view.
The point is, on this issue, there is a lot of consensus between the left and the right.
On the right, Jacques Chirac set the tone by declaring in 1976 that "900,000 unemployed people should not be a problem for a country with nearly two million immigrant workers", while on the left, Michel Rocard set the tone by explaining that France "cannot take care of all the misery in the world" in 1990.
The only difference is the degree of generosity.
In 2005, both the left and the right shared the fear of invasion of the national territory by a crowd of Polish plumbers.
On both sides, immigrants are considered a burden to the French economy and society.
The only difference is in the degree of generosity with which they act towards immigrants.
The Commission's proposal is to be submitted to the Council by the end of the year.
This idea of immigration as a burden, a problem, may be electorally profitable, but economically it's very expensive.
As economists Ian Goldin and Geoffrey Cameron point out in a recent work summarising the latest knowledge on immigration (Exceptional People: How Migration Shaped Our World and Will Define Our Future, May 2011, Princeton University Press, 352 pp.), there is a broad consensus among specialists on the positive impact of migratory flows on economic growth, wages and employment in countries that receive immigrants.
Limiting immigration weakens growth and harms employment.
Fears about the impact of immigrants are based on the idea that immigrants can replace national workers, particularly low-skilled workers, by pushing for lower wages.
But experience shows that in reality immigrants are more complementary than substitutes for national workers and are mainly employed in sectors where there is a lack of employment.
Low-skilled immigrants work in sectors that do not attract national workers and higher-skilled immigrants in dynamic sectors where training does not meet the demand for personnel.
A positive effect on wages
Just as a surgeon would have difficulty working in a country lacking in anaesthetists, the complementarity between nationals and immigrants causes the arrival of the latter to have a positive influence on the salaries and employment of nationals.
In view of the above, Giovanni Peri calculated that a 1% increase in migration flows would mean a rise in real wages in the long term of between 0.6 and 0.9%.
And, not to mention the fact that the diversity that immigrants bring to the world contributes to the creation of ideas and economic growth (there is a large proportion of naturalized American Nobel laureates and companies like Google, Intel, Paypal, eBay and Yahoo were founded by immigrants).
Immigrants are also net contributors to social systems, as they contribute on average 1% of the total budget in European countries.
The International Labour Organisation calculates, for example, that in Germany an immigrant who reaches the age of 30 will make a net contribution (income minus expenditure) of EUR 150 000 to public budgets on average over his whole lifetime.
At the beginning of his term, Nicolas Sarkozy wanted to go looking for the points of growth that were missing "with his teeth".
Those teeth, which deterred immigrants, had exactly the opposite effect.
Europe has invented democracy, it only needs to think of a European democracy
Democracy is a precious asset, but it is also fragile.
The European continent should be able to remember this because, although it was invented in Athens over two thousand years ago, throughout the 20th century it has suffered the tragedies of the World War, totalitarianism, the Holocaust, the Gulag, but also Franco in Spain, Salazar in Portugal, the colonels in Greece.
Some may have thought that for democracy to win out over its enemies, it would be enough to exercise the vote in the most direct way possible.
We know, since Napoleon "the Little", that it was something thought out.
Universal suffrage, although a necessary condition for democracy, is not sufficient on its own and can even become an 'instrument of oppression', as the Republican philosopher Etienne Vacherot once said.
No, democracy requires much more: a public space, a public spirit, values, an organization, a separation and control of powers, an education, lights, economic and social solidarity, justice.
The crisis we are experiencing in Europe is an economic crisis, but it is about to become a political and democratic crisis.
The palinody of the true-false Greek referendum had, in this respect, a double revealing effect: it showed the need for a powerful return of the political sphere, but also the worrying feeling of its impossibility, of its incongruity.
He must reflect on this ambivalence in order to overcome it.
The truth is that the front lines of the democratic battle have now shifted and that in many cases the Republican soldiers are no longer advancing in the right direction.
We shall not win if we demand a succession of national referendums, organised according to need and in a disorderly way.
A blank signature to the absolute European monarch or a stop to the vacuum of the nationalist hole: what options for the citizen!
No, we do not want to make a coup d'état, but a common exercise, a full exercise, a quiet and continuous exercise, of options and democracy, this time on a European scale.
There is no crisis in Greece, Italy, Spain, Portugal (in fact, we would not know where to end the list), because there is only one crisis, the crisis of Europe.
The whole of Europe is being pushed around by the markets and rating agencies, and is suffering from their impotence and lack of solidarity.
It is Europe as a whole that is being humiliated in the international arena.
We are concerned about the transfer of sovereignty to Europe, but it is the whole of Europe that is slowly losing sovereignty and, with it, each of its nations.
The most urgent thing is that popular sovereignty should regain the helm of the European project.
Because only together can Europeans reduce the burden of debt, free themselves from the markets and prepare their future through investment.
The way out of the crisis will require decisions at European level which cannot be taken without full democratic legitimacy, unless it is to lead us to disaster.
After having fought for a long time against this proposal by the Socialists and Jacques Delors, the whole world is now calling for European economic governance.
I'll see to it.
But to think of it without greater political and democratic integration, and without it being lived as such by the citizens, would be a new folly and would lead us to a new dead end.
We must embark on a new stage in the construction of Europe.
To build the Republic in France, it was necessary to "make" republicans.
Revolution motivated by self-interest would not be enough.
This lesson is still applicable.
We must build a more economically integrated Europe.
It can only be achieved by building a Europe which is more democratic politically, a true European sovereignty of the people.
To build Europe, we must make ourselves European.
Contactless chip cards are becoming widespread
The world's chip card show opens on Tuesday in Villepinte, near Paris, with an optimistic atmosphere.
In fact, 2011 should end with an 11% increase in global sales of cards with microprocessors (bank cards, phones with SIM cards, etc.), with a total of 6,000 million units, according to calculations by the Eurosmart cabinet.
The most powerful segment is contactless technology, which allows you to pay for public transport or purchases simply by bringing the card to a reader.
This year 460 million contactless cards will be sold worldwide, 320 million more than the previous year!
Its share should continue to increase in 2012 (foreseen at 580 million units) and represent about 10% of the global chip card market (6,925 million cards).
Europe, which has long lagged behind the Asia-Pacific region, is gaining ground in the contactless payment sector.
Some 26 million Visa cards already have this feature, which is accepted at 75,000 payment terminals.
In France, the start is more modest: 400,000 contactless Visa cards are in use.
But the big surfaces work for four.
Carrefour has issued 2.5 million contactless Pass MasterCards this year.
However, in order to get up to speed, banks need to make them available to their customers.
"Two large French establishments have committed themselves to systematically distributing contactless banking cards to their customers in the future", said Gérard Nébouy, director general of Visa Europe France.
Banks test mobile payments
But it is only a first step towards the payment medium of the future: the mobile phone.
At present, there are few devices equipped with NFC (Near Field Communication) technology, which is indispensable for transactions.
"They are lagging".
"But it should finally experience a real boom next year".
"We expect between 80 and 120 million units to be sold worldwide in 2012", explains Marc Bertin, president of Eurosmart.
But the banks are taking the lead.
Crédit Agricole announced yesterday that it will launch a trial between December and next June in Caen.
The iPhones of around 200 customers and collaborators will be equipped with a case that allows contactless payment.
The BPCE has a similar project in Strasbourg and Marseille.
And Société Générale also said yesterday that it is preparing to market an offer that allows its customers to pay contactless via their mobile phone.
From the Sahara to Nigeria, the terrorist front is on the rise
Paris is concerned about the links between Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb and the Boko Haram sect.
The long suspected links between the terrorist group Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (Aqmi) and the Nigerian Boko Haram sect have been confirmed.
On Sunday, Algerian Deputy Foreign Minister Abdelkader Messahel even claimed that Algiers already "has the certainty".
"The way both organizations operate and the intelligence reports show that they are cooperating", he explained, without providing further details.
Paris seems to reach a similar conclusion.
The investigation into the kidnapping of two Frenchmen in Niger last January would have reopened the runways.
Kidnapped from a restaurant in Niamey by people connected to Aqmi, Antoine de Lécouro and Vincent Delory died the next day along with several of their captors during an operation launched by French special forces.
In the rubble of the intervention, French and Nigerian investigators discovered several phone chips belonging to the terrorists.
Terrorist axis
The study of the calls made indicates to several interlocutors based in Mali, Niger and Nigeria.
According to Radio France Internationale (RFI), two numbers especially caught the interest of investigators: one leads to a Nigerian who spent a long time in Maiduguri, a city in northern Nigeria, the birthplace of Boko Haram, and the other to a man who is allegedly close to Aqmi and the sect.
"This is progress, but we should certainly wait for more formal evidence before we talk about operational cooperation between Aqmi and Boko Haram".
"But it is possible".
"We have known for years that the sect enjoys outside financial and intellectual support and is becoming more active", says Kunle Amuwo, a Nigerian researcher.
In recent months, such "support" has become increasingly evident in the evolution and discourse of Boko Haram or its modes of operation, which now involve the use of increasingly complex kamikaze or explosive devices similar to those used by Aqmi.
The international community, starting with Washington, has been pressing Abuja to take account of the problems generated by Boko Haram.
The Nigerian authorities have, in fact, long considered the group to be a community of the uninterested.
A Rapid Success
Founded in 2002 in Maiduguri around a mosque, a school and the fundamentalist imam Mohammed Yusuf, Boko Haram (meaning, in Hausa, "Western education is a sin") is inciting the establishment of an Islamic emirate in the Muslim north of Nigeria.
In this poor region, the association is experiencing rapid success.
It is politicized and demands strict respect for sharia, while its militants are thrown into the fight against the ungodly central government.
The latter are oriented primarily to churches, bars, administrations.
In 2009, Boko Haram militants were especially active and attacks on police stations increased.
Abuya's reaction was, as is usually the case, widespread.
The army attacked the city and 800 people were killed.
Mohammed Yusuf, arrested while alive, receives death in prison.
Since then, the sect has become radicalized and abandoned its northern fiefdoms.
Last Christmas, he claimed responsibility for an attack that killed 80 people in Jos and then another in Abuja.
In June, Boko Haram again attacked Abuja, particularly the sheltered police headquarters, in a suicide attack, the first of its kind.
In August, the local United Nations headquarters becomes his first international target.
The creation of a terrorist axis in Africa, which would extend from Mauritania to Somalia and Nigeria, is of concern to all security specialists.
While Aqmi has attacked Mali and Niger and the Somalis of Al-Chebab operate in Kenya, Boko Haram is emerging as a new threat in the heart of the continent.
Last week, during a meeting in Nigeria with President Goodluck Jonathan, Alain Juppé warned him against Boko Haram and said he was willing to "share all the information".
The world according to Republican presidential candidates
In dealing with China, Iran and aid to Israel, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, and Rick Perry rival in simplicity and lack of knowledge.
Can an America weakened by crisis manage a complex world with simple or even simplistic ideas?
Listening to the Republican presidential candidates, voters might think that's what it is.
In recent days, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, Rick Perry and the other candidates have been making more and more loud statements and short cuts on foreign policy, traditionally a strong point of the Republicans.
The often unfounded slogans about China, Iran, aid to Israel are being spread.
Mitt Romney, the top contender for the nomination by the "Grand Old Party", has threatened to take the Chinese to the WTO and sue them "for currency manipulation", a key issue in an America exasperated by the migration of entire segments of its sector to Asia.
It is not a matter of whether that means the explosion of a trade war, he said.
Jon Huntsman, former Obama Ambassador to China and the only candidate with a sophisticated view of foreign policy, almost chokes on an emotionally "polite" attitude.
He has called for a firm but constructive dialogue with Beijing (Obama's current position).
But Huntsman, who is stuck in the depths of the probes, is still inaudible.
In the Reagan style.
Romney has also promised military intervention in Iran if sanctions fail to disrupt its nuclear program.
"If elected, I will stop Iran", he boasted.
"If Obama gets reelected, they'll have the bomb".
He also promised to increase military aid to Israel, accusing Obama of failing to meet his obligations to that partner.
Businessman Herman Cain, the second highest-ranked candidate, shows a shameful ignorance of such issues.
Recently, it urged countering the Chinese military threat because Beijing "is trying to develop nuclear capability", seemingly ignoring the fact that China has had the military atom since 1964.
Texas Governor Rick Perry, who supports Israel and wants to intervene in Iran, says he, for his part, is willing to deploy the U.S. military to Mexico to fight the drug cartels.
The use of torture against alleged terrorists, banned by Obama in 2009, is also advocated by Cain, Perry and candidate Michele Bachmann.
The differences are considerable with the 2008 Republican candidate, John McCain, a heavyweight in foreign policy.
Opponents of the current president say that Reagan also had simple ideas and won the Cold War.
Remember that Obama himself was an amateur and had to loosen the piston in the fight against terrorism.
They rightly insist on the failure of his naïve dialogue with Iran, on the hasty departure of the "boys" from Iraq and on his misrepresentations in Libya, and they label him weak.
But the attacks are not easy for them.
The public is rather positive about Obama's national security record, which ended with Bin Laden.
From Iraq, he is wary of military interventions that generate a collapse.
And by arguing that America needs to be economically rebuilt to resurrect its leadership, Obama gives the impression of being more just.
Nord Stream, the new gateway for Russian gas to Europe
The Nord Stream gas pipeline, which links Western Europe directly to Russia via the bottom of the Baltic Sea, has already been put into operation.
It must supply gas to meet the needs of 30 million households.
Gazprom, the Russian gas giant, wanted to celebrate the event with great pomp.
Last Tuesday, more than 500 guests, including four Heads of State or Government, attended the opening of the Nord Stream, the new gas pipeline linking Russia directly to Germany under the sea, on the shores of the Baltic Sea, accompanied by orchestra music and a delicate buffet.
Symbolically, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Russian President Dmitri Medvedev, French Prime Minister François Fillon and his Dutch counterpart Mark Rutte have together turned the steering wheel of the valve that controls the entry of Russian gas into the Western European grid.
The new pipeline will bring an additional 27.5 million cubic metres of Russian gas to Western Europe each year via a first 1,224 km link linking the St Petersburg region with the state of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania.
A second pipeline should be completed by the end of 2012 and will supply a total of 55 billion cubic metres of gas, enough to cover all French consumption.
In addition, there is already talk of the possibility of building a third pipe along the same route.
For Gazprom, the timely completion of this huge project looks like a victory.
Poland and the Baltic States had strongly opposed the project.
Nord Stream will make it possible to supply gas directly to Germany, avoiding the overland route through third countries (Poland and Ukraine).
Suddenly, these two countries lose some of their power: it will be harder for them to influence Russia by threatening to close its access to Western European markets.
At the height of the debate, Warsaw did not hesitate to compare Nord Stream as a "new German-Soviet pact", referring to the alliance between Hitler and Stalin to occupy Poland in 1939.
I mean, if the subject is politically sensitive.
Western Europe, by supporting the Russian project, has obtained greater security of supply.
But the price is a weakening of Europe's energy, as the project has created a gap between Eastern and Western Europeans.
In just five years Russia has succeeded in making her vision of a direct alliance between Russia and the rich Western countries, large gas consumers and with increasingly limited reserves, come to fruition.
'This pipeline is a component of our partnership with Russia, a new artery that links us organically,' said François Fillon at the inauguration of the pipeline, demonstrating how the major contracts in the gas sector are as much political as economic.
All this explains the broad smiles on the faces of Gazprom's executives, numerous in Lubmin, at the point of arrival of the gas.
The construction of this pipeline is also a technical achievement.
The underwater pipe is made of steel coated with cement to protect against ship anchors.
It rests on the sea floor, at an average depth of 200 m.
To build it, it was necessary to avoid minefields dating back to World War II.
"A hundred of them had to be removed or destroyed as a precaution", says Jens Müller, spokesman for Nord Stream.
It was also necessary to extend the measures for the protection of fauna and flora.
The tube is a long metal snake that weighs 242 Eiffel Towers and is not interrupted along its entire length by valves or maintenance stations.
A control platform in Swedish waters was planned, but the project was abandoned after the Swedes were reluctant to allow a Russian state company to establish itself permanently at sea off their coast.
"In the event of a breakdown, we will cut off the gas in less than a minute", says Jens Müller.
In the event of a leak, the gas from the pipeline will therefore be released into the atmosphere.
But builders consider leakage unlikely, since they have planned for joints that are forecast to leak once every 100,000 years.
The pipeline is monitored by a submarine robot, towed by a vessel, which performs external inspections, and by a device that travels along the inside of the pipeline.
It is shaped like a cigar, and is inserted into the tube, which is about three feet [one meter] in diameter, and is moved by the gas.
On arrival, after three full days of travel at a speed of three metres per second, it provides precise data on possible deformations of the metal.
The pipeline has been designed to run for 50 years without any repair.
The circulation of the gas is guaranteed simply by the pressure.
At the beginning it's 200 bars and at the exit 100 bars.
Five companies have joined forces to carry out this project.
The leading company is Gazprom, which owns 51% of the shares.
It was joined by Germany's E.ON and BASF (15.5% each), the Dutch Gasunie and the French GDF Suez group (9% each).
These five companies have created a joint venture, called Nord Stream, to build and operate the pipeline.
It is based in Zoug, Switzerland, where taxation is particularly favourable.
Gazprom then leased the entire gas transport capacity to Gazprom for a renewable period of 25 years.
'Gazprom will pay for the total capacity, regardless of how much gas is actually transported,' says Jens Müller.
The construction of the gas pipeline was financed by 30% from shareholders and 70% from bank loans.
The total cost of the project should reach 7.4 billion euros for the two pipes.
For GDF Suez, for example, the investment has reached 240 million.
But the minority shareholders are confident that they will not exceed their investment, since Gazprom alone assumes the risk of the expenses.
The pipeline emerges from the Baltic at Lubmin, on a sandy coast planted with pine trees.
A series of valves, 15 feet high, form the gas outlet.
There are sensors that measure the pressure, the temperature and the specific characteristics of the gas on arrival, before it is transferred to the German gas pipelines.
Since last Tuesday, the terminal has been receiving one million cubic meters of Russian gas every hour.
At full capacity, it will be three million per hour and in 2012, six million.
Moleskine, a branded notebook.
Created half a century ago by an Italian company, Moleskine wants to give people back the taste for writing.
It has an air of adventure, of hours of writing by candlelight.
The Moleskine notebook is easily recognized, with its black rectangular pulp, its rubber, its leaves of broken white color, as aged by time.
However, the Moleskine notebooks in their current form were born... in 1997.
The Italian company Modo Modo, based in Milan, decided at that time to launch a notebook of design, but distinguished.
Maria Sebregondi, then a consultant for the company, was responsible for the launch of the new product.
The libretto is inspired by an ancient production technique, mole skin, which refers to a varnished cotton that was used, among other things, to cover the banquets.
This type of notebook was highly prized by writers and travelers.
"Moleskine has adapted to the current taste an old and forgotten object, an icon of the avant-garde artists until the 20th century", says Maria Sebregondi, who has since become responsible for the brand in Modo Modo.
And he succeeded.
Between 2006 and 2010, sales increased by 26%, to a volume of 12,7 million units sold.
The confidential production of the first few years, when only 3,000 notebooks were designed, has been far behind.
Moleskine goes beyond the borders of Italy and exports its products to 70 countries, from France to the United States.
It is difficult to determine the profile of the buyer, since the notebook attracts businessmen as well as students and professionals.
Like Moleskine, its users are cosmopolitan, open-minded and cultured.
The small Italian company, which started with 12 employees, now has about 100 and, since 2008, has two offices: one in Milan and the other in New York.
He distributes his notebooks in bookstores, from the Fnac to small shops in the city centre, and has been able to impose his identity.
"We have adapted to the times and the need to write, despite the boom in e-mails", explains Maria Sebregondi.
This cultural signature goes hand in hand with the development of Moleskine: recently, the brand has launched the exhibition "Detour" where architects or artists exhibit their own notebook.
In August, she also released a notebook with leopard covers, on the occasion of the Locarno Film Festival.
Taking advantage of its success and this cultural aura, Moleskine has been able to diversify its products: bags, diaries, pens, computer cases... The brand covers a wide range of supports.
A success that is enviable: in autumn 2006, Modo Modo was acquired by the investment fund SG Capital Europe, now Syntegra Capital, thus writing a new page in the history of Moleskine.
Why is the unemployment rate for disabled workers still so high?
Around 19% of disabled people are looking for a job.
The 15th Disabled Employment Week begins today.
Despite a determined public policy, implemented since 2005, the unemployment rate among disabled people is double the average rate: 19%, compared to 9% for the population as a whole.
How discouraging?
"No", says Éric Blanchet, director general of Adapt, the association that organises the week for the employment of the disabled.
"The progress made over the last 15 years is considerable.
"At that time, the unemployment rate was not twice but three times higher than the average.
"However, there is still a great deal to be done".
It should be mentioned that the disabled unemployed still face numerous obstacles to access to employment.
They tend to be older: 37% are over 50 (an average of 17%).
They have a low level of qualifications: 80% have not completed upper secondary school and, of the 2.3 million students in higher education, only 10,000 are disabled.
Lastly, long-term unemployment is widespread among them: 53% for the disabled, compared with 38% on average.
In other words, there are many issues that make it particularly difficult to return to the world of work and that "are the core of the problem", says Christian Grapin, general director of Tremplin, an association set up in 1992 to help companies recruit disabled workers.
Those are the objective obstacles.
In addition, there are those who are not mentioned; the mentality of the people advances, but too slowly.
A study carried out in April by the IMS-Entreprendre association for the Cité pointed out that the directors surveyed had "a low level of knowledge about disabilities", with an "excessive representation of people in wheelchairs, physically or intellectually disabled".
The result: private enterprises with more than 20 employees are far from the target of hiring 6% of disabled workers, which was set in a law of 1987.
According to the latest available figures, dating from 2008, they reach a ratio of 2,6%.
"We are now at around 3%", says Pierre Blanc, director general of Agefiph, the body responsible for collecting contributions from companies that do not comply with this law.
The proof: the number of establishments 'subject to this contribution', as well as the amounts disbursed, have decreased between 2007 and 2011, from 59 000 to 46 000 structures (and from 606 to 480 million euros).
"The 2005 law, which increased contributions, has generated a lot of pressure for companies", explains Pierre Blanc.
"But this improvement also reflects a real awareness, particularly among the larger groups".
According to the Ministry of Labour, only 59% of companies with 20 to 49 employees have disabled employees on their staff, compared with 82% of companies with 100 to 199 employees.
Hazard: "A joy"
As they face the Blues on Tuesday night (20:45), Eden Hazard and Georges Leekens have no qualms about the pleasure they take in this friendly.
We dare not say that there was collusion between them, but the image is symbolic.
Sitting side by side on the podium of the Stade de France auditorium, Georges Leekens and Eden Hazard have truly made peace.
Five months after his striker's spiteful gesture against Turkey, the Belgian coach has nothing but praise for him.
"I was very happy for Eden, for her progress and for being Belgian".
"I want to go forward", the Lille striker replies.
As for the contrast between his performances in his team and in the selection, "it's a set", he has justified himself.
"In Lille, I'm here all year round, which doesn't apply to Belgium.
"I have to settle down".
Called to play against Romania on Friday night, taking into account this match against France, Hazard comes to Saint-Denis to, at last, "shine".
Not to mention the pleasure.
He has been cheering for the Bleus since he was seven years old, as well as during the victorious campaigns of 1998 and 2000.
"I've always been a fan", he says.
This will undoubtedly reinforce the 'particular' nature of the meeting.
Especially because he will face "Mathieu (Debuchy), Yohan (Cabaye) and Adil (Rami) ", he recalls.
"We just had a fight.
"Playing against them is always a joy".
The Commission has already taken the initiative in this area.
"Pride" for playing "a gala game".
"I am proud" to see, as a "neighbour", that France "is back to being a very high level team", about a year after the Knysna trauma.
"Laurent Blanc has done a formidable job", he said enthusiastically.
While Belgium will not be attending the next European competition, the coach would be delighted to be able to share a plane with the Bleus to Brazil in 2014.
"Our little Belgians are growing", he said.
"We're building something; the players are ambitious, they're hungry.
"You'll be able to see him in the next games". Including the game against France.
Portugal shows great confidence
Paulo Bento's Portugal are looking forward with great optimism to the second leg against Bosnia, which will be played on Tuesday in Lisbon.
In the first game, both teams lacked realism.
"When these 90 minutes are up, we will be a happy team and, above all, a happy country".
Paulo Bento is already seen in Poland and Ukraine.
He has no doubt; the Selecçao, which he has been managing since September 2010, will qualify for the Euro 2012.
Indeed, only 90 minutes separate Portugal from happiness.
But there's a game to play and a rival, Bosnia, to beat.
Considering the first leg 0-0, Friday in the hell of Zenica, it seems obvious that the thing is not decided.
Portugal dominated the match for over an hour, yes, but couldn't score the valuable goal that quiet would have given them.
"It's a good result, but it also carries a risk, because we haven't scored away from home".
But at home, in the luminous Estadio da Luz in Lisbon, the Portuguese are convinced they will pass, in front of a crowd that should be just as excited, even if it is clear that the match "is very even", said an optimistic but lucid Benedict.
"We hope the game will be very even, but we are completely convinced that we can take the lead", declared the 42-year-old Portuguese coach.
"We still have a 50% chance of participating in Euro 2012", said Carlos Queiroz's successor.
The draw on Friday in Bosnia forces the Portuguese to score and win.
The Bosnians could get a draw, but they need to score too.
"It's a good result, but it also carries a risk, because we haven't scored away from home", Bento laments.
"We are going to play against a team that has great technical quality and players with great individual quality", he added.
As in Zenica, the Portuguese will go with the intention of exerting, from the outset, maximum pressure on the Bosnians to "not give them time to think".
A good idea, as long as it's realistic this time.
