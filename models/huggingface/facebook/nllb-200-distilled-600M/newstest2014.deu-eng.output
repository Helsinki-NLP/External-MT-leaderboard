Guarantee: Even more safety for pedestrians
They are not 100 metres apart: on Tuesday, the new B 33 pedestrian street lamp was put into operation in Gutach in the village parking lot - in view of the older city hall.
Two plants so close together: intention or a Turtle Citizen Strike?
The Mayor of Gutach gave a clear answer to this question yesterday.
"The town hall light was installed at the time because it secured the school road", Eckert explained yesterday.
The Kluser-Ampel is safe for cyclists, bus passengers and Bergle residents alike.
The plant, which was officially commissioned yesterday, is important for the Sulzbachweg/Kirchstraße intersection.
We have the museum, two churches, a spa, the bus station, a doctor and a bank, and the traffic flow from the Grub area.
"With the high traffic and pedestrian traffic, another light had to be turned on to protect them", says Eckert.
This is also confirmed by Peter Arnold of the Offenburg Land Council.
"According to current measurements, about 12 000 vehicles pass through Gutach on the B33 every day, about 10 percent of which are heavy goods traffic", says Arnold.
Therefore, the construction of another lighthouse is more than necessary: "Security is easy here", says Arnold.
In total, four traffic checks were carried out, and a circular traffic was also envisaged, but was abandoned again due to the narrow traffic at the Sulzbachweg/Kirchstraße intersection.
According to Arnold, everything was tested before the light poles were selected: "Using an extra for us truck loaded with particularly long wooden poles, we tested whether these vehicles could go out of the Sulzbach road to the B33 without knocking over the light poles".
The €15,000 lighting system itself is the "most modern thing on the market today", Arnold explained.
The plant is equipped with colored LEDs that shine so brightly that the lights are clearly visible to drivers, for example, even in the deepest sun.
And it's also economical: the older lighting systems use about 100 watts, the new ones just eight watts.
There are three lighting systems per direction.
Arnold explained the technique of the new plant: it is equipped with two radar sensors.
If the pedestrian presses the light button, the upper radar sensor tests the traffic situation.
If the road is clear, the pedestrian will be greener immediately, otherwise it will take about 15 seconds.
Another radar sensor checks if the green phase can be completed for the pedestrian.
"If a group or disabled person were to cross the road, the green phase would be extended, so everyone would be safe to cross the road", Arnold explained.
Of course, the driver must think as a partner and observe the track.
This was not the case yesterday: the light barely showed the pedestrian green, a high-end vehicle came through - in bright red.
For more than 30 years, Joseph Winkler has been writing about the needs of his childhood and youth from the soul.
The catastrophes of his Catholic village childhood - languagelessness, the tendency to crude violence and dull sexuality, narrowness and joylessness - were often described by the Carnatic poet.
The Booker Prize winner is known primarily as a prose writer, and theatre texts are rare in his work.
Collage of prosthetic texts Gerhard Fresacher has put together a collage of prosthetic texts for his performance "Wetterlights on the tongue", which is now on display in the X garage at Petersplatz.
The theatermaker combines elements from the autobiographical novel "Der Leibeigene" (1987) with prosaminiaturas from "Leichnam, belairend seine Familie" (2003).
On the largely empty stage - a basic requirement: a crushed sofa, where couples are clutching and masturbating - the eight-piece ensemble hangs around the text.
Director Fresacher seems to have little faith in the text.
The 70-minute performance surpasses the template with a wealth of directing footage, known from the repertoire of post-dramatic forms of play.
The actresses are particularly concerned with the sometimes questionable stage adaptations.
They're touched hard, their heads submerged, their evening gowns covered in the wall.
Trapped in cellophane or miter, they staged them on dangerously high sticks, either monologizing loudly or lying completely silent on the stage floor.
The text is hardly communicated in this rigorous manner.
The best part of the evening is when you sing - the band's range from Deep Purple to folk songs.
It is only towards the end of the exaggerated performance that the silence comes, and Winkler's absurd humor flashes forth.
A black box in the car?
U.S. road planners are looking for a source of money to repair the decaying highway system, and they believe they have found the solution in a small black box that can fit in the dashboard of every car.
The devices, which record every mile driven and report the information to the authorities, are the focus of a controversial effort by Washington and the federal planning agencies to revise the outdated system of financing U.S. roads.
The usually rather boring area of road planning has suddenly sparked an intense debate with colorful alliances.
Libertarians have allied themselves with environmental groups and advocate that the government use the small boxes to record the kilometres travelled and possibly where they were driven and then use the information to calculate tax returns.
The Tea Party is terrified.
The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) is also deeply concerned and has a number of data protection concerns.
But while Congress cannot agree on a course of action, several states do not wait any longer.
They are currently considering how they can switch over to a system where drivers pay for each mile they drive over the next ten years.
Thousands of drivers have already tested the travel scripts, some of which are equipped with GPS monitoring.
This is a must for our country.
"It's nothing we're just going to use", said Hasan Ikhrata, executive director of the Southern California Assn. of Governments, which plans to record the miles driven by all California drivers in the state by 2025.
The way we pay these taxes will change.
The technology for that is there.
The initiative comes at a time when the Highway Trust Fund, which is funded by taxes Americans pay on the Zappa Column, is bankrupt.
But in America, we don't get as much fuel as we used to.
Cars use less gas.
The state mineral oil tax of 18.4 cents per gallon (less than 4 eurocents per litre) has not increased for 20 years.
Politicians do not dare to raise taxes even for a penny at high alcohol prices.
The gas tax is simply not sustainable, says Lee Munnich, a transportation law expert at the University of Minnesota.
His state recently equipped 500 cars with traveling license plates to test a mile-based payment system.
This is the most sensible alternative in the long term, he said.
Bureaucrats call it a mile-based user fee.
It is not surprising that the idea is welcomed by urban liberals, for example, the tax could be used to influence driving behaviour in a way that reduces congestion and climate-damaging emissions.
California planners rely on the system to develop strategies to achieve the state's ambitious, legally enshrined climate change goals.
But Republican Bill Shuster of Pennsylvania, chairman of the House Transportation Committee, has also stated that he sees it as the most viable long-term alternative.
The Reason Foundation's freelancers are also inspired by the idea of paying drivers for their distance.
This is not a tax that disappears into a black hole explains Adrian Moore, Vice President of Policy at Reason.
People pay directly for what they get.
The movement is also supported by two former U.S. transportation ministers who in a 2011 report called on Congress to move toward mileage-based billing.
The U.S. Senate approved a $90 million pilot project last year that would have included 10,000 cars.
But the House majority opposed the advance, responding to the concerns of rural MPs, who represent people who often have to travel many miles to work or the city on their daily routes.
Several states and major cities are moving in this direction, however, on their own.
Oregon is the most engaged, currently recruiting 5,000 drivers for the largest experiment in the country.
These drivers will soon be paying the mileage fees to the state instead of the mineral oil tax.
Nevada has already completed a pilot project.
New York City is considering one of these.
Illinois is testing it on a limited scale with trucks.
And the I-95 coalition, which includes transportation ministries from 17 states on the east coast (including Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Florida), is currently looking into how to implement the change.
The concept is not a universal hit.
In Nevada, where 50 volunteers were recently equipped with the equipment, motorists were skeptical that the government could track their every move.
Concerns about Big Brother and the like were a big problem, explains Alauddin Khan, head of strategy and outcome management at the Nevada Department of Transportation.
People didn't want it.
When the test was about to begin, the ACLU of Nevada warned on its website: "It would be relatively easy to turn the travel writers into advanced surveillance devices".
There is no need to build a gigantic, bulky technological infrastructure that would inevitably be used to capture data on the daily movements of individuals.
Nevada is one of a number of states that are now looking for affordable technology to help the state track the miles driven, but not exactly when and where.
That, Khan said, would also calm the public.
The pursuit of this technology has led some authorities to a small startup called True Mileage in California.
The company originally did not file to help states tax motorists.
Rather, their aim was to gain a foothold in an emerging market for car insurance, where drivers are expected to pay based on miles driven.
But the devices they've tested are also interesting to road planners because they don't work with GPS and they only provide limited information that is regularly uploaded by modem.
People are more willing to participate if their speed and locations are not recorded, explained Ryan Morrison, Managing Director of True Mileage.
Some of these public pilot programmes have made major mistakes.
There are much cheaper and less intrusive ways to do this.
In Oregon, planners are experimenting with giving drivers a range of options.
You can choose a device with or without GPS.
Or they choose no device at all and instead pay a flat fee based on the average miles driven by all residents of the state.
Other agencies hope to sell the concept of a suspicious public by equipping the devices with more functions than with fewer.
In New York City, traffic officials are planning to develop a taxation device that can also pay parking fees, pay for insurance only for miles driven, and collect speed data from other vehicles in real time to help drivers avoid traffic jams.
Authors would be motivated to participate by the added value of the benefits offered by the system, says a city planning document.
Some road planners, however, wonder if the whole talk of paying for a mile is just a huge distraction.
Officials at the Metropolitan Transportation Commission for the San Francisco Bay Area said Congress could solve the bankrupt Highway Trust Fund problem simply by raising fuel taxes.
An additional one-off fee or annual fee could be imposed on drivers of hybrid vehicles or other vehicles that use little petrol, so that they too pay a fair share.
There is no need for surgery if aspirin is enough, explains Randy Rentschler, Commission's Head of Legislation and Public Affairs.
When we do that, hundreds of millions of drivers worry about their privacy and many other things.
Kingsfield: Small team struggling
The volunteer fire department handled its fall head test with bravery despite a lack of personnel.
Only eleven men took part in the exercise.
In his training session, the division commander Hans Kammerer had chosen the property "Peder" in Burgbergstraße.
I'm told there was a short circuit during the sawing.
Two people were injured in the fire and smoke, but one of them was still able to send an emergency call.
Two Wehrmacht airships were preparing to enter the building after Hans Kammerer first checked the situation.
After a short time, the first person was found and led out.
The second person had to be carried.
This was not so easy, since a narrow staircase was also to be overcome.
The building, a workshop with an integrated stables for two horses, was not easy to secure.
There was a lot of wood and straw balls in it.
Then there were electrical machinery for working wood.
The first fire attack was carried out through the tank in the vehicle.
Another line was drawn through an overflow hydrant about 100 metres away.
Now three extinguishing devices could be designed.
A cavity tube was also used in the building.
Hans Kammerer also tried to show what can be done with little staff.
In case of emergency, support is provided through the Königsfeld Day Task Force.
The commander was satisfied with the progress of the exercise.
Networking of universities and businesses is important
During his visit to the Breisgau-Hochschwarzwald district, the President of the Landtag, Guido Wolf, also in Titisee-Neustadt, was asked where tomorrow's labour force comes from.
In the Hochschwarzwald Centre, he worked with the managing directors of vocational schools and the district school and the chairman of the Parent Councils on this important issue.
"Education is an important location factor", stressed Claudia Stehle, Director of the Hans-Thoma School, who presented the networked school project Education Centre Hochschwarzwald.
Wolf was impressed by the training model projects.
Since 2011, there has been a successful cooperation between the Forest City Funding Centre, the District High School and the Vocational School Centre.
He also praised the family-friendliness in the county.
"It is important to keep in mind not only the family phase but also the care phase of caring for family members as demographic changes occur", Wolf explained.
He also pointed out that more and more workers were taking care of their loved ones.
"Without the support of employers, the resulting burden on employees can lead to termination of employment", Wolf said.
But no one could afford to lose skilled workers, he continued.
Another particularly important factor is the networking of universities and businesses.
"Because those who have already learned the advantages of the region during their studies often retain their knowledge and skills in the regional economy, which contributes to the strengthening of the region", the Landtag President expressed his conviction.
The Commission has also proposed a number of measures to improve the quality of training and to improve the quality of training.
In his view, the advantage of the district is its location in the southwest of Germany, in close proximity to France and Switzerland.
He also experienced the efforts already made to expand public transport on his train journey from Titisee-Neustadt to Freiburg.
"Keep your head up and make sure that public transport is better", he told local politicians.
A fun afternoon with music
For 15 years now, the Kaul family has been inviting the Dietinger seniors to coffee, cake and then dinner.
In the past, the elderly were hosted in the resting place.
Meanwhile, this afternoon is being held at St. Joseph's.
The locals were looking forward to the delicious cakes and cakes.
Later, there was sausage salad.
Silvia Kimmich-Bantle and her father Karl Kimmich used common melodies to talk.
The over 100 year old natural stone wall, which forms the frontal boundary of the old schoolyard and the church street, is to be included in the city of Bräunlingen's cost of renovation plan.
In the days before Kilbig, the first works of restoration of the front schoolyard included a small corner wall to stabilize and statically relieve the over a hundred-year-old natural stone wall with balustrade.
The next step is to involve the National Landmark Office in the planning and to develop a concept for the restoration of the old wall, according to Alexander Misok of the Bräunlinger City Building Office.
The Commission will then carry out a cost calculation by experts, which will be submitted to the City Council for decision and determination of the next steps.
A decision on this is expected to be taken as early as next year.
After the renovation, paving and tree planting of the old schoolyard within the two side wings of the school built in 1912, the necessary boundary walls must be repaired from scratch and rebuilt in the near future.
The historic, hundred-year-old boundary wall of the old schoolyard to Church Street is mainly damaged by water and frost, as there is no drainage, needs to be renovated and has an arched curve forward.
Deep cracks in individual stones indicate weather damage, but the wall is not currently in danger of collapse.
A solid wall is a prerequisite for a schoolyard used by pupils, which has been achieved by the current fixing work.
The schoolyard renovation was originally planned for 2008/2009, but high unplanned expenditure delayed it.
A key word in the historic school wall renovation, which has even been used for filming, will be spoken by the national government.
If instructions come from this side, the town of Bräunlingen hopes for grants from the Monument Keepers.
The students of the Bräunlinger Primary School, who are now being taught again in a well-maintained old school building with a new classroom, will soon be able to use the old schoolyard.
Özdemir wants to get jazz training in Stuttgart
The German Federal President Cem Özdemir has now joined the ongoing discussions on the future of music schools in Baden-Württemberg.
"I think it is wrong to abandon the holistic education at the Stuttgart Music Academy", Özdemir told the Stuttgart News.
Jazz and classical music are now part of the Stuttgart jazz scene.
The Green-Red government, which is considered in Stuttgart as the favourite for a direct mandate in the Bundestag elections on 22 September, opposes this.
This is a new approach to the five music colleges in Baden-Württemberg.
The programme will be transferred from the Stuttgart University of Music to the Mannheim University of Music.
US border: Super tunnel detected for drug trafficking
At the U.S.-Mexico border, investigators have discovered a "super tunnel" for drug trafficking and shut it down.
According to U.S. Customs officials, the more than 500-meter pipeline between Tijuana and San Diego was equipped with electricity, railroad tracks and a ventilation system.
Three suspects were arrested, eight tons of marijuana and nearly 150 kilograms of cocaine confiscated.
The tunnel was not yet in use.
"These cartels are stupid when they think they can dig themselves under the radar", said U.S. Attorney General for the Southern District of California, Laura Duffy, at a press conference outside a warehouse in San Diego where the tunnel's end was discovered.
Turning to the drug gangs, Duffy assured them: "If you continue to build and use these tunnels, we are determined to make a huge waste of your dirty money".
Both the U.S. and Mexican security forces are engaged in a long-running battle against the drug cartels.
Since 2006, more than 77,000 people have been killed in Mexico in connection with drug crime.
Designed by experts
The tunnel's elaborate construction has led investigators to believe that it was designed by architects and engineers and took about a year to build.
The railway was equipped to accommodate electric cars.
On the Mexican side, the entrance is in a building 80 meters from the border.
Authorities say a ladder 20 metres deep leads to the actual tunnel entrance.
The tunnel has a cross section of 1.20 meters high and 90 centimeters wide.
It would have also been suitable to encourage illegal immigration to the United States.
Two of the suspects were arrested in connection with the cocaine fund.
The third, a Mexican, was arrested for the seized marijuana.
All three are facing a maximum sentence of life in prison, officials said.
Since 2006, eight such tunnels have been discovered, the San Diego press conference said.
But it's the first time cocaine has been found in a tunnel like this.
Normally, cocaine is smuggled in smaller quantities and not through tunnels.
This shows the "despair" of drug gangs whose traditional routes have now been cut off, said Bill Sherman of the San Diego Drug Enforcement Agency.
They'd do anything to get into the States.
No details were given to the detainees, at least one being Mexican, it said.
You'll face up to 10 years in prison.
2014 is the year of Geisinger
The anniversary of the city of Geisingen on the occasion of 1250.
The return of the first documentary mention is getting closer and closer.
When the year ends in eight weeks, the anniversary year is coming up.
Geisingen and church buildings were first mentioned together in documents in 794.
In churches, a document was made that mentions both places.
On March 15, there is to be an official opening for the anniversary year, and as Geisingen currently has no hall, this opening event will take place in the place where both were first mentioned 1250 years ago, in churches-hausen.
Several events are planned for the anniversary in Geisingen and in churches.
Church-Hausen will be celebrating its 1250.
Celebrating the return.
Friday with a feast, Saturday and Sunday with a feast around the church hall.
This weekend is also the Church-Hausen Church Festival.
The city's music director, Rudolf Barth, has written a commissioned composition for the city to perform on three dates.
On 21 June, along with the Black Forest Association's Sunday evening celebration, on 12 July in the Arena with fireworks and on 13 December as the first concert of city music in the new festival hall.
It will be completed and inaugurated in the jubilee year, with the official date being the last weekend of September, 27 and 28 September.
On the occasion of the Geisinger city jubilee, a new chronicle is also published.
"It is not only a chronicle of Geisingen itself, but a printed work on the Geisingen of today, which consists of Geisingen, Church-Hausen, Leipferdingen, Aulfingen and Gutmadingen", says Mayor Walter Hengstler.
And even today's geisings celebrate their 2014 birthday, 1974 was the year the space was created with the inclusions.
The new chronicle will then be presented on 21 or 22 November in the new Geisingen Festival Hall.
But 2014 is another year of many anniversaries.
The Strohglonki Fool's Party will begin on February 8 with a feasting evening to mark its 60th anniversary, the Harmony Gutmadingen will be 90 years old and will have its banquet on March 29 and then celebrate the district music festival from May 1 to 4.
The Leipzig Altenwerk is 40 years old, the Geisinger School has been 50 years in the new location and celebrates it on 10 May, the Leipzig Polyhymnia Music Association is 150 years old and celebrates it as part of the Fountain Festival from 4 to 7 July.
The town of Geisingen was first mentioned in a gift certificate, which is owned by the monastery of St. Gallen, in 764.
The document was made in churches (houses) which were the courthouse at the time.
Both communities are therefore mentioned in the same document.
In addition, the municipal reform is 40 years behind schedule.
Council takes aim at railway installations
Is the Deer Crossing to be extensively rebuilt to increase road safety?
Yes, the city council has decided.
Schiltach has to take 220,000 euros for this.
The Deutsche Bahn wants to improve the Kinzigtal railway line next year.
The aim is to increase safety at railway crossings - there are regular collisions of trains with other vehicles nationwide.
If the municipalities agree to the restructuring measures, they must share a third of the costs, the rest being shared between rail and public transport.
Schiltach's city planner Roland Grießhaber explained to the municipality council the specifics of the "Am Hirschen" railway crossing.
The city plans to build a tunnel upstream from the railway line.
Larger vehicles, such as those carrying longwood, could also be stopped in traffic without having to block the tracks.
Grießhaber therefore proposed constructing the necessary support wall so that the city could extend the subsequent road in due course to ensure a smooth flow of traffic.
This was controversially discussed in the town hall, as some councils questioned the need for road expansion: Thomas Kipp brought the mood of critics to the point of saying: "Do we have to take so much money for so few vehicles?"
Mayor Thomas Haas objected: The Deer railway crossing is regularly used for long-haul transport.
Even wood from the Kuhbach area is transported partly over this route because vehicles up to 20 metres long could not use the route on the Haberlesbrücke because they could not turn to the main road there.
In addition, the route serves as a diversion route for those vehicles who are not allowed to use the tunnel when the main road is blocked, Haas argued.
The Commission has therefore decided to extend the period of time for the construction of the 'Herschen' railway, which will be used for the transport of passengers.
The councils agreed to have the road expanded to the expected cost of the road examined.
Nevertheless, the majority agreed to the conversion of the railway junction, provided that the necessary support wall is built so that the city can extend the subsequent road to 'Bahnhofstraße' to approximately 5,5 metres for interchange traffic.
The conversion of the railway junction at the Trautwein-Germany plant could, however, lead to a very different problem, one involving access to the rapidly increasing 'Geralothausweg'.
The administration had asked the Breinlinger Engineering Office to examine the plans for the conversion of the railway, as it was in doubt that the planned connection of the Gerolthausweg would be possible.
The investigation concluded that it could not be excluded that the road conditions could lead to longer vehicles being parked.
The city, as a road construction company, is responsible for this.
The restructuring could therefore lead to liability disputes.
As both the timber drive and the bending worked in the current state of development, the conversion of the railway junction should not be agreed, Haas argued.
The risk of a collision of the train with a vehicle at the crossing is also significantly lower at this point than at the other railway crossings, as the centre of the stop is located directly next to the centre and is well connected.
Even trains coming from the main station would have to be slowed down at this point to avoid collision.
The majority of the people were denied permission to rebuild the railway as the city of Schiltach had to "clean up" the problem of occupying vehicles, the councils said, as the railway could be taken out of responsibility once the construction work was completed.
The Committee considers that the conversion of the railway passages "Vor Heubach" and "Vor Kuhbach" for which crossings agreements have already been concluded with the railway are not problematic.
ESA decides on big space missions: missions for billions
Far-off planets, gravitational waves or black holes - experts at the European Space Agency must now agree on two major projects they want to launch in the next few years.
Thirty proposals were available for selection, five are still in the race.
Far away worlds.
Astronomers have already found more than 1,000 planets in other stars.
Whether there's life on at least some of them, nobody knows.
The choice is hard: should we look for gravitational waves?
Or would you rather explore the origin of the cosmos?
Or searching for planets similar to Earth, perhaps discovering alien life?
These are the questions that the European Space Agency (ESA) is asking itself.
For their Cosmic Vision programme, they are looking for ideas for two major space projects that will make a significant contribution to research.
The budget for such 'L-Missions' is approximately one billion euros each.
The launch is expected to be in 2028 and 2034.
At the beginning of September, the European space elite met in Paris to discuss proposals for such missions.
Thirty ideas were debated, five of which have now been voted on.
Numerous committees have examined the proposals, and have been consulted by the researchers.
The final decision is due to be taken by the Scientific Programme Committee in the coming days.
In total, ESA has selected four major questions to be answered by the missions of the 2007 Cosmic Vision programme.
What are the conditions for the creation of planets and life?
The exact processes of the formation of stars from large gas clouds - and thus the formation of planets orbiting these stars - are still in the literal darkness.
A large infrared telescope in space could penetrate this darkness.
And if a star has a planet, under what circumstances can life be created there?
To address this question, the Space Telescope Cheops is scheduled to launch in 2017 to study 500 known planetary systems in our immediate vicinity.
But the possibilities are limited, Cheops is a small mission with a budget of 150 million euros.
With larger instruments, astronomers could map Earth-like planets and even analyze the composition of their atmospheres, searching for "biomarkers" - gases that are considered to be indicators of biological activity.
How does the solar system work?
This question is also intended to provide insight into the preconditions for the origin of life.
The magnetic activity of a star and the interaction of its magnetic field and the radiation of the particles emitted by it with the planetary system play an important role.
In our solar system, these processes can be studied by example.
With the 'Solar Orbiter', ESA has already approved an M-class mission (with a budget of about half a billion euros) for this question.
The probe is scheduled to launch in 2017 and closely monitor the surface and activity of the sun.
Jupiter and its moons are of great interest to researchers.
They want to find out what role the giant planet played in the evolution of the solar system.
For this purpose, ESA is planning the first of three L missions in the Cosmic Vision programme.
The Juice spacecraft (Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer) is expected to begin its journey in 2022.
Eight years later, it reaches Jupiter and is to explore the planet's atmosphere as well as the icy moons Europa, Callisto and Ganymed.
What are the basic physical laws of the universe?
The universe offers many opportunities to study matter under extreme conditions and to test whether the laws of nature we know are still valid there.
There may also be deviations that could lead physicists to a new theory under which all known laws of nature can be united.
How did the universe come into being and what does it consist of?
13.7 billion years ago, our cosmos was created by the Big Bang.
In addition to the matter we know, which is made up of stars, planets, and living things like us, there is dark matter whose gravity holds galaxies and galaxy clusters together, and dark energy whose effects accelerate the expansion of the universe.
So far, the researchers don't know what physical laws were in effect in the first few seconds of the Big Bang, or what dark matter and dark energy are.
With Euclid, ESA has already approved an M mission for 2020.
Using a special telescope, the probe will investigate the distribution of matter throughout the universe for the first time, thus allowing conclusions to be drawn on the nature of dark matter and dark energy.
Who could run the race
Of the 30 proposals, only two will remain at the end of the selection procedure.
The best chance of being authorized as an L-mission is that many experts believe that "E-Lisa" is a sophisticated concept for detecting gravitational waves.
Physicists understand changes in the structure of space-time, which Albert Einstein predicted almost 100 years ago.
They haven't been proven to date.
Elisa could do it, the scientists behind the project hope.
The mission has a detector consisting of two or three probes that will be stationed in space.
Unlike plants on Earth, it could also detect gravitational waves created by the Big Bang, providing new insights into the origin of the cosmos.
Four other proposals are competing for the second L-mission: a large X-ray telescope called Athena, which will explore black holes, among other things, "Icy Planets", another mission to the outer planets of the solar system, "Prism", a mission to measure cosmic background radiation, and the "Exoplanet Finder", which will detect and study planets similar to Earth.
Proposals for the transport of samples back from Mars, for the exploration of the moon, Venus and asteroids, and for solar physics have already been submitted.
Snowden is ready to cooperate with Germany on US surveillance
Edward Snowden, the whistleblower for the US intelligence service, has stated that he is ready to travel to Berlin and testify before the German Bundestag if the US National Security Agency and its director Keith Alexander do not give any answers about their activities.
German MP Hans-Christian Ströbele met Snowden on Thursday in Russia, where he was granted asylum, to discuss the statement with him in Germany.
In a letter from Snowden, presented to the media in Berlin on Friday by Ströbele, he writes: Although the result of my efforts has been proven positive, my government continues to treat a deviant opinion as a breach of trust and tries to criminalize political expression with threat of punishment where no defence is possible.
But telling the truth is not a crime.
In the letter, Snowden writes that he believes that the support of the international community can persuade the US government to drop the charges against him.
The charges brought by the U.S. Department of Justice include espionage and theft of state property.
German Interior Minister Hans-Peter Friedrich told Time online: "If Mr Snowden is willing to talk to German representatives, we will find ways to make that possible".
Relations between the United States and Germany are under strain from the claims that the NSA tapped Chancellor Angela Merkel's phone.
Mr Thomas Oppermann, the Member who heads the parliamentary committee responsible for intelligence, said that the opportunity should be taken to hear Mr Snowden as a witness if possible, without endangering him and completely ruining relations with the United States.
Ströbele, a Green MP, posted a picture of himself and Snowden in his Twitter feed.
He was accompanied by two German journalists during his visit to Russia.
Ströbele explained that according to the lawyer of the former NSA employee, Snowden could not return to Russia if he left the country.
If Snowden testifies in Germany, he needs assurances that he's safe there, the MP said.
Snowden explains in his letter that he saw himself being subjected to a "serious and ongoing" persecution campaign that drove him out of his home country.
However, he was touched by the global response to my act of political expression.
Citizens around the world and senior politicians  including in the United States  have described the revelations about an uncontrolled system of comprehensive surveillance as a merit to the general public.
In his letter, Snowden offers the German authorities an offer of cooperation when the humanitarian situation is resolved.
Frontier Airlines is charging for hand luggage
Frontier Airlines plans to charge up to $100 for hand luggage on board.
Frontier Airlines intends to charge up to $100 for a piece of hand luggage and $2 for coffee or lemonade, even though Wednesday's announcement said passengers should keep the entire can.
The new fee applies to hand luggage in the trunk above the seat, small bags under the seat remain free.
Frontier explained that the fee is charged at $25 if the fee is paid in advance, and $100 for travelers who pay first at the boarding station.
Frontier spokeswoman Kate O'Malley said the $100 fee is intended to encourage travelers to take care of the payment in advance.
We do not wish to calculate this sum, she explained.
In 2008, airlines began charging fees for the first and second baggage items left behind.
Passengers attempting to avoid them have therefore stuck as much as possible in their hand luggage, which has often caused overcrowding in the luggage compartments above the seat.
Charges are a way to encourage passengers to take less on board.
O'Malley said the new fee isn't really about making money.
It is the most loyal customers of Frontier who have made it clear that it is becoming increasingly difficult to find a seat in the compartment above the seat.
Passengers who purchase your tickets on the airline's website do not have to pay.
This means that a passenger may carry one piece of luggage free of charge at Frontier's flight deck, but the next person will have to pay $100 for a comparable piece of luggage.
O'Malley explained that Frontier's website and check-in procedures would be changed so that passengers would be informed of the fee before they arrived at the flight deck.
The new hand baggage charge from Frontier will not come into force until summer, and there is no exact date yet.
Passengers often gossip about baggage charges and other charges, but airlines often resort to them.
They argue that transporting luggage costs money and passengers should pay for this service if they want it.
Many on Wall Street see the new baggage charges as a sign that airlines are taking in enough money to cover the cost of air travel after years of losses.
However, most of them have so far been charged for hand luggage.
Spirit Airlines Inc. first charged for hand luggage three years ago and was followed by Allegiant Air, also a low-cost airline.
The only other airline with such a fee is Hungarian Wizz Air, explained airline consultant Jay Sorensen, who closely monitors the additional charges.
He estimated in a December 2011 report that Spirit's hand luggage charge is worth $50 million a year.
Sorensen, who previously held a management position at Midwest Airlines, recently flew with Spirit and was curious about what would happen to him at the runway if passengers were to face the company's unusual hand luggage charge.
The boarding process was one of the most smooth I have seen in my aviation career he said.
I expected to see teeth grinding and hand-shake discussions on the flight deck.
The plane was full, he explained, and boarding was running like butter.
Frontier also follows Spirit on the $2 bill for coffee, tea, lemonade, or juice.
The company said passengers who bought lemonade or juice would be allowed to keep the entire can and be refilled with free coffee.
Water is still free.
US Airways had briefly tried to charge for refreshments in 2008, but withdrew seven months later after passengers complained and no other major company had followed suit.
Frontiers' move to charge for hand luggage when passengers do not buy directly from the airline is the latest initiative to direct customers to its own website.
Airlines pay online travel agencies like Orbitz $10 to $25 per ticket sold.
This gives all companies an incentive to move passengers to buy directly from them instead of through an online travel agency.
Frontier has gone the most far in this area.
In September, the company began to spend half as many multi-purpose miles on bookings via an online travel agency.
On Wednesday, the miles were cut back to 25 percent of the flight path.
A third-party booked borderline flight of over 1000 miles therefore only takes customers 250 miles.
Passengers can also reserve seats exclusively when purchasing directly from Frontier's website.
Frontier has a loyal customer base at its Denver headquarters, but the business shrinks and the company loses money.
Revenue fell 9 percent and flight capacity shrank by nearly 13 percent in the first quarter, according to the financial report released Wednesday by parent company Republic Airways Holdings Inc.
Republic tried to control Frontier's finances as part of the sale.
Proverbs Come from the Bible
About 40 women attended the last women's breakfast this year at the bishop's church in Bisingen.
The theme of the day at the Congregation House was "Proverbs from the Bible" and "Middle Ages Discourse".
After breakfast, Cita Köhler, the president of the church council, gave a talk on the Bible proverbs.
"Language contains life-giving wisdom, rules, or warnings", she explained.
She compared several proverbs with the corresponding Bible verses and explained their meaning.
She used proverbs like: "Wooden tooth is awake, like shards falling from the eyes, an eye is cast on someone, his is given by the Lord in sleep, his hands washed in innocence".
The speaker also asked her listeners to guess which proverb it was.
The medieval rhetoric was adopted by the church minority Christian Dehner: All good things are three, make blue, make something messy.
She explained the meaning and origin of the expressions she called "bridges to the past".
Finally, a tombola was delivered.
The prizes were placed on a table and were humorously described before being passed on to the winners.
Among the guests at the breakfast round was mayor candidate Roman Waizenegger.
Learning instead of unemployment: Pilot project for unskilled tourists
The Mecklenburg Lakeside is the starting point for a pilot project for the tourism industry.
Under the direction of the Federal Labour Agency, 49 women and men who are already working as unskilled in the industry will be qualified as hotel and restaurant professionals over three winters.
"The new thing is that the six-month courses end with diplomas", said Carmen Wiechert of the Neubrandenburg employment agency.
The benefits are diverse: participants would not be unemployed, companies would have trained professionals who were increasingly lacking in hotels and restaurants, and the Agency would not have to finance unemployment.
The project also involves the Chambers of Commerce and Industry in Neubrandenburg and the German Hotel and Restaurant Association (Dehoga) Mecklenburg-Vorpommern.
NSA says an internal error, not hackers, is to blame for the crash.
The shadowy National Security Agency said late Friday that an error had crippled its public website for several hours and not hackers, as claimed online.
NSA.gov was unavailable for several hours tonight because an internal error occurred during a planned update, the spy agency explained in an email message.
The problem will be fixed tonight.
The claim that the failure was caused by a distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack is not true.
In the early evening hours, online server trackers noticed that the NSA website was inaccessible for at least six hours, and for some users, it still is.
Earlier, an NSA spokesman told ABC News that the agency's sensitive internal network was not compromised in any way.
The spokesman said that confidential information was not in danger.
At least one group of hackers claimed to have crippled the NSA website with a DDoS attack.
In such attacks, the target site is flooded with page views until the servers are overloaded and the site crashes.
Cyber tactics are relatively simple and the attacks are not intended to penetrate the internal network of the target system.
The formerly top secret NSA, once nicknamed No Search Agency, is now in the public eye and facing fierce criticism over its extensive surveillance program at home and abroad following revelations in recent months  a result of the secret NSA data stolen and released by disillusioned former NSA employee Edward Snowden.
The growing controversy surrounding the intelligence service fueled initial speculation that the incident today was the result of a targeted cyber operation.
The number of unemployed people fell slightly in October by 22 to 1,307.
Although the quota was 3.1 percent better than last year and even better than in September, "we would have expected more", says Monika Felder-Bauer, deputy head of the Sonthofen Agency for Labour.
This is because many farms have responded to hiring behaviour.
One reason for this is that, according to Felder-Bauer, "we have few professionals in the arts, health care and elderly care".
The Commission has also been working on the proposal for a directive on the protection of workers' rights in the event of a dispute between the Member States.
The winter season begins there in mid-December.
The full background report is available on the Allgäu Advertising Sheet dated 31.10.2013 (page 33).
Bombardier's profit loss after decline in supply and order
Canadian aircraft and railway manufacturer Bombardier Inc reported a 15% drop in net profit on Thursday after being pressured by declining orders and deliveries of aircraft in the third quarter and contractual problems in the rail sector.
Bombardier, based in Montreal, also did not publish flight test data for its brand new CSeries aircraft and did not provide any new information on whether the aircraft could enter commercial service in accordance with the ambitious schedule in September.
The maiden flight of the test aircraft a month and a half ago has so far only been followed by three more launches, which makes it questionable whether the test phase is progressing as planned.
The results were below forecasts, leading to a price drop of over eight percent on the Toronto Stock Exchange.
Cameron Doerksen, an analyst at National Bank Financial, lowered his rating from outperform to sector performance on Thursday, citing the stock's limited price potential over the next one to two quarters.
While weaker aircraft deliveries were largely expected, we are clearly disappointed by the marginal development in transport, Doerksen said in a customer letter.
We believe Bombardier will receive new orders for the CSeries as the test program for the aircraft progresses.
However, if no new orders are announced in the coming months, we expect the market to become more skeptical of the programme.
Bombardier hopes that the CSeries aircraft series can catapult the company into the lower market segment currently dominated by Boeing and Airbus.
The first test aircraft was presented to the public in March and flew for the first time in September after months of delays.
However, so far, mandatory orders for the CSeries with 177 are moderate as potential buyers are waiting for the results of the flight tests and want to see if the company's claims regarding fuel efficiency and cost savings potential of the new jetliner are true.
There are currently a total of 403 orders and commitments from 15 customers and companies.
The Commission has also expressed confidence that the Commission will be able to implement the measures in the light of the above.
The management also assured analysts and the media on Thursday that the programme is on schedule.
The test aircraft did not stay on the ground longer than expected, Beaudoin said at a conference call, adding that ground tests and software updates were being carried out during the aircraft's standby.
Every manufacturer plans differently.
We decided to take a first flight and then suspend a review period, which we did.
This happens throughout the entire flight program.
The second of five test aircraft is expected to be launched in the coming weeks, the remaining shortly thereafter, the company said.
However, analysts remain skeptical that 12 months after the maiden flight, the first customer can start a CSeries aircraft.
Bombardier stated that it would review the EIS and update it in the coming months.
The slow progress of the flight test  even though it is clearly in line with Bombardier's internal planning  reinforces our view that the start-up will be postponed to the first quarter of 2015, Doerksen said.
In the third quarter ending September 30, Bombardier's net profit fell to $147 million, or 8 cents per share, from $172 million, or 9 cents per share, a year earlier.
The adjusted earnings per share is 9 cents unchanged.
Sales declined slightly, falling from $4.2 billion to $4.1 billion.
Analysts had expected a profit of 10 cents per share and a turnover of $4.56 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
The world's fourth-largest aircraft manufacturer says it delivered 45 aircraft in this quarter, down from 57 last year.
Net orders fell from 83 aircraft to 26.
The volume of contracts in the aerospace sector was $32.9 billion on 30 September and remained unchanged as at 31 December.
In the aviation and space sector, the results were within our specifications, but the low order intake and overall market conditions were disappointing, said Beaudoin.
Sales in the aerospace sector fell 13 percent to $2 billion.
Bombardier, the world's largest railroad manufacturer, announced that sales in this sector have increased by almost 11 percent to $2.1 billion.
The volume of orders in the transport sector was $32.6 billion on 30 September, slightly increasing from 31 December.
The profit margin in the transport sector has been affected by settlement problems in some large contracts.
According to the company's management, new rules will be introduced for the fourth quarter.
In the afternoon trading on Thursday, Bombardier's stock fell 8.5 percent to 4.83 Canadian dollars after Google's chief financial officer Patrick Pichette was announced to join the board.
Embraer SA, the world's third-largest commercial aircraft manufacturer and Bombardier's closest rival, reported a 10 percent quarterly profit drop on Thursday.
United States: Shots fired at Los Angeles airport
An unknown person fired shots at LAX airport on Friday morning.
While the airport's management tweeted that the gunman was in custody, the Los Angeles Times reported that the man was dead.
A security guard was also killed.
Media also reported several injuries.
US President Barack Obama is being kept informed of the situation, said White House spokesman Jay Carney.
The incident occurred in Terminal 3, eyewitnesses said they saw a gunman in one of the airports, several media reported.
A traveler told CNN that many people had been looking for shelter in panic.
Travelers would have screamed and children would have cried.
The waiters were panicking, many hiding behind chairs in fear.
He heard two shots, says a traveler for the Los Angeles Times.
A TSA security officer suffered a gunshot wound to the foot.
The scene was "like in a movie".
Afterwards, he was taken to a security area himself, the man reported.
The shooting is said to have taken place near a security checkpoint.
Airport buildings evacuated
Television footage showed numerous ambulance and police cars driving in front of a terminal.
Hundreds of people were evacuated from the building.
Users posted photos on Twitter of a special operations command and a rifle lying on the ground.
As the airport management announced via Twitter, the incident began at 9:30 am (local time).
The roads were blocked, which, according to CNN, caused a long backlog.
It said that, except for landings, air traffic had been temporarily suspended.
However, CNN also saw several airmen take off.
Terminal 3 is primarily operated by smaller US airlines.
LAX Airport in Los Angeles is one of the largest airports in the United States.
Cocaine addict lawyer who warned drug lord about police investigation sent to prison
Basharat Ditta, 42, gave information to the underworld's size Neil Scarborough
The lawyer was afraid his secret drug addiction might come to light.
He was sentenced to three years in prison by the Liverpool Crown Court
A well-known criminal defense lawyer who warned a drug lord about a major police investigation because he feared his secret drug habit might be exposed was sentenced to three years in prison.
Basharat Ditta, 42, provided underworld celebrity Neil Scarborough with sensitive information about investigations into his drug trafficking activities after he was compromised by his own cocaine addiction.
The criminal lawyer, who has been hailed by criminals as a first-class lawyer, nicknamed Bash, was arrested at his home in 2011 after police oversaw Scarborough, which he represented in a previous drug case.
Officials observed Scarborough, 32, delivering three bags of cocaine to the lawyer's house in Blackburn, Lancashire, while he was at a dinner with colleagues at the bar.
The investigation revealed that Ditta regularly used Class A drugs after tests found traces of cocaine in his hair, wallet and credit cards.
Over an eight-month period between January and August 2011, he attempted to obtain unauthorized information about the arrest of two men on behalf of Scarborough and one of his partners.
All four suspects were being monitored by the police during a major investigation into heroin and cocaine trafficking in Lancashire, Cumbria, Merseyside, Berkshire and West Yorkshire.
They were later arrested along with 32 others after police seized a series of searches of homes and seized £1.5 million worth of heroin and cocaine and £200,000 in cash.
Ditta, 42, gave information to the criminals because he feared his drug addiction might become public.
Today, Ditta, who works for the Blackburn-based firm Forbes Solicitors, was found guilty and convicted at Liverpool Crown Court after a three-week trial on two counts of obstruction of justice.
He admitted to possession of cocaine in an earlier interview.
The lawyer was transferred after police found out in their investigation against Scarborough that he had been in regular telephone contact with Ditta in February 2011.
Two investigators followed the suspect and saw him go to Ditta's house and put the drugs with a purity of 60 percent in a black golf glove under the lawyer's trash can.
Shortly after delivering the drugs, Scarborough regularly phoned Ditta, who was at dinner at Blackburn Rovers football stadium in Ewood Park.
The lawyer came home, got the drugs, and then nine messages were exchanged between the two.
It was revealed in court that Ditta was a regular cocaine user after tests revealed Class A drugs in his hair, wallet and credit cards.
Ditta was later arrested but denied taking cocaine, saying he spoke to the alleged dealer because he was his client, and claimed their discussion was "lawyer's secret".
During his arrest, Ditta took his wallet and tried to remove a series of credit cards, but they were secured and a hair sample was taken from him.
During the police interrogation, he stated that he operated an office at both his private address and at his workplace, and clients would call him at home for legal matters.
It was revealed in court that he had called key drug trafficking actors, some of whom he had previously represented, for significant arrests and informed them of what investigators knew about them.
Prosecutor Anne Whyte said, "A criminal lawyer should know better than anyone else that you're not breaking the law".
Ditta is accused of abusing his position as a criminal defense lawyer because he has been too involved with certain clients.
The relationship in question is not simply that of a drug dealer, but that of a drug dealer who supplies his lawyer with drugs.
Some of his statements were undoubtedly legitimate, because he was the lawyer for these people.
But this went far beyond the normal relationship between lawyer and client.
He was able to counter police investigations as much as possible so that they could continue their criminal activities.
Mr Ditta has thus made his profession a disgrace.
He was too close to certain clients, especially Scarborough, and he allowed his independence to be compromised.
Ditta denied any wrongdoing and said, "If I were a corrupt lawyer, which I'm not, and I wanted to pass information on to Scarborough, I wouldn't wait 15 hours, but I would do it right away".
But after the hearing, Lancashire Police Superintendent Lee Halstead said: "Mr Ditta has gone from a criminal defense lawyer to a criminal criminal criminal the moment he started buying drugs from organized criminals".
His cocaine addiction led to a hopeless compromise and made him susceptible to the motives of leading members of organized crime who commissioned him to obtain valuable information about police investigations.
Lawyers must maintain the highest standards of integrity and ensure public confidence and confidence.
Ditta has betrayed this trust and tried to hide behind the facade of his profession.
The Lancashire Serious and Organised Crime Unit led the investigation into Ditta, which also resulted in a conviction in three counts of cocaine possession and obstruction of justice, underscoring our determination to bring criminals to justice.
This case should be a warning to criminals and show that no one can escape the rule of law.
We'll find you and bring you to justice.
Scarborough himself was sentenced to 14 years in prison after pleading guilty to conspiracy to commit heroin, cocaine and cannabis trafficking.
Thirty-five other persons involved in the drug trade were sentenced to a total of 153 years for drug offences.
On his website, Ditta posted a question and answer section about himself, stating that his dream job was to represent clients in America's death row as a lawyer, that his ultimate dinner guest was Mohammed Ali, and that inequality was the motivation for his work.
A revolutionary work of church music
To conclude the celebrations marking the 160th anniversary of its existence, the Dunningen Songcranz will frame two services with the "German Mass" by Franz Schubert.
After the great success of the musical "Rock my Life", which enthralled audiences in the spring of this year, the choir will enrich two services to conclude the anniversary year with the performance of Franz Schubert's German Mass.
On Saturday, October 26, this special Mass will be heard at the evening Mass at St. Martin's Church Dunningen from 7 p.m. and Sunday, October 27, at 10.15 a.m. at the service at St. John the Baptist Church in Lackendorf.
The so-called Deutsche Messe, originally titled "Songs to celebrate the sacred sacrifice of the Mass", D 872, is a spiritual musical work by the composer Franz Schubert from 1826 and was considered almost revolutionary at the time of its creation.
The Mass is held as part of the services, as the client Johann Philipp Neumann intended.
The choir is accompanied by the organist Frohsinn Tennenbronn and Noemi Lokodi.
Haslach: Skepticism is increasingly losing confidence
The parish council elections in 2015 will, for example, change fundamentally in the Haslach (SE) ward.
There will be only one common parish council for all six parishes.
In a joint meeting on Saturday, the committees of Haslach, Hofstetten, Mühlenbach, Fischerbach, Steinach and Welschensteinach prepared for the changes.
The Commission has already adopted a number of proposals for a directive on the protection of workers' rights in the Community.
The new approach has become more and more clear: skepticism is slowly weakened but confidence is growing.
From the ideas and expectations of the 2015 innovations to concrete proposals on the future composition and size of the parish council, the six committees had extremely constructive discussions with the main officials of the care team.
Regional Dean Georg Schmitt gave a presentation on the new guidelines for healthcare units in the Archdiocese of Freiburg.
The SE Haslach will then, as a church community, become a body governed by public law which will take on the rights and duties of the six individual churches.
There will only be a joint parish council and a foundation council in which the parish priest is represented.
Each parish shall be represented by at least two elected members, in which six parishes shall form local so-called community teams.
Their task in the future will be to promote church life in the village.
The question of the finances of each parish then showed a considerable need for discussion.
The new rules provide that funds raised in parishes will be kept to their intended purpose.
The liabilities, on the other hand, are transferred to the community as a whole.
There were particular concerns about the large investments planned, which would then be committed by all parishes.
"Even in the past, only projects were invested that could be managed by the individual parishes alone", said Bruno Prinzbach, Haslach's parish council president.
Barbar Knight, the chair of the board at the Schutterwald-Neuried mental health unit, described practical experience with a joint committee for five parishes.
They had set themselves the task of becoming one, remaining five in 2006 and had to realize that it wasn't that easy.
The Hasla Health Unit's committees then set out to answer questions about the future composition and size of the joint parish council and the practical work of the parish teams.
The work will be further elaborated on in future meetings and decided on at another joint meeting of all six committees next spring.
Finally, Michael Schöner, a parish councillor from Steinach, presented the new logo of the mental health unit, which was approved by a clear majority.
In Pfullendorf, electricity is getting more expensive
The citizens of Pfullendorf must adjust to higher electricity costs.
As the managing director of the urban works, Jörg-Arne Bias, confirmed to SÜDKURIER, an additional cost per year for a family of four in Pfullendorf is 70 to 90 euros.
The main reason for the upcoming price increase is the increase in the so-called EEG-surcharge from 5,277 to 6,3 cents per kilowatt-hour.
This enclosure is re-established each year in October by the four operators of the major power lines.
They calculate the additional costs they incur from the energy transition, which they can collect by overlaying the electricity price.
The town works of Pfullendorf form the last link in this chain.
The supervisory board of the energy company had even assumed a higher turnover in its forecasts, as reported by Jörg-Arne Bias.
The actual figures would now have to be calculated before the city authorities could inform their customers of the exact price increase next week.
"We're going to raise 1 cent plus x", Bias said, but the figure will be closer to 2 cents.
Light on Permanent Red: Watch for Waiting Time
Sometimes a light bulb just doesn't turn green.
The contact loop on the street is not responding, or the light sign is defective.
What do you do, drive on red?
If a person has waited long enough at a red light and the crossing is clear, he can continue", explains Stuttgart lawyer Ralf Becker in Motorcycle magazine.
However, the waiting time must be 'reasonable', which can be interpreted differently on a case by case basis.
Becker advises that you wait at least five minutes before you assume that the lamp is not working properly.
However, those who continue driving under the red lights must be aware that they are fully responsible for an accident caused by it.
If you have less than five minutes, you may not wait long enough, Becker warns, referring to a decision by the Hamm Superior Court.
In the case under discussion, a driver had ignored the flashlight after about three minutes of continuous red lighting and had to take responsibility for a negligent infringement of the red light.
The light was not damaged, but soon turned green.
He was spared a driving ban because of the special situation - but not the fine.
The Council welcomes a sound budget
Every time the city council met about the budget, Mayor Ralph Gerster laughed well.
The municipal bank in Herdwangen-Schönach is well filled and the administration has not had any debt since 2005.
The financial year 2012 can also be considered a successful one in this sense.
This was made clear in the presentation of the annual accounts for 2012.
As Andrea Rothmund explained, the administrative budget was about EUR 7.6 million, over EUR 1 million higher than planned.
The surplus of the administrative budget is also about EUR 1.8 million, about EUR 1 million above the approach.
The surplus is due mainly to higher sales tax revenue and the municipal share of income tax.
The budget was also well above the planned values.
Instead of the 1.5 million euro planned, it was 2.5 million euro last year.
'This is mainly due to the higher budgetary allocations,' Rothmund said.
As less investment than planned was made in the financial year 2012, the amount of reserves was also higher.
Overall, the general reserve was increased by around EUR 2.1 million to a total of EUR 4.9 million.
Mayor Ralph Gerster thanked Rothmund and her team for the good work.
"You can't just shake a piece like this off the handle", Gerster said, looking at the annual accounts.
He and the local councils were obviously pleased with the good numbers.
It may sound paradoxical, but these very good figures could soon be costing the citizens.
The good financial situation has allowed the municipality to avoid high levies in the past.
The Commission has already decided to take a decision on the basis of the information provided by the Commission.
These grants from various compensatory measures are subject to conditions.
The Commission has also proposed a new programme for the development of the European Community's financial system.
"We must look at the issue of leverage as we are looking at investments in the coming years for which we would like to receive grants", Gerster said.
Hugo Wermter has been in the choir for 60 years
With 60 years as a singer, Hubert Wermer's history with the men's choir Cäcilia is almost twice as long as that of the Autumn Festival, where he was solemnly honored.
Hubert Wermter stood on stage in the colours of his men's choir as usual.
Even after 60 years, he still enjoys singing with the now-loved choir.
Wermter was also active in the association, including 28 years as a member of the committee.
For his commitment and his devotion to the association he received several awards: Jörg Kohr, pastoral referent on behalf of the Cacilen Association Rottenburg-Stuttgart, presented him - as the choir is also a church choir - a certificate of the association and an honorary letter signed by Bishop Gebhard Fürst.
His singing colleagues handed him the German Choir Association's certificate and a graffiti meter.
In addition to the honour, the 31st Autumn Festival was held in the usual ways: the MGV Betra, the Salzstetten Singing Club, the Baisingen Singing Department and the local music association were the ones who introduced a colorful mix of different choirs and singing styles to the 400 visitors.
MGV Vollmaringen opened with such sentimental songs as "In the Wine Paradise" and "Enjoyment, Brothers".
They prepared a small statue in honour of their singer Hubert Wermter - Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart's "Bundeslied".
The men's choir Betra also sang classical choral songs such as "Jagerwerben" by Julius Wengert, "Far, Far Away" by Hubert Goisern and the folk song "When You Walk Through the Valley".
The Salzstetten choir, with its mixed choir and women's group - the "Impulsor" - provided the women's quota for the festival.
The mixed chorus with the Neapolitan folk song "Santa Lucia" and "Eviva Espana" by Antos Gus was taken to foreign countries, while the "Impulsor" also used foreign languages: "Liberatio" and "Hey Jude" were among their programmes.
The singing section of the Baisinger Sportverein returned to the local fields with "What Is the Schwob?" by Hans Süssmuth and Robert Pappert's "Beerlied", where the Vollmaringer Musicverein offered the crowning musical finale.
For the children, there was a small side program - "Oma Hanne" aka Hannelore Stollsteimer performed a Kasperl theater and read a few stories that the children enjoyed during the lunch.
Children's dreams come true
The kindergartens and daycare centres in the customs district are getting mail these days.
The Black Forest Boat wants to support the facilities in the realisation of their construction and decoration wishes in cooperation with the Bauhaus and the Sparkasse Zollernalb.
Does the kindergarten need a new sandbox?
All kindergartens, day-care centres and day-care centres in the customs territory of the Community may take part in the action.
If you have a design or decoration for your facility, you can apply with this one at the Black Forest messenger.
Be creative with your kids and surprise the jury of the Kindergarten construction site action.
A jury composed of representatives of Black Forest Bote, Bauhaus and Sparkasse Zollernalb shall select three wishes from all submissions.
What are the conditions for participation?
The request should be made with construction materials of a maximum value of EUR 2000 and in one (action) day.
In addition, the winner will have to provide for many hardworking construction workers.
What's it got to do with the day of action and the helpers?
Bauhaus is providing the material with the support of the Sparkasse Zollernalb.
It is delivered to the kindergarten on the agreed day and is then processed directly by the helpers.
Helpers can be parents, grandparents, friends, associations and, of course, the educators and children themselves.
Kenyan press outraged by controversial media law
We are in a frightening situation and one may ask: what is stopping Parliament from simply abolishing judicial independence tomorrow?, read in the newspaper that considers the draft law unconstitutional.
The law is draconian and highly punitive and we reject it said Cyrus Kamau, CEO of Capital Group, which also owns CapitalFM, one of Kenya's most respected independent radio stations and news websites.
He said the new media tribunal will always be biased because it is an extended arm of the government and restrictions on content and advertising would damage Kenya's position in the global economy.
"I hope the President will listen to us and we call on him to reject this bill and send it back to Parliament", he said.
According to The Star, the new law effectively strangles the media, but the Standard notes that democracy and freedom of expression in Kenya have suffered a "severe blow" and called the draft "draconian".
The passage of the law is part of a series of measures to strengthen national security following the September attacks by armed Islamists on the Westgate shopping centre.
The Kenyan media have drawn the ire of the authorities for posting security camera footage showing the units sent to the crime scene allegedly robbing the luxury shopping mall.
Police Chief David Kimaiyo responded by recruiting two journalists and a senior media official to interview him, even though the invitation was withdrawn after a media outcry.
Under the new law, media houses can be fined up to 20 million Kenyan shillings and individual journalists up to one million shillings, as well as the further risk of losing their professional recognition or being excluded from official press accreditation.
The Tribunal also has the right to seize the property of the persons concerned if a penalty is not paid.
According to the Daily Nation, even a single penalty could bankrupt most radio stations.
In addition, the paper believes that these measures could have a devastating impact on its description of Kenya's vibrant blogosphere.
If they shut down the media, politicians could do whatever they want with impunity.
No one will ever know, wrote Mutuma Mathiu, a journalist at Nation who called the Kenyan media a crucial control factor in public life.
Leaving politicians alone leads the country to bankruptcy and brings us back to the hunter-gatherers' era, he commented.
The Kenyan legislatures have already taken public anger on themselves in the past.
In May they voted to reverse the cuts ordered by the National Pay Commission and re-established their decent salaries of around 532,000 shillings a month tax-free  they are among the highest in the world.
Bad-Durrheim: A dream come true for the FC
The official opening ceremony of the art street sports ground was of no consequence to the city and the football club despite the cold weather and rain.
Everyone had probably wished for a more pleasant holiday on Saturday, but Peter did not want to play a part in it.
So all those who came without an umbrella or could not hold one for any reason had the look.
The musicians who framed the party were, as were many speakers.
The club's president, Albrecht Schlenker, was also a wet man, speaking of the fulfillment of a dream.
He thanked the mayor Walter Klumpp, who was very committed to the project, the local council, the companies involved and the members of the association who contributed.
This is Lothar Held, Paul Weizenegger, Heiner Gail and Peter Graf.
The retired workers laid 400 square metres of pavement for the new roads.
This remarkable volunteer effort was also appreciated by the Member of Parliament, Karl Rombach.
Further greetings were given to the city's sports committee by Hubert Baier, the district chairman of the South Badia Football Association, Kuno Kayan, and Friedrich Knorr of the Planning Office, who announced a donation to the club's youth section.
Mayor Klumpp reminded us that repeated weather-related influences in spring and autumn added to the original lawn so that it could not be played.
The first considerations for solving the problem were given 15 years ago when the idea of building a third place on the grounds of the football club or the real school on the Salt Lake was conceived.
Both were rejected again.
Six years ago, the idea of a playground for artistic sports came up, and it was widely considered the ultimate solution.
The concrete plans were drawn up two years ago when the FC took over the lease of the shed, agreed to a cost contribution of EUR 100 000 for the construction of the square and the Land approved funding of EUR 104 000.
In October 2012, the City Council decided to take over the remaining EUR 356 000 at a total cost of EUR 560 000, summarised by Klumpp.
The construction of the 68 by 108 metre art street square began on 4 June.
During the three-month construction phase, 3,000 cubic metres of soil were removed, half of which was used to build a dirt bike track.
The Union and the SPD have continued their coalition negotiations on the issues of the internal affairs and justice.
The working group for this purpose met in Berlin this morning.
The Commission has already decided to take a decision on the proposal for a directive on the protection of the environment.
In the morning, the Migration and Integration Working Party also wanted to continue its deliberations.
The Commission has already decided to take a decision on the proposal for a directive on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to the marketing of certain products.
The SPD wants to end the compulsion for German-born immigrant children to choose one - the Union rejects a double passport.
On the issue of transport, which is not on the agenda of this Friday, the SPD has said no to a car tariff requested by the CSU.
A vignette is a 'flavour for multirail and thus environmentally counterproductive', explained the SPD's transport negotiator, Florian Pronold, in a letter to his group.
There was a risk of evasive traffic on rural roads, which are already accidents.
The introduction of a duty on all cars would also be only a first step in Pronolds' view.
"There is a risk that the German compensation will be cancelled at a later date", he said.
Dieter Thomas Kuhn in Stuttgart: The singing Föhnwelle on the open stage
Stuttgart - "When will summer be real again?" was not really the question on Friday night at the Killesberg open-air stage.
It was indeed a tropical night in Stuttgart.
So the best conditions for hit star Dieter Thomas Kuhn and his band.
Click through the gallery to pick up the "singing Föhnwelle".
Motorist seriously injured in accident
In an accident on Thursday evening, a 37-year-old driver from Aachen was seriously injured.
Police said a 41-year-old woman was driving her car into Grefrath at about 9:15 p.m.
When she was about to turn left on St. Tony's Road, she overlooked the 37-year-old's car.
The tires collided.
The Aachen resident suffered serious injuries and had to be taken to the hospital for treatment.
Constance: Lock after accident on the railway track
The accident occurred when a 51-year-old driver of a Swiss seat Ibiza was driving on the left-hand side of the two-lane Reichstraße outside the city on Thursday evening, at about 8 p.m., police said.
Shortly before the traffic on the railway, he noticed that he was on the left-hand side of the road towards Stromeyersdorfstraße and switched to the right-hand side.
The collision occurred with the BMW of a 23-year-old Constance driver.
The 19-year-old driver of the BMW was also damaged.
In total, about 15,000 property damage was reported, police said.
The road had to be closed during the shooting, it was said.
Vienna Airport cancels passenger calls
Mr. Max Maier, please come to Gate 24.
There will be no more promises like this at Vienna-Schwechat airport.
This will reduce much of the noise in the speaker - and this will reduce the noise level significantly.
The aim of this innovation is to create a more relaxed atmosphere.
As airport spokesman Peter Kleemann told Radio Wien, the termination of individual advertisements at Vienna Airport follows an international trend.
The Commission has already decided to extend the scope of the proposal to the Member States.
The elimination of these promises - an average of about 200 personal calls per day from the speakers - will make the airport more secure in the future.
"It has also been shown in experience that these individual announcements were relatively little perceived, but at the same time all other information on altered flight boardings or departure times is also somewhat lost here", Kleemann said in an interview with the radio station.
Highlander games at the Kaltenhof
In addition to the tractor-tractor brake car pull, there will be a second competition at the Kaltenhof Agricultural Autumn Festival from 6 to 8 September.
On Saturday, September 7th, the Highlander games start at 1:30 p.m.
They have a Scottish tradition, but they're a swampy brew in the cold.
Teams and individual competitors compete in the disciplines of tree trunk throwing, horseshoe throwing and water-dressing.
The trunk is four and a half feet long and weighs 25 to 30 kilograms.
"It's not about the scale", explains organizer Peter Saile.
The trunk must be thrown upright, overturned once, and then laid down.
That's the highest score.
When throwing horseshoes, it's about the accuracy of the target.
From eight meters away, it's thrown into a trap.
Competence and strength must be demonstrated by the participants when carrying a water weight above 50 metres.
Time and water in a bottle are measured at the end.
Two of each clan or team may then enter the individual competition.
The winners of the team and individual competitions will receive prizes.
You can start training at 10 a.m.
A suitable dress is desirable, for example, competitors may compete in the Scottish dress.
But Swabian dress is also allowed.
For "Outfit", the jury still gives you a few bonus points.
You can register up to an hour before the competition starts.
With the Scottish-Swabian Highland Games and the tractor pulling, which starts half an hour early, there's already a lot of action on the ground on Saturday.
In the evening, the fans of the music come at their own expense.
At 7 p.m., the birrah-bohemian wind music from Schömberg will shape the great evening of entertainment.
The chapel plays great polkas and marches.
But her repertoire also includes sentimental waltzes and a rich big band sound.
Heinz Koch, known as the singing host and black-swallow baron, will be with us for a while.
He's already performed at the Christmas market and the Fool's Nest in Dornhan.
On Sundays, the music club hosts leinstetten for breakfast, from 2 p.m. the Bauernkapelle Böffingen is a guest, and the "Oldies" then end the party.
The stop-scooter party with DJ Ralf is starting on Friday.
Other items on the programme include the old-timers' and tractor's meetings on Saturday and Sunday, exhibitions of companies on agriculture and forestry.
Other Sunday attractions include the corn maze, the craftsman's market, and the sheep shearing.
Especially for children there is a zoo, a straw-jumping fort, tractor riding (under guidance) and tractor surfing.
The organisers are the multi-purpose sports club, the ski club and the tractor club "Flame Capsules".
Milk and egg alternatives in the overview
Vegetarian diets require plant alternatives to eggs, milk and dairy products.
For example, tofu with plant plums is a quartz substitute.
The World Vegan Day is also being declared by the Vegetarian Federation on November 1.
The Vegetarian Federation Germany is proposing a number of vegan alternatives on the occasion of World Vegan Day on 1 November:
Pure plant margarine is a good alternative to butter, so substitute soy yogurt for yogurt.
Instead of milk, soybean, oatmeal, almond or rice milk may be used.
The use of a single plant is not a problem.
There are also plant alternatives to eggs.
A half-crushed, ripe banana, for example, can replace an egg as a binder in a cake.
50 grams of apple cider vinegar or a tablespoon of ground flaxseed plus three tablespoons of water are also suitable.
For example, dough is made looser with a mixture of a teaspoon of baking powder, a tablespoon of starch and three tablespoons of mineral water.
But even 50 grams of soybean yogurt or silk soup can serve that purpose.
According to the Vebu, about 800 000 people in Germany are currently eating vegan, i.e. purely vegetarian.
Sleepless in New York
On their way to their host families in Weymouth, Massachusetts, students at Black Forest High School learned about the American city of New York.
After eight hours of flight, the plane was on its way to the Brooklyn Bridge, which reached the heart of Manhattan on foot.
Here, we already had a fascinating look at the world-famous skyline, which is particularly attractive in the evening light.
The time shift meant the students were on their feet for almost 24 hours, but true to the motto "The City Never Sleeps", the day was decided at Times Square.
Despite the shutdown, the Statue of Liberty was reached on the second day by ferry and climbed on foot.
Then, we went over the financial center on Wall Street to the 9/11 Memorial.
On the third day, students were able to gain a glimpse of the fascinating city from the Empire State Building's 1,300-foot-tall viewing platform and enjoy the view.
Then it was the hectic drive through the streets of New York City to Central Park, which offered an ideal opportunity for a short stay in the autumn sun.
After a short flight from New York to Boston, the students have now arrived at their host families and are experiencing the school day at Weymouth High School.
Also this year, on Saint Hubert's Day, a Hubertus Mass is celebrated in the parish church of St. Mary on Hülsbergstraße.
St. Hubertus was the legend of a rather ruthless hunter who was converted by a vision and later appointed Bishop of Lüttich.
The Westphalian group of hunter-gatherers, led by Brigitte Kluth, plays on parforce horns (natural horns in the mood of It) to old, originally French tunes.
The blasters wear horse-drawn clothing because they accompany horses, horses, and dog sleds on trail hunting.
The solemn mass will be held on Sunday, November 3 at 11.30 a.m.
The newly designed opshlush shines with a new cafe.
One that invites you to stay and come back.
One that wants to make a name for itself.
Dejà Vu is a psychological phenomenon that is expressed in the feeling of having experienced or seen a new situation before.
Visiting the cafe of the same name on the outskirts of the town of Kleve, in view of the University of Rhine-Waal, is not bound to be a mere Déjà Vu.
After all, the café with this beautiful name has exactly that goal: to make a real stay not only thoughtful but handy and repeated.
Because it's fun and it's just beautiful.
A look into the interior life at Option 8 immediately gives the viewer a good feeling.
The state-of-the-art, but not cool, café environment looks like a place to feel good.
Here, the team with founders Mirjam van der Stelt and Daniel Büttner at the top, spoons the guest with a variety of coffee or cocktail variants.
And then there's delicious cake or individually coated fresh baguettes.
The owners, both 33 years old, have already made a name for themselves as gastronomes before the opening of the ornate café on the outskirts of town: in Kranenburg they ran the "Art Lounge".
From moving to Kleve to the Opslag, the sympathetic coffee lovers are hoping for more audiences.
And last but not least, through college.
"Where we do not have a specific target group", says Daniel Büttner.
Rather, these two would like to address young students as much as seniors and all age groups in between.
Speaking of coffee lovers.
The friendly owner couple is behind the coffee enjoyment.
Enjoy the fragrant hot brew in the most varied variations yourself.
Other, of a thickness of not more than 10 mm
Daniel Büttner is more of an espresso fan and Mirjam van der Stelt is the cappuccino drinker.
"A baguette for that - that's my thing", she tells the NRZ.
There's been two events in the light cafe.
I'd rather have one.
Because the harbour festival was more outdoors - the Café Déjà Vu didn't benefit.
But there was also the ring night.
"Beautiful, successful and funny", the 33-year-old said.
But not everyone's business.
Perhaps that's why Daniel Büttner is not a big fan of event nights.
And with an event, I always only address those who are interested in the special event.
That's why events are more likely to be the exception.
"We want to disrupt the normal operation as little as possible".
I mean, Déjà Vu also stands for reliability.
As for the quality of the products offered here, as well as the team and the beautiful surroundings at the Kleve depot.
The street that's becoming more and more a restaurant district.
To the delight of many Klever, the guests from near and far, and the students who discover the gastronomic mile and, therefore, the Café Déjà Vu for themselves.
The following table shows the results of the evaluation:
A day of thanksgiving at the MGV in Dinker
It was the 165th foundation celebration that the MGV "Friedrich Wilhelm Dinker" had invited to this year and 52 guests, active singers and their wives, were happy to attend.
In the clubhouse of the "Witteborg" restaurant in Dinker, everyone enjoyed the harmonious coexistence in the spirit of music.
Traditionally, the Foundation Day is always the appropriate celebration to pay tribute.
This time, the writer Rolf Wagener was delighted to receive the special award "Songwriter of the Year".
"You not only wrote a lot for us, but you also shot so many rounds for us, for which we thank you very much", says the chairman of the choir Erich Schlotmann.
The awards for participation in the performances and choral rehearsals by means of activity tracks went to the choirmaster Dieter Schulze with 44 entries this year, followed by the honorary chairman Horst Pier-Ribbert, the chairman himself, and last year's "Singer of the Year" Friedrich Winkler with 42 entries each.
The fifth place was taken by the central defender Artur Brückner.
The board of directors expressed its special thanks to the team of the club's hostess Ange Pier-Ribbert, who once again enchanted an extra-class menu, and to Gerda Pier-Ribbert for the table decoration.
The MGV "Friedrich-Wilhelm" meets for its regular choral rehearsals every Tuesday at 7.45pm at the club's premises.
"New singing voices are always welcome", says Schlotmann.
UN announces new targets for poverty alleviation
The United Nations is now beginning to develop a series of new targets to replace the Millennium Development Goals for the fight against poverty announced 12 years ago.
In the run-up to the UN Summit on Sustainable Development, which began in Rio de Janeiro on Thursday evening, Australian diplomats played a key role in pushing for the 'Sustainable Development Goals' to replace the 2015 Millennium Goals.
They were included in the final draft of the document to be adopted by world political leaders, including Mrs Gillard, at the summit.
At the summit in the evening, UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon declared that the time had come to think more about national interests.
I am pleased that the Member States have agreed to embark on a process to agree on the universal sustainable development goals he said.
These targets will build on our progress towards the Millennium Development Goals and form an integral part of the post-2015 development framework.
I will make every effort to implement this mandate given to me by the Member States to achieve our vision of the Sustainable Development Goals, which builds on the success of the Millennium Goals.
Even though SG Achim/Baden has been undefeated for four days, the handball superlegislators still have a good mood.
Coach Tomasz Malmon has no doubt about that.
Everyone is still fully motivated by the cause.
Still, I hope we finally win again.
"Because I don't know what a win like this tastes like anymore", Malmon expects his team to experience success at VfL Fredenbeck II.
Although the third-tier reserve from Fredenbeck has not yet cleared trees, Malmon raises his index finger warning in advance.
I've coached a lot of players myself in the A-League.
So I'm sure they'll be particularly motivated against their former coach.
"It is also necessary to wait to see if there is further reinforcement from the first stage", explains the SG-Coach.
To finally get back on track, the Malmon team will have to step up from their previous performances.
The last thing I did was cover up and switchover.
The use of opportunities must also definitely improve.
So I hope my players have finally got their heads cleared during the short break.
Security concerns in Mozambique are growing amid clashes between high-profile figures
Thousands of people gathered in Maputo's center under the watchful eyes of the statue of Samora Machel, the founder and first president of Mozambique, to voice a rare public demonstration calling for peace.
"We want peace again, we want stability", said Vanessa de Sousa, managing director of an investment firm.
Fearing for the future of the country, she traded her business clothes for a T-shirt with the words "We demand security" in Portuguese and joined the crowd on Thursday in the capital's Independence Square.
For two weeks now, there have been reports almost daily of clashes between government forces and Renamo, one of the worst fighting since the peace agreement over 20 years ago.
Renamo was once a notorious rebel movement, initially supported by white-ruled Rhodesia and later by South Africa's apartheid government in an effort to destabilize the country's independent government.
Following the 1992 peace treaty, it became an opposition party.
Analysts believe it unlikely that the country will ever return to full-blown conflict, but recent events have alarmed foreign investors and locals alike.
The rapidly growing economy is at stake because the discovery of huge gas deposits off the coast and coal deposits in the northwest could bring in over $50 billion in investment from companies like Rio Tinto, Vale in Brazil, Eni in Italy and Anadarko in the US in the coming years.
The ruling Frelimo Party, the dominant force since 1975, and Renamo blame each other for the tensions.
Renamo claims that the government provoked the latest clashes by attacking its members in the province of Sofala, a traditional stronghold of Renamos, on 17 October.
The attacks on the former rebels escalated as government forces attacked Renamo bases and tried to kill Afonso Dhlakama, the group's leader, Renamo's spokesman told the Financial Times.
The government blames Renamo for the clashes and accuses the organization of attacking soldiers.
President Armando Guebuza has tried to minimize concerns about instability.
He told AFP on Wednesday that Dhlakama considered himself a "loser" who wants to use all his remaining strength to prove he can force his decisions on the government.
Both Frelimo and Renamo insist they want to avoid war.
But concerns have grown since Mazanga was quoted as saying Renamo would abandon the 1992 peace agreement.
He explained to FT that he meant that Frelimo no longer respected the agreement.
"Our vision is to resume negotiations seriously", Mazanga said.
The Commission has also been able to take a decision on the implementation of the new rules on the protection of workers' rights.
We have two grown men here (Guebuza and Dhlakama) who are bracing together says Joseph Hanlon, lecturer at the Open University and expert on Mozambique.
None of them are good at negotiating and none of them are willing to make the necessary concessions.
Renamo, which is pushing for electoral reforms, has already declared that it will boycott the November municipal elections.
Presidential and parliamentary elections are scheduled for next year.
Some commentators have interpreted the use of force as an attempt by a disruptive movement to obtain concessions and financial benefits from the government.
Renamo's electoral successes have been shrinking since 1992, while a new party, the Movimento Democrático de Moçambique (MDM), founded by a former Renamo member, is likely to improve in the elections.
Mazanga claims that Guebuza is about to resign if his second term ends next year to destroy the country's democracy.
He does not want a multiparty democracy, he does not want transparent elections, he does not want peace because he does not want to give up the presidency, Mazanga said.
It is unclear what capacity Renamo has, but it has carried out unrest-ridden attacks on police stations and vehicles on an important north-south route.
Most of the fighting took place in the province of Sofala, which is located a few hundred kilometers north of Maputo, but is also home to Beira, the port used by mining companies such as Rio Tinto and Vale to export coal.
In June, Rio suspended the use of the railway for a month after Renamo announced an attack on the track.
Mazanga replied with a reserved response to the question of whether Renamo would repeat this threat.
Renamo wanted to warn the international community that things are not going well in Mozambique, Mazanga said.
The instability has added to the frustration with the government, says Fernando Lima, head of Mediacoop, an independent media company, because many people were already worried about corruption, the slow progress in development, and a recent wave of kidnappings.
People think that the government and the president are responsible for the future of the country and that they should be the ones to find solutions to the problems, he explains.
Omar Sultan, a protester, said the people just wanted stability.
No one cares about Renamo and Frelimo, they just want peace and usable roads, he explained.
Children should be taught myths and legends as "examples for life", says one author.
The stories of Thor showed that brute force has no chance against clever tricks, and the legend of Arthur demonstrates the importance of having a dream.
Many of the myths, however, were far too wild, too offensive and in some cases too dirty to be taught in schools, and Crossley-Holland advocated a careful selection of age-appropriate works.
"I find it wonderful that in America myths and folklore are already part of education", he said.
I've been proposing this as a plan for 20 years.
He added that with authors and teachers who were "overly didactic", children would "completely shut down" because entertaining stories would "under-train" the message.
Crossley-Holland, who translated Beowulf from Anglo-Saxon and is the author of the Penguin Book of Norse Myths and the British Folk Tales, explained: "You can pursue certain intentions, but you should keep them in the background as much as possible".
Perhaps the biggest difference between an adult author who writes for adults and an author who writes for children is the need to convey hope.
Not everything needs to be simplified or lead to a happy ending, but there is an inherent sense of good and evil.
It must be subtle, revealed by history and not explained.
It's the old story of showing instead of telling.
Hansjakob moves to Freihard again
One hundred years ago, Heinrich Hansjakob moved his retirement home to Haslach, and on Sunday his last years were spent in the Freihort.
The many spectators were enthusiastic about the extremely short-sighted scene.
From his arrival to the award of honorary citizenship to his death, screenwriter and Hansjakob actor Alois Kraftzcyk had designed an entertaining play that received much praise under the direction of Cornelia Volk.
Marcus Zagermann took the audience through the ten different scenes as a speaker, explaining connections and bridging time jumps from youth to the impending retirement.
On October 22, 1913, Hansjakob returns home to his childhood home, his yard.
And then the scene began, in which Alois Krafczyk once again shone in his parador role as the great son of the city.
He drove a stiletto with the double-barreled and "Black Forest Foxes" by Erich Becherer of Mühlenbach.
Not only was he received with much applause by the audience, but his sister, Philippine, also welcomed him.
Billy Sum-Hermann was incredibly good at getting into the role of the sister and giving her a huge life in gestures and mimics.
Between the individual play scenes, the Mühlenbacher Bauernkapelle played appropriately selected pieces of music and rounded off the performance.
The honour of citizenship was then conferred on Haslach's mayor Heinz Winkler, who attended the meeting on behalf of the then office holder Hättich along with a part of the city council.
Their attendance was then made by the Three Kings singers, who caused Hansjakob to exclaim: "Oh, how beautiful, then, youthful memories of my own Three Kings time come alive again".
With their song "O Jesulein", they delighted the audience in the open courtyard as well as the storky daybirds with their loud "Heraus, Heraus".
His criticism of the official church at the time was as much expressed as his concerns about the outcomes in agriculture, the consequences of industrialization, or the effects of war.
In the home courtyard, behind his tomb chapel on the fire at Hofstetten, he found his resting place.
"A restless spirit had finally found its rest and had gone home forever", the scene concluded.
There were many applause and praise from the audience for the performance.
Basketball: The Neckar Giants' Hope is Growing
The chances of the Ludwigsburg Bundesliga basketball players who have retired from sports have increased.
Because if there was a wildcard procedure, there's less competition for the Neckar giants now.
The Hamburg Towers basketball project has waived an application for a possible relegation spot.
"We will not participate in the Wildcard process", said former national player Pascal Roller, who has been developing the concept for a professional club in the city of Hanover since 2012.
A first breath was nevertheless not heard from Ludwigsburg.
"We did not deal with the Wildcard process until it was established that Düsseldorf does not receive a license", Neckar's giant boss Alexander Reil told our newspaper.
The German clubs have been able to take part in the competition in the Bundesliga.
The Rhineland has been denied the licence twice.
The arbitral tribunal is the final court.
Haigerhole: The Church of the Eucharist is coming to the spotlight
As a contribution to the city's 150th anniversary of the Evangelical Church in Haigerloch, the city's Culture and Tourism Office will dedicate its final public address this year to the Church of the Eucharist on Sunday, October 27.
After visiting the Atomkeller Museum, the Haigerloch period after 1850 when Haigerloch came under Prussian rule is to be considered.
A final point is a visit to the church of the Eucharist.
There, the guests will be told the story of the church's construction and gain insight into the evolution of the evangelical community in a Catholic area.
Last but not least, the church also has a view of the evening painting by Friedrich Schüz with the support of Walter Kröll and Georg Halbritter.
It is a faithful reproduction of the famous Milanese model of Leonardo da Vinci.
The meeting point for the two-and-a-half-hour tour is at the Atomkeller Museum at 3 p.m.
There are maps at the Nuclear Cellar Museum.
For questions and information, the tourism office of the city of Haigerloch is available.
Snowden could testify in Russia
Former US intelligence expert Edward Snowden could also testify in US intelligence in his Russian asylum.
Representatives of the Federal Attorney General could either ask questions in writing or meet the 30-year-old in person in Russia.
The Interfax Agency reported this, citing unnamed circles familiar with the situation.
It was said that such a question could be settled intergovernmentally.
A trip by Snowden from Russia is virtually impossible.
"In this case, he loses his refugee status", the agency quoted its source as saying.
Because Germany is an ally of the United States, Snowden is threatening extradition there.
Longer breathing pays off
Six men's teams competed in the club tennis tournament for the title.
In the end, the endurance of Team Maier/Bronner decided the last match.
A dream weather had been received by the sports clubs' tennis department Rohrdorf for the local clubs and friends' tournament.
The fun of tennis was the focus of the tournament.
There were five games per team on the plan, with each playing against each other.
Played in double mode with a long set up to nine points or a maximum duration of 45 minutes.
Anja Schlichter is running the tournament.
The tournament was run by Anja Schlichter, supported by Carmen Müller and Inga Kronemeyer.
After the first three games and a lunch break with pasta, the tournament went into the decisive phase.
The favourites Andre Maier/Matthias Bronner were tied with Michael Klippel and Sadmin Osmicic (both SG Rohrweiler teams), so the final two matches had to decide.
At the award ceremony, Carmen Müller was finally able to hand over the Wandercup to Andre Maier/Matthias Bronner, who had the longest breath on the finish line.
The second place was taken by Michael Klippel/Sadmin Osmicic.
The bronze staircase was reached by Rainer and Bernd Maier of the asphalt dryer team.
Late afternoon sunshine and coffee and cake gave the tournament its successful tone.
Last August, the Black Forest Museum in Gutach near Hornberg is back in the hands of children.
Traditionally, the museum welcomes visitors to a colorful children's and family festival with numerous activities and events on Saturday and Sunday, August 24 and 25.
"Big and small can learn different old crafts on both days", the press release says.
Whether making soap, turning candles, twisting or making ropes, there is the right thing to do for every age.
Regional craftsmen are there to help the children from 11 a.m. to 5 p.m.
The museum's workshop is also working.
When building cuckoo pipes, water wheels or circles, young guests can prove their skill.
Many old games, such as chariot racing and wheelchair running, also promise much fun.
Speed and coordination are what's needed here.
For all small detectives, the open-air museum offers a mystery tour of the museum on Saturday and Sunday at 12 noon and 2 p.m.
On a roller coaster, the children must guess which stories are true or false.
In addition, visitors have the special opportunity to get to know the open-air museum during a carriage ride with foxes in the Black Forest.
Not only horses but also many other animals such as sheep, goats, cows, and chickens are to be found and admired on the grounds.
In addition, all children can look forward to the clown otsch on Sunday, who will be playing his clown neck with the museum guests from 11 a.m.
It's a comfortable and fairy tale, but it's about Hermann Büttner.
The storyteller takes the little guests into the wonderful world of fairy tales at 11, 13 and 15.
In addition, the children's dance group from Gutach performs traditional dances at 11.30 a.m.
In addition, on both days of the event, from 11 a.m. to 5 p.m., numerous craftsmen such as the broom-binder, the seamstress, the spinner, the weaver and the baker can be seen doing their traditional work.
The visitors to the open-air museum are still waiting for a varied holiday programme until the end of the summer holidays in Baden-Württemberg.
In a small New Zealand town, Burt Muro is considered a beloved horse because he decided to take part in a race in America on his motorcycle, built in 1920.
Burt's heart is broken, but he can't stop his dream.
With his savings, a couple of donations and a mortgage on his old hardware store, he's sailing to Los Angeles.
After the movie, there's coffee, tea and cake.
The pitches of the shrill disturb the inhabitants
Rhenus Midgard has also invested heavily in land.
They're distributing the coal coming from the ships.
The company has several iron in the fire at the same location.
In addition to coal imports, Rhenus Midgard also relies on wind turbine logistics.
Black is shading the coal on the storage site in front of the pond.
Two huge blue coal-fired and charging machines distribute or load the coal here as needed.
Every time the equipment moves, a loud warning sounds across the field.
"The signals are for security and are required by law", says Matthias Schrell, Managing Director of Rhenus Midgard in Wilhelmshaven.
Unfortunately, this is widely heard in the event of bad winds - and there have already been some complaints from people from the north of the city.
He takes the complaints very seriously and has therefore contacted the victims, says the 40-year-old.
In close cooperation with the authorities, the warning signals are now being kept down by technical measures.
He will continue to engage in open dialogue with his neighbors.
Because Matthias Schrell has a lot of things to do on the site.
With the expansion of the Lower Saxony Bridge, Rhenus Midgard continues to rely on coal imports for power plants and is one of the largest in Europe in this sector.
Thanks to the 18.5 m deep storage tank in front of the terminal, Capesize can be used for bulk carriers.
"This year we want to break the 3-million-ton mark in packaging", said Schrell.
In addition to the Eon power plant on the ground, coal imports are used in domestic power plants.
If the GDF-Suez power plant is connected, it will be realistic to import 5 million tonnes of coal a year.
The three shiploads on the bridge and the second transport band could hold up to 10 million.
Bayern basketball player optimistic despite first defeat
Even the first defeat in the Euroleague did not diminish the huge optimism among the FC Bayern Munich basketball players.
"No one can stop us from believing that we will win against the best team in Europe in the last two years", Bayern coach Svetislav Pesic said after the unfortunate 83:88 (39:47) on Thursday night at Olympiakos Piraeus.
We sent the message: basketball exists in Munich too!
The Munichers were very successful in their third European appearance, but they were not clear enough during the crucial stages.
The guests first managed to turn a 15-point lead into a lead 13 minutes before the end before Piraeus turned the game around again.
"We fought back incredibly against the two-time Euroleague champion, but then made slight mistakes again", said Bayern professional Yassin Idbihi.
We're proud of what we've accomplished, but we want to win every game.
Malcolm Delaney and Nihad Djedovic were the most successful pitchers of the Munich team, having won the first two games against Italian series champion Montepaschi Siena and Polish title-bearer Zielona Góra.
Ten years of New York comedy festival The New Yorker
You could say New York City is the birthplace of stand-up comedy in America: Nearly a hundred years ago, the variety artist Frank Fay, who worked as a talk show host at the Palace Theatre on Broadway, began telling the crowd straight up in the form of a conversation.
Over the years, Fays' innovation has expanded, as recently as the New York Comedy Festival.
Founded and led by Caroline Hirsch, founder of the stand-up institution Carolines, the festival is celebrating its 10th anniversary this year with over sixty shows in small clubs and big theaters.
"Most of these headliners started with Carolines and then became more and more successful until they became too famous to perform in a club", Hirsch said.
We designed this festival so we can continue to work with them.
This year's event features performances by Wanda Sykes, Kathy Griffin and Bill Maher as well as Stand Up for Heroes, an annual music and comedy benefit event for Army veterans at Madison Square Garden, featuring Bruce Springsteen, Jon Stewart, Roger Waters and Bill Cosby.
The festival has also brought the world of comedy to life.
A number of the comedians participating in the festival this year have become known through more unconventional channels, such as shows on smaller television channels such as Comedy Central, FX and Spike.
Nick Kroll became known for a sitcom on cable television (the ironically sloppy fantasy football series The League on FXX) and now has his own sketch show on Comedy Central.
Jenny Slate was part of the cast of both Saturday Night Live and Parks and Recreation, although she is best known for her viral video series Marcel the Shell with Shoes On.
Both Kroll and Slate and other young comedians with characteristic voices (the surreal pessimistic Anthony Jeselnik, the ironic, racially focused W. Kaumau Bell) are products of the decentralized world of American comedy.
One of the biggest visitors to the festival is an interview with Larry David.
Steinberg began as a stand-up comedian, but has since developed into a respected television and film director as well as an unofficial comedy historian.
From 2005 to 2007 he hosted a television show titled Sit Down Comedy with David Steinberg on TV Land.
The meeting will be held at Town Hall in the middle of Manhattan.
"The city is definitely in the comedy DNA of Larry's entire body of work", Steinberg said.
He told me that when he's here, he sometimes walks down the alley between two buildings and thinks, "Hey, if I lose all my money, maybe I'll live here".
Iran is satisfied with the nuclear negotiation process
Iran is pleased with the negotiating process a week before the next nuclear meeting with the five UN veto powers and Germany.
"After years, an agreement has now been reached with the International Atomic Energy Agency to close the gaps of recent years", Foreign Minister Mohammed D'Chawad Sarif wrote on his Facebook page.
It would be a long way off, but the nuclear dealership is satisfied with the negotiating process and optimistic that both sides will eventually come to a solution.
Drama in Uruguay: Boys kill their comrades with machetes
Two children in Uruguay have confessed to the murder of an 11-year-old.
The two boys, ages 14 and 12, had invited their victims to go bird hunting with them.
Armed with machetes and knives, they stabbed the 11-year-old on Tuesday and dumped the body in a well, the newspaper "El País" reported on Thursday.
Then they would have played football in a working-class neighborhood outside their homes.
The body was found the following night in the village of Cerro Pelado, 15 kilometers north of the exclusive beach town of Punta del Este.
As an alibi, a five-year-old half-sister of the younger who had taken them with her was to testify that she was sexually assaulted by the boy.
But when the girl told the police about the killing without mentioning an attack on her, the two boys admitted to the intentional killing of the 11-year-old.
The older man cited a rivalry in the game of football as one of the reasons.
He was temporarily committed to a mental institution.
A pimp is sent to prison
For exploitative human trafficking, pimping, threats, insults and dangerous bodily harm, the Constance County Court sentenced a 33-year-old man from St. George to three and a half years in prison.
The former German soldier, who served as a doorman in Afghanistan after two deployments, made a confession in a trial.
In five cases, he met women via Internet or telephone contacts, which he then turned down after a few weeks against their will.
He used to break resistance with violence and threats.
He kept the income of the women who bought some for him for years.
By confiscating cell phones and SIM cards, he cut off women's contacts to the outside world.
Along with a colleague who brokered the women, he took them to various brothels in the southwest.
There he had them monitored in part to control their income.
In court, the defendant initially claimed that he was suffering from severe trauma after colleagues in Afghanistan died in an explosion alongside him.
After a psychiatrist raised serious doubts about the mental limitation and thus limited guilt, the 33-year-old made a full confession.
The court didn't have to hear any more of the damaged women.
According to a Kripo official, at least four other cases of exploitative human trafficking were detected by telephone surveillance following an initial report.
The intercepted conversations were marked by high levels of aggression.
In later interrogations, the victims confirmed their martyrdom.
Another witness, who discovered blue spots all over the woman's body, has not testified to date.
It is a "totally broken personality" that violence and exploitation in this profession is considered normal.
The defendant regretted his behavior yesterday.
"He has broken free from these circles and wants to live a normal life after prison", he said.
Oil prices continue to drop to $ 96 a barrel
Oil prices continued to fall on Friday after concerns about high supply overshadowed a report that China's energy-hungry manufacturing sector is growing.
The reference crude oil supply for December fell by 14 cents to USD 96.24 per barrel in the late morning in Europe in electronic trading at the New York Mercantile Exchange.
The contract fell 39 cents on Thursday, which was a 5.8 percent drop in October.
The large supply of crude oil has weighed on prices in recent weeks.
The U.S. Department of Energy said Wednesday that U.S. supply increased by 4.1 million barrels last week.
In the course of five weeks, the supply had increased by 25 million barrels.
However, on Friday, there was evidence of stronger demand from two reports of increased activity in Chinese manufacturing.
This indicates a continued recovery of China's economy, which grew to 7.8 percent in the third quarter after reaching its lowest level in two decades in the previous quarter.
Brent crude, a benchmark for international crude oil, also used by US refineries, fell 26 cents on the London ICE Exchange to $108.58 a barrel.
Court blocks decision on the NYPD's stop and fridge directive
A federal appeals court in the United States blocked an order from a judge on Thursday demanding changes to the New York Police Department's Stop and Frisk program and dismissed the judge from the case.
The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit has declared that Judge Shira Scheindlin's decisions will be suspended until an appeal by the city is decided.
The judge ruled in August that the city violated the constitution by implementing the program to detain and interrogate people.
The City appealed against its assessment and the appropriate remedies, including the decision to set up a monitoring body to assist the police in amending its directive and its training programme.
The Court of Appeal heard the arguments for the requested suspension on Tuesday.
The appeal report stated that the judge must be dismissed for breaching the Code of Conduct for US judges by stipulating that a judge should avoid the appearance of bias, partly on the basis of a series of media interviews and public statements in which she had publicly responded to the court's criticism.
The judge had ruled that police officers violated the civil rights of tens of thousands of people by targeting black and Latin American men in an inappropriate manner with the Stop and Frisk program.
It appointed an external body to monitor the implementation of major changes, including reforms to policies, training and service oversight, and ordered a pilot programme with body-worn cameras in the districts where most controls were carried out.
In August, the City of New York agreed to end the practice of storing the names and addresses of individuals who were released after a police check.
The Commission considers that the Commission is not in a position to take any further steps to ensure that the measures are implemented in a manner that is compatible with the internal market.
The stop-and-frisk tactic has been criticized by a number of civil rights activists.
Controls of this kind have existed in various forms for decades, but the number of recorded controls during the tenure of the nonpartisan mayor Michael Bloomberg rose to an all-time high of 684,330 in 2011, most of them black and Latin American men.
In 2004, four men, all of whom were minorities, filed a complaint which became a class action lawsuit.
Supporters of changes to the NYPD's Stop and Frisk program say the changes will end unfair practices and create a more trusted and effective police force, as well as affect the way other police departments implement the regulation.
Opponents say the changes would dampen police morale but not crime; they would also waste money and not solve the broader problem of a police force under pressure after thousands of jobs were lost in the last decade.
The judge pointed out that she was not ending the stop-and-frisk practice, which is constitutional, but only reforming the way the NYPD is implementing controls.
From the Happiness of the Dreaming Camels
Happiness is an oasis that only dream camels can reach
With this Bedouin wisdom, the first president, Wolfgang Henne, described the history and fascination of the "Helping Hands" association.
On Saturday afternoon, the association celebrated its tenth birthday, which has already achieved considerable successes.
The first President Henne gave a detailed report on the work of the association.
He himself was first in Mauritania in 2004 at the Cheijk-Zajed Hospital in Nouakchott.
Further cooperation followed, and gynecologist Henne performed numerous surgeries on the ground on several trips.
During the talks, images of the operations were shown on a large screen, so that the guests of the anniversary event could get a picture of the actions mentioned.
The association's desert vehicle was also shown.
It's a former federal border guard vehicle.
Rainer Prewo, the former OB of Nagold, had proposed to equip this vehicle with a photovoltaic system and now plans to serve as an advisor to the association, Henne said.
In 2008, the Zimmerei Schleeh from Baiersbronn, in a record time of almost a week, set up the hospital in Socogim, a poor neighborhood on the outskirts of the capital - voluntarily.
Henne also mentioned a new mother-child hospital in Nouakchott
It is particularly interesting in times when Nagold's maternity clinic is being rationalised.
You learn a lot in Africa as a doctor, says Henne, about acceleration against burnout.
Because of the political unrest in the country, many trips were not possible, but many doctors came to Germany to host in different areas.
In addition, containers of materials are regularly sent to Africa, including medical devices, medicines, bandages, hospital beds and glasses in March this year.
Hans-Joachim Fuchtel, the co-initiator, provided a wealth of local color by telling about Mercedes vehicles converted from Mauritania to a mobile goat stable and the experiences of the indigenous musicians who traditionally support the club during their Mauritania trip.
He cited his work in the field of auditing as a young Member of Parliament as his personal motivation.
When he realized how much money was lost along the way, he decided to help the Africans in controlling a budget by the people.
Furthermore, Fuchtel stressed that the global economy also demands global human love.
It should also be remembered that Africa is closer than some people think.
It's not far from Gran Canaria to Africa.
Coulson used phone hacking to check a tip.
Former News of the Word editor Andy Coulson allegedly used "phone hacking, surveillance and confrontation" to try to confirm a false tip about an affair with then-Interior Secretary Charles Clarke.
Attorney Andrew Edis QC told the court at the Old Bailey that News of the World had heard a false rumor in May 2005 that Clarke was having an affair with his "attractive special counsel" Hannah Pawlby.
The paper commissioned private investigator Glenn Mulcaire to hack into Paulby's voicemails and stalked them, but Coulson also called them and left messages, as the court learned.
The prosecutor's office considers Coulson, who is now the editor of the Emergency, not to be standing outside people's homes hoping to catch them up to speed, but to be someone who likes to confront people with a story to see their reaction, Edis explained.
He said that NotW uses three methods to investigate stories: phone hacking, surveillance, and confrontation.
The publisher is personally involved in the third method.
Obviously, he knows about the second one, surveillance, otherwise it can't be.
How about the first one?
Does he know about the phone hacking?
He denies it, but we say, "And if he knew about it".
Rumors of a Clarkes affair were first picked up by the feature editor of NotW when a source who was sexually interested in Pawlby was told, "Don't waste your time, she's with Charles".
A tape of voice mail from her phone on at least three occasions was secured in Mulcaire's apartment in August 2006.
Investigators also found records on the detective's computer that Pawlby and her sister were stored as "projects".
During the time of the investigation, Pawlby's grandparents received anonymous calls asking for information about them, Edis explained.
Meanwhile, former chief reporter Neville Thurlbeck and former reporter James Weatherup were overseeing the surveillance of Pawlby's movements.
On June 18, 2005, Coulson left her a voicemail with the following content: "I have a story we want to publish tomorrow that I would like to talk to Charles about".
Edis explained that Coulson's activities in this story followed the same pattern as other important figures, such as former Home Secretary David Blunkett.
The jury heard Thursday that Coulson confronted Blunkett about an affair with a married woman when he was himself in a relationship with co-accused Rebekah Brooks, who was married at the time.
Coulson and Brooks deny conspiring with others to hack phones between October 3, 2000 and August 9, 2006.
Mulcaire, Thurlbeck and Weatherup admitted to hacking the phone.
In protest against the planned Reich tax, French football will actually go on strike for the first time since 1972.
A mediation meeting ends in vain.
In the conflict over the Reich tax, the government and professional football in France have been forced into a dead end after a failed mediation meeting.
President Hollande welcomed representatives of the trade unions and their complaints at the Élysée Palace in Paris on Thursday.
But he refused to spare football from the planned 75 percent tax on income of more than one million euros a year, which all companies in the country are to pay for two years from 2014.
The other side was tough, too.
The strike, which was announced for the end of November, will now be carried out, said Jean-Pierre Louvel, head of the Union of Professional Clubs (UCPF).
The dates for the Ligue 1 and Ligue 2 matches between 29 November and 2 December are therefore excluded.
The Commission has also adopted a number of proposals for a new directive.
"We want to involve the residents early in the planning process", Mayor Jens Häußler opened the public information event on the flood protection concept in Gechingen.
Around 80 participants came to the town hall to explain the planned measures, ask questions, express concerns and offer ideas.
Heuer made it clear: "The final decisions are made by the members of the local council".
The flood that hit Gechingen on 15 May 2009 was a major event that raised the question of protective measures for the future, Häußler said.
A river survey was commissioned with the neighbouring municipality of Aidlingen, which is now the basis for the flood protection concept in Gechingen.
"The aim is to protect as many built-up areas as possible", says Hausler.
The project is based on the planning of protection against floods that are expected every 100 years, according to the German Meteorological Service.
Climate change is covered by a 15% surcharge.
In specialised circles this is referred to as "HQ 100aKlima".
The water masses that caused considerable damage in Gechingen in 2009 were equivalent to a 1000-year-old flood.
"There is no absolute protection, but we can achieve a relative improvement", said Hausler.
To achieve protection of HQ 100aClima, around EUR 4 million must be invested in Gechingen, with the municipality expecting state subsidies of around 70%.
However, Mr Häusler pointed out that the aid would only be granted if a general concept was implemented.
The municipality is dependent on the participation of the citizens.
A complex planning and approval process has to be completed.
In the best case scenario, implementation could start in 2016.
The protection concept, which was presented to the local council last week (we reported) includes local measures to control the flow of the river Irm from the valley of Stammheim.
Following the presentation of the flood protection concept, the participants took the opportunity to raise their concerns.
Among other things, it was questioned why no more dams and reservoirs were planned to protect the site.
Gregor Kühn, specialist planner at the designated engineering office Wald and Corbe in Hügelsheim, who presented the concept, stressed that it required the interaction of all the measures presented to achieve the desired goal in total.
In addition, the most economical solution is to be found, says Joachim Wald von Wald and Corbe.
Anger prevailed among the people who were near the old town, who, even in normal thunderstorms, were constantly suffering from overloading the canal network.
The problem is well known to the administration and the first steps have already been taken.
However, Häußler pointed out that the directives on sewerage systems differ from those on flood protection and should not be mixed.
The municipality is required to interpret the canal network in such a way as to prevent two to three-yearly rainfall.
To scale up the sewers would swallow millions.
Serious injuries after collision
On the morning of Friday afternoon, two drivers were seriously injured in a head-on collision on State Road 44 near Revensdorf.
The police immediately closed the road completely, but at first they could not say much about the accident.
However, there are various testimonies that need to be evaluated.
The 19-year-old driver of a Volkswagen Golf was driving towards Revensdorf and the 38-year-old man from Gettorf met her in his Hyundai.
Both vehicles collided, with the woman so severely crammed that it took the fire department almost half an hour to free her from the vehicle wreckage.
The exact cause of the accident remained unclear at first.
Both of the injured were taken to nearby hospitals.
The track remained completely closed for about two hours.
You could call him the Dostoevsky of the United States.
Philip K. Dick was a godfather, a metaphysicist, and his novels and stories have something to do with serial.
The familiarity on the outside is astonishing: the stinging eyes, the beard, the high forehead.
And as Fyodor M. Dostoevsky, with his massive oeuvre as the discoverer and apologist of the Russian soul, is to be understood, Philip K. Dick is read as an American prophet, who is quite valid in his own country.
Some of the titles have been published by Heyne Publishing, which has a Haffman cassette with 118 stories selling two thousand pence.
Dick declares America - the realm of breathtaking technological progress, coupled with paranoia, security craziness and the belief of being chosen.
Dick had God experiences, and his later books read like a mix of the Revelation of John and a computer manual.
Maybe he was crazy, drugged his brain.
He realized early on that computers were divinities.
He wrote a theology of computers and asked what distinguishes a man from a machine, the creator from his creature.
That's the Blade Runner problem.
The killing.
A master of science fiction.
A fantastic writer.
His stories have inspired film directors like Ridley Scott, Paul Verhoeven and Steven Spielberg.
This story is particularly significant now.
The "Minimity Report" is from 1956, it's a breath of fresh air from the Cold War and the McCarthy Tribunals.
It's the principle of pre-crime that's being developed here, pre-crime, which is now more or less the official doctrine of the White House.
In Dick's world, which is terribly similar to ours, mutants look to the future and the police are coming.
"We are arresting individuals who have not violated any law", says the head of the agency.
"We'll catch them before they can commit a violent crime".
And, "There are no serious criminals in our society, so we have a penitentiary full of heavy-handed offenders".
They assume that bad things are happening, and they prevent the criminal thought from being put into action.
Dick's story is like the blueprint for the anti-terror laws and NSA wiretapping.
Anticipation of the attack: This is how Obama's drone philosophy and practice works.
But Dick's story is not over.
The chief of police complains that there is no longer a division of power, the military controls everyday life and what is left of the state.
Then the supervisor himself is monitored and taken to a future crime.
The system is going crazy.
It's perfect, but it's a lie.
It invents its own preconditions.
Not only does he buy mistakes and sacrifices, he builds on them.
The system creates the danger it fights.
Reading Philip K. Dick means getting closer to the truth.
Speculation about Merkel in Russia
Former US intelligence expert Edward Snowden could also make statements in his Russian asylum in the US secret affair with German Chancellor Angela Merkel.
German prosecutors could ask questions in writing or meet the 30-year-old in person in Russia, Interfax reported.
Earlier, the Green Party member of parliament, Hans-Christian Ströbele, was the first German politician to meet Snowden in Moscow yesterday to discuss the affair.
NSA revelations are fueling corporate paranoia about government surveillance
On a mild day in late August, a German police helicopter flew deep over the U.S. consulate in Frankfurt am Main, Germany's financial capital.
On the instructions of the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution and the Counter-Terrorism (BVT), the German Internal Security Service, he should photograph the roof of the US Post Office, located less than 5 km from the European Central Bank and the Bundesbank.
According to German media, the BVT wanted to prove the existence of surveillance signs and the action led to a word exchange between the US and the German Foreign Ministry in Berlin.
James Clapper, US Director of National Intelligence, insisted again in September that the US should not use foreign espionage to steal the business secrets of foreign companies on behalf of US companies so that they can expand their international competitiveness or profit.
But since Edward Snowden, a former whistleblower, began publishing his horn to U.S. surveillance secrets, European governments and corporate executives are unsure whether they can take the director's word.
Reports that the US National Security Agency spied on the Brazilian oil company Petrobas and obtained data from US cloud providers including Google and Yahoo have raised the company's paranoia about government surveillance to a new height.
The barrel of override brought the revelation that Chancellor Angela Merkel's phone had been wired, possibly for ten years.
If the most powerful person in Europe can be targeted, then business leaders are certainly potential targets.
Snowden has made the intense cooperation between U.S. intelligence and corporate intelligence transparent.
I think it's conceivable that these data could be used for mutual benefit.
Germany must wake up, says Oliver Grün, President of BITMi, which represents small and medium-sized IT companies in Germany.
German companies believe the US now poses almost as much risk as China in industrial espionage and data theft, according to a survey released in July by consultancy firm EY.
However, the documents leaked by Snowden have so far not shown any evidence that the US has passed on the operating secrets of foreign companies to its own companies.
Politicians have expressed concern that the EU lacks certain IT and Internet capabilities and should reduce its dependence on the US.
The companies are skeptical about this.
The Bundestag proposed that we should build a German Google.
I can only close my eyes and open them slowly ...
That's not how it works says Hasso Plattner, chairman of German software company SAP.
If you wanted a strong European IT industry, you shouldn't have let it die out 20 years ago.
Everything in Germany is subsidized, from coal to cars to agriculture.
Everything but the IT business.
Yet the reach and technical sophistication of the US intelligence agencies exposed by the Snowden revelations have shocked companies that had previously seen the greatest espionage risk in China.
The cloud computing industry is undergoing a major shift because European business leaders are now more aware that data stored in the US is subject to the jurisdiction there and therefore potentially at risk.
According to a survey conducted by the Cloud Security Alliance, a trade organization, after disclosures about U.S. data mining activities with Prism, about 10 percent of non-U.S. members rejected plans to use an American provider.
Jim Snabe, SAP's deputy managing director, says: We see a new question from customers that didn't exist a year ago  it is: Where are my data stored and can you guarantee that they will physically stay in this legal space?
Many German business leaders believe that recent reports simply confirm what they already knew, that powerful states want to steal their most precious secrets and that they must be guarded at all costs.
It's no surprise that there's business espionage.
It's always been that way.
It has been an issue for many years and has not changed fundamentally through the current discussion says Kurt Bock, Chairman of BASF Chemical.
The Americans are spying on us at the commercial and industrial level, just like we are, because it's in the national interest to defend our businesses.
The management of the company does not usually boast about the countermeasures taken, because this provides the attackers with advantages.
In large companies, employees have long been told that it is not advisable to take a free USB stick to a trade fair or to leave a laptop unattended in a hotel room, to put it mildly.
Ulrich Hackenberk, a member of the board of directors at carmaker Audi, says that it has been standard practice for years to collect the phones before a board meeting so they cannot be used as earphones.
The German BVT advises managers to use simple prepaid phones when travelling abroad, as smartphones may be compromised.
The prepaid phones are thrown away afterwards.
However, there is concern that small and medium-sized enterprises will remain vulnerable to hacking and surveillance.
In Germany, many of these companies are world leaders in their respective niche.
Small and mediumsized enterprises often lack the experience, staff and financial resources to effectively protect trade secrets from unauthorised access, warns the BVT in a report.
The United States warns its own companies of economic espionage by other countries.
According to the Washington Post, in February, the US National Intelligence Estimate ranked France, Russia and Israel second to China in the number of countries that used economic data for hacking.
A member of the board of a German blue chip company agreed that when it comes to business espionage, the French are the worst.
Bernard Squarcini, former head of the French interior intelligence service DCRL, was quoted in an interview this month as saying: The intelligence community knows very well that all countries, even when they work together to fight terrorism, spy on their allies.
Hechingen: Mass answers wedding questions
"Marriage is the most important journey of discovery a man can make", said philosopher Sören Kierkegaard.
Tips on how to at least make the wedding party work, now there was a special fair in the domain in Hechingen.
Representatives were important providers around a wedding.
One trend: the retro look has been reintroduced.
It starts with the wedding dresses.
White is must, best covered or in cream.
The clothes, often embroidered and embroidered, are closed in the front, often with a veil, while the backs are lowered and often end in a drawer.
But the spirits are divided, as Stefanie Koch of the fashion house ClothingMiller points out.
Men's suits are dominated by vest and plastron, but cream or brown combinations are also available.
The choice of the venue was declared important.
The rooms next door are not ideal, the ambience should be special.
This is where the domain brought its own offer to the attention of the public.
If you want to ride the carriage, your link has an offer.
"But cuddles are also popular for bachelor parties", he says.
Romantic is also sought after for invitation cards, flower arrangements, and even for wedding pictures.
"After-wedding photography" is becoming increasingly fashionable - so it's a series of recordings in special places, preferably waterfalls, a few days after the party, but in wedding dresses", explained Elisabeth Keidel.
Many more details of a successful wedding were presented in the domain on Sunday.
Flower arrangement, rings, wedding table, cake and even a magician like Marko Ripperger who can entertain guests in style.
Not to mention the proper cosmetics and nail care.
All for an unforgettable party.
Successful Dog Friends
For the first time, the athletes of Bitz's dog-friendly team were successful in a rally obedience tournament.
Achim Scherrenbacher started in Kandel with two dogs; with his dog Sandy, he scored 94 points in the beginner class and secured fifth place, and with the 15-month-old Marley, he brought it to twelfth place with 87 points.
Susi Höpp and her Woody in first grade faced the critical eye of the performance judge.
Parents of a Georgia teenager who died in a tragic accident believe murder
The parents of the teenager, whose body was found in a rolled-up ring mat in the gymnasium of his high school, are convinced that their son was murdered, the family's lawyer said Thursday.
Kendrick Johnson of Valdosta, Georgia, was found on January 11 in a raised mattress behind the grandstand in the cultural hall.
Lowndes County Sheriff's investigators concluded that Johnson died in a tragic accident, which the 17-year-old's family doubts.
"They are convinced that their son was murdered", Benjamin Crump, the lawyer for Kenneth and Jacquelyn Johnson, told FoxNews.com.
You never thought he died the way the sheriff concluded.
They believe that it is deprived of any logic, violates the laws of physics and human reason, says Crump.
Rather, they must be convinced that the truth is being concealed to protect the person or persons responsible for their son's death.
"Your son went to school to study and came back in a body bag", he comments.
U.S. Attorney Michael Moore said Thursday there will be a formal investigation into Johnson's death, as a number of important issues remain unresolved.
What was the cause of death?
Is his death a crime?
Moore said that at a press conference Thursday afternoon.
I follow the facts, no matter where they lead.
My goal is to find out the truth.
I believe there is a sufficient basis for a formal investigation, he said.
Moore told reporters that the initial autopsy indicated Johnson died as a result of a "position-related choking".
But a second autopsy revealed a different cause of death, Moore said.
There are a number of questions that need to be answered or confirmed, he said.
Moore added that if there was enough evidence to support a criminal or civil investigation into Johnson's death, he would instruct the FBI to conduct the investigation.
A representative of the County Sheriff's Office was not immediately prepared to comment on our request on Thursday.
A court in southern Georgia ordered Wednesday that authorities release all surveillance videos that investigators have reviewed.
The teenager's parents said they hoped the video recordings would contain clues to how he died.
CDC publishes allergy guidelines for schools
On Wednesday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) released a series of guidelines for dealing with food allergies in school children.
These are the first such guidelines issued by the US government as the number of school-age children with food allergies increases.
One in 20 children in the United States is now food allergic.
According to the CDC, the prevalence of food allergies among children increased 18 percent between 1997 and 2007.
The guidelines contain information for schools to raise awareness among teachers and staff about food allergies and how to deal with children who have allergic reactions.
It is also recommended that schools stock up on epinephrine  the car injection of EpiPen is most commonly used  to help combat a potentially fatal hypersensitivity reaction.
State legislators have recently changed the regulations to make it easier for schools to stockpile epinephrine.
The report also includes a list of typical symptoms reported in children who have an allergic reaction.
Kids might say, "It feels like something is pressing my tongue, my tongue feels like a hair is on it, or my tongue is creaking".
Parents of intersex children can choose gender indefinitely
Germany is the first European nation to recognize a third gender for children born with non-unique genitalia.
Newborns are no longer strictly assigned male or female.
Under the new law, parents no longer have to state the gender of such children, but can indicate either indefinitely or indefinitely on the birth certificate.
The aim of the law is to take the pressure from parents not to rush to make decisions regarding newborn sex reassignment operations and to combat discrimination against intersex people.
An intersex person said years later, according to the BBC, "I am neither man nor woman".
I'm still the work of a doctor's creation, mutilated and full of scars.
It is estimated that one in 2,000 children is born every year neither as a boy nor as a girl.
They are among the intersex, a group that is diagnosed with Sexual Difference Disorder (DSD), a collective term for people with atypical chromosomes, germ glands (ovaries or testicles) or unusually developed genitalia.
Wallis Simpson may have been intersex.
Gender identification is still not well understood, but most experts in the United States advise that you use the best available information to identify the gender if a determination is not possible, and not wait for the child's psychological and physical development before you decide  if at all  to undergo surgery.
New York psychiatrist Dr. Jack Drescher, who specializes in gender identification, said that the new German law "swears a good thing".
Intersex children are an ethical dilemma.
Some people have life-threatening conditions that require surgery, but this is not the case for most children, he said.
You can perform a sex assignment without surgery and then wait for the identity to develop.
The scientific data on how a child develops his or her gender identity in general is not very accurate.
No one knows why it's happening.
It's like the mystery of why people are gay.
A 2011 report to the European Commission states that intersex people should be distinguished from transgender or transgender people because their status is not gender-related but determined by their biological constitution, which is neither exclusively male nor female, but typically both at the same time or not clearly defined as one of them.
These characteristics were expressed in secondary sexual characteristics such as muscle mass, hair, breasts and stature, in primary sexual characteristics such as reproductive organs and genitals, or in chromosomal structures and hormones.
The report also provides an overview of the discrimination faced by intersex and transgender people in their professional lives and the extent of harassment, violence and prejudice.
Boys who don't match their gender have a special camp now.
In Australia and Nepal, it is now possible for adults to identify as male, female or third gender on official documents.
In June, Australian Norrie May-Welby (52) was recognised as the world's first non-gender person after a court granted lifetime maintenance of an undefined gender status.
German ID cards will have a third allocation next to M and W, X for intersex, according to the Interior Ministry.
In neighbouring France, gender issues are still controversial, according to a news report on France 24.
In 2011, dozens of French lawmakers from the strictly Catholic country signed a petition to remove the gender theory from school textbooks.
The American website Catholic Online has also spoken out against German law, arguing that if the world is dragged into a new state where sex is a choice but sexual activity is not, we will twist two more pillars of civilization.
The mother of a newborn from Maryland told Baby Zone she would prefer to have babies assigned a gender at birth.
Parenting is already stressful enough, even without further restrictions, especially if you don't know your child's gender, the parent website said.
Children need stability and security.
Historically, children born with both male and female genitals were called hermaphrodites, after the attractive Greek god who had both sexes.
Ten years ago, medicine considered sex to be something that could be erased and then rebuilt.
But now the ethical basis of surgery is being questioned, given the complexity of gender identity and the fact that doctors can be wrong because they don't know how a child feels growing up with the gender they're assigned.
"In the mid-20th century, they called it a 'psychiatric emergency,'" Drescher said.
When such a child was born, they did not call the psychiatrist, but the surgeon.
The prevailing theory about treating children with vague genitalia goes back to Dr. John Money of Johns Hopkins University, who believed that sex was shapable.
He defined the concept of gender identity and argued that social and environmental influences on how parents raise a child interacted with a child's genes and hormones and defined whether a person considered himself male or female.
However, in a case known as John/Joan in 1966, his theories became controversial.
He advised the parents of a boy whose penis had been cut off during a mistreated circumcision to castrate the child completely and also remove his testicles and then raise him as a girl.
Money presented this case as a successful example of a transformation, which he was not, according to Drescher.
When the boy was about 15, he switched back to the male sex and married a woman.
But at 38, he committed suicide.
According to Drescher, there are still doctors who would practice this model.
But in the 1990s, with the advent of the Internet, survivors of these sexual operations have come out to the public, who are not happy with the outcome.
So, Jim Bruce, a 36-year-old writer from Montana, who was born with XY male chromosomes, but ambiguous genitalia.
Doctors were not sure if he had a large clitoris or a small penis and were convinced that he could never lead a satisfying life as a man.
So his external organ and testicles were surgically removed shortly after birth in 1976, and he was raised as a girl.
At the age of 12, he was given female hormones.
"I knew I wasn't a girl", he told ABCNews.com.
I was unhappy, but it was really hard to ask questions.
At 18, he should get a vaginal implant.
But because he was depressed and knew something was wrong, he requested his medical records.
What he found was shocking.
I was sterilized at birth and no one ever told me that.
Bruce was born with a DSD that made his body unable to produce enough testosterone to develop his genitals.
After learning the truth, he switched back to a masculine identity, received testosterone injections, and had his breasts removed.
The operation made him infertile.
Today, he's fighting for others in an organization called Interface Project to see intersex people as normal.
But Anne Tamar-Mattis, managing director of the California-based legal group Advocates for Informed Choice, worries that German law could encourage stamping and stigmatisation.
Many activists are concerned that the German decision might encourage parents to make quick decisions and assign a 'non-defined' child, she explained.
We fear that this will favour intervention.
We think it's better to assign the male or female sex and then wait.
But we don't know what the law will do yet, so we can only speculate.
Tamar-Mattis said her organisation supports Australian law because it allows adults to be recognised as third-gender.
Adults should be able to make their own legal gender decisions, she explained.
The German law concerns the assignment at birth.
This is not a fight you should force on little children at this time.
When they grow up, they can decide for themselves about their bodies.
But Dr. Arlene Baratz, a Pittsburgh-based breast radiologist who has a daughter with a sexual dysfunction and supports hundreds of others in a self-help group, says German law "authorizes" both parents and children.
Katie, Baratz' daughter, was born with male chromosomes, but has a DSD called complete androgen resistance.
Because of the receptor defect in the target cells for testosterone, Katie developed female characteristics.
She has a vagina, but no uterus and no ovaries.
Katie is now 29 and married, working as a pediatric psychiatrist at the University of Pennsylvania.
Although barren, she hopes to have a child through adoption or a surrogate mother.
The law gives parents room to make decisions without hurry, Baratz said.
It gives them time to do various tests and clear things up and gives them time to write male or female.
That way, everything's fine. You raise the child and love it.
You have a wonderful baby and you enjoy the happiness of your parents.
And you don't have to rush into an operation that can't be reversed.
This involves the children in the decision making process and eliminates the fear that parents have of thinking they are not doing the right thing, she explained.
Eventually, the child decides which sex is best for him, and that's wonderful.
This will enable children to make their own decisions.
Unknown injuring girls by car fire
Unknown gunmen shot a 12-year-old girl in Saxony-Anhalt.
The perpetrators, in Ghent, allegedly fired an air-to-air rifle at a group of children on Thursday evening.
The police told me at Castle.
The girl was slightly injured in the left quadrant.
Rescue workers took the girl to the hospital.
The gunshot came from a small car that was passing a group of six children and had suddenly stopped.
Witnesses saw two people sitting in the car.
The perpetrators also shot at a bus stop.
A disc was broken.
Then they drove away.
The Criminal Police are investigating, it was Friday.
Until now, the police inspection can look back on a quiet Halloween night.
Officials were only called twice to throw eggs at children who threw them against house facades.
Since the owners were able to detect this in time and immediately remove the remains, no property damage was likely to have occurred.
In addition, some New Year's Eve bulldozers may have been set off in the city, but no property damage has been done here either.
A resident of Bishop-Freundorfer Road reported that his car was wrapped in paper and his board blinds were stolen.
But by the time the police arrived, the man had found his blinds in the immediate vicinity, so the police had to stop.
Living with a Future Looking
Actually, Waltraud Ries is living a great life.
Her house is in a quiet residential area of Stuttgart with lots of greenery, an old tree stock, nice neighbors and not too much traffic.
It's only a few minutes by public transport.
"I hope you're not afraid of spiders", asks Waltraud Ries, pointing to a fat spider on the door frame.
I've been looking for a new apartment for my husband and me for a while.
But you know how difficult it is in Stuttgart.
She explains, however, that the reason is not spider phobia, but the fear of being unable to cope with the many steps to the house and apartment in old age.
In addition, since undergoing meniscal surgery, the mid-50's has had to experience what it means to move from floor to floor with a handicap.
Recently, she published a book entitled 'Happily Living in Old Age - What Is the Best Way to Live?'
'Our apartment is the best example of what old age can't do,' she begins to tell us.
When she moved into the Maisonette apartment with her husband more than 20 years ago, it was just a beautiful apartment in the middle of the green.
Today, in her mid-50s, Waltraud Ries thinks differently.
But she also knows that she is one of the few people who are even dealing with the subject of 'old age housing'.
Most people will push it away as long as they can.
"It's just the other guys getting older", she says, giggling.
Only when the pressure of suffering is really great do you think.
'But then it may be too late,' says Ries.
In her book, the interior designer presents 17 models of self-determined old age housing.
'However, the choice of housing is always an individual's choice,' she explains.
There is no solution for age.
Even those who can afford to retire in Tuscany or Brittany should always consider that they too can get sick.
And: 'Without good knowledge of the local language, you can also get together in the Dolce Vita,' the specialist author suggests to those who want to emigrate.
Their models include classic care models, alternative forms of housing or the often cited pensioner's WG.
In old age, everyone has their ticks and ticks.
'To me, such a community would be nothing,' she says in a twinkle.
Not like a student gym with a shared bathroom and a kitchen.
'You just need your retirement rooms when you're old,' says Ries.
The bookmaker does not want to rule out the possibility that a senior living community can still function.
But it's going to have to be different than the classic student GG.
And sometimes you just want to be quiet, she thinks.
At least she's not alone in the capital.
'Most elderly people in Stuttgart want to stay in their own apartment as long as possible,' says Theresa Rütten, head of the Citizens' Service, Life in the Capital.
Your office advises people on the subject of 'aging'.
This is why older people in particular would often take up discomfort and limitations just to stay in their familiar environment, as the foundation Warentest has experienced.
Today, there are many ways to make your home or apartment accessible.
Ries recommends that all those who are involved in age-appropriate renovations of their home or apartment first take a thorough look and not hire the best craftsman.
Today, there are also age-appropriate rehabilitation specialists.
Even in the rented apartment, one or the other can be realized, and if it's just the toilet seat increase, the interior designer clears up.
But it is not always possible to make the existing apartment age-appropriate and thus barrier-free, even if it is still beautiful.
This was the experience that Waltraud Ries had to go through.
Although you could install a stair lift inside the apartment, which would also be paved with stairs to the door, it would be the far greater obstacle.
She'll keep searching until she finds the ideal object for herself and her husband.
She's grayer before the move than the spider at her door.
The United States wants to continue prosecuting Snowden
The United States has not changed its attitude towards former US intelligence officer Edward Snowden.
He will continue to be accused of giving out classified information unauthorized.
So he's going to have to face criminal prosecution in the United States, said State Department spokeswoman Jennifer Psaki in Washington.
Even the latest statements by Snowden would not change that.
Earlier, the German Green politician Hans-Christian Ströbele, after a meeting with Snowden in Moscow, had appealed to the United States not to threaten him with punishment any further.
Mr Psaki stressed that Ströbel's comments were those of a parliamentarian and not those of a German government member.
Intelligence whistleblower Edward Snowden is basically ready to talk to the German authorities.
But first, he wants to know his situation.
The former NSA employee wanted by the US made this clear in an unaddressed letter that the Green Party politician Hans-Christian Ströbele published on Friday after a meeting with Snowden and forwarded to the federal government, the Bundestag and the Attorney General.
The letter has the following text, according to a translation published by Ströbele:
To the competent authorities
I was asked to write to you about your investigation into mass surveillance.
My name is Edward Joseph Snowden and I used to work as a contractor and a technical expert for the National Security Agency, the Central Intelligence Agency and the Defense Intelligence Agency.
As I worked in these institutions, I witnessed systematic violations of laws by my government that led me to act out of moral obligation.
As a result of publishing these concerns, I was subjected to a serious and persistent urge to leave my family and home.
I am currently living in exile and enjoying temporary asylum granted to me by the Russian Federation under international law.
I am encouraged by the response to my political actions, both in the United States and elsewhere.
Citizens around the world and even high officials - including the United States - have judged the revelations about a system of comprehensive surveillance that is accountable to no one as a public service.
These espionage revelations prompted many proposals for new laws and policies aimed at the previously hidden abuse of public trust.
The benefits to society derived from these findings are becoming increasingly clear and the risks involved have been significantly reduced.
Although the outcome of my efforts has been proven positive, my government still treats dissent as a betrayal and seeks to criminalize and prosecute political expression.
Nevertheless, speaking the truth is not a crime.
I am confident that the United States Government, with the support of the international community, will adopt this agreement.
I hope that when the difficulties of this humanitarian situation are resolved, I will be able to participate adequately and lawfully in the responsible dissemination of the facts concerning the statements made in the media, in particular with regard to the truth and authenticity of the reports.
I look forward to speaking with you in your country once the situation is cleared up and thank you for your efforts to uphold the international law that protects us all.
Edward Snowden witnessed by Hans-Christian Strobel
Kindergarten found a private buyer
"The building is in good hands", says Mayor Michael Maier of Winterlingen.
The former kindergarten on Garden Street was sold by the municipality to a private individual.
The sale was approved by the local council at its most recent meeting in the non-public sector.
The building changed hands with its owner at a "reasonable" price.
"The community is satisfied", Maier stresses.
The budget was set at EUR 100 000.
It's not clear how the new owner wants to use the old kindergarten.
The mayor is right that Winterlingen has given the responsibility for the building to someone else before winter and thus no longer has to worry about the entertainment of the house, like heating, looking after the garden and clearing the sidewalk.
"This effort is gone now", rejoices Maier.
Concert in the summer
The Hammereisenbach Music Association is giving a concert on the terrace of the Hammer Inn.
When conductor Bianca Willmann picked up the clock at 7:30 p.m., the thermometer still showed 25 degrees.
About 50 listeners enjoy the sounds of the Hammerich musicians.
The chairman Manuela Honeck explains the music.
Honeck thanked all those who helped to successfully cope with the first musical shock.
Report: Obama campaign considered replacing Biden with Hillary Clinton
President Barack Obama's closest advisers have been secretly considering replacing Vice President Joe Biden in the 2012 election campaign with Hillary Clinton, according to the New York Times.
The revelation is the most remarkable surprise of Mark Halperin and John Heilemann's long-awaited work on the 2012 election campaign, Double Down: Game Change 2012.
The Times has a copy of the forthcoming book, and it reported Thursday evening that the president's top advisers had conducted extensive group meetings and polls in late 2011 to find out if Obama's waning hope of re-election would look better if he dropped Biden.
According to Jonathan Martin, national policy correspondent for the Times, the book thoroughly traces the history of the efforts of leading campaign and White House officials, notably former White House Chief of Staff Bill Daley, to measure the effect on polling ratings of ex-Secretary of State Clinton's trade for the Vice President.
The potential change was a closely guarded secret within the campaign infrastructure in Chicago and the Oval Office.
Only half a dozen of the president's closest advisers, including Daley, former Obama campaign manager Jim Messina, and former White House senior advisers David Axelrod and David Plouffe, knew about the proposed change.
In Double Down it is claimed that Daley was at the forefront of efforts to exchange Biden despite her close, personal relationship before finally deciding against such a move after the data showed that Clinton's candidacy would not significantly improve Obama's chances.
In an interview with Martin, Daley confirmed that the government had actually considered replacing Biden with Clinton.
"I made a whole bunch of comments to consider, and that was one of them", Daley told the magazine.
You have to remember that the president had terrible polling scores back then, so we thought, "For God's sake, what are we doing?"
While Daley called the investigations "careful", Martin told CNN's Anderson Cooper that considerable effort had been made during the re-election campaign to find out if such a move would pay off in terms of the ballots.
Campaign spending on surveys and focus groups is limited unless you think seriously about it, Martin explained on AC360.
It's unclear, however, whether Obama knew his team was thinking about a trade.
Martin told CNN he asked Daley if his then-boss knew about the potential change.
Although Daley stated that he did not believe the president was aware of the potential change, the former chief of staff admitted that it was possible that Obama knew about it.
Martin added that "double down" did not provide a definitive answer to the question of whether the political surveys had reached Obama's desk.
Cooper asked Martin if he really thought Obama knew nothing about the investigation into whether to drop Biden in the election.
"Maybe", Martin answered.
What happens on the way to my e-mail?
E-mail is actually called an electronic letter.
Was the design of the Internet service, like the conventional mail, technically using the letter secret?
The first thing that was important in the design of early Internet services was to make communication possible.
The basic technical protocols have therefore been neglected to provide a stable basis for a secure exchange of letters.
Therefore, a conventional email is more like an open postcard than a sealed letter.
If a user Anna sends an email to Benny, are the computers of the two connected directly?
The e-mail program or Anna's browser sends the mail to the mail server of her service provider.
For example, if she has a Gmail account, it would be Google.
This mail server sends the content to the provider Benni uses.
On the way, the mail can run on several other servers on the Internet.
Bennie can then call his content provider.
Do traditional emails get read on their way through the net?
Most emails are read multiple times by software robots on the go.
The sender's provider will usually check whether the mail carries a malware as an attachment.
The receiving systems are also subject to virus checks.
In addition, providers check whether it is a spam email that is annoying and unwanted and is immediately deleted or at least sorted into a spam folder.
Do the robots have another job?
In systems like Gmail, the robot also detects the information Google needs to place contextual ads.
If Anna and Benni communicate via Gmail about their upcoming vacation, Google can display links to their vacation offers.
Do strangers read the emails with you?
The likelihood of unauthorized persons reading an email is extremely low.
But theoretically, it is possible.
In companies, administrators often have the opportunity to read email.
Law enforcement and intelligence agencies also have legal means of intercepting or taking notice of emails.
This includes possible illegal surveillance activities.
Is it possible to protect e-mails from being read?
OpenPGP encryption can effectively encrypt an email against readers.
With high technical effort, it is also possible to hide the metadata of an email communication so that it is not even easy to identify who communicated with whom.
How important are Yahoo and Google in the German e-mail market?
The Commission also notes that the Commission has not yet established a specific methodology for the calculation of the costs of the public service contracts.
While Yahoo Mail's shares had recently fallen, Google's GMail was able to gain significantly.
Mother in the woods, and pension collected
When his aged mother died, a man from Wolfsburg forged a plan.
He buried the dead in a forest and continued to collect their pensions and maintenance.
To continue to collect pensions and child support, a 67-year-old Wolfsburger buried his dead mother in the woods, according to police investigations.
First he covered up the 89-year-old's death, then he cut the money for more than a year and a half.
Now the 67-year-old has to answer for fraud, as a spokesman said Friday.
The man hid the woman in a forest near Helmstedt.
The man was suspected in May when he noticed that the mother was no longer in need of medication.
The pensioner told investigators that his mother had traveled to Spain.
Because this occurred to the officials strangely, they continued to investigate.
It turned out that the two had been living together for over 15 years and he had been the last to look after them.
The 67-year-old finally admitted to his mother's death.
An autopsy showed no evidence of capital crime, police said.
You want ice cream that lights up in the dark?
A British entrepreneur has developed the first glazed ice in the dark using jellyfish.
Charlie Francis took advantage of the fluorescent properties of marine animals and made a sparkling treat out of them.
He came up with the idea after reading a paper on quills and convincing Chinese scientists to make the glowing protein artificially.
The ice cream reacts with the tongue when ingested, raising the pH of the protein and triggering the glow.
Chris explains that the ice cream reacts to the heat in the mouth and lights up, so the more you lick, the brighter it gets.
Charlie, founder of the ice cream company Lick Me I'm Delicious, says, The product is incredible, but still in a very early production phase, and you get two grams of it for 200 pounds.
The protein used in the ice cream reacts with the tongue at a neutral pH.
When the mouth warms up the protein, the pH rises and the ice glows.
We've been testing it for the last few months and it seemed ideal to launch it on Halloween because it has this wonderful lighting effect.
It's probably the most expensive ice cream I've ever made, because the quartz is four times more expensive than gold.
Every bullet costs me about 140 pounds.
But it tastes good for that.
Charlie's Bristol-based experimental company is famous for its unusual flavors, which include beer, cheese, beef and leafy gold.
But his latest creation is to become even more ambitious.
He says, "I'd like to develop an invisible ice cream".
This is impossible in itself because of the light breaking caused by the ice crystals that make up ice cream, but I suspect we'll find a way to make it work.
The ice cream uses the fluorescent properties of a quill artificially made by Chinese scientists
TSV Morsum is still without a point in the handball league after six days of play.
It's just now that Ingo Ehler's team is heading to the Derby tomorrow against TSV Daverden, who celebrated their first win last weekend.
This game is the start of a new season for us.
"I hope we finally have our heads free", Ehler's attitude is optimistic.
He finally has his entire team at his disposal, except for the permanently injured Hendrik Blohme.
Daverden, like us, is a game of time.
We must therefore keep our error rate low.
The Commission has therefore decided to take the necessary measures to ensure that the Community's financial resources are not used to finance the projects.
Daverden coach Thomas Panitz is much more relaxed after his first win of the season against Northhorn.
The game was a house number, of course.
But that's why we're not the favourite yet, because anything can happen in the Derby.
But Panitz wants to go to Morsum to start a series.
Jan-Malte will be missing from Jodat.
For this, the A-youth Joost Windussuss, who is active with double-player rights at the A-youth Bundesliga HC Bremen, is celebrating his season debut.
If you're not hot in a game like this, stay home.
Halloween 2013: In Numbers
When I was a kid, Halloween had something magical.
My sister and I were allowed to eat candy, stay up late, and dress up for the neighborhood.
I'm more like a Halloween muffin today.
For the past two years, I have not agreed to distribute candy from my apartment, and I don't think I will this year.
But statistics say I'm a black sheep when it comes to Halloween.
The majority of Americans,  158 million to be exact  celebrate Halloween this year, spending a total of $6.9 billion on candy, costumes, and decorations, according to the National Retail Federation of America (NRF).
One thing I look forward to every Halloween is the trend figures.
The costumes will be about 1.2 billion of the 6.9 billion dollars spent, according to the NRF.
This year, exciting inanimate objects are the final scream.
Women no longer have to cover themselves in sexy clothes, they can now also embody seductive food like pizza, hamburgers or carrots.
As for men, I expect a lot of zombies from The Walking Dead, and I bet the Daft Punk space men will make it to the Instagram feed this year.
According to Google, the most sought-after costumes are zombies, Batman, pirates and witches.
I guess there's nothing wrong with tradition.
We dressed our dogs last year and to my surprise, we weren't alone.
In fact, Americans are spending $330 million this year on their pets' costumes, according to the NRF.
That's a lot of hot dogs.
We're not too cranky about candy.
Americans are going to spend $1.9 billion this year on it, according to The Nielsen Company.
That's about 270 million pounds of chocolate bars, snacks, candy and rubber bears.
So good news for the 41 million people who are moving around the neighborhood with the saying "sweet or savory", according to the U.S. Department of Commerce.
In fact, we're going to buy over 40 million pounds of chocolate for Halloween and we're not going to worry about eating.
The only thing we don't want to consume is the sweet candy corn, yet 15 million pounds of it are sold on Halloween, according to the National Association of Candy Manufacturers.
That's about nine billion corn beans.
It's a riddle I haven't been able to solve yet.
Nothing is more Halloween than haunted houses.
They have great names like Terror Behind the Walls, Howl-O-Scream, and The House of Shock.
There are actually 1,200 officially recognized haunted houses in the United States that generate $500 million in revenue, according to America Haunts, and that includes the wonderful photos where you just pee in your pants and then put your friends on Facebook, where you never get rid of them, and then leave a comment like a "net" face to the guy you're standing on.
But we finally get to the pumpkins.
Charlie Brown introduced us to the Great Pumpkin when we were kids, and carving a pumpkin lantern is like decorating the Christmas tree -- something we've been doing since we were kids.
Fortunately, the "baby" in pumpkin trends didn't start until last year thanks to Pinterest, so most of us grew up carving the pumpkin instead of sitting in it.
This year, Americans will spend about $106 million on pumpkins, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.
The turmeric lantern, which is slowly rotting in the front yard, probably comes from Illinois, where this year 245 million pounds of turmeric were harvested.
If you want to score the right points, call Tim and Susan Mathisdon in Napa, California and carve something pretty out of their 921-pound pumpkin.
Home fire in Helmbrechts: rescue workers pick up coal-fired bodies
The fire department had to leave late Thursday night in Helmbrechts.
A three-family house in the county courthouse catches fire on Friday night.
Rescue workers are pulling a charred body from the house.
Rescue workers found a charred body in a three-family home in Helmbrecht after a fire.
It is unclear whether the person is a resident, a Bayreuth police spokesman said.
Late Thursday night, it had burned on the ground floor of the house.
When the fire department arrived, the flames were already burning out of a window.
The security forces went into the apartment and found the body in a room.
This room and another one burned out completely.
The whole ground floor was damaged.
All other residents were not home during the fire, the police spokesman continued.
The building is uninhabitable for the time being.
The exact cause of the fire was not clear at first.
Germany's largest state church has launched an offensive to promote the vocation of pastor.
The Evangelical Lutheran Church in Hanover expects its current pastoral numbers of about 1,800 to halve by 2030.
For today's young people, the profession is very attractive and offers good prospects for the future, said Pastor Mathis Burfien, 43, in an interview with the Evangelical Press Service.
It is attractive to be able to determine the work and day-to-day course of action.
With Burfien, the local church has commissioned a full-time pastor to encourage young people to study theology for the first time.
Today, fewer and fewer young people decide to study theology after graduation.
Burfien traces this to the process of excommunication: "God's voice is quiet, the world is loud".
The vocational training is characterised by great freedom and diversity.
I'm the master of my appointment calendar and I can put my focus where it matters to me.
Pastors could be very close to people as caregivers.
They earned as much as teachers, and they could make a living off it.
There is certainly more to be paid in the free economy, but for that, theologians would have a secure employer.
This is true of today's young people who are not just looking for a career, but for a meaningful job.
According to the state church, which covers three quarters of Lower Saxony, about 60 pastors retire annually.
At the same time, about 40 graduates of a theology program begin their vicarage.
In sparsely populated outlying areas such as the Harz, Emsland or Wendland, it may be difficult to fill posts in the future.
Burfien wants to organize a study day for young people, among other things, and to invite celebrities who have studied theology.
The theology program offers a broad education.
You can even become the president of the federal government.
Land Rover Rally Series announced
The interior has racing seats and six-point belts, as well as a free-speech system.
The options range from reinforced brakes, a service package with support from Bowler Works mechanics and logistical support to vehicle storage between events.
Drew Bowler, CEO of Bowler Motorsport, explains: "The rally customers who come to Bowler have changed.
They're not all experienced racers, but people looking for excitement and adventure and a way to get to world-class events.
We are delighted to be opening this path in partnership with Land Rover and MSA and believe that the format will open up new opportunities to experience the different rally disciplines in the UK and abroad and prepare newcomers for the difficulties and reality of Rally Raid.
We really enjoyed developing the Defender Challenge car. It's gonna be a fun championship.
In addition, the Defender Challenge will have a training and test day in February and the option to participate in desert races in North Africa and the Middle East.
Firefighters called to rescue a dog that was trapped 15 meters above the ground on a dangerous rock ledge in a quarry
Cockerspaniel dog Ruby ran away after a minor traffic accident.
Three days later she was discovered by a hiker in the quarry in her miserable position
Firefighters sailed to the rock walls and rescued the dog from certain death
The fire department managed to secure a puppy that was stuck in a rock wall on a 15 meter high ledge.
The nine-month-old Cocker Spaniel Ruby ran away from the scene of a traffic accident on Sunday afternoon and survived three days alone before being rescued from a quarry on Wednesday.
Scott Alderson, 25, and his girlfriend Becky Hall, 20, who owns the dog, came to the Flappit quarry in Denholme, West Yorkshire to welcome Ruby back and thank the West Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service.
They had been desperately searching for their missing dog and posting calls for help on social media when she escaped into the quarry after a small traffic accident.
At about 2:15 p.m. on Wednesday, a stray dog saw the stranded Ruby on the 15-foot-high porch in the quarry.
The technical rescue team at the Cleckheaton Fire Station rushed to the scene and set sail to rescue Ruby, who was then transported up in a dog box.
Andy Clayton, a specialist with the technical rescue team, said she was in a dangerous position.
It was in the middle of the rock wall, 15 meters above the ground.
She didn't move a muscle during her rescue. She was like frozen.
But she's fine now.
She then ate a couple of dog cakes.
That was a pretty unusual move.
The fact that the dog was discovered is incredible.
Peter Lau, a specialist in the technical rescue team, said: "Ruby had a huge accident".
There was a possibility that she was seriously injured or worse.
Ruby was taken to the vet for examination, but he found nothing but exhaustion and dehydration.
Becky Hall from Halifax, West Yorkshire, said: "Watching the rescue was scary.
I couldn't believe she was really up there.
It was wonderful to hold her back in my arms.
The vet explained that if the exhaustion had grown too great and it had collapsed, it would probably have collapsed.
The fire department did great things.
It was really brave what they did.
We're just so grateful, and each of them was absolutely incredible.
Scott Alderson of Keighley added: "We were afraid it would fall down, but it stayed upstairs".
The firefighters were great.
I can't believe where she was.
Mick Jagger explains he never married Katy Perry when she was 18.
In an interview with an Australian radio station this week, the pop star said she was a background singer on Jagger's 2004 song "Old Habits The Hard".
Perry explained that she had dinner with the nightgowner and that he had me on when I was 18.
She added: "It's been a long time and he's been very nice to me".
In a statement, a representative of Jagger, 70, said Thursday that he "categorically denies" that he ever attempted to approach Katy Perry.
The representative added: "Maybe she confused him with someone else".
Perry was one of the singers who made a guest appearance on the Rolling Stones tour this year.
Their new album, Prism, landed at No. 1 this week.
George Kerevan: European disengagement gives the Scots a choice
A new day, a new horror story about independence.
This time we are warned that an independent Scotland is needed to join the Schengen area as a condition of EU membership.
That provides the keyword for stories about passport controls in Berwick and a barbed wire border along Hadrian's Wall.
The Strathclyde template did indeed point out the possible economic benefits of greater freedom of movement in the rest of Europe, but it was not what was expected to be in the headlines.
Nor did anyone mention that EU Member States often bend their strict rules when it is more favourable to them.
As Scotland is not currently part of the Schengen area, continued disregard for Brussels would be only a small concession in return for what is really wanted from the Scots.
So, not really a story.
And one that's been around for years, that's like a fossil: I first heard the term "independence means passport control" at least 40 years ago.
An interesting point is lost in the constant repetition of this ancient story.
Why should we expect an independent Scotland to dance to the European pipe?
Why trade the yoke of London for that of Brussels, especially now?
This is the real European news: the great postwar plan to unite Europe has been stalled.
The Euro crisis officially ended the Europe project.
All over the EU, parties that are hostile to the EU or want to overthrow the euro as the Community currency are gaining ground.
Even in Germany, the Eurosceptic Alternative for Germany party, founded this year, was able to garner almost five million votes in the September Bundestag elections, effectively expelling the Free Democrats (the equivalent of the British Liberal Democrats) from the Bundestag.
There has always been domestic resistance to the plan to create a federalist Europe.
The current economic crisis, however, is a turning point.
The strict austerity policies imposed by Berlin and the European Central Bank, coupled with the forced jacket in which the national economy is forced by the common currency, have led many to believe that the Europe project has gone too far.
The euro crisis has little to do with national governments causing excessive budget deficits  this was only the case in Greece.
Instead, the Eurosystem has pegged its members to exchange rates that are advantageous to German exporters  and German politicians would like to leave that to them.
Without the possibility of devaluing the local currency, southern Europe is in a built-in productivity disadvantage over Germany.
The only way is to cut wages and public spending  encouraged by Berlin.
The current budgetary and monetary problems are caused by a deeper European productivity problem.
The Green Energy Directives, which were promulgated by Brussels, provide a code for subsidizing French and German energy companies at the expense of consumers. European industry pays twice as much for electricity and four times as much for gas as it does for the United States.
This is a crippling cost disadvantage, as we have already seen in Grangemouth.
All the wage rates in the world do not protect the European petrochemical industry from being pushed into the corner by cheap American shale gas.
The result is a revolt, especially in France, the former EU cheerleader.
After the war, France's political elite saw the EU as a vehicle to keep Germany in check and to level Paris with Washington.
But Berlin no longer needs Paris as a gateway to political legitimacy and Europe has imposed its own economic policy, which is what the fractured French economy is struggling with.
The result: Marine Le Pen, the right-wing, anti-EU Front National, has just won a decisive re-election, putting the ruling Socialists in third place.
The Front National is now the most popular party in France with 24 percent of the vote  a timely warning to the British Labour Party that it cannot assume that a split in the right-wing spectrum would automatically mean advantages for the left.
What is Le Pen doing with her newfound popularity among the white French working class?
It wants to use the EU elections next year to forge an anti-EU, anti-Community currency bloc in the European Parliament.
If the anti-EU parties do well in these elections  and this is very possible  then for the first time such a bloc could dominate the European Parliament.
This is the point I want to draw: in the not too distant future, the growing resentment against the EU and the common currency will coalesce to abolish the euro.
The EU will not disappear, but rather become something like the Europe of (sovereign) nations that General de Gaulle favored.
Germany and some of its satellite companies may hold onto the euro, but France and southern Europe will return to their own currencies.
I expect the UK to distance itself from this project in the hope of flattering itself with the US.
However, Washington's growing interest in the Pacific suggests that Britain will stand alone in the Atlantic rain.
Where does Scotland stand with all this?
We can decide to be a region of (in the final analysis) Little England.
Or we can defend our own economic interests, which includes saying to Berlin and Brussels what they can do.
I suspect that Scotland could do quite well in a looser European union if we kept our own currency.
Cooperation with other like-minded countries is easier in an unfederated Europe of nations.
Otherwise we should consider equating Norway with the rest of the world and maintaining our economic independence.
The SNP government in Scotland is notable for being the most successful political movement against austerity in Europe, gaining a spectacular majority in 2011 due to its rejection of the proposed (and implemented) cuts that were to be held accountable to Labour Finance Minister Alistair Darling and the subsequent Tory-Lib Dem coalition.
It would be ridiculous for Scotland to decide independence now, only to be forced by Berlin and Brussels to implement a policy of austerity.
Early puberty: Growing up faster
African-American and Hispanic girls tend to reach puberty more quickly than their white counterparts, research shows.
Physical changes do not directly translate into puberty
There's no evidence that hormones or other chemicals are responsible
Experts believe that epidemic obesity is a trigger for early puberty
The trend towards early puberty is less pronounced in boys
Former CNN correspondent Pat Etheridge is a journalist specializing in child health and family issues.
Should a mother be concerned when her daughter grows breasts and hair at seven or eight years of age?
At the annual conference of the American Academy of Pediatrics this week in Orlando, Florida, pediatric endocrinologist Dr. Paul Kaplowitz stated that these early physical changes are relatively normal among American girls and represent a new norm.
"I spend a lot of time reassuring parents, which is usually not a sign that puberty is fast approaching", Kaplowitz explained.
Obvious signs of development, such as growing breasts, hair on the arm and arm, and body odor, are more likely to be seen in girls.
However, there has been only a slight shift in menarche age (the onset of first menstrual bleeding) in the last 40 years.
In the United States, the average age is 12.5 years, slightly below 12.75 in 1970.
When breasts start to develop, it takes at least two to three years to menopause, said Kaplowitz, also author of the book Early Puberty in Girls: The Essential Guide to Dealing with This Common Problem.
Time is the most accurate test of how puberty progresses.
It is controversial what actually represents the beginning of puberty, but it is true early maturity if breast enlargement is accompanied by a growth spurt before the age of eight.
In most cases, the process slows down or stagnates  something that a pediatrician can monitor closely.
If progress is faster, tests may be performed by an endochronologist to rule out serious problems such as tumors or cysts.
There are treatments to delay early menstruation and prevent another consequence: premature bone ageing, which can ultimately lead to growth inhibition and thus small body growth in adults.
Recommendations for medication or hormone therapy are based on the child's age, developmental rate, growth rate and emotional maturity.
Psychosocial aspects are also important.
Kaplowitz is reserved about medication, but he admits: The suppression of puberty can alleviate behavioural problems and the feelings of girls to be different from their peers.
The other big problem is understandable: Parents just don't want their very young daughters to have their period.
"They are worried about the risk of pregnancy or how they handle the hygiene side", said Kaplowitz.
It was a shock, remembers a woman whose daughter had her days at ten.
Even though there were early signs and we talked about menstruation, she wasn't emotionally prepared.
She came home scared and excited from school because she was the first in her circle of friends.
There are many widely published theories about the causes of early puberty.
But there is no conclusive evidence that hormones in milk or other foods, chemicals in the environment, or sexual messages in the media are causative.
Boys are as early as girls into puberty.
Kaplowitz believes that the most convincing premise is the obesity epidemic.
He supported a 2001 study of girls aged six to nine that linked body fat to puberty.
Other studies support this conclusion, but there are many other factors that played a role.
In this country, African-American and Hispanic girls tend to reach puberty more often than their white counterparts.
There are different explanations.
Globally, early puberty seems to be affected by everything from economic conditions to climate to genes.
Another mystery: Although boys develop facial and facial hair earlier, the trend toward full-blown early puberty is not as pronounced as in girls.
Other doctors at the AAP conference emphasize the complexity of the subject.
Acne and pubic hair are common even in infants and young children.
"We need to be careful about identifying the true start of puberty", said Dr. Lawrence Silverman, a pediatric endocrinologist at Goryeb Children's Hospital in Morristown, New Jersey.
Parents should not hesitate to ask their pediatrician for advice on how to talk to their child.
This may mean having to have a conversation earlier than expected, advised Kaplowitz.
When you stay calm, the child usually responds well.
Girls who blossom early need the assurance that the process is a normal part of life, even if it occurs sooner than expected.
Jumbo manufacturers are fighting over seat width in the face of large orders
A dispute has arisen between leading aircraft manufacturers over the width of tourist seats on long-haul flights, setting the tone for a bitter crash at the Dubai Airshow this month.
The dispute is about the seating capacity that long-haul passengers in the tourist class are offered  not always the ones that airlines are most eager to get, but this designated space is key to the efficiency claims made by Airbus SAS and Boeing Co.'s latest aircraft.
Airbus demanded an industry standard this week that requires a seat width of at least 46 cm (18 inches) in the tourist class, but the US rival Boeing says that should be the airlines' choice.
The debate comes at a time when aircraft manufacturers are competing to sell even larger versions of their twin-engine long-range aircraft and are expecting record orders at the event from 17 to 21 November.
The design of the rear of the aircraft  in particular whether there are rows of nine or ten seats  is crucial for the economic results indicated, which the new Mini-Jumbo design is intended to deliver.
Boeing claims that its upgraded 777X catches 406 passengers in the tourist class seats that are over 17 inches wide, allowing 10 per row.
Airbus explains that the competing version of the A350 carries 350 passengers in 18 inch wide tourist-class seats, with nine per row.
Airline giants often give leverage on technical details through advertising in the press.
Now Airbus is appealing directly to the public ahead of the Dubai Airshow, where the 777X is expected to race with over 100 orders.
Recently, the company presented an ad that could be the start of a new ad war, showing donors a picture of three people squatting together in a restaurant, and the title: Would you accept this?
Boeing is proposing long-haul seating flights that are narrower than regional turbo props, says Airbus Sales Manager John Leahy.
Changes in dietary habits have made people fatter, but plane seats have not changed radically.
Between the early 1970s, when the Boeing 747 defined modern long-distance travel, and the end of the century, the weight of the average American male between the ages of 40 and 49 increased by 10 percent, according to U.S. Department of Health and Human Services data.
The waist circumference of the average American male in the 21st century is 100.8 cm, according to U.S. health statistics.
Airbus says its rival is sticking to a 1950s seat concept, when the average body size of the newly-baptized jet set was smaller.
According to Airbus, studies have shown that an additional inch per seat increases sleep quality by 53 percent.
The Commission also notes that the airline's decision to grant the airport services licence to airlines is not in line with the airline's decision to grant the airport services licence.
The company also states that according to the investigation, the experience in the aircraft depends on more than the width of the seat.
It really is about giving airlines flexibility to do what they think they need to do to be successful, explains Boeing flight cabin expert Kent Craver.
They don't want us dictating what makes them profitable.
You know your business better than anyone.
The question is whether passengers should be allowed to do more, but it is increasingly becoming a problem for manufacturers that can affect sales.
The debate is about a race for aircraft orders with an estimated volume of at least US$700 billion in list prices over the coming decades, which could have a lasting impact on the export balance sheet of the US or Europe.
As Reuters first reported in July, the seating layout is the driving force behind the debate over the new jets.
Both Airbus and Boeing claim 20% more efficiency per seat in their latest long-range twin-engine designs than the market leader in this segment, the 365-seat Boeing 77-300ER.
Boeing's statements on the results are partly based on the fact that the 777X, with its ten seats per row, is compared to the original design of nine seats in the 777.
The increased costs per unit are still lower than those for currently used machines with 10 seats per row.
Boeing is therefore clutching more seats on its aircraft to make it more competitive with our products says Kevin Keniston, Head of Passenger Comfort at Airbus Europe.
On the other hand, analysts say that full cabins with ten seats per row on existing 777s suggested that many passengers were opting for the tighter arrangement, which could be accompanied by cheaper fare.
Eighteen inches of seat width would be great for passengers, but the reality is that from an economic standpoint, Airbus's offer is driven by the 777 threat says Mary Kirby, cabin fittings expert, founder and editor of Runway Girl Network.
Airbus and Boeing do not offer seats but a catalogue of suppliers from which airlines can choose.
The world-wide jet vendors even carry bandwidth to match the equipment to the competition.
Even if they praise comfort, all manufacturers also offer high-compression jets for low-cost and regional flights.
Airbus offers a ten-seat A350 but has not yet sold one, according to its own statement.
Until recently, Airbus had stressed the importance of more adaptability of cabins and offered wide seats on the sidewalks for some jets.
Without the support of the only other major modern jet manufacturer, experts say the reputation for a new industry standard is likely to be disrupted, but could distract from the wave of 777X sales.
New nicotine vaccine could make smoking fun a waste
Scientists have developed an anti-nicotine vaccine that could spoil the fun of smoking.
A single dose of the vaccine could protect mice from nicotine addiction for a lifetime.
Before human tests, further trials are needed, which may take several years, but Professor Ronald Crystal of Weill Cornell Medical College in New York said the initial results were good.
We are very hopeful that this type of vaccination strategy will one day help millions of smokers who have tried to quit, and tried all the methods available on the market, but have had to experience that their nicotine addiction is stronger than these approaches, says Cornell.
The new vaccine contains a harmless virus that has been modified to contain the genetic information for the production of nicotine antibodies.
The virus selectively infects the liver cells, which then produce a constant stream of antibodies.
The antibodies chase the nicotine molecules in the blood and neutralize them before they reach the brain, making a smoker not experience nicotine levels.
In trials, vaccinated mice given nicotine maintained their normal activity levels.
On the other hand, mice without vaccination had taken a "break" - a sign that the nicotine had reached their brains, the researchers explained.
The experiments are described in the journal Science Translational Medicine.
Previous tobacco vaccines failed because they contained antibodies.
The vaccines had to be given so often to maintain antibody levels that they were expensive and impractical.
But the cost of the new vaccine is likely to be significantly lower, because it turns liver cells into antibody factories.
As Professor Crystal said, a future vaccine for humans, if it is safe, could be given to children before they are tempted to try a cigarette, thus preventing nicotine addiction.
But it's more likely that smokers would use it to quit.
They know that when they start smoking again, they no longer feel pleasure because of the nicotine vaccine, and that helps them to quit the habit, he explains.
British scientists said the results were interesting but warned that further research was needed.
Tripodi denies being influenced by Obeid
Former Labor Party Secretary Joe Tripodi of New South Wales is being investigated by the state corruption watchdog.
The former NSW minister denies having changed the maritime lease rules at the request of his political mentor Eddie Obeid, who had hidden holdings in three parcels of land on state-controlled land.
The Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) on Friday expanded its investigation into whether Obeid influenced several ministers to extend leases on Circular Quay, where the Obeids operated two restaurants and a café, without a tender after their expiry in August 2005.
Now, the allegation is that Tripodi knew of Obeid's hidden interest in the property after Tripodi's former deputy chief of staff, Lynne Ashpole, testified on Thursday.
In years of talks, which began in 2005, the government had pressed for public tenders for leases.
The tenants were against it and wanted longer periods of service.
In 2009, leases for companies on Circular Quay, which generated $2.5 million a year for Obeids, were extended without a public tender.
Tripodi, who was Minister of Ports from February 2006 to November 2009, initially supported public tenders.
However, he denied having made the changes at the request of Obeid, who, as Tripodi confirmed, had pushed for a change in the government's rental arrangements.
One of the telephone transcripts submitted to ICAC showed conversations between Obeid, Tripodi and Steve Dunn, a senior official who had moved to the Ministry of Ports after working under Obeid in the Fisheries Authority, in August and September 2007.
Was the subject discussed in these telephone conversations the development of commercial leasing arrangements?, asked Deputy Commissioner Anthony Whealy Tripodi.
"No", Tripodi answered.
I can't remember what was discussed, but it definitely wasn't.
Definitely not between me and Mr Obeid.
Israeli fighter jets strike target in Syria, official sources say
Israeli fighter jets attacked a target in the Syrian port of Latakia on Thursday night, a senior government official told Fox News.
The official did not explain what the target was, but said there was at least one.
According to the Associated Press, the target was Russian SA-125 missiles.
At least twice this year, Israel has already carried out air strikes on missile deliveries to Syria.
Foreign workers with 457 visas could be subjected to an authenticity test
The government is considering an authenticity test for foreign workers with 457 visas as part of an extended measure.
If the test were to be introduced, it would be based on a criterion to prevent the 457 from being used to occupy unqualified jobs or as a backdoor for transporting family and friends to Australia.
A government proposal for a debate was published today after former Labor Party MP Maxine McKew condemned the government's comments on foreign workers, which could be seen as insulting by Australia's neighbours.
Sexual statements such as 'foreigners should be in the back' and 'Australians should be in the first place' are a very unpleasant setback to times when unions demanded a protected labour market', she told the Australia India Institute today.
Historically, this meant protecting white workers, and if some in the region were to belittle an echo of this historic artifact, I wouldn't be surprised.
The discussion proposal outlines 12 measures once devised by former immigration minister Chris Bowen.
Mr Brendan O'Connor, Minister for Immigration, who spoke yesterday about human trafficking in Sri Lanka, has implemented five of the proposed amendments, the others are still being considered.
If the authenticity criterion is adopted, a person applying for a visa could be checked for authenticity of the application in cases where the applicant is related or personally linked to the holder or relevant person of the supporting undertaking.
Companies could also be required to report on the number of 457 visa holders after companies that initially wanted to support only a small number of workers in the past eventually hired hundreds.
Meanwhile, a 35-year-old Sri Lankan asylum seeker died of a heart attack after arriving on Christmas Island on a refugee boat this week.
The disordered nine-year-old son of the man who had come to Australia with him has been cared for since his father died Wednesday by an adult cousin who was also on the boat.
Australian authorities took the man to Christmas Island Hospital, where he died.
The UK Government has announced a study to increase the benefits of the HS2 railway project for Scotland.
The work of HS2 Ltd suggests that high-speed connections between Scotland and the north of England should be made available as early as the start of Phase 1 in 2026.
Transport Minister Baroness Kramer said the project would bring Britain closer together.
Scottish Transport Minister Keith Brown said he was very pleased to work with the UK government on this plan.
Phase 1 consists of a new high-speed rail link between London and the West Midlands.
After Phase 2 is complete, there will be connections to Manchester and Leeds.
In June, the government corrected the estimated cost of building the high-speed railway between London and the north of England from £32.7 billion to £42.6 billion.
The UK Government, which is in talks with Transport Scotland, has commissioned HS2 Ltd to look for further capacity improvements and travel time improvements for Northern England and Scotland.
This includes the possibility of travel time of three hours or less from Glasgow and Edinburgh to London.
Baroness Kramer said: "Our aim for HS2 is a truly national road network that brings the UK and its cities closer together".
We're moving forward with HS2 because it brings enormous benefits.
Without it, we're facing a capacity crisis in our rail network.
But it also concerns the connection between 18 British cities, including Glasgow and Edinburgh, which is improved thanks to HS2.
The Scottish Secretary of State, Alistair Carmichael, commented: "Today's announcement is good news for Scotland.
On behalf of the Scottish Government, Keith Brown called on Carmichael to make an unmistakable commitment to the inclusion of Scotland in the HS2 network.
Brown said: 'The high-speed rail link has the potential to provide enormous economic benefits for Scotland, but at the same time it provides an argument for high-speed rail links across the UK.
We are therefore pleased to work as partners with the UK Government to explore the options for a high-speed rail link in Scotland that will benefit all and complement the Glasgow-Edinburgh link already planned by the Scottish Government.
I look forward to reviewing the report with the British ministers next year and to deciding together on the next steps.
Rules on electronic devices in aircraft remain in force in Australia for a period of time
Australian air passengers will still have to turn off tablets and smartphones at takeoff and landing, despite efforts in the US to relax regulations for such devices.
The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) allows US airlines to change their specifications so that passengers can read, watch or play e-books on their devices during critical flight phases, provided they are in flight mode.
Passengers are already allowed to do so during most of the flight, but many people find it annoying that they are not allowed to read their e-books when they take off and land.
Australian companies are monitoring the decision to implement which requires US airlines to do a lot of work, but they do not have any immediate plans to change their rules.
The CASA also stated that it would review the announcement but stressed that restrictions on the use of electronic devices in critical flight phases remain in force in Australia.
CASA has no specific regulations for the use of electronic devices in aircraft, it was announced.
The issue is subject to provisions that require airlines to maintain safety at all times and passengers to follow safety instructions given by cabin crew.
Virgin has already been in discussions with CASA about expanding its Wi-Fi maintenance system on flights and has stated that it is open to changes but that they should be initiated by the legislature.
We would welcome a review of the CASA's approval of electronic devices, because we are convinced that this would improve the customer experience after we now offer (wireless entertainment) during the flight, a spokesperson said.
Qantas said it would remain in the current regulations until further notice.
Our current guidelines provide that electronic devices are not to be used at launch and landing, and we have no plans to change this at the moment, the company explained.
The FAA rules apply to US airlines.
However, we are always interested in developments in regulations that passengers can benefit from, and we will certainly take a closer look at the FAA decision and the reasons behind it.
The decision will have a different impact on American companies depending on the age of the fleet.
They must demonstrate that their aircraft can tolerate radio interference from mobile devices and change manuals, training materials, hand luggage programmes and customer instruction.
After confirming the tolerance of its fleet, an airline can allow passengers to use portable, lightweight electronic devices such as tablets, e-book readers and smartphones at any height, the FAA announced.
In rare cases, when there is poor vision, the crew will instruct passengers to turn off equipment during landing.
The group also recommended that heavier equipment be safely stored under the seat or in the compartments above the seats when taking off and landing.
Before the Revierderby against Schalke, BVB supporters who had travelled with them had been using light tracks to provide ugly scenes in the Veltins Arena.
Borussia Dortmund has announced severe consequences.
Before Friday's Bundesliga game against VfB Stuttgart, the Ultras reacted with silence - at first.
It was an unusual, almost ghostly acoustic that was offered to the viewer until shortly before the start of the Bundesliga match between German vice champion Borussia Dortmund and VfB Stuttgart at Signal Iduna Park.
The main audience was the guest fans with their singing.
The South Stand, where the loyal and loudest BVB fans stand, was at first unusually quiet: no songs, no carnage.
The pod of the Capo, which normally coordinates the joint fire, remained unoccupied.
And right in front of the stands, a large flag with the words "Section Stadium Ban" was blowing.
Only when goalkeeper Roman Weidenfeller, as always, became the first BVB player to enter the field, brief cheers burned up.
When his teammates followed, there was loud singing and a bloating scarf - but not everywhere.
There was no movement in the central blocks 12 and 13 of the south stand.
Norbert Dickel, the stadium's spokesman, once again listed the positive experiences of the last few days - derby victory, Arsenal victory, contract extension by coach Jürgen Klopp - did not bring about a celebration.
Only five minutes before the whistle, the capo climbed his podium - and the tension that had been felt with his hands until then was released in a loud cry as Dickel, as usual, questioned the mood on the ranks in the stadium.
Last, as always, was the southern stage, and finally, as usual, the loudest place in the stadium was here again.
And not later than the loud call from the South Tribune "Derby victor stands up" came in, everything was back to normal.
The silence before was probably a reaction to the events of the past few days.
Just before Revierderby at FC Schalke 04 some of the BVB supporters had fired light traction into the audience and onto the square - almost hitting goalkeeper Roman Weidenfeller.
The game was delayed because of the chaotic scenes.
BVB boss Hans-Joachim Watzke had received the top of the Dortmund Ultras in his office afterwards - and if you believe Watzke's words, this was a rather uncomfortable appointment for the fans.
"There will be massive cuts to the entire ultra movement", the BVB boss announced on Thursday evening at a panel discussion in Frankfurt.
As an immediate measure, Watzke banned the Ultras from choreographing the home game against VfB Stuttgart.
"I forbid that", he explained.
We cannot give up the zero-tolerance policy on pyrotechnics.
In addition, the Ultras were shown various possibilities for punishment - until Tuesday they now have time to decide on one.
Otherwise, Watzke said, the BVB will impose a sanction by the end of next week.
"This is going to be a big one", Watzke assured.
You can be curious about how the South Stand will react.
Pending houses booming in Singapore as the middle-class crisis hits
Janani Amirthalinga, in a pawn shop in the Bendemeer shopping centre in Singapore, exchanges a gold bracelet, a ring and a pair of earrings to pay her daughters' school fees.
"My husband and I just bought a house, and all my money is in it", says Amirthalinga.
Although she earns 3,000 Singapore dollars (about 1,730 euros) a month as an administrative worker and her husband works, the family's monthly income is not enough, she explains.
In fact, demand in parts of Southeast Asia  where household debt is increasing  is so high that ValueMax, where it has made its exchange, became the third mortgage house to be listed on the Singapore Stock Exchange this week.
Not only is the mortgage of jewelry a quick way to get money  1,300 Singapore dollars in the case of Janani Amirthalinga , but it's almost as cheap as an unsecured bank loan.
Typically, mortgage lenders in Singapore charge an effective annual interest rate of 17 percent, which is just over the 15.4 percent required by the United Overseas Bank, from a local lender with a branch in the same shopping center.
However, mortgages have the advantage that creditworthiness checks or proof of income are not required, which makes loans faster than banks.
This is why millions of people in the region are turning to pawnshops as families face the pressure of rising living costs and rising household and consumer debt.
After five years of robust growth since the global financial crisis and cheap loans due to loose financial policies in developed economies, low- and middle-income families are looking for pawnshops to make up for the gap in a sluggish economy.
This week, the rating agency Standard & Poor's identified rising household debt, mainly due to rising mortgages, as a risk factor for the creditworthiness of Asian banks.
Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore are estimated by the Agency to have the highest household debt in Asia in terms of GDP.
Malaysia is at the top of the list with 80 percent of GDP, up from 60 percent in 2008.
Economists are also concerned about the high consumer debt in Thailand, which has barely emerged from a technical recession this week.
On Thursday, the data showed a continuing weakness in exports and a slowdown in consumer demand.
In the end, this means that in the face of rising costs, people in the middle to lower income segment will try to supplement their income wherever possible says Song Seng Wun, economist at CIMB, a Malaysian bank.
Historical highs in gold prices over the past two years have further intensified the trend of confiscation of personal property as people take advantage of the opportunity to turn family jewelry into cash.
In Singapore, about 70 percent of the pledged items in the city-state's 200 pawnshops are gold.
People say, "The gold price looks good, let's pawn Grandma's gold chain and get it back next month".
The largest Thai pawnshop operator, EasyMoney, has seen a 20 percent increase in customers in its branches in recent months.
The growth in the mortgage business is so strong that ValueMax, which operates its branch in Bend Sea and 15 others in Singapore, wants to expand not only to neighbouring Malaysia, where the company operates four houses, but also outside Asia, according to Yeah Lee Ching, CEO of ValueMax.
The company is financing this with 60 percent of the 66 million Singapore dollars it raised this week with the IPO in Singapore.
While some lenders have been caught in the crossfire over high interest rates, Yeah explains that mortgages not only pay lower interest rates than other lenders, but also do not directly increase debt.
Customers borrow items they already own and the liquidity of personal valuables does not increase budgetary training, she explains.
The mortgage business is increasingly accepted as a short-term, secured financing by society.
Also, not all people who use mortgages are in financial trouble.
Rich people from Singapore also come to ValueMax's stores to pawn gold bars and Rolex watches, for which they get up to 60 percent of the purchase price in cash.
We have customers from all walks of life.
This includes wealthy people who borrow something for a business or investment in the short term, or small businesses who need to bridge cash flow bottlenecks, says Yeah.
Sometimes they just need money very quickly.
NSA sucks data from Google and Yahoo - Snowden wants to help
Intelligence revealer Edward Snowden has a principled interest in helping Germany solve the ever-growing NSA spy scandal.
According to Hans-Christian Ströbele, a member of the Green Party, his surprise meeting with Snowden in Russia was about the conditions under which the former intelligence officer would testify before a German prosecutor's office or a committee of inquiry.
Snowden has referred to his complicated legal situation, Ströbele told ARD magazine "Panorama".
A rescue package of 325 million Australian dollars for Tasmanian healthcare
The Australian government insists on the harsh conditions associated with the A$325 million bailout for Tasmanian healthcare to ensure that the federal government cannot waste the money.
Federal Minister for Health Tanya Plibersek has announced that the Commonwealth will take "immediate measures" to avert a crisis caused by an ageing population of the island nation, a higher rate of chronic diseases and systemic limitations.
The funding for a period of four years was decided after consultation with the Government of Independent Tasmanian Member of Parliament Andrew Wilkie.
The government has put together an emergency rescue package which we believe addresses the unique challenges facing the state, Plibersek said today.
The $325 million package includes $31 million in immediate election aid.
The remaining 2,600 surgeries, including orthopedic procedures and treatment for gray star, are to eliminate residues.
In addition, there is money for day-care in Hobart and Launceston, improved inpatient care, specialist training, mental health services and the introduction of a system for electronic recording of health data in local hospitals.
These investments are in line with the ideas that clinical staff concerned have told me were the best way to improve the Tasmanian health system, Tanya Plibersek said.
The Minister insisted on a strict reporting and accountability obligation for the Tasmanian Government.
The State must maintain the current level of funding to receive funds from the Commonwealth and report monthly on where the additional funds have been spent.
A three-member Commission is to be set up to ensure that the State provides health services as effectively and efficiently as possible.
As Wilkie explained today, the $325 million would be of little use unless it is accompanied by real reforms that will bring the public health system in Tasmania to a more sustainable course.
Despite this, he praised the government for responding to his request for urgent assistance, which he first expressed to the Prime Minister in early May.
I am confident that federal aid will make a major contribution to removing the state's public health system from the list of concerns, said Wilkie.
According to the federal government, these electoral benefits will largely compensate for the recent cuts.
But the opposition's health policy spokesman at the federal level, Peter Dutton, believes today's announcement is just a "flaster solution".
"We are in this situation because the Labor State government has withdrawn $430 million from the healthcare system", he told ABC TV.
It's not possible for a state government to rip almost half a billion dollars out of the system and put 300 million dollars into the Commonwealth and then pretend to be the good news.
Dutton called on Plibersek to guarantee that not a single dollar of the bailout package would be spent on additional bureaucracy.
Guillaume Nicloux's adaptation of Denis Diderot's novel convinces with exceptional production equipment and contemporary details, but it also requires heavier food.
Set in France in the 1760s, the story follows Suzanne, a young noble sent to the convent by her family.
When she rebels, she is confronted with the extreme cruelty of an extremely sadistic superior and becomes the object of erotic fascination by another.

The solemnity with which the film is told makes it a tormenting penitential shirt for the audience.
Syria has destroyed its ability to produce chemical weapons, according to a monitoring group
Syria destroyed important chemical weapons production facilities and gaseous munitions, the Global Chemical Weapons Monitoring Group said on Thursday, as heavy clashes broke out in the north of the country near one of the sites where supposedly toxic substances are stored.
Also on Thursday, a Syrian activist group announced that more than 120,000 people had been killed since the civil war began almost three years ago.
The announcement by the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) came a day before the deadline on
The first of November was the one set up by the Hague-based organization Damascus to destroy or render inoperable all chemical weapons production facilities, including all machines for mixing chemicals into poison gas and filling ammunition.
The completion of this process, which is basically the first stage of destruction, is an important milestone in an ambitious timetable aimed at the destruction of all Syrian chemical weapons by mid-2014.
The destruction of the facilities means that Syria can no longer produce new chemical weapons.
Damascus, however, has yet to begin destroying its existing weapons and supplies.
It is estimated that there are about 1,000 tons of chemicals and weapons in the country, including mustard gas and the nerve agent sarin.
The announcement came at a time when fighting was taking place in the town of Safira on Thursday, where experts say there is a chemical weapons production facility and warehouses, the UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said.
The activist group, which tracks the death toll through a network of activists in Syria, said on Thursday that 120,296 people had died.
Of these, 61,067 were civilians, including 6,365 children.
On the government side, 29,954 of them were members of President Bashar Assad's army, 18,678 were pro-government fighters and 187 were Lebanese Hezbollah militias.
Also among the dead were 2,202 deserters and 5,375 opposition fighters, many of them foreigners.
On July 25, the UN estimated the number of people killed in the conflict since March 2011 at 100,000.
This figure has not been updated so far.
The conflict has forced about two million people to flee the country.
Assad's forces have been fighting in Safira for weeks against the rebels, many of whom have ties to al-Qaeda groups.
The Observatory said there were casualties on both sides on Thursday, but gave no details.
The fighting highlights the danger posed by chemical weapons inspectors, whose mission to free Syria from its toxic arsenal is a race against time amid a raging civil war.
According to the OPCW, which works closely with the United Nations, the team is now convinced that it has seen and witnessed the destruction of all the major production and mixing/fill facilities mentioned by Syria.
Therefore, no further inspection activities are currently planned.
Earlier this week, the inspectors had declared that they had completed the first round of checks and visited 21 of the 23 sites identified by Damascus.
Due to security concerns, the two facilities were not visited, the inspectors said.
On Thursday, the OPWC stated that the two sites had been abandoned according to the Syrian statement ... and that the chemical weapons program facilities there had been moved to other facilities named for inspection.
It was not immediately clear whether the Safira site was one of the two facilities that the OPCW inspectors were unable to visit.
Syria has submitted a plan for the complete destruction of its chemical weapons, which must be approved by the OPWC Executive Committee next month.
I salute the courage and courage you all have shown in carrying out the most challenging mission ever undertaken by this organisation, said Ahmed Uzumcu, Director-General of the Monitoring Organisation, in a commentary published by the OPCW.
For three years now, the mainly Sunni Muslim rebels have been fighting a split in Shiite Islam in this civil war against Assad's government and its security forces, which include many members of the Alawites.
In view of further developments, the head of the observation group, Rami Abdurrahman, said there was a strong explosion on Wednesday in an air defense facility in the Syrian coastal province of Latakia.
The cause of the explosion is unknown, he explained.
Anger over the verdict on Bali bombers
Survivors and relatives of the 202 people who died in the 2002 Bali bombing reacted angrily to the verdict of the last of the instigators, who was brought to trial because they believed Umar Patek should be shot legally.
Patek, who was one of Southeast Asia's most wanted fugitives for nearly a decade, was sentenced to 20 years in prison yesterday for his role in building explosives for the bombing.
He could get fired after 15 years.
The 45-year-old was found guilty of mass murder for the attack on two nightclubs in Kuta's popular tourist district, which killed 202 people, including 88 Australians, and injured many more.
A guilty verdict was also entered on a number of terrorism-related charges, including a wave of bomb attacks on churches in Indonesia on Christmas Eve in 2000.
The prosecution had asked for a life sentence, even if it could have asked for the death penalty for the man, also known as "Demolition Man" for his reputation as a master bomber.
The decision has brought painful memories to June Corteen, a Perth-based mother who lost her 39-year-old twin daughters Jane and Jenny in the devastation caused by Patek and his accomplices nearly a decade ago.
She said with tears in her eyes that Patek should have been sentenced to death.
I really think he should follow in the footsteps of the other guys.
"He should be put before a firing squad", Corteen told AAP.
I have to live with the fact that I'm not going to have another grandchild and I'm never going to see my daughters again.
Sari Club was leveled on the ground when a massive bomb exploded in a small truck parked outside the nightclub shortly after 11 p.m. on October 12, 2002.
Peter Hughes was at Paddy's Bar, where just 20 seconds earlier a suicide bomber blew up a backpack full of explosives.
He went into a coma for a month after the attack and died three times while he was suspended from a life support system.
Hughes said Patek deserved the same fate as the three other members of the terrorist cell Jemaah Islamiah Amrozi, Mukhlas and Imam Samudra who were responsible for the bloodbath and executed four years ago.
Really, this guy should get the death penalty before anyone else.
To let him live? No, there's no reason to let him live.
Getting 20 years after killing 202 people and injuring hundreds is not much.
Patek is the last of the Bali bombers to stand trial.
He escaped almost a decade of detention, but was finally caught in January 2011 in the Pakistani city of Abbottabad, where US forces killed former al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden almost four months later.
During the hearing, an FBI agent said that intelligence reports indicated Patek was in Pakistan to meet bin Laden with the goal of re-establishing links between Southeast Asian terrorist groups and al-Qaeda.
He didn't turn himself in, Corteen said.
Until recently, he has shown no remorse for the suffering he has caused others.
The verdict came ahead of the 10th anniversary of the attack this year, which will be commemorated in Bali and Australia.
"There will be a lot of tears this year", Corteen said.
Patek can still appeal his verdict.
FAA: Passengers can now use electronic devices on planes (but not make phone calls)
Air travelers can now use their electronic devices from takeoff to landing to read, work, play, listen to music and watch movies, but not use their cell phones, according to new guidelines issued Thursday by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) in the United States.
However, passengers should not expect these changes to be implemented immediately.
The speed of implementation depends on the airline, FAA staff member Michael Huerta said at a press conference.
Air carriers must demonstrate to the FAA that aircraft comply with the new guidelines and that they have updated the flight crew training manuals and equipment stacking arrangements in accordance with the new rules.
The FAA stated that it had already received plans from some airlines to expand the use of portable electronic devices in aircraft.
These airlines included Delta and JetBlue.
Depending on the state of the plan, we could very soon approve the widespread use of electronic devices, the FAA announced in a statement.
Passengers must now turn off smartphones, tablets and other devices when the doors of the aircraft are closed.
You can only restart it when the plane has reached an altitude of three kilometers and the captain has given the green light.
When boarding the landing flight, passengers must turn it off again and must not take it off again before the aircraft has landed.
The new guidelines would allow airlines whose aircraft are electronically protected from interference to allow their passengers to use the equipment even at take-off, landing and on the rolling stock, the FAA explained.
Most new commercial aircraft and other aircraft which have been converted for use of Wi-Fi at higher altitudes should meet the criteria.
Laura Glading, President of the Professional Air Traffic Safety Association, welcomed the changes.
If the new scheme is implemented safely  and we work closely with the airline on this , both sides will benefit, Glading commented.
We're really tired of having to feel like guards on this issue.
However, internet connections to surf, exchange emails, text messages or download data within three kilometres remained prohibited, the Authority explained.
Passengers are asked to put their smartphones, tablets and other devices into flight mode.
So still no Words With Friends, the Scrabble-like online game that actor Alec Baldwin played on his smartphone in 2011 when he was forced to leave a jet of American Airlines publicly because he refused to turn off the device while the plane was parked on the runway.
And heavier devices like laptops still have to be packed, because there's a risk of injury if they fly through the cabin.
Telephone calls during the flight will also remain prohibited.
The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has the regulatory authority for telephone calls, not the FAA.
FAA may lift a ban on certain electronic devices at takeoff and landing
Last month, Mark Rosenker of the National Transportation Safety Board, a national traffic safety expert, told CBS News that cell phones were still considered a risk.
Mobile phones are really a problem, not only because they could potentially cause disruption to navigation devices, but because we know from the FCC that airborne transmission can also interfere with transmission masts, Rosenker says.
An industry advisory committee set up by the FAA to investigate this issue last month recommended that the government allow for a broader use of personal electronic devices.
In recent years, pressure has been increasing on the FAA to ease restrictions on use.
Critics such as Democratic Senator Claire McCaskill of Missouri believe there are no valid security grounds for the ban.
The restrictions are also becoming increasingly difficult to enforce as the use of devices has become ubiquitous.
Some studies have shown that up to one third of passengers forget or ignore the switch off.
The FAA began restricting the use of electronic devices by air travellers in 1966 after reports of navigation and communication equipment malfunctions were reported by passenger-carried UKW radios, which were the latest technology trend at the time.
New aircraft are far more dependent on electrical systems than previous generations of aircraft, but they are also designed and approved by the FAA so that they don't mind electronic interference.
Airlines have been offering passengers Wi-Fi for several years now when the altitude is reached.
Aircraft adapted to Wi-Fi systems are also less sensitive to interference.
The overwhelming majority of passenger aircraft should be suitable for the increased use of electronic devices under the new guidelines, Huerta said.
Today's electronic devices generally emit much less radio radiation than previous generations.
E-readers, for example, emit only minimal radiation when you scroll around.
However, when downloading or sending data, the transmission values are higher.
The Commission has also taken the view that the Commission should be able to take the necessary measures to ensure that the measures are implemented in a manner that is consistent with the objectives of the Union's internal market.
In 2011, company employees flew a passenger plane with a Kindle e-reader and made a test flight to detect problems, but could not detect any.
Members of the FAA Advisory Committee expressed mixed feelings about the risks of using equipment.
Douglas Kidd of the National Association of Airline Passengers said he believed the equipment disruption was real, even if the risk was minimal.
Other committee members said there were only isolated reports of pilots saying that aircraft systems were being disrupted by the equipment, and most of them were very old.
The Committee recommended, however, that the FAA allow pilots to order the passengers to turn off the equipment in poor visibility when instruments land.
A travel group welcomed the changes and described them as a reasonable adjustment for travellers who would be equipped with extensive technology today.
"We are pleased that the FAA recognizes that a pleasant passenger experience is not at odds with safety", said Roger Dow, CEO of the U.S. Travel Association.
Air rescue service rescued from North Sea Island bird released
A bird that had been found exhausted on a North Sea island by air rescue service was released back into the wild.
The watermelon was flown by helicopter to Aberdeen last month, where it was picked up by the Scottish animal protection organisation SPCA at their Alloa rescue centre.
Colin Seddon, head of the centre, said: "This water squirrel was probably a wintering bird from northern Europe, held up by the strong winds over the North Sea".
Apparently, the exhausted bird was seeking refuge on the island.
He added: "He could no longer fly, so we were contacted with a request for help".
When she was released, the water was back in shape and healthy.
Is the European elite ready to do business with Britain?
Business for Britain was launched in April with the aim of bringing the economy to a meeting and defining what those who provide prosperity and jobs in the UK want to change in our relations with the EU.
To this end, we commissioned the largest and most comprehensive survey of British business leaders and asked them what they thought of Britain, the economy and the EU.
YouGov surveyed over 1,000 business executives, covering UK business sizes, sectors and regions.
The results of the survey will surprise many.
We found that the vast majority of companies are now exporting outside Europe and focusing on countries that are modernizing and growing while EU countries are stagnating.
They want the government to promote new trade links with countries like China, India and Brazil, rather than stopping the long and arduous process of reforming the obscure EU institutions.
When asked about certain legal issues  from antitrust law to product law , the majority of business leaders believe that control of these key competences should be withdrawn to Westminster.
There was general dissatisfaction with the single market, as companies claimed that the costs of Brussels regulations would now outweigh the benefits of being part of the European trading area  even 40% of large companies agreed with the ones that are traditionally the most European-friendly.
Finally, and this is probably the most telling, our survey of business leaders showed that a clear majority wants Britain to take a course towards changing the agreement and a relationship with the EU based on trade, not politics.
This finding, which is found in companies of all sizes and leading groups, shows that the economy is pushing for a meaningful change that will bring the burden of doing business back to the UK.
It is a lot about changing the agreement and better conditions for Britain would lead to a 16 per cent change of opinion in favour of remaining in the EU in a referendum.
The Prime Minister should have no doubt: this survey shows that the British economy is behind his plan to renegotiate the UK's terms of EU membership.
It also shows that companies expect a significant shift in power relations back to the UK from a renegotiation.
A better deal for the British economy is possible and increasingly necessary as the eurozone moves towards closer economic and fiscal union.
The priority must be jobs and growth in the UK, as our survey results show, which means for companies a greater focus on trade and a fundamental change in the Brussels approach to regulation.
Alexei Miller of Gazprom calls Bulgaria's pipeline the beginning of a new gas era
The construction of the South Stream pipeline in Bulgaria marks the start of one of Europe's largest energy projects, the Gazprom Executive Board said.
Today's event is a milestone: construction work on the Bulgarian section of the South Stream gas pipeline, the largest and most important project in Europe, has begun, Gazprom CEO Alexei Miller said in a statement on Thursday.
The project is a key element of energy security for the whole European continent.
South Stream is to provide more diversity in Russia's export routes through Europe.
A contract dispute between Gazprom and its Ukrainian counterparts, where most of the Russian gas is stored for Europe, poses an increased risk on conventional routes, as is officially reported.
Miller said that the direct link to Bulgaria, a member of the European Union, meant that the geopolitical risks associated with transit countries were permanently off.
Bulgarian consumers will receive gas from South Stream at discounted rates when the entire project goes into operation in 2015.
Gazprom said construction work in other sub-regions on the planned route would begin by the end of the year.
The pipeline is designed to have an annual capacity of 62.3 billion cubic metres of natural gas.
For national and international investors, Germany is a real estate location.
The economic framework is correct and the financing options are excellent.
This was the tenor of the 9th real estate day of the stock exchange.
The German real estate markets benefit from the economic strength and the good economic conditions in the country compared to Europe.
This was stated by Christian Ulbrich, CEO Europe, Middle East and Africa at Jones Lang LaSalle, at the 9th Stock Exchange Real Estate Day.
The volume of transactions shows how much German commercial property is sought, Ulbrich said.
In the first three quarters of this year, it increased by 31% compared to the previous year.
In the UK, the increase was only 6%, in France it was 19%.
"Real estate investments offer attractive interest rates", Ulbrich said.
The yield gap between real estate and federal bonds was at a historically high level.

Hearing before the Royal Commission: Two YMCA staff accused of sexual offences against Jonathan Lord
Two YMCA staff from New South Wales (NSW) were charged with child sexual offences before charges were brought against Caringbah childcare provider Jonathan Lord in 2011, as the Royal Commission learned of child sexual abuse.
However, in the opening statement to the Commission, the YMCA had stated that it had never had any sexual abuse of children in the organisation.
Managing Director Phillip Hare was interviewed about a case in which a YMCA employee was charged with child pornography offences and another in which a YMCA Caringbah Hall sports teacher was convicted in 1991 of abusing children entrusted to him.
Hare told Gail Furness, an assistant attorney for the Commission, that he knew about the first case but didn't know about the second.
It acknowledged that the opening statement of the YMCA to the Commission was also inaccurate in the claim that it had given external reviews of the YMCA in which the YMCA was recognised as a leading provider of child safety.
Rather, evidence before the Commission shows that the YMCA was informed that it received the second lowest rating out of four possible in a quality audit by the Department of Education and Communities in August of this year.
Hare, who started at the YMCA at 21, admitted that management failed to recruit Lord from me downwards and failed to ensure that employees were aware of their obligations to report violations of child safety guidelines.
Lord was convicted earlier this year of sexual assault of 12 boys during his two-year stint with the YMCA.
He was sentenced to at least six years in prison.
Hare, however, denied that the YMCA had a cultural problem that prevented employees from reporting Lord's violations of child safety.
The staff said they had observed violations, including Lord being alone with children, taking care of them privately as babysitters, letting them sit on his lap, telling one he loved it, and letting children play with his cell phone.
Danielle Ockwell, whose supervisor was Lord and who had asked for child protection training because she was concerned about his behavior, said that the child services manager Jacqui Barnat, who was the supervising lord at the YMCA Caringbah, was "very intimidating and most of the time very inaccessible".
The Managing Director stated that he would not accept statements by employees that they had not dared to report to their supervisor.
Instead, he said, their friendship with Lord had impaired their judgment, so they wouldn't report him.
Hare stated that he had communicated to the Board of YMCA NSW his view that the lesson the organisation should learn from the Jonathan Lord incident was not related to the reporting by staff and the Board agreed.
Hare said the decision to press employees to sign confidentiality agreements shortly after the allegations were made was made by the YMCA's chief child services officer, Liam Whitley.
He said that this was to prevent contamination of the evidence, but that it was overly zealous and poorly implemented.
The YMCA NSW was not a safe organisation for children during the time Jonathan Lord was employed there between 2009 and 2011, Professor Stephen Smallbone of Griffith University, an expert on child sexual abuse, told the Commission.
He explained that there were serious problems with recruiting, verifying, training and supervising staff.
The hearing was postponed until 20 December.
Tony Blair has stated that he would take the chance of returning as British Prime Minister but admits that a comeback is unlikely.
In an interview this evening on the fifth anniversary of his departure from office, the 59-year-old expressed his views on various domestic policy issues.
Since stepping down in June 2007 after a decade as head of state, Blair has largely avoided commenting on British politics, and his comments have mostly been limited to foreign policy and his role as ambassador to the Middle East Peace Quartet.
When asked if he would like to return to the office of prime minister, Blair was quoted by the London Evening Standard as saying: "Yes, sure, but it's unlikely that that will happen, so ...
When the horse show experts gathered in crowds in Cardiff to race the horse of the year, they were aware that a fierce competition was imminent.
But no one was prepared for the three-year-old Fenton Kirkland.
The kid, who is not even in kindergarten and only made his first steps a few months ago, and his Shetland Pony Toffee made it through the three rounds and won the first prize, leaving 30 adult opponents behind.
The inseparable pair, both of the same size, were praised for their appearance, behavior and style at the annual competition held at the Sunnybank Equestrian Centre in Rudry, near Cardiff.
When he competed against men and women with elegant melons, he had set his plate cap at a slight angle and led the two-year-old toffee through the ring.
Fenton was praised by the jury for his natural skills in handling the pony, which are far beyond his age.
And Toffee got top marks for his looks and personality.
Fenton had received Toffee as a gift for his third birthday last March and has been training with the Shetland pony every day since.
His mother, Donna, 30, said, "Fenton and Toffee are a great team.
They had to compete against the entire field of play and left the field with the Gold Cup and Rosette.
It was only the second time he had entered a contest with toffee, and we were all thrilled when he won.
Strangers in the arena thought he was so phenomenal that they wanted to be photographed with him.
The little boy from the village of Nantyglo near Ebbw Vale, South Wales, follows in the footsteps of his aunt Sharon Howells, who has been riding horses for over a decade.
Howells said, "The whole audience was electrified and everyone fired and clapped".
He ran on sand all the way through the arena, and although he looked so tiny, he did fantastic work.
Fenton is crazy about animals. He loves horses, tractors, farms, and he has two chickens to take care of.
The way he started, it won't be long before he's on the horse of the year show and I'm sure he'll finish well.
A spokesman for the annual horse show said, "Fenton is only three, but he knows how to handle his pony".
They're a great team together.
The judges rated Fenton and Toffee based on how well they had done and how well they had presented themselves in the show ring.
They're looking for good cooperation between Pony and the Führer, and Fenton and Toffee were the best in the ring.
I'm sure Fenton's cute clothes did their part, which was a perfect fit for the occasion.
The Chinese newspaper is to be reformed after a call
A Chinese newspaper that had made a front page demand for the release of a reporter accused of defamation should be reformed, a press regulator said.
The Guangzhou-based Neue Express had printed a rare public appeal for the release of journalist Chen Yongzhou.
But Chen later admitted on television that he had accepted bribes to falsify reports about a subnational company.
The new Express is now undergoing a 'comprehensive' correction, the regulator said.
The rectification order was issued by the Guangdong Press and Publications, Radio, Film and Television Authority.
The Commission also examined whether the measures were compatible with the internal market and whether the measures were compatible with the internal market.
The editorial management of the New Express was disorderly, the regulator announced in a statement.
She said it was decided to impose an administrative penalty on Chen Yongzhou and revoke his journalist's license.
The Yangcheng Evening News Group was also instructed to complete a correction of the New Express and recommended that the relevant authorities of the New Express be identified and that the New Express management team be reviewed immediately.
Chen had written several articles for the New Express reporting on alleged financial irregularities at a construction machinery manufacturer called Zoomlion.
After his arrest, the paper published two calls for his release on the front page and supported his journalistic work.
But then Chen appeared on state television and admitted to posting false reports for payment.
In this case, I have damaged Zoomlion as well as the entire news industry and its ability to gain public trust, he told state broadcaster CCTV.
I did it primarily because I wanted money and fame.
I realized I was doing the wrong thing.
Following Chen's apology, the New Express published an apology on the front page, stating that the reports were not properly verified.
Several known suspects have recently made confessions on television.
Experts say confessions are still routinely forced, despite a law change earlier this year that prohibited authorities from forcing anyone to blame themselves.
Drug tunnel discovered with its own railroad between the US and Mexico
One of the most sophisticated drug trafficking tunnels between the United States and Mexico, fully equipped with lighting, ventilation and electric train operation, has now been discovered.
The U.S. authorities described the 120 by 90 centimeter tunnel as one of the most sophisticated passages they had ever found.
The tunnel, which runs along a zither pattern of nearly six football fields, connects warehouses near Tijuana, Mexico, with San Diego, U.S.A.
There are countless unseen warehouses in the area, making it easier to hide drug-laden trucks.
The tunnel was closed before drugs could be unrecognized, the authorities said.
The tunnel's discovery was said to have secured eight and a half tons of marijuana and 148 kilograms of cocaine, court records show.
Three men who were drivers, according to authorities, were charged with possession and intent to sell marijuana and cocaine.
You face a sentence of 10 years to life in prison if you plead guilty.
In Nogales, Arizona, smugglers are putting on an extensive underground network of drainage channels.
The tunnel is the eighth major passageway discovered in San Diego since 2006.
Some of the biggest tunnels were discovered after the Marijuana harvest in central Mexico in October, which puts the drug cartels at the challenge of getting their product to consumers quickly.
In 2010, authorities found a nearly 2,000-foot (640 m) railroad passageway that ran from a kitchen in a Tijuana apartment building to two warehouses in San Diego.
Orlando Bloom and Miranda Kerr are still in love.
Actor Orlando Bloom and model Miranda Kerr are planning to go their separate ways.
However, in an interview, Bloom said that he and Kerr still love each other.
Miranda Kerr and Orlando Bloom are the parents of two-year-old Flynn.
Actor Orlando Bloom has announced his separation from his wife, top model Miranda Kerr.
In an interview with U.S. journalist Katie Couric, which was scheduled to air on Friday (local time), Bloom said, "Life sometimes doesn't go exactly as we plan or hope".
Kerr and he still loved each other, the 36-year-old stressed.
"We will support and love each other as Flynn's parents".
Kerr and Bloom have been married since 2010, and in 2011 their son Flynn was born.
The lexicon says that veganism is subject to vegetarianism, but it is quite different from it.
Because while vegetarians can afford to eat cream cakes, ice cream, or a strong Edamer, these pests are not on a vegan's menu.
Milk, cheese, eggs, meat and fish are not only forbidden, but also veganism is forbidden.
What remains, you may wonder, but when you look closely, the vegan diet is characterized by a considerable amount of ingenuity.
"Bread slices are very popular", explains Ute Henkelmann, the owner of the local reform house, which has a variety of special products for vegans.
Reuben Proctor likes to visit the shop on Domgasse too.
For 13 years, the New Zealander has been a vegan, and in Lamperheim he has found (almost) everything he needs for life.
And then at the turn of the century, the next step was taken, and I became a vegan.
"The reason for the conviction was not just the diet, but the choice of shoes", says Proctor, who prefers leather to normal leather.
I realized that there are other everyday issues that are not animal products.
First of all, being vegan is ethical.
"I don't want animals to die for me", Proctor says, "the maxim of vegans that extends to all consumption behavior".
Instead of chasing burgers, chicken breasts or rubber bears, the vegan quickly discovered brand new products, and the enthusiasm grew.
"It's a double bonus", Proctor says today, "in fact, being vegan is not a waiver, not an asceticism, but it's an enrichment". The assumption that changing your diet reduces the choice of food options, Proctor is more likely to attribute to the power of habit.
And it is precisely these conditions that have caused some of the best-intentioned attempts to fail.
"Addiction is a very important factor that makes many quit quickly, much like smoking", Proctor compares.
And he says, "Some flavors are not to be fixed on the animal".
Often, it is the spices or the type of preparation that make up the taste.
"But you can also produce the same effect in other ways", explains the vegan.
For example, Proctor brings eggplants, champignons, and a few vegan sausages to a barbecue.
He is careful to maintain a balanced, varied diet that is good for a good taste.
Of course, you want something between your teeth, which is legitimate.
"It's supposed to taste good, but it's not just animal food", Proctor said.
Health damage to eating disorders, another common assumption, he did not suffer.
I thought the change was a positive thing.
I don't take any foreign cholesterol and I have a high vitamin intake.
There are high-performance athletes who eat exclusively vegan.
"My blood levels are excellent, I get checked often", explains Proctor.
Many vegan critics warn of vitamin B12 deficiency in particular.
"Because animals are fed feed rather than grazing on pasture, it is questionable whether the meat you buy in the fridge is high in vitamin B12", says Proctor.
Vegans also have the option of taking the coenzyme in tablet form.
"My B12 levels are fine", he explains.
Proctor doesn't have to go far to get food.
After all, basic food is everywhere and every supermarket now has soy milk and other products.
I can find everything I need on the spot.
I just buy something special every now and then.
"Many people overlook that only finished products are expensive, but it is well known that 'ordinary' finished products are expensive".
In addition, the preparation of vegan dishes is far cheaper and less time consuming than is commonly believed.
"There's a lot to discover in the home kitchen, and with a few small tricks you can get good, if not partially better results", says Proctor.
Margarine instead of butter, a little more baking powder and carbohydrate instead of egg, and with his vegan cheesecake, Proctor was able to surprise his in-laws.
Family parties give vegans a new flavor.
It's dynamic, and when you cook together, it's a new priority.
"The situations that can arise are as different as people themselves", says Proctor.
Of course, he was also sceptical.
Don't you like my food anymore?
"Should I feel bad now because I drink milk?" - such questions require a vegan to act with a finger-pointed sense.
"I don't reject people, I'm part of this society", Proctor says, "and I don't want to expose the existence of enclaves".
And when you look at it more closely, the everyday world doesn't seem as vegan as it's supposed to be, and the vegan isn't as restricted in everyday life as it's commonly believed.
Fast food is also allowed.
There's potatoes everywhere!
"Many doner shops offer falafel, or just a vegetarian yufka", says Proctor.
In a pizzeria, he's just going to skip pastries, or order a pizza without cheese, all a matter of habit.
The restaurants are so slow to respond.
"When I started eating vegan 13 years ago, things were much more difficult", says the New Zealander, "you have to talk to people, get them to pay attention".
"If enough demands come in, they may be inclined to supplement the menu", he hopes.
Veganized restaurants are developing, such as the combo in Mannheim or the Bird Free Café.
Proctor wishes that other restaurants have at least one vegan dish on the menu as well.
Basically, vegan dishes are for everyone.
Anyone can eat them, so they're the exact opposite of exclusive.
"Meat dishes, on the other hand, are exclusive, in the truest sense of the word, because they exclude others", notes Proctor.
"If you want to avoid food scandals, veganism is a sure way to make the most of it impossible from the start", says Proctor.
But buying vegan products can be a little difficult at first.
In particular, when one learns that peanuts can contain animal additives as colourants, one seems to quickly lose courage in following ethics in the face of so many obstacles and traps.
Not only that, but Reuben Proctor and Lars Thomsen have written a book entitled "Veganissimo - Animal Ingredients and Their Alternatives" which explains the many ingredients that are added to food and also to cleaning products.
"You're gradually developing a scanner view and you know which signs and logos to look out for.
Veganism is an important moral indicator that strikes the consciousness.
It may not be able to completely stop its habits, but at least it can teach consumers to critically question their habits.
The NASDAQ OMX is keeping its customers in the air.
Trading on the Nasdaq Options Market was suspended on Friday afternoon.
In a communication, the operator blamed technical problems.
The other 11 US options markets, including two of the Nasdaq OMX, continued their business unimpeded.
The recent incident continues a whole series of smaller and larger gaps at the stock exchange operator.
Only on Tuesday had the Nasdaq indices been out of the loop for an hour due to data transmission errors.
In August of this year, there were two breaks in one week alone.
First, the US investment bank Goldman Sachs had sent out massive error-prone purchase orders to the options markets because of technical problems.
Then it took the stock market operators almost a whole day to look through the orders and delete them.
Two days later, half of all stock trading in the United States was shut down for several hours because of a computer malfunction on the Nasdaq exchange.
The publicity of Facebook last year also caused a sensation.
Nasdaq systems had not been able to cope with the flood of buy and sell orders, the SEC later determined and diluted the company to a record $10 million fine.
Constanz: Radler is killing 63-year-old
The accident occurred on Thursday evening, at about 10 p.m., when a 26-year-old man was driving a woman's bicycle illegally on the left sidewalk from the train station to the market.
When a 63-year-old man suddenly stepped onto the sidewalk from a local area, the cyclist could no longer brake in time, police said.
The next collision involved a pedestrian being pushed against the wall of the house, and he continued on to the ground, drawing a square wound about 15 centimeters long to his head.
An ambulance team took the injured to the hospital for medical treatment.
British police are issuing an extradition order to Assange
The British police today handed over an extradition order to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who sought refuge at the Ecuadorian embassy in London and applied for asylum.
Scotland Yard said the 40-year-old Australian had received a "call to appear" at a police station, adding that he could face arrest if he did not comply.
Assange is threatening extradition to Sweden on charges of sexual misconduct after his UK legal options have been exhausted since the Supreme Court rejected his extradition challenge earlier this month.
Fearing that Stockholm would extradite him to the United States, he sought refuge at the Ecuadorian embassy in London on 19 June and asked the South American country for political asylum.
Scotland Yard sent a call to a 40-year-old man to appear at a police station at a time of our choosing, a spokesman said.
He continues to violate the terms of his release on bail.
The embassy did not comment on the delivery of the police summons.
Assange fears he will be extradited from Sweden to the United States and charged there with possible espionage charges after posting over 250,000 diplomatic messages on the WikiLeaks disclosure website.
Drivers who were driving at 210 km/h and drinking hot drinks between their legs will be fined £1,000
A driver was fined £1,000 for driving at speeds of up to 210 km/h and a hot drink between his legs.
Andrew Howie, 35, of Tiptree, Essex, was stopped on May 27th by his Mercedes Benz on the A120 near Braintree.
After the police stopped him, they discovered the drinking cup between his legs.
In Colchester County Court, Howie pleaded guilty to driving without due care and attention.
He got seven points and a six-month driving ban.
Howie was also ordered to pay costs of £90 and a £100 compensation.
Tax on foreign property owners against London's speculative bubble
The Ministry of Finance has provisionally reviewed the CGT measure but is still awaiting the final decision of Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne, who in the 2012 budget imposed a 7% stamp duty on apartments costing over £2 million and annual fees for buyers who keep apartments as a company rather than as individuals.
The Commission has already established that the revenue from the stamp duty on housing in Westminster and Kensington & Chelsea, which was £708 million in the 2012/13 tax year, exceeds the revenue for Northern Ireland, Wales, Scotland, the North East, North West, Yorkshire and the Humber Region combined.
Cook said: Following the increase in stamp duty on high-priced housing and the introduction of related legislation against circumvention, it is difficult to say that high-quality real estate is taxed too low, despite the impact of the outdated municipal tax system.
However, this step could make some foreign investors more reluctant to buy real estate in London or to prevent owners from selling it, he added.
First-class real estate, the top five to ten percent of the housing market by price in London's affluent South West, stretching from Fulham to Wimbledon, has risen to a record 11.8 percent last year.
Prices in central London were growing at a flat annual rate of 5.6%, but were overshadowed by an emerging domestic market, with the southwest, northern (7.4%) and eastern (6.5%) parts of the city experiencing an upward trend, according to a Savills study.
Scientists have been able to shed more light on the relationship between a dog's tail-walking and his mood.
Previous research had shown that happy dogs with tails waved more to the right (from the dog's point of view), while nervous dogs waved to the left.
But now scientists say that other dogs can sense and respond to these subtle differences.
Professor Georgio Vallortigara, a neuroscientist at the University of Trent, said: "It is well known that the left and right hemispheres of the human brain respond differently to stimuli that produce positive or negative emotions.
So here we tried to look at this in other species.
He also noted that in dogs, just like in humans, the right brain is responsible for the movement of the left side and vice versa, and that the two hemispheres play different roles in emotions.
To learn more about how dogs respond to the lateral tail waving of their species, the researchers monitored the animals as they watched these films of other dogs.
They measured the heart rate of the quadriplegics and analyzed their behavior.
We'll probably soon understand why the tail moves one way or the other.
Professor Vallortigara said: "We showed the dogs movies with dogs either a natural version or a silhouette to eliminate distractions and we could control the movement of the tail more to the left or right".
When the animals saw a dog with no expression moving its tail to the right (from the perspective of the stray dog), they remained completely relaxed.
But if the swallowing was mainly left-handed (again from the dog's perspective), her heart rate increased and she looked restless.
Professor Vallortigara believes that dogs do not communicate with each other through these movements.
He is convinced that the dogs learned from experience what movements to be concerned about and when not to.
He said, "If you have different encounters with other dogs and the tail barking in one direction is more associated with friendly behavior and the right side is more likely to produce less friendly behavior, then you react based on those experiences".
The researchers say that the findings could help dog owners, veterinarians, and trainers to better understand their pet's emotions.
John Bradshaw, a specialist in dog behaviour and hospitality at the University of Bristol's Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, said this was not the first study to examine whether the left and right were important for dogs.
Last year, a team at the University of Lincoln found that dogs turn their heads to the left when they look at an aggressive dog, and to the right when it's a contented dog.
Another study at the University of Victoria in Canada stated that dogs are more likely to approach a robot dog when its tail is waving to the left rather than to the right, rather than becoming restless.
According to him, the differences could therefore be explained by the fact that the dogs in the various studies did not interpret the animals in the films or the robot dogs as dogs.
He explained that a study of how dogs react to real dogs could help.
While there is considerable evidence for many different mammals that the two halves of the brain are used for different purposes, many details are yet to be determined  and dogs are no exception, Bradshaw says.
But since their behavior is easily recorded, it probably won't be long before we understand why the tail sometimes moves in one direction, sometimes the other.
Arctic Monkeys postponed their Glasgow tour due to Alex Turner's illness
The rock band Arctic Monkeys have postponed a gig in Glasgow after their lead singer developed a sore throat.
The band from Sheffield was supposed to play at the Hydro on Friday.
However, due to the illness of lead singer Alex Turner, the concert must now be postponed.
The band's announcement came after they had to postpone a performance at the LG Arena in Birmingham on Thursday.
In a statement on their official website, the Arctic Monkeys announced: After the decision to cancel the show at the LG Arena in Birmingham tonight and on medical advice, the Arctic Monkeys must also cancel the show at Hydro in Glasgow on Friday, November 1.
Alex Turner was diagnosed with a sore throat, which unfortunately prevents him from showing up.
The show at the LG Arena in Birmingham is now taking place on 20 November, which has been moved to Hydro in Glasgow on 21 November.
All tickets to these shows remain valid.
We apologize to all ticket holders for any inconvenience this has caused.
Please contact the customer service at the points of sale where you purchased your ticket if you need further assistance.
Pope Francis Appoints First Cardinals in February
Pope Francis will be appointing new Catholic cardinals for the first time on February 22, as the Vatican announced on Thursday.
Cardinals are the highest ranking clergy in the Catholic Church after the pope and they are also the ones who elect a pope, so that Francis will appoint the first group of men who will ultimately participate in the election of his successor.
There are 201 cardinals at present.
However, a cardinal who has reached the age of 80 can no longer participate in the papal election  this is the case for a group of 120  elected cardinals.
In a statement announcing the news, Father Federico Lombardi, a Vatican spokesman, said that a meeting of all the cardinals will be held before the ceremony to appoint the new cardinals, also known as the consistory.
Pope Francis has decided to announce his decision to convene the consistory in February in advance so that other meetings that require the participation of cardinals from around the world can be planned, Lombardi said.
Jack Valero of Catholic Voices said the number of elected cardinals will likely be down by February.
He explained that a pope usually recruits as many cardinals as necessary so that the number of eligible cardinals is 120 again, and as many cardinals over 80 as he wants.
The consistory next year is therefore important because it is the first since the election of Pope Francis in March this year, Valero said.
There is a certain overlap in Europe and in Italy in particular.
It will be interesting to see if the new pope will appoint cardinals from the rest of the world to restore the balance, he said.
Forty percent of Catholics live in South America, but they have only a tiny number of cardinals.
The cardinals will also be the first to be called since the formation of the Council of Cardinals, a group of eight cardinals from around the world tasked with finding ways to reform the church.
In the past, the Pope decided everything alone.
"Now Francis has chosen these eight cardinals to help him", Valero said.
He said it was possible for Francis to ask the cardinals for advice.
But we haven't been able to do that before.
Valero said that bishops in large places would typically be called cardinals, but Francis is full of surprises, so we don't know who he's appointing.
GM is recalling new pickup trucks in the U.S. to repair the seatbelts
General Motors is recalling nearly 19,000 of its brand-new Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra pickup trucks from 2014 to address a problem with the manual adjustable seatback, the U.S. vehicle safety regulator said Friday.
Some cars may have a defect in the front seat seat restraint mechanism.
For this reason, they do not comply with the Federal Guidelines on Vehicle Safety on Headrest.
If the head restraint is not properly protected by the rear-end vehicle, there may be an increased risk of injury, the message on the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) website read.
The recalled models were manufactured between 1 August and 10 September.
The delivery of GM trucks started in June and represents the most important model launch of the leading US automaker since the insolvency restructuring in 2009.
GM informed the vehicle owners of the defect in the first half of October.
The NHTSA was unable to review the notification letter due to the 16-day government shutdown, which had a negative impact on car sales in October.
Sales of the Silverado and Sierra trucks, which were redesigned for the 2014 model year, increased by 20 percent in the first ten months of the year, GM said on Friday.
In October, GM sold 42,660 Silverado and 16,503 Sierra pickup trucks.
GM stock rose 1.4 percent on the New York Stock Exchange to $37.47 on Friday afternoon.
The desperate cry of an Obama voter
I voted for President Obama twice in the hope that change would be possible.
He says Obama has made a commendable effort that has been thwarted by the Republican blockade tactics.
The blockade policy doesn't excuse the problems with Obamacare's website, the drone strikes.
Obama's memoir of the 2008 campaign is a sad reminder of what could have been possible.
Nathaniel P. Morris is a sophomore at Harvard Medical School.
I'm reading a terribly sad book right now.
It's a book I thought would cheer me up and give me hope again during my dubious second year of medical school.
It's called The Audacity to Win and it's based on Barack Obama's memoir of the 2008 presidential election.
When I finish my patient records at night and go to bed, the book takes me back to a time when politics inspired millions and took the breath away from a speech.
The election was a landslide victory and news anchors stopped to highlight the historical significance of this hour.
My classmates cried out in tears of joy, and my parents collected every newspaper they could find.
A young team of visionaries was on their way to the White House, and the nation was ready for change.
When Obama took office in 2008, he had a turnout of 82 percent.
And then I close the book.
Switching back to the present is an evil awakening, like being torn from a dream.
It's hard to remember those optimistic times. They seem to be a vague memory, a sad reminder of missed opportunities.
In the years since I first cast my vote, something has actually changed.
But it's just not what I could have imagined.
I recognize the great and versatile things Obama has accomplished, from passing the Affordable Care Act for health insurance to the military withdrawal from Iraq, ending the forced secrecy of homosexuality in the military and killing Osama bin Laden.
I too believe that the party-led blockade tactics have derailed too many efforts to move our nation forward: immigration reform, a public health insurance option, and the closure of Guantanamo Bay, to name a few.
But after defending the Obama administration countless times to colleagues and acquaintances, I've come to the end of my attempts at explanation.
I've reached a point of political despair.
The Republican blockade policy cannot explain why it allows foreign heads of state to be interrogated or innocent children killed by drones overseas.
It cannot explain why the National Security Agency collects data on Americans' private lives and why whistleblowers are punished for revealing government misconduct.
It cannot explain why Anwar al-Awlaki, an American citizen, was murdered without trial, nor why public funding and spending limits are circumvented during the presidential election.
It doesn't justify the findings of a report that the White House's efforts to calm the media are the most aggressive since the Nixon administration.
And lastly, it can't excuse the inability to design a simple website in the more than three years since the Affordable Care Act was passed.
I don't know if this is what I should have expected.
I wondered if I should have understood at 18 that government work could contradict their previous political campaigns.
Obviously, the House is not a predictable course, as an opposition party and random events like the Newtown massacre shape the public debate.
But if I look at the examples above, they seem to have been largely elected by the government itself.
And that's what bothers me the most.
I voted for Obama again in 2012, not because I was excited about his candidacy.
Mitt Romney was a confusing and unproven alternative, he seemed unable to determine his direction and position.
I had the impression that a second term for Obama, free from the pressures of future elections, would fulfill the hope we had heard of for so long.
But with the Obama vote falling to less than 45 percent this week, going back to 2008 has become even harder because of this book.
It awakens in me the longing for the many promises that have been shattered in the air.
This week I read a section in the book that describes how Obama had to suffer a major loss to Clinton in the primary in Pennsylvania.
In a meeting with the voters after the decision, he told his staff that they should get back on track and follow the purpose of their cause.
"I want us to find our magic again", he said.
We need to remember who we are.
It's five years later, Mr. President, and I couldn't agree more with you.
The views expressed in this comment are exclusively those of Nathaniel Morris.
Clive Palmer claims Prime Minister Tony Abbott has a conflict of interest in parental leave
Billionaire and lawmaker Clive Palmer says Prime Minister Tony Abbott is in a conflict of interest with his plans for parental leave because his daughters get pregnant and could benefit from it.
The mining magnate, who is in court over the payment of $6 million in CO2 taxes, made the claim when he tried to wipe questions off the table about whether he was in a conflict.
The Palmer United Party could control up to four votes in the Senate that are important to deciding whether to remove or cut the CO2 and mining taxes.
But Palmer claimed that only ministers could have conflicts of interest and Abbott's daughters would personally benefit from the laws.
He is in a major conflict of interest when it comes to paid parental leave, because if one of his daughters becomes pregnant, he has a direct interest in whether or not she gets leave, Palmer said.
Two months after the election, the Electoral Commission officially declared Palmer the winner of the Sunshine Coast Fairfax seat with 53 votes.
Mr Palmer called for a review of the voting process to speed up the process.
Tony Abbott's daughters Frances and Bridget.
Should these elections be decided two months after the end of the voting period?
We need a better system, he said.
Why not have a system where you walk in, enter the data into a computer, immediately select, and then at 6:30 p.m. you get the result?
Palmer also criticized the use of pencils when marking ballots.
Do you use them because you can erase the results if you don't like them?
It's incredible to match with pencils these days.
The Electoral Commission has examined the options for electronic voting and recently published a joint legislative proposal with New Zealand.
Palmer, 59, said his policy was to have an international airport for the Sunshine Coast and that he would take his new position very seriously.
A public office is about public service.
We seek no reward other than that of history, namely that we can serve this community at a critical time, he said.
RBS suspends two foreign exchange traders
The Royal Bank of Scotland has suspended two traders from its currency department, two people familiar with the situation, further indicating that the global government investigation into alleged currency market manipulation is accelerating.
Some of the world's largest banks, including UBS, Barclays, Deutsche Bank and RBS, confirmed that they are working with authorities to investigate the world's largest financial market, which is changing hands every day for $5.3 trillion.
The two dealers would be the first RBS employees suspended in the expanding investigation that follows the Libor interbank scandal.
The Bank, which did not comment on the suspensions, confirmed this month that it had received requests for information from authorities.
Our investigation into this issue continues and we are fully cooperating with the FCA and other regulators, the bank said two weeks ago.
Last month, people familiar with the situation said that RBS had forwarded the records of emails and instant messages sent from and to a former trader to the UK's Financial Conduct Authority.
This trader, Richard Usher, had left RBS in 2010 and is now believed to have been licensed from his current position as European head of forex spot trading at JPMorgan.
Rohan Ramchandani, head of European spot trading at Citi, was dismissed this week and Matt Gardiner, formerly a senior currency trader at Barclays and UBS, was suspended this week at Standard Chartered.
None of these traders have been charged with any misconduct.
The Instant Message group of Usher included bankers at Barclays and Citigroup, people close to the situation said.
UBS announced this week that it had taken action against some of its employees after the Swiss regulator Finma stated that it was investigating a suspected manipulation of the foreign exchange market by a number of Swiss banks.
At least six authorities worldwide  the European Commission, Finma, the Swiss Competition Authority Weko, FCA, the US Department of Justice and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority  are currently dealing with allegations that bankers have agreed on transactions on the currency market.
HSBC, Citigroup, JPMorgan and Credit Suisse have also launched internal investigations or received inquiries from authorities, said people familiar with the situation.
Banks are scrolling through instant messages and emails from years in search of cases of misconduct.
The news of these investigations has upset traders in an area that has been one of the most profitable investment bank trading units in recent years, but this year has been under pressure because low volatility in currencies limits the chances for speculators.
Some bankers have tried to play down the affair, saying that it is almost impossible to manipulate the vast and highly liquid foreign exchange market, but leading traders believe that this is not necessarily true.
One leading trader noted that despite the enormous daily volume of foreign exchange trading, the fragmentation of liquidity between the various trading platforms and the increasing use of their own internal platforms by banks leads to the fact that man can influence the market even with very low ticket prices.
The news came the same day Credit Suisse announced it had terminated a London Exchange traded fund broker this week after causing a loss of nearly six million dollars at the end of last year.
The Bank promptly informed the competent authorities and cooperated with them.
We are confident that the trader acted alone and that the matter is contained, Credit Suisse explained.
Painted on the Bechtle plot
A group of citizens from the Swiss Weeds initiative has beautified the building site on the Bechtle plot on the curved promenade in Bad Herrenalb.
In addition, she cleaned and expanded the footpath, a press release says.
The planned coverage of the collapsing house at the rear of the property was not allowed for security reasons, as the site was in danger of collapse.
Alfred Abel, who currently manages the property, had agreed to the decoration with his colleague Reinhard Domke of the BI.
Before the BI action, a banner was posted with the message "We are for it".
The Commission has already adopted a number of proposals for a new directive on the protection of workers' rights.
Their motto on the big poster was "We're against Bauruen".
She was trying to point out the danger of even greater ruins on the Swiss meadow - if the giant project failed one day.
In a conversation with many passersby at the construction site, it became clear that some citizens believe that many will be better off with the implementation of the city project, although not a few have the same questions about the size of the project presented as the BI.
But they're starting to resign because the city is still delaying these answers, according to BI.
As you heard, the mayor's public statements also have an impact.
May had said at the municipal meeting that he feared the outcome of the thermal bathing, if the population voted against the plans for a swimming and wellness complex on the Swiss grassland in the citizen's decision.
Some seem to be scared of this, while others see it as a "plump blackmail" against the population, the BI press release said.
BI thanked the donors for the paint and all the help.
Rangnick shells for Shiris: Mane not a swallow king
As satisfied as Ralf Rangnick is with the current high form of Bundesliga champion Red Bull Salzburg, the Bulls' sports director was disappointed by the referees.
"There is a dangerous trend at the moment that Mane and Alan are being pushed into the swinging king category", he said at a press conference in Salzburg on Thursday.
Rangnick's latest criticism was Yellow for Mane in the 3-0 win over Grödig last Sunday, in which the Senegalese allegedly played a role in the disaster - which, of course, was not, as the TV images showed.
"It was a gross misjudgment", said Rangnick, who described Judge Harkam as "completely overwhelmed".
Harkam also contributed "his part" to the escalation between Salzburg coach Roger Schmidt and Grödig coach Adi Hütter after the game.
He defended his German compatriot, saying: "I would have acted in every situation the same way as Roger Schmidt".
Schmidt himself doesn't want to have had any contact with his colleague after the skirmish with Hütter.
I don't know why.
"Because I'm the one who was offended", the 46-year-old stressed.
But given the success, Ranknick sang a hymn of praise.
"There are only two words for that: really good", he noted.
There's not much to put off.
Especially the way the team plays is impressive.
Let's keep it that way.
There will be little change in the winter transfer window.
There's no great reason to change anything.
"Unless a player comes forward with the wish to leave the club", Rangnick explained.
Supreme Court upholds Obama's health care law
It's a big win for the Obama administration: the U.S. Supreme Court today ruled that the health care law closely tied to Barack Obama is constitutional.
By a vote of five to four, the judges ruled that the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act's single mandate  compels U.S. citizens to take out health insurance or pay a fine by 2014  is constitutional under the state's tax authority.
Chief Justice John Roberts sided with the four more liberal members of the House, while Judges Scalia, Thomas, Alito and Kennedy ruled against it.
The Court also upheld the remaining sections of the 2700-page law and also held that the provision of the Health Act that states should either extend Medicaid access requirements or otherwise eliminate all state Medicaid subsidies was not unconstitutional restrictive.
The lawsuit was filed by 26 states and the National Federation of Independent Business.
The bill had been strongly rejected by all leading Republican presidential candidates, including ultimate challenger Mitt Romney, in the 2012 primary.
Norway: A Norwegian village is getting a glow with huge mirrors
With huge mirrors, the inhabitants of a Norwegian village brought light into its dark valley.
Because of the low sunset, Rjukan, located in the Vestfjord valley, usually sinks in the shadow of the surrounding mountains from autumn to spring.
With three giant reflectors at 45 meters high, a century-old dream was realized on Wednesday.
"Finally!" shouted Mayor Steinar Bergsland at the launch ceremony on TV2.
Some valley dwellers put on sun chairs, others set on sunglasses for safety.
Until now, sun-hungry people had to ride a cable car to a nearby summit in winter.
Ten years ago, local artist Martin Andersen proposed that the rays be directed into the valley with mirrors.
But this basic idea has been around since 1913.
After years of debate, the city council finally approved the 5 million kronor (about 615 000 euro) project.
A similar structure has been providing winter sunshine for the Italian alpine town of Viganella for some years.
Post office is barely empty on Sundays
"Many citizens will not have noticed yet, the red dots for Sunday school are still on various mailboxes in the city centre and the city districts, but if you read the small printed paper on the yellow containers of Post AG, you will quickly find that the Sunday and holiday school is no longer empty", the FDP reports.
A request from the FDP confirmed this.
On Sundays and public holidays, the post office building at 36 Ernst-Ludwigstraße and 1 Jakob-Müllerstraße in Hüttenfeld is empty.
Whether or not the Hofheim and Rosengarten will be empty on Sunday is not answered in the response to the FDP's request.
The Social and Youth Policy spokesman for the FDP, Fritz Röhrenbeck, wants to come forward.
Sunday delivery is an important postal service at the time of appointment.
"This is a radical and unreasonable downturn in this enterprise despite the price increase for letters in January 2013".
Thomas Bittner, chairman of the Liberal Group and the city council, supports his colleague: "What bothers me is the fact that the vacant times are being changed or even deleted here in secret".
The post office is miles away from the city.
"At least the mailboxes in Neuschloß and Rosengarten must be emptied again on Sunday", said Bittner and Röhrenbeck unisono.
The same applies to the core city, especially non-mobile citizens, who would also need to be able to walk to a mailbox with Sunday phone calls.
Röhrenbeck asked the city council whether the city administration was planning to hold talks with the post office on the matter.
Mayor Erich Maier replied that the post had not communicated with Lampertheim.
But, as he knows, there is also a Sunday rally in Hofheim.
Your party has been in favour of privatization.
"Then decisions are made elsewhere", Maier said.
The Frankfurt motorway car park charges are set to rise sharply
Parking in Frankfurt could soon become more expensive.
The city magistrate is addressing a submission from the transport director Stefan Majer (Green) this morning.
The Commission has therefore proposed a 50% increase in parking charges.
The Commission has also proposed that the Commission should take the necessary measures to ensure that the public transport system is not affected by the new rules.
The city council will then have to decide in December.
The IHK Frankfurt's retail committee considers this "not a good idea".
The possibility of parking in front of the shop was 'an undeniable advantage for smaller retailers'.
The German Transport Club considers that an increase after two decades is "quite appropriate and in fact long overdue".
Public transport is also becoming more expensive.
Freudenstadt: Fast action surprises hosts
With a small squad, the TSV Freudenstadt's gentlemen I had to compete in the Schiller-Schulturhalle in Reutlingen against the TG Gönningen from the Swabian Alb.
The Elders were on the other side of the net with an experienced team.
But it soon became apparent that, even because of their age, they could not keep up with the rapid action of the cities of joy.
The hard and plastered beats made the Gönning extremely difficult.
They repeatedly missed the passes and attacks played by Simon Schenk and Eduard Schulz through the net and were not present at the blockade defense.
Two high first-round wins clearly showed the superiority of the cities of joy in all respects.
In view of this overwhelming and decisive performance, the third set was then won a little slowly and relentlessly to a final score of 3:0.
On 2 November, with the TV Baiersbronn, who has clearly established himself in Nagold, a much more powerful opponent will be on the field.
The Commission has also adopted a number of proposals for the establishment of a European Parliament and Council meeting on the subject of the European Parliament's proposal for a European Parliament and Council Directive on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data.
In the B-class, the second teams from Baiersbronn and Freudenstadt faced each other in the Murgtalhalle in Baiersbronn.
They delivered a fiercely contested two-hour match.
Nervousness on both sides caused errors and points gifts, especially in the ballgame; the passes were sometimes lacking in precision and in some critical game scenes, the rush prevented the view for possible points gains.
In this performance-balanced meeting, however, the great physical effort and a pleasant commitment of both teams were consistently consistent in the TSV team of Marcus Blasutto.
Day care at the little English cottage
On the fifth day of the Natura 2000 upper-hot forest project, a group of dedicated participants met at the small English cottage in Ibach.
Due to public suggestions, the area of the hut should be cleared of the valley view on this day, Mayor Helmut Kaiser said.
Many hikers, according to Emperors, called this area the glittering feature of the canyon ridge, where the landscape offers the ideal setting for magnificent views.
He thanked those present for their willingness to cooperate and stressed that the day of care was an appropriate instrument to strengthen the link between man and nature.
It gives every citizen the opportunity to put accents in nature itself.
The environmental aspect can also be taken into account in the tourism sector.
This environmental aspect was explained by Friederike Tribukait from the Nature Conservation Department of the Freiburg Government Presidency following the welcome by Land Councilman Bollacher, who had assumed the patronage and wished the action a good success.
The tourist objective of the long-term view is to preserve the now well-connected old common pasture with its specific protected habitat types by opening and connecting to the still existing pastures, according to Tribukait.
Certain species, such as rare butterflies and grasshoppers, cannot overcome forest-like barriers.
You need these free connections to keep the arteries.
Tribukait said she would not miss a launching point for the planned biosphere area.
The current measure is not only seamlessly integrated into this planning.
A biosphere area also offers the opportunity for sustainable economic and ecological development based on the internationally recognised Unesco status and thus a continuous complement to the life project and the current care days for the future.
After these various comments, district manager Christoph Wehle and Life project manager Cornelia Bischoff divided the helpers into groups.
The larger trees had already been struck in advance, and the logger was ready to call.
A group of helpers should be responsible for releasing the guard bushes and maintaining a dry stone bar.
The goal was to have a clear view of the viewpoint.
Löffingen: Köpfler is still the only candidate
Information on the Internet: Although Baarstädtchen Löffingen can be described as an attractive city with its 7514 inhabitants, an intact infrastructure, a forward-looking school, children, youth and senior policy, and its own urban works, no second candidate for mayor has yet been nominated.
The only candidate for the succession of the mayor Norbert Brugger, who has not been running for mayor for reasons of age, is the 46-year-old banker and businessman Dieter Köpfler from Löffingen.
The deadline for applications is Monday 11 November at 18.00.
Google, Samsung, Huawei sued for Nortel patents
The group, which owns thousands of Nortel's previous patents, filed an avalanche of patent infringement lawsuits against mobile phone manufacturers on Thursday, including Google, the company that was overthrown in the bankruptcy sale of Nortel.
Rockstar, the consortium that bought the Nortel patents for $4.5 billion, sued Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, HTC Corp, Huawei and four other companies for patent infringement in the U.S. District Court in Texas.
Rockstar is jointly owned by Apple, Microsoft, BlackBerry, Ericsson and Sony.
Google is charged with seven counts of patent infringement.
The patents are technology that brings search terms on the Internet into line with relevant advertising, the lawsuit says, which thus hits the core of Google's search engine business.
Representatives from Samsung, Huawei, HTC and Rockstar were not immediately available.
Samsung, Huawei and HTC are making phones that work with Google's Android operating system, which is in fierce competition with Apple and Microsoft's mobile products.
In 2011, Google made an initial bid of over $900 million for the Nortel patents.
Google has increased its offerings several times, most recently offering $4.4 billion.
After it was overbought on Rockstar's Nortel patents, Google acquired Motorola Mobility for $12.5 billion, a deal that was also partly motivated by Motorola's library of patents.
Although Google failed in its bid to acquire the patents at auction, Google has infringed the patents and continues to do so, according to the complaint.
Rockstar is seeking a high compensation from Google, as it claims that Google's patent infringement was intentional, the indictment said.
Egypt sworn in first freely elected presidents
Mohammed Morsi takes the oath of office, but his day of triumph is not expected to mark the end of the political strife in Egypt.
Islamist Mohammed Mursi promised a new Egypt when he was sworn in as the country's first freely elected president, succeeding Husni Mubarak, who had been ousted 16 months earlier.
With his inauguration before the Supreme Constitutional Court, Morsi also became the first freely elected Islamist president of the Arab world and Egypt's fifth head of state since the fall of the monarchy some 60 years ago.
He took the oath before the 18 judges of the court dressed in black robes, whose seat is on the Nile and which is modeled after an ancient Egyptian temple.
"We are striving for a better future, a new Egypt and a second republic", Morsi said at the ceremony, which was broadcast live on state television.
Today, the Egyptian people have laid the foundation for a new life  absolute freedom, true democracy and stability, said 60-year-old Morsi, a US-trained engineer and member of the Muslim Brotherhood, a fundamentalist group that has been heavily targeted by the respective government as a banned organisation since its founding 84 years ago.
Hundreds of soldiers and police were guarding the building when Morsi arrived in a small convoy shortly after 11 a.m. local time.
Only a few hundred supporters had gathered in front of the court to cheer for the new president, and unlike the presidential prank of Mubarak's time, traffic was stopped only briefly so that the convoy could cross the usually busy road that connects the city center with the southern suburbs.
As an uncharismatic "Replacement Wheel" of the Brotherhood, his personal prestige has increased since his victory and a Friday speech in which he presented himself not only as a candidate of the Islamists but all those who wanted to end the efforts of the 2011 uprising against authoritarian Mubarak.
"Egypt is now a civil, national, constitutional and modern state", Morsi, dressed in a blue suit and red tie, told the judges in the wooden tablets chamber where he took the oath.
Morsi later went to Cairo University, where he was to deliver his commencement address.
He was officially greeted by an army chapel playing the national anthem, which he listened to in a Habachtut position.
The military commander, Field Marshal Hussein Tantawi, was present.
On his arrival, he was greeted by hundreds of people in the university's largest auditorium with a speech by the army and the people.
Established in 1908 as a bastion of secular education, Cairo University has become a stronghold of Islamic student groups in the 1970s.
Morsi took a symbolic oath on Friday in Tahir Square, the birthplace of the uprising that ended Mubarak's authoritarian rule last year, and promised to reclaim presidential powers that the military council had taken from the deposed head of state.
But by taking the oath of office in court rather than in parliament as usual, he is bowing to the will of the military, which indicates that the power struggle will continue.
Mursi's speech in Tahir Square was filled with dramatic populist gestures.
Falkenberg's discotheque is making two great evenings.
The new season at the Falkenberg Blue Velvet discotheque has begun.
Friday night is "Pump this party", Saturday night is going on with a 25th party.
Fatty beats and cool sounds are promised by the organizers on both days.
Workers falling from the stairs: seriously injured
On Thursday, while replacing a defective external sensor, a 51-year-old worker in Eggelsberg fell from a ladder and was seriously injured.
The man from Lamprechthausen wanted to replace a defective heating sensor on the outside of a guesthouse.
As he climbed the stairs that led to the roof ditch, they slipped away and the man fell to the concrete floor.
He suffered serious injuries and was taken to the Salzburg State Hospital by helicopter.
Rapist in South Africa: twice life imprisonment
Nine months after the brutal rape and mutilature of a 17-year-old girl in South Africa, the perpetrator was sentenced to two life sentences on Friday.
This was reported by the SABC.
The victim later died from the consequences of the serious injuries.
John Cana had already been found guilty of the crime earlier this week.
The act had sparked nationwide horror.
The then 21-year-old raped Anene Booysen in February at an industrial site in Bredasdorp, near Cape Town.
For 14 hours, the doctors fought to save the victim, but to no avail.
The sight of the youths was so horrific that the nurses and nurses needed psychological help.
Kana admitted to being in a bar with booys the night of the trial.
He also admitted to beating and raping her, but denied being responsible for the girl's death.
The police initially believed that several perpetrators were involved, but they released two suspects from custody because the evidence against them was insufficient.
The prosecution also stressed during the proceedings that it was convinced that Kana was alone at the time of the attack.
Rape is almost a common occurrence in South Africa: about 64,000 sexual assault cases are reported each year.
This is almost ten times the number of people in Germany, which has a population of 82 million, but is much larger than South Africa (50 million).
But the police and women's organizations in South Africa estimate the number of sexual violence victims to be 10 to 25 times higher.
Jumbo visits the Black Forest with ham
Jumbo in search of the "best ham in the world": For the TV show "Galileo" the Pro7 star visited Bonndorf.
The speaker makes it clear from the outset that the pig's columns are the most important for ham, and turbomast is not a good condition.
So can ham that you get in every supermarket be a quality product?
As the head of Uli's large ham factory in the Black Forest, Jumbo explains how the Eagle company in Bonndorf operates.
"Germany's favorite ham", as Jumbo announces the Black Forest ham.
Only with hair protection and a coat can he get inside the factory.
Jumbo must disinfect his hands before he can touch the microphone.
Jumbo for strengthening in quick climbing in forestry
"I'm working on fatty quantities here", the TV makers wonder, "Black Forest ham as a mass product".
16,000 cloves a week speak for themselves.
Weight, fat, color: Uli explains what quality is all about.
Most pigs are slaughtered at six months.
Television with level?
Details like the pH of the meat also play a role.
The darker the meat, the higher the pH.
"I'm excited when you measure Roberto Blanco, what happens next", Jumbo said cynically.
This is a presentation of the level of private television in pure culture.
But it's still worth watching.
The viewer can see that the columns are still handmade.
Because Black Forest ham is traditionally found without bones on the shelf.
The secret to sinking is the salt mixing of spices.
Smoke tower and smoke-fighting visually remind Jumbo of a "submarine".
The trick: the pine branches here in the smoke provide the special taste of the Black Forest.
20 days in the smoke makes the ham almost black.
"Now the disk disappears in the Jumbo", he announces the test feed.
"This is really delicious", the TV star concluded.
It'll be a living for everyone involved.
You thought travel agencies were a thing of the past because of the Internet?
Flight Centre seems to be opposed to the trend.
The company has increased its profit outlook for the full year and expects record revenue from holidaymakers in Australia and the UK.
The travel company now assumes a net profit before tax of between $325 million and $340 million, compared with $305 million to $315 million in its previous forecast.
If the current targets are met, this represents a growth of 12 to 17 percent compared to the record profit of $290.4 million in 2011/12.
As CEO Graham Turner announced, Flight Centre made a profit of eight percent in the first half and posted a strong start to the second half, particularly in Australian and UK private business.
Since the beginning of the year, our ten countries have been profitable and some of them are well on track towards record year-on-year earnings before interest and tax, he explained.
These include Australia and the UK, which are typically among our strongest contributors.
In Australia, the leisure industry has recovered in the second half of the year, which has been likened to a slightly weaker business travel market.
Similarly, the leisure business of Flight Centre in the UK was doing well, while business customers spent less here.
US business has recovered from the seasonally weaker first half of the year, so a profit for the full year is expected for the third consecutive year.
Flight Centre's stock rose three cents yesterday to $38.20.
Schools are being encouraged to focus more on math, spelling and grammar
In English literature courses, students will now have to study at least one piece of Shakespeare, a 19th-century novel, romantic poetry and contemporary British novels from 1914.
The test also includes unseen texts to encourage wider reading.
The combined course in English literature and language is abolished.
From 2015 onwards, students will have to take a standalone GCSE language test, with strong incentives to choose English literature as a separate qualification.
The Ministry of Education will publish tomorrow the new curricula for English and mathematics  the first subjects to be radically redesigned.
Other core subjects will be changed next year.
In a separate initiative, Ofqual, the audit supervisor, will announce a reorganisation of the GCSE structures, including a new rating system and less coursework.
In a speech in the summer, Education Minister Michael Gove said there was a broad consensus that we need to reform our examination system to restore public confidence, stressing that GCSEs would become more challenging, ambitious and rigorous.
Studies show that English schools spend less time on maths  116 hours a year or three hours a week per school year  than in most other countries.
In contrast, Australian schools teach an average of 143 hours per year and students in Singapore receive 138 hours per year.
Although there will be no formal requirement to provide more time for mathematics in the curriculum, coalition circles say that the comprehensive math exam  combined with a stronger emphasis on the subject in rankings  will likely encourage schools to start more hours.
The curriculum will focus more on real-life problems, including financial mathematics.
Lovely animals and delicious cakes
The most beautiful rabbits of different breeds and colours will be presented at the Circuit Association performance show this weekend at the Burger House.
The evaluations were carried out on Thursday.
Once again, the W514 local association is hosting this major exhibition.
Breeders from the clubs in the Soest area show their best animals here as well as young Wickeder hobbyists show their rabbits.
On Thursday, six judges took the reviews of the numerous rabbits and were able to award outstanding animals.
Visitors to the exhibition are well informed, as all animals are assessed in cages.
The official opening of the exhibition will be held on Saturday at 14.30 by Mayor Hermann Arndt.
The rabbit show is open to all visitors on Saturday from 10 a.m. and Sunday from 10 a.m. to 3:30 p.m. followed by the award ceremony.
Guests are also invited to a lavishly-priced tombola and a deliciously-priced cafeteria.
Pamela Anderson is breaking away from her legendary blonde curls and performing for the first time with a new baby head.
Pamela's blonde curls have been famous since her role in the television series Baywatch.
Pamela Anderson is the latest star to shock her fans with a drastic new haircut.
The former Baywatch beauty has separated herself from her long blonde curls in favor of a platinum blonde short haircut.
The 46-year-old actress presented her latest look Wednesday in Los Angeles and posted a snapshot on her Twitter page.
It's the first time in 20 years that the blonde sex symbol has short hair, and we love the sedentary change.
What do you think of Pammy's hair?

The European Union has also been able to support the European Union's efforts to achieve a more sustainable and sustainable future.
The next World Forum on Monday, October 21, at the New Castle Museum will be on the theme "To Hell with Hell - Theological Reflections on Today's Dealings with the Last Things".
The speaker is Professor Johanna Rahner.
The Ecumenical Dialogue Forum is an initiative of the Catholic and Evangelical churches of Salem, Salem Castle and the Lake District Cultural Office.
Johanna Rahner wants to discuss in the forum how people today classify the "last things" after death.
If people had known too much about it in past centuries and had relied on the images of heaven and hell that "have shaped our imaginations to this day", contemporary prophetic teaching would be more likely to characterize the hopes of perfection by a certain confusion or even languagelessness.
"The greater hope has been duly dashed by Christian criticism of religion", says the speaker.
She "provided us with so many question marks that we seem to have lost the call signs".
Johanna Rahner continues: "But the ultimate challenge remains the annoyance of death".
This is linked to the desire to "dream that everything will be fine in the end".
Johanna Rahner, born 1962 in Baden-Baden, studied Catholic theology and biology at the Albert-Ludwigs University Freiburg from 1982 to 1989.
She obtained her doctorate in 1997 as a doctor of theology, also in Freiburg.
In 2003, he completed his habilitation in fundamental theology and ecumenical theology at the University of Westphalia.
Since 2010, Johanna Rahner has been a lecturer in systematic theology at the Institute of Catholic Theology at the University of Kassel.
Hostages: More than 100 young Catholics from Little Heuberg confirm their faith at confirmation
In two services, 101 15- and 16-year-old children in the mental health unit at Am Kleine Heuberg were diagnosed.
The morning service was accompanied by the group Laudato-Si, the afternoon by the youth choir The Spirit.
On receiving the sacrament of the company, the young ones said yes to their baptism and asked for the power of the Holy Spirit.
The company had been preparing for the great feast in recent months, under the direction of Deacon Reiner Dehner and with the help of numerous members of the congregation.
In different projects, they learned about different tasks of Christian community life and shared the experience of youth day in Untermachtal.
Illmensee: second mountain bike race enthusiastic participants
In splendid weather, 214 cyclists made their way to Illmensee to complete the round course over the hill-lines around the lake.
This is what Ulrich Knobel of the sports club Illmensee is telling us.
Among the participants, especially on the short distance of over 15 kilometres and 300 metres, were numerous cyclists who once wanted to practice their hobby in a competitive atmosphere.
Two junior drivers from the German top class also started the race: Felix Bader from Bad Waldsee and Pascal Treubel from Aach-Linz, who recommended good places in the German championships.
Both of these were able to get off the field as expected.
As in the previous year, Felix Bader managed to save a small lead in the final and defended his title as overall short distance winner.
Pascal Treubel was able to re-enter the second round.
For the ladies, it was Theresa Duelli of Team Nightmare who made it to the top of the winning ladder.
In second and third place were Anne Adel from Illmensee and Leonie Driver from Owingen.
A welcome development is the increasing number of drivers living or working in the community.
Not only was the performance of the sport represented, but the whole range of athletes.
The age structure also ranged from 10 years for the youngest to over 70 years for the oldest starters.
In the main race this year, there were even more absolute top athletes at the start.
Four drivers were able to pull off the regional top drivers.
Including Philipp Pangerl, a semi-pro mountain bike racer from the Black-Tusk Racing team.
Pangerl and a team mate have already won two world championships in the 12-hour race.
This year he became European champion in this special discipline.
Roland Ballerstedt, who has won two German titles in the duathlon, is also on the list.
After 45 kilometers and 900 meters of altitude, a lightning strike was reached in the target run outside the Three Lakes Hall.
Pangerl ran first across the finish line.
Only a second behind, the routine Ballerstedt managed to secure second place in the overall standings.
At the same time, Hermann and Warthmann were third in the overall standings.
In the women's race, Christiane Cohsmann was the fastest in the main race.
The second place was won by Areane Blersch from Binzwangen against Natasha Werner from Stuttgart.
Athletes and helpers were very satisfied with the smooth and well-organized running of the event.
Traveling through mud, rivers and jungles for free medical care
Dr. Georges Bwelle brings free medical care to remote villages in Cameroon
Bwelle and his team spend almost every weekend treating hundreds of patients
In this West African country, there are not many doctors, only one for every 5,000 people.
Listen here or on your mobile device
Dr. Georges Bwelle is one of the top 10 CNN Heroes of 2013.
You can vote for him or any of the other heroes in the top 10 to vote for him as CNN Hero of the Year.
The winner will receive $250,000 to continue his extraordinary work.
For 21 years, Georges Bwelle watched his sick father lose consciousness over and over again and travel to hospitals that did not have the means to help him.
Jamef Bwelle was injured in a car accident near Yaoundé, the capital of Cameroon, in 1981.
At first, he had only one broken arm, but then an inflammation developed that spread to his brain, causing a hematoma that would affect him for the rest of his life.
There were no neurosurgeons in Cameroon, according to Georges Bwelle.
We would have taken him out of Cameroon if we had the money.
Instead, Bwelle spent years escorting his father to crowded clinics and hospitals to get the treatment they had to offer.
"It's not easy", Bwelle says.
You can leave the house at five in the morning and run to the hospital to be the first, and you're not the first.
There are a lot of patients.
Some people even die because they have to wait.
The situation has hardly changed since Bwell's father died in 2002.
According to the World Health Organization, there is only one doctor for every 5,000 people in Cameroon.
In contrast, the ratio in the United States is one doctor for 413 people.
But even if a doctor were available, most Cameroonians could not afford to visit.
Two out of every five people in the country live below the poverty line, and nearly three quarters of the country's healthcare spending is private.
The only problem they have is poverty says Bwelle.
And poverty makes it impossible to enjoy life.
To see his father and so many of his countrymen suffered made Bwelle's decision to do something about it.
Dr. Georges Bwelle and his volunteer team performed 700 free surgeries last year.
He became a doctor himself and works as a vascular surgeon at the Central Hospital in Yaoundé.
He also founded a nonprofit organization called ASCOVIME, which travels to rural areas on weekends and provides free medical care.
Since 2008, he and his volunteer group have helped nearly 32,000 people.
Almost every Friday, he and up to 30 people force themselves into minibuses and drive over unpaved terrain with the medical equipment on the roof to the villages that need help.
It's not always going smoothly.
More than once they had to push the vehicles through rivers and mud.
But when they arrive, they will be greeted like heroes: a feast, song and dance and the best accommodation the place has to offer.
In these villages, free medical care is truly a reason to celebrate, and Bwelle  with his broad smile and boundless energy  is happy to be part of the joyful celebration.
The next morning, the team will begin examining hundreds of patients.
We treat 500 people per trip, says Bwelle.
They come from a radius of 60 kilometers around the village and walk.
Each of these weekend clinics offers medical care in a number of areas.
Many people are being treated for malaria, tuberculosis, malnutrition, diabetes, parasites and sexually transmitted diseases.
Others receive crutches, donated glasses or free birth certificates  a document that is required for school, but many poor families simply cannot afford it.
In the evening, the team performs simple operations with local anesthesia.
Surgeries usually take place in a school, town hall, or apartment; after the procedure, patients get up and go to the restroom to make room for the next person.
The lighting for the O.R. and disinfecting equipment is powered by the group's generator, and Bwelle and his volunteers work until the early hours of Sunday morning.
It's a strenuous pencil, but the village musicians usually help keep the team motivated.
"They're drummering all night so we can stay awake and keep working", says Bwelle.
On Sunday, the team will return to the city, tired but proud of the work they have done.
The group  a mix of Cameroonian doctors and foreign medical students  has performed 700 free surgeries in the past year and knows that their work makes a huge difference to the people they help.
One man explained that the free surgery on a fracture he received now allows him to work again.
"It changes the future of my family", the man said.
In addition to his weekend clinics and his work as a hospital surgeon, Bwelle also works at night in private clinics in Yaoundé.
With this second job, Bwelle says, he finances 60% of his nonprofit work, the rest coming from private donations.
"I really don't know when he's sleeping", says Katie O'Malley, a second-year medical student at Drexel University in Philadelphia who volunteers with Bwell's group.
He's either in the hospital all the time or trying to raise money for the organization so he can go to these campaigns.
For medical and nursing students like O'Malley, who come from the US and Europe and support Bwelle, this is an opportunity to gain practical experience that they would never get at home.
"We can be in the operating room helping to pump blood or holding the instruments for Dr. Bwelle", explains O'Malley.
That would never be possible in America as a second-year medical student.
Students usually pay for their travel to Cameroon themselves and often bring donated medical supplies.
But once they are in Yaoundé, Bwelle takes over the accommodation, transportation and guidance.
"He is a hero, no doubt", says O'Malley.
He has dedicated his life to this organization and his desire to help the people of Cameroon knows no bounds.
For Bwelle, working almost constantly is no burden.
He finds great joy in helping others to live happier lives and thereby fulfill a promise he made to his Father.
"I'm so happy doing this job", Bwelle says.
And I think about my father.
I hope he sees what I'm doing.
I do it to make people laugh again and to ease the pain.

Excellent in the fight
The role of Santiago, the old man in Hemingway's novel The Old Man and the Sea, is cut off by Horst Janson.
Janson himself is an old rabbit in his craft, theater.
No one can hurt old Santiago when he's fishing.
It's just how great they complement each other.
You almost seem to be able to see the wrinkles on the old man's neck that the fisherman Manolo talks about.
When Santiago is tired of life, sitting on the chair bent over, it's real with Janson.
And the role of the old fisherman is a character role that Janson excels at.
Hemingway told the story of a fighter, a brave man who never gave up and ultimately, through his knowledge and willpower, won the battle against the fish.
Janson has been a solo performer on stage for many years.
He manages to focus the audience's attention on himself so that his monologues are not boring for a moment.
His efforts to finally draw the fish to the surface of the water are so real that the viewers forget that the sea is made up of blue-lit water bottles.
Director Jens Hasselmann has the old man in the boat outside the fishing village.
During the performance, he brings to light the active scene: the Santiago hut, the bar of singer Marie-Luise Gunst, who sings with her songs and her glorious voice the feeling of life in Cuba.
The four musicians play Cuba's rhythm and are guests at the bar.
Tourism: descending to the Romans
At about 120 metres (120 feet) below Cologne, a Roman-era sewage channel is preserved.
Anyone who visits Cologne does not pass the cathedral.
The two towers rise to a height of about 150 feet [157 m] and make it the second tallest church building in Europe.
But few visitors who marvel at the two filigree towers of the church realize that there is much to discover beneath the cathedral.
Rainer Schulze is an expert on the Cologne underworld.
The meeting point for his guides is the service centre of Cologne Tourism directly at the cathedral.
The tour begins quite spectacularly: "We start in the underground garage", says Schulze.
In the 1970s, the city fathers wanted a self-sustaining city, and so only what was not too large remained of the remains of the old city wall.
Most people who use the car park also pass by the remains of the Roman city and park their cars.
But if you look closely, you'll find an archaeological site separated by metal bars on the D2 deck.
There are ruins of about five metres high made of handmaid-sized stones.
"They are the remains of the Roman city wall, built in the second half of the first century C.E"., Schulze says.
Before returning to daylight, Schulze takes the participants on the upper parking lot and takes a look at a dark, 15 meter deep shaft.
This is the fountain of the old dome, which unfortunately is hardly noticed.
The next stop of the tour is the Praetorium, and here the participants climb back down into the depths.
We're witnessing the office of the once most powerful man north of the Alps, the CCAA's president.
What CCAA means, a visitor wants to know.
"The abbreviation stands for "Colonia Claudia Ara Agrippinensium", which in German means as much as "City of Roman Law and City of the Agrippines, founded under Emperor Claudius at the site of the altar for the cult of the emperor".
And the Praetorium is the former Governor's Palace, the center of power of the Roman Empire on the Rhine.
From the exhibition premises, a tunnel leads to the Roman sewerage canal, which is preserved here at about 120 meters in length.
"You can walk a bit along the so-called Cloaca Maxima if you want", Schulze cheers the guests up.
There's a surprise left for school.
After he gets the key from the safe, he leads the group to a 16-meter-deep, walkable shaft.
"We are now in the mikveh, a ritual Jewish bath", he explains.
The Jewish community built their bath deep into the ground to access the groundwater, which was essential for ritual washing.
To this day, the lower end of the Mikve, whose origins date back to the eighth century, can be seen to be the source of water levels of the Rhine River.
The Mikve will be part of an archaeological zone on the town hall square, for which construction work is due to begin soon.
But it will take some years to complete.
Leg almost cut off: Re-edition of rocker process
A bloody attack in the rocker world is being rolled out again after over four years.
A trial for attempted murder, dangerous bodily harm and property damage against two 30-year-olds has begun in Frankfurt (Oder) district court.
He is accompanied by strict security measures.
The defendants are silent about the opening.
I'm told you were active in the rock scene and were one of the bandits back then.
The prosecution accuses them of stabbing and beating three men in a car in Finowfurt in June 2009 together with unknown accomplices.
All the victims were seriously injured, one man almost lost his leg.
The victims were said to have been part of Hell's Angels' competing group.
One of them was a high-ranking member from Berlin.
Apparently, a chase with several cars was underway.
The charges were a series of police clashes and a power demonstration.
The two defendants were acquitted in a first trial in early 2012.
A court spokesman said at the time that it could not be proven that the men were actually involved in the bloody feud.
The perpetrators were wearing masks and had not been identified.
The Federal Court of Justice reversed the judgment after the public prosecutor's office had reviewed it and referred it back to the Landgericht for further hearing.
One of the accused is currently on open trial for another crime.
The first was the reconstruction of the night's operations.
The Commissioner who was investigating at the time was called as a witness.
The center was made up of cell phone calls from the accused and other people who had been tapped by the police.
It's hard for rockers in court to almost always abide by a law they've been told to uphold - and not testify.
The same goes for the victims.
At the first trial, only one of the victims had unpacked.
Prosecutor Stefan Golfier of the Frankfurt public prosecutor's office (Oder) said on request that new evidence had emerged since the last trial.
The trial is scheduled for 11 more days.
The disposable society does not think
The night was long, the music was loud and the mood was good, but eventually it's home.
It's just that the belly of the people in the passenger and the back seat makes the hunger noticeable.
Of course, it could be some cocktail or sect.
What's closer than being chill to the next drive-in to indulge in a little something?
I admit, I'm happy to be there when it's late at night or early in the morning at the fast food pantry.
A couple of potatoes, a Coke, a burger, and then nothing like going home and to bed!
But on the way home, the obvious differences between me and other hungry disco goers are noticeable.
Why, then, should you be constantly throwing your fast food bags out of the car window?
Especially on weekends, discarded paper bags are found on roadsides and in parking lots.
"Why?" I ask myself.
Are people too stupid to take the bags home to the next dumpster?
It's not just that paperwork is messing with the landscape.
Bags have also covered transportation facilities such as control boards, causing accidents.
But she doesn't think about what the "Wheels" company said, and she probably doesn't even know what that word actually means.
If you're on the road more often at night, especially with several people in the car, you know what a backseat can look like after a night out: clothes, bottles, and other garbage are crammed in.
A few bags would be more or less nothing, unlike on the street where no one wants to trample on the food left over.
I see the day coming when cities and towns will be too stupid to leave their way, and fast food chains will have to pledge their bags.
Obama's withdrawal from health policy
After fierce criticism, President Obama backed down yesterday with his often repeated, clear promise: If you like your health insurance, you can keep it.
After hundreds of thousands of people received a letter of resignation from their insurer, Republicans have accused the president of deceiving the American public in recent days.
Yesterday, Obama relativized his original promise.
The vast majority of citizens who have a working health insurance can keep it, he said in a speech in Boston.
In response to the numerous media reports of the announcements, Obama urged those Americans who received such communications to look for new insurance on the open market.
Most citizens could thus get better, more comprehensive health insurance at the same price or lower than forecast.
"You're getting a better offer", he said.
The government said it was little surprising that the five percent of the population who had taken out insurance themselves would have to look for a different rate, as their contract did not meet the new standards under the Affordable Care Act.
I want to say to these Americans quite directly: they deserve better, said Sebelius in a hearing before the House Energy and Commerce Committee in Washington.
Sebelius, who is responsible for implementing the Affordable Care Act, said the online platform had been "miserable" since October.
"I'm as frustrated and angry as anyone else", she said.
I'm determined to regain your trust.
This statement by a frustrated Sebelius to a counselor sitting behind her at the House hearing yesterday was taken after a debate with Republican Congressman Billy Long of Missouri about whether she should be required to participate in Obamacare.
After more than three hours of hearing, Long Sebelius repeatedly asked why the architect of the Affordable Care Act did not voluntarily waive state-sponsored insurance to sign a healthcare.gov tariff that she now wants to sell to millions of Americans.
Government in Jerusalem confirms attack on Syrian air base not
An American government official who wanted to remain anonymous told CNN on Thursday that Israeli warplanes had attacked an air base in Latakia, Syria, a day earlier.
The target was "missiles and related equipment" that the Israeli government feared were intended for the Lebanese Hezbollah, CNN reported.
Syrian and Lebanese media and the Arab channel Al-Arabiya had previously reported that the base in the port city of Latakia was shot down on Wednesday to Thursday night, blaming the Israelis.
Israeli TV channel Channel 2 showed satellite images of the base in Latakia showing Russian S-125 Newa defense missiles and a battery of SA-3 missiles, which Channel 2 says have a range of 35 kilometers and can carry warheads up to 70 kilograms.
The uncertain government in Jerusalem has not officially confirmed the attack.
However, Reuters quoted an Israeli government official who was also anonymous as saying he believed Israel carried out the attack but was not sure.
A spokesman for the Israeli Defense Ministry said: "We do not comment on these reports".
Journalist Ron Ben-Yishai stressed in the daily Yedioth Ahronoth that the Syrian regime had previously tried, with some success, to deliver ground-to-air missiles to Hezbollah.
The Israeli government had repeatedly warned that any Syrian attempt to supply Hezbollah with chemical or other dangerous weapons would mean crossing a "red line" followed by a military response.
John Kerry has made an unprecedented confession that US espionage has gone too far.
John Kerry, with an unexpected admission, indicated a shift in the US's defensive stance on its surveillance programmes, saying that in certain cases espionage had gone too far.
The Secretary of State also admitted that he and Barack Obama were responsible for switching to autopilot when the explosive revelations by whistleblower Edward Snowden about NSA espionage activities were made public.
The leaked information has led the US government into a diplomatic storm of outrage from its allies.
In a video address at the Open Government Conference in London, Kerry said: "There is no doubt that the President and I, as well as others in the government, have learned some things that have been done almost autonomously simply because the ability to do so dates back to World War II and the difficult years of the Cold War and, of course, to September 11".
He was the first senior member of the US government to admit that US espionage had crossed a line, but he also stressed that no rights had been abused.
He said, "In some cases, this has gone too far".
The President is determined to bring clarity, and therefore is conducting a thorough investigation so that no one should feel that abuse is taking place here.
I assure you that the rights of innocent people will not be violated in this trial.
Kerry, however, insisted that the NSA was a force for good and that its surveillance had saved many lives.
He added: We are dealing with a new world where people are ready to blow themselves up.
There is a radical extremism in the world that is obsessed with killing people, blowing up and attacking governments.
So what if we could catch and stop it before it happens?
We have actually prevented plane crashes, attacks on buildings and the killing of people because we have been informed in advance of such plans.
Meanwhile, U.S. lawmakers will travel to Europe to dispel concerns about alleged American espionage and convince Europeans of the need to continue to work with the United States in counterterrorism efforts, the chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on European Affairs said on Thursday.
Senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut said he spoke with representatives of the European Parliament and others this week and was concerned about their threats to stop participating in anti-terrorism organizations because of frustration over surveillance by the National Security Agency.
It is very important for the national security interests of the United States that Europeans remain on board in view of our joint efforts to combat terrorism, Murphy, who is a Democrat serving in the Senate for the first time and is chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on Foreign Relations and European Affairs, said in an interview in Washington.
I'm also going to Europe to make it clear that we need to continue to work together in the fight against terrorism, despite their anger over the NSA programs.
Media reports that the NSA has captured millions of phone records in Europe have strained relations with some US allies, although the head of the intelligence service this week declared the reports to be inaccurate and based on a misunderstanding of the metadata collected by NATO allies and exchanged with the United States.
Other revelations cited documents provided by Snowden that the NSA had been monitoring the cell phone of Chancellor Angela Merkel and up to 34 other heads of state around the world.
The head of the national intelligence services, James Clapper, defended the espionage of allies as necessary and stated that this was common practice on both sides.
In all the tumult, Murphy said his agency was preparing for the congressional trip to be held this year, and hoped the delegation would include members from both parties and chambers.
The names of the other Members of Parliament who will be taking part in the debate will be published in the coming days.
He said the exact route was still being worked out.
While Murphy stressed that the purpose of the trip was to improve relationships, he also spoke of some "serious words" coming.
He said European governments should be honest with their people about the kind of espionage programs they themselves have been using for years.
Although we can change our surveillance programmes to better protect the rights of Europeans, they must also be compatible with the fact that we are not the only ones spying, Murphy said.
Meanwhile, John Kerry is due to travel to the Middle East and Poland over the weekend to discuss the resentment of the US strategy in Syria, Egypt and Iran and US surveillance activities.

Australian woman appeals against prison sentence in Thailand
A 21-year-old Sydney woman who was sentenced to 15 days in prison in Phuket for falsely claiming to have been raped by a taxi driver has appealed the verdict and was released on bail.
Stevie Rochelle Bamford was initially found guilty by a provincial court in Phuket on June 15 of making a false statement after she told Thai police that a local taxi driver raped her in the early hours of Sunday, June 10, while two other men detained her.
However, later video footage showed that she had securely entered her hotel after being separated from her Australian boyfriend.
The Phuket police interrogated Bamford for two days until she admitted to making up the story.
Until the trial, she was in police custody.
Bamford was sentenced to 15 days in a low-security prison on the outskirts of Phuket instead of being sentenced to a prison for adult women.
She is the daughter of Peter Tunks, a former Australian rugby league player who has asked the Foreign Office in Canberra for help for his daughter.
Tunks told the Sunday Telegraph in Sydney that the whole family were "extremely concerned" about his daughter's well-being and wanted her back in Australia.
"We are very worried, of course, but we hope she will be home as soon as possible", Tunks said.
Bamford has appealed the verdict and is free to bail out 50,000 baht.
Australian reports said she was on holiday in the southern Thai resort of Krabi.
The court heard that Bamford was represented by a local lawyer in Phuket and warned that the appeal could also lead to a higher sentence of up to two years in an adult prison.
However, it is also possible that Thailand may have been trying to improve its tourist image after the recent murder of travel agent Michelle Smith in Phuket, and therefore is being discharged.
