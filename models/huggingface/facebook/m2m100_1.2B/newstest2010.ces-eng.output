Barack Obama is the fourth American president to receive the Nobel Peace Prize.
U.S. President Barack Obama will fly to Oslo for 26 hours to receive the Nobel Peace Prize as the fourth U.S. president.
He will receive a diploma, a medal and a $1.4 million check for his exceptional efforts to strengthen world diplomacy and cooperation among nations.
The head of the White House will arrive in the Norwegian capital in the morning with his wife Michelle and will be busy.
He first visited the Nobel Prize Institute, where he met for the first time with five members of the committee, which selected him in October from 172 people and 33 organizations.
The presidential couple then had a scheduled meeting with Norwegian King Harald V and Queen Sonja.
In the afternoon, the visit will culminate in a ceremony at which Obama will take over the prestigious awards.
He will be the fourth President of the United States, but only the third to win the prize in office.
The White House has already announced that Obama will talk about the war in Afghanistan.
The president does not want to avoid this topic because he realizes that he is taking the prize as a president who is currently at war in two countries.
The war effort a few days ago even increased by sending additional troops to Afghanistan, which no one of its critics will forget to emphasize.
At the ceremony, Obama will also receive a gold medal, a diploma and a check worth ten million Swedish kronor (about 24 million Czech kronor).
He is planning to give it to charity, but has not yet decided on a specific charity.
The president will be invited to a banquet with the Norwegian King and Queen as well as the Prime Minister and 250 other guests.
Obama has been more restrained from the beginning.
He said he felt he didn’t deserve it entirely.
He also repeated several times that the prize is not just for him, but for everyone who strives for the same values as him.
Immediately after the announcement, he said it was a "call to action" for him.
Conservative accused of blackmail
Litoměřic police accused the chairman of the civil association Society of nature protectors Litoměřice of blackmail.
In several cases in the past year he appealed to some construction proceedings, for the withdrawal of the appeal demanded from investors money for his benefit, said litoměřica police spokeswoman Alena Romová.
The chairman of the Society of Conservatives of Nature is Lubomír Studnička.
He is now in custody and faces up to three years in prison.
Containers do not smell badly.
In Prague, ordinary people can sort the packaging of drinks, in the South Moravian villages you will meet the sorting containers at every step.
And in Brunei?
There to reserve a few minutes before you find a suitable garbage.
I am not saying that there is no waste at all.
But I find that because we are the second largest city in the republic, the council is not interested in this problem enough.
Brno is in the forest league of sorting waste not only by the fact that as citizens here we can still throw only paper, glass and plastics into sorting containers, but above all by the number of garbage stalls for such waste.
Have you ever tried to throw PET bottles into a collector’s basket?
It’s a ready-made stitch, especially it takes time and strong nerves.
The only place I’ve seen so far is in the Moravian Square, opposite Potrefené Huse.
I don’t want to be angry with my colleagues, but it’s not too much for me.
Not to mention the fact that there is no honey in the sorting of waste in other parts.
A lot of people prefer not to waste.
of laziness.
They are far from dirt.
I am not surprised by them.
After the party, I offered to throw out a couple of glass and plastic bottles.
But I did not see any coloured dirt on Kounic’s street.
Fortunately, I came to the right place on the way to the shell.
But the garbage has gone out of it.
It’s probably the city center of Brunei, which is probably the most representative of the city, right?
But ecology and some aesthetics probably don’t care much about Brunei Socialists.
Those in the city would rather buy a hockey extra league, which would make us ashamed throughout the republic, than to buy a few containers more and offer the sorting of other raw materials for a cleaner Brno.
I am pleased that I was able to confirm my assumption after a moment of browsing the internet with official statistics.
According to data from EKO-KOM, Brno is really the worst in the whole South Moravia region.
Paroubkov’s budget took money for pensions and sickness
After the left added despite the government’s opinion to farmers or officials, there may not be money in the budget for pensions, sickness or construction savings.
But also for interest on state debt or international litigation.
It will cause problems to those who will rule in the second half of next year, Finance Minister Eduard Janota said.
When the Social Democrats and Communists pushed for increases to some groups, they relied on the sensitive spending, pensions, or sickness, the government would lend in addition. "It's just postponing problems for the future, putting mines," says Janota.
Interest on borrowed money is increasing and sometimes it must be returned.
The state has no power to choose where to go.
If they do not reduce social benefits or the cost of running the state, they must raise taxes.
To all who are now added by the left: firefighters, teachers, farmers.
and later their children.
In the case of pensions or sickness, the account of which has disappeared 1.8 billion, people do not have to worry, they will get them.
However, at the cost of increasing the state’s debt – next year it will not be missing only 163 billion, but more.
Despite the efforts of Minister Janoty, the debt will grow more and more rapidly and with it the cost of interest.
The state will need money to pay for it and it will no longer be enough to slightly raise VAT or reduce maternity, as the government did in its anti-deficit package.
Due to the transfers of money in favor of several groups of voters, next year there will also be a lack of five billion for the reconstruction of highways and railways.
It is mostly about already competed and built-up sections, which can not be re-projected and possibly lowered.
The most important thing is to conserve, which is not free.
This means delaying or stopping thirty large buildings, as well as threatening the pumping of European money, said Karel Hanzelka, a spokesman for the Ministry of Transport.
ČSSD has proposed that the loss of money will be solved salomonically – it will reach the dividends of the ČEZ, which the state owns by the majority, and will be assigned to the transport fund.
The problem is that the amount of the dividend is never certain, and it is no longer an endless resource.
Last year, the budget reached $18 billion.
Each year, the dividend is paid for the liquidation of environmental damage, supplemented with a pension account or serves as a reserve for the upcoming pension reform.
In addition, under EU rules, this trick increases the actual budget deficit to 5.7% of GDP.
But this is not the end of the transfer carnival.
Nearly three billion dollars were lost in the budget for various compensations to the victims of communism and crimes, or for the costs of legal proceedings, even for construction savings.
Whether the country will survive without that money is uncertain.
This is lottery.
If we lose any international dispute, we will have to pay the same, says Janota.
The minister will then have to save money inside the department or, in the worst case, use the government budget reserve.
One hundred million is also missing for the two-billion-dollar State Treasury project, which is to allow online monitoring of what the individual authorities spend.
The first phase starts in January.
If the finance minister did not find money elsewhere, the project would have to stop, sanctions would come, Janota warns.
Your next smartphone will run two operating systems
In the future, Americans are counting on a mobile phone on which users will switch between different operating systems by pressing a single button.
The revealed plans sound promising.
Just press one key and move from Windows Mobile to Android in a matter of seconds.
This is exactly what the American company VMware is aiming for, which is mainly focused on the development of computer virtualization software.
We will allow you to maintain two user profiles on your mobile at the same time.
You can switch between them, you can divide them into home and work.
Both will work at the same time, said Srinivas Krishnamurti of VMware in an interview with Computerworld.
It was presented in November last year and was first shown a few days ago.
It will be on the market in 2012.
Virtualization of smart phones is no fiction.
VMware has already successfully presented to journalists a test sample of a smartphone with two operating systems.
It was a modified Nokia N800 with 128 MB of RAM, which ran alongside the aforementioned Windows Mobile and Android systems.
The development of new technology for mobile phones is in full swing.
VMware is now working with European and U.S. operators to test smartphone virtualization, and customers are expected to get the devices in 2012.
Lack of snow in the mountains
Hollow slopes are not only concerned with Krkonošskiy lifters.
The lack of snow also discourages people from ordering skiing stays in hotels and pensions.
Therefore, there are still free rooms available for all winter dates, including Christmas and New Year’s Eve.
Visitors to our website are huge.
People go through offers, find out prices, but for now they are afraid to bind orders.
And if they call us, they immediately ask if we think this year’s Christmas will be on snow or mud,” said Martin Jandura, the operator of the Spindl.Info news portal.
Anyone who wants a new year's stay in Špindlerovo Mlýno exactly according to their wishes should not hesitate with the order.
Anyone who prefers to save money and the quality of accommodation is in his second place, he can still try a few days to wait.
Spindler hotels offer only weekly stays on New Year’s Eve.
I think they will try to get married for a while, but then they will allow and go for a shorter time.
And then the free rooms will rapidly decrease,” Jandura estimated.
Free beds in all winter dates are still offered by the top-Lab travel agency Ingtours.
This is the Christmas season, which has not yet been sold out.
Half of the seats are still free.
Therefore, we have already prepared some cheaper Christmas stays at the last minute,” said Ingtoursu Director Petr Schiefert.
New Year’s Eve in Krkonoše can also be offered by the Vrchlabska travel agency, but there are fewer vacancies.
The first fourteen days of February go well on sale, the remaining winter dates are sold on average.
This year’s interest in winter stays is negatively affected by the fact that there is still no snow in Krkonoše.
People are waiting for him to attack.
No one wants to spend the end of the year in the mountains without snow.
If the slopes are snowed during the week, Christmas will also be sold out,” Schiefert said.
In contrast, it is a little better than last year to occupy the rooms of the Hotel Horizont in Peci pod Sněžkou.
We are about 5 percent better.
On Christmas and New Year’s Eve we have the last few seats.
There is great interest in Polish holidays in January and February is selling well,” said the director of the best hotel in Beijing, Karel Rada.
Of the eighty percent, the hotel Omnia at the central parking lot in Janských Lázních is also occupied for the New Year’s Eve.
On the other hand, half of the beds are still free in the newest Janskolázeň hotel.
This year, we were pleasantly surprised by January, which is already occupied by about sixty percent.
A little weaker for the time being is February, but as soon as the snow comes, interest in stays in Krkonoše will definitely rise, said Omnia hotel director Erik Sporysch.
However, for more snow, hotel owners have to let go of the taste.
It is expected to cool on Thursday, so if there are any rainfall, there should be snow in the mountains.
But then the warming will come again, Jiří Jakubský from the castle workplace of the Czech Hydrometeorological Institute said.
Repetition is the Mother of Wisdom
It is comic with what schoolwork Barack Obama, the president with the reputation of being the smartest, repeats in the Afghan question the strategy of his predecessor, whom he considered the most stupid.
When he finally swallowed out his long-awaited Afghan doctrine, it turned out that he described it through a copier from Bush’s Iraqi script three years ago.
Not only did he use the phrase "as in Iraq" several times in the text itself, but he did not hesitate to even use the title of the January 2007 Bush Statement as the title of his own declaration: "A New Way Forward."
Three years ago, he criticized Bush’s idea of sending fresh military reinforcements to Iraq, plagued by the civil war, as a “irresponsible and in its consequences catastrophic decision.”
But the months that followed showed that Bush’s strategy based on recommendations from field commanders was the only one that was possible and so successful that there is no mention of Iraq in the news reports today.
This did not improve Bush’s reputation, but objectively left his successor with a much more grateful starting position than could be expected.
In Afghanistan, Barack Obama hopes the miracle will happen again.
The increase of the military contingent was again requested by field commanders, notably the chief of the Afghan operation, General Stanley McCristal, who, despite his subordinate practices, even harshly criticized the hesitant shooters in the White House.
He asked for 40,000 men to break the situation to the better.
The president hesitated for three months, but he did not find anything better, and so at least deceived the general with 10 thousand soldiers.
From Europe, he was able to sweep out the promise of another 5 thousand, although he himself initially counted at least 10 thousand.
The most problematic of Obama’s strategy seems to be his intention to start withdrawing troops from Afghanistan in 18 months and to end this process in three years.
Many have doubts that the half-increase will yield the same fruits as the progress in Iraq.
Despite the brotherly wars of recent years, Iraqi society is relatively well-organized, its leaders honour agreements.
The situation in Afghanistan is characterized by the opposite symptom - no one can be trusted and no agreements are observed.
Badly prepared in these circumstances, the Afghan security forces are used to changing masters every day as they like.
Political institutions, even if they are formally established, will remain only a village behind which patriarchal tribal relations will continue to flourish.
Balancing the interests of different ethnic groups is extremely difficult given the vague situation, which further complicates Pakistani and Iranian influences.
Even the construction of a “accessible state”, which is the minimalist goal of the entire operation, does not seem too realistic.
The time horizon of Obama’s strategy is striking with its voluntarism.
In the past eight years, the situation in Afghanistan has only worsened and is now on the verge of an explosion.
To believe that the soldiers sent to the war wreck for the purpose of "short return home" will cause the miracle done here, can only the soul truly romantic, untouched by reality.
From a political point of view, setting a date for the withdrawal of troops is pure irresponsibility, as the Taliban will perceive it as an indirect acknowledgment of the American defeat.
The last NATO summit showed that the willingness of Europeans to participate in combat operations in Afghanistan is down to minus.
European politicians cannot and do not want to explain to their voters how the security of Germany or Italy is related to the war in the Hindu Mountains.
Another factor capable of radically affecting the situation is the developments around Iran.
If the situation continues to deteriorate and the heightened sanctions on Iran fail, the U.S. will face the overwhelming question of whether to try to solve the problem by military force.
It will need to be answered at a time when, according to Obama, America will step towards a victorious withdrawal from Afghanistan.
Any such solution, however, will also mean a dramatic turn in the Afghan situation.
The only patch for Barack Obama is the fact that there are three years to the presidential election, and therefore there is still enough time to come up with another strategy if it turns out to be a total downfall.
Goldman Sachs managers will no longer receive cash rewards
Senior executives at Goldman Sachs won’t receive cash pay this year.
This was announced by the company, which responded to sharp criticism of its wage practices.
A group of 30 top managers will receive shares instead of money, which can be sold no earlier than in five years.
In addition, shares can be removed from managers if they take excessive risks.
Goldman Sachs, according to Reuters, is leading efforts to link rewards on Wall Street with long-term performance.
I think Wall Street is well aware of the wider direction it needs to go, said former JPMorgan investment banker Douglas Elliott.
The problem is in the details, he added.
Goldman Sachs became the target of criticism after giving up almost $17 billion in remuneration for the first three quarters of this year.
According to Reuters, the company’s total remuneration this year is likely to exceed $20 billion despite today’s announcement.
With the emergence of the financial crisis, high salaries in the banking sector have become a hot topic in a number of countries.
Britain on Wednesday announced that it intends to impose a one-time tax of 50 percent on bankers’ bonuses exceeding £25,000.
France is taking similar measures.
This year, women won the Nobel Prize in all subjects except physics.
A record five women received this year’s Nobel Prize in Literature and Sciences from King Carl XVI Gustaf of Sweden.
Among them was the German writer Herta Müller.
The Nobel Prize in Medicine was awarded to two American biologists, Elizabeth Blackburn and Carol Greider, along with Jack Szostak, for their research on chromosomes.
The Nobel Prize in Chemistry was awarded to Israeli physicist Ada Jonath, along with Americans Venkatraman Ramakrishnan and Thomas Steitz for their work on the structure and function of ribosomes.
The Nobel Prize in Economics was awarded to American economist Elinor Ostrom and her fellow economist Oliver Williamson for their analysis of economic governance.
The only professional category that went without a holder this year was Physics.
The prize was awarded to scientists Charles Kao for their research in the field of fiber optics and George Smith and Willard Boyle for the invention of the CCD chip, which is the foundation of all digital cameras, faxes and astronomical telescopes.
Each recipient received a diploma, a Nobel medal and a certificate of earning a financial reward.
The total amount for each category amounts to 10 million Swedish kronor (approximately SEK 25 million).
If there are more than one of them, the reward is divided between them.
The long-awaited Nobel Peace Prize was presented to U.S. President Barack Obama in Oslo, Norway.
In his speech, he acknowledged the controversiality of his award, as he is only at the beginning of his career and, in addition, he is at the forefront of a country that is waging two wars - in Iraq and Afghanistan.
In defense of his policy, however, he added that wars are necessary in certain situations for the achievement of peace, even though the price for it is high.
Minister Janota considers resignation, Klaus invites him to the castle
President Václav Klaus will receive Finance Minister Eduard Janot on Friday morning, who is considering staying in the government because he does not agree with the shape of the state budget for next year, as approved by the House of Representatives on Wednesday.
It is expected that the budget and maybe even Janot’s stay in the cabinet will be the topics of their Friday meeting.
The bill is also criticized.
The deficit is too high, which further aggravates the financial crisis.
About the meeting informed the President’s spokesman Radim Ochvat.
Janota is scheduled to meet with Prime Minister Jan Fischer on Monday.
According to the bill on the budget, which now gets Klaus to sign, the Czech Republic should manage with a deficit of SEK 163 billion.
On Wednesday, the House of Representatives approved proposals for money transfers and increased funds for the salaries of state employees, the operation of social services and direct payments to farmers.
The government blamed social democracy’s proposals for hiddenly increasing the budget deficit.
Between the left on the one hand and the government, Klaus and the right on the other, a sharp internal political dispute has arisen because of which the question begins to float over the further action of Fischer's official cabinet, the formation of which was agreed in spring by ODS, ČSSD and the Party of the Greens.
Critics argue that the budget, as adopted by the House, essentially liquidates the austerity package that Fischer’s government imposed in the autumn, which she says is aimed at stopping the debt of the state.
Klaus, who can, but also does not have to sign the state budget law, at today’s discussion breakfast with entrepreneurs, said that politicians have for a long time neglected a “serious problem”, which is the “unsustainable deficit” of public finances.
Today, he no longer has a good solution.
Improvements could only be achieved by a strong government, which could rely on a broader consensus among political parties, the president said.
ODS Chairman Mirek Topolánek said the budget is terrifying and the government should consider further existence.
Deputy Chairman of the ODS Petr Nečas told ČTK that the concept of an official cabinet with the support of ČSSD, ODS and the Greens no longer works.
Prime Minister Fischer described such words as “strong statements”.
The head of ČSSD Jiří Paroubek reacted to Topolánka with the words that the budget deficit, which the former Topolánkov government prepared for this year and which will exceed 200 billion CZK, is terrifying.
On Wednesday, the government approved the next year’s budget as a success.
The people were also satisfied.
Morgan Freeman plays Clint Eastwood.
South Africans say the new Hollywood film Invictus: Unbeaten will tell the world a lot about the country, its struggles and victories despite some criticism that the main roles are played by American actors.
The story tells about sports, racial relationships and Nelson Mandela.
A tireless fighter against the racist apartheid regime in South Africa and its first black president, Nelson Mandela, is represented in his life story by Oscar-winning American actor Morgan Freeman.
Freeman said that Nelson Mandela asked him if he could play him in Eastwood's film.
Another important role is played by Matt Damon.
I told him, ‘When I play you, I’ll have access to you.
The seventy-two-year-old actor, who won the award for his role in Eastwood’s boxing drama Million Dollar Baby, has already played the leader of the slave abolition movement, who eventually became a slave, a fictional president of the United States and even a god in Divine Evan, but only rarely someone who is still alive and as important to many people as Mandela.
The former South African statesman was jailed for 27 years for his active work to end apartheid in South Africa.
He was released from prison in 1990 and became president for four years.
In 1993 he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.
Invictus is a Latin word for the unbeaten and is the title of a poem by English author William Ernest Henley published in 1875.
The challenge was to talk like him.
The film is a true story of how Nelson Mandela joined forces with South African rugby team captain Francois Pienaar to help unite the country.The newly elected President Mandela knows that his nation remains still racially and economically divided after apartheid.
He believes he can unite his people through sport, so he decides to unite rugby players who are outsiders on a global scale.
The South African team will eventually advance to the 1995 World Cup.
Freeman worked for several years to get Mandela’s story to the screen.
I had no other goal than to play this role so that I could bring it as close to reality as possible,” Freeman said.
The biggest challenge, of course, was to speak like him.
The actor said that if he and the world politician were from the same area, he would try to meet Mandela, have dinner with him, be behind the scenes before his speech.
The most important thing was that he wanted to shake Mandel’s hand.
I found that when I push your hand, I take over your energy, it is transmitted, and I felt like I knew how you felt, he said.
It’s important for me to try to become another person.
Matt Damon plays François Pienaar, the captain of the national rugby team dominated by white players.
The actor said he had six months to prepare for a role in the tough world of rugby.
A great surprise for him eventually was when he first met Pienaar in his house.
I remember how I ringed the home bell, he opened it to me, and the first thing I told Françoise Pienaar in my life was, ‘In the movie I look much bigger.’
Despite the obvious differences in the characters of the actors compared to their actual subtitles under the direction of director Eastwood, Invictus: The Unbeaten received positive reviews and it is also spoken about ambitions for an Oscar.
Daily Variety film critic Todd McCarthy summed up his ratings in the words: “It was a very good story, a very well-made film.”
In film reviews on the website rottentomatoes.com, Invictus received 76 percent of positive reviews.
Mystery of the glow over Norway unraveled: Russians tested a missile
Over Norway, a strange light effect of unknown origin was observed.
The Russian Defence Ministry recently admitted that it had tested an intercontinental ballistic missile near the Norwegian border.
The launch was again unsuccessful, and a missile called the Bulava type, which was originally supposed to be the pride of the Russian army, is slowly becoming a nightmare for Russian generals and the Prime Minister Vladimir Putin.
Even his repeated presence in the missile tests had no proper effect on the success of the test flights.
The bulava usually did not take off at all or was damaged in the air.
In Russian newspapers, "Bulava" has already been described as a "missile that does not fly".
A rocket that does not fly but shines
The 13th attempt started normally.
At the end of the flight, the aircraft was technically damaged.
The engine exploded in the third stage of the rocket.
This time, the Bulava launched from the atomic submarine Dmitry Donsky, which sailed under the White Sea.
This type of missile can be fired from a vessel that is in motion and also submerged.
Therefore, it is likely that the mysterious light over Norway caused by an undetermined flying object was actually the broken "Bulava".
The Norwegians did not doubt at first that it was a Russian missile.
The generals are defending this time, saying that it is impossible to speak unambiguously about failure.
The first two degrees of the rocket lasted, and the accident hit the third.
In the previous cases, the engines were broken in the first stage.
Despite the fact that none of the test launches were completed without a mistake, the Ministry of Defense considers only six out of thirteen launches to be unsuccessful.
A fifty percent success rate therefore fills the generals with optimism and so they still say that the "Bulava" will one day fly without problems and that it will even hijack up to ten hypersonic nuclear blocks with a maximum total weight of 1.15 tons.
Fetisov signed an annual contract with CSKA Moscow at the age of 51
Legendary defender Vjačeslav Fetisov will once again appear in a professional hockey match at the age of 51.
The former world champion, Olympic winner and Stanley Cup holder will help his team CSKA Moscow in need and will probably take part in the Friday match of the KHL against St. Petersburg.
Fetisov, who ended his career at the age of forty in 1998, is currently CSKA president.
After Denis Kuljaš is injured, we need another defender.
Fetisov regularly trained and agreed to help the team.
We need to solve some formal matters, the coach of the Moscow club Sergei Nemtsinov quoted the AP as saying.
It is not yet clear whether the comeback of the famous hockey player will concern only one match.
I think Fetisov is one of those who can raise the spirit of other players.
Fetisov will be the oldest Russian professional hockey player if he returns to the ice.
In the NHL he played the entire season for Hartford legendary striker Gordie Howe at the age of fifty-one, adding 15 goals and 26 assists.
The oldest of the famous five Fetisov, Kasatonov - Makarov, Larionov, Krutov is one of the best and most successful hockey players in history.
In the Soviet Union, he won two Olympic gold medals, seven world championship titles, triumphed in the Canada Cup and the junior world championship.
In the second part of his career, he also collected successes in the NHL, where he raised the Stanley Cup twice in Detroit.
Since 2001 he has been a member of Hockey Hall of Fame.
Hyundai Agrees to Cancellate All Overtime
Hyundai has agreed with trade unions to abolish all overtime.
As a result of overtime strikes, trade unions have declared a strike alert on Monday.
This was confirmed by Hyundai Motor Group spokesman Petr Vaněk.
However, it is planned to negotiate with the trade unions on another meeting this Saturday.
We cannot resign on our production plan, it is fundamental, so a voluntary overtime was proposed on Saturday, December 19, with two shifts being made, Vaněk said.
Server Sedmička.cz wrote that the company of employees who work on a Saturday shift offered a bonus of CZK 400.
They will be returned on Saturday, November 28.
The company has decided to change the way employees are motivated for proposed overtime.
Either they get to pay a surcharge for overtime or they can choose a replacement leave on December 28th, and thus extend the Christmas holidays by a day, Vaněk said.
In addition, all employees of the Saturday shift will receive paid ticket and lunch.
Given that overtime was the most urgent and the most burning point in terms of comments and complaints of trade unions, and protesting employees, which last week essentially stopped production, the management decided yesterday afternoon with immediate effect to cancel all overtime for the month of December, Vaněk said.
Employees were forced to work two hours overtime every day after an eight-hour shift.
Once the agreement is signed, the unions will withdraw the strike.
The next meeting between the company’s leadership and trade unions is scheduled for Friday morning.
Trade union chief Petr Kuchař said on Wednesday that if they agree to meet the requirements and sign a joint document, they are ready to cancel the strike emergency.
The situation in the automaker worsened last week on Wednesday, when about 400 employees spontaneously went on strike due to constant overtime.
They also protested against poor pay conditions and alleged bullying.
The management opposed that overtime workers had to do to meet the requirements for car deliveries.
The unions also called for no sanctions to be imposed on workers who stopped production on Wednesday.
In the area of overtime, the trade unions demand that the company reduce overtime work to a minimum.
In addition, they want to pay a prize of £5,000 this year.
Hyundai currently employs 2,000 people.
The company started serial production in November last year.
By September this year, it produced approximately 80,000 cars, its current production capacity is 200,000 cars a year.
Czech Discovery: A Substance That Takes Into 'HIV' Viruses
A team of Czech and German scientists are testing new compounds that can slow the spread of the HIV virus in the body.
The main advantage of the enhanced substance is that it also occupies viruses that have already gained immunity against drugs.
This fact in some cases overrides the fact that the compound on the common variant of the virus does not act as strongly as some already available medicines.
AIDS cannot be cured.
However, a mixture of drugs that prevent the multiplication of the HIV virus in the body can significantly extend the life of patients.
However, their use is accompanied by a number of side effects.
Incomplete suppression of the multiplication of the virus has also resulted in the development of so-called resistant viruses, against which drugs are already ineffective.
The work of experts from three institutes of the Czech Academy of Sciences, VŠCHT Prague and the University of Heidelberg opens the way to deal with the virus resistance.
They have shown that substances called metallocarbonates act on the protein responsible for the multiplication of the HIV virus.
Metalcarborans are compounds of boron, hydrogen, carbon and cobalt.
These compounds block the spread of the virus differently than all the drugs used today, and therefore can overcome the problem of resistance.
In their work, scientists come up with new ‘improved’ compounds prepared on the basis of knowledge of the molecular mechanism of their binding to the viral protein.
Metal carbonates have a unique three-dimensional structure: two multi-walled cages made up of bore, hydrogen and carbon atoms are connected by a metal atom, in this case cobalt.
Strange and Resilient Virus
HIV protease is a protein of the HIV virus that is essential for the life cycle of the virus.
Without the HIV protease-induced splitting of the HIV virus, mature infectious viral particles would not be produced.
When we stop HIV protease, we also stop the spread of the virus in the patient’s body, the scientists explain in a press release issued by the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry of the Czech Academy of Sciences.
In a paper published in the Journal of Medicinal Chemistry, researchers describe a series of compounds in which two pairs of cages (see table) are connected by a short organic chain, which is further systematically modified.
A little weaker but more reliable.
The effect of this series of anti-HIV protease substances has been tested in the tube and also against its resistant (resistant) variants obtained from patients infected with the HIV virus.
The effect of metalocarbonates on the common variant of the enzyme is not as strong as that of clinically used drugs, but it does not lose its effect for resistant variants against which drugs are often ineffective.
The unique mechanism of action and also their other properties such as biological and chemical stability, low toxicity and the possibility of further chemical modifications make metalcarborans interesting compounds for further research towards the design of effective drugs against HIV, says Pavlína Rezáčová, head of the Laboratory of Structural Biology of the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry and the Institute of Molecular Genetics of the Academy of Sciences.
Fighting for the budget: ODS goes to Fisherman, he defends
ODS chief Mirek Topolánek described the approved budget for next year as "terrible" and the government of Prime Minister Jan Fischer should consider further existence.
The Prime Minister’s statement was called a strong statement.
Give it time to analyze.
Deputy Chairman of the ODS Petr Nečas said that the concept of an official cabinet with the support of ČSSD, ODS and the Green Party no longer works.
The Prime Minister must decide whether he intends to rely on a minority in the House, which is about fighting the growing deficit, or whether he is about staying in office with the help of the parliamentary left.
The approach of the ODS and social democracy to the issue of public deficits is diametrically different.
On Wednesday, the House adopted the 2010 budget, with leftist amendments worth more than SEK 12 billion.
The parliament increased the money for the salaries of state employees, for the operation of social services and for direct payments to farmers.
The government’s reproach to social democracy’s proposals was that they hiddenly increased the budget deficit.
The Czech Republic has a deficit of SEK 163 billion.
The ODS left the chamber before the vote, so that it met the wishes of the government that even the amended budget is a less bad variant than the provisional budget.
Disappointment and vanity
Finance Minister Eduard Janota spoke of disappointment and feeling vanity, Prime Minister Jan Fischer said that the government will evaluate the current situation.
Nečas is convinced that if Janota seriously threatened to resign in the event of the adoption of amendments, the situation could look different.
According to the Czech television, Janota ordered Monday after the government to the prime minister.
He said he is considering remaining in office.
The reason is his disappointment with the budget negotiations.
If Fischer speaks out for further fighting the budget deficit, they do not have anything to do in the government, according to Nečas, the nominants of the ČSSD, which promoted the changes in the budget.
The prime minister should also make it clear that he will resign if the House passes other deficit-increasing laws, such as those relating to sickness, pensions, or amendments to the Civil Service Act.
Topolánek: Ministers nominated by ODS did not blame themselves
This is a matter of the Prime Minister Fischer and the entire government.
The ministers nominated by the ODS did nothing wrong, Topolánek stressed in a text message from the United States.
He reminded that in several ministries there are people in the deputy functions reporting to the TOP 09, who voted against the budget.
Nečas stressed that if Fischer decides to resign on the principle of fighting the deficit of public finances, "it is absolutely logical and correct that he will rely on the leftist majority that is currently in the House."
He said he could not count on the support and tolerance of the Democrats.
I didn’t think about it, and when it’s up to date, I’ll be dealing with it,” Defense Minister Martin Barták told reporters in the House of Representatives, who was nominated to the government by the Civil Democrats.
In the afternoon, Prime Minister Fischer went to Brussels for the European Council meeting.
At the request of the Prime Minister, ODS resigned
Nečas also stressed that the ODS would probably vote against the amended budget in the House on Wednesday if the Prime Minister did not explicitly ask the civil democratic MPs to allow the adoption of the budget.
We do not feel as orphans, we are not small children, he responded then to the question whether the ODS during the political negotiation on the budget did not weigh the absence of the party chairman in parliament and the Czech Republic.
I didn’t notice my voice was missing.
Even when I gave up my mandate, I knew that in the coming months it would be primarily the Bolshevism of the House and the destruction of everything positive.
According to the new regulation, fewer trains will travel for almost the same fare.
Czech railways will cancel or restrict some less loaded high-speed trains and locations from 13 December, while other connections will be strengthened.
The total range of traffic will be reduced by 2 percent from the date of entry into force of the new schedule.
Most tariffs, including the basic and customer fare, will remain unchanged.
For example, inhabitants of Ostrava will get more connections to the capital, and rails will add one pendolino set to this track.
The high-speed train will stop traveling to Bratislava.
There will also be fewer buses on the Prague - Písek - České Budějovice route, and the direct connections Prague - Letohrad will be substantially limited.
From the regions, the rails plan the largest reduction of traffic in the Královéhradecký region, a total of eight percent, on the increase, on the other hand, can enjoy Prague and the surrounding area.
Two night trains on the Prague - Tábor - České Budějovice route are also cancelled, and the operation of several high-speed trains on the Prague - Písek - České Budějovice route is limited only to some days of the week.
The biggest changes include the introduction of a new direct line from Milovic to Prague, today they have to move in Lysé nad Labem.
It is the fifteenth line of the Esko suburban system, its opening is possible thanks to the completion of the electrification of the line from Lysé nad Labem to Milovic.
Long-haul connections to the capital will end at the Prague Main Station.
ČD will introduce more SC Pendolino connections between Prague and Ostrava and trains to Šumperk/Jeseník will go at two-hour intervals.
Travellers will no longer be able to travel by pendulum to Bratislava since December 13.
Regional Railway bill: 200 million more
The railways are ordered and paid by the Ministry of Transportation, in total to pay for the so-called proven losses will give railways next year four billion crowns, as this year. locals are ordered by the counties, in total will pay for them next year eight billion crowns, with less than three billion crowns to contribute the state.
This year, regional trains are 200 million more expensive.
The railways have a new 10-year contract, so far the contract has always been for one year.
Trains are praising the system, and therefore apparently did not succeed in raising the price of the overwhelming majority of tickets.
Changes will only occur for the one-day net tickets of ČD Net and cheap online tickets of eLiška.
For passengers without a customer card, the price of ČD Net will increase from SEK 450 to SEK 600.
The price of the eLiška will be newly derived from the traveled distance, so far it was unified for the journey between any regional cities and amounted to SEK 160.
Philippines: Over 50 people detained, children released
At least 75 people were abducted in the south of the Philippines, including a number of primary school students and their teachers.
This was by AFP, which initially only 65 kidnapped.
All 17 children were released after eight hours, including one teacher.
It is located in the province of Agusan del Sur.
Some 19 militants used hostages as a living shield to escape police.
Local negotiators are now trying to agree on the extradition of the remaining hostages.
The attackers belong to the New People’s Army (NPA), an armed unit of the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP).
According to AP, the kidnapper was initially pursued by police for violence that required settling accounts between two local family clans.
In the southern province of Maguindanao, Philippines, a law enforcement has been declared over the recent massacre that killed 57 people.
Thirty journalists were among the victims of the November 23 massacre related to the governor's office elections.
For suspicion of involvement in the massacre, the governor of this southern Philippine province and his father, Andal Ampatuan, a patriarch of the influential family of Ampatuan, were arrested.
There are Muslim separatists on the island of Mindanao.
The two sides resumed peace talks with the Philippine government on Tuesday.
JAR story affects everyone, says Morgan Freeman alias Mandela
In the coming days comes to the U.S. cinemas a new Hollywood film by Clint Eastwood Invictus (official title in Czech: Invictus: Undefeated), which captures part of the life story of former President of South Africa Nelson Mandela.
The role of the world-famous anti-apartheid fighter was played by Morgan Freeman, whom Mandela chose to play years ago.
South African rugby champion Francois Pienaar is played by Matt Damon.
With the introduction of the film into cinemas, it emerges from the reviews of critics and the public.
Nelson Mandela
Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela was born on July 18, 1918 in Mvez, South Africa.
He was awarded the Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought in 1988 and the Nobel Peace Prize in 1993 together with De Klerk.
He was President of South Africa from 1994 to 1999.
Big expectations, as it comes to the public at a time when in South Africa, on the one hand, the preparations for the World Cup in football are peaking, but at the same time the media is shaken by disturbing reports of rising racial hatred and discrimination against the population by the black ruling majority.
According to the AP news agency, the reviews of the new film in the JAR are for the time being quite positive, despite numerous reservations about the casting of the main roles by the "blowing" Hollywood stars.
Morgan Freeman is proud of his new film.
I’ve been dreaming about this role for years and I’ve been preparing for it well.
I also personally met Nelson Mandela many times to – as they say – recharge his energy, he said in an interview after the film’s ceremonial premiere in Los Angeles.
I think it’s good if we can remind Mandel’s personality and message with the film.
It’s the story of South Africa, but it affects everyone, he added.
National Rugby Team
Based on a book by British writer John Carlin titled In the role of the enemy: Nelson Mandela and the game that gave rise to the nation, the film portrays a South African human rights defender during his first presidential term.
Morgan Freeman thus tries to combine two racial and for many years mutually defined groups of the population during the film, and like Nelson Mandela in 1995, he also enters in an acting role in the South African National Rugby Dress on the field of the World Cup, which JAR then won.
For entering the lawn in a dress, which is understood almost as something sacred in JAR, Mandela gathered great applause from a predominantly white audience fourteen years ago and won the recognition of the white population.
A football championship may be able to reunite people into one nation again, said rugby player Chester Williams, who was the only "black" in the national team in 1995.
Whether the situation will improve in the spring will only be revealed.
White South Africans, however, are skeptical, as a recent interview with LN revealed by rugby fan Christopher Dawson, who fled the country to Britain.
The championship starts on June 11, 2010.
In Lithuania, a transformator is burning for tens of millions of crowns
The fire struck the transformator of the company Čeps in the power plant near the village of Výškov in Lounsk.
According to the spokesman of the local firefighters Lukáše Marvana, six units are involved in the fire.
Initially, firefighters wanted to let the transformator burn out, but later re-evaluated the opinion and extinguished the fire with a mixture of water, foam and special fire extinguishments.
The cause was a technical failure, an internal shortcut of the transformator.
No one was injured, according to the company spokesman Pavla Mandátová, the accident does not threaten the safe operation of the transmission system.
The damage is estimated at several tens of millions of crowns and can only be estimated after the fire ends.
A destroyed transformer will need to be replaced with a new one.
In the ten years of the Cheps company, nothing like this has happened, defects of this type are rare, she added.
Electricity supplies were not interrupted, according to the spokeswoman of ČEZ for the northern Czech Republic Soni Holinger Hendrych, the functioning of households, authorities or companies the fire of the traffic station did not affect.
A.s. Čeps operates on the territory of the Czech Republic as an exclusive operator of the transmission system, electric lines 400 kV and 220 kV.
Itins, renovates and develops 39 power stations with 67 transformers transmitting electricity from the transmission to the distribution system and lines with a length of 4,339 kilometers.
Jančura to file criminal complaint for blasphemy against three heads of the ČSSD
Student Agency owner Radim Jančura will file a criminal complaint today for defamation of three social-democratic heads.
And this is Michal Haška from the South Moravia region, Radko Martínka from the Pardubican region and heathman of the Olomouc region Martin Tesařík.
He said this in Twenty Minutes of Radio.
The complaint is related to the company's attempt to operate regional rail transport in some regions.
At the end of the day, all the regions signed long-term contracts with the Czech Railways.
All three heathens are attacking us and talking about choosing grapes, but we only offered what they wanted.
They claim that we are more expensive than the Czech Railways, which is not true because we know the prices of the Czech Railways, which were closed last week.
We only have to defend ourselves.
It’s for blasphemy against the Student Agency, he told RadioJournal Jančura.
At the same time, he said he has evidence from all the counties that they did not act in accordance with European law.
It is preparing an initiative for the European Commission.
Hašek considers the filing of a criminal complaint as a further continuation of Mr. Janchury’s media show, which serves him as an unpaid advertisement by his company and his own person.
I am, of course, ready to defend the good name of my country and I will call on the other heathmen to do the same.
I suppose that even on this occasion it will be clear that it is Mr. Janchura who is manipulating the public in the matter of regional rail transport and using false and false arguments, Hašek said.
Jančura announced last week that he was investing several million crowns in advertising, which will alert the districts to the unfavourable move.
He told the radio magazine that he would stop the campaign after Christmas and want to continue it after the New Year.
He said the campaign would be aimed at combating corruption.
The campaign was launched by Jančura after the counties agreed to operate regional rail connections with the Czech Railways and did not publish tenders for a contract of around SEK 150 billion.
According to Janchura, such actions are unlawful and contrary to the opinion of the European Court of Justice.
Because of the criticism of train traffic in the counties already threatened Jančur, according to him, a member of the ČSSD.
The only threat was that if we didn’t, we could lose the bus license.
He presented himself as a member of the ČSSD, I know which lord it is, I will not say his name, he told RadioJournal Jančura today.
Pneumococcal vaccination will be free and optional
Pneumococcal vaccines will be introduced in January.
It is free and at the same time optional for families.
There is no doubt that compulsory vaccinations are more effective.
Preparations for the introduction of free pneumococcal vaccination are culminating.
The Institute of Medicines has already set the maximum prices for vaccines to be paid by health insurance companies.
Experts are also clear about vaccination.
New vaccines
Free vaccines for August children
Children born on and after August 2 may be vaccinated against pneumococcal disease.
The condition is that they have not yet received a single dose of the vaccine.
Those who started vaccinating last year or earlier, must pay for another re-vaccination.
The first dose of the vaccine should be given between 3 and 5 months of age.
Last year, a quarter of children were vaccinated against pneumococci.
Parents paid 1,600 kroner for one and more.
For young children, four doses are required.
Overall, experts estimate that health insurance companies will spend 300 to 450 thousand crowns per year on vaccination benefits.
It will save on the treatment that children without vaccination would need.
Until now, the state has paid about 500,000 dollars per year for all child vaccinations.
The vaccine was introduced through the so-called Janot package.
Pneumococcus causes inflammation of the middle ear, but also serious infections including inflammation of the brain blades and blood poisoning.
Pneumococcal infections will kill up to 28 children under 10 years of age in the country every year.
In addition to the Czech Republic, it has introduced covered-up vaccination of children against pneumococci in about 40 countries.
Is vaccination mandatory?
However, there is a possibility that vaccines will be mandatory in the future.
It will be covered by insurance companies and optional from January.
That obligatory vaccination would be better, suggested, for example, the head of the civil association Nahlas Rudolf Kalovský.
His association has long promoted pneumococcal vaccines.
Experts at the international conference that our association attended were not entirely satisfied with the fact that we have voluntary vaccination.
It is not entirely ideal.
We are pleased that at least this has been achieved.
I think that’s the path we need to take now, Kalovsky said.
The Ministry of Health does not want to change the procedure for pneumococcal vaccination.
At the moment, we are not thinking about it at all, his spokesman Vlastimil Sršeň said.
Voluntary vaccination has its disadvantages, doctors say
Hana Cabrnoch, Chair of the Professional Society of Practical Pediatrics, acknowledges that voluntary vaccination has its disadvantages.
If all children were vaccinated, it could be considered to reduce the number of re-vaccinations “When this vaccine costs such a high amount, we quite understand the political decision that this vaccination was started as voluntary,” says Cabrnoch, however.
Experts expect more than 80 percent of new parents to get their babies vaccinated against pneumococci from next year.
Pneumococcal vaccination is also a breakthrough in the fact that it is paid by health insurance companies, not the state, as the first public vaccination of children.
Insurance companies should spend money on prevention, saving on further treatment, Cabrnoch explains.
Doctors will have to buy the drugs themselves.
This, however, is related to the concerns of practical children’s doctors concerning the purchase of vaccines.
According to the original intention, vaccines should be purchased by insurance companies, and doctors would receive them in the same way that the state supplies them with substances for other vaccines.
Some members of the parliament feared that insurance companies would be able to “pull out money from health insurance.”
Doctors will have to buy the drugs and wait for insurance companies to pay them back.
It is estimated that individual pediatric practitioners will invest 40,000 a month in vaccines, which is a significant amount.
It’s not going to be easy, says Cabrnoch.
American artist's son 'stolen in a museum'
The son of renowned American fantasy creator Frank Frazetta has been accused of attempting to rob paintings worth $20 million (12 million pounds) from his father's museum.
Police in Pennsylvania said that Alfonso Frank Frazetta was caught loading 90 paintings into his vehicle and trailer.
Named Mr. Frazetta and the other man used a bagr to rob a museum in the Poconco Mountains region.
Mr. Frazetta senior, 81, became famous for creating the characters Barbara Conan and Tarzan.
At the time of the incident, the artist was in Florida, the Associated Press.
The AP quoted an unnamed police officer as saying that Mr. Frazetta Jr. may have been motivated by a long-lasting family dispute.
In front of the police, Mr. Frazetta Jr., aged 52, issued an oath declaration that he did so on his father's instructions "to get to the museum by any possible means and move the paintings to the reconciliation spaces," the agency said.
Mr Frazetta senior denied any such authorisation, as stated by the agency.
Labour opposes planned tax increases
The ministers advocated the tax increases and spending cuts announced in the preliminary budget report against criticism from the opposition, businessmen and trade unions.
As Alistair Darling said, the Tory have "missed" an opportunity to show that they are serious about postponing the decision to reduce the deficit until the post-election period.
The chancellor was also put under fire because of the disability of low- and middle-income workers.
According to his proposal, it is mainly a 0.5 percent increase in social security and 1 percent adjustment of public payments since 2011.
Resentment on Social Insurance
Trade unions protested that low-income workers were punished for a recession they didn’t blame and warned in advance of “problems.”
Social security is on the rise – an increase of approximately £3 trillion a year – which has outraged the community of entrepreneurs who have said it’s an employment tax while focusing on the recovery of the economy.
This increase, limited to those revenues exceeding £20,000 per year, will affect approximately 10 million workers.
Key points of PBR
Social Security will increase by another 0.5% from April 2011
Economic situation will deteriorate more than expected, by 4.75% this year
50% tax on bankers’ bonuses
Increase in 1% corporate tax for small business depreciation
Reduced taxes on electric vehicles and wind turbines
Increase of pensions by 2.5%
According to the state finance administration’s estimate, some £30,000 income will decrease by £90 per year and some £40,000 income will decrease by £190 while some £10,000 income will increase by £110.
The ministers said their goal of halving the deficit by 2013 was a “complex decision,” but insisted that 60% of the special taxes should fall to 5% of the highest-income.
Finance Minister Stephen Timms has denied that the proposed tax increases and spending cuts would be a “drop in the ocean” compared to what would have to be done.
“This will allow us to halve the deficit, which is an absolute basic requirement for the next four years,” the BBC said.
Mr. Timms said he is convinced that economic growth should occur at the turn of the year.
But drawing up a forecast for future economic growth – which will affect the amount of loans needed and how quickly the deficit will be reduced – must be taken into account after the Chancellor has been forced to revise previous amounts.
In a statement, he said the decline in the economy was 4.75 percent this year – far worse than the 3.5 percent decline forecast in April – because loans were 3 trillion pounds higher than previously estimated.
Missed Opportunity »
Conservatives, who launched a new campaign on Thursday warning of Labour's "debt crisis", called the planned loan of £789 trillion over the next six years unbearable.
The ministers failed to present a credible plan as it could be paid, they added, "cynically" postponing this decision until the time after the elections - which must take place by June 2010.
"They didn't add anything significant that would be feasible," said Shadow Finance Minister Philip Hammond. "They had the opportunity to do it, but they wasted it."
"All important announcements will be made after the election if we win them"
Roger Bootle, Deloitte
Labour insist that schools, hospitals and police will be protected from future cuts unlike Tory’s proposals, which would want to cut the deficit faster and on a larger scale.
But Liberal Democrats argue that the money earned by raising taxes and cutting spending should be used to support spending in the next year and not to reduce the deficit, arguing that plans are “built on the sand.”
BBC political commentator Nick Robinson said about the timing of the announcement — for example, the above-mentioned inflation will rise and the benefits will not be paid in April next — that this could lead to the Chancellor being charged in the election campaign if the money was hard to get back a year later.
But Labour insist on providing special aid if people are in great need, and the situation will be revised in September 2010.
Suspicious Budget
Although ministers did not disclose details of spending after 2011, economists said it was clear that cutting public spending would only be the beginning of medium-term constraints.
The recognised Institute for Budget Studies said Chancellor's figures suggested significant cuts in many areas, potentially including transport, higher education and defense.
“It’s really very painful so far,” said its director Robert Chote.
“All important statements will come after the election, if we win them,” said Roger Bootle, an economic adviser to Deloitte’s account revisor.
"It was a report on a suspicious preliminary budget.
FBI launches investigation into 'American prisons in Pakistan'
The FBI is conducting an investigation in a Pakistani prison for five Americans suspected of linking to extremists.
The men were arrested for the attack on a house in Sargoda in eastern Punjab province, the U.S. Embassy in Pakistan said.
The FBI said it was investigating whether they were the same men who were declared missing last month at their residence in Virginia.
The U.S. State Department said it was also seeking information about these men.
Three of them are said to have originated in Pakistan, one of them has Egyptian ancestors and the others are from Yemen.
"If they were U.S. citizens, we would be very interested in the conditions under which they were detained and in what circumstances they stayed there," spokesman Ian Kelly said.
FBI spokeswoman Katherine Schweit said the agency was informed of the arrest and was in contact with the families of the missing students.
“We are working with the Pakistani authorities to determine their identity and the nature of their actions here and whether they are actually missing students,” she said.
The Pakistani embassy in Washington said the men were arrested in a house belonging to one of their uncles.
It stated that the house had always been the center of interest of the local police and that no charges had yet been brought against the arrested men.
Secretary of State Hillary Clinton declined to comment on the arrests, Reuters said, but said the United States must "work much closer with Afghanistan and Pakistan to uncover the infrastructure of terrorism that ends up recruiting and training people."
The disappearance of these five students from their home in Northern Virginia was by their families in late November.
Amnesty for Iranian persons tortured.
The human rights situation in Iran is as bad as it has been in the last 20 years, according to an Amnesty International expedition report.
The report describes in detail the "methods of torture" in the regime before and after the disputed June presidential elections.
One of the men said he was beaten and burned with cigarettes; another said he was threatened with rape.
Iran has denied the above-mentioned criticism of the report on respect for human rights.
Officials described the criticism as politically motivated.
In Iran, thousands of people have been imprisoned and dozens killed after the controversial election of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, leading to the biggest street demonstrations since the 1979 Islamic Revolution.
Dozens of them were jailed and the prosecutors sentenced the last five to death.
BBC correspondent in Tehran John Leyne, who is now in London, said that earlier in the protests, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khomeini declared some forms of torture illegitimate and banned their implementation in the Karizak correction facility.
But almost no criticism of the lawful power has been tolerated since then, as our correspondent stated.
false confession
Amnesty International quoted a report by 26-year-old computer student Ibrahim Methari, who said he was accused of "working with Facebook" and protesting against the election results.
“I was often beaten in the face,” he said in a statement.
“They burned me with cigarettes under my eyes, on my neck, on my head... They threatened me with execution and humiliated me.”
After five days, he signed a false confession and was released and left on the street, still bleeding and half unconscious, Amnesty said.
In August, defeated presidential candidate Mehdi Charroubi was arrested after the elections and tortured to death in prison, while others were raped.
High-ranking Iranian officials have denied the allegations of rape, but have admitted that the torture occurred.
Amnesty also the case of a former prisoner who said he had been held in a container with 75 other people for more than eight weeks in a prison in Kahrizak.
Amnesty acknowledged that the Iranian parliament and justice had set up committees to investigate election riots and government responses, but said the authorities' mandate and powers were unclear and the findings of parliamentary committees were not published.
The group said at least 90 people had been detained in the past three weeks to prevent further protests.
A ski slope was created in the city park
More than 100 tons of artificial snow have been used to turn the monument in Bristol into a racing runway for the race.
The runway for the park race attracted 16 semi-professional skiers and snowboarders to compete for financial prizes.
At the top of the skating track in Brandon Hill Park was a short jumping bridge before a 100m long skating track.
John Hickman, a fourth-year student of medicine, said it was a wonderful view from the top of the riding track, but that it was actually frightening.
It was a beautiful view of the flashing lights of the city below.
There were some of the best skiers and snowboarders from all over the country – some of them real talents,” he added.
The prizes were awarded for the best pieces - or manoeuvres on the runway.
After the Thursday evening race, the snow was left to melt.
Always they and we
Can a Muslim be a Frenchman?
Pluralism and pragmatism in a secular state.
At a time when Swiss voters were calling for a ban on the construction of minarets and alarming reports of the alleged Islamization of Europe were spreading, John Bowen, an American academic, wrote and informed and wondered whether Muslims could integrate – and whether they would integrate – into one of the continent’s most open secular societies.
Some of the readers, after reading this book, became admirers of the author’s latest work, “Why the French don’t like shorts on their heads” (2006), this elegant and discussed study of controversial issues that have divided and employed the country for 15 years and whose effects are still felt today.
Mr. Bowen’s latest book has a broader and much more ambitious outline.
As a good anthropologist, he wants to know not only what politicians and the media have said about Islam in France, but what actually happened at the core.
He spent months in mosques, schools and institutes that now take care of 5 ÷ 6 million French Muslims, what Mr. Bowen calls “Islamic spaces.”
He is a good listener, reproducing debates between teachers and students on the issues that most concern them.
Should a Muslim marry in a mosque or a town hall (or both)?
Should a young Muslim be taught about the development and rights of gay people?
Can a Muslim woman marry a non-Muslim man?
Does a Muslim have the right to use an interest-oriented banking system to obtain a mortgage?
It is these seemingly secular controversial issues that are being discussed and that are part of everyday life rather than the political dramas that the media employs.
The author identifies a new generation of imams, teachers and intellectuals, among other well-known figures, not to mention Tarik Ramadan, an Arab, a Muslim scholar and academic, born in Switzerland.
This new generation is trying to open up a discussion about how one can be both a good Muslim and a good citizen in a modern secular society.
They have no arguments for all their customs.
Conservatives are distrustful of the real idea of French or European Islam.
The philosophers and activists with whom Mr. Bowen interviewed are inclined to assume that it is the opposite of Selafi—the supporters of purist Sunni Islam associated in Saudi Arabia—this group is small, but it affects European Muslims.
Mr. Bowen believes that Muslim values and French secularism are compatible.
But adaptation requires compromises on both sides.
He asks himself how far the French politicians (and the intellectual elite that so fiercely defends the secular public) are truly committed to the idea of pluralism.
It is believed that Muslims probably have less experience in matters of faith than Catholics, Protestants and Jews, who have also had to make historical compromises with secular republicanism.
Rather than the development of pragmatism, he found "the tightening of the screws of values".
Can a Muslim be a Frenchman? After reading this book someone may have a tendency to say "Yes, but not now."
The most hopeless prospects in the world
The Arctic is changing more rapidly than the rest of the planet’s environment.
The boundary ice is melting at an alarming rate, affecting animals and their survival like nowhere else.
The interests of oil, gas and fisheries companies must be focused on new natural water resources, along with diplomats, lawyers and writers in their awakening.
In the book "On Thin Ice", Richard Ellis, a writer and illustrator, portrays the natural history of the iconic North, the polar bear.
Well acquainted with the complicated history and practices of whale fishing, he describes a long tradition of polar explorers who attempted to seize a white bear.
The encounter of Admiral Nelson with a brave fourteen-year-old swimmer who fought only with a musketeer is indeed a myth, but everything else is true.
Young bears swimming behind the bodies of their recently killed mothers were caught and sent to zoos and circuses.
At the beginning of the 20th century, 75 polar bears performed at once in one circus tent.
Even today the gardens in the zoo typically have an area million times smaller than the area available to adult individuals in the wilderness. The climate is rarely suitable: the resident polar bear in Singapore has turned green from algae growing within the hollow hairs of its coat.

Mr. Ellis draws from the works of other writers and historians and often returns to the threat that hunters threaten the survival of species.
Although hunting is prohibited in Norway, America and Russia, killing continues in Greenland and Canada, where helicopters and ski Indians are hunted, and all are armed with powerful assault handcuffs with which they shoot their prey.
Ironically, it is taking place in the waters north of these two hunting nations and that the ice will eventually be the largest.
In his new book "After the Ice", Alun Anderson, former editor of New Scientist, offers a clear and uncomfortable responsibility for science for the Arctic and a captivating glimpse of how the future can change it.
Not all scientists have answers.
Neither meteorologists nor oceanographers have an adequate response to the speed of change.
Because of the lack of testing.
Fridtjof Nansen’s research journeys in the late 19th and early 20th centuries for the first time indicated how floating ice moves.
Submarines during the Cold War then mapped the shifting outskirts as they sailed them.
Satellite exploration and extensive fields of probes in floating glaciers are a useful addition, but many are still taking place thanks to unrestrained individuals, camping in the winter.
Mr. Anderson looks into the extremely fragile world of the spade system inside the Arctic ice, created by the flow of salty water that crumbles when it freezes.
But from the above-mentioned bear to the microscopic wonders inside, everything is doomed to disappear as the summer ice moves, which will happen somewhere between 2013 and 2050.
In a few months, it could be me.
6,000 Marines lay crowns on Arlington tombs
De'Angello Robinson, 19, travelled seven hours by bus to lay a crown on the grave of a soldier he had never met.
For him and the other Marines who traveled from the Johnson camp in Jacksonville, North Carolina to the Arlington National Cemetery to decorate the graves, this was a day to pay tribute to men and women who once wore the same shoes.
In a few months when we board, it may be us, Robinson said of the fallen soldiers.
If this happens to us, I would like someone to do the same for me so that they show me respect as I am trying to do.
He was one of more than 6,000 volunteers who gathered that Saturday morning to lay crowns at the Veterans’ Cemetery in several departments at the pietny act in Arlington.
In 1992, Morrill Worcester, the owner of Worcester’s funeral company in Harrington, Maine, launched this tradition when he and several others decided to decorate several hundred graves at the pietny act in Arlington.
Now it’s an 18-year-old tradition that Mr. nMorill and his wife Karen take this trip every year and stop in different cities along the way to pay tribute to the military and the victims of terrorism.
Worcesters are not looking for profit in this, crowns across America, which they also place in other states.
This year, volunteers have laid more than 16,000 wreaths at Arlington Cemetery, Pentagon territory, graves at Fayetteville National Cemetery in Arkansas, Battery Park in New York City, and United Airlines Flight 93 memorial site in Shanksville, Pennsylvania.
For the second year, the Walmart Foundation has spent more than $150,000 on the purchase and transportation of crowns.
Charleen Hunt, 70 years old, from Westminster, said she made a trip to Arlington to honor her husband, a deceased armed officer.
Since her husband is not buried in Arlington, Mrs. Hunt stated that this was her way to regain what the victim did.
It’s a small way that citizens can support our units, she said.
It’s like visiting a family grave.
Hanging up in warm cloth coats, volunteers walked through the cemetery on the surrounding lawns and hills.
Volunteers headed to older tombs from World War I and World War II and the Vietnam War because they are not visited as often as newer tombs.
The mood was positive when the children played and held their hands together as they transported the young pine to the weird tombstones.
Each round wreath was dark green with a small red arch of the top of the bees.
Near Section 60, where most of the veterans from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan are buried, there is still silence.
Associated service organizations donated 1,000 wreaths to decorate the department, but the gloomy atmosphere of the ongoing wars filled the area.
Some sincerely cried, others prayed, and families and friends held each other in the cold air.
Some read the names out loud, carved into the stones, while others bowed to see the small black-and-white names, pressed into the wet mud where the tombstones had not yet been placed.
Sandra Lockwood was one of many mothers who wiped tears from her eyes before her son’s grave.
She drove eight hours from Zanesfield, Ohio, to visit the last resting place of Naval Artillery Sergeant David Shane Spicer, who died in battle in July.
No one should ever forget why we are single. . .my son paid for it, she said.
"Even though I've been away for a long time, I want to be the one who will remember him."
US government contractor imprisoned by Cuban government officials
The Cuban government has arrested a U.S. government contractor who imported mobile phones and laptops into the country, officials from the State Department said on Saturday.
The supplier, which has not yet been identified, worked for Development Alternatives Inc. based in Bethesda.
The company is working on projects for the U.S. Agency for International Development and the World Bank.
Consular officials, along with the U.S. Interest Section in Havana, sought access to the detainee, who was imprisoned on December 5.
Certain charges have not been made public, but according to Cuban law, a Cuban citizen or foreigner can be imprisoned for almost anything that is described as “dangerous.”
All so-called counter-revolutionary activities, including mild protests and critical states, pose the risk of imprisonment.
Anti-government graffiti and speech are considered serious crimes.
There is a young blogging community in Cuba, led by popular commentator Yoani Sánchez, who often writes about how she and her husband are being monitored and harassed by government agents.
Ms. Sánchez has repeatedly sought permission to leave the country in order to take over prizes, but was denied permission.
The arrest of the U.S. supplier may be a result of rising tensions between the communist Castro brother, ruling Cuba, and the Obama administration, which has been seen as a “retardation tactic” in improving relations with the island.
They were the first to report the arrest of the New York Times on Friday night.
The new US policy stressed that if the Cuban government takes concrete steps, such as releasing political prisoners and creating more space for the opposition, the United States will take reciprocal action.
Mobile phones and laptops are allowed in Cuba, although they are new and sought-after commodities in a country where the average salary of a civil servant is $15 a month.
The Cuban government has granted ordinary citizens the right to buy mobile phones this year; these are mostly used to send text messages, because a 15-minute phone call would cost more than a daily salary.
The use of the internet on the island is extremely limited.
It is available in expensive hotels and for their foreign visitors and on some government connections, such as universities.
Cuban citizens who want to sign up frequently must report their names to the government.
Access to many websites is prohibited.
Having an American detained in Cuba is rare.
Most of the handful of U.S. citizens imprisoned in Cuba are behind bars for acts of bribery, such as drug smuggling, said Gloria Berben, a spokeswoman for the Section for American Interests in Havana.
Ms. Berben said she could not provide more information about the prison.
The incarceration and detention were clearly amoral.
Such activities that would be legal in any other open society — let’s say free mobile phones — are a crime in Cuba, said Miguel Vivanco, director of the U.S. Human Rights Group program, who recently released a negative report on Cuba’s freedoms, called “New Castro, the same Cuba,” as a hint to installing Raul Castro as the leader of the country and replacing his crazed older brother Fidel.
Vivanco said the defendants are often arrested, tried and imprisoned in one day.
He said any solution would be rather political and that the Cuban government is often provoking a negative response in the United States, precisely as the two countries are heading towards a broader dialogue.
Pakistani government officials are uncovering a conspiracy to send men to Afghanistan.
Pakistani authorities on Saturday uncovered the alleged leader of a conspiracy involving sending five men from Northern Virginia to Afghanistan to kill U.S. troops and said they hoped the case could help uncover a large network of terrorist recruits that track the internet and search for radicalized young men.
Investigators said they were searching for a grey rebel personality, known as Saifullah, who invited the men to Pakistan after first discovering them when one of them posted a comment approving the terrorist attacks on YouTube.
Saifullah took over the leadership of these men as soon as they arrived in Pakistan, trying to help them get to the remote area of Pakistan in the Indigenous Tribal Area of Pakistan, which is home to al-Qaeda and its terrorist training camps.
But a Pakistani intelligence official who the case said on Saturday that Saifulullah had failed to convict al-Qaeda commanders and that the men were not part of a CIA attempt to infiltrate a terrorist network.
As a result, they were planted for several days in the eastern district of Sargoda, far from the threatening mountains in the northwest, which became a refuge for terrorists.
They were considered a strike unit.
The reason why they were suspended was stated by an official, who spoke of preserving anonymity given the sensitivity of the case.
The official said the men were not intimidated and were still trying to obtain permission to gain access to al-Qaeda camps when they were arrested by Pakistani law enforcement.
The case of these five - who remained in Pakistan and were questioned by the FBI - highlights the critical role of recruiters in identifying potential terrorists, and, more importantly, determining who is trustworthy.
Since the attacks of September 11, 2001, the U.S. intelligence service has given the highest priority to attempts to deploy human resources into al-Qaeda.
The recruiters of the organization act as guards, dismissing those who are not serious enough in their commitment to the Holy War and those who could be spies.
U.S. fake recruits have been subjected to special investigation by al-Qaeda, analysts said.
But they were also considered extremely interesting in the group because of their potential approach to American targets and their promotion value.
But Evan Kohlmann, a senior analyst at the U.S.-based NEFA Foundation, said that terrorist groups have also become much more cautious in recent years in allowing the skin to access them as U.S. intelligence agencies have recruited experts on their recruitment methods.
If we are trying to penetrate these groups, there is no better way than to follow their recruitment model that has already been followed so much? said Mr. Kohlmann.
This model is one of those that is far more web-based.
Thousands protest in Copenhagen demanding climate action
Tens of thousands of protesters marched on the streets on Saturday to demand stronger climate action from negotiators at the city’s Bella Congress Center.
Protesters the number of many hundreds of thousands of participants in the event, but police say the number was closer to 25,000.
The event was relatively peaceful and a handful of masked activists laid down several small tanks near a group of government buildings in the city center.
On the day a minor incident occurred during the UN-sponsored climate talks, thousands of activists walked through the city carrying banners with the English inscription "This is not Planet B" (i.e. secondary) and one in Spanish, which proclaimed "The country says 'suffice.'"
Several celebrities took part in the protest, including the Danish model and photographer Helena Christensen, who said she had traveled to her mother’s birthplace in Peru and provided me with information about the country’s relentless state of affairs due to the continuing effects of climate change.
This is part of the reason why we have decided to join this great march -- to travel the world and appeal to the world's leaders to submit a fair, ambitious and binding deal, she said.
This is not an easy task, but it is necessary to do it, it cannot always be avoided.
Police prevented protesters from approaching the center of Bella and said they had arrested 19 people, primarily because they either wore masks or had pocket knives.
These activities are prohibited under Danish law during demonstrations.
According to one of the non-participating spectators, who does not want to be identified because he is involved in climate talks, activists disguised as athletes and dressed in black have laid several tanks near the Copenhagen Main Canal, which is located near several ministries.
They agitated at the buildings, he said, starting with lightning, but then followed "several large explosions."
Inside the congress centre, people gathered around TV screens to watch the march during the afternoon.
But the protest probably did not penetrate the consciousness of key officials, such as Su Weie, China’s chief climate negotiator.
When asked whether the demonstration had a constructive impact on international negotiations, he replied in English, "Actually, that is something that I was not aware of."
Then he continued in Chinese and said, “Because the scene is vast, I can’t hear what’s going on outside.”
He watched whether the march was painful or helpful depending on the prospects of each.
It is seen the concentration of the general public and different sectors and the subject of climate change, he said.
In other words: "It can also be said that it is an interference with the actions or freedom of other persons.
Test data revealed persistent persistent racial differences
Last week’s Federal Certificate of Achieved Knowledge in Mathematics was a welcome element of good news about public education in the District of Columbia.
Although the district lags far behind the country’s high-performance systems, the certificate has shown greater progress in fourth and eighth grade students over the past two years than in cities including Atlanta, Chicago and New York.
But what remains hidden behind the latest numbers from the National Attestation Center for Teaching Advancement are the persistent differences in knowledge achieved between African American and white students, both locally and nationally.
The average score of white fourth grade students in Columbia County over the past two years has increased from 267 to 270 points (from a possible 500), but their African-American peers have only risen by three points, from 209 to 212.
The gap in knowledge achieved actually increased between 2007 and 2009 from 53 points to 57 points.
Progress among African Americans in the eighth grade remains essentially balanced, with a deviation of a statistically insignificant one point from 245 to 245.
The average score in white pupils was not included in the test results because the sample size was not large enough.
The picture in the six-year horizon is not just encouraging.
The difference between white and black fourth grade students in 2003, when the first NAEP in the district was carried out, was 60 points on a scale (262 to 202).
Although the achieved result in children from both groups improved during this period, the difference hardly approached 58.
Some district education advocates have stated in the last week that the results celebrated by Secretary Michelle A. Rhee and Mayor Adrian M. Fenty (D) were more widely stimulated by white students where they already had high scores.
That would suggest that we have increased the total support of those at the upper end of the scale, which is problematic and disturbing, said Jeff Smith, executive director of D.C. Voice, a non-profit group that advocates equality in the district.
I’m not jumping up and down because of the two or three-point gap, said D.C. committee member Kwame R. Brown (D-At Large), who has a daughter in fourth grade elementary school in Eaton.
Often criticizing Mrs. Rhee’s style of administration, Mrs. Brown stated that reporting test results means a high school in the city is in a desperate state and requires attention.
Obviously, you always want to see the pros and I respect that.
But what’s terrible is that we didn’t devote almost any time and energy to our high school.
Ms. Rhee said the district’s effort is to continue to find better ways to address the needs of students with low scores.
As a result, for example, some teachers are trained in the use of the new reading curriculum, Wilson’s reading system, aimed at high school students and high school students who have failed to master the basics of reading earlier in their career and are significantly lagging behind their peers.
Daily mathematics and sixth grade math teaching curricula, highlighting the games and real-life experiences that came to the board under former director Clifford Janeyi, can be attributed to the NAEP’s progress last week.
And I just think we should continue to work and make the best possible interventions on those students who remain below the class level, Ms. Rhee said.
Others said the NAEP results clarified the question of whether Ms. Rhee could continue to boost the overall performance of the system and still provide additional money and resources for low-performing schools, which is necessary to reduce the gap.
It’s a certain dilemma of Mrs. Michell Rhee, said Bruce Fuller, a professor of teaching at the University of California in Berkeley where he studies the results of tests in urban areas.
The conventional remedy procedure is to focus resources and administrative reforms on schools located in the worst parts of the District of Columbia.
Thus, the focus can bring about political outcry that is directed against an important agenda.
But the blame, of course, belongs to the other city directors who are trying to keep the middle line between white and black.
We need to focus on building a big school system.
We must strengthen the relationship between our schools so that all families, no matter where they live, can rely on providing their children with excellent public education.
Mr. Janey, now the director of schools in Newark, said in an interview this week that a key element in reducing the gap between achieved results is the extension of the traditional public school year, currently 180 days in the district, to realize the eligibility of schools.
You need to get up to 200 days to push for changes, said Mr. Janey, who signed a contract with his teachers’ association last year for a 185 day school year, which he considers a “symptom” for looking for a greater boost in the next year.
Making higher education part of a better future
The tour bus entered the Gettysburg Railway with a loud rest.
Graciela Rodriguez, 12, came out and rested for a moment on white columns, brick facades, and emerald-green lawns.
Gracielini’s parents had difficulty graduating from college in El Salvador.
So far, Graciela herself, who was born in Silver Spring and lived in Riverdale, has never entered the ground of the track.
Now she and other eighth grade students in the group were exploring Gettysburg, where tuition was $38690 a year, their status was rather than frightened visitors enthusiastic potential students.
It’s that! called Graciela, who would love to study medicine when the guide offered them to enter the building of knowledge.
The gentlemen, really? said thoughtfully when they were told of the low ratio of professors to students.
The Pennsylvania College was one of seven that they visited on their three-day tour and now were entirely obsessed with the future news: The question is not whether you will enter the college.
The question is where.
However, this is a burdensome problem with the high number of U.S.-born children of Spanish immigrants who are excluded from college or pregnant as minors, but there are hundreds of thousands of those who receive college education and thus enter the middle class.
In fact, one-fifth of this "long generation" of Spanish college students - remarkable achievements indicate that many of their immigrant parents, mostly Mexicans and residents of Central America, arrived in the United States without finishing college.
Their success story is important, the researchers say, because it underlines their way forward for a generation that played a marginal role in the country’s workforce field.
Those who achieved a higher education say they had a natural inclination to school and an innate breakthrough and an attempt to succeed.
Many also had parents who set high goals for their children and sought ways to replace the ignorance of American education.
But school programs also play an extraordinary role in helping Graciele and millions of children who would love to graduate from college – especially if these efforts persist over time.
If we take into account the fact that children come from low-income groups whose parents do not have the experience and ability to help them navigate in the system, any simple intervention in each particular point will not solve it, says Patricia Gándara, a researcher at the University of California in Davis, where she studied students from the Latin American region.
We need to think about providing these children with a pre-school network in every way they can get through college.
The federal program that funded Graciela’s rail trip is a useful example.
Known as GEAR UP (prepare), it provides more than $300 million a year for local school systems to run college preparation programs starting for students from low-income groups in high schools and continuing until those students graduate from college.
Since 1999, this program has served more than 10 million students, of whom more than % have entered colleges, according to data from the U.S. Department of Education.
Iraqi Ministry of Oil Industry reaches agreement with 10 foreign oil companies
Despite fears of violence and political instability, the Iraqi government managed to force major oil companies to rebuild their underlying infrastructure during two auctions that took place on Saturday.
Ten agreements have been signed by the Iraqi Ministry of Petroleum Industry with foreign oil companies, suggesting that Chinese, Russian and European oil companies are ready to play a significant role in the restoration of the Iraqi oil industry, paralyzed by decades of wars and sanctions.
American companies left with capital participation in just two of the 10 auctioned fields.
Seven U.S. companies paid for participation in the second auction that began on Friday.
Only one of them made a missing offer.
Two U.S. companies reached agreements on a field that was auctioned in June.
U.S. oil giants’ involvement in the open Iraqi oil industry has surprised analysts.
Iraq finally opened its doors after six years of war and instead of U.S. companies, you have first-hand Asians and Europeans on the way, said Ruba Husari, editor of the Iraq Oil Forum, an online news agency.
This will take a long time before anything else will be on sale in Iraq.
Security concerns highlighted by the massive coordinated bombing attacks on Tuesday and political instability, as well as the withdrawal of the U.S. military, are likely to discourage U.S. companies from much more intense business in Iraq, which has proved to have the third largest raw material reserves, analysts say.
U.S. firms have been disadvantaged in some cases, especially Chinese and other government-controlled energy firms have significantly lower operating costs and are more prone to taking risks because they do not respond to shareholders.
Exxon Mobil and Occidental Petroleum Inc. were the only U.S. companies to have agreements with the ministry.
Leading American firms such as Chevron and ConocoPhillips, whichined close contacts with the Iraqi Ministry of Oil Industry and offered technical assistance in recent years, left empty-handed.
Russian companies Lukoil and Gazprom were top shareholders in two of the contracts awarded at the end of this week.
China’s state-owned National Petroleum Corp. participated in bids for more contracts than any other company and left with large contracts in two major fields.
We all know that China is striving to become a major economic as well as technological power, said Assam Jihad, a spokesman for the Ministry of Oil Industry.
We believe that the Chinese company will be comparable to its competitors and will meet its commitments to Iraq.
Companies that were preliminarily selected to submit bids were then compared by the Ministry by price per barrel and the Ministry is willing to pay for strengthening output above current levels in each field.
The top al-Qaeda planner was killed in Pakistan.
A U.S. missile strike near the Pakistani-Afghan border this week likely killed a top al-Qaeda operations planner, U.S. counterterrorism officials said on Friday.
As confirmed, this could be the second deadly attack on one of the highest terrorist leaders.
Saleh al-Somali was one of two Arabs killed when several rockets hit their car near the town of Miran Shah in North Vaziristan province, according to U.S. sources and Pakistani officials in the area.
Local authorities said the missiles were fired from an unmanned plane of the type operated by the CIA in the area of illegal indigenous tribes.
These were indicated on a white car that was heading to the Afghan border when it was hit, the official, along with the Pakistani intelligence agency, said by telephone from Miran Shah.
The official said the local militants had rushed to the point and quickly seized what was left of the "totally destroyed bodies".
Local authorities were unable to verify the identity of the victims, but two U.S. counter-terrorism officials quoted an unspecified witness who said the Somali was after death.
Somali has been cited as a high-ranking planner of al-Qaeda’s military operations, which directed the operations of terrorist groups outside the region of Afghanistan and Pakistan.
He was involved in the worldwide assassination, said a senior official who did not want to be named, who cited the sensitive nature of U.S. airstrikes on Pakistani territory.
If he held such a central position, he was likely involved in attacks against the United States and Europe.
He received instructions from al-Qaeda’s top leadership and based on them planned possible terrorist attacks.
Another U.S. official said the Somali was rapidly advancing in the al-Qaeda hierarchy and was well linked to other extremist groups in the region.
He didn’t have to be a well-known person to some Americans, but he didn’t humiliate himself in any way to pose in front of us and our allies, another official said.
When his death was confirmed, the Somali was supposed to be the second high-ranking leader of al-Qaeda or the Taliban to be killed since September, when a similar attack killed Najmudin Jalolov, the leader of the militant faction in the Indigenous Tribal Zone, and three other top poperative leaders.
The rate of attacks launched by the CIA using drones has decreased from an average of approximately six operations per month to two, according to records from the Long War newspaper, a website managed by a non-profit group.
The reduction may be due to the improved tactics of terrorist groups that have taken steps to limit their vulnerability by also mercilessly killing people they suspected were whistleblowers, the site said.
The United Nations high delegate in Kabul has resigned.
The UN's top delegate in Afghanistan, Kai Eide, said on Friday that he would like to resign from office in March, ending a tumultuous term that has been plagued by allegations of widespread corruption in the UN-backed election of the Afghan president.
Eide’s departure comes after the Obama administration decided to send an additional 30,000 U.S. troops to Afghanistan.
The U.N. delegate said he supported the increase, but expressed concern that the U.S. timetable to reduce the state, which begins in 18 months, should be a challenge for other NATO governments to withdraw their forces.
We need to accelerate the building of Afghan security forces and send the right signal to the Afghan people that they should have confidence in the international community, Eide said in a telephone interview from Kabul.
The commitment must be long-term.
The Norwegian diplomat also pressured the United States and other military forces to increase the number of international civilian personnel assisting in the political transformation of Afghanistan.
The increase on the side of the armed forces must be copied on the side of the civilians, he said.
Eide said he is not resigning, but is simply fulfilling the promise he made to his family in March 2008 that he will spend only two years in Kabul.
He said he wanted to report to the United Nations.
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said he would need time to find a replacement.
As I said, it is time to look back at the successor, Eide said.
When I came here, there was a two-month vacuum between my predecessor’s departure and my arrival.
According to UN officials, Ban has begun searching for a replacement.
Officials said the decision was made between Staffan di Mistura, a Swedish-Italian who previously headed the UN mission in Baghdad, and Jean-Maria Guehennem, a Frenchman who previously led UN peacekeeping operations.
Eide’s position in Afghanistan was tested after his former deputy, Peter W. Galbraith, was accused in September by President Hamid Karzai of winning the country’s presidential elections of masking the presence of massive electoral machinations.
Eide denied these allegations, but stated that Galgraith's charges -- who were released -- "certainly damaged the mission because there was a high degree of skepticism with regard to international interference" in the election.
Eide said he had proposed a meeting with the High Representative for Citizens to coordinate the relief efforts of the U.S. forces leadership in Afghanistan.
He also urged the UN leadership to allow his successor to hire more workers from the United States and other Western countries to borrow them for the Afghan mission, as he says he would want to strengthen their confidence that their money is used properly.
Eide expressed disappointment over the restriction of her efforts in Afghanistan and said the UN’s hard-working recruitment regulations undermined her ability to use her capabilities.
The UN rules are such that I have had the opportunity to get only one person since May, he said.
It’s a disaster and I can’t continue.
Iran faces new sanctions
Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates said on Friday that world powers would soon impose “further significant sanctions” on Iran over its lack of engagement in talks about its nuclear ambitions.
Gates, who spoke to a group of about 300 U.S. troops in northern Iraq during a week-long trip to areas of war in Afghanistan and Iraq, underestimated the prospects for armed actions against the Islamic Republic.
This is not a good option for Iran, he said in response to a military question on probable developments.
One of the things that depends on me is whether I’ve learned something about Iraq over the last six years, [it’s] the inherent unpredictability of war.
The Obama administration is deciding on a package of sanctions that could affect Iran’s military and political elite, but Gates signaled that some of these sanctions could also affect ordinary Iranians.
He said that “a package of incentives and deterrances” would require “to make the Iranian government actually feel less secure with nuclear weapons” because “its people will be extremely suffering” by sanctions.
According to a Friday statement issued by White House spokesman Robert Gibbs, the administration has involved European leaders in warning that Iran will suffer serious consequences if it does not bring its nuclear program into full compliance with the UN Nuclear Safety Committee and its supervisory body, the International Atomic Energy Agency.
Iran insists that it wants to develop its expertise only for peaceful purposes.
During talks in Geneva on 1 October, he indicated that he wanted to return to talks on limiting his nuclear program and agreed to provide a substantial portion of his reserves of enriched uranium in exchange for the urgently needed fuel for the reactor to conduct medical research.
The administration has advocated such an agreement as a way to establish trust between the two sides and to gain time for negotiations.
But since then, Iran appears to be withdrawing from the provisional agreements – in part because, the expert says, the Iraqi leadership is divided in views on whether to engage with the United States.
Frankly, when it comes to Iran’s stubbornness towards the international community in the case of some of the proposals he actually agreed to in early October, I think it has brought the international community, including the Russians and the Chinese, together on a path that is not about the terminology of additional sanctions against the Iranians, Gates said.
President Obama set a deadline on December 31 for Iran to respond to the proposals before returning to seeking other elections, including surveillance, what Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton once called “degrading sanctions.”
In a statement issued in New York, the Iranian mission to the United Nations on Thursday condemned what it called "unfounded and unfounded accusations" before some members of the Security Committee about Iran's nuclear activities and said it wants to continue talks with the United States and five other world powers "to a reasonable long-term solution.
Gates, who returned to Washington last Friday, met with Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki in the morning before he flew to the oil-rich Kurdistan region to meet with troops in Kirkuk and with Kurdish officials in Irbil.
High tensions persist between the Kurds and the Iraqi Arab majority, over borders, property rights and income distribution.
Gtes urged both sides to reduce the potential for conflict to avoid delaying U.S. plans to limit the number of U.S. troops from 115,000 to 50,000 by the end of August.
U.S. officials quoted Gates as saying to Massoud Barzani, president of the Kurdish regional government: “We want to protect your security, prosperity and autonomy in a united Iraq.
We do not want to leave you.”
In aging China, change of course
Wang Weijia and her husband grew up surrounded by propaganda posters that read that "Mother Earth is too exhausted to feed more children" and "One more child means one more grave."
Then they got the lesson that when the official government posts in Shanghai, alarmed by the low birth rate and aging population in their city, suddenly changed course this summer and began to encourage young couples, their reaction was immediate and determined: Never.
We always devote all our time and energy to one child.
“We’ve left nothing for others,” says Wang, 31, a human resource manager who has an 8-month-old son.
China’s more than 30 years of policy of having only one child has been introduced and has thus created two generations of notoriously bullshit and upset children, affectionately nicknamed “little emperors”, a country threatened by a population crisis.
The average birth rate fell to 1.8 children per couple, compared to six before the policy came into force, according to UN data.
The distribution of the population, where the population aged 60 and above is predicted to grow stormily from 16.7 percent of the population in 2020 to 31.1 percent in 2050.
The imbalance is greater in wealthy coastal cities with a population with a higher education, for example in Shanghai.
Last year, people aged 60 and over made up 22 percent of the registered population in Shanghai, while the birth rate was less than one child per couple.
Xie Lingli, director of the Shanghai City Commission on Population and Family Planning, said many couples need to have children to “help reduce the proportion of the ageing population and reduce the number of workforce in the future.”
He says it's about "being old doesn't mean being rich -- like in developed countries like Japan or Sweden."
Progressive calming
As inserted into the country’s constitution in 1978, China’s one-child policy is probably the most controversial mandate imposed under the Communist Party.
The couples who violated the policy faced enormous fines -- up to three times their annual salary in some areas -- and discrimination at work.
Chinese officials pushed for a policy that helped the country prevent critical exploitation of natural resources, while human rights defenders were condemned in pushing for the policy.
In rural areas, some officials forced pregnant women to undergo abortions when they had a second child.
In addition, many couples had to undergo sexist selective abortions, leading to an unnaturally high ratio of men to women.
In recent years, population officials have been gradually more moderate in their views on the one-child policy.
In 2004, as a rule, they allowed the extent of exceptions—including urban residents, members of national minorities, and cases where a man and a woman were single—and in 2007 they softened the diction of their slogans, advocating a hard line.
Qiao Xiaochun, a professor at the Institute for Population Research at the University of Beijing, said central government officials had previously debated more radical changes, such as allowing couples to have two children if one of the partners was a single child.
In June, Shanghai became the first Chinese city to launch an aggressive campaign to encourage more births.
Almost overnight, posters encouraging parents to have only one child were replaced with copies of regulations detailing how it would be legal to have a second child and how to apply for permission.
The city administration sent family planning officials and volunteers to meet couples in their homes and put leaflets under their doors.
They also promised to provide emotional and financial advice to those who chose to have more than one child.
The reaction was cold, family planning officials said.
A sad reaction
While officials in one rural town around Shanghai have seen an increase in interest in couples wishing to have a second child after the campaign began, most city districts have not any changes.
The city district of Huinan, for example, with a population of 115,000, still recorded four to five cases per month.
Disappointed officials in Shanghai said that despite the campaign, the number of people born in the city in 2010 is still expected to be only around 165,000 – slightly higher than in 2009, but lower than in 2008.
Feng Juying, head of the family planning committee in Shanghai's Caolu district, said financial considerations were probably the main reason why people don't want to have more children.
They want to give the best to the first child, he said.
Yang Jiawei, 27, and his wife, Liu Juanjuan, 26, said they wanted to have two children and were legally allowed to do so.
But like many Chinese, they only have insufficient health and life insurance provided by the government.
Without it, the choice could be irresponsible.
People in the West misrepresent the one-child policy as a controversial legal issue, says Yang, a construction engineer whose wife is in the seventh month of pregnancy in a bond with her first child.
Yes, we were impoverished about the chance to have more than one child.
But the problem is not only in politics.
It is about money.
Other couples state psychological reasons for hesitation.
Wang, a human resource manager, says they only want one child because she was also the only child: “We were the focus of our families and everyone cared about us.
We weren’t used to providing care, and in fact we didn’t want to take care of others.
Chen Zijian, 42, who works with the translation company, expressed this in a much more obscure way.
For two-career middle-class parents who have reduced birth rates, he said, being successful means being selfish.
Today’s 20- and 30-year-olds look at their parents as the first days of the Chinese experiment with capitalism and don’t want this way to feed for themselves, he says.
Just one child puts enormous demands on parents’ time, he says.
A mother must sacrifice at least two years of her social life.
Then there are the controversial spatial questions -- "You must rebuild your apartment" -- and the strategy -- "You must have your resume ready when the child is 9 months old for good preschool education.
Most of his friends want to be content with one child, Che says, but not two.
We are the first generation with higher nutritional standards, he says.
We do not want to make too many victims.
The United Nations Group has drafted a plan to reduce emissions.
The UN-sponsored climate conference -- characterized by far-reaching unconditional positions and mutual support -- focused again on Friday to release a document proposing an ambitious reduction in greenhouse gas emissions over the next 40 years with industrialized nations bearing most of the burden in the near term.
The text, which may provide the starting point for a final political agreement on greenhouse gas regulation, highlights the remaining obstacles as well as lights up the way forward.
But important progress has been seen in the talks that took place at the wrong time with more than 100 world leaders coming to Copenhagen next week.
Created by the UN Ad hoc Working Group, this text unobtrusively states how much money wealthy countries should provide to the poor to cope with global warming in the short and long term.
And it provides a whole range of choices for key issues, including how to develop and manage emerging economies to limit their carbon output and what should be the upper limit of global warming that politicians will still be able to tolerate.
This gives the process a great deal of flexibility, says John Coequyt, chief executive of the Washington Sierra Club.
Michael Zammit Cutajar, who designed the six-page document, tailored the 180-page text from the meeting to focus on what high-ranking UN climate official Yvo de Boer described as “the big picture.”
It overshadows the outlines for a possible agreement in which the industrialized nations could jointly limit their emissions to 25 to 45 percent by the year compared to 1990 levels, while the major developing countries could reduce their emissions to 15 to 30 percent during that period.
Together, the countries would reduce emissions by 2050 between 50 and 95 percent.
The European Union promised to provide $3.6 trillion over the next three years to help poorer countries adapt to climate change – from managing floods and droughts to preventing deforestation.
Still on Friday, however, the same kind of verbal fireworks prevailed in last week’s talks.
U.S. Special Envoy for Climate Change Todd Stern has rejected a speech calling for mandatory greenhouse gas emissions reductions for industrialized countries compared to voluntary reductions for major emerging economies if they weren’t funded by the developed world.
The shift signaled that the Obama administration had set a tougher line towards China just two years ago.
The United States will not join the treaty without transferring major developing countries and implementing action, Stern said, who also complained that the text was not sufficient to secure restrictions and should be checked by external observers.
Stern made this comment an hour after Chinese Deputy Secretary of State He Yafei told the U.S. chief climate negotiator that either a lack of "peasant reason" or "extreme irresponsibility" led earlier this week to the announcement that the United States would not help China financially to cope with global warming.
With the future of the economic path of the major world powers at stake, gaps have broken up both within the developing world and between the industrialized world and emerging economies.
The current struggle is mostly about the preservation of individual economies rather than the preservation of the planet, between China and the United States regarding the fulfillment of their respective commitments, while poorer nations point out that two dozen of the world’s most influential countries ignore the scientific imperative to take more decisive action.
Ricardo Ulate, Costa Rica’s delegate, said it’s not surprising that major powers are fighting for who should bear the cost of limiting greenhouse gases, while vulnerable countries have become much more aggressive in finding ways to prevent large emitters from responsible in their actions.
It’s clearly a game about a new economic hegemony developing, Ulate said, who also serves as a regional adviser on regional climate change in Mexico and Central America for international nature conservation.
Some of the countries that are most vulnerable to the impacts of climate change have indicated that they would like to continue to enforce the legally binding agreement in Copenhagen, but most of the key participants said the best outcome of the talks would be a political agreement.
The Alliance of Small Island States, which has 43 members, produced a 24-page draft agreement last Friday morning.
Artur Runge-Metzger, who led international climate talks for the benefit of the European Commission, said the push by small island nations “has caused a political blow to the entire polyrytic process” in part because they are now united and demand action from growing economies such as China and India.
The negotiations sparked a new urgency as delegates focused on the fact that they had to resolve most of the remaining controversial issues before the heads of government struggled to reach an agreement.
High-ranking officials, such as Indian Environment Minister Jairam Rameš and Chinese deputy minister, came out of the planes and walked through the Bella Center halls to the closed doors of meetings and new conferences so they could set out claims to be considered next week.
The enormous scale of the assembly—when 13,000 people moved daily from and to the congress centre, guitar-playing activists staged ironic shows at night about the countries they thought they had sent them, and proposals were hand-to-hand transmitted on paper rather than by e-mail—controlled by call.
Intensity is only a surge: almost all key ministers were present in Copenhagen and, earlier, in the middle of 60 heads of state.
We got into the high categories, said Carlos Manuel Rodriguez, the deputy minister for global policy at international nature conservation.
Heavy weights are coming.
Britain’s first train with a speed of 140 miles per hour redefined this Monday’s feelings
At 5:13 a.m. on Monday morning, a whisper cut through the darkness to mark the departure of a train, which marked the transport revolution in Britain.
The first high-speed passenger train in the country will reach a speed of 140 miles per hour and fly from Ashford, Kent, to London’s St Pancras, crossing a distance of 58 miles in 38 minutes.
Lord Adonis, the Minister of Transport, then joined Mrs. Kelly Holmes and entered the first high-speed passenger kit outside London.
He hopes the new service will eventually connect Britain with an international network of fast, reliable trains and connect large agglomerations of Midland, the North and Scotland with London.
The overlooked stagnant waters should shorten traffic times in passenger transport and on business journeys, and switching from aircraft and cars to rail could reduce carbon emissions and eliminate congestion on roads.
Theoretically, three major political parties have won for this vision.
But the tens of billions of pounds needed to build a new national rail network, the inevitable struggle for projects and concerns about environmental disruption have now slowed the construction of British high-speed lines.
High Speed Two (HS2), a company created in January to provide the government with a feasible study, passed its report to Lord Adonis on December 30, the Times.
It provided him with a detailed map of the route for the next planned stage of the high-speed network.
The new route between London and West Midland has been designed to be within five meters in urban areas and neighborhoods where the impact on living spaces could be problematic.
In the open landscape, the final route was planned for 25 meters.
HS2 also plans to identify three options for a large-scale high-speed network leading north.
Lord Adonis will answer in the spring.
The preferred option is a Y-shaped configuration, where one high-speed track should lead to Western Midland.
The track should be divided near Birmingham with one branch, passing from Pennines to Manchester and Scotland, and the other, leading northeast to Sheffield, Leeds and Newcastle upon Tyne.
One route leads to Scotland.
"It seems that the most powerful choice has been made," said a railway expert.
Once completed, the driving time between London and Edinburgh will be shortened to two hours and 40 minutes.
The first phase, which will not be opened before 2025, could allow passengers to travel between London and Birmingham in 49 minutes compared to more than an hour in the present.
The proposals would allow trains to travel at a speed of 2,250 miles per hour, making the UK network the fastest in Europe.
The initial track is already being designed to take on 400m long trains capable of carrying 1,100 passengers.
Up to 18 sets could operate every hour on the London-Birmingham route.
This means that the London terminal would be able to serve up to 20,000 passengers per hour if needed.
Given capital constraints, the existing station is expected to be expanded to cover the high-speed network.
Experts from the railway industry say that only San Pancras International or Euston offer such potential.
Lord Adonis will announce whether or not he intends to implement this scheme, but extensive public consultations and planning procedures mean that no final decision will be made before the general elections.
Even if it puts the wheels in motion, the network should be built in parts.
The trains should first be put into service not on high-speed lines, but on already existing lines north of Birmingham, and maintain travel times between London and Scotland for more than three hours.
This is considered a crucial link to ensuring the transition from aircraft to trains, a landmark for the rail revolution.
Taxpayers paid a £75,000 mortgage on Tory Orange
Alan Duncan, the owner of the front seat of the Tory in the House of Representatives, was paid thousands of pounds last year by taxpayers for an orange factory he had built in his house in the electoral district.
A prison party spokesman, who was degraded by David Cameron for complaining that MPs lived “from allocations,” raised his mortgage to £75,000 to build an oak-shaped extension in his second home in Rutland.
He was allowed to charge a special interest, a total of hundreds of pounds per month to taxpayers.
The municipal authorities approved the claims on time, so he was not questioned by Sir Thomasen Legge, who was in charge of checking membership expenses. Last night Mr. Duncan stated his demands “it could have been cleaner or easier.”
Mr. Duncan, one of the wealthiest members of parliament, owns two two-storey villages in his electoral districts of Rutland and Melton.
The houses are worth approximately £1 million.
There is a kitchen, a living room and a dining room on the ground floor, but the tax office agreed that Mr. Duncan needed more space.
Last year he added a winter garden to the house, which is designated as "orange garden" in the plans.
Neighbors describe it as "a greenhouse for entertainment and hospitality".
Mr. Duncan was not asked to provide any explanation about the increased loan during the last inspection by the Committee on Common Standards and Privileges in the last mortgage settlement.
The committee told him last month that he had broken the rules, after reviewing his spending.
In 2004, Mr. Duncan changed his pupil security to a £271,1406 mortgage from his property in London to a house in his electoral district, which he bought in 1991, a year before becoming a member of the House.
Documents released this week showed that Mr. Duncan claimed approximately £1,400 a month in interest of a mortgage until March last year.
In April, his claims increased to more than £1,800 a month.
The interest in the repayments of Mr. Duncan’s RBS mortgage could not change at this time, suggesting that it was all intended to finance a loan of £75,000.
The standard variable RBS mortgage repayment declined in December 2007 from 7.94 percent to 4 percent in March this year, while remaining.
The latest document by municipal authorities shows that Mr. Duncan continued to claim £1,250 a month this May.
Mr. Duncan left his job as the shadow head of the House in September after a secret rapporteur filmed him and said MPs had to survive "on allocation" after a spending scandal.
“In principle, it’s nationalized, you have to live on assignment and you’re treated like a s**t.”
He said, “I spent money on my garden and claimed and a small fraction on what was needed.
And I could claim all that damn portion, but I won’t.”
The MP, a millionaire from a former career as a oil trader, was first asked to explain his releases in May when it turned out he claimed thousands of pounds for his garden, even before it was approved by the Treasury that it “could be considered excessive.”
One activist dug a pound-shaped pit in Mr. Duncan’s lawn to protest after it was revealed that he claimed £4,000 for three years.
When asked last night about raising the mortgage, Mr. Duncan said: "It was because of a capital increase, which was approved by both the Treasury Authority and subsequently Leggem."
He added: “This is not a question of hiding and crawling or breaking the rules or anything else.
It’s an absolutely straight line down, according to the rules, justified and that’s all.
This could not be much cleaner or simpler in many other ways.”
Come all look at the chat on the Brighton coast with the advent calendar.
The coastal chalets in Brighton have found a new meaning to life in the rising months as an interactive advent calendar.
Beyond, an alternative church group that encourages the Duke’s experience of creativity, has invited 24 owners to decorate their cottages for each day in December and to use Christmas wheels as the theme of this decoration.
The event began on 1 December, allowing visitors to view the last chat from 17.30 to 18.30 every day, and a bishop’s bread and boiled wine provided for free.
Selected colleges included I Saw Three Ships, O Come, O Come, Emmanuel and The First Noël, where the cottage featured the work of Janetta Tozer, a local artist.
Martin Poole, 50, an assistant in television marketing from Hove, is a non-stipended priest in the Chichester diocese and the leader of Beyonce.
He said: “We want to make religion much more important for people in a post-Christian society.
"Why should we as a church expect people to come into a foreign old building?I feel that the church should come to people and serve in an awakening way.
“The idea of the advent calendar in the cottage came from a conversation with some friends during dinner.
Brighton is such a fantasticly creative and vibrant place and we have tried to try and present it in a spiritual way."
Strong mobilization in Copenhagen and around the world against climate change.
Tens of thousands of people took to the streets on Saturday to demand a strong and binding agreement to fight global warming, which should be adopted at the conference in Copenhagen, demonstrated around the world, including in Copenhagen, where police arrested hundreds of people on the occasion.
At least 30,000 people, according to police sources, and 100,000 according to organizers, demonstrated in the cold weather in the Danish capital on the occasion of the UN climate conference, which aims to adopt the agreement by Friday, which could enter into force on January 1, 2013.
Connie Hedegaard, the Danish president of the climate conference, said the growing global mobilization, clearly demonstrated by the current demonstrations, has contributed to the fact that the “political tax” of a possible failure in Copenhagen would be too high.
The incidents occurred in the Danish capital shortly after the start of the parade, when a group of about 300 demonstrators, dressed in black, began to break the outlets with tiles and hammer.
The police immediately intervened vigorously.
Police have the arrests of between 600 and 700 people and have specified that they were members of the "Blacks Blocks", an ultra-radical separatist group that appeared in April at the NATO summit in Strasbourg, in eastern France.
The Coalition Climate Justice Action (CJA), one of the organizers of the event, condemned the conditions under which hundreds of radicals were arrested "without distinction" and stressed that about a hundred of them were held in bonds and seats "held in the streets on Saturday night" despite the extreme winter.
After leaving Parliament, the parade quietly headed to the Bella Center, where the negotiations were taking place.
The protesters stopped about 500 meters from the building without trying to penetrate.
For the speakers, a podium was built before which a spiritual meeting at candles was held with the participation of former South African Archbishop of Cape Town, Desmond Tutu.
Most of the protesters arrived by bus and train from major European cities, and in addition to Africans, there were also a large number of participants from Asia, including a few Chinese and Koreans.
Nearly 3,000 people, mostly dressed in blue coats, formed the first gathering in Copenhagen in the morning, at the call of the Friends of the Earth group, which wanted to create "blue waves" for a "just climate".
Today we go to the streets to demand the settlement of ecological debt in favor of the South, explained Lidy Nacpil, a Filipino fighter from the Jubilee South Coalition in Copenhagen.
We can’t say anymore: it’s time, said Benin singer Angelique Kidjo.
In Africa, rivers and water streams are drying, and today we can walk in them and this has never been possible before.
For the first time in the history of climate diplomacy, which was born in 1992 with the adoption of the UN Convention, the struggle for another world movement approached environmental organizations.
French MEP José Bové, one of the figures of the struggle for another world, said he came to Copenhagen with the aim of "connecting climate and social justice". "At the moment there is no difference between fighting global warming and fighting for another world."
The first demonstrations began in the Asia-Pacific region, where many islands are sensitive to climate warming.
About 50,000 people took to the streets in Australia, according to organizers.
In Manila, several hundred people marched, mostly students, in red clothes and shorts evoking the importance of solar energy.
Hundreds of protesters in Hong Kong, Jakarta and Canada have rushed to the streets demanding action against climate change.
In France, hundreds of people took part in the protests organized by the "350" movement, mainly in Paris, Marseille (south), Lille (north), Bordeaux (west) and Lyon (east).
Dozens of people gathered in Geneva.
Separatist Abkhazia has elected its president, Georgia condemns it as a "fragma"
Abkhazia elected its president on Saturday, approximately a year after Moscow recognized this pro-Russian separatist territory as independent from Georgia, while Tbilisi, on the other hand, declared the move a "fragment".
About 13,000 people were invited to participate in these first elections after the Russian-Georgian war in August 2008 for control of South Ossetia, another former Georgian territory recognized by Russia.
The polling stations closed at 17:00 GMT.
According to officials of the Abkhazian Election Commission, the participation was 58% a few hours before the closure of the polling stations.
The first preliminary results will be announced on Saturday night.
All five candidates, including the current president Sergei Bagapsh, categorically reject the idea of merger with Georgia, which condemned the elections.
These elections are a farce.
On the other hand, Georgian President Mikhail Saakashvili "regrets that Abkhazia has completely fallen under Russian rule," said his spokeswoman, Manana Manjgaladze.
In addition to Russia, only Nicaragua and Venezuela have recognized the independence of this territory with 216,000 inhabitants, while the rest of the world considers it to be part of Georgia, which has been illegally occupied by Russian troops.
After the separation from Georgia, after the conflict in 1992-1993, which killed several thousand people, Abkhazia is trying to show through elections that it is ready to return to international politics.
This process is one of the stages of our new life, a new era of our independent state, said Kvarcja Svetlan, a 54-year-old historian who also admitted to voting for President Bagapsh.
She was one of those who came to vote in the polling room at a school in the capital Suchumi, into a beautiful white building with a few palm trees at the entrance.
The question of Russian domination is the main theme of the presidential elections in this region on the shore of the Black Sea, which boasts magnificent nature.
Thro this small country of 216,000 inhabitants, huge billboards with Bagapsh are displayed alongside Russian President Dmitry Medvedev and Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin.
In Gali, in the western part of the country, Russian officials who came to oversee the successful run of the elections were welcomed warmly by district mayor Beslan Arshba.
"We Abkhazians are grateful," he said at a small ceremony, having in mind the support of Moscow and in particular its decision to recognize the independence of Abkhazia.
I hope that your country will soon be recognized by the United Nations, Aleksei Ostrovsky, a member of the Russian parliament, said, drinking a glass of vodka.
The opposition, which was represented in the elections by former vice president Raul Khadzhima and two businessmen Zaus Ardzinba and Beslan Boutba, criticized last year’s agreements with Moscow, such as a deal that allows Russia to control Abkhazia’s rail network for 10 years.
The fifth candidate, Vitali Bganba, says he does not support either the current government or the opposition.
A 50% majority plus one vote is required to win the election.
If none of the candidates achieves this result, the decisive match must take place within two weeks.
Climate: demonstrations in the world, events in Copenhagen
Tens of thousands of people took to the streets on Saturday to demand a strong and binding agreement to fight global warming, which should be adopted at the conference in Copenhagen, demonstrated around the world, including in Copenhagen, where police arrested around 700 people on that occasion.
At least 30,000 people, according to police sources, and 100,000 according to organizers, demonstrated in the cold afternoon in the Danish capital, which is hosted until December 18 by delegates from 193 countries, negotiating an agreement that could enter into force on January 1, 2013.
After leaving Parliament, the parade quietly headed to the Bella Center, where the negotiations were taking place.
The protesters stopped about 500 meters from the building without trying to penetrate.
For the speakers, a podium was built before which a spiritual meeting at candles was held with the participation of former South African Archbishop of Cape Town, Desmond Tutu.
The incidents occurred shortly after the parade left, when a group of several hundred protesters, dressed in black and armed with bricks and hamsters, began to break the outlets.
The police immediately surrounded them and intercepted them without waiting, shooting several protesters to the ground.
Police have the arrests of between 600 and 700 people and have specified that they were members of the "Blacks Blocks", an ultra-radical separatist group that appeared in April at the NATO summit in Strasbourg, in eastern France.
Late in the afternoon, a police officer was wounded by a squat and four cars were set on fire near the squat located near the incidents, which resulted in the detention of about 20 people, according to police sources.
We are focusing on extremist groups, police spokesman Henrik Jakobsen warned as police helicopters flew into the air again.
Most of the protesters who arrived by bus or train from major German cities such as London, Amsterdam and Milan were of European origin.
But there were also a lot of Asians, including a few Chinese and Koreans or Africans.
Nearly 3,000 people, mostly dressed in blue coats, formed the first gathering in Copenhagen in the morning at the call of the Friends of the Earth group, which wanted to create "blue waves" for "a just climate".

French MEP José Bové, one of the figures of the struggle for another world, said he came to Copenhagen with the aim of "connecting climate and social justice". "At the moment there is no difference between fighting global warming and fighting for another world."
Oxfam has invited several prominent figures, such as Danish model Helen Christensen and former UN refugee commissioner Mary Robinson, to speak to the crowd.
The first demonstrations began in the Asia-Pacific region, where many islands are sensitive to climate warming.
About 50,000 people took to the streets in Australia, according to organizers.
In Manila, several hundred people demonstrated in front of the city hall of the capital of the Philippines, mostly students in red clothes and with shirts evoking the importance of solar energy.
Hundreds of demonstrators also gathered in Hong Kong and Jakarta to call for action against climate change.
In France, hundreds of people took part in the protests organized by the "350" movement, mainly in Paris, Marseille (south), Lille (north), Bordeaux (west) and Lyon (east).

Geography and history subjects will be strengthened as part of the general school reform, Chatel said.
Education Minister Luc Chatel said on Sunday during an interview with JDD magazine that the subjects of history and geography will be "strengthened" within the framework of the reform of the general gymnasiums, although their teaching will no longer be mandatory in the last year of the gymnasium with a focus on exact sciences.
Now all second-year students will have four hours a week and the same general culture program will be available for all, Chatel confirmed.
According to the minister, "it is necessary to end the hypocrisy", because according to him, the specialization S is no longer focused on exact sciences" but "in essence there are the best students in it".
Specialization ES and L can’t be for S some kind of sub-specialization, he continues and emphasizes: “I haven’t heard many historians and intellectuals bothering themselves not to learn geography and history in the last year of the professional gymnasiums.”
Ifop’s poll, published by the daily Humanité on Saturday, showed that seven Frenchmen out of ten (69%) disagree with the government’s project to abolish compulsory teaching of history and geography in the graduate year with specialization S, which is why many intellectuals and teachers have criticized the abolition, both the left and some lawmakers.
The minister, on the other hand, added that it "does not come into consideration" to cancel the philosophy in the specialization program of the graduate year.
Luc Chatel defended the reform of teachers’ education, while 16 organizations (students and trade unions) called for participation in Tuesday’s mobilization against the project, which, according to them, sacrifices the pedagogical education of future high school professors.
As part of Master 2 (M2), they will undergo an admission test focused on their field at the beginning of the year and a further exam at the end of the year to verify their ability to teach, the Minister explained.
They will take part in professional internships during the second year of master’s studies and in the first year they will perform in front of students as a professor-internship.
If you sum up all the internships that will be offered to you before the admission process, you will gain more student experience, 300 hours, he continued.
The minister also announced that he would propose a “personal right to education”, which is not yet in the national education system.
He reaffirmed the project to abolish the school map by 2012.
At the elite École normale supérieure, experts have 15 minutes to convince about the climate.
Fifteen minutes to present the objectives of the Copenhagen Summit: this is the challenge announced in the council morning by Jean Jouzel, vice-president of the Intergovernmental Panel of Experts on Climate Development (GIEC) at the initiative of the Ecole normale supérieure University on Ulm Street.
As a reporter told AFP, Nobel Peace Prize laureate Jean Jouzel opened the first of the "Ernest" conferences, a kind of one-day seminar consisting of fifteen-minute contributions from experts, which will be filmed and open to the public.
We wanted to do something that would attract people and give them a greater desire to learn something more, explained Edouard Hannezo, 22, one of the organizers of this seminar, named after a fish from a local lake named by the students.
About a dozen contributing experts from each scientific discipline will be selected and it will be clarified that the selection is based on their charisma.
"We can talk for hours about climate warming, but we can also summarize the basic goals in a few minutes," Jean Jouzel, who spoke to fifty listeners without pre-prepared comments, only using charts, told AFP.
It is part of our scientific work, he stressed with the hope that listeners will realize that "the Copenhagen conference is based on very seriously prepared scientific foundations".
Videos taken at these lectures will be posted on the school’s website from 15 December.
The next "Ernest" seminar is scheduled for February and another will follow with a regularity every two months.
Delayed payments: angry prison guards, planned measures
The prison guards’ unions announced a “general mobilization” on Friday, demanding premium payments and overtime payments for Christmas holidays, which were postponed to January for financial reasons.
The prison FO (the 2nd union of supervisors) asked employees who would not be on duty to participate in a demonstration held on Tuesday morning in front of prison facilities and to “block them” to alert them to “theft of their wages.”
The CGT for prison guards (the 3rd trade unions of this sector) called on them to “call up gatherings in individual prisons and start a major mobilization” saying it was “shameful and unacceptable” that “overtime and surcharges for night work, on Sundays and holidays” worked in October were not paid in December.
The first union of supervisors, the Federal Union of Prison Supervisors (Ufap/Unsa), “calls for general mobilization (...) in order to show dissatisfaction and indignation.”
The Administrative Directorate and the Ministry of Justice explain that the number of overtime has increased considerably in 2009 and not all of them have been included in the financial budget, but they assure that the amounts owed will be paid in January.
The chancellor said at the end of the day that Michèle Alliot-Mari had sent a notice to the prison guards unions assuring them that the payment would be made next month.
“I am aware of the efforts that prison personnel are making to ensure the functioning and modernization of our prison system,” she said in a statement.
I ordered the administration of prisons to take immediate measures to ensure that the situation resulting from a poor assessment of overtime will never be repeated in the future, Minister Alliot-Mari added.
The December salary will therefore be low, with the exception of managers who receive famous premiums for performing functions and fulfilling goals, Ufap/Unsa says, and for those "there will always be a place in the budget."
It is simply a scandal, the interregional union of FO in Marseille has outraged and announced its decision to boycott until the cancellation of "all meetings and calls".
Employees will not come to work on Sundays or holidays if they are not paid in December for these days from the month of October, as well as overtime, also threatens FO Rhône-Alpes-Auvergne.
At a time when they give us more and more work and more tasks without providing us with additional staff, it is sad to allow the lowest-ranking staff to pay for it, the CGT-prison guards in Bordeaux say.
According to the unions, the situation is not the same in all regions, some are better off than others.
However, in any case, the funds are very few, noted Ufap Secretary General, Jean-François Forget.
Obama says he gives “better gifts” than he receives
U.S. President Barack Obama, who is preparing for his first Christmas with his family at the White House, confided to the screen "goddess" Oprah Winfrey that when it comes to gifts, there is a simple rule: "I give better gifts than those I get."
The president and his wife Michelle spoke in a special edition of the show, which will be broadcast on Sunday evening on ABC, about how they are about to spend the Christmas holidays and the end of the year in their new and prestigious residence.
Even Bo, a small four-legged companion of the family, will get his pearl.
Jesus also loves Boa, Michelle Obama said, saying the dog will also "of course" receive a gift, according to excerpts from the program's preliminary broadcast.
And Michelle Obama also rejected her husband’s assertions about the quality of the gifts she receives: “That’s definitely not, I gave you prima gifts last year.”
Of course, he was forced to agree, but immediately afterward, with humor, he pointed his finger to the first lady’s pearl collar: “And who gave you this?”
During this one-hour very relaxed show with the famous host who worked hard to support Barack Obama in his presidential campaign, the spouses also talked to Obama about their most unloved gifts they received as children.
Barack Obama said he had a 10-speed bike, but also a basketball ball given to him on Christmas by his Kenyan father, whom he rarely encountered.
I remember seeing my father who came to see us at Christmas and gave me the basketball.
After a long time, I realized that the ball was actually given to me.
The first lady remembered the doll house.
I didn’t know how to organize everything in the house so I aligned all the furniture along the wall instead of placing it around the fireplace, but I loved that little doll house,” Michelle Obama recalled.
Johnny Hallyday re-operated, RTL reports he is in artificial sleep
Johnny Hallyday was re-operated in Los Angeles for "injury" after a major surgery he had undergone in France, but the situation is "under control" according to his relatives, while RTL said the singer was in artificial sleep to avoid pain and complications.
The 66-year-old rocker was re-operated in the night of Wednesday to Thursday at the Cedars-Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles after U.S. doctors noted "injury resulting from surgery" on a scratched plate he had undergone in Paris on November 26, his press department said in Paris, saying the lesions required "reparative surgery".
The singer's press department, however, tried to calm the public, saying the situation was "under control" and at the same time announced that a new medical statement would be issued no later than within 48 hours.
According to RTL, which is the main partner of the singer’s last tour, Johnny Hallyday was put into artificial sleep to avoid “pain and complications.”
Within 48 hours, when the patient opens his eyes, we will be a little more confident.
The press department did not confirm or comment on the information.
RTL also that, according to "some sources", no drain was placed after the first operation in Paris.
Rocker was operated at the Parc Monceau International Clinic due to his outstretched platelet.
The operation, which was planned several days in advance, was performed by neurosurgeon Stephan Delajoux, a physician well-known in art circles.
But the doctor was not available on Thursday to comment on RTL’s information.
After this operation, singer Johnny Hallyday was hospitalized at Cedars-Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles on Monday for an infection that occurred after the intervention.
Singer Eddy Mitchell, a close friend of Johnny Hallyday, said on Thursday on RTL radio that his boyfriend is just going through a "bad period", but added that he "does not worry" about the rocker because he is a big "fighter".
He called me just before he left for Los Angeles, but I told him he was doing nonsense because spending 12 hours on the plane after such an operation was not fun, Eddy Mitchell said.
On Wednesday evening, producer Jean-Claude Camus calmed the situation, saying that Johnny Hallyday "reacts well to antibiotics" and that the infection was "stopped".
Mr. Camus also said he met Laetitia, the singer’s wife, and that he did not notice any special concerns.
The singer’s health problems have only multiplied since he was hospitalized in July for nine days after falling on his yacht.
Two months later, to everyone’s surprise, it was revealed that Johnny Hallyday had been operated on a “small colon tumor” and then on a weak infection.
At the end of September, the singer returned to his long tour "Tower 66", which is presented as his farewell.
But since then, each of his health problems has been heavily monitored and commented on. Fans and journalists have noticed that the singer has difficulty moving on stage.
In mid-November, his team had to deny the news of a new hospitalization.
Euro 2009/Little Swimming Pool: Bousquet premiere in his favorite discipline
Frenchman Frédérick Bousquet, a three-time medalist at the 2009 World Championship in big pool, won the title at the 2009 European Championship in small pool in Istanbul on Thursday in a discipline he loves: 50m free way.
On the first day of the championship, where the last time dresses were allowed, only three world records were broken, although much more were expected.
One of them was overtaken by the Hungarian racer Evelyn Verrasztová in the 200m position race and the remaining two men's squad of Russia in the 4x50m position race.
A great sadness for Bousqueta, who made a stumbling on the world record on 50 m free, which he is already holding in a large pool (20,94).
In one of the two royal disciplines of swimming, 50m free mode, the 28-year-old Frenchman won with a final time of 20.53 seconds in the final, at which 10 swimmers first kicked off instead of the usual eight.
Bousquet defeated Croatian Duje Draganja (20.70) and Russian Sergei Fesikov (20.84), but failed to break the world record (20.30), as he expected.
We can always dream of something better, but I have said that if the world record is within my reach, I will try it.
Like Bousquet, almost all swimmers were wearing polyurethane swimsuits, which will be banned from January 1.
The uniforms have contributed to 238 world records since February 2008 and their era ends in Istanbul, which was the first to host the same competition in 1999.
The use of the swimsuit this time did not help even the German Paul Biedermann, a double world champion in a large pool in Rome in the summer, who had a world record at hand.
The young swimmer failed to beat the record, which he holds on 400 meters (3:32.77), but still won with the second fastest time in his career (3:34.55), ahead of Russian racer Nikita Lobintseva (3:35.75) and Dan Mads Glaesner (3:36.82)
I didn’t give it all in the race.
I knew I would not beat the world record this time, but I managed to defend my title and I accomplished my task.
Lobintsev will be a serious opponent in the future, Biedermann explained.
U.S. album of Roman sarcophagus belonging to Zola sold for $1.5 million
The album of the romantic sarcophagus, which belonged to nobody but French writer Emile Zola, was auctioned for $1.5 million on Thursday, significantly more than previously estimated, Sotheby’s said.
The price of this two meters long and 63 cm tall front plate, dating from the third century AD, was estimated at $150,000 to $250,000.
The marble “representing four Dionysian scenes in a sophisticated architectural decor surrounded by satyrs and bakchants is a rare work, there are very few such pieces in the world, four or five,” said Florent Heintz, Sotheby’s Vice President of the auction of ancient Roman and Egyptian art.
It was sold among hundreds of others.
The sale is still ongoing, but it’s the item that has probably been hit the most, Sotheby’s spokesman Dan Abernethy told AFP.
That Emile Zola bought this marble was discovered a few days ago.
The disc was in Rome for almost 300 years in the famous collection of the Borgi family and then gradually appeared with French actress Cecile Sorel, who decorated her bathroom in her private hotel in Paris, and with Paul Reynaud, Minister of the Third Republic in France and briefly Chairman of the Council before Marshal Petain came to power.
It remained hidden for about fifty years.
Florent Heintz discovered, while scanning the Louvre Museum database, that this plate was part of the "remnants of Emile Zola" opened since 1903, a year after the death of the author "Therese Raquin" and the fresco "Rougon-Macquart".
The interrupted attempt to move President Zelaya from Honduras to Mexico.
Mexico on Thursday ruled that the conditions for the transfer of Honduras’s ousted president, Manuel Zelaya, were not met, after the insurgents refused to give him a guarantee of safe departure.
“After the phone conversation I had with President Zelaya last night, everything indicates that there is no way to do this transfer,” said the Mexican Foreign Minister, Patricia Espinos.
A Mexican government plane that arrived in El Salvador on Wednesday for President Zelaya has flown back, a source from the Directorate-General for Migration said.
The coupist government wanted to force President Zelaya to resign and apply for political asylum abroad, only to provide him with a safe departure.
But the ousted president rejected these demands because he wanted to go to Mexico as the exile head of the state.
The coupist government "has experienced another failure when it wanted me to resign (...), they wanted me to resign," Zelaya told Radio Globo on Thursday, often speaking about the political crisis that has been ongoing in this Central American country for five months.
“I can stay here for ten years, I have my guitar here,” added the overthrown president, hiding at the Brazilian embassy in Tegucigalpa for two and a half months and playing a few chords.
The embassy of Mexico has asked us to provide a guarantee for safe transport, but unfortunately we cannot accept it because it does not contain an application for asylum, Interior Minister Oscar Raul Matute told HRN on Wednesday.
"I will not seek asylum from any country," Zelaya said in an interview with Caracas-based Telesur.
If I ever leave Honduras, I will leave as the president of the Honduran people.
Rumors of Zelayi's departure mobilized on Wednesday supporters of the ousted president who came to gather around the Brazilian embassy, where the army strengthened protection.
Brazil’s foreign minister, Celso Amorim, has criticized the coup government.
They demonstrate their marginalized attitude to international standards, he added.
Zelaya, who was close to Venezuela’s socialist president Hugo Chávez, was overthrown on June 28, the day he organized public consultations in preparation for his re-election against the recommendations of the Supreme Court, the military and Congress.
He returned from exile in Costa Rica unexpectedly on September 21 and found refuge at the Brazilian embassy.
If he goes out, he will be arrested and will be held accountable for the crime of “tradition” he is accused of, the coup government says.
President Roberto Micheletti held presidential elections on November 29 to replace President Zelaya.
In controversial elections, recognized by the United States but condemned by Latin American countries such as Venezuela, Argentina or Brazil, Porfirio Lobo won.
Three days later, Congress voted against President Zelaya's return to power until the end of his term on January 27.
Wall Street rises, U.S. trade balance boosts optimism
The New York Stock Exchange ended up rising on Thursday and the U.S. trade balance showed a rise in both the United States and its partners: the Dow Jones gained 0.67% and the Nasdaq 0.33%.
According to final data, the Dow Jones Industrial Average improved from 68.78 points to 10.405.83, and the Nasdaq, with technological dominance from 7.13 points to 2190,06 points.
The Standard & Poor's 500 index improved by 0.8% (6.40 points) to 1102.35 points.
We have good news coming from different parts of the economy, said Lindsey Piegz of FTN Financial.
But we can’t take it too seriously, she added, because the market is focused on “half-full glass.”
For Peter Cardillo of Avalon Partners, investors focus primarily on U.S. trade balance figures, “which show that activity is improving in the fourth quarter.”
The U.S. trade deficit fell by 7.6% from September to $32.9 billion in October.
Analysts expected the deficit to rise.
Both imports and exports increased.
The big news is the growing volume of trade, especially goods exports, reflecting the growth of the economies of the major trading partners of the United States, said Christopher Cornell of the research firm Economy.com.
However, in the United States last week unemployment rose against all expectations and the number of job seekers reached 474,000.
But over the past four weeks, the average number of new job seekers has fallen "to the lowest this year," said Scott Marcouiller of Wells Fargo Advisors.
The stock market has also declined.
The 10 year outlook treasury yield rose to 3.482% from 3.423% on Tuesday evening, and the 30 year output rose to 4.492% from 4.408% the day before.
Cuba: Hundreds of supporters of the regime shout out "Ladies in White"
Several hundred supporters of the Cuban regime kicked out the wives of political prisoners who gathered in Havana on World Human Rights Day on Thursday and prevented another demonstration at which dozens of dissidents were arrested.
About forty "Dams in White", wives or close political prisoners were sprinkled directly on the street by the supporters of the regime of Raul Castro as they marched towards the center of the capital demanding the release of political prisoners, the journalist.
Away with the Yankees!, "The mercenaries!", "The streets belong to the revolutionaries!", "Long live Fidel and Raul!" scanded with their fists raised by the regime supporters on the dissidents.
The dissidents were eventually escorted by civilians who came "to ensure security".
The day before, there was a similar demonstration in Havana against "Ladies in White", but there were no injuries or arrests.
But in the Havanese neighborhood of Vedado, police detained in civilian custody about ten dissidents who were also planning to demonstrate on Thursday on the occasion of World Human Rights Day, a reporter told AFP.
According to the journalist, the police charged dissidents who were sprinkled into civilian vehicles by supporters of the government regime using force.
Arresting dissidents under similar conditions usually takes only a few hours.
The European Parliament’s 2005 Sakharov Prize winners, “Ladies in White,” organized an unauthorized march for “the release of all, according to dissent, about 200 political prisoners,” said one of their leaders, Laura Pollan, whose husband Héctor Maceda is serving a 20-year prison sentence.
Maceda is one of 75 Cuban dissidents arrested in March 2003, 53 of whom are still in custody.
The Cuban authorities consider the opponents to be “ mercenaries” or “agents” paid by their main enemy, the United States.
A miracle, Cuban television on Thursday’s rally of supporters of the government regime against “opponents of the revolution.”
Cuba, with the Communist Party at the forefront and a one-party government policy, is regularly accused by European or American NGOs of non-respecting human rights and freedoms, including freedom of speech.
A man with a knife killed an eighty-year-old man and wounded five people in Clichy-la-Garenne.
A man armed with two knives killed an eighty-year-old man and wounded five others in the town of Clichy-la-Garenne (Hauts-de-Seine) during peak hours on Thursday afternoon.
According to preliminary results of the investigation, the 28-year-old allegedly attacked with two knives and for unknown reasons an eighty-year-old man in or in front of the pharmacy, at 85 Boulevard Jean-Jaures, such is the version of the police and witnesses.
A seriously injured old man, born in 1929, died in a hospital from injuries, according to the police syndicate Alliance.
In this pharmacy or in front of it then the attacker attacked a pregnant woman and her partner.
The man at the age of thirty began to defend himself and was injured.
The first two seriously injured victims were taken to the same hospital in which the 80-year-old man died.
The life of the second injured person is in danger, according to police sources, vital organs were apparently hit.
The pregnant woman then collapsed and was taken to the hospital "in shock," a police source said.
The armed man, who was apparently under the influence of alcohol or drugs, according to a police source, then fled into the street, still on boulevard Jean Jaurès.
He injured two others, apparently by accident: a 30-year-old and a 40-year-old man, the other seriously.
It is unclear how this happened, as it all happened in the afternoon.
He was armed with two carcass knives, which he carried with a cross behind his back, Alliance leader in Hauts-de-Seine, Arnaud Pressé, said on the spot.
Several passers, including young people, tried to stop the madman and disarm him, according to AFP testimony.
I saw a 30-year-old boy in a green jacket.
Three men tried to catch him.
They failed because he was quite strong, Alberto, a waitress from a nearby bar, commented on the situation.
A crowd, including a city policeman, broke his wrist, he added.
Still on Boulevard Jean-Jaures, at level 61, two city policemen, including their commander, attempted to arrest an armed man and were wounded in their fists, a police source said.
The incident occurred on one of the main streets in Clichy-la-Garenne, where many shops are located.
The police said there was a wounded person outside.
I went out and saw a seventy-year-old man on the ground, put him in a safe place and noticed large wounds on my stomach, Frederic Allione, a thirty-five-year-old pharmacist, told AFP.
Five minutes later, another 30-year-old man arrived, who was also wounded with a knife.
The man, who had no identity documents, was arrested by police.
The Attorney General of Nanterre referred the case to the Hauts-de-Seine District Police Investigation Unit (SDPJ 92).
The suspect was taken to hospital on Thursday night.
He is in custody and awaits interrogation.
The police did not rule out his placement in a psychiatric clinic.
Another police source said it took six policemen to handle him at the Clichy police station, where he was taken.
He was "completely out of his own" as "all the madmen of this type, whose power increases tenfold in action".
US: Polanski's lawyer calls for termination of criminal prosecution
The lawyer of Polish-French filmmaker Roman Polanski again requested on Thursday in Los Angeles (California, western United States) to stop the criminal prosecution against his client, who is currently in his Swiss residence over a moral affair that occurred thirty years ago.
Chad Hummel, a lawyer for the director of the film "The Pianist", criticized before three judges of the Second District Court of Appeal in California the serious errors that occurred during the trial at the time of the events in 1977.
I demand that the prosecution be stopped now and immediately, Hummel said, adding that from the behavior of the judge who then ruled the case, Laurence Rittenbanda "had a freeze in his back".
According to him, the judge (who had already died in the meantime) had allegedly dealt with the prosecutor before the verdict was pronounced, who told him that Roman Polanski deserved to go to jail – a serious offence against the rule of law.
Information about this interview appeared in the documentary "Roman Polanski: wanted and desired" (Roman Polanski, sought and sought), from the mouth of the prosecutor himself, David Wells.
But Mr. Wells eventually stated at the end of September that he had "lied" to the author of the document.
If the court refuses to halt the criminal proceedings, Hummel’s lawyer will request a hearing in which he will be able to provide evidence for his claims.
The plaintiff repeated what had already been said in the first state case, namely that there would be no serious examination of the request to stop the prosecution until Roman Polanski appeared before the court.
The 76-year-old director fled the United States in 1978, before a court ruled he had “illegal sexual intercourse” with a 13-year-old girl.
Since then, he has never re-entered the United States.
Deputy Los Angeles prosecutor Phyllis Asayam said Roman Polanski "should be there to attend the trial."
In this case, we want to tell not only Romana Polaski, but also other defendants that it is possible to escape.
He is of the opinion that the director “requests a favor from the court and at the same time despises his authority.”
One of the three judges, who now have 90 days to make a decision, also stressed that “there are other alternatives to escape.”
Hummel’s lawyer was not the only one to call for the termination of the criminal prosecution against Roman Polanski.
The victim’s attorney, Samanthy Geimer, has also called for the termination of the criminal proceedings.
She recalled that her client will no longer endure that eternal harassment every time the Polanski case arises, adding: "Nobody in this room can say that the trial was fair."
Thirty years is enough.”
Roman Polanski was arrested on September 26 in Switzerland.
After more than two months in prison, he was released to house arrest in his Gstaad cottage, where he is waiting for his eventual release.
Wall Street ends without direction, blocked by rising dollar
The New York Stock Exchange ended on Friday without direction, the market melting between indicators that are better than expected in the U.S. and rising dollar price: the Dow Jones gained +0.63%, but the Nasdaq lost 0.03%.
According to data from the final closing date, the Dow Jones Industrial Average advanced from 65.67 points to 10.471.50 points and the Nasdaq, with technological dominance left 0.55 points and ended at 2.190.31 points.
The Standard & Poor's 500 index rose from 0.37% (4.06 points) to 1.106.41 points.
Honestly, the market is very calm, said Mace Blicksilver of Marblehead Asset Management.
It remains in a narrow range, the volume of trade has decreased considerably and I think it will remain so until the end of the year.
This trend has also been confirmed by the publication of economic indicators that are better than expected and that “have helped improve the market mood in terms of the stability of the economic recovery,” said analyst Charles Schwab.
In the U.S., retail sales grew by 1.3% in November for the second consecutive month and far more than expected.
According to a preliminary estimate from the University of Michigan Index, U.S. consumer confidence has also returned, rising to 73.4 in December from 67.4 in the previous month.
Indexes, however, have been stopped by a new rise in the price of the dollar against the euro, which is the highest in the last two months, “pushing down sectors sensitive to the economic situation,” said Owen Fitzpatrick of Deutsche Bank.
Technology is losing ground under its feet.
The securities market has declined.
With a 10-year outlook, the treasury’s yield rose to 3,540% from 3,482% on Wednesday evening and, with a 30-year outlook, increased to 4,497% from 4,492% a day earlier.
Miss World in South Africa.
After a month's trip across South Africa, 112 Miss World candidates are about to cross their goal to their dream: to be elected the most beautiful woman in the world before a billion television viewers.
This great celebration of beauty has been held in the area of Johannesburg for the second year, and so far five candidates have gained progress to the semi-finals.
Miss Japan Eruza Sasaki, Perla Beltran Acosta from Mexico, Mariatu Kargbo from Sierra Leone, Kaiane Aldorino from Gilbratar and Yanbing Ma from Canada were elected Miss Sport or Miss Top Model during their African stay.
It was a real spell of events.
It was amazing to visit beautiful cities like Port Elizabeth,Durban or Cape Town.
I’ve seen a lot of things and I’ve had so many experiences!”, Miss Sierra Leone confided.
The competition, which is held in South Africa for the ninth time, will be broadcast live from Midrand, northern Johannesburg, from 5 p.m.
I could not have dreamed of a more beautiful country in which I would put my crown.
It was a fascinating experience.
“I’m happy to be able to experience it twice,” said Miss World Ksenia Sukhin in a hot southern summer.
For a young Russian, her second stay in South Africa was carried out in the spirit of numerous meetings with other candidates and a new discovery of the country and its "breathtaking country".
After a month of performances, trials, press meetings and safari, Miss now focuses on the competition itself.
India's Pooja Chopra hopes to follow in the footsteps of Priyanka Chopra, elected in 2000, who also participated in the election, and Aishwarya Rai, the 1994 winner, both of whom became Bollywood stars.
Being crowned the most beautiful woman in the world is the dream of every woman, but it’s not just about appearance.
“We are the ambassadors of our countries and I want to go home with the crown,” Miss India said with a wide smile.
According to the organizers, the 59th anniversary will be carried out in the spirit of music and dance.
The candidates will be presented in traditional costumes and, of course, in swimsuits.
The show will be hosted by Chinese TV host Angela Chow, former South African beauty queen Michelle McLean and Miss World Committee Chairman Steve Douglas.
South Africa has shown that it can welcome the world with a warmth that is difficult to cope with, said Julia Morley, president of the Miss World competition.
As last year, the candidates took part in a safari, visited the famous town of Soweto, this time by bicycle, and tasted the local cuisine.
A special event was a meeting with South African President Jacob Zuma, who shrugged their hands.
For the president unusual, noted Miss Sierra Leone.
Undoubtedly, the most beautiful memory will remain the Cape Town draw (in the southwest of the country) for the World Cup, which will be held in June 2010, and which helped the country to support the event a little more.
I could meet people I didn’t even dream of.
“I’m sure I’ll be back at the 2010 World Cup,” said Miss Italy Alice Taticchi.
According to David’s son, the reports on Hallyday’s condition are “very positive.”
The news of Johnny Halliday’s condition is “very positive,” as his son David assured us when he arrived at the Los Angeles airport on Friday to visit his father, who has been hospitalized for several days.
The news is very positive.
“He’s very strong and everything is going very well,” David Hallyday said when he pulled out of his plane from Paris shortly after 13 a.m. local time.
The singer's son, who acted quietly, said he would arrive "as soon as possible" at the Los Angeles Cedars-Sinaï Hospital, where John Hallyday was admitted on Monday due to a post-operative infection resulting from an operation on the intervertebral platelets he underwent on November 26 in Paris.
According to a press release, he was "introduced to artificial sleep" in Los Angeles for convenience, to prevent pain and facilitate treatment.
Johnny Hallyday was hospitalized in an artificial sleep by doctors at the Cedars-Sinaï Hospital in Los Angeles due to an infection after surgery on the intervertebral platelets carried out on November 26 in Paris.
Due to serious injuries caused by this intervention, the singer had to be operated again in the night of Wednesday to Thursday.
According to AFP, his wife Laeticia attended a school performance at a French lyceum in Los Angeles on Friday morning, attended by their daughter Jade.
The head of the department of orthopedic surgery and traumatology at the Pitié-Salpêtrière Hospital, Yves Catoné, announced that he will travel to Los Angeles on Monday.
The producer harshly accused Dr. Stéphane Delajoux, a neurosurgeon who operated the singer on November 26 at the Clinique internationale du parc Monceau in Paris.
They said it was a massacre.
Surgeons in Los Angeles said they were outraged, Camus said.
I heard about the possibility of a future trial, he said.
Jean-Claude Camus believes that Johnny Hallyday "left too fast to Los Angeles with the permission of his Paris surgeon."
I personally spoke to the doctor by telephone and he assured me that this path was no problem, which greatly surprised me, since I myself had already suffered from intervertebral platelectomy twice, he added.
A moment earlier on the RTL radio station he said that the singer apparently flew away after the Paris operation without a drain, without anything.
Dr. Stéphane Delajoux is well known in the art circles.
He operated actress Maria Trintignant in Vilnius a few days before her death at the clinic in Neuilly-sur-Seine, where he worked at the time.
In 2007, he also operated actress Charlotte Gainsbourg to remove a hematoma caused by a bleeding into the brain.
However, he is also a doctor with a dark reputation, several times convicted in cases of neglect of medical care, for tax evasion and fraud.
Medical Chamber lawyer Olivier Metzner described him as a “man without scruples” who is “regularly” summoned to the medical chamber, and who can’t even be “recommended.”
After several days of silence, Dr. Stéphane Delajoux spoke through his lawyer, David Koubbi, on Friday.
He said the procedure was "absolutely good" and the post-operative examination was "normal".
The operation was not hemorrhagic in nature, so the introduction of a drain was not necessary," he added.
The singer’s health problems have increased since this summer, and in any case, it seems that his next tour remains questionable.
Obviously, the date for the resumption of the planned tour on January 8 (in Amiens) seems too close, Camus said.
The UDF raises the tone and calls on the Nouveau Centre party not to continue using their abbreviation.
The UDF, controlled by MoDem Francois Bayrou, on Friday responded to the attempt by the president of the Nouveau Centre party, Hervé Morin, to seize the abbreviation of the former Giscard party, saying it should not use the abbreviation in any media under the threat of criminal prosecution.
Hervé Morin publicly announced his intention to appropriate the abbreviation UDF with the claim that François Bayrou did not deserve to bear her inheritance after giving his hand to the left.
The defense minister, whose party is a partner of UMP, had planned to confirm this strategy on Saturday before the National Council of the Nouveau Centre (NC) movement.
His move gained support from MEP Hervé de Charetta (formerly UMP now NC), who attributes ownership of the UDF brand, since he was the first to register it with the National Institute of Industrial Property (l'Institut national de la propriété industrielle) in 2004.
But on Friday evening, a committee of the UDF Association led by friends of François Bayrou, who do not intend to be expropriated, withdrew from its silence and submitted a formal request to the minister and the MP to stop using the abbreviation and transfer back ownership of the trademark, under the threat of criminal prosecution.
In recent days, you have raised worrying statements about proposing to your political movement to “re-assume” the abbreviation UDF, the Association writes in a letter signed by 19 of the 24 members of the committee, including François Bayrou and Marielle de Sarnez from the MoDem, or Senator Jean Arthuis from the Alliance Centriste.
At the same time, you considered it appropriate to place on your promotional materials and on the welcome website of your movement the name+Nouveau centre+, with the slogan +UDF of today+, the signatories of the letter also stated.
As you know, you have no right to use this abbreviation, explains the UDF committee, which asks the NC movement to "immediately remove all mentions of the UDF name from all promotional materials including (its) websites".
At the same time, it asks Herve de Charette "to transfer the ownership of the trademark to the legitimate owners".
If you do not, we will turn to the courts to respect the law and the legitimate rights of UDF members.
In their letter, they state that the UDF "is a full-fledged political movement since 1978" and recall that Mr. Morin and his friends "choose" to leave in 2007, "to form a competitive movement, just like others in 2002, to found the UMP.
Therefore, according to them, the Nouveau centre movement has no right to use the abbreviation UDF (Union pour la démocratie française).
At the same time, they recall that the last UDF congress voted in 2007 for joining the MoDem for three years and for the creation of a committee tasked with defending the "moral and material interests" of the association founded by Valery Giscard d'Estaing.
As for Hervé de Charette, the committee continues, “when he registered a trademark,” he was “not a member of the UDF for three years,” but UMP.
In a scandalous and fraudulent way, he used the non-existent acronym registration to do so on his own account.
This intactivity begins to turn into a crime, they claim, and then with irony express to the NC strategy: "It seems to us that both in politics and in everyday life it is more valuable to create a name for ourselves than to step out of anonymity by fraudulent acceptance of a name to which we have no right."
The case of Liliane Bettencourt: François-Marie Banier will be tried for abusing the state of weakness.
A court in Nanterre on Friday ruled to prosecute the artist Francois-Marie Banier and to judge whether he had taken advantage of the 80-year-old billionaire’s weakness to take away a portion of her fortune, blamed on her daughter Liliane Bettencourt.
A photographer (62 years old), known for his photographs of celebrities, will be tried on 15 and 16 April 2010 for abusing the state of weakness, a crime for which a maximum sentence of 3 years and a fine of 375 000 euros is imposed.
This decision confirms that a trial will actually take place in a case that can be described as a family saga of one of the wealthiest families in France, in which mother and daughter attack each other and fight for control of the cosmetic empire L'Oréal.
However, the 15th criminal court also ordered the medical examination of 87-year-old Liliana Bettencourt to be carried out by a college of three doctors.
The heiress and main shareholder of L’Oréal has always refused to undergo such an investigation, not under the conditions offered by the Nanterre Prosecutor’s Office during the investigation.
Doctors who will be elected on Friday should prepare a report by 10 March 2010 and also submit comments on whether and during what period Liliana Bettencourt may have been in a state of weakness.
I think he will undergo it.
I will talk to her about the matter, Ms. Bettencourt’s lawyer, Georges Kiejman, said after the hearing.
Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers’ lawyer, Olivier Metzner, welcomed the court’s decision.
Expertise will show that with this old lady who needs protection, he manipulated (M. Banier), he confirmed.
It’s been two years since Liliana Bettencourt’s only daughter opened a criminal case against Francois-Marie Banier, a photographer and all-artist whom she blames for using her mother’s weakness for many years to make a donation of a billion euros in the form of checks, life insurance contracts or paintings of masters.
Liliane Bettencourt has always refused to be manipulated by a photographer she considers a longtime friend.
While the court had to assess the legitimacy of the lawsuit filed by Mrs. Bettencourt-Meyers, Friday’s court speech by lawyers turned into a family hour of truth.
Liliana Bettencourt’s lawyer submitted three letters, which his client (in 1999, 2003 and 2005) sent to her notary, in which she expressed her mistrust of husband Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers.
In a 2003 letter, Liliane Bettencourt said: “You could explain to my daughter that I have been writing to Banier for fifteen years, once or twice a day.
“Since she got married, I’ve never been able to talk to Francoise.”
The Nanterre Prosecutor’s Office again found that the complainant’s conduct was unjustified, especially since the custody judge in these days rejected her request to initiate proceedings to grant legal protection for her mother.
Liliane Bettencourt "is fully able to participate in the trial, not under protection or custody.
No one else will act for her,” prosecutor Marie-Christine Daubigney said.
The court finally decided to comment on the legitimacy of Mrs. Bettencourt-Meyers at the time of the opening of the proceedings.
Management revolution or the end of economic intelligence?
If nothing changes in the management of the great French companies, our struggle for the development of economic intelligence has been futile.
For more than a decade, the behavior of the management of large companies towards employees has been reminiscent of the approach of companies to consumers before the marketing revolution: it is about identifying employees with "values" determined from the top, as it was before when it was necessary to impose on consumers products that came from the ideas of the head of factory technicians.
By making the customer the center of business companies, the marketing revolution has compared the strategy of conquering the market in the right direction...even though authoritarian efforts to impose products different from customer preferences are coming back on a regular basis!
Passive employee attitude can lead to deadly demoralization.
Suicides in France Telecom, PSA or Renault are only a visible part of a much more widespread general phenomenon that mainly affects management.
This demobilization adversely affects the development of all intellectual functions of society, including research and development, and, more importantly, economic intelligence.
And indeed, EI “requires from all stakeholders (...) an active approach and the ability to predict” and demands from employees commitments that are entirely contrary to the revenue of authoritarian management.
Therefore, we call for a management revolution that aims to put employees at the center of the interests of the company as well as the client.
The relative usefulness of internal opinion polls.
Will internal polls – such as a questionnaire submitted to Orange employees – contribute to a revolution in management practices?
Unfortunately I fear that not.
Mainly because I have already convinced myself that in the face of a new situation, the structure, after different turns, will return preferably to what it has always done!
Furthermore, because authoritarianism, as one of the pathologies of power, increases in proportion to the severity of its own failures.
Finally, because most managers have a simplified view of human behavior.
Because they are university graduates for engineers, they have a mechanical interpretation of psychology.
Because of their convenience, they adopt an old behaviorist theory, now revived by US “neurosciences” and widely disseminated without any knowledge by scientific institutions and the media.
With the fact that it is possible to move the involvement of managers, a recent survey by Ipsos on the Figaro.fr website showed that managers are in a position of mechanical driving, unsuitable for today’s world.
Identify and measure mobilization factors.
On the contrary, the management revolution necessary for the proper functioning of modern enterprises implies the adoption of the ultimate vision of human behavior.
It consists in incorporating basic insight into all management plans and practices: For employees, commitments to the company will only be possible if they appear to be a clear means of achieving their dreams, ambitions and projects.
Currently, this concept of employee motivation is addressed only by studies of Motivational Functional Analysis.
These studies have shown that they evaluate their on the basis of a pre-determined doxy, which allows them, through the image that it reveals about the business, to evaluate what it offers them to realize their life goals.
By identifying and measuring these mobilization factors, managers can control, predict and anticipate on their “social performance” and put their human resource management “on the right path”.
This creates a nutritious ground for the development of solid and effective economic intelligence.
In his speech in Oslo, “Justice War,” Obama earned praise from the right.
The American right on Friday welcomed a speech that Barack Obama delivered a day earlier in Oslo, satisfied that the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize winner defended the concept of "just war" against the enemies of the United States.
Conservatives, who first mocked Obama’s award on October 9, this time applauded the presidential speech, including Sarah Palin, a former vice president candidate in the 2008 election.
I liked what he said, Palin, a muse of the right-wing Republican wing, told USA Today, adding that she herself expressed herself on the topic of the "sometimes necessary" war in her memoirs that are just coming out.
War is, of course, the last thing Americans would want to have to do, but it is necessary.
All terrorists should be detained there, he believes.
President Obama, who inherited two wars in Afghanistan and Iraq from his predecessor, George W. Bush, on Thursday in Oslo justified the deployment of forces and used the speech to clarify his decision to send an additional 30,000 troops to Afghanistan nine days before.
Another Obama opponent, Newt Gingrich, said the president had done “very good work” in Oslo.
I think the speech was really very good, congratulated the former Speaker of the House of Representatives, who especially appreciated the president's mention of "the existence of evil in the world".
In a way, I considered this speech quite historic," Gingrich said during an interview on the radio show "The Takeaway".
The former MP, whom some view as a potential Republican candidate in the 2012 presidential election, was thrilled to see the “leftist president” reminding the Nobel Committee members “that they themselves would not be free and could not pass the peace prize if the use of force did not exist.”
According to Michael Gerson, former speech author of George W. Bush, now editor of the Washington Post, Obama delivered a “very American speech.”
Not only did he present himself as a “world citizen” as always, but he “speaked like an American president” and reminded Europeans “that they live in a safe bubble that they have not created themselves, and that they are not doing too much to preserve it,” Gerson said.
Among the few dissatisfied from the right-wing ranks are the Bush era lamb, former U.N. ambassador John Bolton, who described the speech as “singular, bloody and uninspired,” as stated on the website National Review Online.
To the left of the president, for example, Democratic Representative Dennis Kucinich is frightened when he looks at Barack Obama justifying the use of force.
“When we wrap the war in the envelope of justice, we can easily justify the massacre of innocent people,” he warned.
However, the middle-left press holds a praiseful stance towards the president.
Although the Los Angeles Times still considers the awarding of the Peace Prize to Obama premature, it has rated his departure as a "super-performance" even for a speaker known for his talent.
The speech from Oslo should serve as a guide to international decisions in resolving conflicts, fighting poverty and oppression,” the newspaper said.
Obama "told the speech as needed," the New York Times said, describing the speech as "simple and informative."
Road carriers: three marathons to a deal that will save the supply of supplies for Christmas.
After three marathons of negotiations, the trade unions of road carriers and TLF, the only employer organization to stay until the end, reached an agreement on Friday night that ended the call to strike and the threat hanging over the supply of stocks for Christmas.
Transport Secretary Dominique Bussereau expressed his "pleasure" at the signing of the agreement on Friday after several negotiations that began on Wednesday morning.
After a second night of discussions, the negotiators broke up early Friday morning in the hope that the text of the agreement would be signed as soon as possible by the end of the morning.
Three employers’ organisations (FNTR, Unostra, OTRE) withdrew from the negotiations.
But it took another more than six hours of the meeting, which began at 11 a.m. to get all agreed and at 18 a.m. to sign the agreement.
This conflict “would hurt greatly” and “there would be a danger of disturbing the holidays at the end of the year,” Bussereau said.
The text includes an increase in wages by 4% for the lowest wages (for local and regional road transport) and by 2.9% for the highest wages (for international transport).
The hourly salary for the lowest wages is increased from 8.72 euros to 9,06.
It’s not much, but there’s a lot of effort behind it, explained Patrice Clos (FO).
Tonight we will give our members an order to avoid blockades, no blockades to supply centers.
But there may still be a few opponents who are not satisfied,” he added.
Philippe Grillot, president of the TLF, welcomed the “right deal,” although it was difficult to admit the high wage increases due to international competition.”
It will increase the monthly salary by 170 euros for the lowest salaries and by 100 to 120 euros for the highest.
It’s an agreement of common sense and respect for employees, CMaxime Dumont (CFDT) said, while Thierry Douine (CFTC) welcomed the “historic agreement.”
According to Richard Jaubert (CGT), this is an “acceptable compromise”.
The agreement also provides for a revaluation of travel expenditure of 3% and a report on the state of the road transport in the first half of 2010, which will also allow to focus on the issue of the 13th salary and the modernization of the collective agreement.
Bussereau recalled the “cutting of 100 million euros on corporate wage taxes” that was the subject of the government’s amendment to the draft budget bill for 2009, which was voted on Thursday night by the National Assembly.
The government will ask the Senate for a “consensus” vote.
The signature allows that this agreement will apply first to the enterprises that are members of this organization, later to the entire branch, in case of extension by the Ministry of Labour.
It will take place “as soon as possible,” Bussereau assured.
The whole process can only be stopped by the disagreement of employer organisations.
FNTR speaks of a “bad trade” as 100 million euros “have already been offered to the sector as part of compensation for part of the carbon tax.”
The Secretary of State for Transportation forced us to act in an emergency, not as a result of mutual analysis, but in order not to anger the turtle-eaters during the approaching Christmas holidays, Unostra complained.
For Otre, the agreement threatens to “buri a large number of small and medium-sized enterprises from the industry” in the next 12 months.
Suburban trains RER A: traffic interruption on the weekend, unions dissatisfied with the proposals of the transport company RATP.
The interruption on the RER A suburban train line, the largest public transport line in France, will continue during the weekend as Friday talks between trade unions and the RATP leadership on the second day of the strike did not lead to any concrete results in the question of the request for a premium.
On Saturdays and Sundays, the days of the important shopping weekend before Christmas, trains will only run between 10 a.m. and 20 a.m., on the main section (between La Défence and Nation) every second train will travel, outside this section only one train out of four.
Connections to SNCF will be disrupted in Nanterre Prefecture and passengers will be forced to switch to another train.
The Galeries Lafayette shops, which expect more than 200,000 customers every day, welcomed the fact that “RATP has sought to secure connections with large shops.”
The RER A line leads from the west to the east of the Paris agglomeration.
The section managed by RATP leads from Saint-Germain-en-Laye and Nanterre to Boissy-Saint-Léger and Marne-La-Vallée.
On Friday, one of the two trains was at peak and virtually no set went outside the peak as planned.
As on Thursday, the inhabitants of Ile de France arranged differently and there was no confusion on the platforms.
So early in the morning there were far fewer people than usual at Saint-Germain-en-Laye (Yvelines) station, among other things because of the lack of students and students.
Jack Nbakina, a 29-year-old engineer from Boissy-Saint-Léger (Val-de-Marne) explained that he got up “an hour and a half earlier to make sure he arrived on time.”
The station of Saint-Lazare was not overcrowded, the state railway SNCF said, forecasting a greater number of officers and security guards.
Suburban RER A trains operated by SNCF in the direction from or to Cergy-Le-Haut arrived or departed from Saint-Lazare Station with a subway connection.
Further general meetings of the strikers will be held on Saturday and Sunday to evaluate the results of the Friday afternoon meeting with the leadership, which the unions have rated as "weak".
RER management proposes negotiations on a special protocol for RER A suburban trains on all sides, adjustment of working hours, career course, etc.
However, this is not the case for drivers who are demanding a well-deserved premium, according to Thierry Garona.
The RATP even postponed proposals for the premium for the time being, embarrassing the CGT with the fact that the management “was unable to solve the problem while travel companies and the SNCF were able to do so.”
At the new meeting, which is scheduled for Monday, "the conditions for exercising the profession will be reviewed closer," the transport companies RATP specified.
That’s why trade unions think the company “make weekend travellers a joke.”
In the morning, about 150 drivers occupied the corporate committee at its Paris headquarters.
The leadership, which has so far refused any discussion during the strike, has therefore decided to meet in order to "reassure".
There is a danger that the conflict will spread to RER B on Tuesday, after Unsa and Independents announce a strike emergency.
The unions are demanding premiums ranging from 120 (Unsa) to 150 euros, of which 30 euros are variable (CGT, FO, CFDT, Sud (South), Indépendants (Independents)) and are struggling with the deteriorating working conditions on this line, which carries a million passengers daily.
RER suburban train drivers earn between €2,200 and €2,700 gross salary and between €600 and €650 in premiums for irregular working hours and for working on Sundays and holidays.
Turkish justice has dissolved the Kurdish side, and this decision has severe consequences.
The Turkish Constitutional Court on Friday ruled to cancel the country’s main pro-Kurdish party, which immediately sparked protests in the Kurdish community in the southeast and in Istanbul.
This decision could greatly complicate the task of the government, which is trying to give the Kurdish community a friendly hand and attempt to end 25 years of conflict.
The Party for Democratic Society (DTP) was dissolved because it became “the nest of activities threatening the state’s independence and indivisible unity,” Supreme Court Chairman Hasim Kilic told reporters after four days of negotiations.
The decision was adopted unanimously by 11 judges, when a majority of seven votes was needed to dissolve the party, Kiliç said, adding that 37 party cadres including its president Ahmet Türko and MP Aysela Tugluk have a five-year ban on participating in political life.
At the same time, the judge announced the withdrawal of parliamentary immunity by Mr. Türk and Mrs. Tugluk, and the confiscation of party assets by the Ministry of Finance.
The DTP has 21 seats in parliament (out of 500).
The leadership of the party warned before the verdict that the MPs would rather leave the Parliament than act in it as non-political members.
The decision is a continuation of the process initiated in 2007 by the Court of Cassation prosecutor Abdurrahman Yalcinkay, who accused the DTP of obeying the “orders” of the Kurdish Working Party (PKK), which Ankara and many countries consider a terrorist organization.
Many observers are convinced that the DTP is the legitimate political showcase of the PKK rebels.
The party assures that it has no “fundamental connections” with the PKK, but refuses to designate it as a terrorist organization and urges the government to negotiate with it.
The verdict comes as the government gives the Kurdish community a friendly hand and offers a series of measures to strengthen their rights and attempts to limit Kurdish support for the PKK to end the conflict.
The DTP leadership has confirmed that the dissolution of the party could lead to a resumption of tensions in southeast Anatolia, where many demonstrations over the past few weeks have overthrown against the conditions under which PKK leader Abdullah Öcalan is detained in clashes with police.
Since the announcement of the judgment, thousands of protesters have gathered in front of the DTP headquarters in Diyarbakir, a large city in the southeast that is predominantly populated by Kurds.
Police used tear grenades and water cannons, demonstrators threw Molotov cocktails or fired stones from bars.
Around a hundred people also demonstrated in Istanbul.
Following the verdict, Turk said the court’s decision would only “deep the despair.”
Turkey cannot resolve this issue by banning the party, he said in the press.
The government, made up of a party emerging from the Islamist movement, also condemned this decision.
We are in principle against interference.
This is not the case, Energy Minister Taner Yildiz said.
This decision is a complete shot at the democratic proposals initiated by the government, commented the political scientist Ahmet Insel.
Of course, we can expect a reaction from the PKK, he added.
On Thursday, the PKK claimed responsibility for one of the deadliest attacks in northern Turkey, which killed seven soldiers three days earlier.
Snow may come
This is what Wolfgang Brauburger wants.
Not because he would want to bully citizens, says the head of the winter technical services department FES.
But so that its employees can test and learn to control all vehicle technology.
This could happen for the first time this weekend, according to meteorologists.
More than 300 employees and 120 vehicles are ready to take care of the snow and ice.
The FES proceeds according to a precise plan.
Once there is snow all over Frankfurt and temperatures fall below zero, there will be 20 so-called A sections of large-shipers, explains Brauburger.
These sections include major and transit tracks such as Neue Weg and Hanauer Landstraße.
But also arrivals for firefighters, suburban public transportation lines, pedestrian zones and dropping sections like Atzelbergstraße.
FES service starts at three o’clock in the morning.
If necessary, it is necessary for a maximum of three hours to spray with moist salt, which holds better, something around 1040 kilometers.
Therefore, FES starts at three o’clock at night, “so that the roads are free when transportation to work starts.”
The snow starts to snow at 7:30 a.m.
Then we have a problem, says the head of the winter technical services department, “because no one is willing to make a place for the sinkers.”
Only when there is so much snow are the arrivals and connections on the line, including Rat-Beil-Straße.
The last priority is the side and side roads.
Brauburger knows they will complain there.
At five o’clock in the morning, the FES pedestrians will take their way, prioritizing the cleaning of dangerous places and crossings.
FES can’t usually take care of all cycling trails.
In Frankfurt there is a special service that tracks from 22 to 4.30 mostly bridges, says Brauburger.
As they quickly form a glacier, they move out immediately as soon as the temperature drops below two degrees.
Police will also call them if necessary.
The Dinosaur Column
The Tawa hallae looked like a lot of other meat-eating dinosaurs: A two-foot-long and 1.50-foot-high animal ran along two thick rear limbs, had an elongated skull with sharp, curved teeth, short front limbs with serpent-shaped nails and a long tail.
If this species lived a few million years later, there would be nothing extraordinary.
Sterling Nesbitt of the University of Texas in Austin and colleagues in the Thursday issue of Science magazine write that the Tawa hallae was one of the first dinosaurs to have these body traits.
The animal lived about 215 million years ago in present-day New Mexico, which was then located in the equatorial dry region of the supercontinent Pangea.
Tawa opens a new window to the earlier evolution of dinosaurs, says Nesbitt.
It tells us a lot about relatives, extension and signs of early dinosaurs.
In 2006, Nesbitt and other paleontologists began excavations at Ghost Ranch in northern New Mexico.
Sometimes we found a dozen dinosaur bones in one day, which is unprecedented for trias deposits, says team member Randall Irmis of the Museum of Natural History in Utah.
Some of the bones were quickly identified by scientists as a new species.
During the excavation, the remains of a total of five individuals were collected.
The discovery confirms theories about the early history of dinosaurs.
The name "Tawa" comes from the sun god of the Hopi Indians.
For Sterling Nesbit, this is an unusual finding: "Fossils of dinosaurs from trias are very rare, mostly only single fragments are found."
Other dinosaur experts do not share this enthusiasm without reservation.
This finding is not sensational, but it confirms some theories about the early history of dinosaurs, says Martin Sander of the University of Bonn.
According to the current scientific opinion, dinosaurs first appeared about 230 million years ago.
Many of the oldest fossils are not complete, so the assignment of pradinosaurs is mostly controversial.
Experts are discussing, for example, when the hunters were divided into three most important evolutionary lines: the meat-eating teropods, which later included the Tyranosaurus rex, Velociraptor and also birds, the long-haired four-legged sauropods and their relatives, and the herbivores Ornithischia (bird-eating), which included, for example, the species Triceratops and Stegosaurus.
Tawa hallae is the original therapist after the analysis of Nesbit and his colleagues.
It shows an interesting combination of primitive and advanced qualities, says Nesbitt.
On the Tawa hallae skull, for example, researchers found evidence of air bags that even teropod descendants of birds have.
Thanks to air bags, birds breathe more efficiently than mammals.
In the Tawa hallae, the bones of the spine were apparently partially filled with air.
Tawa is the oldest and most primitive teropod with airbags, says Randall Irmis.
Since the relative line of giant sauropods later also had air bags and light bones, this useful innovation was probably already created by a common ancestor of the two groups.
At least three waves of migration to North America
Because the most primitive dinosaurs known to date lived in South America, scientists concluded that sheepmen appeared there for the first time.
According to this, the three lines of development were soon divided and spread from South America to all the continents, which at the time, as the supercontinent Pangea, formed a unified earth mass.
In addition, the team found the remains of two other, not closely related teropods, along with the Tawa hallae.
The three may not come from a common, immigrant ancestor, scientists argue.
We believe there have been at least three waves of migration to North America, says Alan Turner of the American Museum of Natural History in New York, a co-author of the study.
Of course, there are also contradictions.
An even older species, Silesaurus, which belongs to the group of the heaviest dinosaurs, lived in today’s Poland, says Bonn paleontologist Martin Sander.
His assumption could put together a distorted picture, as many primitive dinosaur fossils have been preserved in South America, whereas they are rarely found on other continents.
How the dinosaurs proved that they evolved from a relatively rare reptile line to the ruling vertebrates on earth during the Earth’s Middle Ages remains a puzzle.
During the trias, dinosaurs shared their habitat with many other reptiles, such as the ancestors of today’s crocodiles and flying donkeys and countless other donkeys.
Around the end of the trias, dinosaurs spread throughout the world and many new species evolved, while relatives extinct and intersecting the trias and jury.
The success story did not last forever.
There are two hypotheses to explain this change, says Martin Sander.
There could have been a mass extinction that dinosaurs accidentally survived, but reptiles did not.
Or the dinosaurs adapted better, so they could push out the competition.
The success story did not last forever.
150 million years later, the impact of a meteorite helped another group of animals that also evolved into trias and has since lived in the shadow: mammals.
Solidarity from Vienna to Sao Paulo
The list is long and the signatories are international.
The list includes professors from the University of Toronto, the University of Cambridge, the University of Vienna or Berkeley, California.
Docents from Naples, Quebec, Edinburgh, New York, Sao Paulo, Berlin or Bremen have joined.
The police clearance of the occupied casino at Goethe University in Frankfurt has caused a worldwide uproar.
278 professors and teachers at Goethe University, as well as colleges across Germany, Europe, and North and South America, show solidarity with the protesting students at the Westend campus.
In a statement written in German and English, the presidiums “do not approve” of the police intervention.
Because the walls and works of art were damaged, University President Werner Müller-Estler had the building taken over by striking students and lecturers last week.
Five students were injured.
The damage to the matter, the signatories judge, does not justify "the violent dissolution of the self-organized teaching of students and teachers by the police command".
The clearance represents an “unacceptable interference” in the freedoms of research and science.
The exclusive focus on vandalism serves to “imlegitimate and criminalize protest” and distracts attention from content.
The chairman avoided the necessary discussion.
He called for an end to criminal prosecution.
It is said that most of the strikers did not support material damage.
Legitimate protest
Also the youth trade union Verdi and the German Trade Union solidarize with the students.
The protest is a legitimate expression of growing concern for one’s own future, says the mystery of the Earth Youth, Verdi Alexander Klein.
Hessen’s science minister Eva Kühne-Hörmann (CDU) is defending the progress of the university president and the police.
I am grateful to the university president.
Destruction and occupation are absolutely unacceptable means, she said on Thursday in Aktuellen Stunde (Current Time) in the Wiesbaden Land Assembly.
We have understanding for protest, but we have no understanding for vandalism, said CDU MP Peter Beuth.
The opposition factions of the SPD, the Greens and the Left see this differently.
The CDU takes the painted walls as a pretext to criminalize the protest, said Janine Wissler (Linke).
Instead of dealing with the arguments and demands of the students, there was a clearance.
Linke submitted a proposal calling on the Minister of the Interior to report on the police deployment.
New Silicon Valley
For many years it was considered a secret city, inaccessible to visitors from the West.
Zelenograd, one of the ten districts of the capital Moscow, in the Soviet Union it was a strictly guarded site where secret weapons research was carried out.
Today, this district with 216,000 inhabitants, located 37 kilometers from the center of Moscow, is considered the "Russian Silicon Valley".
There are important micro- and nanoelectronics research and production centers located here.
Already since September 2008, the delegates of Zelenograd have established contacts with the Frankfurt Scientific Center Riedberg - with university institutions and companies of the Frankfurt Innovation Centre (FIZ).
There were several mutual visits and on Wednesday in Frankfurt, Zelenograd and Ridberg signed a "Protocol on close cooperation".
The Russian delegation was headed by Moscow mayor Yuri Rosljak and the prefect of Zelenograd Anatoly Smirnov, for Frankfurt was signed by the chief planning referent Edwin Schwarz.
In 2010, representatives of FIZs and small and medium-sized enterprises engaged in natural science research will go to Zelenograd for a seminar.
Scientific Exchange
This is a scientific exchange.
It also concerns economic relations.
FIZ companies will be able to fit into the growing Russian market.
Instead, Russian research firms are seeking to obtain contracts in Germany.
Zelenograd is home to major Russian research institutes and companies.
These include the Moscow Institute of Electronic Technology, Sitronics and Rossijskaja Elektronika.
The district was founded in 1958 as the so-called "Socialist Planned City" for arms research.
Zelenograd (literally translated "Green City") got its name from the forested hilly landscape in which research facilities are planted.
Stuttgart brakes
Stuttgart 21 is not enough.
For the supporters of the project, it is simply the “new heart of Europe”.
S21 is more than just a railway station launch, more than a monstrous construction that will plunge the capital of Baden-Württemberg into a decade of desperate construction chaos.
Stuttgart 21 was created in the spirit of the 1980s.
The main railway stations, which ended in the city centre, were then considered to be the 19th-century transport-technical fossils, which acted as the brakes of modern railway transport, because it took enormously much time to propel locomotives from behind forward.
Take a moment, stop, go on – that’s how it should work.
And so the main railway stations disappear: in Frankfurt and Munich.
And in Stuttgart: the transit station, which lies roughly in the middle of the route of the trans-European railway between Paris and Budapest/Bratislava – hence the slogan of “the heart of Europe”.
It really starts with S21, although the visions of the 1980s are no longer compatible with reality.
The very ambitious designers themselves realized that in Hessen and Bavaria, the start of construction is almost unfinanced.
Since there are modern shuttle trains with motor and steering vehicles at both ends, main stations no longer have problems with getting in and out.
Still: It starts with Stuttgart 21 including the new ICE route to Ulm.
This was promoted by local and local politicians.
The rails work together, also because the risks of the largest individual infrastructure project in the republic are borne by the taxpayer and not the state group.
The project can still be excused in some way.
A new urban space will arise, which - if we believe the computer images of the designers - will contain a lot of green.
The S21 is harmful to the rail transport system.
Passage stations and the construction of the track are intended for passenger transportation, which - typically in the 1980s - was attributed to a tremendous increase.
There was no competition for cheap flights.
Modern transport policy must, however, primarily focus on strengthening freight transport, as rail transport is far more environmentally friendly than road freight transport.
But the new track is not suitable for freight trains due to sharp climbing.
Even more seriously, the S21 indirectly touches a lot of other railway projects.
Six billion euros were buried in Sweden.
This is the official number.
Experts estimate it to be between 10 and 15 billion.
It is clear that in the next decade there will be a lack of funding for other nodes and narrow spots in the network.
There are 60 major projects on the Ministry of Transport.
One of the most important is the construction of a roughly 180-kilometer route through the Rhine Valley.
Since 1987, this route has been built at a slow pace.
It would have to be pushed hard here.
But the S21 will be like a brake.
The route through the Rhine Valley becomes a bottle of international freight: right in the heart of Europe.
The government is investigating the airport
The government has left open in the Wiesbaden Land House whether it will oppose the decision of the Hessen Administrative Court (VGH) regarding the ban on night flights and let it be revised.
The CDU/FDP coalition has commissioned experts to legally assess the more than 400-page VGH ruling, Economy Minister Dieter Posch (FDP) said.
The VGH in Kassel today wrote in writing that the state would have to amend the night flight ban in the case of the planned northwestern ranway of Frankfurt airport.
The authorisation of 17 flights between 23:00 and 5:00 p.m., as the country’s government predicts, does not correspond to the law-enforced protection of the population from nightly air noise.
The coalition must decide by January 4 whether to request a revision of the judgment.
The opposition criticized the deferral and urged the representative of the government to renounce the revision of the Federal Administrative Court in Leipzig.
SPD chief Torsten Schäfer-Gümbel urged the CDU and FDP to return to the promises about the ban on night flights they made before the election.
It is damn hard if you can keep your word, said the leader of the Greens, Tarek Al-Wazir, in reference to the FDP electoral slogan “We keep the word.”
Minister Posch rejected Schäfer-Gümbel’s complaint that the country’s government is trying to get to its night flights through “the transgression of the law and tricks.”
Strict legal control takes its time.
The coalition does not want to work on the basis of a "fast first impression".
We need a realistic decision, said Stefan Müller (FDP).
His faction’s remarks on the ban on night flights have never been the same as those of the opposition.
US banks pay off aid
America’s big banks, shaken by the crisis, are getting rid of state bonds.
Bank of America on Wednesday paid off a $45 billion ($30 billion) bailout from the bank rescue fund Tarp.
According to CNBC, Citigroup is also planning to pay back state aid.
The constitutions thus want to get rid of the restrictions that occurred with the acceptance of money - limiting the payouts of bonuses to managers and paying high fees.
Bank of America has obtained $19 billion in net money from investors thanks to exchangeable bonds.
The rest of the money was taken from his cash, which was filled, among other things, thanks to trade union sales.
Bank Chief Kenneth Lewis expressed his gratitude to the U.S. taxpayer on Wednesday night: “The money injection helped us overcome a difficult time.
At the height of the financial crisis, the bank acquired investment bank Merrill Lynch.
Citigroup wants to free itself from its obligations to the state also by obtaining money on the capital market.
CNBC, citing sources, that the U.S. bank could have announced a capital increase of around $20 billion on Thursday.
A spokesman for Citigroup did not comment on this.
In June, Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan Chase and Morgan Stanley paid off the aid.
A quick choice
It went faster than expected.
The station introduced its successor just two weeks after the ZDF board pushed editor-in-chief Nikolaus Brender out of office.
Last night, the gremio wanted to agree on that person.
Peter Frey is the head of the ZDF studio in Berlin.
But the station did not confirm it - officially, so as not to precede the trial.
But the role could also be played by the fact that they did not want to harm ZDF intendent Markus Schächter if this proposal did not pass the board of directors.
Frey, Schächter’s candidate, needs the support of nine of the 14 members of the board.
The outcome of the vote was not known before the closing of this edition.
Two weeks ago, Schächter failed in the board of directors with his proposal to extend his contract with Nikolaus Brender for another five years.
Only seven members voted in favour of Brender, and seven voted against him.The loss of Brender's mandate was a bitter defeat for Schächter, though it was expected.
The EU’s majority in the board of directors had already signaled several weeks before the election that they did not want to confirm Brender in office.
The protest was organized by Hessen’s Prime Minister Roland Koch.
He refused to remain in the office of a highly respected editor-in-chief, arguing that Brender had reduced the quotas for watching the ZDF news broadcast.
Until shortly before the election there were therefore protests in which the political influence on the ZDF was sharply criticized.
Thirty-five state lawyers have also been involved in the debate, saying Koch’s action is unconstitutional.
It was useless.
About person
Peter Frey was born on August 4, 1957 in Bingen.
He studied Politics, Pedagogy and Romanesque.
He then worked for Südwestfunk and Frankfurter Rundschau.
In 1983, Frey moved to ZDF, first to the "heute-journal".
Other stations: 1988 to 1990 personal referent editor-in-chief; 1991/92 correspondent in Washington; up to 1998 head and moderator of "Morgenmagazins"; up to 2001 head of foreign policy ZDF; since then head of main studio ZDF.
After Brender, who was elected journalist of the year by Medium Magazine on Wednesday, was removed, the Greens announced that they would file a constitutional lawsuit.
Koch’s opponent in the board of directors, Rhine-Falcon prime minister Kurt Beck, explained last week that the states should change their state contract with the ZDF so that the intendant’s personnel proposals cannot be blocked by a politically motivated majority.
Beck also rejected the exclusion of party politicians from the supervisory boards of the ZDF.
Brender’s supposed successor, Peter Frey, commanded the board a clever chess move – immediately after Brender was removed he strongly criticized the board.
Thanks to this proof of journalistic independence, he could be nominated as editor-in-chief without losing his face, both by Schächter and by the board of directors, without suspecting that the party would be pushed into office.
In party arithmetic, Frey is among the left-wing liberals.
Study is getting rid of harampads
Partial success for students: After a year of strike, ministers of culture finally went to the federal states on Thursday: At the conference of ministers of culture and university rectors, both sides agreed that there is a will to improve the study conditions for bachelor and master.
Students should be able to master their studies in the future.
In particular, they agreed to reduce the test burden: Basically, each study module should be completed with a single test.
In addition, the workload of students should be reviewed, and a “real and defendable rate” should be guaranteed.
Politicians and universities want to simplify the recognition of exams between universities in Germany and abroad.
The Länder undertake to create a more flexible joint structural assignment for undergraduate and master’s degrees.
Land deviations should cease to exist.
Less Tests
Since the beginning of the student protests in the worm, ministers of culture and university rectors have had winged words in their mouths for better study.
Now, for the first time, they are filled with specific content.
The so-called Accreditation Board has decided that the number of exams will be partially drastically reduced: "Each module will, as a rule, be completed with only one exam," says the 30-page report, which aims to partially re-regulate the approval of the fields of study.
"A significantly lower test burden," said Reinhold Grimm, chairman of the accreditation board, was to "stop the misdevelopment that significantly limited the difficulty of study."
To this end, the “difficulty of the study” is to be the “decisive criterion” in the implementation in the future.
Modules and content must be "hardly checked" to "not unnecessarily restrict students in their choice"
The seminars.”
Students should have a “claim for a space that enables and encourages their own initiative.”
The rules are to apply when approving new fields of study, after review, but also for existing fields of study.
They need to be “re-accredited” every five years – which means it will take until 2015 for all fields of study to be re-checkled.
Ten accreditation agencies across Germany are responsible for this, which are subject to accreditation boards established by the federal counties.
In October, the ministers of culture called on the federal counties to act on the agencies so that the load of teaching materials is not too large and the test regime is not strict.
In the various federal states, universities and universities have already agreed with the federal ministries on appropriate measures.
As the only country so far, the Rhine-Falcon has promised additional funds for the further development of the Bologna Process.
The funds should primarily be used by universities to pay for consultancy programs and student counseling, and to strengthen examination and foreign authorities.
The state and universities are planning to spend 10 million euros on this.
At the beginning of 2010, the government intends to submit a new Higher Education Act to Parliament.
Only one exam is required for completion of the study module.
The forming of studies should be even more flexible, guaranteeing the recognition of exams from other universities and facilitating the availability of a master’s degree.
By the end of next year, the level of compliance of all studies in the country should be reviewed.
On Thursday, the government and the opposition met again over the study conditions in the country.
Besides criticism, there were also criticisms of the resolution.
The Federal Board of Higher Education Groups of Juso called for the formation of education policy not to take place in the future "behind closed doors" of ministers and university rectors.
At the latest after the strike, “at least a word” should be spoken to the students as the persons concerned.
Future academics also received support from the University Rectors’ Conference (HRK) President Margrethe Wintermantel: “We need student experience,” she said on Thursday at a meeting with ministers of culture with whom the HRK consulted on a joint reform report.
According to the Department of Education and Science (GEW), the Bonn resolutions did not go far enough: They demand a legal claim that would allow every graduate with a bachelor’s degree to access a continuing master’s degree.
Second, the counties must ensure that there are enough places available tomorrow for today’s generation of undergraduate students in master’s fields with the best possible study conditions, said GEW board member Andreas Keller.
Federal states need to employ far more lecturers.
However, the Ministry of Culture did not comment on the free access to master’s programs.
More than a note to Herta Müller
Getting to Germany and out is nice, almost no control..." sounds the introductory line of one poem by poet Werner Söllner, who in this tearful language piece themes the experience of arriving one dissident who gained freedom but lost his language environment.
Werner Söllner, born in 1951 in Banat, Romania, worked first as a teacher of German and English in Bucharest and later as a lecturer at a children’s book publishing house, then moved to Frankfurt am Main in 1982.
Söllner was awarded various literary awards, in 1993 he taught poetry at the legendary Goethe University in Frankfurt, and since 2002 he has been the head of the Hessen Forum of Literature at the Mousonturm in Frankfurt.
A significant non-liberal uprising was caused on Tuesday at a seminar in Munich, which was about "German literature in Romania in the mirror and broken mirror of its security acts".
The apparently insecure and infected Söllner left a statement in which he confessed to his fellow Romanian German writers, including Richard Wagner, William Totok, Franz Hodjak and Helmuth Frauendorfer, that he had collaborated as a secret informant to the Romanian secret service Securitate.
Together with some of the present, Söllner won the German Language Award in 1989.
The attempts to recruit were said to have begun unobtrusively, first in 1971.
I am, Söllner continued, "that is, someone who has not resisted enough to attempts to intimidate by Securitate."
Werner Söllner is the secret agent Walter.
Almost simultaneously with the award of the Nobel Prize to Herta Müller and her unprecedented literary dealing with the mechanisms of dictatorial government, the literary scene, and especially the community of German authors from Romania, is shaken by a case that marks the depths and shame of a political system based on control and espionage.
Werner Söllner is not, at least if it can be said from the current state of knowledge, just a perpetrator, but also a victim.
In the Securitate acts, secret agent Walter played some role, said after Söllner's confession Michael Markel, referring to the positive influence on himself by secret agent Walter.
“He’d cut me off at that time on all the points that were important to him,” says Markel.
He has a moral duty to make this note.
Söllner’s statement was in this form and in front of this audience an unexpected, but absolutely surprising confession of the former dissident and his collaboration with the Romanian intelligence service is not.
Herta Müller wrote in July, reading her own 914 pages, that Germany was a pleasant reserve for the Spicly Securitate.
The concerned, it can be assumed, will speculate and, in some cases, probably know which name is hidden behind the cover name Sorin, Voicu and just Walter.
Unlike in the domestic, meanwhile already very certain inspection of the components of Stazi, the manipulation of the remains of the Securitate control is still very diffuse.
In recent years, systemic awareness has been curtailed and restricted.
One of Birthler's offices, which corresponds to the National Council for the Processing of Securitate Files (CNSAS), was established only in 1999, issuing the act has been ongoing since.
Only since 2005 has there been a law governing the management of components.
That former Securitate members still have a great influence in Romania, after the publication of the Nobel Prize for Herta Müller, one interview in which one of the former heads of Securitate from Temeshwar expressed a rejection of the recipient of the award.
He has a psychosis and has only been interviewed once.
The humiliation of power was expressed here in the form of freedom of expression.
Of course, there are inevitable questions connected with the Söllner case, as in the case of the silent guilt.
The special reaction of the audience to Söllner’s confession suggests that the continuation of this chapter will be determined by the desire for knowledge rather than by the accusation of guilt and shame.
To the genesis of the work of Herty Müller, who received the Nobel Prize yesterday, this is more than a note below.
Champions League Deposit
It looked like a clean-dressed sales representative came from a cute Christmas party where a sports goods manufacturer distributed sweets, as a quarter of an hour after midnight the new VfBr coach Christian Gross, accompanied by an orange-colored bag of the sponsor, entered the recalled Mercedes C-Class.”
A man with a markant baldness was forced to drive him to a foreign city.
Otherwise he could drive himself - alcohol was not in the game, and drunk by luck was the 55-year-old man also a little.
It was a nice evening, but tomorrow we will continue to work.
Or it is just beginning.
With the words of only three days of a committed Swiss: “We have reached the eight-finals,” namely in the Champions League thanks to a 3:1 win over Unirea Urziceni from Romania, “but we must not let ourselves glimpse by the success: it will be a brutally tough fight against the descent.”
A far more important task is ahead of us on Sunday.
It is important to repeat the performance of the royal class in Mohuči even on an ordinary league day.
And to avoid re-evident weaknesses after three quick goals Marica (5.), Träsche (8.) and Pogrebnyaka (11).
Losing
The Champions League eight-finals (matches 16/17 + 23/24 February / retaliatory matches 9/10 + 16/17 March) will be drawn on 18 December in Nyon.
The joy of Babbel’s successor will be preserved.
Not only the supposed healer, who gave insecure Stuttgart professionals within a short period of time self-confidence, willingness to engage and joy of the game.
I went to the players and told them to focus on their strengths and I encouraged them to be more courageous, explained soul healer Gross so simply sounding a successful recipe, which but under the action of therapist Babbel did not prove but no longer any effectiveness.
Babbel supporter Jens Lehmann said, “When a new momentum comes in football, sometimes things happen that you don’t think are possible.”
And Sami Khedira, who after a multi-week break caused by injury, became the best player on the pitch thanks to his dynamics, tried to describe the "phenomenon" with the proverbial "fresh wind" and the working procedures of the new supervisor: "He is a man who is radical and demands discipline.
That’s what we need in the current situation.”
This was obviously missing from Babbel.
VfB Stuttgart is not saved yet, warns sports chairman Horst Heldt
But VfB Stuttgart needs more stability.
Like Gross, neither players nor managers want to overestimate a victory against the weakened replacement and completely overloaded defense of the Romanian guest.
They would win in Glasgow before the ugly awakening came after a 0:4 defeat in Leverkusen, Khedira thinks.
Sporting chairman Horst Heldt recalled that while one goal was achieved in the season, the other is still a long way away.
We are not behind the water yet.
That Heldt did not celebrate his 40th birthday even after his first domestic victory in three months was due to the weekend events that were newly brought to life in the form of a television interview with goalkeeper Jens Lehmann just before the start of the match.
There are decisions that are made by others and not by Jens, Heldt replied to Lehmann’s harsh criticism.
He predicted a weak leadership and decided to change the coach after the pressure of puberty fans.
Even the cancellation of his day off after the matches, Lehmann described as a sign of lack of sovereignty and envy.
Lehmann’s statements “formulate pure egoism,” Heldt replied and announced the consequences for the goalkeeper.
The four-year-olds are no longer happy with their lives.
In any case, they agree with the others that without the work of the removed coach team, such a strong and fighting performance would not have been possible.
Babbel and his assistants had a “large share of success,” Heldt and Lehmann say unanimously – and the man with the igelit bag agrees.
World Championships in Heavyweight
A passionate duel in Bern: Challenger Kevin Johnson constantly provoked with words and gestures world champion Vitalia Klička.
However, after twelve tough rounds, the Ukrainian defended his title in the heavyweight boxing organization WBC.
The decision of the judges was unanimous.
Vitaly Kličko remains the world champion in heavyweight boxing.
The 38-year-old WBC champion defeated American Kevin Johnson on Saturday night (120:108, 120:108, 119:109).
This is his third successful defense of the title since his return in October 2008.
Previously, the Ukrainian was twice World Champion of organizations WBO and WBC.
Unfortunately, this did not happen as everyone expected.
Kličko improved his balance to 39 victories in 41 professional duels, twice defeated due to injuries.
The challenger Johnson was defeated for the first time in the 24th match.
In front of approximately 17,000 spectators in the Bern Arena, the 2,02 meters high Kličko fought mainly with his left hand.
The eleven centimeters smaller Johnson, who announced the end of Kličkov’s era before the duel, was relegated from the world champion’s strikes, so Kličko could not strike the decisive strike with his dangerous right hand.
All in all, the passive Johnson did very little on the caller and tried only to get into the next rounds.
He provoked with words and gestures, but his strikes rarely hit the world champion.
But he is only the second boxer after Timo Hoffmann in 2000, who fought full twelve rounds with Kličko.
The contest was held in the Swiss capital.
He described Klička as “a disgusting zombie” who “does not know anything properly.”
During Friday's weighing, the champion let himself be provoked by pulling Johnson's sunglasses out of his nose "so he could see his eyes."
Fourth victory after Kličkov's return
Kličko remained unbeaten after his fourth match after his return on 11 October 2008.
After a break of almost four years, he defeated Nigerian Samuel Peter in Berlin and took back his WBC belt, which he had to surrender before without a fight.
This year he defeated Juan Carlos Gómez of Cuba and Chris Arreol of the United States in September.
In this match I got only one shot and I am physically in good shape, Kličko justified a quick return to the ring.
But his dream remains to defend all four important titles in the family.
Brother Vladimir is the world champion of WBO and IBF.
The WBA belt was worn by Britain's David Haye after he removed the 2.13-meter-high Nikolai Vulaev in November.
Haye cancelled the summer match against Kličko, which was scheduled for September.
He isly planning a match against Kličkov at Wembley Stadium in London.
Kunduz case
The leader of the Greens, Jürgen Trittin, called the defense minister Guttenberg a liar because of the misinformation about the Kunduz affair.
The SPD and Linke (Left) are calling on the Chancellor to give explanations.
Hamburg/Berlin - According to the latest findings on the Kunduz airstrike, the opposition believes Defense Minister Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg (CSU) has committed a deliberate deception.
The minister to the deadly bombing of two tanks in September said "consciously a lie," said the head of the Green faction Jürgen Trittin in the Saturday news program ARD "Tagesschau".
Let’s call it the usual expression: lying.
The death order was issued in violation of the rules of the International Security Support Forces in Afghanistan (ISAF).
This is the essence of the NATO report that Mr. Guttenberg read, Trittin said.
On Friday, it was revealed that the attack was not just the destruction of hijacked trucks, but the targeted killing of two Taliban leaders.
During the U.S. airstrike, which was requested by the German Commander of Kunduz, Colonel Klein, according to NATO investigations, up to 142 people were killed or wounded.
The Greens, SPD and Linke called on German Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) on Saturday to speak immediately before the Bundestag and also clarify what Guttenberg really knew about the incident.
Ms. Merkel must explain whether the targeted killing strategy is part of the Afghan policy of the Bundestag — and whether the Chancellor’s Office, the Bundeswehr and the intelligence service have approved this new strategy, challenged Jürgen Trittin and fellow Greens Renate Künast.
Government spokesman Ulrich Wilhelm rejected the criticism.
The chancellor's office has no influence on the concrete deployment of the Bundeswehr in Afghanistan, he said.
On Saturday, there were also loud doubts about the ministry’s hearing on the background of the release of Inspector General Wolfgang Schneiderhan and Secretary of State Peter Wichert.
According to SPIEGEL, they both informed Guttenberg correctly and completely about the background of the attack on the tanks.
Officially, it was said that they had to deny the existence of NATO reports and conceal sensitive details from the minister.
The two senior officials said they had been alerting the Defense Ministry to several reports, including a two-page document by Colonel Klein and a report by the military police.
The "Frankfurter Allgemeiner Sonntagszeitung" reports that Wichert had, in the meantime, asked in a letter to clarify the situation.
It is noted that he has not yet received any response.
The Ministry did not comment on the complaints on Saturday and pointed out that this will be dealt with in the investigation committee of the Federal Assembly, which will be established next Wednesday.
World of Dreams
Some people see images and hear voices that others do not see or hear.
Not only are mentally ill or intoxicated people breaking the boundaries between imagination and reality.
As long as this happens in sleep, everything is fine.
If we lie with our eyes closed in our dark room, we are allowed to surround ourselves with the wildest imaginations and fantasy delusions.
Those who are awake in dreams, who see and hear things that others do not see or hear, in today’s Western world are mostly considered fools or drug addicts, or at least strangers.
However, such images and voices do not only occur in mentally ill people or in drug addiction.
The same neuronal processes that allow us to design houses, paint pictures, or write novels make the boundaries between dream, imagination, and reality fuse.
Dreams altered state of consciousness can occur in a variety of forms, in the best case we call them visions, in the worst illusions.
Although the initiator and effect may vary, the vision of the mystic Hildegard von Bingen, the drug experiences of the New-Age prophet Carlos Castaneda, the shamanic states of illusion, psychosis and hallucinations can be derived from similar processes.
Hallucinations or sights occur when the balance of the brain’s neuronal transmitters – primarily dopamine, norepinephrine, serotonin and acetylcholine – is disrupted and the interaction between different parts of the brain is disrupted.
Complex hallucinations and delusional thoughts occur very often in schizophrenic psychosis.
Gravity has no power over it.
The connection between illusion and dream has been employed by philosophers and doctors since ancient times.
Aristotle understood hallucinations as a form of sleep in a wakeful state, Wilhelm Griesinger, one of the founders of modern psychology, noted in 1861 "the great resemblance of hallucination to dream states", for Sigmund Freud the dream was even "psychosis, with all nonsense, delusions, deception of senses".
It’s autumn 2001, Henning T. turns into a comic book character.
His body is two-dimensional and colorful.
Gravity has no power over it, it floats on the ceiling of the room.
He feels stumbling.
Behind him winged devil characters with bloody red grimasas, cherishing teeth.
They chase him, dig into him with heavy, fiery shoes, throw him around the wall, feel the pain on the whole body.
Loud, bad voices threaten from the walls and from the radio.
He can no longer tolerate the voices that insult him.
Henning T. pulls out two cables from the stereo, wraps them into a loop and fixes it to the hook on the ceiling.
He sits on one speaker and puts a loop around his neck.
is jumping.
The shell permits.
Teach yourself, the choir’s voices shout out the drums, “Go to the clinic and let yourself be treated!”
Today, Henningu T. is 40 years old, has experienced six acute psychoses, the last two years ago, the first almost 20 years ago.
LSD was introduced.
His diagnosis is schizoaffective paranoid psychosis, in addition, he is mania-depressant, takes medications against depression, mania, schizophrenia.
He learned to live with his illness, he has been married for three years.
In psychosis, I experienced the worst fear and the deepest doubts, he says.
Ghosts are a terrible reality.
Approximately one percent of people suffer from schizophrenia at least once in their lives, and it is the second most commonly treated disease in psychiatric clinics after depression.
In acute schizophrenic psychosis, people with disabilities can no longer distinguish between the internal and external worlds, they get into an overstated state that can lead to hallucinations, size, relationship illusions or the illusion of persecution.
Particularly widespread is the hearing of voices – voices that command, comment, or lead dialogue.
Optical hallucinations are not unusual.
The affected person is unable to distinguish the important from the unimportant, the brain cannot filter out disturbing signals, consciousness is flooded with impressions.
Like dreams, the psychosis of the stable opens up a flood of thoughts and fantasies that come from the deepest layers of consciousness.
The perception of reality in psychosis is subject-centric, says Professor Thomas Fuchs, Chief Medical Officer of the Clinic of General Psychiatry at the University Clinic in Heidelberg.
The schizophrenic is at the center of the events, everything has meaning directed to him.
At the same time, he gets into a passive role, becoming, like in a dream, overwhelmed by events and unable to actively form them.
Thus, schizophrenians often feel threatened, controlled and manipulated.
Comparison with reality is mostly not possible, ghosts are a terrible reality, awakening is excluded.
Having a hallucination once in a lifetime
Other than in dreams, Fuchss says, “the sensory and spatial structure of reality perceived in psychosis remains fundamentally preserved.”
Illusory thoughts and hallucinations are based on reality, and the alienation of experience occurs within the real framework.
Scientists are still wondering why our brains are doing such things.
Exceptional states can lead to a short-term loss of touch with reality in any person, Fuchs says.
Not everyone develops into psychosis.
There seems to be a genetic predisposition to schizophrenia, but studies on twins have shown that genes are not the only determining factor.
Scientists believe that those affected have minimal brain damage.
We believe that in the early stages of development, neuronal maturation of the brain will be damaged, for example, by a mother’s viral disease during pregnancy, Fuchs explains.
But it remains a puzzle about how a breakdown of the neuronal system will occur, which has not manifested itself for many years.
Environmental influences also play a role - stress or traumatic experiences can be the initiator of psychosis, if there is a disposition to it.
Also, hallucinogenic drugs can trigger psychosis, as they interfere with the transmission system.
When our brain becomes
The crazy thing is that psychotronics suffer from their hallucinations, and to get rid of them, they swallow expensive medications, others give money for drugs to get them, says psychology professor Erich Kasten of Lübeck.
Whether we perceive delusions as pleasant or unpleasant is often just a matter of attitude.
Kasten has been collecting reports of hallucinations and delusions for ten years, and last year he interpreted his findings in the book "Die irreale Welt in unserem Kopf" (The Unreal World in Our Heads).
Hallucinations are a typical accompanying phenomenon of psychosis, but also a surprising number of other diseases.
In addition to psychological disorders such as border personality or depression, they also often cause diseases such as migraine, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis or Alzheimer’s disease or brain trauma.
Surprisingly, the brain of a healthy person itself hallucines under certain conditions.
Hallucinations, according to Kasten, consist of the contents of thoughts that are normally suppressed.
They arise when the parts of the brain in which sensory perception is processed are too active or poorly suppressed; if our brain is overwhelmed, or when stimulation is lacking.
Drugs can trigger this condition as well as brain damage or psychosis.
But also withdrawal of stimuli, stress, worries about love or other exceptional conditions.
In recent studies, up to one-third of respondents said they had experienced hallucinations at least once in their lives.
In the summer of 2005, Sarah K. is 16 years old, she lives in a small town in Meklenburg-Predni Pomořansk and attends a high school there.
Actually a normal girl.
If there weren’t those pictures and the voices.
During the breaks, it can happen that she will appeal to a columnist with long, dark hair.
When she answers, her classmates look at her with surprise - nobody but her sees and hears this boy.
This daring girl is considered to be a tight dreamer, but Sarah K. doesn’t dream, she knows it.
He is awake, he hears and sees the boy, just as he hears and sees the girl sitting next to him in the bench.
He can even feel his presence, at least for a few moments.
It’s a nice feeling, he likes this guy.
Are you crazy? he asks sometimes.
But he knows that this boy and other delusions are not real and will disappear again.
At night, the sights are more scary.
They are often a burden.
When she sits in the classroom, she can’t watch the lesson many times, because the teacher in her eyes and ears is presenting a new fellow student, but he explains it to all others heavily and visibly on the table of the mathematical equation.
At night, the phenomena are rather devastating.
When she waits in her dark room for a sleep that rarely comes and too late, she can often not distinguish whether she is awake or if she is already asleep, whether the images she sees, grimases, or a girl with bleeding cut wounds on her arms and legs arise before her open or closed eyes.
Leave me alone, screaming at those characters.
She didn’t tell her parents or friends about it, they thought she was mad.
Sarah K. is 20 years old today.
She graduated from college last year and lives with her boyfriend.
A year ago, the hallucinations stopped.
Since she contacted psychologist Kastena on the Internet, she knows exactly that she hasn’t gone crazy.
Prejudice is also the art of despair
If someone is socially isolated or is deprived of stimuli, they are more likely to have hallucinations, says Kasten.
I think the brain then doesn’t have enough occupation and takes care of its own entertainment.
Sarah K., a single child, was afraid of other children as a little girl, often playing alone.
Her hallucinations began when at the age of 13 she learned that the man her father has called since she thought it was not her own father.
Because visual and acoustic hallucinations involve the same brain regions that also process real sensations and sounds, it is difficult for people like Sarah K. to distinguish between delusions and reality.
Hallucinations are also images created by the brain, which is why they are so realistic.”
Also, night dreams are evaluated by Kasten as a form of hallucination.
Hallucinations of healthy people are not fundamentally different from hallucinations in acute psychosis.
Compared to schizophrenics, mentally healthy people are able to identify their delusions as unrealistic.
Kasten therefore advises his patients to evaluate hallucinations as extraordinary abilities.
The border between dream and hallucination
Unfortunately, in our world that is too concentrated on consciousness, imaginary experiences are mostly pathologized, says Michael Schmidt-Degenhard, a professor at Heidelberg and head of the Psychiatric and Psychotherapeutic Clinic at the Florence-Nightingale Hospital in Düsseldorf.
Psychosis is a severe, painful disease, but it also brings positivity, creativity - delusion is also the art of despair.
Schmidt-Degenhard examined the so-called oneiroid form of experience, a particular form of altered consciousness to dream.
Oneiroid states are highly complex, detailed fictional dreams that the person concerned considers real and can not even distinguish them backwards from the alert state.
Oneiroid state of consciousness occurs in extreme situations caused by trauma or illness, such as patients with polyradicular inflammation who experience motor paralysis at full consciousness.
When a person is in danger of losing the world and himself, a persistent, complete inability to move, he replaces life-threatening real situations with his own, imaginary world, which is disconnected from reality, says Schmidt-Degenhard.
The border between dream and hallucination.
Because in reality it is not possible to manage a situation, the worlds will change, but the real situation will be present in the imagination.
An intense form of supporting the senses and transferring the senses into some unbearable situation, which allows us to form our own capacity, to pass through the moment into loss of consciousness.
Everything is real, even later in memories
Also, art historian Peter Cornelius Claussen describes his oneiroid experiences in his book "Herzwechsel" (the exchange of the heart) as a rescue action of the soul.
He was 49 years old when, after a heart valve surgery followed by a heart transplant, his consciousness went on a several-day journey, with his body lying immobile on the intensive care unit.
Claussen plunged into the world he created, visited foreign times and places: He becomes an old man attached to a bed, in a train sanatorium, a robot watches his health.
He lived in the early Middle Ages among the nobility that produced narcotic substances from blood.
On a motorcycle, he is kidnapped by a Greek to his homeland, on a hospital bed he surfaces on a firm in the Alps and meets a Korean mafia.
They immerse themselves entirely in imaginary events, everything is real, even later in memories.
These inner paths are fundamentally different for Claussen from any dream.
A dream is a different state, it describes your experience.
In contrast to dreams, the memories of those mental journeys are still clear after years and in insignificant details.
Even brighter and more intense than the real experience.
The intensity of this experience breaks the horizon of our other true experiences, says psychiatrist Schmidt-Degenhard.
After all, oneiroid states, psychoses, hallucinations, and drug intoxication show how fragile our inner images of external reality are even in an awake state.
Any change in the state of consciousness, psychologist Kasten summarizes, “can lead to the distortion of what we call reality.”
This can also be enriching.
Snow may come
Burda
The 27th edition of the children's
The new head of publishing Kallen is a transitional solution: In the long run, Hubert Burda wants to hand over his business to his two children, he told SPIEGEL.
The holding will remain 100% owned by the family.
Hamburg - Publisher Hubert Burda has long seen his business in the hands of his children.
Both children will inherit at age 27 and have a firm will to enter the enterprise, the 69-year-old man told SPIEGEL.
We have dealt with the details carefully.
The question of whether they are also active in the company is posed only afterwards.
The question is whether they have the ability to do so.
It is impossible to put your children at the head of 7500 employees unless they are sufficiently capable.
It would kill both children and the business.
Burda announced on Thursday that he would withdraw from the board of directors from January, and appointed his successor, Paul-Bernhard Kallen.
Kallen, 52, has been a board member at Burda since 1999.
He was first in charge of technology.
Later, the responsibility for the company’s assets was added to the Department of Finance and, after Jürgen Todenhöfer’s resignation, to the Department of Direct Marketing, Foreign Affairs, Press and Finance.
For the first time, no member of the family is in charge of the publishing house.
Burd’s children are 19 and 17 years old, his son Felix, who would be 42 years old today, died a few years ago.
Kallen’s appointment also serves to “translate 10, 15 years,” Burda said.
The holding should also be 100% owned by the family in the future, says Burda.
Regarding the cases of Schickedanz and Schaeffler, Burda expressed that even family are not sure of disappearance: “It has always touched companies that let themselves be infected by the craving for capital, that they speculated and thought they could become big players.
That was never my strategy.
He never had “dreams of world power,” Burda says.
I don’t see myself as a political preceptor of this country, like Springer, and I don’t want to play the world league with “Time,” these deals are too big.
Comprehensive Care for Beauty
Everything you want in the field of beauty and well-being is at your disposal.
This is determined by El Corte Inglés, which has just launched the operations of the Callao (Madrid) business center with an area of more than 1000 m2, in which a variety of body care services are provided.
The wellness department is located on the eighth floor, where such prestigious companies as Hedonai engaged in laser depilation are located; Spaxión, areas for relaxation and aesthetic procedures; Luis & Tachi peluqueros; Marina d'Or with a gym or L'Occitane offering natural cosmetics, and others.
There is also a nutrition department and mainly a tea shop offering more than 130 different types of tea.
You can also enjoy relaxing massages with your partner while enjoying the view of the capital, you can rent a relaxation zone for two hours and arrange your own 'beauty party' in the company of up to eight friends, relax in the spa, give yourself a massage and a glass of champagne, which are some of the variants of Spaxion.
This is a total of about 250 m2 in the form of 12 salons, in which the above services are provided, as well as the most modern facial, body and hydrotherapy procedures.
As an example we can give cavitation, which is used in the fight against cellulite, or vibration platforms.
The facility is also equipped with these machines, in addition to virtual trainers, who monitor the individual actions of clients and provide completely individual care.
It all starts by inserting a personal key into the contact display, which is located opposite the machine.
Then you can watch video shows that show you the correct execution of our training set.
Your instructor guarantees that 15 minutes (including heating and stretching) is enough to exercise all your muscles.
And if after the exercise we have the desire to go to the hairdresser, the company Luis & Tachi has a space where individual procedures are carried out to heal the hair, improve their shine and nutrition.
Innovation and exceptionality are the motives of this city wellness center, which is open every day from 10.00 to 22.00.
Escotes Variados
Christmas is approaching and this is the time when it is advisable to find out what celebrities are wearing, and to adjust to that even your solemn wardrobe.
The shape of the cut is very important to highlight the figure, which is necessary to keep in mind.
We make a few proposals.
Singer Fergie chose an extravagant and very complicated cut.
Endesa and Barcelona, with electric cars
Together with the city council of Barcelona, the energy company Endesa has founded the 'Office LIVE'.
This is a project for the development and promotion of electric vehicles in the capital of Catalonia.
The LIVE’ Office (Logistics for the Deployment of Electric Vehicles) will establish and manage the roadmap for the deployment of electric vehicles in the city and will provide mobility agreements, handle, coordinate and submit contributions, etc.
It will also develop the MOVELE project, promote electric vehicles, gather views and results of activities in the sectors involved.
Overall, the aim is to support this means of transport of the future.
3 Electrical cities
However, Barcelona is not the only city to participate in the project to introduce electric vehicles in Spain.
Madrid and Sevilla will also join the project.
These are the three cities that the government has chosen as part of the MOVELE Plan to support the introduction of electric vehicles.
Endesa has already signed a framework agreement with the Catalan government.
The aim is to support research and technological development activities in the Catalan Autonomous Region.
This includes energy-related activities and, above all, energy efficiency.
This is not the only initiative with Endesa’s participation in the promotion of electric vehicles.
The company is represented in European standardization teams and is actively implementing a number of additional projects such as G4V, ELVIRE or CENIT VERDE.
Zapatero is forecasting a 'rest period' for the automotive industry.
Prime Minister José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero predicts that the Spanish automotive industry, the country’s main export sector, is awaiting a “period of calm.”
In the economic report of the Prime Minister for 2009, Zapatero summarized the measures that were introduced during the year to support the automotive sector.
"Without the Competitive Plan for the automotive industry, we would be in a state of abandonment today, the closure of some of our main manufacturing plants," the prime minister said.
“Thanks to this plan and the desire of individual brands to continue to operate in Spain in this highly competitive sector, a certain period of calm is expected in the future for this industry, which is our main export sector,” he added.
In this sense, he noted that the competitive plan, which forms part of the Integral Plan for the Automotive Industry (PIA), has allocated 800 million euros to projects of 19 manufacturers and 137 subsidiary companies, which have mobilized an investment of more than 3 billion Euros.
The Prime Minister explained that this investment is intended for the development of new models, for the modernization of production and existing processes.
Zapatero also highlighted government measures to support the demand and mentioned the 2000E plan, which is implemented in collaboration with autonomous regions and automotive brands.
According to the president, this plan allowed to reduce by 6% the average level of emissions for new vehicles sold on the Spanish market, and ensured a "significant increase" in registrations, specifically in November by "40 percent".
20,000 square meters of classic vehicles
The first International Classic Vehicle Show will be opened in Madrid, a meeting place for professionals and amateurs from the motor world.
The event will take place from 5 to 7 February 2010 in the Glass Pavilion of the Casa de Campo in Madrid.
It is an exhibition area of 20,000 square meters, on which more than 200 domestic and foreign exhibitors will be represented.
Here you will find not only classic motorcycles and cars, but in ClassicAuto Madrid also will be products of all types related to the world of engines.
Exhibitors in the pavilion will offer accessories, spare parts, components, textile accessories, accessories, publications, miniatures, etc.
Hundreds of products related to classic engines, real delicacies for collectors and curious.
Among the companies involved will be the following:Clásicos de Mos and Good Old Times, car sales; Juan Lumbreras, renovation; Coupe-Francisco Pueche, car sales and renovation; or Cochera Clásicos, a specialized company Mercedes Benz.
External proficiency tests
In addition, the commercial activity of this salon will be complemented by parallel activities: holding concentrations, sports performances, aptitude tests, presentations and competitions.
Eligibility tests will also be carried out on classic cars and motorcycles in an adapted circuit outside the exhibition zone.
Mazda3 i-Stop: Keeping Sporty
Mazda intends to show that environmentally friendly performance has no negative impact on sporty style.
That’s why Mazda3 also has a built-in stop and start system – also dubbed asi-Stop – which is currently available only with a 2.0-150 hp petrol engine.
This second generation Mazda3 is characterized by the good characteristics it has achieved as a whole.
Surface, vehicle design, habitability, behavior, mechanics, i-Stop system...
All these aspects are excellent in the Mazda3.
The front seats, including the driver’s seats, have excellent ergonomics and are well fixed.
The wheel is also extremely soft.
Using the toolkit and console, we conclude that Mazda continues the Japanese trend in developing a futuristic design with many buttons and drivers and a distinctive red and blue color.
This style reminds us in part of the style that also presents the Honda Civic.
Thus, we can say that both the Mazda3 and the Civic, both Japanese, contrast with the sobriety of German products and more specifically with the Volkswagen Golf, which everyone wants to beat.
As usual, this Japanese compact product represents more than enough space for four adults who want a very comfortable ride.
Additionally, a large luggage space and regular shapes should be mentioned.
The automatic stop and start system is currently only available with a two-litre gasoline engine and a 150 horsepower axle manual transmission.
This engine is a real delight. It is very gentle, characterized by reduced noise level, its power and lower consumption.
Although the most sought-after Mazda3 is in a diesel version, all those who do not drive so many kilometers a year should not rule out this i-Stop with a gasoline engine, as it features greater driving comfort and reduced consumption.
As for the equipment, the version selected for testing is called Sportive and includes a larger number of serial elements.
For standard equipment, it is necessary to mention the RVM system, which prevents the formation of a dead angle, traction and stability control, speed control, light-sensitive internal mirror, large screen on-board computer, parking sensors, separate air conditioning, rain and light sensor, bluetooth and bluetooth audio and 17-inch alloy wheels.
And if the equipment was not sufficient, this version was equipped withPack Premium, for an additional fee of 1,500 euros: adaptable two-xenon lights and the BOSE sound system with a CD holder, among other components.
Conclusion
The Mazda3 2.0 i-Stop is one of the most compact cars in its class.
It is characterized primarily by the quality of the materials used, its operation and the high level of equipment.
In addition, people who do not drive more miles per year can choose this i-Stop version, which is only with a 2.0 petrol engine and 150 horsepower.
The only disadvantage of this model is its higher price, which is 21.770 euros for the Luxury version and 23.270 euros for the tested version -Sportive-.
At this high price, the Mazda3 offers us a great dose of satisfaction for every day.
The “Premiere”
L.A. has a red carpet, soft as the hands of Penélope Cruz, Nicole Kidman and Fergie.
The stars blinked more than ever in the new elegant and sexy models of 'Nine' (Photo: Gtresonline).
Our 'Pe', extravagant as usual, chose the dark 'lady'.
FONPEEK PROMISE
Peek is extremely limited, serving only to view mail, without the possibility of viewing a certain type of attachment or surfing the network.
He his five minutes of fame in the U.S. when Time magazine named him one of the products of the year.
Seeing it outside is harder, but the idea can be interesting, especially for young people.
Unlike smartphones, Peek is characterized by a very low price and monthly payments, less than half the amount paid for, for example, an iPhone data plan.
Following its success, the company began offering two new devices: one is intended exclusively for Twitter, the other on the basis of a permanently provided free data service, but for which it needs to pay a six-fold amount for Peek.
FonPeek, which was presented at the Le Web event yesterday, is the European version of the invention and at the same time its third transformation.
He is limited just like his American counterpart, but brings a surprise.
The monthly maintenance fee is approximately EUR 12 per month and includes roaming across Europe.
People travelling with smartphones already know what it means to lose data services after crossing borders or to look impatiently for a cafe with WiFi (or Fon connection) to check out the mail.
The idea of rooming at a fixed price is incredibly attractive and should have been introduced long ago.
Yes, some operators have special contracts and travel plans, but in my experience one would need a Ph.D. in physics to understand them, and also very good glasses to read miniature letters.
The European Commission has repeatedly called for a reduction in roaming tariffs so that they are accessible across Europe, which still has no desired effect.
There is a reasonable concern about the use of data services outside the home country.
The fact that a device like FonPeek (interestingly, it still has the name Fon when it doesn’t have WiFi) reaches this type of tariff means that operators are beginning to think differently and consider various offers to compensate for their data network.
Kindle is another nice example, offering book downloads and other searches on the Internet.
No contracts, no complications.
This device is connected and paid at the time of purchase, not after months.
And that’s exactly what I expect to happen once in the case of FonPeek, it’s a permanent-access purchase option like that Peek has already introduced in the U.S.
Not because I want to buy it.
I checked the mail on the phone, thank you.
I expect it because I think it is the best type from the consumer’s point of view.
It would be interesting if the same system could also be used on a computer.
The Color Michelle Loves
Yellow is the first lady’s favorite color.
She chose the dress and coat in this colour for Barack Obama’s presidency, the same colour she also chose when she accompanied him at the second most important moment of his life: the award of the Nobel Peace Prize in Oslo.
Michelle Obama used very similar models in both cases: in addition to being a similar color — yellow-green with glowing effects — in both cases it was a three-piece set — a dress, a bag and a coat of the same fabric — decorated with a large brow or curl.
At first glance, it seemed that the First Lady of the United States decided to follow in the footsteps of the Princess of Asturias and wear similar clothes.
The material from which the clothes are made makes both models significantly different.
On the occasion of her admission to office, Michelle used a large chip, in Oslo a swab with a print.
It also changes accessories: green shoes with a medium-high heels, nowlike model, but in golden color.
She also wears different hairstyles: this timedrolled, previously dissolved hair.
75% of working mothers have work-related problems.
Discrimination in employment has increased in recent years, especially among younger women who intend to have a child.
This is the result of the study 'Fertility and Working Careers of Spanish Women' conducted by CSIC in collaboration with the Institute of Women.
The study involved 9,737 women aged 15 to 75 and the results are unambiguous: 75% of working mothers have limited opportunities on the labour market due to motherhood.
The study highlights that at the beginning of a partnership there are many differences in opinions about the number of children depending on whether they work or not, and also according to the type of employment.
Women who do not work outside of home, work part-time or do not have a stable job begin to live with their partner earlier, give birth to their first child earlier and generally have more children.
On the other hand, women with stable employment, especially in the public sector, postpone partnership and maternity, and have fewer offspring.
“Women aged 35 to 49 with stable employment have their first child on average 3.7 years from the beginning of their partnership.This figure is 4.1 in the case of women who have devoted most of their lives to achieving their stable employment and have therefore had to postpone their partnership and the arrival of children.
The type of profession also has a strong influence on maternity, although it has a smaller influence on the time of starting a life with a partner,” explains Margarita Delgado, a researcher at CSIC.
Another factor affecting the age of women at the time of marriage and the birth of a offspring is the degree of education.
The higher the level of education, the higher the age when women get married and have their first child.
There are also differences between women of the same generation.
For example, in the age group 35 to 49, women with primary and higher education gave birth to their first child at 25.1 and 32.1.
"There is another difference between women depending on their level of education.
Women with primary education marry and give birth to their first child before they can find a stable job, while women with secondary or higher education prefer to get a stable job before marrying and giving birth to their first child.”
Diane Kruger is worth it.
L’Oréal Paris has just added a new name to its prestigious list of women: Diane Kruger.
From next year, the German actress will become the face of various products of this brand under the universal slogan 'Because I am worth it'.
Joyeux Noël, one of the most elegant actresses on the international level, joins L’Oréal Paris’ other celebrities such as Linda Evangelista, Jane Fonda, Andie MacDowell, Eva Longoria and the Spanish Penélope Cruz.
Before she joined the club, the actresses Evangeline Lilly (Lost) and Freida Pinto (Millionaire from the Cottage) joined the club.
The male part of this cosmetic brand is also represented by prominent personalities: Patrick Dempsey ('Grey's Anatomy') and Matthew Fox (Evangelin's partner in 'The Lost').
British Fashion Prices
The British have a lot to say about fashion.
Their most prominent representatives – designers and models, past and present – gathered at the annual award ceremony held in London, at the Royal Court os Justice.
No one was missing at the meeting.
Former model Jerry Hall and her daughter Georgia May Jagger, who was voted the best model of the year.
Poker by Manuel Vicent
Manuel Vicent donates thirty X-rays of the writers he encountered in his literary life (and, in some cases, in his daily life) in 'Es poker' (Alfaguara, illustrated by Fernando Vicente).
He does not do so in fearful and predictable genres (biographical similarity, life and work), but he seeks something similar to the core of a creative personality.
The journey brings excitement, and Vicent doesn’t spare money or inspiration.
This book is an excellent reader’s pleasure, even with repeated reading.
Here I give some observations.
On the pages of this book I discovered that the Mediterranean is not a sea, but a spiritual impulse, almost physical, the same as what I feel, but cannot be named: the enjoyment of the opposite fate, the morality without guilt, and the innocence without any god.
About Samuel Beckett: “The Nihilist, an allegorical Christian, wrote by his own nature and not by his intellect, something between powerlessness and ignorance, with a blinding poetic humor, without meaning, as if it were the blade of a knife that killed him.”
About Graham Green: "Our man has been dominated by passion for this woman for thirteen years, adultery, pleasure and repentance, which is a spiritual privilege for reaching heaven by way of condemnation."
About James Joyce: "This Odyssey was published in Paris in 1922 by Sylvia Beach.It is one of the eight-thousand peaks in universal literature, which must be overcome from the north side, from which the best climbers often fall."
William Faulkner: “He was a strange man.
He said of himself that he was the heir of a landlord from the county, other times that he was the son of a black woman with a crocodile.
In both cases, it was a big dream.”
About Louis-Ferdinand Céline: "This writer captured on the bridge the blurred scream of this man from Munich to echo the night of the twentieth century in his literary form, running away from himself and crying into the future and speaking sharply to the worms."
About Dorothy Parker: “Once she kneeled and prayed, ‘My beloved God, tell me to stop writing as a woman.’
About Joseph Conrad: "On his grave were engraved Spenser's verses: 'After effort comes a dream, / after a storm a quiet harbor, / after a war rest, / after a full life death."
About Virginia Wolf: "He also carried his depression in his luggage.
The husband fully agreed to tell him that Edward VII was watching her among the Azales or that the birds were singing in Greek.
No man has ever been so patient and in love with a neuroscientist whose literary talent goes hand in hand with madness.
About Pío Baroja: "What else did Martin Santos do than focus Joyce on Baroja?
What else did Benet do than let Baroj be executed by Faulkner’s weapons?
What else did Celus do than make himself famous at the expense of that man’s fame?”
cowardly aggression
Last week, my seventy-year-old mother was walking through our neighborhood, in the Fuenlabrada district, and a group of young people aged 15 to 18 passed the sidewalk and our dog, a crucifix rescued from a shelter weighing no more than six kilograms, was twice struck and severely wounded without a word.
Our indignation is so much greater that we do not see anything funny in such an aggression towards a small and defenseless animal, which, in addition, was on the thread.
In addition, the old lady’s shock after this incident, when she encountered these individuals on a walk, began to worry about her own safety, for such a devil-obsessed man who attacked an animal is able to do the same to a woman, a child, an old man or anyone who is weaker than he himself.
It happened at five o’clock in the afternoon, on Tuesday, in a usually quiet neighborhood.
The dog was crying all day.
Of course, we have filed a complaint with the nearest commission, but we doubt that it was useful, and in order not to raise sensitive questions, we conclude that these cowardly killers were of Spanish nationality.
Our indignation prompted us to announce this fact.
We don’t understand what’s going on with today’s youth when it’s fun to bother the helpless animal that gives us love, companionship, and friendship.
We do not understand where the right upbringing, respect for animals and people has gone.
Michelin and Fesvial jointly for helmets
Michelin, in collaboration with the Spanish Foundation for Traffic Safety (Fesvial), has launched a campaign to encourage the use of helmets, especially among younger drivers, as both organizations have announced today.
The purpose of this initiative is to highlight the importance of helmet use, as it is the only way to prevent head injuries and deaths in the event of a motorcycle accident.
Michelin stated that this campaign is part of their commitment to traffic safety, which “means more than designing and manufacturing even safer products,” and confirmed that it is seeking to fulfill this purpose in other ways, i.e. through an instructional and information campaign.
This new campaign to promote the use of helmets while riding a motorcycle, under the slogan ‘To be or not to be’, is the first phase in which more than 500 repaired motorcycles will be displayed with signs to bring awareness to the wider public.
In conclusion, Michelin pointed out that traffic safety “is a constant concern” for this company, which is a manufacturer of tires for two-wheel vehicles and whose main objective is to constantly improve product safety.
Sales of light commercial vehicles are increasing
Almost two years later, the market for light commercial vehicles has begun to recover.
All 9,425 vehicles registered in November in Spain represented an increase of 12.6% compared to 2008 and, moreover, this is the first increase after 22 months of permanent decline, according to figures from the patronage organization of manufacturers Anfac and dealers Ganvam.
A favorable figure, however, is better put into quarantine, as November 2008 is a considerably bad period for comparison and meant a 60% decrease compared to the previous year.
As a result, despite the increase in the last month, the total number of registered vehicles over the last 11 months is 40% less than in the previous financial year.
As of January, 95,853 vehicles have been sold, which includes all possible vehicles falling within the category of light commercial vehicles: passenger car derivatives, pick-ups, trucks, smaller trucks and light trucks/chassis.
And the clouds, which are the most damaging to demand, have not disappeared, even if they were purchased by private persons, most of the purchases were made by smaller and medium-sized companies, and 100% of the cases are financing through third parties.
Additional factors, such as the cessation of activity or the continuation of a poor economic situation, should be added to the restrictions resulting from the closure of bank loans.
In this situation, unlike passenger cars, the support for buying the 2000E did not help much.
In addition to private persons, it is necessary to mention small and medium-sized enterprises that intend to purchase a light commercial vehicle up to 3.5 tons with a CO2 emission level not exceeding 160 grams per kilometer, but the number of operations has been confirmed.
Just yesterday, Ganvam reiterated the need to pay special attention to the management of these vehicles as well as industrial vehicles (trucks and buses).
The Association of Dealers predicts that in 2010 the development will be similar to last year and according to calculations sales for passenger cars and 4x4 will decline by 19%.
The manual brake system is now mandatory.
As with the ABS anti-blocking system, the ESP stability control and manual brake assistance systems will become mandatory for European cars.
In fact, it already forms part of the mandatory equipment of all newly registered passenger cars and light commercial vehicles, while for the rest, the deadline is February 2011.
The measures introduced in the EU aim to improve the protection of pedestrians, while working in a way that can help prevent many collisions.
The manual brake assistance system increases the pressure on the brakes in an emergency, which is detected by the system after the driver steps down.
But it’s not always possible to keep this pressure up to the end.
According to a study conducted by automotive parts manufacturer Bosch, one-third of drivers who have an accident did not squeeze the brake before a collision, and half of them did not use the brake power to the fullest.
Up to 1,100 accidents
On the contrary, this assistance requires the maximum from the braking system, shortening the braking distance of the vehicle.
According to a study conducted in the EU alone, if all vehicles were equipped with this type of equipment, up to 1,100 pedestrian-related fatalities could be avoided annually.
The reduction of this number will be even more pronounced – according to calculations one in four accidents affecting people would be avoided – after the introduction of so-called smart manual braking systems.
In this case, vehicles will be equipped with a system that (using radar or camera) captures obstacles and reports them to the driver, in addition to light braking.
If the driver reacts, it will help him increase the pressure on the pedal if necessary.
If the driver does not respond, even if the collision cannot be avoided, the device will impact the brake as intensely as possible and reduce the risk of damage to a minimum.
General Motors delays plans for Opel
Nick Reilly, the new president of General Motors (GM) Europe, told Opel employees in Figueruelas (Zaragoza) that production of the new Meriva will start in the first week of April - probably April 8 - as Javier Ortega informed, the U.S. manufacturer warns that it will need more time to meet the rebuilding plan for Opel.
Nick Reilly, the new chairman of GM Europe, is trying to ensure that every point of the plan is first agreed with the party concerned.
As a result, it can happen that the final document, which will first be submitted to the employees and then to the governments of the individual countries in which the production plants are located, will be issued with a delay at the beginning of 2010.
GM, on the other hand, assures that the decision to sell Saab should be made in these days.
No wonder the Swedish government has increased pressure on the American manufacturer to make a certain decision as soon as possible.
GM allows contacts with some new potential buyers.
One of them could be Geely, which also wants to acquire Volvo, but is considering the possibility of the Dutch sports car maker Skyper, which operates under the auspices of the Russian Converg group.
If it is not possible to negotiate with any of them, GM could sell some of Saab’s assets to the Chinese company Baic.
Saab will be closed by the end of the year if its sale fails.
Porsche Boxster Spyder
In the development of this great model, Porsche engineers used the Boxster S as the basis and managed to reduce the weight by 80 kg, thus the weight shows only 1,275 kg.
Based on this, in the first place, the automatic withdrawal roof is in a canvas version with manual control, thereby reducing the weight by 21 kg; further aluminum doors such as GT3 were used, which means another 15 kg less; removal of air conditioning, 13; reducing the fuel tank from 64 to 54 liters also contributed to the weight reduction by another 7 kg; after the installation of sports seats, another 12 kg, thanks to the lightweight 19 inch wheels, another five kilograms.
Finally, removing the CDR-30 audio system means another six kilograms less, and replacing the door sticks with textile sticks means an additional kilogram.
Also available with the PDK double-connector transmission, one car with a hand-held six-speed gearbox has been tested, mainly on second-class roads in California, on mountainous sections with many twists.
His behavior can only be qualified as inviolable.
Reducing the weight does not mean that the vehicle is not pressed to the asphalt.
Rather, the opposite: we have not tested such a small and lightweight model for a long time, which would also deliver such safety when moving in turns, even at high speeds.
He is a small athlete able to warm up the muscles in a short ride for the necessary time until he is ordered to sprint, brake, and restore the use of the engine.
With the driving that is as communicative as accurate, whatever we indicate with our hands on the steering wheel is what the car will do.
This is done with surgical precision.
Sound of the engine
The sound of the V6 boxer, with 320 horsepower (10 more than the Boxster S) is very successful and can be enhanced by the 'sport' option and through a system that modifies the sound of the engine that was previously used in the Panamera.
The acceleration capacity is brutal, whether during suction or recovery.
The curtains are firm, but not hard or uncomfortable.
The asphalt of the roads we passed with the Boxster Spyder was quite damaged, but the car managed the mole well.
Electronic support was almost unnecessary during the ride; and yet, in some turns, we encountered frost and shrimp at dawn, even in the advanced morning.
Definitely this ultra-light car is one of the funniest on the market, as it’s a little more than just a Boxster S modification.
The car will go on sale in February 2010 at a price of 70.831 euros.
“Bag Girl”
A girlfriend of Karl Lagerfeld, an icon of the Coco Cocoon series and an occasional 'starlette' at the 'firmy' shows, the singer presents her face of the evil girl as vehemently as her Chanel bags.
More than ‘Bad Girl’ or ‘It Girl’, it’s ‘Bag Girl’.
Baskonia wins in Israel
Workers gained a brilliant victory in 82-91 during their hosts on the complicated Maccabi Electra field, despite numerous absences in the team Duska Ivanovice, and thus came to the forefront of their group after the great performance of Mirza Teletovice, who with eight triple points was proclaimed the best in the team (29 reviews).
The Viktoria team was able to replace the significant absence of Hermann, Oleson, Huertas or Micov with a great deal of dedication and collective work, although they had to suffer to the end to win.
In addition, the high accuracy from the 16 triple-point circuit contributed a lot to the final triumph.
The match began with the front for the blue, who from the beginning stood on the mark.
That the first four baskets for Vitorii were from a distance already indicated that they attacked the Israeli team very hard.
English and Teletovic were among the main shooters 18-20 at the end of the first half.
The second quarter was similar, but the Alavian team chose the internal play of Barac and the work of Eliyahu, who was received with whispers and applause when returning to their original place of play to increase the advantage before the start of the break (34-43).
Teletovic had already begun to show up as the best in his team with 13 points, although 'without six' in Splitter's rating already suggested that it would not be the best evening for the Brazilians.
But although the match was sharp until the break, it was not decided in the slightest, and the Maccabeans wanted to remind Vitorius that not everyone wins on their pitch, and 'the hand of Elías' they were able to win.
Eidson and Pnini made a decisive contribution to bringing the 'yellow' back to the outline (50-49).
More inappropriate
The members of Ivanovic, injured but not dead at all, needed a few precise games to take their breath, and then the Mirza Teletovic machine gun appeared, which with three triples almost in a row and with the help of Englishe and Ribas returned the score to a reassuring number (54-67), which the local reached at the end of the third quarter (57-67).
English and San Emeterio (60-75) have already announced that they will not allow anyone to take away the deserved results of the first thirty minutes.
However, Pnini and Eidson, the best in their team, did not give up and tried to keep the team alive from the three-point line (70-77).
Despite this and with Splitter excluded for faul, Ivanovic did not rush and defended well, and although the Israelis approached the final minute (80-85), the match already had a winner and Tel Aviv lost for the first time in the season.
Injuries make it impossible for Unicaja to fight
Unicaja lost significantly in Greece against Olympiacos, leaving him the lead in Group B in the EuroLeague match, which was marked by three attacks by Unicaja, but above all by an internal game (Freeland, Lima and Archibald), which facilitated the Greek victory.
The team of Malaga did not laugh at the environment of the Pavilion of Peace and Friendship or an opponent, one of the sickest in Europe, and with a large budget.
Aggressive defense and three triple points in a row, two thanks to Omar Cook and one thanks to Guillem Rubio, illuminated the field s12-18, minute 9.
Olympiacos was surprised by the intensity of Unicaja, although the arsenal of the locals in an internal game with Bourousis, Vujcic and Schortsanitis turned the score 22-20, minute 13, which was the moment when the battle between the backers from USABeverley and Williams meant the exclusion of both players.
The Greek team began to function and proved its superiority in both zones, where the absence of the English pivot due to the injury of Joel Freeland and three personal mistakes of Carlos Jiménez burdened the Unicaja team.
Between the domestic players and Lithuanian wing Linas Kleizas with three points increased the advantage to 44-32, minute 19.
Impossible Revenge
The third half was very offensive on the part of Olympiacos, who despite losing by 19, showed superiority and even managed to balance the difference from the match in Malaga Málaga 66-48, minute 27, which shaken the leadership in the group.
Unicaja tried to overcome the absence and last absence of Scottish pitcher Robert Archibald, who injured himself in the last match.
Despite all the disadvantages Unicaja thanks to the leadership and triple points of Cook and the contribution of Lewis left a certain hope n win 66-57, minute 31.
But it was practically impossible, because Olympiacos, thanks to the reinforcement and superiority in centimeters in its zone, proved to be unstoppable.
The Croatian pivot Nikola Vujcic, managed to balance the basketball average 81-62, minute 37, and Unicaja shattered and passed the lead to Olympiacos.
How much should you pay for your Facebook profile?
Facebook users can get acquainted with the salary they deserve for their profile, thanks to the new Trovit app, the search engine with the largest number of sorted real estate, employment and motor vehicle ads in Spain.
The How Much Should You Take? tool calculates users’ salaries based on more than 140,000 job offers available to Trovit in Spain, using a form available on Facebook to enter the profession, years of experience, age and the city where the applicant wants to work.
During the week the app works, the search engine found that the Spanish worker generally “feels poorly remunerated,” explained in his report Albert Rivera, responsible for the Trovit product.
According to data available to Trovit from its search engines in the UK and France, Spaniards are the worst paid.
A British programmer receives 45,226 euros gross per year and a Frenchman 31,059, while a Spanish receives 24,000.
Likewise, the driver has a net salary of 34,247 euros per year in England, 25,751 in France and 16,420 in Spain.
According to Trovit, the worst paid job in Spain is a waitress with €11,592 net per year, followed by a salesman with €14,725 and a worker with €15,667 net.
The most sought-after jobs on the network in the last three months are driver, part-time jobs and social worker.
Brazil sets deadline for Zelay's departure
The Brazilian government has set a deadline for Manuel Zelaya to stay at his embassy in Tegucigalpa.
The President must leave the diplomatic mission by January 27, 2010, when his term of office officially ends.
Francisco Catunda, chargé d'affaires of the Brazilian embassy in the Honduran capital, confirmed to TV Globo that "Mel" knows he must leave the embassy by this date, where he has been hiding since September 21.
"He is aware that on January 27, after the end of his term, he will have to leave and look for another refuge."
The station also quoted a former statesman who confirmed his intention to leave the embassy before the specified deadline: "I intend to leave as soon as possible, logically under the auspices of the Brazilian government," Zelaya said by phone.
After the November 29 election (when Porfirio Lobo was elected) Zelaya assured that he would remain at the Brazilian embassy until January.
However, the same week he sought refuge in Brazil.
The operation eventually failed because Zelaya rejected the condition of political asylum that the "de facto" government chaired by Roberto Micheletti was trying to impose on him.

After the days of wine and roses since last spring, when asset inflation represented the prevailing mood in the markets, uncertainty has reappeared in the markets, which should not be surprising, as it is already a natural state in an environment where actors make decisions about the future that is uncertain in itself.
The remedy used by central banks to stabilize the market was to monetize debt by directly buying assets and indirectly releasing liquidity at a rate close to zero so that financial institutions could buy assets for deduction.
Central banks have already confirmed that direct asset purchases have virtually ended, and without questioning their disproportionate liquidity policy, they are beginning to throw a little sand into private money, as the Spanish Central Bank did with its auction last year.
Investors thus question the ability of the world economy to sustain economic recovery without such heterodox measures, and we are participating in the return of reduced risk returns.
Exchange mobility and corporate bond differences have regained points, although they are still very far from the abnormal levels they reached at the beginning of the year.
States were forced to socialize private risk, which again affected public debt.
The pressure on quality is again being pushed, and the US, Japan, and Germany have become the refuge chosen by investors, thus expanding the differentiation of the eurozone countries against Germany.
Spain was hardly affected by this instability, but at the time, Standard & Poor's came in and threatened a new revision to reduce the Spanish Kingdom's qualification.
On the other hand, some uncertainty is not useless for silencing the advocates of moral risk, who have tried again to burden the consciences of those responsible for world economic policy in order to curb the devastating consequences of reducing credit to employment, when in fact a new Thanksgiving would have to be declared.
However, the situation in Dubai represents tribal struggles between emirates for the restoration of power in the emirates, and as far as Greece is concerned, we have seen this before.
A government that covers the deficit, elections and a new government is coming in.
Prodi did it in Italy after Berlusconi and Socrates in Portugal after Durão Barros.
It makes no sense for the Ecofin to save Hungary from failing to pay foreign payments at the beginning of the year and to allow the euro member country to fail to meet its obligations.
What makes sense, however, is that Ecofin will force the Greek government to be transparent and commit its own citizens to shared responsibility for the need for emergency measures to maintain the stability of its public finances.
If, as we expect, we are ahead of the period of normalization of transitional risk premiums, after some excesses on supported positions would be within expectation.
In the Spanish case, while our public debt differences will increase as well as the bonds of European companies, we don’t have to worry.
If the European differences decrease and our differences continue to expand, it would be a typically Spanish risk.
When our leading indicators force most study services to anticipate their recovery scenarios and revise their upward scenario for 2011, including the OECD and the European Commission, to return to the Japanese scenario, it does not offer much hope for the Spanish economy to live up to this warning.
Again, it looks like this will be a great opportunity to buy Spanish assets, though for the time being "be careful, friends drivers".

Iberdrola President Ignacio Sánchez Galán was the first to intervene before a sub-committee of the House of Representatives, where he discussed Spain’s energy strategy for the next two decades.
Following his intervention, followed by a speech by Gas Natural-Fenos President Rafael Villaseca, Galán submitted several comments to the press on the proposal he submitted to the subcommittee behind closed doors.
According to President Iberdrol, Spain needs an investment of €50,000 million by 2020 and another €60,000 million from that date to 2030, if the nuclear power plants that are currently in operation areined.
If this is not done, the necessary investment will not be 60,000 million but up to 95,000 million.
In fact, Iberdrola believes that investment in the next decade must focus not on increasing production capacity, but on distribution networks and international interconnections.
From 2020, the issue is changing and performance will need to be increased.
Its offer focuses on gas plants and coal-fired power plants with carbon capture mechanisms and, above all, on renewable energy.
In this case, it believes that new 18,000 MW are needed, but with other "supportive energies".
Galán, who believes the government-approved Sustainable Economy Bill corresponds to the line the business was demanding, did not want to let go of it as a royal decree to promote the consumption of national coal that contradicts climate policy.
In his opinion, there is a “clear long-term bet” in this sense, despite the “precise” measures, as they were called by President Iberdrola.
Whatever it is, Galán believes that investment decisions, although long-term, must begin to be made now, because they are maturing and a stable tax framework is needed to start them.
Ferrovial wins ‘handling’ at Aer Lingus at 10 airports
Ferrovial’s subsidiary for airport ground services, Swissport, will play the role of the preferred partner of Irish airlines Aer Lingus for cargo services at ten European airports where it is present.
Paris, London, Frankfurt or Brussels are among the most important of them.
The agreement, which has not yet expired, is valid for five years.
On the other hand, Ferrovial, the Junta Castile-La Mancha and the University of Alcalá de Henares yesterday signed a cooperation protocol to establish a Centre for Intelligent Infrastructure Innovation
The association predicts an investment of 20 million by 2012, of which 50% will fall to Ferrovial.
One of the tasks of the center will be research on energy efficiency on motorways and airports.
Acciona seeks its first motorway in Australia against Hochtief and Bouygues
Acciona is fighting for its first concession on the motorway in Australia, a market where it already operates as an energy and water company.
The construction of the tunnel is estimated at 1.700 million Australian dollars (about 1.047 million euros).
Its rivals are the French company Bouygues and the German Hochtief.
The 5-kilometer tunnel in the Australian city of Brisbane on the eastern coast has become the nearest option for Acciona to settle in the country as a construction and concession motorway company.
The tunnel is expected to be completed by the end of 2014.
After selecting the public-private cooperation (PPP) for the further development of the project in the business plan protected by Erns & Young, the administration already has a final list of candidates for the implementation of the construction and operation of the toll.
Offers are expected to be submitted in May, with an estimated investment of 1,700 million Australian dollars (€1.047 million) and in the final phase competing three companies with a significant presence in European construction.
The group, called Transcity, is led by Acciona, the only Spanish company in the competition, and its partners are BMD and Ghella.
The first is one of the largest Australian construction companies and the second, based in Italy, is one of the largest European specialists in underground construction.
Northern Direct is in the game with the presence of British Laing O'Rourke, Australian infrastructure manager Transfield and French construction group Bouygues.
The third and final group that went through the grid is called LBRJV and includes Australian capital Leighton (a subsidiary of the German construction company Hochtief, here represented by ACS), also local Baulderstone (owned by the German Bilfinger Berger Group) and a major civil construction firm Razel.
The Australian infrastructure market promises large-scale construction and privatization, but it brings with it a clear difficulty of entering otherwise than through the acquisition of a local construction company.
The strategy that was followed by Hochtief or Bilfinger, in addition to Asian references, is still an example for the Spanish giants in the sector.
ACS acquired a market position through its 30% stake in Hochtief, the owner of the quoted Leighton.
million assets
Acciona is betting on the geographical area with the greatest importance for the sector, where it already has a significant presence through its activity as an energy supplier and in the trade of desalination.
Among other assets, it has the largest wind farm in Waubra (192 MW) in Victoria and runs a group of companies that build and manage desalination facilities in Adelaide with a budget of 700 million.
Its plan is now to consolidate these two areas and use the joint energy to enter the areas of construction and infrastructure operation.
Brisbane City Infrastructure Authority’s underground road, called the Northern Link, connects the western highway from Toowong to the Kelvin Grove Circuit Route (see map) with a tunnel length of 5 kilometers. This is Brisbane’s largest action to reduce traffic congestion.
The calendar set by the local administration is scheduled for the summer of 2010 and the start of work in December next year.
Although this paid passage would open in the last months of 2014, the full completion of the work is planned only in 2016.
The tunnel was started in 2005.
It will include two streams in each direction, an electronic toll system and a comprehensive ventilation system.
The Queensland government will provide 500 million Australian dollars (308 million euros) to finance it.
Brisbane has already offered this contract to Hochtief
Australia still brings Hochtief a significant profit, as it announced a deal with the government estimated at 154 million yesterday.
The shareholding ACS will operate the infrastructure of the national fiber-optic broadband network through its local Leighton subsidiary.
This situation will allow fast internet access to 400,000 people and provide the work of the German company for 18 months.
On the other hand, the company left the 27-storey King George Tower building project in Brisbane, Australia. Construction work had just begun and Hochtief closed the sale for 129 million.
In the UK, specifically in Manchester, he will participate with Laing O'Rourke in the construction and operation of two school centers for 25 years.
The initial investment will be €75 million.
FCC awarded a tunnel in Slovenia for 64 million
Through its subsidiary Alpine, the FCC has acquired an allocation for the construction of a 2.1-kilometer tunnel for the highway in Slovenia worth EUR 64.5 million.
The company obtained the contract a few days after the works were carried out to expand the tunnel in Bosrucko (Austria) for 130 million.
In this way, Alpine strengthens its experience in the construction of tunnels.
The start of the work is scheduled for the beginning of 2010 and the deadline for implementation is 32 months.
Ms. Rushmore gets advertisement in Renfe
Renfe has allocated advertising and marketing services to Ms. Rushmore over the past two years for approximately three million euros a year, the railway company said.
Ms. Rushmore was selected among the 16 agencies that appeared in the Renfe competition, of which four went to the final, including TBWA, which was responsible for creating advertising for the last three years.
From this point on, Ms. Rushmore will take care of the design and production of the campaigns.
France Télécom fined $63 million for blocking competition
The competition regulator in France has fined France Télécom €63 million for anti-competitive behavior in the Caribbean regions that belong to the country.
According to the institution, the operator restricted the competition of fixed and mobile phones by signing exclusive agreements, pricing plans and consumer loyalty programs on the edge of regulation.
With this sanction, the former French monopoly and still a state-owned company bought more than €560 million in fines since 1994 for placing obstacles to its competitors.
The fine imposed yesterday was de facto increased because the competition authority considers that France Télécom has committed a similar offence as in the past and that there has therefore been a recurrence.
App Store
On the other hand, the mobile branch of the French company is still a star among other operators and has opened an app store on the Internet in order to increase revenues that will not come from voice transmissions.
From the start, the Orange app store will be active in France and the UK.
It will have to wait until 2010 to join other countries such as Spain.
Playing in the Champions League has brought 476.4 million to Madrid and Barca since the beginning
The Champions League has been a source of revenue for these clubs since its inception in 1992.
To the extent that Real Madrid and Barcelona have earned 476.4 million since then, making them the third and fifth most profitable club in the competition.
The list is run by Manchester United.
The list is run by Manchester United.
Winning the UEFA Champions League doesn’t just bring fame, it’s also one of the main sources of income for big clubs.
To the extent that the competition has distributed €5.362.5 million between 105 teams (of which 12 are Spanish) that have participated in the event since the start of the tournament in the 1992/1993 season, according to UEFA data.
Real Madrid and F.C. Barcelona are very good at this division.
The White Club was the third on the continent with the most money earned for participation, and the only along with AC Milan to win the main prize three times.
The current Catalan champion and last winner of the disappeared European Cup in 1992 is fifth in the classification.
The list is headed by Manchester United and Bayern Munich, the two teams that have charged the most for participation in the previous Champions League.
Both of them lost to Barca.
On the other hand, Spain is the third country to earn the most money through Champions, despite winning the most titles of all (five against four for Italy, three for England and two for Germany).
Distribution
This apparent paradox is explained by the complex procedure for the distribution of money used by UEFA.
For this fiscal year, the body, chaired by Michel Platini, plans to earn 1,090 million for the Champions League.
Of this money, UEFA is giving 413,1 million to fixed payments: each of the 20 clubs that participated in the preliminary qualifying round (among other things, Atlético Madrid) received 2.1 million.
In addition, those who achieved participation received 3.8 million for their presence alone, plus an additional 550,000 euros for each match they participated in.
There is also a prize for the win (800,000 euros) and for the draw (400,000 for each team). Eight finalists will receive three million each; eight quarterfinals3,3 million.
Each of them will get 4 million.
The champion earned 9 million, while the second finalist earned 5.2 million.
Thus, on fixed payments the club will earn a minimum of 7.1 million and a maximum of 31.2 million.
On the other hand, Barça earned 2.5 million for winning the European Super Cup in August.
In addition, there are variable payments for which 337.8 million euros are allocated.
This money is divided by the proportional value of each television market.
Spanish is one of the main and has four assigned places.
Last year’s champion will receive 40% of the money allocated, the second 30%, the third 20% and the fourth 10%.
The second part will be paid according to the number of matches that will be played this year.
Nueva Rumasa offers €61 million for 29.9% Sos
Nueva Rumasa Group yesterday released details of an offer to buy shares with which it wants to gain the top spot between 25% and 29.9% of Sos’s capital.
This percentage does not commit to making a public offer for the acquisition (option) of all securities.
Specifically, Nueva Rumasa offers €1.5025 per share, which it would pay in ten years and for which it would pay interest for this deferral1% annually.
Yesterday, Sos shares ended trading at 1.85 euros; thus, the Nueva Rumasa offer rated the company 18% below market value.
According to Nueva Rumasa, the price of 1.50 euros reflects the real value of Sos.
The proposal is subject to the appointment of eight of the 15 members of the Board.
The Jerez Group provides a period of 15 days for shareholders to declare their interest in selling the shares.
CNMV said it had not been informed of the offer, although Ruiz Mateos confirmed that it had contacted the regulatory authority.
If the purchase is made, the price would reach 611.7 million, while the Sos capitalization is 254.27 million.
In the meantime, they are changing their leadership structure.
As an attempt to stay on the edge of possible buy-offs and to offset the judicial fluctuations of his former leaders, the brothers Jesus and Jaime Salazar, the election of Maria Luisa Jordá as head of internal audit was announced.
This decision makes her the first woman to hold a senior position in the food business.
It is a newly created place that will be directly subordinated to the President of the Group.
And it is not exempt from the controversy as the company continues to be immersed in a legal battle for the alleged transfer of more than 230 million from Sos to the companies of the Salazar brothers.
The de facto cannot be ruled out the possibility that the Sos will reveal new fund transfers in the coming months
As for the Salazar credit, yesterday former board members Ildefonso Ortega and Ángel Fernández Noriega (representatives of CCM and Unicaja) testified before the National Court and confirmed that they had approved the transfer of 212 million without knowing where they were destined.
CNMV allows the option to exclude Paternina, which participated in Inversor Mer
The National Securities Market Commission (CNMV) yesterday authorized the exclusion, involving Investor Mer, against Federico Paternino on October 9.
The Supervisory Authority explained that it authorizes this operation because it understands that its conditions correspond to the applicable standards and considers that the explanatory content of the brochure submitted after the amendments introduced on 2 December is “sufficient.”
CNMV specified that the offer is aimed at acquiring 550.008 shares of Federica Paternina at a price of 7.65 euros per share, representing 8.95% of the company’s capital, which is made up of 6.142.786 shares admitted to trading on the Madrid and Bilbao stock exchanges.
Furthermore, he explained that 5,592,778 million shares had been displaced, which could not be transferred in any way until an offer was concluded, which specified that the price was determined by Federica Paternina in accordance with the provisions of the applicable standards.
New Vehicle Pricing Tools
In these days of storms and accidents, not only car workshops make money.
Every day, thousands of cars that have suffered an accident are dragged to a service center where an expert must estimate the damage and cost of repairs.
No insurance event is the same and calculating the cost of parts and labor time can be a long and complicated job.
To manually calculate the cost of repair from 20,000 to 30,000 euros including parts and labour can take two or three hours.
However, with the support of new computer tools, this would be a matter of minutes.
Therefore, almost 100% of experts use this type of system.
Insurance event estimation and maintenance service providers and solutions are dedicated to collecting information provided to them by manufacturers to then develop and offer their customers a useful tool.
In Spain, Audatex, from the American group Solera is the leading company; 80% of the ratings are made with its products.
Other companies that compete in the field of pricing and sector information tools are GtMotive and Eurotax.
Working with the data provided by the manufacturers is not easy at all.
According to Eduard Velázquez, Sales Director of Audatex, they work in Spain with 63 manufacturers and importers, and each of them provides them with information in a different format.
In addition, the amount of data to be processed continues to grow, as more versions, variants and engine solutions have been listed in the last five years than in the previous fifteen years.
As soon as a new vehicle enters the market, these enterprises will start working.
This is a very fierce work, as it is necessary to catalog each of the thousands of parts of a vehicle and determine its price.
In addition, "smart" graphics processing is carried out for each model, where it is possible to "pick out" individual parts of touring cars.
As for a model with massive sales, the work can be done in a week, if the process is very fast.
As for a minority car, it can take three or four months. Currently, Audatex has complete information available about 99.2% of the cars sold in Spain.
Among the most exclusive models they have information about are Porsche, but not, for example, Ferrari or Lamborghini.
The number of vehicles in circulation exceeds 99%.
Audatex has eight centers worldwide (Spain, France, Germany, USA, Brazil, Mexico, China and Japan) that specialize in specific brands.
The headquarters is in Alcobendas (Madrid).
There, more than a hundred technicians (normally mechanics experts) work simultaneously with three computer screens.
Audatex invests 90 million euros annually in the development of these databases.
Each month, 2.5 million data are listed and customers receive updates every two days.
Processing this enormous flow of information enables to use and deliver different products differently.
The most common use focuses on repairs and maintenance, but there are also tools for controlling spare parts or for calculating a car’s sales or residual value, depending on the country.
The only company that has a guide that informs about the value of used vehicles in Spain is Eurotax.
Audatex does not offer them in our country, but in the United States yes.
Given the products offered by Audatex, it’s easy to get support that professionals in the sector can benefit from.
The company offers ten different tools, with the star product being AudaPlus, a standard insurance event award solution designed for experts.
It includes automobiles, motorcycles and light and heavy industrial vehicles.
In addition to the cost of parts, it also includes the repair time estimated by the manufacturer or the paintmaker.
This tool is paid by use for each assessment.
The highest price is 5.75 euros for customers who use it little, a maximum of ten times a month.
Then every insurance company that makes thousands of estimates negotiates its price with Audatex.
Other products such as AudaVIN allow for complete identification of the vehicle and equipment with which it came out of the assembly line only on the basis of the first chassis number.
AudaGlass focuses on vehicle glass and AudaSubastas is an open service for the professional sector on the Internet that allows you to discharge vehicles with a total insurance event.
Its statistical service is very useful for identifying a trend, performing geodemographic analyses or detecting deviations by brands or models.
For example, it is possible to study how many modelsa particular brand has undergone service due to an accident or how many have suffered serious insurance incidents over a certain period.
Gt Motive is the only Spanish company dedicated to the development of this type of tools.
Among other things, it sells Gt Estimate, which is also intended for experts and also provides digital images, access to parts or prices and official times of the manufacturer.
Gt Motive is a company of the Einsa Group founded in 1971 as a provider of services and solutions for the assessment of damage, accident or maintenance of automobiles.
Gt Guía Awarding is its reference historical product on the market.
They work with 24,000 service users, 3,100 experts and 53 insurance companies.
The turnover has grown by 20% annually over the last three years and was charged EUR 10.8 million in 2008.
At the beginning of last year, the process of internationalization of the installation of the Paris office began.
Audatex was founded in Germany in 1966 and established in Spain in 1979.
According to the company's sources, 62% of her brother originates in Europe and 38% in North and South America. She works with 900 insurance companies and 33,000 services, of which 3,000 in Spain.
The global billing of the Solera Group (Audatex, Sidexa, Informex ABZ, Hollander and IMS) will reach $557 million, which is 3.3% more than in 2008.
In our country, the company will earn 19.1 million euros, which is 7.2% more than last year.
In 2005, the Solera Group was worth $1,000 million and now its shares are estimated at a total value of $2,400 million.
Since 2007, it has been listed on the New York Stock Exchange and is included in the Standard & Poor's index.
Internet auction of crashed vehicles
Last October, Solera Group acquired Autoonline, an online base for the sale of cars and motorcycles or special vehicles after an insurance event.
The transaction envisaged the subscription of €59.5 million out of 85% of the company’s capital, which could expand next year by the remaining 15%.
The purpose of the acquisition was to provide more value-added services to customers with access to a huge international market.
This pricing and purchase and sale service is exclusively for professionals in the sector such as insurance companies, experts, rental companies, service providers, sales of spare parts and professional sellers who must register before starting operations.
The platform was founded in 1996 in Germany and manages more than 650,000 operations across Europe, of which 500,000 in Germany.
Among the main markets are Spain, Greece, Poland and Turkey.
The site currently has more than 1,500 registered dealers and 4,000 experts.
It manages 3,000 daily ads and about 100 new ads are added to the Spanish market every day.
Under Spanish law, a car whose chassis number has been discarded cannot be returned to operation, but can be used as a source of spare parts that have not been damaged.
Vehicles of historical value may be allowed to operate, even if they have been discarded, following preliminary proceedings.
Service Budget in 4 Steps
With the Auda-Taller tool, Audatex guarantees that the user gets a budget in just four steps: identifying the vehicle, finding a spare part, creating a budget, and generating a budget.
The ease of use is a prerequisite for these systems, especially for the persuasion of older professionals who, to a greater or lesser extent, tend to be reluctant to use new driving techniques.
The database contains 1,034 vehicles, including 666, 109 off-road vehicles, 137 motorcycles, 78 vans and 44 trucks.
Naturally, a computer with an Internet connection is required for use.
After identifying the model to be repaired, using the chassis number, a real graphic display of the model will appear, and then the necessary spare part will be selected.
The user can include variables such as labour price, surcharges or discounts, and then print and pass on to the customer.
AudaTaller is not a valuation tool like AudaPlus, but rather a reference catalog.
The main difference between the two systems is that it is service-oriented and does not include a workforce estimate.
The cost of using this tool for the workshop is 350 euros per year, which the customer can fund.
Currently, Audatex is working to make these views three-dimensional.
This is an innovation that mechanics welcome because it will allow, for example, to select the doors and turn them to show the inside.
