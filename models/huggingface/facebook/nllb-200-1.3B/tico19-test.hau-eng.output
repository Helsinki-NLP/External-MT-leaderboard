The risk of coronavirus (COVID-19) is increasing in the European Union/Economic Area and the UK, from 1 January to 15 March 2020
The case of the Coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak reflects a similar trend in the European Union/European Economic Area and the United Kingdom which confirms that, while at a different level depending on the country, the COVID-19 epidemic is progressing rapidly in all countries.
Based on evidence from Italy, countries, hospitals and intensive care units should increase their preparedness for the increasing number of COVID-19 patients who will require medical care, and especially intensive care.
On 31 December 2019, a new outbreak of pneumonia of unknown genetic origin was reported in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
On 9 January 2020, the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention reported that the agent was a new coronavirus that was classified as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-COV-2).
Since then, the disease causing the SARS-CoV-2 infection has been classified as a coronavirus (COVID-19).
Evidence to date is that over 80% of people with COVID-19 have mild respiratory infections with or without pneumonia, and many of these are recovering.
In 14% of cases, COVID-19 develops into a serious illness requiring hospitalization while a further 6% are experiencing a serious illness requiring intensive care.
The hospital-acquired mortality rate due to COVID-19 is over 4%.
In this study, we assess the variation in the incidence of COVID-19 in each European Union/EEA Member State and the United Kingdom (UK) and compare them to those in Hubei Province, China.
We also compare the number of COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA and UK countries with those in Italy during the period 31 January - 15 March 2020.
COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA and UK countries
After China, COVID-19 continues to spread to various countries and the rapid spread of COVID-19 epidemics in the rest of the world is currently following this country.
On 11 March 2020, the Director General of the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 as a pandemic.
In the March 5th issue of Eurosurveillance 2020, Spiteri et al. reported the first confirmed European case of COVID-19 based on the WHO case profile.
Within the EU/EEA, France reported the first three cases of the virus on 24 January 2020 in people returning from Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
As of 15 March 2020, COVID-19 cases have been detected in all 30 EU/EEA countries and the UK, with between 31 December 2019 and that date inclusive, 39,768 new infections and 1,727 deaths reported, with 17,750 cases and 1,441 deaths from Italy alone.
Collect the number and event collections of COVID-19 patients
At the European Regional Centre for Disease Control (ECDC), the official COVID-19 statistics in every country in the world, obtained only from official sources such as national health ministries, national health authorities and WHO and WHO, are updated daily at 8:00 a.m.
These data were used to assess the characteristics of COVID-19 in the EU/EEA and the UK, and compared them to those of Italy.
As a representative of the COVID-19 case trends, we counted 14 days of cumulative decrease in the COVID-19 case trends, thus taking into account the COVID-19 trend in each EU/EEA country and the UK, between 1 January - 15 March 2020.
We also presented a compilation of the case-by-case data for each country on 15 March 2020 at 8:00 am compared to Italy on 31 January - 15 March 2020.
COVID-19 trend in EU/EEA countries and the UK
The 14 day cumulative incidence of COVID-19 infection in EU/EEA countries and the UK as a whole was followed by Hubei Province (China) (Figure 1).
For the EU/EEA and the UK as a whole, the number of COVID-19 cases began to rise around 21 February and then increased sharply around 28 February 2020 (additional data).
This was driven by a sharp increase in the number of reported cases from Italy, but all other EU/EEA countries and the UK showed a similar trend of increasing COVID-19 cases (Additional data).
Figure 2 shows the COVID-19 infection rate, in the EU/EEA and UK compared to that in Italy as of 31 January - 15 March 2020.
It shows that, as of 15 March at 8:00 a.m., 15 EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom have already reported cases compared to Italy 3 weeks ago or less.
Our research results show that the number of COVID-19 infections is increasing rapidly in the EU/EEA and the UK.
Observations in the COVID-19 case study suggest that the epidemic is progressing at a rapid pace in all countries.
This is despite the fact that countries are at different stages, in the national public health response, and possibly different demands in countries and different criteria for selecting patients who must be tested for COVID-19, including access to testing.
In early March 2020, doctors in the affected regions of Italy described a situation where ca 10% of patients with COVID-19 needed intensive care and media reported that hospitals and intensive care units in these regions had already reached their maximum capacity.
Data on hospitalization for COVID-19 and/or intensive care unit is currently available at EU/EEA level for only 6% and 1% of cases, respectively (data is not available).
They should, however, be collected in a systematic manner to match current monitoring data that focuses on reporting infection and mortality rates.
A 2010-11 study showed a large variation in the availability of intensive care beds and nursing care beds in Europe, ranging from 29.2 in Germany to 4.2 beds per 100,000 population in Portugal.
This means that countries may have more resources or land than Italy (12.5 intensive care beds per 100,000 population in 2010-11).
Classification criteria based on the fullness of health facilities, and the estimates of each EU/EEA and UK country and occupation of hospital stays for COVID-19 infection met with &gt; > 90% risk and maximum care bed density, are provided in the sixth update of the ECDC Rapid Risk Assessment on COVID-19.
Since the prevalence of the disease is high in some EU/EEA and UK counties, and hospitals and intensive care units often serve the population of the identified area, information on the incidence of the disease and the care beds would be best obtained at the Nomenclature level of the unit of local government for census 2 (NUTS-2) level.
Learning from Italy and current developments in other countries have shown that the COVID-19 pandemic is progressing rapidly in the EU/EEA and the UK.
Countries, hospitals and intensive care units should prepare themselves for the community transmission scenario of SARS-CoV-2 and the increasing number of COVID-19 patients who require healthcare, and specialized care, such as the one occurring in the affected areas of Italy.
As shown in the latest ECDC risk assessment, rapid, efficient and comprehensive planning is critical to slow the spread of SARS-COV-2, with the transition from a robust to a mitigation strategy, as the rapid increase in the number of infections cannot provide adequate time for counselors and even hospitals to understand, adopt and coordinate the process ahead of time.
The early risk assessment also lists public health measures to reduce the impact of epidemics.
There is a short window of opportunity in which countries have the opportunity to increase their control efforts to reduce the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and reduce the health pressure.
Given this, it is likely that the healthcare systems of some EU/EEA countries may face a surge in patients requiring intensive care in the coming days or weeks.
The outbreak of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), which is caused by the acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has so far killed more than 3,000 people and infected more than 80,000 people in China and elsewhere in the world, has become a catastrophe for humanity.
Similar to the same virus, SARS-CoV, which caused SARS in thousands of people in 2003, SARS-CoV-2 can also be transmitted from mosquitoes and causes similar symptoms by a similar mechanism.
However, COVID-19 has a lower morbidity and mortality than SARS but is more transmissible and affects more elderly than young and men than women.
In response to the rapidly increasing number of publications on the emerging pandemic, this article attempts to provide a more thorough analysis of the development of the rapidly evolving research topic.
We will learn the basics of epidemiology, etiology, virology, diagnosis, treatment, prognosis, and prevention of the disease.
Although many questions still need answers, we hope this review will help in understanding and eliminating the threat of the virus.
The Spring Festival on January 25, 2020 became an unforgettable memorial for all Chinese who were asked to stay at home throughout this holiday and for several weeks after the pandemic.
The virus is very similar to the coronavirus (CoV) that caused the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003; therefore, the World Health Organization (WHO) named it SARS-CoV-2 on February 11, 2020, and the related disease was named CoV Disease-19 (COVID-19).
The outbreak began in Wuhan, China, and quickly spread throughout the country and to nearly 50 others worldwide.
As of March 2, 2020, the virus has caused more than 80,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19 infection, with more than 40,000 patients recovering and more than 3,000 patients dying.
"WHO warns that COVID-19 is ""public enemy number 1"" and potentially more powerful than terrorism".
According to PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/), in less than two months, more than 200 papers on COVID-19 including virology, epidemiology, etiology, diagnosis, and treatment have been published since the first report on January 7, 2020 that specified the sequence of the disease isolated from many patients.
This review attempts to summarize the research progress in a new and rapidly developing topic of geography.
Wherever possible, we will try to compare COVID-19 with SARS and the other CoV causing the disease, the Arabian respiratory disease (MERS outbreak, in 2012).
We will also consider what we have learned so far about vaccination and the causes of disease and some remaining questions.
CoVs are traditionally considered non-toxic to humans, mostly causing about 15% of cases of influenza 4.
However, in this century, we have encountered two human-borne outbreaks, namely SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which caused the first outbreaks in China in 2003 and Saudi Arabia in 2012, respectively, and quickly spread to other countries with severe outbreaks and deaths.
Therefore, the current COVID-19 is the third CoV outbreak in human recorded history.
As shown in Figure 1.1, the first case of a non-communicable pneumonia virus originating from Wuhan on December 31, 2019 was reported to the Chinese National Health Service.
Seven days later the CoV sequence was re-tracked.
On January 15, 2020 the first case was reported from Wuhan.
Meanwhile, the disease spread rapidly to neighboring cities, provinces, and countries.
On 20 January, health officials reported, suggesting that human-to-human transmission was possible.
On 23 January, Wuhan was locked down and public transportation was suspended.
On 24 January, the initial clinical investigation of the virus reported that, out of 41 confirmed cases, only 21 people had direct contact with the Wuhan seafood market which is considered the first site of infection from animal origin.
On 30 January, WHO declared a global pandemic emergency.
At the time of writing this report, the virus has already spread in China and in some 50 other countries worldwide (Fig. 2).
As the situation progresses rapidly, the pattern of extinction and its severity remains to be seen.
On February 11, 2020, a center-based study of 8,866 patients including 4,021 confirmed COVID-19 patients presented a new epidemiological data set as follows (https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/UlBi-HX_rHPXa1qHA2bhdA).
SARS affects people of all ages, but it is most common in people aged 30-65.
Nearly half (47.7%) of those infected are over 50 years of age, a few are under 20, and only 14 cases occur in those under 10 years of age.
SARS-CoV-2 is more common in males (0.31 / 100,000) than in females (0.27 / 100,000).
COVID-19 has spread in waves in and around Hubei.
COVID-19 takes a duration of 5 (2-9) days from onset to diagnostic testing.
The average incubation period is 4.8 days (3.0-7.2).
The average time from onset to death was 9.5 days (4.8-13)
The baseline fertility rate (R0) was 3.77 (95% CI: 3.51-4.05), and the correlation R0 was 2.23-4.82.
The number of cases increased significantly before 23 January 2020, which coincided with the transit period before the Spring Festival in China.
The mortality rate of patients with confirmed cases of the disease was 1.44% (95% CI: 1.10-1.86%), and the mortality rate of all patients was 3.06% (95% CI: 2.02-4.59%).
The three main risk factors for COVID-19 are sex (male), age (≥60), and severe pneumonia.
CoVs are a subfamily of large envelope viruses that contain a single RNA subunit.
Three families can be classified, i.e., alpha, beta, gamma, and delta, of which alpha- and beta-CoVs are known to infect humans.
The envelope increases the binding of (S) glycoprotein at the angiotensin-converting enzyme receptor 2 (ACE2) and peptidally peptidase 4 (DPP4) for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, respectively, and membrane synthesis occurs.
Viral RNA is released into the cytoplasm; after cell rearrangement, the RNA genomic coverage and glycofurotin envelope and nucleocapsid proteins form virion-carrying vesicles, which then bind to the plasma membrane for release of the virulent RNA.
The first genome sequence of SARS-CoV-2 was reported on January 10, 2020.
SARS-CoV-2 was identified as a novel beta-CoV variant with more than 99.98% genetic origin among 10 samples collected from the source of the outbreak, Huanan Seafood Market in Wuhan.
SARS-CoV-2 is more similar to SARS-CoV than MERS-CoV.
By electron microscopy, SARS-CoV-2 particles were found in the body's epithelial tissue.
Human ACE2 has been found to be a receptor for SARS-CoV-2 as well as SARS-CoV.
However, the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 is more closely related to human ACE2 than to SARS-CoV, which coincides with the fact that SARS-CoV-2 causes less infection in patients than SARS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 may produce a short-chain protein encoded by orf3b and a protein encoded by orf8.
orf3b of SARS-CoV-2 may play a role in pathogenesis and in inhibiting IFNβ expression; however, orf8 does not have a known functional domain or motif.
On February 18, 2020, Zhou, et al, reported a cryo-EM model of the complete human ACE2 at a 2.9 Å resolution in the amino acid transporter complex B0AT1.
They found that the compound, which was found to be open and closed, was assembled as a dimer and the ACE2-B0AT1 compound could bind the two S protein molecules, which provides evidence for CoV detection and infection.
B0AT1 may be a therapeutic target for drug trials to suppress infection with SARS-CoV-2.
The origin and the center of the disease.
It is known that SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV originated from mice and are transmitted to humans via cats and camels.
By comparing the outcome of SARS-CoV-2 infections with other CoVs, it was concluded that the resident SARS-CoV-2 twin was the new virus as it was 96% to two SARS-like CoVs from the bats called bat-SL-CoVZX45 and twin-SL-CoVZX21.
However, the exact mechanism that helps the virus break the species barrier to infect humans is still unknown, and the mechanism of transmission is not yet well understood.
Ji, et al., have proposed snakes as a transmission of the virus from mice to humans that is associated with interaction between S protein.
According to one study, researchers in Guangzhou, China, suggested that pangolins - long-nosed, mouth-to-mouth, predatory animals used extensively in traditional Chinese medicine - are the SARS-COV-2 antagonists that are likely to be based on 99% mutations in a CoV detected in pangolins and SARS-CoV-2.
However, the 1% difference spread over the two molecules is still a large difference; therefore, final results are awaited for definitive evidence (Fig.
The chemical properties of SARS-CoV-2 are still unknown.
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV can survive in a test bottle for 48 hours in a bushy environment for up to 5 days at below 20 °C and a humidity of 40% -50%.
SARS-CoV-2 may possess similar properties.
SARS-CoV-2 is reported to be able to maintain a thermal and radiation-free atmosphere at 56 °C for 30 minutes; 75% ethanol, chlorine-containing chemicals, peracetic acid, chloroform, and other fat-reducing agents, but not chlorhexidine, can effectively destroy the virus.
The population as a whole has lost immunity to SARS-CoV-2 and therefore is vulnerable to new infections.
Currently, no complete studies have been reported on the immune response to SARS-CoV-2.
Thus, we can only refer to previous studies on other CoVs, especially SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Fig. (Fig. 4).4).
Generally, after the virus has invaded the host, it is first recognized by immune-mediated receptors (PRRs) including C-type receptors, like-Toll receptor (TLR), like-NOD receptor (NLR), and like-RIG-I receptor (RLR).
Through various mechanisms, the virus causes the expression of inflammatory factors, dendritic cell accumulation, and the activation of type I interferons (IFNs) that limit the spread of the virus and increase the viral levels of the virus.
However, the N-protein kinase of SARS-CoV may help the virus escape the immune response.
Soon, the vaccine response was engaged in a war against viruses.
T lymphocytes including CD4+ and CD8+ T cells play an important role in immunity.
CD4+T cells stimulate B cells to produce specific antibodies, and CD8+T cells directly kill infected virus cells.
The helper T cell produces inflammatory cytokines to help protect the cells.
However, CoVs can inhibit T cell functions by inducing T cell apoptosis.
Neuronal immunity including connections such as C3a and C5a and immune cells are essential for fighting infection.
For example, isolation of immune cells from a recovering patient disrupts MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, an overload of the immune system results in a large amount of free radiation in the environment that can cause damage to the lungs and other organs, and, in extreme cases, the failure of several viruses and even death.
SARS-CoV-2 infection, which is characterized by contagion, is more likely to infect elderly residents with other infections and pregnant women.
It is common for people who have multiple infections or who are isolated from work to be more likely to be infected than others.
The estimated incubation period of SARS-CoV-2 is 1-14 days, with a maximum of 3-7 days based on the initial analysis of 425 cases in Wuhan.
However, the study of 1,099 infected individuals showed that the gestation period was 3 days on average and from 0 to 24 days.
A more recent study showed that the incubation period was 4.8 days (3.0-7.2 days) based on a history of 8,866 cases.
It is very important for health authorities to adjust the quarantine period according to the shelf life, thus preventing infection but people who are not infected by the virus can spread the virus to others.
As is the custom today, people in public, or infected, are usually required to quarantine for 14 days.
Should the period of dedication be extended to 24 days?
Fever is the main and early symptom of COVID-19, which can be associated with no symptoms or other symptoms such as dry cough, shortness of breath, nervous pain, hypertension, headache, sore throat, rhinorrhea, chest pain, diarrhea, heartburn, and dizziness.
Some patients have experienced dyspnea and/or hypoxemia a week after the onset of the disease.
In severe cases, patients were prone to develop severe respiratory disease, spasm, metabolic acidosis, and coagulopathy.
Patients with fever and/or respiratory symptoms and a high fever, even without symptoms of pneumonia, should be screened for the virus to detect it early.
A demographic survey at the end of December 2019 showed that the prevalence of symptoms was 98% for fever, 76% for dry cough, 55% for dyspnea, and 3% for diarrhea; 8% of patients require ventilation support.
Similar cases have been reported in two recent studies of family cough and cough caused by transmission from a person with symptoms of the disease.
In comparison, a 2012 human study showed that MERS-CoV patients also had a fever rate (98%), a dry cough rate (47%), and dyspnea rate (55%) as their main symptoms.
However, 80% of them require ventilation support, more than COVID-19 patients and are more likely to have a higher incidence of MERS than COVID-19.
Diarrhoea (26%) and sore throat (21%) were also observed with MERS patients.
In SARS patients, it has been shown that fever in the bone (99% -100%), dry cough in the bone (29% -75%), dyspnea in the bone (40% -42%), diarrhea in the bone (20-25%), and sore throat (13 -25%) are the main symptoms and ventilation support is required for approximately 14% -20% of patients.
As of 14 February, COVID-19 mortality was 2% when the confirmed cases of the flu reached 66,576 worldwide.
In comparison, deaths from SARS from November 2002 were 10% of the 8,096 confirmed cases.
For MERS, based on a June 2012 demographic survey, the mortality rate was 37% of the 2,494 confirmed cases.
A previous study reported that the R0 of SARS-CoV-2 was above 6.47 with a 95% confidence interval (CI) of 5.71-7.23, while the R0 of SARS-CoV was only listed from 2 to 4.
Comparisons of SARS-CoV-2 with MERS-CoV and SARA-CoV in terms of their symptoms, mortality, and R0 are presented in Table Table1.1.
The above suggests that SARS-CoV-2 has a higher potential for transmission than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, but is less potent than the latter two.
Therefore, it is more challenging to control the SARS-CoV-2 virus than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV.
A single sinking is usually a repeat of a single family or a single gathering or a vehicle such as a boat.
Patients typically have a history of travel or residence in Wuhan or other affected areas or contact with infected individuals or patients in the last two weeks before the onset of the disease.
However, it has been reported that people can carry the virus without symptoms for more than two weeks and then recovering patients admitted from hospitals can carry the virus again, which sends an alarm to extend the quarantine period.
Patients have an equal or reduced number of lymphocytes (especially lymphocytes) in the early stages.
For example, lymphopenia with a white blood cell count <4 × 109/L was associated with a lymphocyte count <1×109/L, and levels of asotate aminotransferase and viremia were elevated in 1,099 patients infected with COVID-19.
Liver-vascular enzyme and myoglobin levels increased in the blood of some patients, and C-reactive protein and erythrocyte clearance increased in the blood of most patients.
In patients with severe disease, the level of D-dimer, a type of destructive fibrin present in the blood, is elevated, and the number of lymphocytes is reduced.
Defects in chest X-rays are found in most COVID-19 patients and are indicated by a double shadow of the shadow or a low glass in the lungs.
Many patients develop pneumonia, acute pulmonary injury, and acute respiratory syndrome (ARDS).
When ARDS occurs, uncontrolled inflammation, fluid accumulation, and chronic fibrosis severely damage the gas exchange.
The imbalance of type-I and type-II pneumocytes reduces the level of surfactant and increases tension, thereby reducing the ability of the lungs to expand and increasing the risk of lung failure.
Thus, the worst-case heart scan often corresponds to the most severe case.
On February 18, 2020, the first COVID-19 diagnosis showed inadequate pneumocytes, hyaline membrane, and cervical cancer, and multiple viral cell lines in the lungs of infected patients who died of the disease, consistent with the prevalence of ARDS-like infections in patients with SARS and MERS.
SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection by reverse-transcriptase (RT-PCR) has been used as the main criteria for testing for COVID-19.
However, due to the high risk of no-loss, which could accelerate epidemics, clinical signs for diagnosis (which do not rely on RT-PCR) were first used alone in China on February 13, 2020.
A similar situation occurred with the emergence of SARS.
Therefore, the combination of disease history, clinical presentation, laboratory testing and radiological examination is important and necessary for a proper diagnosis.
On February 14, 2020, Feng Zhang's team reported a method using CRISPR's SHERLOCK technology for detecting SARS-CoV-2, which detects synthetic SARS-CoV-2 RNA molecules at 20 × 10-18 mol/L to 200 × 10-18 mol/L (10-100 copies per microliter of input) using a dipstick in less than an hour without the need for instrumental analysis.
Hopefully, the new technique can improve mental health and well-being if it is proven in clinical models.
Due to limited expertise with the new CoV variant, doctors may be able to provide specialized care for COVID-19 patients, while several therapies that have been used or introduced to treat other CoVs such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV and other infections are being tested (Table 2).
These current and potential therapies include antibiotics, immunosuppressants, steroids, plasma from recovered patients, Chinese medicine, and psychosocial support.
Even plasma from recovered patients has been presented for use in medical treatment.
Pharmaceutical companies are racing to develop antibodies and vaccines against the virus.
SARS-CoV-2 primarily attacks the lungs in the early stages and may also attack, to a lesser extent, other organs that express ACE2, such as the gastrointestinal system and the kidneys.
However, respiratory damage and failure are the greatest risk to patients and the leading cause of death.
Therefore, respiratory support is essential to alleviate symptoms and save lives and includes all ventilation treatment, rapid ventilation, ventilation from a ventilator, depending on the severity of the disease.
Patients with symptoms of acute respiratory syndrome must be supported with extracoronary oxygen therapy (ECMO), an effective cardiac pacemaker technique used for the treatment of acute heart attacks or respiratory failure.
In addition, electrolyte balance regulation, prevention and monitoring of infection and release, and immunity from organ function are also very important for SARS-CoV-2 patients.
It is known that cytokine storm is caused by an overload of the immune system in SARS and MERS patients.
Cytokine storm is a type of natural response of the inflammatory system that is induced by a series of cytokines including TNFα, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6, IFNα, IFNβ, IFNγ, and MCP-1.
These cytokines together with the immune cell release a large amount of unchanged neurotransmitters that are the main cause of ARDS and multiple organ failure.
Immunosuppression is essential to monitor cytokine storm, especially in severely injured patients.
Corticosteroids and tocilizumab, an anti-IL6 monoclonal antibody, have been used to treat cytokine storm.
Other immunosuppressant treatments for cytokine storm include direct T cell immunosuppressant modulation and response; IFN-γ, IL-1, and TNF inhibition; JAK inhibition; blinatumomab; cytokine marker 4 inhibitor; and HDAC inhibitors.
Steroids, such as immunosuppressants, have been widely used in the treatment of SARS to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage.
However, high doses of steroids are not beneficial for severe lung injury in patients with SARS and COVID-19.
Instead, they can cause serious side effects, especially osteonecrosis, which causes the disease's effects.
However, short courses of corticosteroids at low-to-medium doses are recommended to be used with caution for COVID-19 patients.
At the time of writing, there is no proven vaccine.
However, intravenous administration with remdesivir, a nucleotide analog, is finding effectiveness in US COVID-19 patients.
Remdesivir is a novel antibiotic that was originally developed by Gideon for the treatment of infections caused by Ebola and Marlburg viruses.
Later, the secretary also suggested the possibility of blocking other single RNA viruses including the MERS and SARS viruses.
In connection with these, Gideon has given the link to China to conduct two trials on people infected with SARS-CoV-2, and results are expected to be very positive.
In addition, baricitinb, interferon-α, lopinavir/ritonavir, and ribavirin are recommended as sedatives for patients who have severe respiratory illness.
Nausea, diarrhea, vomiting, liver damage, and other painful reactions may occur after combination therapy with lofinavir/ritonavir.
The interactions of these treatments with other medications used in patients should be carefully monitored.
Plasma from patients who have recovered from immunity.
The collection of blood from patients recovering from an infectious disease to be given to other infected patients or to protect the health of others from infection has a long history.
Indeed, recovered patients usually have a high level of immunity to the virus in their blood.
The body's immune system is made up of anti-immune globulin (Ig) produced by B lymphocytes to fight off viruses and other foreign substances and is aware of specific antibodies in infections in them.
In this regard, plasma was taken from the blood of a group of patients who had recovered from COVID-19 and was injected into 10 critically ill patients.
Their symptoms improved within 24 hours, with reduced inflammation and lowered blood pressure and improved oxygen saturation.
However, verification and information are necessary to present the method for wide use before specific therapies are developed.
In addition, given the curative effect, other plasma-related weaknesses will be considered carefully.
For example, immune infections can overwhelm the immune system and cause the release of a signaling agent called alcytokine, which can be life-threatening.
The blood-immune system is usually low, and the need for plasma is high to treat patients with severe illnesses.
It is difficult to develop and produce specific vaccines quickly to fight global pandemics.
Therefore, it is more important and desirable to isolate B cells from recovering patients and identify gene codes associated with improved immune function or to check for specifically targeted proteins of the virus.
In this way, we can increase the production of immune cells.
TCM has been used to treat a number of other ailments in China for thousands of years.
However, its effectiveness depends on the combination of several ingredients in a process that varies depending on the diagnosis of the disease considered in the TCM hypothesis.
Many of the active ingredients are unknown or misunderstood because it is difficult to isolate and verify such ingredients or their constituents.
Currently, due to the inefficiency and specificity of COVID-19 treatment, TCM has become one of the preferred methods of treating patients with light to moderate symptoms or for those recovering from severe episodes.
For example, the Shu Feng Jie Du and Lian Hua Qing Wen vaccines have been found to be suitable for the treatment of COVID-19.
The highest cure rate of COVID-19 patients in several Chinese provinces that use TCM is at 87% of their patients, including Gansu (63.7%), Ningxia (50%), and Hunan (50%), while Hubei Province, which uses TCM at about 30% of COVID-19 patients, has the lowest cure rate (13%).
However, this is a poor estimate as other influential factors such as the number and severity of patients should be included in the evaluation.
On February 18, 2020, Boli Zhang and her colleagues published a study comparing Western medicine (WM) therapy alone with a combination of WM therapy and TCM.
They found that the times required for recovery of physical conditions, symptomatic disorders, and hospitalization were much lower in the WM+ TCM group than in the WM group alone.
Most interestingly, the injury-causing disease (from mild to severe) was lower in the WM+ TCM group than in the WM group only percentage (7.4% versus 46.2%) and the mortality rate was lower in the WM+ TCM group than in the WM only group percentage (8.8% versus 39%).
However, the efficacy and safety of TCM still await further well-controlled trials on a larger scale and in more institutions.
It will also be interesting to know the nature of the practices and to describe the best TCM treatments or their combination if possible.
Patients suspected or confirmed with COVID-19 often face extreme fears about the infectious disease and even death, and people who isolate themselves also experience depression, loneliness, and anger.
In addition, symptoms of infection such as fever, shortness of breath, and cough as well as various medical side effects such as insomnia induced by corticosteroids can lead to increased anxiety and depression.
At the start of the SARS outbreak, there was a range of psychiatric disorders including chronic anxiety, anxiety, panic, anxiety, psychosis symptoms, aggression, and even suicide.
Low contact and isolation of patients, as part of the public health response to the spread of COVID-19, can make people more anxious and guilty about the consequences of the spread, isolation, and rejection of family and friends.
Therefore, mental health care should be provided to COVID-19 patients, suspected victims, people in contact with them and other community members who are in need.
Mental support should include the establishment of multi-minded health groups, open communication with regular updates on SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks and management plans and the use of electronic devices and applications to avoid close contact.
Antibiotics are essential to stop the spread of infection from animal bodies and humans to infectious agents more easily and often contribute to the anti-bacterial therapy to combat the infection caused by developing viruses.
Efforts have been made to develop S protein-based vaccines to provide long-term immunity and break down the body's immune system and/or immunity from SARS-CoV infection.
Live vaccines have been evaluated in animal samples of SARS.
However, the efficacy of these vaccines in older adults and low-dose models and their protection against zoonotic viral infection have not yet been determined prior to the start of clinical studies.
This is probably because SARS has been dead for 17 years and no new infections have been reported.
In contrast, outbreaks and outbreaks of MERS continue to occur in the Middle East and have spread to other regions as a result of persistent zoonotic pathways in infected areas.
A vaccine strategy for MERS has been developed using sterile virus, DNA plasmids, viral microorganisms, nanoparticles, virus-like particles and microorganisms that have also been evaluated in animal models.
Developing effective vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 for unimmunized populations is an urgent and critical step to combat the ongoing pandemic.
However, it is challenging to overcome the difficulties due to the long time (at least 18 months) required to develop a vaccine and the variation of CoVs.
As a new disease, COVID-19 has begun to emerge fully as a clinical outbreak with thousands of new infections.
In most cases, patients can recover slowly without sequelae.
However, similar to SARS and MERS, COVID-19 is also associated with high mortality in patients with severe cases of the disease.
Therefore, the development of a disease prediction system is essential for health authorities to prioritize its services, especially in areas where resources are hard to come by.
Based on clinical studies reported so far, the following factors may affect or be associated with the progression of COVID-19 patients (Table (Table33)):
Age: Age is the most important predictor of SARS, which is true for COVID-19.
COVID-19 occurs most commonly in the 30-65 age group with 47.7% of these patients being over 50 in the 8,866 case studies as described above.
Patients who require intensive care are more likely to have some concurrent and complicated symptoms and are older than those who do not (in the median age of 66 and 51), recommending age as a predictor for outcomes for COVID-19 patients.
Gender: SARS-CoV-2 is more common in males than females (0.31 / 100,000 versus 0.27 / 100,000), as described above.
Disorders and distress: Patients with COVID-19 who require intensive care are more likely to suffer from severe heart failure and arrhythmia.
The occurrence of heart attack is also a leading cause of death in SARS patients.
It has been reported that SARS-CoV-2 may bind to ACL2-positive cholangiocytes, which may cause liver dysfunction in COVID-19 patients.
It is important to note that age and disease are closely related and can interfere with each other.
Non-road laboratory test: C-reactive protein (CRP) level in blood indicates severe inflammation or tissue injury and has been proposed to be a potential risk factor for disease progression, response to treatment, and ultimate recovery.
The correlation of CRP levels to the severity and prognosis of COVID-19 outbreak was also noted.
In addition, elevating lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and creatine kinase (CK) may help predict the outcome.
These enzymes are expressed in many organs, especially in the heart and liver, and are released during the digestion of tissue.
Thus, they can detect whether the heart is functioning properly or not.
Major clinical signs: Cardiac imaging and developmental clinical signs should be monitored along with other indications to predict the effects and complications of COVID-19.
Steroid use: As described above, steroids are immunosuppressants commonly used as an adjunct to allergy treatment to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage.
Since a large number of corticosteroids have been widely used in SARS patients, many of the survivors have suffered from osteonecrosis episodes with life-limiting disabilities and reduced survival.
Therefore, if necessary, steroids should be used for low doses and for short duration in COVID-19 patients.
Depression: As described above, during the COVID-19 pandemic many patients suffer from severe depression as they endure long periods of isolation and extreme uncertainty and witness the death of family members and friends of the patient.
It is important to provide long-term counseling and support to help such patients recover from stress and return to a normal life.
According to demographic studies so far, the COVID-19 syndrome has a distinctly different epidemiological characteristics from SARS.
In addition to replication in the lower respiratory tract, SARS-CoV-2 can also divide heavily in the upper respiratory tract and cause little or no early signs of infection, similar to other CoVs that cause the common cold.
Therefore, patients infected in the early stages or during the preparation period may produce a large amount of viral activity during daily activities, causing great difficulty in dealing with the infection.
However, SARS-CoV transmission is considered to occur when patients are ill, while most transmission does not occur in the early stages.
Thus, the current COVID-19 outbreak is more severe and difficult to control than the SARS outbreak.
Currently, extensive efforts are underway in China including the lockdown of Wuhan and surrounding cities and continued public quarantine in the hope of halting the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
Although these activities have devastated the economy of the country and other parts of the country, the number of new cases is declining, indicating a decline in the epidemic.
The best expectation is that the outbreak will end in March and the subsidence period will last 3-4 months.
Still, some experts are hopeless.
Paul Hunter, et al., estimated that COVID-19, which appears to be more infectious than SARS, will not end in 2020.
Ira Longini, et al., developed a model to predict the outcome of the pandemic and suggested SARS-CoV-2 may infect two-thirds of the world's population.
A team from Canada reported that SARS-CoV-2 was detected in the turbinate duct and throat of patients who recovered and were discharged from hospital 2 weeks ago, suggesting that the newly identified virus may be something similar to the flu-like virus.
However, signs of signs have occurred in China in terms of the decline in new cases of the disease, indicating a strategy that may now be effective.
A virus called Ebola has been predicted to cause one million cases and half a million deaths.
However, through isolation and isolation, the disease eventually died out.
Likely, similar to SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 may become vulnerable to infection and eventually die or become less virulent with humans.
The comparison of COVID-19 epidemics with those of SARS and MERS is given as given below (Fig. (Fig. 55).
SARS-CoV-2 is mainly spread by coughing or sneezing, and possibly also by direct contact with contaminated materials.
The virus has also been detected in bone, which raises a new possibility of the disease spreading from bone to mouth.
A recent study of 138 cases reported that 41% of these cases were possible through nosocomial infection, including 17 patients with back infections and 40 healthcare workers.
Therefore, strict precautions should be taken to protect individuals, especially healthcare workers, social workers, family members, coworkers, and even those in contact with patients or infected people.
The first line of protection that can be used to reduce the risk of infection is by wearing face masks; both the use of surgical masks and the N95 respirator type mask (series # 1860s) help to control the spread of infectious virus.
A surgical mask prevents the possible fluid from infected people from traveling through the air or sticking to surfaces, where it can be transmitted to others.
However, N95 (series # 1860s) masks can protect against the inhalation of virions as small as 10 to 80 nm, with only 5% of the virions able to penetrate the entire surface; SARS-CoV-2 is similar to SARS-CoV in size and overall about 85 m long.
Since particles can penetrate even five separate surgical masks, healthcare workers in direct contact with patients must wear N95 (series # 1860s) masks but not surgical masks.
In addition to masks, healthcare workers should wear isolation suits to further reduce exposure to the virus.
Bacteria can also be transmitted through the eyes.
On January 22, 2020, the doctor was diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 despite wearing an N95 mask; the virus may have entered his body through his eyelids.
Therefore, healthcare workers also wear a face shield or mask when working with patients.
For the general public in the affected areas, it is recommended that everyone wash their hands with soap to prevent the spread of the virus more frequently, try to stay indoors for self-isolation and limit contact with potential infected people.
Six feet was considered the appropriate distance for people to sit to avoid sick people.
These actions are effective ways to reduce the risk of infection and prevent the spread of the virus
Although SARS-CoV-2 is a new virus to the human world, its high risk to SARS-CoV as reported on 7 January 2020 should raise serious alarm for China in light of its deep reflection on the SARS outbreak in 2003.
However, as of 19 January 2020, the director of the Wuhan Center for Disease Control has reassured the citizens by saying that the new novel virus has low transmission and low human-to-human transmission and is not a problem for prevention and control of the disease.
This message has eased public sentiment, especially as the entire country is preparing for the Spring Festival, and it has taken a long time to get the virus to its lowest level in Wuhan.
The disease control authorities in China may take this lesson and make important progress in the future.
For example, these agencies should be (1) more careful when making public announcements as every word is a threat to citizens and can change behavior and decision-making; (2) more sensitive to and focused on unknown information from hospitals rather than waiting for full information from doctors or officials; (3) more proactive to handle the pandemic in its early stages rather than trying to console the public; and (4) more proactive to provide more accurate and timely information to increase public awareness of pandemics and to test and improve community response strategies in some cases.
The COVID-19 outbreak caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus started in late December 2019.
In less than two months, it had spread throughout China and to nearly 50 other countries around the world by the time this was written.
Since the virus is similar to SARS-CoV and the symptoms are also similar between COVID-19 and SARS, the COVID-19 outbreak has created a sense of resurgence of SARS.
However, there are some striking differences between COVID-19 and SARS, which are crucial for stopping the epidemic and managing patients.
COVID-19 affects older adults more than young people and men more than women, and mortality rates and mortality rates are higher among older adults than among young people.
SARS has a higher mortality rate than COVID-19 (10.91% versus 1.44%).
COVID-19 patients transmit the virus even if they have no symptoms whereas SARS patients do so usually when they are severely ill, which makes it more difficult to carry the spread of COVID-19 than SARS.
This section explains why the spread of SARS-CoV-2 is faster and more widespread than SARS-CoV.
The normal RNA-proving for SARS-CoV-2 may be negative in some COVID-19 patients.
On the other hand, cured patients may be certain of recurrence.
These findings increased the risk of spreading the virus.
Given such rapid progress in COVID-19 research, critical issues can be addressed, as follows:
Where did SARS-CoV-2 come from?
Although 96% of the bacteria were found to be related to SARS-CoV-2 and two SARS-like CoVs, we still cannot conclude that SARS-CoV-2 is from the bats.
Which animal species are central to the transmission of the virus from the original vector, the tick, to humans?
Without knowing answers #1 and #2, we cannot effectively cut off transmission, and the outbreak may reoccur at any time.
Although molecular modeling and genetic testing have shown that SARS-CoV-2 binds to ACE2, how does the virus enter the cell membrane and cause mutations?
Does the virus also carry the ACE2 expression molecule to other organs?
Without answers to these questions, we would not have reliable research and medical treatment.
How long will the plague last?
How does the virus change the environment when it spreads between humans?
Could it be a global pandemic, dying like SARS or recurring like the flu?
It is important but may take time to search for answers to the above questions and many other questions.
However, with whatever money he needed, we had no choice but to stop the plague early and return to our normal life.
Zoonotic origin of human coronaviruses
It is the interbreeding and adaptation that has caused the evolution of coronaviruses (CoVs) and their habitat, including humans, for thousands of years.
Before 2003, two human-to-human CoVs (HCoVs) were known to cause mild illness, such as the common cold.
The outbreak of the highly contagious acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and the Middle East influenza virus (MERS) has turned the tables on how the HCoV outbreak could have been.
The SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in central China in late 2019 has pushed the spread of CoVs further and surprised us that it is easily transmitted but the viral load is low compared to its sister SARS-CoV.
HCoVs are transmitted from animals and understanding the origin of HcoVs helps to tell.
Most HCoVs are derived from mosquitoes where they are non-pathogenic.
Transmitters of other HCoVs are also known to exist.
Identifying the exact animal that is infected will directly help to protect people from the disease.
Testing of animal-to-animal interactions with the infected CoV may help to detect the spread of the CoV genome in humans.
In this review, we present an overview of the existing knowledge about the seven HCoVs, with a focus on the history of their discovery and how the zoonotic origin and spread of the species occurred.
The key here is to differentiate between HCoVs from understanding how the virus originally replicated and the genes replicated from their source.
The 2019 coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic is described here.
Furthermore, the need for a virus to successfully host a mutant was emphasized and the implications of how the virus' evolutionary processes accelerate the disease were emphasized.
Coronaviruses (CoVs) are a family of Coronaviridae, which includes a distinct group of single-stranded RNA viruses.
These viruses consist of a large array of RNA sequences ranging from 26 to 32, which is why they are called CoVs and can be seen under a microscope.
In general, CoVs have a non-differentiated gene that has a similar structure.
About two-thirds of the genome contains two large open florets (ORF1a and ORF1b), which are translated into pp1a and pp1ab copies of polyproteins.
Polyproteins are further processed to form 16 non-sporeforming proteins, encoded nsp1~16.
The other part of the base of the gene contains ORFs for proteins such as, spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M) and nucleoprotein (N).
Most of the genetic variants, too, are coated with different strains of CoVs.
Based on differences in the sequence of proteins, CoVs are classified into four subtypes (alpha-CoV, beta-CoV, gamma-CoV and delta-CoV), among which beta-CoVs comprise the majority of HCoVs and are further subdivided into four subtypes (A, B, C and D).
Animal biology evidence suggests that mice and mammals serve as the primary source of most alpha-CoVs and beta-CoVs, while birds are the major reservoir of gamma-CoVs and delta-CoVs
For thousands of years now, CoVs have overcome the species barrier and some have emerged as important human viruses.
To date, seven different strains of human-borne HCoVs have been identified.
Among them HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63 are alpha-CoVs.
The other five beta-CoVs include HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), the common cold coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and SARS-CoV-2.
HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63 infections are usually associated with mild symptoms such as flu and orthostasis.
In contrast, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and the recently identified SARS-CoV-2 are the most common infectious diseases causing severe neurological damage in patients with a high potential for developing acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and manifesting symptoms.
The first HCoV-229E strain, B814, was isolated from the nasal secretions of patients with frequent influenza in the mid-1960s.
Since then, knowledge on HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 has been gaining ground, through the deepening of the epidemiological analysis.
Of course, the idea that infection with HCoVs was generally harmless was widely accepted until the SARS outbreak.
The 2003 SARS outbreak was one of the worst in recent history, infecting more than 8,000 people with a critical mortality rate of nearly 10%.
A decade later, the outbreak of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) created a daily epidemic in the Arab World with its spread to other parts of the world.
The 2019 novel HCoV (2019-nCoV), later renamed SARS-CoV-2, is a representative of the progressive mutation of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which has caused more than 3,120 deaths and infected more than 91,000 people as of March 3, 2020.
The alarm is ringing and the world must prepare for the coming SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.
All seven HCoVs are of animal origin such as mice, rats or domestic animals.
More evidence supports the evolutionary origin of all HCoVs from mice, where the viruses are well adapted and not pathogenic but show high genetic diversity.
The COVID-19 pandemic has presented a major medical, scientific, social and moral challenge to China and the world.
The analysis of the animal origin of the HCoVs provides a framework for understanding the genetic history, driving forces and barriers to the cross-pollination of the species.
This may lead to or facilitate the detection of pool, medium and enhanced host population (s) of SARS-CoV-2, with significant implications in the prevention of future recurrence.
In this workshop, we present a brief overview of the zoonotic origin, their transmission between the species themselves and the architecture of HCoVs.
In particular, we are shedding more light and information on the genetic origin of HCoVs and not that they originate from non-pathogenic organisms after entering the body of a different person.
We also reviewed the evolutionary pattern of HCoVs in which an increase in transmission often accompanies a decrease in the virus donor.
The outcome of the outbreak is also described here.
Animal CoVs have been known since the late 1930s.
Before the first isolation of the B814 strain of HCoV-229E from the nasal passages of a person infected with the common cold, CoVs were isolated in various infected animals such as turkeys, mice, cattle, pigs, cats and dogs.
In the last two decades, the cuatr family of HCoVs was identified.
A brief history of HCoV detection in the first series of these tables (Table 1) will be satisfactory and provide detailed information on it.
The HCoV-229E strain was first isolated from patients with respiratory tract infection and upper respiratory tract infection in 1966, later gaining growth recognition in the pulmonary cell line WI-38.
Patients infected with HCoV-229E presented with common cold symptoms, including headache, dizziness, nausea, fever and sore throat, and fever and cough seen in 10~20% of patients.
Later in 1967, HCoV-OC43 was isolated from the organ culture and the subsequent serial passage in mouse brains.
The clinical features of HCoV-OC43 infection are similar to those caused by HCoV-229E, which are characterized by differentiation from infection by other viral infections such as influenza viruses and rhinoviruses.
Both HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 are globally widespread, and are mostly transmitted in the summer, in temperate or cold climates.
The average incubation period for both infections is less than a week, followed by about two weeks of illness.
According to human volunteer studies, healthy people who are infected with HCoV-229E have a common cold.
A small number of patients with weak immune systems show severe infection of the target pathway.
"SARS, also known as the "pneumonic virus"", was the first documented HCoV-causing virus in human history and the etiological agent was SARS-CoV, the third HCoV to be identified".
The first SARS infection was detected in late 2002 in China's Guangdong Province.
The SARS outbreak has caused 8,096 reported cases and 774 deaths, spread across several countries and continents.
Except for the main heroes, it is estimated that each strain can give approximately two strains of mycobacterium, with a preparation period of 4 to 7 days and a viral pathogen manifesting on day 10 of illness.
Patients who are infected with SARS-CoV are initially accompanied by myalgia, headaches, fever, malaria and severe colds, followed by dyspnea, cough and severe anxiety as symptoms.
Lymphopenia, liver function tests, and elevated creatine kinase are common factors in the testing of SARS.
Diffuse alveolar damage (lung damage), epithelial cell proliferation (expansion of the body's own genes), and increased macrophages (blood cells) have been detected in SARS patients.
At least 20-30% of patients later require intensive care and ventilation.
Beyond the lower respiratory tract, many internal organs, including the intestines, liver and kidneys can become infected in these severe cases, usually with cytokine exposure, which can be especially lethal for immunocompromised patients.
The virus was first isolated from a collection of lung cells from an Ebola-infected relative who had travelled to Hong Kong from Guangzhou.
Since then, studies have been conducted on the HCoV.
HCoV-NL63 was isolated from a 7-month-old baby from the Netherlands in late 2004.
It is found primarily in young children, the elderly and immunocompromised patients with respiratory diseases.
The presence of coryza, conjunctivitis, fever, and diarrhea is common in infections caused by HCoV-NL63.
An independent study revealed the isolation of a single virus from a nasal sample from an 8-month-old boy with pneumonia in the Netherlands.
Although it was discovered in the Netherlands, it has certainly spread around the world.
It is estimated that the HCoV-NL63 gene is responsible for at least 4.7 percent of respiratory infections, and is seen at the same time as spring, autumn and winter onset.
HCoV-NL63 is related to the blockade-causing bacterial infection, also known as croup.
A year ago, HCoV-HKU1 was first identified in a 71-year-old man who was rushed to hospital with pneumonia and pneumonia in Hong Kong.
In addition to community-acquired pneumonia and pulmonary artery disease, HCoV-HKU1 has been reported to be associated with severe asthma.
Similar to HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 has been found worldwide, causing a small targeted infection.
All four HCoVs and communities have found a home in humans and are often unable to mutate to cause pathogenicity, although accidents have occurred for unknown reasons as in the most common case of HCoV-NL63, which was recently reported to cause severe respiratory illness in China.
In general, when these HCoVs are able to spread effectively and maintain themselves completely in humans, they also become less destructive or harmful.
MERS-CoV was first isolated in 2012 in the lungs of a 60-year-old patient with acute pulmonary syndrome and renal failure in Saudi Arabia.
Given that most of the confirmed strains originated in the Middle East, a second outbreak was reported to close contacts in various European countries and Tunisia.
A secondary outbreak occurred in South Korea in 2015 with 186 confirmed cases of the virus.
The clinical manifestations of MERS are similar to those of SARS, which is characterized by severe pneumonia.
However unlike SARS, many MERS patients also experience kidney failure, which is a major reason for differentiating the MERS virus from the HCoV-derived pathogen.
More than 30% of patients have gastrointestinal symptoms, such as nausea and vomiting.
As of February 14, 2020, over 2500 laboratory-confirmed infections were associated with a 34.4% mortality rate, making MERS-CoV one of the most destructive human diseases ever recorded.
Just in mid-December 2019, a number of patients with respiratory distress or pneumonia that was thought to be similar to SARS-CoV-2 were diagnosed in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
The World Health Organization has declared the pandemic as a targeted outbreak caused by SARS-CoV-2 which has become a major challenge to International Public Health and has designated the pandemic COVID-19.
As of March 3, 2020, there were 90,053 confirmed cases worldwide, with a death rate due to infection of 3.4%.
In particular, the death rate from the disease in Hubei, China was 4.2 percent, while the figure abroad was 1.2 percent.
SARS-CoV-2 causes severe respiratory illnesses such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, presented as fever, cough and dyspnea.
Diarrhea is also seen in some patients.
Pneumonia is one of the symptoms of disease and can progress rapidly to severe respiratory distress.
Although SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are very similar due to the 82% killing nucleotide characteristics, they heal in different branches in the gene tree.
Compared to SARS-CoV which has a high rate of mutation, the rate of SARS-CoV-2 mutation is much lower, indicating a high degree of acceptance in humans.
A newly reported SARS-CoV-2 infection marker may have contributed to the rapid spread globally.
Comparison and interchange of SARS-CoV-2 with six other HCoVs reveal significant similarities and differences.
First, the timing of the outbreak and the manner in which the HCoV is transmitted are similar.
In this regard, SARS-CoV-2 follows the general trend of the other six HCoVs.
The second is that the severity of COVID-19 symptoms is dependent between the SARS-CoV virus and its four other variants: HCoVs (i.e. HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63).
On the one hand, SARS-CoV-2 infection presents features that are most commonly seen during HCoV infection, and that the community experiences, including the introduction of non-specific, mild or even no symptoms.
On the other hand, a small bone marrow can be seen in severe COVID-19 infection as seen in SARS-CoV infection, however the bone marrow is smaller.
Third, the spread of SARS-CoV-2 also shows interesting characteristics of HCoVs and community exposure compared to SARS-CoV.
On the one hand, the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 is similar to that of community-acquired HCoVs.
On the other hand, it remains to be established whether the potential for SARS-CoV-2 infection has decreased after localization data in humans as in the case of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Finally, similar to other HCoVs, SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in fecal samples.
The study of whether SARS-CoV-2 transmission via oral route played a role in the transmission of SARS-CoV remains to be confirmed in future studies.
It is also of great interest to see whether SARS-CoV-2 can be expressed in the same manner as community events have been detected by HCoVs.
However, the features of SARS-CoV-2 including transmission, pathogenicity and post-transmission progression in humans will be influential on the eventual outbreak of COVID-19.
All four communities have found HCoVs that cause related symptoms to be homologous to humans.
In other words, it may be true that humans have adapted to these four HCoVs.
Alternatively, both could be from living ancestors of HCoVs.
HCoVs that cause serious infections in humans and in people who are infected with serious HCoV infections are eliminated.
For this to happen, HCoVs need to replicate in humans to a sufficient degree to allow for the accumulation of mutations that would overcome the reasons for the shelter restrictions.
In this way, the longer the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak continues and more people are infected with it, the greater the chance that it will fully adapt to humans.
If it becomes established, its spread from person to person will be very difficult through quarantine or other randomized control measures.
For decades, four nations have found CoVs circulating in the population, causing a cold flu in the shielding flows.
These viruses do not need to be present in the body of a human or an animal.
In contrast, the SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV viruses are not well adapted to humans and their spread in humans cannot be sustained.
They need to survive in the bodies of their carrier animals in order to gain access to humans through one or more animal-derived transgenic agents.
SARS-CoV-2 has similarities to SARS-CoV/MERS-CoV and other HCoVs.
This is something that can spread as widely as HCOVs infections in society, at least in the current time.
However, it is more virulent than the commonly found HCoVs and less virulent than SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV.
It remains to be seen whether it can be adapted to humans and circulate in humans without a storage space or a central refuge in the bodies of animals.
Before discussing the zoological origin of HCoVs, it would be helpful to discuss the definitions and characteristics of evolutionary, natural, reservoir, medium and growth host HCoVs.
An animal that becomes an evolutionary refuge for HCoVs if it provides a close ancestor lineage that is highly similar in relationship to the nucleotide sequence level.
The original virus is usually live and harmless to the environment in which it lives.
Similarly, the HCoV-port pool maker is both stable and long-lived.
In all cases, the hosts are inherently pathogenic and are the primary hosts of the HCoV or the host virus.
Conversely, if a new HCoV introduces a new host before or around its introduction to humans, it is not adapted to the new host and is usually pathogenic.
This, along with the host cell, may be the source of the infection and play a key role in allowing the virus to reproduce where it can subsequently infect humans.
HCoVs may be lethal if they cannot continue to spread in the host medium.
Unlike the usual phenomenon, HCoVs can live on a different organism and can cause serious effects that take time before they are detected.
Here again, the person whose last body infection was present would be the exact same person from whom the infection originated in the first place.
Animal epidemiology data reveals that the most common case of SARS diagnosis is a history of contact with pets.
The follow-up seroprevalence study showed that animal traders experienced an increased SARS-CoV IgG compared to the general population.
The civet-tailed larvae (Paguma larvata) and the racoon dog in the pet trade were the first to be identified as carrying viruses similar to those that are almost identical to SARS-CoV.
This is directly supported by the fact that no further SARS reports were received after the slaughter of all the other Sivets animals in the markets.
However, civets from wild or farmed areas without exposure to live animal markets have been reported to be susceptible to SARS-CoV, suggesting that civets in enclosed spaces may only be a central vector for SARS-CoV transmission but not a host.
In particular, since 80% of the various animals in the markets in Guangzhou are SARS-CoV-proof and the possibility that many small mammalian species may also be the medium for the spread of SARS-CoV hosts cannot be ruled out.
All of these were at the point of death of the SARS-CoV virus in their bodies.
Subsequent studies for the animal host of SARS-CoV have identified a closely related strain of CoV called SARS-Jemagen Rhinolophus CoV HKU3 (SARSr-Rh-JemageCoV HKU3), which is present in Chinese horses.
These genes contain both SARS-CoV-resistant and SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3 class genes.
This and other mouse CoVs are 88-92% associated by nucleotide sequence with SARS-CoV.
These studies laid the foundation for a new theory that the bats host human diseases.
Several SARS-like CoVs (SL-CoVs) have also been identified from mice, but none but one WIV1-genetically modified virus can be classified as a live virus.
Human receptor-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is known to be a SARS-CoV receptor.
The WIV1 gene derived from mouse bone has been used in mice and cats and the human ACE2 gene as a receptor.
Interestingly, the infection with the SARS virus that is getting worse can also disrupt the WIV1.
To date, WIV1 represents the original precursor of SARS-CoV in mice, similar in 95% to the nucleotide sequence homology.
However, there is a broad pattern of association between these two viruses, it is generally believed that WIV1 is not the immediate parent virus of SARS-CoV and the virus is not a direct descendant of SARS-CoV.
Phylogenetic analysis of the MERS-CoV strain into a single group of Jemage CoV-HKU4 and CoV-HKU5 baton.
Both the MERS-CoV and the HKU4 CoVs use a single receptor, dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), for viral entry.
The sequence of RNA-dependent and negative RNA genes from MERS-CoV are similar to those seen in Europe and Africa.
As of this writing, there are no signs of the MERS-CoV virus living in the body of wild boar.
The MERS-CoV virus and its closely related strain CoV-HKU25 are 87% related in their genetic similarity.
So the mosquitoes may not be the ones carrying the MERS-CoV virus.
On the other hand, research in the Middle East has shown that single-toothed camels are more virally resistant to MERS-CoV viruses, similar to camels of Middle Eastern origin that are present in several African countries.
A live MERS-CoV identical to the virus found in humans was isolated from a single-toothed camel's nasal swab, further suggesting that camels serve as a safe haven for MERS-CoV.
It is also noteworthy that a number of mild but viral discharge symptoms have been observed in test camels during MERS-CoV infection.
In particular, infected camels transmit the virus not only through respiration but also through the fecal-oral route, which is also the main source of infection from the parasite.
However, questions remain as many MERS infected individuals have been confirmed to have no history of contact with camels before the onset of symptoms, which is attributed to human-to-human transmission of the virus or by unknown means involving an undetected animal species that is carrying MERS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 shares 96.2% of the nucleotide homology with a CoV RaTG13 battery isolated from Rhinolophus affinis mosquitoes.
As with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the distinction between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is too large to place a parent relationship.
The implication is that bats may not be direct hosts of SARS-CoV-2 unless nearly identical cases of future CoVs are found.
Presumably, the animal hosts of the SARS-CoV-2 medium-sized virus should have been in wild-caught species traded and killed in the seafood market, which many early COVID-19 concerns are linked to, are indications of possible animal-to-human transmission of the disease.
Several recent studies based on metagenomic sequences have suggested that a small, endangered mammal, known as pangolins (Manis javanica), may be carriers of SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoVs.
These novel genome sequences of the CoV pangolin combine the genomes of 85-92% of the nucleotide homology molecular structure with SARS-CoV-2.
However, they are associated with RaTG13 with approximately 90 percent elimination of the nucleotide.
They are grouped into two subtypes of SARS-CoV-2-like viruses in the phylogenetic tree, one of which shares a relatively large receptor-binding domain (RBD) with SARS-CoV-2, with 97.4% evidence of amino acid sequence origin.
However, the rate of mutation of RBDs of SARS-CoVs-2 and their variant RaTG13 is about a million times greater than that of their carrier.
A previous study on pathogenic pangolins also reported the detection of viral traces from lung samples, which were similar to those associated with SARS-CoV-2.
This study adopted a variety of methods of combining the guide catalog to produce a genome sequence that comprises approximately 86.3% of the total viral genome.
We cannot rule out the possibility that the pangolin is one of the animals that carry the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
However, there is currently no evidence in support of the direct pangolin origin of SARS-CoV-2 due to the sequence differentiation between SARS-CoV-2 and the related pangolin-SARS-CoV-2 and beta-CoVs.
In addition, the gap between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is shorter than that between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2 pangolins associated with beta-CoVs.
The transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in mice and pangolins and other animals has become a matter of some dispute.
While the largest sequence of genes is found in RBDs between SARS-CoV-2 and pangolin, SARS-CoV-2-beta-CoVs, SARS-CoV-2 related beta-CoVs and RaTG13 are most closely related in the sequence of genes.
It is widely speculated that the high degree of similarity between the RBDs of the SARS-CoV-2-beta-CoV-beta and SARS-CoV-2 pangolins is due to the evolutionary process that is reversing.
The recommendation is appropriate for recombination between SARS-CoV-2 and beta-CoV-linked RaTG13 in third-generation wild animals.
As a driving force in evolution, recombination is widely spread among beta-CoVs.
Decision makers are still on the zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2.
Apart from the HcoVs viral transmission, animal-derived data also included HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63, and HCoV-HKU1.
Animal genetic evidence suggests that both HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E may have originated from twin CoVs, while parent viruses of HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 have been found in mice.
A strain of CoV called ARCoV.2 (Appalachian Ridge CoV) identified in a three-colored strain in North America has been reported to have a close relationship to HCoV-NL63.
On the other hand, HCoV-229E is closely related to another CoV strain, called Hipposideros/GhanaKwam/19/2008, which was identified in Ghana, while camels are also suspected to be its sponsor.
For clarity, current knowledge about the animal origin of known HCoVs is summarized in Figure 1 and Table 2.
Phylogenetic studies have provided evidence for the incidence of HCoV transmission events in history.
When HCoV-OC43 was first isolated from the species to infect humans from domestic animals in 1890, a respiratory epidemic was recorded.
The history of the HCoV-229E outbreak does not shed much light on it.
The virus was identified from a pair of CoVs that closely resembled the HCoV-229E virus.
Among them is the alpha-alpha alpaca-CoV.
There is considerable evidence that the virus is transmitted directly from the mosquito to the human body.
First, humans but not mammals can interact with bats in sharing environmental science.
Instead, people are drawn to the alpacas.
Second, HCoV-229E-associated cases of al-CoVs are distinct and unusual in mice, while Alpha-CoV causes a sustained outbreak in infected animals.
Finally, no alpaca alpha-CoV has been found in feral animals.
Therefore, the possibility of HCoV-229E originating from the CoV gene from a human strain cannot be ruled out.
Indeed, mosquitoes are the direct source of human viruses including rabies, Ebola, Nipah, and Hendra.
It is therefore not surprising that mice can transmit HCoV-229E directly to humans.
In one way, while alpha-CoVs serve as a production channel for the HCoV-229E pathway, alpacas and sea turtles may serve as intermediate hosts that transmit the virus to humans, similar to the case of MERS-CoV.
MERS-CoV has become a prime example of transmission of communication from bats to camels and from camels to humans.
The evolutionary origin of MERS-CoV from bats was known at its initial detection and confirmed by subsequent studies.
It is clear that bedbugs are the vectors that carry diseases that can be transmitted from animals to humans.
Long-term, multi-national empires, close social ties and the ability of a power to rise are all conditions suitable for the monkey to become a good 'spreader of the virus'.
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has been introduced to dromedary camels for decades.
It is appropriate for those camels that have turned from a luxurious medium to a guard tent and a more natural one.
MERS-CoV causes mild inflammation and maintains low mutation rates in these animals.
The spread to humans occurs so abruptly that humans are the only place where MERS-CoV can no longer spread as a result of its inability to spread.
Unlike the role of camels in MERS-CoV transmission, the role of pangolins, if any, in SARS-CoV-2 transmission is different.
Especially the beta-CoVs of pangolins are the most commonly found in the bodies of pangolins.
They may be a last resort for related SARS-CoV-2-beta-CoVs, similar to civets in the case of SARS-CoV.
The potential for cross-species transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from animals to humans must be either dismissed or accepted in further studies.
First, mice may be a major subset of the SARS-CoV-2 virus-associated lesions that are almost identical to SARS-CoV-2.
Humans can integrate the environment with bats by cutting meat or mining coal.
Second, pangolins may be one of the expansion intermediates introduced by the new SARS-CoV-2 virus.
Humans are infected by slaughtering and eating animal flesh.
It is possible that most mammals including domestic animals are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2.
There is a need to conduct a study on domestic and wild animals for the protection of the body.
Third, as mentioned above, re-infection and adaptation to SARS-CoV-2 may occur in a third species related to bats and pangolins.
Animal-based testing of the origin of SARS-CoV-2 is still ongoing.
In addition to the different animal vectors, there are three other important factors in the transmission of the disease and the transmission of CoVs from the inhibitors.
First, the number of substitutions in RNA division.
Compared to other single RNA molecules, the rate-limiting counterparts of CoVs can be considered as Medium to High with an average active replacement rate of ~10-4 replacements per year by 2 sites, depending on the adaptation process of the CoV to the host host host.
CoVs have a re-exoribonuclease motif, a deletion that results in high complexity and poor or persistent expression.
However, interestingly here, the genetic basis of the virus which mainly inhibits the CoV by binding to the RNA molecules.
Remdesivir is one of the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidates to be tested in clinical trials.
In any case, the rate of CoVs mutation is a million times higher than that of their military allies.
In addition, the rate of mutation is usually higher when CoVs are not compatible with the host.
Compared to SARS-CoV and the main variant, the SARS-CoV-2 mutation rate is significantly lower, suggesting a higher level of acceptance in humans.
Perhaps he is already familiar with someone who lives with the disease in close proximity to others.
In addition to SARS-CoV-2, this also applies to MERS-CoV, which is suitable for single-toed camels.
In theory, it is not necessary that the genetic lineage can produce vaccines and immunizations against SARS-CoV-2 that are ineffective quickly.
Second, the large RNA molecule in the body of the CoVs indicates the origin of mutations and mutations by the genetic basis, which further increases their randomness between species which helps to trigger the infection of the virulent CoVs when they have the appropriate target environment.
This is supported by the abundance of special open disks and the use of coding proteins by the 3′ end of the genome.
Third, Covs can alter the body's bacteria and repeat when RNA is cleaved by special copy-selection.
In the shelter that houses the cadavers, the translocation occurs frequently during the CoV RNA replication.
The development of full-length genomic sequences of recombinant RNAs to produce new CoVs.
Evidence of genetic origin has been found from the biochemical structure of both HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43, as well as from animal CoVs such as bat SL-CoV and batCoV-HKU9.
The integrity of the virus from its habitat and from its transmission.
In addition to the above three aspects of the virus, the interaction of the virus with the host host host is another factor that affects the spread between the species of the virus.
Here, SARS-CoV is included again as a common example, which also demonstrates a positive selection behaviour during transmission between species.
Based on comparative tests between the human and civet isoforms of SARS-CoVs, it is thought that SARS-CoVs may be able to rapidly make a similar appearance in different host populations, particularly with mutations in the RBD S protein.
Generally, RBD in the S-type of the CoV protein interacts with the receptor cell and the immune response.
In SARS-CoV, RBD is located at the 318th to 510th amino acid sequence on the S1 group, which binds to human ACE2 as well as binds to a receptor for viral entry.
The SARS-CoV RBD is able to identify ACE2 receptors of various animals, including bats, civets, rats and raccoons, which allows transmission between virus species.
In fact, only 6 amino acids have been observed to be different from human and civet viral isolates in RBD and 4 of them are in the transporter motor to interact with the ACE2 receptor.
Animal SARS-CoV Sivet has K479N and S487T mutations in RBD, which may increase the likelihood of protein binding to the human ACE2 receptor.
In short, these amino acid substitutes may be of great importance for the reception of the virus in the human body.
It is noteworthy that SARS-CoV-2 shares the same cellular receptor as SARS-CoV.
A 30% difference between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV in the S1 region of the S protein suggests that the endogenous relationship of the S protein to human ACE2 may be altered.
Indeed, cryo-EM studies show a 10 to 20 times greater association from this sample than that between the human ACE2 and the SARS-CoV S protein.
It would also be interesting to know whether any other host would be needed for the spread of SARS-CoV-2.
Interestingly, HCoV-NL63 also binds to ACE2 but with a different S subunit.
There are other HCoV receptors, such as aminopeptidase N for HCoV-229E, and 9-O-acetylated sialic acid for HCoV-OC43.
They may be responsible for successfully regulating the availability of these CoVs in humans after transmitting the species from their host animals.
In addition to the receptor gene, the outcome of interspecies transmission of HCoVs is also controlled by other host-dependent and restriction factors.
The distribution of these proteins between humans and the genetic diversity of HCoVs such as mice, camels and rats can be a barrier to the transmission of infection.
HCoVs must overcome reliance on shelter and then overcome their shelter restrictions to successfully spread between different species.
In this regard, the genetic determinants in this crucial area of interaction with the host virus are still to be identified and can be identified.
An analysis of the uncertainty surrounding the reliance of shelter and containment factors for SARS-CoV-2 using the latest CRISPR technology may be useful.
Outbreak of HCoVs: Back to zero
The variation of the twin CoVs provides sufficient opportunity for the emergence of new and distinct HCoVs.
Based on this argument, the viruses of CoVs are the source of HCoVs infections.
In addition, rapid mutation and gene replication also drive HCoV evolution and serve as two important steps in this process.
For example, the sale or loss of a protein gene and the ground virus have the potential to alter the virus's genetic makeup in some way.
Of the proteins of SARS-CoV, ORF8 is thought to be important in human compatibility, as SARS-CoV-associated viruses have been isolated but chemical differences have been found with the ORF8 protein.
29 mutations from the SARS-CoVs strain were detected in the bloodstream when the disease was first detected in humans.
This cleavage enters ORF8 into ORF8a and ORF8b and is thought to be a substituent that promotes the exchange of proteins.
Subsequently, SARS-CoV has the potential to re-evaluate the history with lineages of alpha- and gamma-CoVs, where a large number of reptilian regions have been identified in RNA-dependent RNA polymerases.
Reverse transcript sites have also been identified in nsp9, most nsp10, and nsp14 segments.
Similarly, it has been shown that the MERS-CoV outbreak has had cross-linear recombination events, which occurred in single-drug strains in Saudi Arabia.
Apart from this SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, mutations have also been observed in other HCoVs, in which HCoVs reassemble with other animal-derived CoVs in unstructured genomes.
It should also be warned that human choice can contribute to unexpected changes in genes, perhaps caused by the easing of pathogens by over selection, such as the immune system.
An example of these effects is the loss of full-length ORF4 in the HCoV-229E strain, as a result of two nucleotide deletions.
While enhanced ORF4 can be observed in HCoV-229E-associated mouse and camel viruses, alpaca camel alpha-CoV exhibits a single nucleotide, which causes a frameshift mutation.
Last but not least, the evolution of new HCoVs is also being driven by selective pressure in their host reservoirs.
Indicator infection or simply symptoms were detected when the bats were infected with CoVs, indicating a correlation between CoVs and bats.
She explained that bats are the genetic filter of CoVs to monitor their body shape and how their organs function.
For example, defects in the anti-inflammatory response plate in the larvae effectively reduce the infection caused by CoVs.
Furthermore, the activity of killer genes in mice is impaired by elevated NKG2/CD94 receptor receptor and low levels of expression of large class I complex antibodies.
Also, high levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) produced by mouse cell activity can crush the CoV replication and affect the receptor readability, thus creating a selective pressure of highly reactive viral generation when introduced into a new host.
Similarly, pathogenic CoVs can mutate through regeneration, which causes the protein forms or protein-specific book to be adapted.
Thus, there is no way that three HCoVs have emerged in the last two decades.
CoVs are not pathogenic or cause minor symptoms in infected populations such as rabbits and camels.
They can spread rapidly without showing any immune response from the infected host.
Herein lies the mystery of why the asymptomatic are seen and what causes the worst cases of infection in humans.
The symptoms are caused by the body's immune system trying to fight the virus, which when it is highly resistant can also cause severe damage to the lungs.
In contrast, among those without symptoms of infection, immune response was lower than that of Cov transmission.
The same strategy of separating the binding and immune response may have beneficial effects in anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapy.
The interferon response is particularly strong in mice.
Therefore, administration of type I interferon at least at the early stage of SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans should be effective.
In addition, activation of NLRP3 in mice is harmful.
Note that the lifetime of the NLRP3 gene and its MCC950 receptor may be affected by the treatment of COVID-19.
The SARS-CoV-2 outbreak followed a series of outbreaks by SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Given that a beta-CoV shares 95% nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV, there is also the existence of a beta-CoV that shares 96% nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV-2.
Given that animal sivets and other animals in markets have been found to contain SARS-CoV-like viruses, no immediate SARS-CoV-2 host has been identified.
Pangolins of highly similar beta-CoVs to SARS-CoV-2 have been found, suggesting that pangolins may be one of the host intermediates or that pangolins of beta-CoVs may contribute spurious fragments to the final form of SARS-CoV-2.
Although questions remain, there is no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 was human-caused intentionally or accidentally.
CoVs have returned to the limelight as a result of the recent outbreak of SARS-CoV-2.
Studies of infectious CoVs in mice and other animals have changed our thinking about the importance of the animal-derived origin of HcoVs in spreading to humans.
A growing body of evidence suggests that SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are of battery origin and are transmitted to humans via the central nervous system.
Given that the SARS-CoV virus originated from human-to-human contact with civets in markets, closing wet markets and killing the emerging cities could end the SARS virus.
For the same reasons, pangolins should be removed from meat markets to prevent animal-to-human transmission, considering the pathogenesis of several pangolins from closely related beta-CoVs to SARS-CoV-2.
However, whether and how SARS-CoV-2 was transmitted to humans by pangolins and other mammals remains to be determined in future studies.
On the other hand, MERS-CoV is present in Arab camels.
These camels were important for transportation and were a major source of meat, milk, leather, and wool for the local people.
They are found throughout the Middle East and Africa.
It is therefore almost impossible to say that all camels should be slaughtered just to control MERS, as was done in the pet market in China to control the SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks.
To stop the spread of MERS, a comprehensive approach should be taken to develop effective immunity to MERS-CoV for camels, along with other infection control measures.
Since we cannot eliminate the pathogens, perhaps new strains of pathogens can be developed that will cause random disease.
Most zoonotic CoVs are spread in the wild.
For example, animal-derived CoVs are still common.
There is a growing body of evidence that CoVs coexist with mutations into CoVs that are rapidly infecting humans and may become lethal in the future.
The practice of eating wild animals in some parts of China should be abandoned to reduce inappropriate contact between humans and animals.
Given the high prevalence of SARS, MERS and COVID-19, it is essential to plan well to deal with it.
In fact, many bacteria have existed in the universe for a long time.
They remain in their original storage tanks until they are able to spread.
Although bats have many features that are particularly susceptible to spreading viruses, the human potential for contact with bats and other wildlife species could be reduced if people were taught to stay away from them.
Continued monitoring in mammals is essential for a better understanding of the biological nature of CoVs and their natural hosts, which will prove useful in preventing animal-to-human transmission and future outbreaks.
The most reliable way to prevent the spread of infectious diseases from animals to humans is for humans to avoid these infected animals.
Many of the facts in the play about the zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2 are still missing.
First, if bats transmit the SARS-CoV-2 ancestor virus to pangolins, it would be interesting to see what conditions bats and pangolin species can live in in the same environment.
Second, if germs play a role in transmitting the disease to humans, how can human contact with germs be confirmed?
Third, if the third mammal is to be a true central host, its interactions with species including humans, bats and pangolins must be clarified.
Finally, the observation that most mammals including domestic ones will be infected with SARS-CoV-2 should be investigated in detail.
Whether it is a zebra, pangolin or other mammal, it is expected that SARS-CoV-2 or its parent virus that is almost identical will be detected in its natural habitat in the future.
Further research in this area will allow for the evolutionary pathway of SARS-CoV-2 in animals, with important implications in the prevention and control of COVID-19 in humans.
Updated COVID-19 testing guidelines considered infected and already diagnosed positive are required
On 6 February 2020, our team published a quick advisory guide for the diagnosis and monitoring of infection with 2019 noro coronavirus (2019-nCoV), and this guide provides us with our expertise and provides a more thoughtful approach to fighting this global pandemic.
However, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a new disease, our awareness and knowledge is gradually increasing based on the ongoing research and clinical practice experience; therefore, diagnostic and treatment strategies are also constantly updated.
In this letter, we have provided a single response to our guidelines and provided a new diagnostic scenario for suspected infection and positive infection based on the latest research and COVID-19 Monitoring Guidelines (seventh edition) issued by the National Health Council of the People's Republic of China.
In December 2019, the 2019 coronavirus (2019-nCoV) caused an outbreak, which is now designated as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and named severe acute viral infection coronavirus disease 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
On 11 March 2020, WHO described COVID-19 as a pandemic.
To combat the spread of SARS-CoV-2 infection, our team developed a rapid consultation guide and this was published online in the Military Medical Journal on 06 February 2020.
It has attracted much attention since its publication.
Note that although COVID-19 is a new disease, our expertise and knowledge are gradually increasing based on the ongoing research and clinical expertise; therefore, diagnostic and treatment strategies are also constantly being updated.
For example, the Review of Investigative and Treatment Standards for COVID-19 issued by the Health Commission of the People's Republic of China (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/), between 16 January 2020 and 3 March 2020, announced a total of seven issues with some context significantly changing.
Now our leadership has received feedback from Zhou et al., They proposed a simple formula based on clinical experience.
Their actions add new evidence to our guidance and give a significant meaning to this global phenomenon.
We are proud of their vital work and show our appreciation for them.
However, their work also needs to be updated according to the latest Diagnostic and Treatment Guidelines for COVID-19 (Testing Phase Seven) and recent findings.
According to the seventh edition (3 March 2020), to confirm the presumption required a combination of each single item of epidemiological history with two items of clinical symptoms for a full diagnosis, or a combination of three items of clinical symptoms if without a clear history of epidemiology:
History of infection: (1) history of travel or residence in Wuhan city and its environs, or other communities with reported COVID-19 infection in the last 14 days before symptoms began; (2) history of contact with SARS-CoV-2 skin infections (with positive nucleic acid testing);(3) history of contact with patients with fever or respiratory symptoms from Wuhan city and its environs, or other communities with reported COVID-19 in the last 14 days before symptoms began;(4) history of contact with a cumulative confirmed ≥ 2 cases of fever and/or respiratory symptoms occurring within 2 weeks in suburban areas such as classrooms, homes, offices, school areas, etc.).
Clinical signs: (1) fever and/or respiratory symptoms; (2) with technical symptoms of COVID-19 infection; (3) total white blood cell count showing normal, decreased, or decreased lymphocyte count at the early stage.
The diagnosis of a confirmed case should be based on suspected infection with any single pathogenic or serological evidence as follows: (1) a positive PCR test for SARS-CoV-2; (2) a photo or video circulating online quickly of all the genetic material that shows high morbidity to known coronaviruses; (3) a positive for specific IgM antibody and IgG antibody to SARS-CoV-2 in serum testing; or a change in SARG-CoV-2-IgG specific IgG from negative to positive, or titer rises ≥4 times in the recovery period which is above critical period.
We can see that the actual PCR test for the actual nucleic acid in the respiratory system or blood samples has increased to the second (18 January 2020) and third (22 January 2020).
Blood cell counts were added in the fourth (27 January 2020) and fifth (8 February 2020); and then serological evidence was added to the seventh edition.
These related modifications have led researchers to continue the work that is to investigate the efficacy of rapid antibody, and samples from respiratory tissue including blood samples, which has increased the production of different antibody products, and supports the production of specific antibody effects in proven standards.
Besides, there is a lot of additional evidence that reminds us to be careful with both patients who are sick and patients who are asymptomatic.
Therefore, the list of Zhou et al. should be updated, as they classify a person without clinical symptoms as "low risk".
There is also a need to ensure a progressive evaluation process in clinical practice and studies.
In conclusion, we look forward to more direct evidence that comes along with a call for readers to express their views.
For the diagnosis of undiagnosed and diagnosed diseases, we recommend identifying and complying with the latest national guidelines.
Our organization will also update our guidance for providing assistance.
Bangladesh reported five new deaths due to COVID-19, the most in a single day.
Yesterday, Bangladesh confirmed five new deaths from COVID-19 on the same day.
This is the highest number of deaths in a single day due to the virus.
Yesterday, the Bangladesh Agency for Disease Control and Research (IEDCR) reported the number of cases which included 114 new cases and 33 cured cases who remained at home.

By March 19, all three had recovered.
SARS-CoV-2 has surpassed one million infections worldwide
As of Thursday, the total number of coronavirus infections with SARS-CoV-2 had exceeded one million worldwide, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.
At least 52 thousand deaths have been reported from COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus.
This achievement comes on the same day as Malawi had its first confirmed coronavirus case and Zambia had its first coronavirus death.

The Portuguese parliament voted to extend the state of emergency within 15 days; the vote was cast with 215 votes in favour, ten abstentions, and one abstention.
Saudi Arabia extended the curfew in the holy city of Mecca and Medina for several days, previously, the curfew was only in place between 3 pm and 6 am.
Thailand has tried to implement a curfew between 10pm and 4am.
Ohio Governor Mike DeWine announced that the state has extended curfews until May 1.
Stores in Australia reduce toilet paper for every transaction
On Saturday and Sunday evening, Woolworths and Coles Australia limited the number of bottles to one or two per customer at its retail stores across the country.
ALDI has crossed the one-digit limit, Monday
The rules are posted on the outlet wall and the store's Facebook page.
Reports indicate that shoppers have been crowding out goods due to fears of COVID-19 and taking extra-security measures.
On Wednesday, Woolworths bought a small amount of toilet paper to deliver home one package per order.
These changes follow the four-pack restrictions or any deal that Woolworths and Coles introduced on March 4 and 5 respectively.
Coles, in his March 8 report that the fourth stage had put a record number of stores selling goods within an hour of unloading, also called the demand for the product "unreasonable" and ALDI in a Facebook post on Tuesday called it "unexpected".
Trading has skyrocketed in the past week, according to a spokesman for Woolworth.
Costco's stores in Canberra have reduced sales to double the number of stores last week.
To further reduce shortages, Coles ordered larger packages from suppliers and increased supply volumes, Woolworths ordered additional stocks, while ALDI invested for a special Wednesday program to begin early.
Russell Zimmerman, president of the National Association of Retailers, said retailers are trying to increase inventory, but local regulations on the arrival time of their vehicles are becoming difficult.
He expected an increase in processing costs in an attempt to meet such a special demand.
On Tuesday, ALDI announced that after the initial release of stocks, some stores will not be able to hold a special Wednesday.
In News.com.au, Dr Gary Mortimer reports that the Small Business Expert from the University of Queensland Science says that shops are full of merchandise every night.
He says that toilet paper is too much, which makes the stock too scarce, and when it's sold out, it leaves a lot of storage space, which makes the stock even scarcer.
"Coles and Woolworths were of the opinion [that] if there were more items on the shelf, if items such as toilet paper and cleaning supplies [were] bought and there were more, there would probably be less panic"," says Russell Zimmerman in ABC News".
The toilet paper reviewer Who gives Crap said last Wednesday they would be gone.
Kimberly-Clark, which makes Kleenex Toilet Tissue, and Solaris Paper which makes Sorbent, stressed that they are working 24/7 to maintain supply, reported News.com.au.
Domain.com, a real estate website, reported that some sellers were giving away free bidding documents to the first bidder at the auction in Melbourne, when the auction was held shortly because buyers had gone on holiday on the long Labor Day weekend.
The Thursday edition of the NT newspaper consisted of eight pages that he had to cut out for use as a bibliography.
Shops initially showed a lack of action from the outset, according to an ABC Australia report on 3 March which said there were no plans to cut down on shopping.
Russell Zimmerman added other much-needed equipment, including face masks, hand soaps, luggage dryers, hand sanitizer, and even a flower.
Similarly, outside Australia, on Sunday afternoon it was noted that the British online retail website Ocado was restricting the sale of Andres toilet paper to two 12-pack packages.
The World Health Organization has declared COVID-19 as a pandemic
The day was marked by the WHO launching the COVID-19 outbreak and the SARS-COV-2 coronavirus as a pandemic.
Although the term anoba refers to the spread of the disease, not the risk of other cases, WHO urges governments to intervene in the fight.
All countries of the world still have the potential to change the face of this pandemic.
"If countries can identify, test, treat, screen, and deploy people to the relief effort", said Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO executive director.
"""We are deeply concerned by both the levels of violence and spread and the levels of stress"."
Dr. Tom Frienden, former Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said the pandemic was "unprecedented".
"He said, in a February CNN interview, ""except for the flu, no other respiratory virus has ever spread from the flu to the global epidemic"."
Ghebreyesus also testified adding that there has never been an outbreak of the coronavirus caused by its spread.
"And we have never seen an epidemic that can be controlled at the same time", he continued.
The new pandemic status follows the decision by WHO in January to declare the outbreak a public health emergency of international concern.
"The director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) in the United States, Dr. Anthony Fauci, said of the outbreak, ""The end of the story, it will be terrible.
The Associated Press currently reports that the number of COVID-19 cases worldwide has reached 126,000 and 4,600 people have died from the infection.
The 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic is an ongoing pandemic caused by the 2019 COVID-19 virus caused by SARS-COV-2.
The outbreak was first detected in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, was declared a Major Public Health Emergency of International Concern on 30 January 2020, and was confirmed as a pandemic on 11 March 2020.
As of 10 April 2020, an estimated 1.61 million people have been infected with COVID-19 in 210 countries and territories, resulting in 97,000 deaths.
Some 364,000 were cured.
The mortality rate is estimated at 4% in China, while the global rate varies between 13.04% in Algeria and .08% in New Zealand.
The main symptoms of the disease include fever and cough and restricted breathing.
Complications can include pneumonia and severe respiratory tract infections.
The time from onset to onset of symptoms is about five days, but it can range from two to fourteen days.
There is no known vaccine or treatment to eliminate it.
The first line of care is related to providing and protecting the environment, protective measures including washing hands, covering the mouth during massage, keeping people away, monitoring and quarantining people who have or are suspected of being infected.
Authorities around the world have responded with measures such as movement restrictions, quarantines, curfews, compliance with workplace safety regulations and lockdowns.
The pandemic has led to severe global economic turmoil, suspensions or cancellations of sports, religion, politics and culture, and a wealth of goods that lead to panic buying.
Schools and universities have closed their doors nationally or in some places in 193 countries, affecting at least 99.4% of the world's student population.
Misunderstandings about the virus are widespread online, and there are occasional comments of racism and discrimination against Chinese, other East and Southeast Asians and their appearance, and others from areas with high infection rates.
As a result of the suspension of travel and closure of major industries there has been a reduction in air pollution.
Health officials in Wuhan reported that the outbreak was detected by the Pneumonia virus on 31 December 2019 after which the investigation was launched in early January 2020.
Most cases are related to the aquarium trade in Huanan and so the disease is thought to be of zoonotic origin.
The virus that caused the outbreak is called SARS-CoV-2, the newly identified virus is related to gemage coronaviruses, pangolin coronaviruses, and SARS-CoV. The first identified case with symptoms was later diagnosed as infectious on 1 December 2019 , and the individual was not clearly related to the previous marketed group of whooping cough.
From the initial reporting of the cases in December 2019, two-thirds were found to be market-related.
On 13 March 2020, an unconfirmed report from the South China Morning Post suggested that a case had started from 17 November 2019, in a 55-year-old man from Hubei Province, possibly the first.On 26 February 2020, WHO reported that, while there were reports of new cases in China but a sudden increase in Italy, Iran, and South Korea, the number of new cases in China exceeded the number of new cases in China for the first time.
There may be a high incidence, especially among those with mild symptoms.
As of 26 February, there has been no decline in cases among young people, aged 19 and under, who make up 2.4 per cent of the global population.British chief scientific adviser, Patrick Vallance, estimates that 60% of the UK population will be infected before effective immunisation is achieved.
The data shows the number of people who have tested for COVID-19 and whose test results show that they are officially positive for the disease.
As of 23 March, no country had conducted more than 3% of the virus testing and most countries had received official orders to test even for those with no mild symptoms. These countries included Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland.
A study published on 16 March found that, in China, as of 23 January, an estimated 86% of COVID-19 infections have been reported, and these unconfirmed infections are the source of 79% of the recorded infections.
A statistical study published on March 30 estimated that the number of infections in Italy was higher than reported.
The initial estimates of the baseline reproduction number (R0) for COVID-19 were 1.4 to 2.4.
A study published by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimated that the average was 5.7 months.
The majority of people infected with COVID-19 are recovering.
For those who did not, the time from onset to death was between 6 and 41 days, with a maximum of 14 days.
As of 10 April 2020 the estimated death toll related to COVID-19 was 97,000.
In China, as of 5 February about 80% of the deaths were in those over 60, and 75% had medical conditions including heart disease and diabetes.The equivalent of death from a COVID-19 infection generally refers to people who died who tested positive for COVID according to official guidelines.
The number of deaths from COVID-19 may be higher as there is a high risk of deaths from untested cases such as those at home and in care homes.
A piece of data from Italy found that the death toll during the pandemic exceeded the COVID death toll by 4-5 times.
"A spokesperson for the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) admitted ""We know that [the reported death toll] is alarming"", information based on classified reports of events in the United States Such unpredictability often occurs in disasters, such as the 2009 H1N1 swine flu. The first confirmed death was in Wuhan on January 9, 2020".
The first case outside China was reported in the Philippines on February 1 and the first case outside Asia was reported in France on February 14.
On 28 February, more than a dozen deaths were reported in China and one each in Iran, South Korea and Italy.
As of 13 March, more than 40 countries and territories have declared the death penalty, on every continent except Antarctica.
These numbers vary by region and duration, and are influenced by the quality of testing, the quality of the health care system, treatment options, since the first outbreak, and demographic factors such as age, sex, and overall health. It shows the death rate divided by the number of diagnosed diseases over a period of time.
According to Johns Hopkins University statistics, the global mortality rate was 6.0% (97,039 / 1,617,204) as of 10 April 2020.
The figures vary from region to region.
In China, the estimated mortality rate has decreased from 17.3% (of those with symptoms from 1 to 10 January 2020) to 0.7% (of those with symptoms from 1 February 2020). Other measures taken include a mortality scale that indicates how many people who have been hospitalized with a disease have died.
These estimates are not time-bound and follow a specific population from transmission to transmission.
Many scholars have tried to figure out the population of a particular segment of society.
The Oxford University Evidence Research Centre estimates that the overall prevalence of the virus is between 0.1% and 0.39%.
The statistics for this range are consistent with results from the first COVID-19 test in Germany, and a statistical study examining the effect of the test on CFR scores.
WHO confirms that the epidemics can be controlled.
The intensity and frequency of the harvest are uncertain and may vary from place to place.
Maciej Bony from Penn State University explained that if untreated the outbreak will rise and begin to decline as the virus loses its viable body.
But it is almost impossible to make any predictions about when that will be.
China's top health adviser Zhong Nashan is of the opinion that it is likely to end in June as the world takes note of the WHO recommendations for measures to limit the spread of the virus.
"On 17 March, Adam Kucharski of the London School of Hygiene &amp; Tropical Medicine stated that SARS-CoV-2 ""will circulate in countries, possibly for a year or two"".
"According to the Imperial College of Education A study led by Neil Ferguson, Social distancing and other measures will be delayed until vaccination is available (at least 18 months or more) ""."
"William Schaffner of Vanderbilt University said, ""I think it's unlikely that this coronavirus - because it's so easily transmitted - will go away completely"" and """" it could be a modern disease, coming back every year"".
The severity of the virus is related to the strength of the immune system against infection and the genetic status of the body.
The symptoms of COVID-19 may be non-specific and infected individuals may not show symptoms.
The most common symptoms were fever (88%) and dry cough (68%).
Some minor symptoms include fatigue, phlegm, shortness of breath, shortness of breath, joint and body aches, sore throat, headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or cyanosis. WHO reports that about one in six people are sick and have difficulty breathing.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) lists emergency symptoms such as difficulty breathing, persistent chest pain or pressure, sudden confusion, unexciting awakening, and a dry face or lips; emergency medical attention is advised if these symptoms are present.The early progression of the disease can lead to severe pneumonia, severe respiratory distress, symptomatic fatigue, sepsis, septic shock and death.
Some infected individuals may be asymptomatic, with no clinical signs but with positive test results, so researchers recommend that those who have been in close contact with infected people should be closely monitored and screened to rule out infection.
The Chinese estimate of total asymptomatic cases ranges from a few to 44%.
The typical incubation period (the time between infection and onset) ranges from one to 14 days; the most common incubation period is five days.Then with the uncertainty example, estimates of outbreaks of COVID-19 in people who have lost their sense of smell and smell started from 30% and later dropped to 15%.
Some speeches on how the disease is spreading are being tried to identify.
There is a primary transmission of the infection at contact with the host and then by droplet received during coughing or sneezing or talking and being within 1 to 2 meters (3 to 6 feet) of a person.
Research has found that an uncovered cluster can produce a wand that can travel 4.5 meters (15 feet) to 8.2 meters (27 feet).
Some have concluded that the virus can be spread by droplets that remain in the air for long periods of time and then be transmitted orally. Similarly, respiratory droplets can occur when a person breathes air outside or while speaking.
The spleen may fall into the mouth or nose of a nearby person and may be sucked into the nose.
Some of the more common respiratory and health procedures such as ventilation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation can be a catalyst for the spread of respiratory illness.
It can also be transmitted when a person touches a contaminated object, including skin, and then touches their eyes, nose, or mouth.
While it can be spread through the bone, it is extremely dangerous.
The Chinese government denies the possibility of transmission of SaRS-CoV-2 infection by the oral route.The virus is spread over three days with no symptoms except that it is likely to spread before symptoms appear or before it crosses to the second stage of infection.
After testing, people were found to be infected for up to three days before the onset of symptoms, suggesting that there is a possibility of infection before the onset of symptoms.
There have been few laboratory reports confirming the severity of the outbreak, but severe outbreaks have been observed in some countries during the course of the outbreak investigation and related investigations.
The European Centre for Disease Control announced that one person can spread the virus to two or three people, and the virus can affect people for days at a time.
In particular, the virus was detected for up to three days on plastic (polypropylene) and 304 stainless steel, for one day on cardboard, and for up to four hours on copper.
This, however, varies depending on the climate and temperature.Pets and other animals have been found to be infected with COVID-19 after testing.
There is no evidence that animals can transmit the virus to humans, but the UK government recommends washing hands after contact with animals and other areas where an infected person may be exposed.
SARS-COV-2 is a rare virus that was first identified in three patients with acute respiratory syndrome in Wuhan, China.
All variants of this novel SARS-CoV-2 virus are derived from the same family of coronaviruses in nature.
It is thought to be of zoonotic origin.
Genetic analysis revealed that the coronavirus is associated with the Betacoronavirus gene, in the subgenus Sarbecovirus (genus B) with two bacterial variants found.
A 96% success rate was shown in the construction of the hallita cell compared to the Bat coronavirus (BatCov RaTG13) model.
In February 2020, Chinese researchers discovered that there is a hallita gene in the kawayr tissue and a link between the virus and the human genome.
A comparison of the genetic components of the pandemic has found a 92% similarity between the coronavirus and SARS-COV-2.
A viral infection can be detected on samples, although the ultimate confirmation is by a reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) infection or CT scan.
A study combining PCR and CT in Wuhan is of the opinion that CT is more responsive than PCR, despite its shortcomings, allowing more of the same to see how some common cold and other infections progress.
"As of March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommends that ""CT should not be used for screening or as a primary test for COVID-19""".
WHO published the test methods for the SARS-COV-2 virus. It published the first version on 17 January.
The test uses real-time polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR).
The test may be done from a respiratory line or even a blood sample.
Full results are usually seen within a few hours to days.
This test is usually done on a nasopharyngeal swab although a throat swab may be used.Most laboratories and companies perform serological tests, which detect the molecule.
As of 6 April 2020, all of these have not been confirmed for their efficacy in the prevalence range.
In the U.S. a serological test developed by Cellex has been approved for safe emergency use in an approved laboratory.
Symptomatic imaging patterns in radiographs and computed tomography (CT) of people with symptoms include asymmetrical glare patterns and unpleasant sensations.
The Italian Radiological Association is compiling an online database of diagnostic results for confirmed cases worldwide.
As a result of interactions with other infections such as adenovirus, imaging without PCR confirmation is not limited to specific detection of COVID-19.
A major study in China compared the results of chest imaging with those of genetic testing, which found a lack of reliable imaging of the disease.It found that the virus is more rapid and more dangerous and recommended a change in the testing method in areas with high infection rates.
Artificial intelligence systems networks are designed to detect viral features with radio and CT imaging.
Prevention strategies include maintaining a thorough personal hygiene, washing hands, avoiding touching your eyes, nose, or mouth with your unwashed hands, and coughing or sneezing in paper and putting the paper in a garbage can.
Those who have already been infected are advised to wear surgical masks in public.
The most important measures taken to control the spread of the disease are the avoidance of contact with others. Most governments have recommended restricting travel and imports to the affected countries.
The response of the epidemic has reached a level of social spread in parts of the world.
This indicates that the virus is spreading across nations, and some residents do not know where or how they are infected. Healthcare providers who care for patients are instructing those infected to use a precautionary approach, contact technique, and eye protection. Tracking those who have come into contact with patients is an important way for health authorities to identify the exact source of the virus and prevent it from spreading.
The use of location data from mobile phones by governments for this purpose has raised privacy concerns, with Amnesty International and over 100 other organizations issuing statements calling for limits on this surveillance.
Various mobile applications have been implemented or introduced for voluntary use, and as of April 7, 2020, several groups of experts are working on private networks, such as using Bluetooth to access the user's proximity to other mobile phones.
Users received messages that if they came into contact with someone who was tested and infected with COVID-19, misunderstandings spread about how to protect themselves from contracting the virus; for example, washing the nose and even mouthwashing does not prevent death from the virus.
There is no cure for COVID-19 but organizations are trying to develop one.
Hand washing is recommended to prevent the spread of the disease.
CDC Requires People to Wash Their Hands Regularly with Soap and Air for At Least 30 Minutes, Especially After Visiting the Toilet or If Hands Are Dirty; Immediately After Nose, Mouth or Hand.
This is because outside the body the virus can be killed by soap, which breaks through the protective pigment.
The CDC adds that use a hand sanitizer with 60% alcohol if no soap or water is nearby.
WHO Recommends People to Touch Their Eyes, Nose and Mouth Without Washing Their Hands.
Disease bacteria can be washed off the surface by a number of treatments (within one minute of exposure to a corrosive to stainless steel agent), a mixture of 62-71 percent ethanol, 50-100 percent isopropanol, 0.1 percent sodium hypochlorite, 0.5% hydrogen peroxide, and 0.2-7.5 percent povidone-iodine.
Other antibiotics such as Benzalkonium chloride and Chrohexidine have a less potent effect.
The CDC recommends that if COVID is suspected or confirmed in an office such as an office or daycare, all areas such as offices, bathrooms, common areas, electronic devices such as tablets, touch screens, key switches, remote controls, and ATM machines used by patients, should be dispersed.
Health organizations have advised the public to cover their mouth and nose by bending their elbows or using a towel while coughing or sneezing and to ensure that the towel is disposed of promptly after completion.
The use of a surgical mask is recommended for those who may be infected, since wearing a mask can shorten the amount of time spent by the dispersed respiratory tract during speech, coughing, and coughing.
WHO has issued guidelines on when and how to use masks.
According to virology expert at the University of Leeds Stephen Griffin, wearing a face mask reduces the risk of hand-washing, which is one of the main sources of infection, especially if the hands are not washed properly.  It is also recommended to use a face mask for nurses who are infected.
WHO recommends wearing face masks to healthy people if they are among those at risk, for example those caring for COVID-19 patients, although they agree that wearing face masks can help people to prevent their faces from being touched.
Several countries have begun to implement Face Protection for members of their communities.
In the U.S., the CDC recommends wearing non-medical face masks that are made of fabric.China specifically recommends the use of masks that can be disposed of by healthy members of the public, especially if they are in close proximity (1 meter (3 ft) or less) to other people.
Hong Kong has mandated the wearing of face masks when entering vehicles and public places.
Thai health officials are increasingly encouraging people to wear face masks at home and wash their faces daily.
The Czech Republic and Slovakia have banned going out in public without wearing a mask or covering one's nose and mouth.
On 16 March, Vietnam required everyone to wear a mask when going to public places to protect themselves and other populations.
The Australian government has ordered that anyone entering a grocery store must wear a mask.
Israel orders residents to wear facial masks.
Taiwan, which has been shipping nearly 10 million Face Masks since mid-March, requires passengers on trains and buses to wear face masks from April 1.
Panama has imposed a ban on masks for any citizen when going out.It recommends that traditional masks be controlled if there is no pattern of buying the original product.
The majority of people are using face masks in Japan, South Africa, Malaysia, Korea and Singapore.
Social distancing (also known as physical distancing) includes infection control practices that are aimed at reducing the spread of disease by reducing close proximity between people.
measures have threatened to isolate, restrict travel, and close schools, workplaces, sports grounds, sports arenas or shopping malls.
Many people can take steps to avoid social distancing by staying at home, reducing travel, avoiding crowded places, using non-confrontational greetings, and isolating themselves from others.
Many governments are now allowing or recommending social distancing in areas where the outbreak has occurred.
The largest gathering by U.S. government agencies and health organizations was quickly reduced to 250 people (if there was no COVID-19 outbreak in the area) to 50, and then to 10.
"On 22 March 2020, Germany banned public gatherings of more than two people. Older adults and those with health conditions such as diabetes, heart disease, respiratory disease, high blood pressure, and compromised immune systems are at increased risk of developing chronic fatigue and complications and have been advised by the CDC to remain indoors throughout the period of the epidemic. In late March 2020, the WHO and other health departments began replacing the use of the term ""social distancing"" with ""physical distancing"", to clarify that the goal is to reduce physical contact during public gatherings, whether physical or intimate".
The slogan "Give interactive distance" has replaced the public mind with total isolation without looking back to interacting with the public in a different way.
It includes the recommendation to have sex with a person who is in the same environment and who does not have the virus or symptoms.
People with coronavirus have been advised to isolate themselves at home with those who suspect they have COVID-19 as a result.
Health authorities have provided detailed information on the necessary quarantine.Several governments have ordered or recommended quarantine for all the population living in the affected areas.
The strictest quarantine orders were given to those in extreme danger.
Those who may have been exposed to someone with COVID-19 and those who have recently traveled to a country or region with widespread transmission are advised to self-isolate for 14 days from the time of the last exposure.
The strategies involved in managing outbreaks are containment, and mitigation.
Efforts to reduce the outbreak are being made in the early stages with the aim of identifying and isolating the infected as well as introducing other infection control measures and vaccination to prevent the spread of the virus to the rest of the population.
When it is not possible to control the spread of the disease, efforts are then pushed to the mitigation stage: measures are taken to slow the spread of the disease and its impact on health systems and society.
Prevention and mitigation measures can be implemented simultaneously.
The summary requires more stringent measures to reverse the outbreak by reducing the original birth rate to less than 1.The epidemic management department is trying to slow the rise of epidemics, known as the epidemic turnaround.
This reduces the risk of medical procedures and allows more time for vaccination and treatment.
Non-medical measures that can prevent the outbreak include personal protective measures, such as, wearing face masks, and self-quarantine; public measures aimed at physical distancing such as closing schools and banning large gatherings; public collaboration to strengthen the adoption and management of such protective measures; and environmental measures such as sanitation of the surfaces.
Some countries have also taken several steps to reduce the spread of the disease.
South Korea has introduced mass testing and home quarantine, and issued a warning about the communities of infected people.
Singapore has provided financial support to those infected who have quarantined themselves and incurred heavy losses for those who have failed to do so.
Taiwan Increases the Incorporation of Face Protective Equipment and Penalises Medical Devices.The UK and US measures show that both the trend (slow epidemic but not contained) and the slowdown (reversed epidemic) have significant challenges.
A smart reduction strategy could lead to a reduction in health care needs by two-thirds and mortality by half. It could also result in hundreds of thousands of deaths with over-developed health care systems.
A suppression step is used for as long as the virus is circulating in the human body (or until a vaccine is available) because transmission can change its mode of action to a relaxed step.
Long-term interventions to eradicate the disease have led to social and economic costs.
There is no proven cure for COVID-19 but efforts are still underway to find a controlled drug trial.
Taking medication and taking plenty of fluids along with rest may help to reduce the severity of the symptoms.
Depending on the severity of the condition, oxygen therapy and intravenous fluid therapy may be required along with ventilation.
The use of steroids can exacerbate the effects.
Many compounds that have been approved for the treatment of other common diseases are being investigated for use in the treatment of COVID-19.
WHO added that some traditional treatments may relieve symptoms caused by SARS-COV-19.
The implementation and delivery of healthcare reforms to meet the needs of COVID-19 patients is a pressing and urgent step as defined by WHO.
ECDC and the European regional office of WHO have issued guidelines for hospitals and primary health services to shift resources at multiple levels, including from laboratory services to COVID-19 testing, cancelling screening procedures whenever possible, isolating and isolating COVID-19 patients, and increasing intensive care capacity through staff training and increasing the availability of ventilators and beds.
There are several theories on where the disease originated (the exact carrier) and from whom it spread.
The first known case of Coronavirus was detected on 1 December 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei, China.
Within a month, the number of coronavirus infections in Hubei has been gradually increasing.
These are mostly associated with the Huanan Aquatic Market, which also sells live animals, and another theory is that the disease originated from one of the animal species; or, in short, it has a zoonotic origin.An unknown pneumonia outbreak was observed on December 26 and was detected by Zhang Jixian's doctor at Hubei Provincial Hospital, who informed the Wuhan Jianghan CDC on December 27.
On 30 December, a team of doctors at Wuhan Central Hospital informed their colleagues about the SARS-like coronavirus.
Eight of the doctors, including Li Wenliang, were arrested by the police for spreading false rumors, and then her senior officer, Ai Fen, was reprimanded for the alarm issue.
The Wuhan Municipal Health Authority later announced the public on 31 December with a briefing to the WHO.
An undiagnosed case was reported to the health authorities in Wuhan to prompt an investigation in early January.During the early period of the outbreak, the infection rate was doubling roughly every seven and a half days in a short time.
In early and mid-January 2020, the epidemic spread to other Chinese provinces, with the use of New China and Wuhan as transport hubs and major railway interchanges.
On 20 January, China reported about 140 new cases in a single day, including two in Beijing and one in Shenzhen.
Data later showed that 6,174 people had been infected with the virus as of 20 January 2020.Since 26 March, the United States has overtaken China and Italy with the highest number of confirmed cases in the world.As of 9 April 2020, more than 1.61 million cases have been reported worldwide; more than 97,000 people have died and more than 364,000 have recovered.
At least one case in 200 countries and territories.
Due to the pandemic in Europe, several countries under the Schengen Agreement have curtailed movement to regulate border crossings.
National measures include measures to reduce the spread of the virus such as quarantines (i.e. stay-at-home orders, shelters, or even lockdowns) and even a state of emergency.On 2 April, nearly 300 million people, or about 90% of the population, were subject to a lockdown in the United States, more than 50 million people were locked up in the Philippines, about 59 million people were locked up in South Africa, and 1.3 billion people were facing lockdowns in India.
On March 26, 1.7 billion people worldwide were under some form of lockdown, which rose to 2.6 billion people in two days - nearly a third of the world's population.
The first case of COVID-19 was detected on 1 December 2019 in Wuhan; in an unconfirmed report it was the first case since 17 November.
Dr. Zhang Jixian observed and observed the accumulation of symptoms of non-communicable pneumonia on December 26, which prompted her hospital to notify the Wuhan Jianghan Infectious Disease Control Agency on December 27.
The first human viral test of the patient conducted on 27 December 2019 showed the presence of a virus similar to the SARS coronavirus.
A full Public Notice was issued by the Wuhan Health Authority on 31 December.
The World Health Organization (WHO) was notified on the same day.
"As these announcements took place, the police warned Wuhan doctors against ""spreading rumors"" about the blessing".
The Chinese Health Authority initially acknowledged that there was no confirmed human-to-human transmission.
"In late January, the Chinese government launched a follow-up plan that Communist Party of China general secretary Xi Jinping described as a ""people's war"" to contain the spread of the virus".
"In what is estimated to be the largest mass isolation in human history", a Sanitary Cordon was declared on 23 January, banning travel in and out of Wuhan, which was later extended to 15 cities in Hubei, affecting an estimated 57 million people".
Vehicles were not allowed to travel in the city.
Chinese New Year celebrations (January 25) were cancelled in many places.
The authorities also announced the construction of a temporary hospital, the Huoshenshan Hospital, which was completed in 10 days.
A hospital was built next, the Leishenshan Hospital, to treat more patients.

France and Britain adopted the German temporary plan.
The traditional rights sector has faced challenges in this pandemic, which has affected the performance of human rights organizations and independent human rights activists around the world.
Cultural organizations are actively supporting as usual in creating a cultural identity of the community and protecting the health of the staff and the local community while helping the entertainers as much as possible.
In March 2020, around the world, museums, libraries, cultural venues, and traditional festival venues, were permanently closed with their symbols such as entertainment and festivals being cancelled and others being suspended.
In response there have been efforts to provide other services through digital platforms.A recent trend that is accelerating the end of the pandemic is the cancellation of religious services, large sporting events, and other social events, such as music festivals and concerts and art fairs, and body art exhibitions.
The film industry is facing a downturn, and the Vatican has announced the religious week for kibbutzim in Rome, which took place last week during the Christian Lent season, has been canceled.
Many elders have recommended that elderly Christians stay at home rather than attend Mass on Sundays; some churches offer services through radio, video-on-line or television, while others offer a seated service in a car.
With the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Rome closing its churches and places of worship and St. Peter's Square to Christian attackers, other religious groups have also cancelled services and restricted gatherings in churches, mosques, synagogues, temples and streets.
The Iranian Ministry of Health announced the cancellation of Friday prayers in the affected areas and the affected places of worship later, while Saudi Arabia banned the entry of foreign pilgrims and residents to its holy places in Mecca and Medina.
The pandemic caused the biggest loss to the world sports calendar since World War II.
Most of the tournament's matches, including the 2019-20 UEFA Champions League season, the 2019-20 UEFA Euro 2020 season, the 2019-20 NBA season, and the 2019-20 NHL season, have been cancelled or postponed.
"After the explosion of plans to host the 2020 Summer Olympics, which were scheduled to begin in late July; the International Olympic Committee announced on 24 March that ""the festival will be rescheduled until 2020 but not beyond the summer of 2021"". Casinos and other gambling venues around the world are closed and local sporting events are either suspended or suspended".
This has led to a resurgence of online gambling and the increasing number of new members on gambling sites.The case is particularly relevant in the entertainment sector where most music groups have restricted or cancelled their games.
Several western platforms such as the one on Broadway banned all the shows.
Some gamers' associations have developed ways to further integrate and share their work through the web instead of the usual public play methods, such as instant video streaming on the web and even creating boxes on websites for gamers to have and share their games.
Media has been bombarded with humorous images of the coronavirus as many of them focus on entertainment to distract attention from the uncertainty of the end of the pandemic.
Since the COVID-19 outbreak, discrimination, racism, and racism against Chinese and Middle Eastern people, as well as people from conflict zones in Europe, the United States and other countries, has been rampant.
Cases of fear, criticism, and kidnapping have been experienced in many countries especially in Europe, East Asia, North America and even the Asian Pacific.
Reports from February (while the number of cases is limited to China) contained data on how other countries are discriminating against Chinese citizens.
Some African countries see more ethnic discrimination against Chinese.
Many residents of Wuhan and Hubei have reported racism based on their regional origin.
Chinese are being supported, both online and offline, by those in the most affected areas.
Following the ongoing outbreak in several new countries, people from Italy, the first country in Europe to experience a severe COVID-19 outbreak, are facing the risk of racism and discrimination. Citizens in countries including Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore, and South Korea have started signing petitions calling for banning Chinese from entering their countries in an effort to stop the outbreak.
In Japan, the hashtag #ChineseDontComeToJapan has made an impact on Twitter.
Chinese and Asian communities in Britain and the U.S. have reported increased racism, as well as attacks.
U.S. President Donald Trump Faces Criticism for Calling Coronavirus "Chinese Virus", a term used by critics as an anti-Chinese racist term
Protesters in Ukraine attacked vehicles carrying citizens and others trying to escape from the city of Wuhan to Novi Sanzhary.
Students from Northeast India bordering China, who are studying in Other Indian Cities Faced with Quarantine Due to Coronavirus Outbreak.
Bharatiya Janata Party regional leader in West Bengal Dilip Ghosh said that the Chinese have ruined the culture and that God should take revenge on them.
"The Chinese Labour Union later condemned the speeches in Kolkata, saying it was ""a mistake"". In China, an outbreak of racism and bigotry against Chinese residents did not occur as a result of the pandemic, with foreigners being described as ""foreigners"" with the intention of ""disclosure"".
Most newspapers have removed Wallpapers in all their reports One Monitoring the Corona Virus.
Many scientific publishers have made scientific papers related to the outbreak available for public reading.
Some scientists have chosen to release their results in real time via the bioRxiv edition software.
Rapid viral outbreak - A rapid viral outbreak, often in an outbreak or transmission environment

The test suite for respiratory coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and related SARS-CoV-2 infection includes methods for detecting the presence of the virus and those that detect the immune cells produced as a result of infection.
RT-PCR detects the virus in the sample, which detects the coronavirus RNA.
The test was specifically designed to detect the RNA of the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
It is used to confirm a diagnosed or existing disease.
Serology is used by testing and population monitoring.
An immunoassay shows how many people have been infected, even those with mildly reported symptoms.
The number of deaths and the prevalence of the disease in humans can be found in the test.
Due to limited testing, as of March 2020 no country had reliable data for the prevalence of the virus in its population.
As of 23 March, no country had tested 3% of the world's population, and there was considerable variation in the number of tests performed across countries.
This discrepancy may also affect the reporting significance of the severity of the infection, which is likely to be higher than in other countries.
Using real-time transcription of the plymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) the respiratory tract can be tested which is obtained by various means, combined with nasopharyngeal transcription or sputum sampling.
results are obtained in a few hours to 2 days.
RT-PCR testing is usually done with a throat swab but is possible only in the first week of infection.
The virus then disappears for a week as it continues to multiply in the lungs.
For those infected and tested in the second week, a sample may also be taken from the respiratory tract using a catheter or a sputum.
One of the PCR tests at Charite in Berlin was developed in January 2020 using real-time transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR), and a 250,000-base sample was prepared for distribution by the World Health Organization (WHO).
The European Union has co-sponsored a trial on 23 January 2020.The North Korean company Kogenebiotech developed a new formula, the PCR-based SAR-CoV-2 test (Powercheck Corona virus) on 28 January 2020.
"It searches for the ""E"" shared by all beta coronaviruses, and the RdRp specific gene for SARS-CoV-2.In China, BGI Group was one of the first companies to receive emergency use approval from the National Health Administration for PCS-CoV-2 fatty acid detection-In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) is distributing its latest Coronavirus-2019 (2019-nCoV) Real-Time-Right-Right RT-PCR Testing Centers to public health testing sites through the International Reagent Resource".
One of the test cells had one that had become incomplete due to a compound problem and was at the CDD test bottle in Atlanta; this brought about 100 samples that were completely intact by February 2020.
The use of the two test kits did not prove effective until 28 February 2020, and until the states and laboratories were given permission to test.
The test was approved by the Food and Drug Administration under the Emergency Management Division. The drug's testing laboratory in the US began testing in early March 2020.
On 5 March 2020 LabCorp announced the availability of a nationwide COVID-19 test based on RT-PCR.
Quest Diagnostics which has been nationwide standardized COVID-19 testing available from 9th March 2020
No limit is stated, samples taken and processed must be done according to CDC requirements
In Russia, COVID-19 testing has been developed and is managed by the State Research Institute of Virology and Biotechnology VECTOR.
On 11 February 2020 the test was submitted from the Federal Service for Surveilance in the health sector. On 12 March 2020, Mayo Clinic reported that there was a COVID-19 testing system. On 13 March 2020, Roche Diagnostics received FDA approval to perform the test in a maximum of 3.5 hours, although they would have to leave the machine to perform approximately 4,128 tests in 24 hours.
On 19 March 2020, the FDA granted emergency use authorization (EUA) to Abbott Laboratories for testing on Abbott's m2000 system; the FDA has granted similar authorizations to Hologic, LabCorp, and Thermo Fisher Scientific.
On 21 March 2020, Cepheid received an EUA from the FDA for a 45-minute trial.
The FDA has approved a test using isothermal nucleic acid amplification technology instead of PCR.
Since this does not require any weather system, the method can produce a positive result in five minutes and an uncertain result in 13 minutes.
There are currently about 18,000 of these in the US and Abbott expects to produce an additional 50,000 tests per day.A monoclonal antibody test that eliminates the nucleacapsid protein (N Protein) of the coronavirus strain is being developed in Taiwan, with the expectation that it can give a result in 15 to 20 minutes like the flu.
"A review of the March 2020 literature concluded that ""chest radiographs are of little value for diagnosis in the early stages, while CT [computational tomography] scans may be available even before symptoms appear"."
Known CT features include bilateral multilobar ground-glass opacificities and periheral, asymmetric and posterior distributions.
The spread of the disease is enhanced by subpleural invasion, cleft skin, and stretching.
The analysis of PCR to CT testing in Wuhan as the source of the current outbreak suggests that CT is more infectious than PCR, although it is not specifically diagnosed, and most imaging techniques are associated with certain pulmonary infections and infectious processes.
"In March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommended that CT should not be used in early testing of COVID-19".In March 2020, the CDC recommended PCR for early testing".
The immune system is made up of IgM and IgG.
They can be used to detect people who are infected starting from 7 days or so after the first signs of infection, for detection and prevention, and to monitor the population.The Assays can be used in a laboratory test (CLT) or by point-of-care (PoCT) testing.
High-throughput automation in many laboratories can perform these tests but availability will depend on how much is produced for each device.
For CLT a single lateral blood sample is usually used, although regular blood samples can also be used for follow-up immunotherapy.
PoCT is a single blood sample taken from a debane by skin puncture.
Unlike PCR methods there is no need for a pre-testing stage.On March 26, 2020, the FDA allowed 29 individuals to provide official notification as required and now have the ability to distribute their own immunoassay.
The FDA approved the test on April 7, 2020, under the use of emergency authorization in late March 2020.Euriommum Medical Laboratory Diagnostics and Epitope Diagnostics have received European Approval for their test kits that can detect IgG and igA antibodies against the virus in a blood sample.
The size of the test is a large number of sample studies in hours and is much faster than the usual viral RNA PCR assay.
Immunity can be detected 14 days after the onset of the disease.As of early April, the UK had no antibody testing kits available for purchase and use.
"Hong Kong has devised a scheme whereby suspected infected people stay at home, ""the emergency department will give a sample tube to the patients"", they will spit out a sample, send it to their place and get the results of the test later. The UK NHS has announced a pilot test scheme for testing suspected infected people at home, which eliminates the risk of transmission from patients to others when they come to the hospital or by washing the virus from the car and ambulance bodies if used. By eliminating the common COVID-19 test for suspected infected people, the health department will use a sample tube to determine whether or not to use the same protective measures".
Nearby testing facilities enable South Korea to perform rapid and cost-effective testing in every country.In Germany, doctors at the National Association of Statutory Health Insurance said on March 2, that they have a capacity of 12,000 tests per day in the system and 10,700 were inherited last week.
The cost to the insurance company when the doctor orders the test.
According to the headmaster Robert Koch, Jamaus has a capacity of 160,000 tests a week.
From 19th of March, a series of tests were carried out in major cities.
As of 26 March 2020 the number of tests in Germany is unknown, except for the confirmed cases.
"Preliminary laboratory tests confirmed that in week 12/2020 about 483,295 samples were tested up to and including week 12/2020 and 33,491 samples (6.9 percent) were positive for SARS-COV-2.In Israel, researchers at the Technion and Rambam Hospital developed and performed a randomized controlled trial for sample testing from 64 nurses overseas, by testing samples to confirm that only the sample complex was stable.In Wuhan there was found about 2000-sq-meter emergency laboratory called Huo-Yan (Chinese: 火眼, or ""Fire"" in English) which was opened by BGI on 5 February 2020, which can test about 10,000 samples per day".
With the supervision of the building's founder Wang Jian, the 5-day trial showed a 47% infection rate in Hubei and the same cost of quarantine that would double the cost where the test volume was not available online.
Wuhan testing laboratories followed by Hou-Yan testing laboratories in Shenzhen, Tianjin, Beijing, and Shanghai in all 12 cities across China.
On 4 March 2020, the total daily test volume was 50,000. Designed and released by Origami Assays, the open source Multilexed was released to test a sample of 1122 COVID-19 patients using 93 assays without the need for robotic water handlers.
In March, a lack of reagent and a lack of testing prevented the production of large quantities of peppercorns in the European Union (EU) and the UK and the US.
This led some authors to study the preparation of a sample-processing process that included heating the sample at 98 °C (208 °F) for 5 minutes to extract RNA genomes for further testing. On 31 March it was announced that the United Arab Emirates had begun testing the coronavirus in its population more than any other country, and were working to increase the testing rate to reach the entire population.
This was achieved through the combination of drive-through testing, the purchase of population-scale mass-throughput testing equipment from 42 organizations and BGI (based on the Huo-Yan rapid detection laboratories in China).
Built in 14 days, the laboratory can handle 10,000 RT-PCR tests per day and is the first to operate outside China.
Different test kits for the coronavirus's molecular components have been developed in China, France, Germany, Hon Kon, Japan, and the U.S.
The World Health Organization adopted the German system of testing a test specimen that was sent to low-income countries that lack natural resources to test their own.
The German recipe was published on 17 January 2020; no agreement was reached with the US Centers for Disease Control until 28 January, delaying the production of tests in the U.S. China and the United States had problems with the safety of test kits at the beginning of the outbreak, and these countries and Australia failed to provide enough test kits to satisfy the demands and recommendations of health experts.
Besides, experts say that the help of the high number of tests available in South Korea has helped to slow the spread of the coronavirus.
The testing facilities, mostly private laboratories were built for decades by the South Koiya Government.
On March 16, the World Health Organization stated that testing is the most effective and efficient way to combat the COVID-19 pandemic.There is a high demand for vaccines as the virus spreads which has led to a backlog of testing in U.S. laboratories and the provision of a sample and test chemical is highly toxic.
In March 2020 China reported problems affecting the quality of the equipment.
In the United States, the test product ordered from the CDC was in trouble until the government removed the component that prevented the commercial laboratory from operating.Spain purchased the test product from the Chinese company Shenzhen Bioeasy Biotechnology Co ltd and found that the results were ineffective.
The company explained that the incorrect results could be the result of failure to pack samples or use the goods correctly.
The Spanish authorities said they would remove the negative test kits and replace them with a different variant of Shnghen Bioeasy. 80% of the Czech Republic's test kits purchased in China had negative results. Slovakia purchased about 1.2 million test kits in China which had negative results.
Prime Minister Matovic recommended that it be stored in the Danube Ates Kara of the Turkish health officials said that the test kit purchased by Turkey from China was highly flawed and not used.The UK had purchased about 3.5 million test kits from China but in early April 2020 they said that this could not be used.
Testing, follow-up and quarantine of those who are positive for the virus and finding those who have had contact with those infected with SaRS-CoV-2 who have had an adverse interaction that leads to infection.
Researchers working for VO Italy in the area where the first COVID-19 deaths were detected in Italy, conducted a series of tests on a total population of 3,400, approximately ten days apart.
Almost half of the infected do not show symptoms and all infected individuals are quarantined.
Traffic congestion, which has killed some diseases altogether.
With close contact tracking, domestic travel, testing and quarantine, the 2020 coronavirus pandemic in Singapore is moving more slowly than in other developed and developing countries, but there are no contractions such as restaurant closures and grocery stalls.
All activities were suspended, with Singapore announcing a stay-at-home order on 28 March, but schools reopened on 23 March.
Several countries have prevented the spread of the epidemic by tracking contacts, restricting travel, testing and travel of infected individuals and isolating them but not restricting people from traveling as Iceland and South Korea have.
Statistics show that countries that have tested well, which affects the death rate, have fewer grandchildren, perhaps because these countries are better able to detect those with fewer or no symptoms.
WHO recommended that countries with limited testing capacity and national laboratories with limited experience on COVID-19 should send the first five positive tests and the first ten non-contagious COVID-19 samples one in 16 of the WHO laboratory evidence confirming the test.
Of the 16 laboratory samples, 7 are in Asia, 5 in Europe, 2 in Africa, 1 in North America, 1 in Australia.
In these charts, the column Confirmation as % of tests is influenced by the national test system.
A country that only tests hospitalized people will have a high positive score as a % of all tests of its citizens, whether they show symptoms or not, if other factors are consistent.
Handwashing, also known as hand sanitization, is a method of washing hands to remove dirt, grease, germs, or other unwanted substances.
"Regular hand washing with soap and "critical time" during the day prevents the spread of many diseases, such as diarrhea and cholera, which are spread through the mouth.
People can also contract pneumonia or the common cold, for example if they do not wash their hands before touching their eyes, nose, and mouth.
The five most important times of the day are the following: before and after using the toilet, after cleaning and changing the baby's napkin, before feeding the baby, before eating, before and after cooking, and after handling raw meat, fish or farm produce.
If soap and water are not available, hand washing with ash is recommended by WHO:
Before, during, and after cooking.
before and after visiting a patient.
After changing a child's diapers or cleaning the child's toilet.
After sneezing, coughing, or sneezing.
After touching an animal, the food of the animals and the bones of the animals.
Medical hand hygiene refers to the cleanliness of medical work.
Washing hands before administering medicine or treatment can prevent or even reduce the spread of infection.
The main health reason for hand washing is to remove certain microorganisms (pathogens such as bacteria, viruses, or other microorganisms that cause disease) and chemicals that can cause harm or disease.
This is especially important for people who work in the food or health fields, and it is important for society as a whole.
Hand washing has been shown to be beneficial in reducing the incidence of influenza, coronaviruses and other contagious diseases, preventing the spread of diarrhea and reducing the incidence of pneumonia.
And reduce the number of babies born at home.
A 2013 study suggested that improved hand-washing practices may lead to less growth in height and growth in children under five years of age.
In developing countries, infant mortality from respiratory diseases and diarrhea can be reduced by introducing behavioral changes such as hand washing with soap.
This simple step could reduce the death rate from these diseases by almost 50%.
Protection that increases the quality of the hand towel can reduce diarrhea by about one third, and this can be compared to providing clean water to the poor.
48% reduction in diarrheal infections can be linked to hand washing with soap. Hand washing with soap is the most effective and convenient way to prevent diarrheal and pneumonia infections as is done in schools, homes and communities worldwide.
Pneumonia, the most common ARI, is the leading cause of death among children under five years of age, affecting an estimated 1.8 million children annually.
Diarrhea and pneumonia cause the deaths of some 3.5 million children each year.
According to UNICEF, hand washing with soap before eating and after using the toilet is a common practice that saves more lives than any vaccine or treatment, cutting the risk of diarrhea by almost half and death from respiratory failure by one-quarter.
Hand washing is always combined with other water purification procedures as part of water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH).
Hand washing also protects against impetigo (skin infection) that is spread through physical contact.
A minor problem with hand washing is that excessive hand washing can cause skin damage due to dry skin.
A 2012 study found that excessive hand washing can cause itching, the most common hand-washing among healthcare workers.
Frequent hand washing is also considered to be one of the symptoms of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD).
There are five times a day when hand washing with soap is essential to reduce the spread of oral infections: after using the toilet (washing, not rinsing), after fixing the baby's diaper (changing the napkin), before feeding the baby, before eating and before/after processing food or handling raw meat, fish, or chicken.
Other times when careful handwashing measures should be taken to prevent the spread of infection include before or after handling a cut or wound; after touching a bone or animal; and after touching dirt.
In many lands, hand washing with soap is a rare occurrence.
A handwashing study in 54 countries in 2015 found that on average 38.7% of households wash their hands with soap.A 2014 study showed that Saudi Arabia had the highest percentage of 97% of the state followed by the near-central United States with 77% followed by China with the lowest 23%.[citation needed] Much of the climate change is increasing handwashing and soap standards at critical times.[citation needed] Handwashing for schoolchildren during daylight hours is one option in developing countries to make children's commitment to handwashing a part of their behavior.
The "Essential Health Program" implemented by the Philippine Department of Education is an example of a policy to improve children's health and education.
Cleaning twice a year, which is aided by washing hands regularly with soap, brushing daily with Fluoride, is the essence of this national program.
It has also been successfully implemented in Indonesia.
Removing invisible microorganisms from the skin is further improved when soap or soap powder is added to water.
The basic step of soaps and soap powder is to reduce the barrier to success and increase digestion.
Water alone is essential for cleansing the skin, for oil and proteins, which are of soil origin, are insoluble in water.
Cleansing is done by running water.
Water soap because it can be reused at any time, can retain bacteria from previous use.
A small study showed that the transfer of bacteria from contaminated soap is not complete as the transfer of bacteria goes with the bubble.
The CDC states that "source water and drainage systems for discharge are the best".
Communities are being warned to use disinfectant soap.
To date, there is no evidence of its use in antibiotics or in environmentally resistant organisms.
However, antibacterial soaps contain antibiotic agents such as triclosan, which contains a large sequence of molecular structure elements.
So even if antibodies are not selected for antibacterial soaps, they probably won't be as effective as advertised.
Besides surfactant and skin protective agent, the cosmetic formula may contain lactic acid (acetic acid, ascorbic acid lactic acid) As a PH regulator, antimicrobial active benzoic acid and enhance skin condition (aleo vera, vitamin, menthol, plant extract) A summary study from the University of Oregon School of Public Health found that soap is as transparent as antibacterial soaps that are flavored with triclosan for protection against infections and kill bacteria by hand.
Hot water, which is as comfortable as handwashing, is not hot enough to kill germs.
Bacteria thrive at temperatures as high as 37 degrees Celsius.
Even so, hot water, soap, and water are more effective than cold water, soap is more efficient than oil removal, and the tiny particles are invisible to the eye.
Contrary to popular belief, scientific research has shown that the use of hot water has no effect on reducing the number of microbes in the hand.
Hand sanitizer or antibacterial ointment originally a waterproof hand sanitizer.
In the late 1990's and early 21st century, alcohol- and water-free hand sanitizers (also called alcohol-based hand sanitizers, medical hand sanitizers, or hand sanitizer) have become popular.
Most rely on isopropyl alcohol or ethanol mixed with a thickening agent such as Carbomer (a polymer of acrylic acid) in an oil, or a hemectant such as glycerin in water, or a foam for ease of use and then to reduce the drying effect of the alcohol.
Adding hydrogen-peroxide, to keep up with the available processes, hand sanitizers containing at least 60-95% are the most effective at killing bacteria.
Hand ointment is a disinfectant, anti-inflammatory, anti-bacterial, and anti-tumor medicine against several viruses (MRSA and VRE) including tuberculosis and other viruses (including HIV, animal diseases, RSV, rhinovirus, vaccinia, influenza and hepatitis) and fungi.
Alcohol-based hand sanitizer containing 70% alcohol kills 99.97% (reduction of log 3.5, equivalent to decbel 35 reduction) of bacteria on the hands 30 seconds after rubbing and 99.99% to 99.999% (reduction of log 4 to 5) of bacteria on the hands 1 minute after rubbing. Hand sanitizer has an effective effect on bacterial bacteria and a subtle effect on viral bacteria.
Alcohol hand sanitizers have no effect on norovirus, the most common cause of gastroenteritis (gastric ulcers).An antiseptic or alcohol must be used to wet or cover both hands.
The front and back of the hands and between the edges of all the fingers are rubbed for about 30 seconds until the water, foam or detergent is dried.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends washing hands with hand sanitizer, especially if hands are exposed to physical dirt.
The further use of these agents It is based on the ease of use and quick killing functions on bacteria However they should be used as a substitute for proper washing unless and when there is no water or soap.
Excessive use of alcohol-based hand sanitizers can cause dry skin unless emollients and/or anti-drying agents are included in the mixture.
The drying effect or removal of the hand sanitizer can be reduced by adding glycerin and/or emollient by the brush.
In clinical trials, alcohol-based hand sanitizers containing emollients caused less skin irritation and dryness than soap or antibacterial soap.
Allergic contact dermatitis, allergic urticaria pain or allergy to chemical or solvent in hand washing liquid does not occur.
The lack of risk of contact with dermatitis has become a major attraction over hand washing with soap and water.
Despite their effectiveness, the agent of the water is not cleaning the hands, but it is contaminating them.
This is why hand sanitizer is less effective than hand washing with soap and water because it prevents the spread of many bacteria, since other infections can be found on the hands.
The use of hand sanitizer oil depends on its composition and the location, and historically it has had little use as a lubricant.
Recently, chemical formulations of benzalkonium chloride have been shown to have a rich and accumulated antimicrobial activity after use, unlike alcohol, which decreases in efficacy after repeated use, possibly as a result of the development of severe skin lesions.
Many people in poorer societies cannot afford to buy soap and use ashes or dirt instead.
Soil or soil may be more useful than water, but it is less useful than soap.
Another concern is that if soil or ash is contaminated with microbes, it may increase the spread of the disease rather than reduce it.
Like soap, ash is also a representative of soap because it can release bacteria when mixed with alkali to form alkaline compounds.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends using ash or soil instead of soap if soap is not available.
The most effective handwashing practices by the US Centers for Disease Control to prevent the spread of infection are as follows:
Wash your hands with hot or cold running water.
The use of running water is recommended because water in a valley may be contaminated while hot or cold water will not change anything.
Blow the hands by rubbing them thoroughly with soap, including the back of the hand, between the fingers, and under the fingertips.
Soap cleanses the skin, and research shows that people wash their hands thoroughly when using soap instead of water.
The massage lasts at least 20 seconds.
Brushing creates a strong grip, which helps to remove bacteria from the skin, and a long brush removes many pathogens.
Tie them tightly in running water.
A hand tied in a bowl can be a hand again.
A clean towel and a breath of air in bed dry the skin.
The most common areas of motion are the big toe, wrist, between the hand and palm, between the fingers, and the base of the toes.
A person's fingers that are covered with a toothpick can retain germs.
It is recommended to use a face mask to prevent hands from drying out, dry skin can cause skin damage which can reduce the risk of infection.
There are several simple methods that can be used to improve hand washing where there is no tap water and/or soap available, for example, pouring water from a hanging jar or a perforated hole or using a body of moss with holes and/or ash if it needs to rise in developing countries.While there is a lack of water (such as schools or villages in developing countries), there are water conservation methods such as hanging pots and other simple methods.
Handless foot-drainage is a simple technique that involves tying a bow and rope, and where the foot is tapped to pour a little water on the hands with a bar of soap.
Hand drying is a good way to clean hands but there is debate over the best way to dry in public toilets.
Researchers have developed the idea and recommend that paper towels are more hygienic than the electric hand dryers found in many bathrooms.
In 2008, a study by the University of Westminster, London, led by the European Tissue Symposium, compared the hygiene standards of paper towels, hand-dryers and hand-air dryers.
After washing and drying hands with a warm-air dryer, it was found that the total number of microscopic molecules invisible to the eye increased in the face by at least 194% and the hands by 254%.
Drying with a dryer increases the average number of bacteria on the fingers by 42% and in the palm by 15%.
After washing and drying the hand with paper towels, the total number of bacteria on the bottom of the fingers decreased by up to 76% and on the palm by up to 77%. Scientists also conducted some tests to determine whether there could be contamination between toilet users and the toilet environment itself due to any type of drying.
A simple, shallow-air vacuum cleaner, which blows air out of the unit at 180 m/s (650 km/h; 400 mph) can dry out the microorganisms from the hand and machine and can damage the users of other washing machines and the environment of the dishwasher up to 2 meters high.
The use of a dryer and air heater spreads microorganisms up to 0.25 meters from the dryer.
The rubber cloth shows no dispersion of micro-organisms. In 2005, in a study by TUV and the Environmental Environment, various methods of hand drying were evaluated.
The following changes in viral counts after observation of dry hands:
Many manufacturers of hand dryers exist, and a hand dryer has been likened to a paper towel.
Hand washing using hand sanitizer is an alternative while traveling when soap and water are not available.
Alcohol-containing hand sanitizer should contain at least 60% alcohol.
The medical handwashing system was made mandatory by Hungarian Ignaz semmelwais in 1846 to prevent the spread of disease in hospital premises.
There are electronic reflectors to remind hospital staff to wash their hands when they forget.
One study found both reduced infection and benefits.
The medical handwashing procedure takes at least 15 minutes, with plenty of soap and water or oil used to foam and lubricate each part of the hand.
Rub your hands together, so that the fingers are in contact.
If there is debris under the thumb, a brush can be used to remove it.
Since germs can live in the water left on our hands, it is important to wrap them well and wipe them with a dry, clean towel.
After drying, use a paper towel to cover the water (open any exit doors if possible).
This prevents re-contamination of the hands with these surfaces.
The purpose of handwashing in health care is to remove pathogenic microorganisms (viruses) and prevent their spread.
A new medical journal reports that hand washing is unacceptable in most healthcare facilities, with many doctors and nurses forgetting to wash their hands before touching patients, which leads to the spread of microorganisms that spread disease.
Research shows that proper hand washing and other simple procedures can reduce catheter-related blood-borne infections by 66%, the World Health Organization (WHO) published a paper recommending balanced hand washing and hand-washing in health departments.
These rules of hygiene for the rabbit can be found on the Public Opinion section of the website.
Whitby et al. They conducted a relevant review.
Commercial devices may measure hand hygiene, where planning is required, consent is required.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has five moments of hand washing:
after contact with a blood or body fluid.
Before aseptic surgery, and
"after treatment of a patient. Adding a disinfectant to soap (soap "antibiotic" or "antibacterial") increases the disinfection power of hand sanitizer".
Such disinfection may be desired before surgery or in sets, in high-resistance cells, hand sanitizer for surgery, a pump that can be turned on and off without touching the hand, some chlorhexidine or detergent, sterile towels for hand drying after washing, sterile brushes for disinfection and some sterile tools for cleaning under the spit.
Remove all ornaments.
This procedure requires washing hands for at least 2 to 6 minutes.
Long-term (10-minute) sessions are not required.
When washing hands, do not allow water to run back and forth between the hands.
After the hand was washed, the hands were dried with a glass-free cloth and the hand was operated on.
To reduce the spread of the virus, it is advisable to wash hands or use a hand sanitizer before and after a patient's examination.
For the treatment of staphylococcal infections in hospitals, the overall benefit of handwashing was found to be 20% and the small additional benefit obtained when washing hands daily increased by more than 35%.
Routine washing with soap causes more than three times the effect of bacterial contamination on food compared to washing with disinfectant soap. Comparing hand-washing with disinfectant with hand-washing with disinfectant soap for 30 minutes each showed that alcohol-based alcohol reduced bacterial contamination by 26% more than disinfectant soap.
But soap and water are more effective than the alcohol-based anti-diarrheal agent for reducing H1N1 respiratory infection and diarrhea and clostridium defficile spores from the hand, Activities to improve hand hygiene in the healthcare system can improve education for workers on handwashing, and the availability of handwashing brushes and hand sanitizer labels and reminders for staff.
More research is needed, including identifying which are the most effective in different healthcare systems.
In developing countries, hand washing with soap is considered a simple, healthy way to stay healthy, and even a healthy diet.
Although the lack of safe drinking water, soap and handwashing equipment in homes, schools and workplaces has made it a challenge to achieve global handwashing standards.
For example in most rural areas of afirca public handwashing faucets near public toilets are scarce, although there are cheaper options for building handwashing stations.
Although the lack of laundry facilities may be the result of a culture rather than a lack of soap and water.
Providing advice on handwashing with soap may influence decisions, increase awareness of the importance of handwashing, and may even change people's behavior.
For this to work effectively, monitoring and evaluation are essential.
A review of 70 studies showed that community handwashing awareness approaches are more effective in increasing handwashing confidence in LMICs, while public marketing campaigns are less effective.An example for school handwashing awareness is the Three Star Approach proposed by UNICEF which encourages schools to take non-physical steps to ensure that students wash their hands with soap, along with other hygiene measures.
If the goal is achieved, schools can be placed in the final star category.
The construction of handwashing facilities may be a means of campaigning and promoting the reduction of childhood illness and death.
World Handwashing Day is another example of increased awareness trying to change behaviour.In response to the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic, UNICEF has promoted the use of handwashing emoji.
A few researchers have considered the impact of handwashing costs in developing countries, in relation to the DALY ban.
However, it has been suggested that promoting hand washing with soap is more effective than other water and sanitation.
The importance of hand washing for human health especially for people in critical situations such as mothers giving birth or soldiers who are injured in hospital was originated in the mid-19th Century by two pioneers of hand hygiene. the late Hugary Ignaz Semmelweis who worked in Vienna, Austria and Florence Nightingale, the pioneer of modern nursing.
At that time many believed that the disease was transmitted by a smell called miasmas.
In the 1980s, foodborne illness and the risk of infection from poor health care led the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to emphasize hand hygiene as a viable way to prevent the spread of disease.
The outbreak of foot and mouth disease in 2009 and the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 have led to awareness in many countries of the importance of hand washing with soap to protect against such diseases.
For example, a warning sheet with "best practices for hand washing" is hung near hand washing stations at public servants and at the airport's public works and airport rental areas in Germany.
"The phrase ""washing the hands of another"" something, means to define those who refuse to take responsibility for the thing or share in the suffering".
It originates from the Bible passage in Matthew, where Pontius Pilate washed his hands for the crucifixion of Jesus Christ, but they have become a phrase with widespread usage in the English-speaking world.
In Shakespeare's play Macbeth, Lady Macbeth begins to insist on washing her hands and the thought of wiping the stain from her mind, which shows her conscience murmuring over her crime and prompting her husband to act.
It has also been found that some people wash their hands more often than the general population after they have thought about doing something illegal, and they prefer to wash their hands with a washcloth rather than a washcloth.
In addition, those who were allowed to wash their hands after such ceremonial practices would perform a form of penitential cleansing, such as offering sacrifices.
Religions advise washing hands for hygiene and religious purposes. The use of water but not soap for hand washing is part of the ritual practice in many religions, including the Baha'i faith, Hinduism, Tevlah and netilat yadayim in Judaism, Lavado in Christianity, and wundu in Islam.
Hinduism, Judaism and Islam accept hand washing as a toilet.
Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, Judaism and Islam also have a mandate to wash their hands before or after each meal.
Monitoring workplace risks due to COVID-19
Workplace hazard monitoring from COVID-19 workplace safety and health practices to monitor hazards to protect people from infection with the COVID-19 coronavirus in 2019.
The appropriate risk assessment at the workplace depends on the workplace and workplace environment, based on the assessment of the risks associated with the site of infection, the severity of the disease in the community, and the risks associated with employees who may be infected with COVID-19.
According to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), the risk of exposure to small amounts of workplace contaminants is associated with the recommended prevention measures for infection, including hand washing, encouraging employees to stay home if they are unwell, respiratory claims, daily waste, cleaning and disinfection in the workplace.
Workers who are at high risk include those who require close contact with people who are not known or suspected to have COVID-19, but may be infected due to community-based transmission or travel abroad.
This includes public-sector employers such as schools, densely populated areas, and shopping malls.
Risk management for these groups, in addition to prevention measures, includes ventilation with a micro air filter, face masks and access to body products in case of COVID-19 infection.
OSHA considers healthcare workers and household workers who have been exposed to a known or suspected person with COVID-19 to be at high risk, which increases to a high risk of exposure if employees follow aerosol spraying policy, or collect or handle samples from, known or suspected person with COVID-19.
The hazard prevention that is appropriate for the workers is related to the Engineering elements such as the air pressure room, and the worker protection products that are appropriate for the job.
The COVID-19 pandemic can have many disruptions from the workplace.
Employees may be absent from work because of illness, to care for others, or out of fear of contracting disease.
Business processes can change, including in terms of the type of goods needed, and how the goods are supplied (such as overnight purchases or through drive-through services).
Finally, and the delivery of supplies to continents where COVID-19 is highly contagious may be interrupted.Preparation for the spread of the disease can be used as a response mechanism in the prevention workplace.
Good planning reduces the risks associated with workplaces and workplaces, including the location of infection, the risk factors from home and social situations, and occupational risk factors such as age or other serious health conditions.
They provide a timely warning system for the hazards, and a future plan for the behaviour that may result from the outbreak.
A communicable disease plan and response plan may be the subject of national or subnational recommendations.
The policies to access information on outbreaks include reducing the spread among workers, protecting the health of those considered to be most vulnerable, reforming business processes and reducing the impact of others on the system.
The disease has affected the business neighborhoods.
Hazard monitoring is a system used to assess whether occupational safety and health is a critical category of hazard.
Where the risk of COVID-19 cannot be eliminated, the best approach is engineering, followed by management, and finally, physical protection products.
Engineering compensation is based on the exclusion of workers from work-related hazards without relying on the characteristics of the workers, and would be a cost-effective solution implemented.
The supervisory board is changing the working conditions and organization that will require the employee's training.
Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) is considered to be a low-risk but effective measure to reduce the risk of infection, but it can also reduce the risk of infection.
All PPE must be selected before the accident to the worker, properly placed (Ms. respirator), when and how well, and checked regularly, and replaced and removed if caught, washed, and carefully sewn to allow the skin to spin.
According to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), the lowest exposure to workplace hazards is due to the low interaction of the employee with the public and other employees.
Basic prevention measures recommended for all workplaces include daily hand washing, encouraging workers to stay at home if they are sick, ventilation with a cough and wheezing cover, provision of a paper and garbage disposal, organizing work from home or reversing the dump if necessary, preventing workers from using tools and equipment of others, and maintaining hygiene to reduce infection and disruption of the work environment.
Rapid identification and isolation of infected persons is the most effective way to protect the health of employees, customers, visitors and those in their workplaces.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) advises employees with respiratory symptoms to stay home until they recover, if the fever symptoms persist for more than 24 hours with no battery left or symptoms untreated and sick leave is adequate, the employee should stay home and treat the patient as they are aware of the plans.
In the OSHA's view, those at higher risk include those who require close or direct contact within six feet (1.8 m) of people who are not identified or suspected to have COVID-19, but are at risk of contracting SARS-CoV-2 due to community transmission in commercial settings, or because someone has traveled abroad to a location where COVID-19 transmission has occurred.
These include employees who have a close interaction with the general public such as in schools, workplaces with a working environment where there is a high population density, and places where there is a high purchase. The engineering management for this and the hazard group includes the installation of improved air conditioning, increased number of ventilation devices, installation of physical barriers such as rubber protection devices, and installation of drive-through windows for customer service.
Workers in the emergency response team need to use ventilators.
If a person becomes ill on an aircraft, the proper measures to protect crew and other passengers include isolating the patient from others at a distance of 6 feet, designing one of the flight crew to serve the patient, and providing a mask to the patient or asking the patient to cover their mouth and nose with a paper towel while coughing or sneezing.
Seafarers should wear medical gloves when treating a sick passenger or exposure to bodily fluids or possible environmental contamination, and possibly additional protective equipment if the sick passenger has a fever, persistent cough, or difficulty breathing.
Handbags and other disposable items in the micro-hazard bag, face and body of infected objects should be cleaned and disinfected afterwards. For commercial transport, associated with cruise and other passenger flights, risk management includes delaying travel during illness, and alerting the health care center immediately if a person develops a fever or other symptoms while traveling.
The best practices and healthcare systems are in quarantine facilities.Schools and child care facilities, CDC recommends, should be closed to ensure that the facilities are cleaned even if the infection is found in school batteries and the spread of the disease in the neighborhood.
If there is a low prevalence of the virus in the community, there are measures to isolate such as restricting traffic, gatherings, even large gatherings such as a choir or choir class, or dining room, moving tables, and departure times, reducing non-essential visitors, and isolating a language section with flu symptoms.
When there is an outbreak in the home community, in addition to the distance, long school breaks may be included.For workers and those who have a regular job, the risk of infection is low, the CDC says.
Officials who must contact people who are infected or suspected of having COVID-19 are advised to follow emergency protocols of hospital staff, along with proper protective gear.
If contact occurs during the panic, employees should clean and clean their work equipment before re-use using a household sprayer or wiper, and follow the instructions for use for arrival and disposal of PPE used and washing of the equipment.
OSHA is looking into the possibility of a health department and staff at the mortuary to stand for the risk of infection.
The risk of exposure to human-induced infections is associated with healthcare workers, support, laboratory and transportation personnel who are exposed to an infected or suspected COVID-19 patient.
They are at greater risk if workers follow aerosol-generating techniques or respond to a test material from a suspected COVID-19 infection.
The theory of aerosol spraying is that aerosol generating pocedures include injection, coughing, and the effects of lung and other.
The most vulnerable are mortuary workers who process the remains of people known or suspected to be infected with COVID-19 at the time of death; these are particularly vulnerable when they test the remains.
A special ventilation system may be fitted in some health care facilities in the storage rooms.
All samples should be handled with Biosafety Level 3 precautions.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has recommended that new patients be isolated from other areas of the body, whether they are relatives or someone who has been infected with COVID-19. In addition to some PPE, OSHA has recommended the use of ventilators for those working between 6 and 10 feet for patients with known or suspected SARS-COV-2 infection, and those who are undergoing aerosol-generating procedures.
In the United States, NIOSH approved N95 for respiratory filters or even for effective use, a safety standard that includes careful testing, studies and clinical trials.
Some ventilators can provide better protection and improve the well-being of workers.The WHO does not approve the use of ventilators, as COVID-19 is a respiratory illness that is spread through body fluids.
WHO advised that medical masks are appropriate for checkpoints for point-of-entry.
For those receiving respiratory samples from, observing, or treating a COVID-19 patient without an aerosol-generating procedure, WHO advises that surgical face masks, eyeglasses, or face shields, a coat, and gloves are required.
If the aerosol-generating spraying technique is followed, it will replace the use of N95 medical masks or FFP2 respirators.
Given that the global supply of PPE is insufficient, WHO has recommended reducing the need for PPE by providing medication by contact, physical barriers such as an open mask, allowing those involved in care to directly enter the room where the COVID-19 infected person is, using PPE only for specific tasks, continuing to use the usual ventilator without removing it while treating multiple patients with the same disease, monitoring and regulating the availability of PPE, and prohibiting the use of masks for people with symptoms of the disease.

COVID-19: Reducing costs and preparing for the future
The date and time of the event: March 14, 2020, 00:24 UTC
Licensed by: CC0: No rights reserved
We found ourselves in a unique situation that month.
The COVID-19 pandemic is another manifestation of our global relationships and the burden it places on each of us.
We are not favored because of the challenge, but we hate that our response depends on the compassion, cooperation and community building that resides at the heart of the Organization.
The mutual attention we have seen in all our colleagues over emails, calls, and chats is another proof of the positive people we are very fortunate to work with.
I will not fail to put you among my fellow workers.
Last week, someone expressed his appreciation for our work
They reminded me that the world could have replaced Wikipedia, which is now a toxic testing champion, by being open and accessible to everyone.
Your work makes this possible, whether you keep the sites up or our paid partners or from our community's reserves.
The world needs the information that Wikipedia provides, more than ever.
It will be a time when not what we do but how we do it will have a profound effect on the earth.
Due to the use of mqnufqr and the nature of your role we will be making some changes to our work schedule starting next week.
Balancing our work and schedule
As Robyn said, the c-team met last night to discuss approaching us and planning for the coming days and months.
In this regard, we have considered what we think would be the answer to what we are facing and the best way to keep the organization fit for the time being.
We want to remove the stress and support our long-term goals.
If you want to make more calls, here it is.
For all employees, contractors and employees
Our daily work schedule will be about 4 hours a day, or 20 hours a week until further notice.
We don't give breaks - if you can work hard during normal hours, the organization can work you.
However, the world cannot be predicted now, and whether we are observing loved ones, buying soups, or seeing a doctor, your health is our priority.
We don't keep up with your schedule
If you are sick, do not work
This is not a wordless mistake, but we are dealing with it.
There is no sick date or need for the PTO to tell your manager with the help of reviewing your organization's calendar and a system of confirming important work schedules.
(If you have tested positive for COVID-19, Bryan's grave in T&amp;C Ops will be so T&amp;C will help ensure that the case receives proper care.)
The People of the Hour will be fully rewarded.
We have already said, and we respect all our sacrifices in delivering our contracts to our temporary co-workers.
Each would be paid according to the amount of time worked.
This includes when you are sick and unable to work.
If you will work, we will support you.
Many people are obsessed with work as a way to spread their problems around us.
What we do can be very rewarding, especially at such times.
The same is true of caring for your own
Our job is to talk to your manager, find out what we need and how we can adjust.
Some activities are essential.
There are other things we need to keep doing.
SRE, HR Ops, Trust and Trust, and Fundraising Teams (among others) are doing a critical job that needs additional support.
We will start implementing the whole section to determine the current policy and shift focus on supporting what is important in our work.
There is still much work to do, but we will focus on the important ones.
A lack of confidence now will not hurt in the future.
I plan to travel twice in order to achieve the goal once the pandemic is over.
You may not want to work overtime because it is not possible to finish the job at the right time.
We accept changing circumstances, and we will work to produce new plans when appropriate.
What happened to the APP (Annual Plan)?
To be able to adapt to the current situation and our daily routines, we are considering changing the timing to achieve our 2020-2021 agenda.
Our intention is to further extend our 2019-2020 schedule which will allow more budget time to allow employees to focus on essential tasks, self-care, and caring for loved ones while leaving those who need or want to work on a reduced schedule in the coming weeks.
This additional time further eases the programming workload and pressure across the organization.
We will be moving our schedule to our intersection next week with new officers and team on our next schedule for confirmation.
Thank you to the APP team for your leadership in this.
Office space, safety, and cleaning
Last week we learned that one of SF-BASED's employees was infected with COVID-19.
Yet, in a great deal of care, we found a team of disinfectors to clean the entire surface of our San Francisco office.
Wipe or wipe with disinfectant to prevent the spread of infection in the area, including roads and the corners of the floor.
The building is experiencing a new phase of quality management and monitoring system to ensure the safety of its people.
We were happy to have the office ready for our next visit.
Our DC office at WeWork, which has announced the COVID-19 system is concerned about any DC-BASED employees
Last week, our DC Office became a full-fledged site with security data from San Francisco.
As some of our colleagues living in NYC know, we are in talks about offering a location in Brooklyn.
These discussions are continued but he is slow to respond.
Some of our employees are working remotely for the first time.
Our remote-working friends knew that it could be a bit of a balancing act, and they were willing to offer suggestions.
Cut back on the time you spend with them to one or two hours at a time.
If longer periods are needed, plan how to distribute them over the next several days.
Plan the meeting carefully, find out the purpose of the meeting, and send reading materials.
You upload real-time video, and tools like Google Docs and Zoom to facilitate networking and instant communication over the internet.
One to lead the facilitation of each meeting, one to monitor the discussion for questions and track the list of speakers, and another to help take notes (or collaborate take-notes).
Send an email to tech support if you need a comfortable headset.
Use your health-promoting ingredients as snacks.
Join the #remoties channel on Slack to chat with co-workers about sharing work.
HR Services is seeking leadership in the ergonomics building foundation to support the increased distribution of work across the Foundation.
We asked all communities last week to give the legacy and to drop Wikimedia funding to the public, such as editathons, until the WHO declares the pandemic over.
We announced that we understand our demands to suspend certain restrictions would make the conclusion of their financial agreements difficult and that no one would be penalized for delaying or revising policies.
We will follow up further guidelines next week on Wikimedia and other regional and national events as usual.
The general reaction from the international community has been to portray the session as sad and disastrous but the positive feedback and the focus on the community, Wikimedia and otherwise.
Further, CRT is working on creating a META-WIKI page to provide a space for the public to observe and keep track of all our information and theirs.
Stay up to date on all COVID-19 related issues
We will send you a calendar invitation on the following Thursday, 14:00 UTC/07:00 PT for a special meeting for our staff.
We would use that time to share more updates, answer questions, and spend a little time getting to know each other.
We are in this together and are here to help in any way we can.
For the time being, you can access my information via this email, and the corresponding COVID-19 information site on Office Wiki,
The CRT stores the pages and all the data in one place.
We work to keep in touch with employees who live in the countries currently affected.
If you have any questions about travel, or any business, or any job, or filling a vacancy or anything else then you need help please let us know and give CRT support.
We are here to offer help and support when needed.
If you have any important or urgent matters, please send an email to Bryan Judan - HR Director International Global Operations.
These changes should not be viewed as a complete resignation.
Rather, they point out that at this time, our work and our motives may need to be adjusted in a way that we have not done before.
These are the steps we see as essential to support each other in order to keep the work going, provide our organization with the support they need, and the work the world depends on.
Our work schedule is here and waiting for us when the time is right.
Now is the time to take care of one another and to prepare for the important work that lies ahead in the weeks and perhaps months ahead.
We need your support in making this possible, so we want you to take care of yourself and your family so that we can be of assistance if the need arises.
Now, please - wash your hands and do not touch your face!
Katherine, she is the CRT (Amanda K, Amy V, Bryan J, Doreen D, Gregory V, Jaime V, Joel L, Lynette L, Ryan M, and Tony S), along with the other directors (Grant I, Heather W, Jaime V, Janeen U, Lisa S, Robyn A, Ryan M, and Toby N).
Conversion bAngiotensin enzyme 2 (ACE2) is an enzyme that is attached to the surface (cell membranes) of cells in the lungs, arteries, heart, kidneys, and intestines.
ACE2 regulates the activity of the enzyme-linked receptor (ACE) by reducing the concentration of angiotensin-II and increasing Ang (1-7) making it an important target for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases. ACE2 also acts as a cell-entry pathway for some coronaviruses.
The human version of the enzyme is called hACE2.
The active enzyme of angiotensin 2 is the zinc-containing ironloenzyme which is present on the endothelial surface and other cells.
The protein ACE2 is composed of the N-terminal peptidase M2 domain and the C-terminal collectrin renal amino acid transport domain.
ACE2 is a type of transition membrane protein, with an enzymatically active region that exposes the cell surface in the lungs and other tissues.
The extracellular region of ACE2 is initiated from the viral area by an enzyme known as a blood-flow, and the resulting digestible protein is excreted into the bloodstream and eventually deposited in the urine.
ACE2 is present in most tissues: ACE2 binds to the skin of most lung type II alveolar cells, enterocytes of the small intestine, nerve and cardiac nerve cells and smooth muscle cells in most tissues.
ACE2 MRNA signals can be found in the cerebral cortex, the straitum hypotamalamus and the briainstem.
The primary function of ACE2 is to act as a balancing factor for ACE.
ACE is contracted by angiotensin I hormone into vasoconstricting angiotensin II.
ACE2 in turn binds to the carboxyl-terminal amino acid phenylalanine from angiotensin II (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe) and hydrolyses it into the vasodilator angiotensin (1-7), (H-Asp-Arg -Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-OH).
ACE2 can also degrade certain peptides including [des-Arg9] -bradykinin, apelin, neurotensin, dynorphin A, and ghrelin.
ACE2 also regulates the membrane transport of the neutral transporter amino acid SLC6A19 and is associated with Hartnup syndrome.
As a transmembrane protein, ACE2 acts as a major entry point into the cell (cell) for certain coronaviruses, including HCoV-NL63; SARS-CoV (the virus that causes SARS); and SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19).
The combination of the protein spike s1 of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 do bind the patient to ACE2 at the cell base which in turn causes endocytosis and translocation of the disease and also the virus to be released into the endosome which is in the cells.
The pathway of the receptor is associated with all the priming mechanisms of the S protein derived from the serine protease TMPRSS2, and the formation of the investigational protein is considered a major thrapeutic factor. This leads to a decrease in the predicted level of ACE2, in cells, which may help fight the disease.
Despite their high population of insects, many require the development of ACE inhibitor alternative ARB therapy.
which review published on July 11 of 2012 which found ACE inhibitors associated with a 34% reduction in colds compared to mice.
The risk of cold is given to patients who have been at risk of stroke or death from heart or kidney disease.
The use of ACE inhibitors has also been associated with a reduced mortality rate of pneumonia, although the results obtained are not significant other than the risk of pneumonia.
Recombination human ACE2 (rhACE2) is thought to be a treatment for acute pneumonia, manifested by improved lung function and oxygenation in the small intestine and triggered lipopolysaccharide infections that cause severe respiratory symptoms.
The half-life of RHACE2 in humans is 10 hours and 30 seconds including 24 hours of additional activity.
Several studies have suggested that rhACE2 may be a drug that is not tolerant to renin-angiotensin system inhibitors (RAS inhibitors) or in diseases with high anglotensin II cycles.
"b'COVID-19 are mobile software applications designed to assist in contact tracing in response to the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic, i.e. the process of identifying people (""contacts"") who may have been in contact with an infected person".
access opportunities were sought or obtained, but government support in some areas with a clear population.
Several procedures to identify the perpetrators were ignored.
Privacy concerns have been raised, particularly regarding the procedures related to tracking the locations of the countries using the database.
A small KAFAR uses air to access the campsite with mobile phones.
On 10 April 2020, Google and Apple announced that they would merge functions to support such Bluetooth-based applications directly in their Android and iOS operating systems.
In China, the government, in collaboration with Alipay, has deployed a system that allows citizens to check if they have been in contact with people who have been infected with COVID-19.
It is used in over 200 Chinese cities. In Singapore, an app called TraceTogether is used.
"The manager was developed by the local IT community, released as open source and will be handed over to the government.North Macedonia has launched ""StopKorona!"", a Bluetooth manager to detect the risk from people infected with the virus and report back to health authorities".
The app was developed by the Ministry of Communications and Technology and the Ministry of Health.
As of 14 April 2020, the app is awaiting approval from the Google Play Store and Apple App Store.
On 12 April the government banned the use of the app by the internal supporting platform and it was due to be released in a similar week to the app called in Ireland and France Stopcovid.
Both Australia and New Zealand are considering applications based on Singapore's TraceTogether app and BlueTrace protocol.Russia intends to introduce a larger version of the tool for patients diagnosed with COVID-19 living in Moscow, designed to ensure that they do not leave home.
Ross Anderson, professor of security engineering at the University of Cambridge, lists some potential problems with implementing cyber-attack schemes, including fake claims and potential inefficiencies if the adoption of the tool is limited to a small community.
Addressing concerns about the spread of the coronavirus app, Apple has set limits on the type of devices an organization can put a coronavirus-related person in the app store, limiting them to only jōoi or other known organizations.
Google and amazon have implemented similar restrictions.
Privacy advocates have expressed concern about the impact of public surveillance using coronavirus tools, particularly about whether surveillance tools created to combat the Coronavirus pandemic will be abandoned once the threat has passed.
Amnesty International and more than 100 other human rights organizations have issued a statement calling for a reduction in this form of surveillance.
The groups identified eight conditions for public services:
The monitoring activities must be legally binding, then necessary, and proportionate.
budding or caring for the bibini can find the west.
the use of data is compulsory for COVID-19 purposes;
The confidentiality of information and the transaction must be maintained and demonstrated to be maintained for the purposes;
Digital monitoring of patients must be avoided by discrimination and segregation.
any exchange of information with third parties must be legally defined;
There is protection from abuse and the right of citizens to respond to abuse;
Participation in the interview, which is open to all participants, was requested by several healthcare professionals and interest groups, including the German CCC and RSF's Reporter ohne Grenzen.
The proposed Google/Apple protocol aims to solve the problem of continuous tracking by removing the tracking feature from their device operating system as long as it is no longer needed.
Some countries have adopted location tracking instead of software which provides the benefits of downloading the app and protecting location tracking.
In Israel, the surveillance of communications is permitted.
Network solutions that have access to geographic information resources are also important to highlight privacy concerns.
However, not all systems with central servers require access to private data locations; many privacy policies have been created that use only central servers for communication (see section below).
In South Korea it is a non-software device used to detect the presence of a virus.
Instead of using a proprietary tracking system (app), the system collects tracking data from multiple sources including phone records and card transaction data, and combines these to generate notifications via text messages to infected people.
In addition to using this information to alert contacts, the government also made location information public, something that was allowed due to the many changes to privacy laws following the MERS outbreak in that country.
This information is made public through some applications and websites.The accounts that include Germany are processed using a strict and confidential system.
As of 6 April 2020, no information has been released yet.
Privacy-based contact identification is a well-established process, with a well-established body of research manuals that date back to at least 2013.As of 7 April 2020, over a dozen experts are working on privacy solutions, such as using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) to pinpoint proximity to the user of other mobile phones.
However, PEPP-PT is a collaborative effort that includes both centralized and flexible methods, not a single protocol.The standards offered include Data Privacy (DP-PPT/DP-3T), Real-Time Local Numbers (TCN, fka contact number function, CEN), Privacy and Procedural Framework for Telecommunications Tracking (PACT) and others.

A new trial of peppers in Australia Calls for the involvement of 4,170 health workers
The vaccine may not be safe or effective in the long run.
Early studies to achieve efficacy using COVID-19-specific systems in animals, such as ACE2-transgenic rats, as well as in other laboratory animals and non-human origin, have highlighted the need to evaluate three levels of biosafety measures - biosafety-level 3 for live virus handling, and global consistency to ensure a healthy system.
Vaccines against SARS and MERS have been developed in animal models of humans.
As of 2020, there is no cure or vaccine against SARS that has been shown to be safe and effective in humans.
According to research papers published in 2005 and 2006, the discovery and development of vaccines and drugs to treat SARS has been a priority for governments and public health authorities worldwide.
When MERS became widespread, it was believed that the existing SARS test could provide a useful model for the development of immunization and treatment against MERS-CoV infection.
As of March 2020, there are two (DNA-based) MERS vaccines that have completed Phase I clinical trials in humans, and three others in development, all of which are viral vector-borne vaccines, two adenoviral-vectored (ChAdOx1-MERS, BVRS-GamVac), and one MVA-vectored (MVA-MERS-S).
Social media posts have promoted a speculative theory that the virus that causes COVID-19 is known and a vaccine has already been developed.
The citations published by various social media platforms cite existing information about the genetic and vaccine sequences of certain coronavirus such as SARS coronavirus.
The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a disease that is caused by the highly contagious and highly contagious coronavirus disease 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Common symptoms include fever, cough, and difficulty breathing.
Other symptoms may include fatigue, muscle aches, diarrhea, sore throat, bad breath, and stomach pain.
The incubation period for symptoms is about five days but can vary from two to fourteen days.
While most cases result in mild symptoms, some progress to pneumonia and multiple cell deaths.
As of 17 April 2020, more than two million (2.24) new cases have been reported from 210 countries, resulting in more than 153 million deaths.
More than 568,000 were cured.* The disease is spread among people through close contact, usually by small droplets coming through coughing, sneezing, or talking.
As the parasites emerge during respiration, most of them fall to the ground or to the surface rather than remain contagious from a distance.
People can contract the disease by touching contaminated surfaces and then touching their eyes, nose, or mouth.
The virus can survive on the surface for up to 72 hours.
It is most prevalent in the first three days of symptoms, although it can spread before symptoms appear later.The main diagnostic method is real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) from nasopharyngeal swab.
The use of masks was recommended for those suspected of having the disease, along with their caregivers.
Recommendations for the use of face masks and public protection vary, with some authorities recommending avoiding their use, some recommending their use, and others requiring their use.
Currently, there is no vaccine or specific treatment for COVID-19.
Domestic transmission has been recorded in most countries surrounding the six WHO regions.
Those infected with the virus may be symptomatic or develop flu-like symptoms such as fever, cough, fatigue, and shortness of breath.
Emergency symptoms include difficulty breathing, chest pain or pressure, confusion, difficulty getting up, and facial or tongue swelling; immediate medical attention is recommended if these symptoms are observed.
Sometimes, respiratory symptoms such as wheezing, runny nose or dry throat appear.
Gastrointestinal disorders such as heartburn, vomiting, and diarrhea are observed in varying degrees.
Some cases of congestive heart failure and sudden cardiac arrest have been found in China.
In others, the disease may progress to limonia, limb dysfunction and death.
This is called the reproductive cycle.
The incubation period of COVID-19 is usually five to six days but can last from two to 14 days.
97.5% of people who show symptoms do so within eleven and a half (11.5) days of infection. Rohoto pointed out that not all infected individuals show symptoms.
The role of these unidentified carriers in the transmission is not yet known; however, some witnesses have indicated that they may be contagious.
The estimated proportion of people who do not show symptoms of infection is currently unknown, but research is ongoing.The Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) reports that 20% of all confirmed cases of infection do not show symptoms during their stay in hospital.
The Chinese Health Administration first included symptomatic cases in the daily infection count on 1 April; of the 166 cases on that day, 130 (78%) were symptomatic at the time of testing.
Even today mosquitoes can carry a wide range of viruses.
Speaking out loud allows for a greater degree of expression than normal speech.
A study in Singapore revealed that a cough can cause a fall of 4.5 meters (15 feet).
Although the virus does not follow the airborne pathway, the National Academy of Science suggests that bioaerosol transmission may occur when air collectors are placed on the surface of the outside, near human environments where a positive RNA sample is obtained.
Some medical procedures such as cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) can cause air pollution which can lead to air pollution.
While there is concern that it can be spread through the toilet, this risk is believed to be slightly lower. The virus is more transmissible as people are exposed, while transmission is possible before symptoms appear, the risk is slightly lower.
The European Centre for Disease Control (ECDC) says that while it is not fully understood how easily the virus is spread, one person infects two to three.The virus lives for hours to days on a surface.
In particular, the virus has been detected for one day on cardboard, up to three days on plastic (polypropylene) and iron (AISI 304), and up to four hours on 99% copper.
However, this varies according to temperature and humidity.
Soap is helpful when used properly; the soap product absorbs the infection and clears it from the skin and other surfaces.
Other solutions such as benzalkonium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate, were less effective. In a Hong Kong study, a mouth sample was taken for two days after initial clinical treatment.
In five out of six patients, the first sample showed the highest prevalence of the disease, and the sixth patient showed the highest prevalence of the disease on the second day of the test.
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2) acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, three cases of pneumonia related to the cluster and respiratory syndrome were first isolated in Wuhan.
All novel variants of SARS-CoV-2 occur in the coronavirus in nature.
Outside the body, the infection is killed by local soap which breaks down its resistance. SARS-CoV-2 is the most similar to the original SARS-CoV.
Pigs are most vulnerable to COVID-19 because the virus is able to enter the cells through the enzyme angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is most abundant in type II alveolar cells of the lungs.
The virus uses a special glycoprotein called a peplomer to bind to ACE2 to enter the host cell.
Heart failure was diagnosed in 12% of those hospitalized in Wuhan, China, and was more common in severe cases.
The incidence of heart attacks is particularly high, due to inflammatory and immune system problems as the disease progresses, but the known heart attack is associated with ACE2 receptors in the heart.
ACE2 receptors are highly expressed in the heart and stimulate the activity of the heart muscle.
A significant risk of thrombosis (31%) and venous thromboembolism (25%) was observed in ICU patients with COVID-19 and may be associated with a more severe progression.Both people who died from COVID-19 also had a degenerative disease of the lungs (DAD), and lymphocyte-induced inflammation entering the lungs.
Although SARS-COV-2 has a mutation in the ACE2-expressing cells of the respiratory tract, patients with COVID-19 have symptoms of severe inflammation.
In simpler terms, it has been shown that GM-CSF-secreting T-cells are associated with inflammation of IL-6-secreting monocytes and pneumonia in COVID-19 patients.
Lymphocytic cells were detected in the testes.
WHO has published several diagnostic strategies for the disease.
The test method is a direct-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR).
The test is based on a respiratory sample obtained from a nasopharyngeal test, however, a sample taken from the nose and mouth may be used.
Test results are available between two hours and two days.
A blood test may be used, but this requires two blood samples taken two weeks earlier and the results are not immediately conclusive.
Chinese scientists have been able to isolate the coronavirus strain and the newly synthesized genetic sequence and laboratories around the world can develop polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests to detect the virus infection.
As of 4 April 2020, viral testing (which can detect active infection and whether a person has had previous infection) is underway, but has not yet been widely used.
According to Chinese estimates on testing, the accuracy is only 60 to 70 percent.
The FDA in the US approved the first case of treatment on 21 March 2020 for use later that month.The diagnostic guidelines from Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University recommend diagnostic methods based on clinical features and viral risk.
Multilubar, glass-bottom opacitiea combination with area asymmetry and forward distribution are common in early infection.
Subpleural invasion, manic-depressive disorder, and hypertension may occur as the disease progresses.
There is little information on COVID-19.
The main findings from the study of the cattle were:
Macroscopy: plerisy, pericarditis, pulmonary edema and pulmonary edema are also common.
There are four main symptoms of pneumonia:
moderate pneumonia: pulmonary edema, pneumocyte hyperplasia, large atypical pneumocytes, interstitial and lymphocytic tumors and the occurrence of a large multinucleated cell.
acute pneumonia: Distribution of alveolar damage (DAD) and distribution of alveolar exudate.
DAD is the most common cause of respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and severe hypoxemia.
cured by namonia: groups of exudates in the alveolar cavities and pulmonary interstitial fibrosis.
Blood: disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC); leukoerythroblastic reaction
Prevention measures to reduce the risk of infection include staying at home, avoiding crowded places, washing hands frequently with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, using a respiratory hygiene system and avoiding touching eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands.
The CDC recommends covering the mouth and nose with toilet paper during coughing or sneezing and recommends using a hand wash if toilet paper is not available.
Hand washing after each cough or sneezing is recommended.
The CDC recommends the use of face masks in public places, in part to limit transmission from an infected person to a symptomatic person.The social distancing policy is intended to reduce contact with an infected person and large crowds by closing schools and workplaces and restricting travel and cancelling large public gatherings.
The rules of distance involved people giving a rope at least 6 feet (1.8 m) apart.
"There is no known cure for COVID-19.Like vaccines, it is not expected until early 2021, a key part of COVID-19 management is to try to reduce the spread of the epidemic, known as ""flattening the curve"".
The CDC recommends that people wash their hands frequently with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the bathroom or hands are obviously dirty, before eating or after blowing their nose, coughing or sneezing.
It also recommends using handwashing with 60% disinfectant, but only when soap and water are not available, and in areas that lack access to handwashing detergent.
In these processes, the active agent in the microbe is an alcohol, such as ethanol or isopropanol.
Hydrogen peroxide is used to remove bacterial holes in alcohol; it is ineffective for hand sanitization.
Glycerol is added as a humectant.
Patients are treated with supportive care, which may include fluids, respirators and support for other affected organs.
The CDC has recommended that those suspected of carrying the virus should wear a mask.
Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) has been used to help patients with cardiac arrhythmias due to respiratory failure, but its effectiveness has not been proven.
Personal hygiene and a healthy lifestyle and diet are recommended to boost the immune system.
Support is useful in those with mild treatment at the onset of infection WHO and the Chinese National Health Service have published recommendations for the hospitalization of patients with COVID-19 infection.
Intensivists and pulmonologists in the U.S. offer treatments from various agencies, the IBCC.
As of April 2020 there is no specific vaccine for the COVID-19 virus.
For example, some medical experts recommend starting with paracetamol over ibuprofen.
Precautions must be taken to reduce the spread of the virus, especially in healthcare settings as jobs that can produce aerosols such as hand ventilators, or ventilators, are suspected.
Healthcare providers caring for people with COVID-19, CDC recommends placing the person in an AIIR, a segregated room with surveillance, contact and ventilation. CDC has defined guidelines for the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) during the visit.
The recommended bodywear are: PPE, respirators or face masks, eye protection, and gloves. When available, respirators (rather than face masks) are preferred.
N95 respirators are permitted for manufacturing facilities but the FDA has authorized face mask protection under the Emergency Use Authorization (EUA).
They are designed to protect objects from airborne particles such as dust but are effective against a specific biological agent that is not responsible for taking medication without a medical prescription.
When no restrictions are in place, the CDC recommends the use of face masks or similar home-made restrictions.
The COVID-19 virus is not severe enough to require ventilation or alternative, but is sometimes found.
A form of respiratory support for people with COVID-19 infection is being studied for people with respiratory problems in hospitals, with some evidence suggesting that intabalation can be prevented with nasal decongestants or airway pressure.
It is not known whether either of these two can provide any similar benefit to people suffering from chronic illnesses.
Some doctors prefer invasive ventilation when it is performed because this system shortens the dispersion of aerosol substances, compared to passing the nasal cannula.
Many developing countries lack adequate hospital beds or facilities, which has limited the capacity of the health system to handle the increasing number of severe COVID-19 cases that require hospital beds.
One study in China found that five percent (5%) were admitted to intensive care units, 2.3% needed assistance with ventilation, and 1.4% died.
In China, about 30% of people hospitalized with COVID-19 are admitted to the ICU.
Airflow is becoming more complicated as respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) develops in COVID-19 and oxygenation becomes more difficult.
Ventilators with a pressure-controlled airway and PEEP are needed to increase ventilation capacity, while reducing the risk of pneumothorax-related infections.
PEEP is not available in an old ventilator.
Research on therapies began in January 2020, and several anti-infectious drugs are being tested.
Remdesivir appears to be the most effective.
Although new drugs may take until 2021 to be developed, most of the drugs being tested have already been approved for use or are in future trials.
Antibiotics may be tested in people with severe illnesses.
WHO advised volunteers to engage in clinical trials of the efficacy, efficacy and safety of potential treatment.The FDA has granted provisional approval for convalescent plasma as a single life-threatening trial.
The clinical trials needed to prove its efficacy and usefulness in treating the disease have not yet been conducted.
In February 2020 China launched a mobile app to combat the outbreak.
Users are required to enter their name and ID number.
The app identifies nearby people and uses tracking data, thus increasing the risk of infection.
Each user can check the status of three users.
If a potential risk is identified, not the isolation recommended by the app, it can alert local health officials.Big data analysis on phone records, facial recognition technology, phone tracking and artificial intelligence are used to identify infected individuals, and people who have made contact in South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore.
In March 2020 the Israeli government allowed security agencies to track the mobile phone data of people infected with the coronavirus.
Measures have been taken to ensure quarantine to protect those who come into contact with an infected person.
And in March 2020, Deutsche Telekom shared telephone and data locations with the German federal government agency, the Robert Koch Institute, to explore ways to combat the spread of the virus.
Russia has deployed facial recognition technology to identify violators of the quarantine rule.
Italy's health commissioner, Giulio Gallera, said mobile phone operators had informed him that 40 percent of people were developing dementia.
The German government organized a 48-week holiday with over 42,000 convention participants.
Also the president of Estonia, Kersti Kaljulaid has called on the world to find solutions, against the spread of the coronavirus.
People may have problems because of quarantine, travel restrictions, medical risks, or fear of contracting a disease.
"The BBC quoted Rory O'Connor as saying, ""Increasing social isolation, loneliness, ill health, fatigue and economic collapse are the perfect storm to damage people's mental health and public health"."
The disease can be easily transmitted with few or no symptoms, such as a chronic bronchitis, or a common cold.
Symptoms usually resolve within two weeks, while symptoms may take three to six weeks to resolve.
Pregnant women may be at higher risk for infection with COVID-19 based on data from other similar viruses, such as SARS and MERS, but data for COVID-19 are scarce.
In those who are most affected, COVID-19 can rapidly progress to acute respiratory syndrome syndrome syndrome syndrome (ARDS) which causes respiratory failure, septic shock or multiple organ failure.
COVID-19-related complications include sepsis, abnormal blood clotting and heart, even liver damage.
Blood clotting problems, especially increased periods of cold.It was reported that in six (6%) of those hospitalized with COVID-19, moderate kidney disease was only four (4%) of this group.
About 20-30% of people who have COVID-19 show elevated liver enzymes (Transaminases).
According to one report, the time between the onset of symptoms and death was ten days, with five days spent in hospital.
However, patients referred to the ICU have a seven-day window between being admitted to the hospital and dying.
In early studies, the interval from the first symptoms to death was 14 days, with a total range of six to 41 days.
In a study by the National Health Commission (NHC) of China, men had a mortality rate of 2.8% compared to 1.7% for women.
Histopathological analysis of the lung samples of the male showed damage to the alveola and fibromyxoid cells that originated from both lungs.
The virus has also been observed in pneumocyte changes.
The pulmonary imaging is similar to acute respiratory syndrome syndrome (ARDS).
In 11.8% of deaths reported by the national health agency, cardiac damage was observed by elevated troponin levels or cardiac arrest.
According to March data from the US, 89% of hospitalized patients have this condition.
Estimates of mortality from this condition vary due to differences between regions and management difficulties.
Failure to count new infections could lead to a much higher death toll and could be overwhelming.
However, the fact that death is the result of past illness may indicate that the current death toll is being overlooked.
Smokers were 1.4 times more likely to develop severe COVID-19 infection and about 2.4 times more likely to require intensive care or death compared to nonsmokers, concerns have been expressed about long-term sequelae of the disease.
The Hong Kong Hospital found a 20% to 30% decrease in lung capacity in some who recovered from the infection, and the lung tests showed damage to human body.
This may cause further problems after the healing.
As of March 2020, it was not yet known whether those infected with the virus had recovered, or had long-term immunity to the disease.
A hostage was found, based on the characteristics of some coronavirus, but there were cases of positive cases and those who recovered from COVID-19 were released for positive testing for coronavirus at a later time reported.
These concerns are seen as promoting infection rather than re-infection.
The virus is thought to be natural and originated in animals, through infection.
The exact origin is unknown, but as of December 2019 the prevalence of infection has almost surpassed human-to-human transmission.
A review of 41 COVID-19 cases, published in January 2020 in the Lancet, showed that the first day of symptoms was 1 December 2019.
The World Health Organization announced that the first symptoms of the disease appeared on December 8, 2019.
Many procedures are used to ease the process of dying
These figures vary by region and are influenced by the size of the trial over time, the quality of the healthcare system, treatment options, time since the outbreak and demographic factors such as age, sex and overall health.
At the end of 2019, WHO declared an emergency ICD-10 number U07.1 for deaths from laboratory exposure to SARS-CoV-2 infection and U07.2 for deaths from clinical or epidemiologically confirmed COVID-19 infection not confirmed by laboratory exposure to SARS-CoV-2.
According to Johns Hopkins University statistics the global death rate was 6.9% (153, 822/2, 240,191) as of 17 April 2020.
The numbers vary by region, other measures include the fertility rate (CFR) which indicates the number of people, (tested and untested) who have died from the disease.
These statistics are short-term and follow a specific population from infection through curative treatment.
Although not all people have an immune system that fights off disease, the presence of chemicals may provide an explanation for how many people are infected.
In the outbreak in Italy, Castiglione d'Adda, a small village of 4,600, 80 (1.7%) had already died.
In Genglet, the disease is spread during the Carnival celebrations, and the spread to young people is the simplest cause of death and not all deaths for COVID-19 are categorized by type.
And the German health system was not overcome.
In the Netherlands, about 3 percent have a pathogen, as determined by blood donors.
69 people (0.004% of the population) have been confirmed to have died from COVID-19 virus.
The effects of disease and the death rate vary between men and women.
A study in China and Italy found that men die more often than women
The greatest risk of infection is among men aged 50 and over, with a difference between men and women of only about 90%.
In China the mortality rate was 2.8 percent for men and 1.7 percent for women.
it is not known why there is a difference between men and women but drugs and behavioral factors may be a factor.
The immune system differences between men and women, the low smoking rate among women and the higher blood pressure among men have increased the mortality rate among men.
In Europe, 57% of cases are male, and 72% of deaths from COVID-19 are male.
As of April 2020 the US government does not segregate male or female COVID-19 patients.
Studies show that infections from viral diseases such as Ebola, HIV, influenza and SARS affect men and women at different times.
The majority of healthcare workers are women, and they are at high risk of contracting the virus.
"The World Health Organization announced on February 11, 2020 that the name of the disease will be officially ""COVID-19""".
WHO President Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus explained that CO stands for corona, VI for virus, D for disease, and 19 for when the virus was first identified: 31 December 2019.
The name was chosen to avoid the idea of extending to a specific geographic area (e.g., China), animal species or humans, in accordance with the naming convention that seeks to eliminate discrimination.The virus that causes COVID-19 is named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
The World Health Organization uses the COVID-19 virus and the virus that causes COVID-19 in social networks.
Both the virus and the virus are known as coronavirus
During the initial outbreak in Wuhan China, the virus-borne disease was commonly referred to as the coronavirus and Wuhan coronavirus.
In January 2020, the World Health Organization recommended 2019-nCoV and 2019-nCoV, commonly known as respiratory illness as the temporary names for the virus and the disease according to the 2015 guidelines on the use of sites in viral and viral strains.
The names COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 were given on 11 February 2020.
Due to the limited capacity in the rich format, some digital manufacturers are printing Medical products such as nasal sprays and ventilation units.
For example, when a hospital in Italy needed an emergency ventilator, and we were not available at the time, a domestic rotary machine produced 100 valves needed for the night.
After the outbreak of COVID-19, conspiracy theories, false stories emerged on the origin, scale, prevention and other aspects of the virus that spread quickly on the internet.
Humans can transmit disease to other animals.
The study failed to find any positive virus in pigs, chickens and chickens.
There is no approved drug or vaccine for treating this disease.
International investigations into COVID-19 are being conducted by government agencies, and the Scientific and Industrial Research Council.
In March, the World Health Organization launched a trial, the SOLIDARITY Trial to find four vaccines that are thought to be effective.
No vaccine is available, but various agencies are working to find it.
The previous work on SARS-CoV is being used because SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 both use ACE2 to enter the human body.
There are three basic ways to find out.
Initially, researchers aimed to develop a vaccine against the virus.
The use of such a virus, whether harmless or dead, seeks emergency protection in the human body against a new COVID-19 infection.
The second approach, the vaccine approach, is to find a vaccine that can help fight off other forms of the disease.
In the case of SARS-CoV-2, similar studies focus on the S-Spike enzyme which helps the virus to penetrate the ACE2 enzyme.
The third method is nucleic acid antibiotics (DNA or RNA antibiotics, new methods of creating antibiotics).
Vaccines from each were to be tested for safety and efficacy on March 16, 2020, the first Trawan vaccine company with four volunteers in Seattle.
The vaccine contains a harmless genetic code that is copied from the virus that causes the disease.Anti-viral agents have been suggested as a way to produce a vaccine against SARS-COV-2, but there is some debate.
There are more than 300 patients who are undergoing testing in the hospital as of April 2020.
Seven clinical trials have already been conducted to evaluate the safety of the fever treatment, including four studies on hydrochloricquine and chloroquine.
The Chinese study included the vaccine, and there were nine trials of remdesivir in several countries due to the pandemic in late April.
A comprehensive review of clinical development for COVID-19 vaccine and experimental drugs is available. as of April 2020. Several antiviral drugs are being evaluated for the treatment of COVID-19, including remdesivir chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, looinavir/ritonavir and lopinavir/ritomavir plus inyerferon beta.
There is evidence of efficacy by remdesivir, as of March 2020.
Remedial effects were seen in patients treated with remdesivir.
Phase III clinical trials are being conducted in the United States, China and Italy. Chloroquine A was previously used for the treatment of malaria, a study was conducted in China in 2020 with the first week of exposure.
However, there is a call for confirmation of this research.
Health authorities in Korea and China recommend the use of chloroquine.
However, Wuhan University of Epidemiology, has recommended the use of one gram of nitrate daily, noting that the use of two is extremely dangerous and can lead to malnutrition.
On 28 March 2020, the FDA issued an emergency advisory to allow the use of hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine in the treatment of COVID-19 patients.Chinese guidelines 7th edition include interferon, ribavirin or umifenovir for use against COVID-19.
Previous research has suggested that high dosage intake of ribavirin is important in the fight against SARS-CoV-2 in vitro.
The use of Nitazoxanide was recommended for further research after showing poor anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity.The study showed that early spike protein priming by transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) was important for SARS-CoV-2 entry by binding to the ACE2 receptor.
The testing of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine with coba with azithromycin has a significant limitation that prevents the medical community from accepting these treatments without further testing. Oseltamivir is not inhibitory in the test vessel SARS-CoV-2 and has no known role in the treatment of COVID-19.
Cytokine storm can be a problem if the COVID-19 infection is severe.
There is evidence that hydroxychloroquine has a cytokine-like chemical structure.China has included tociizumab in its treatment regimen after a small study.
It is in a phase 2 trial that was not conducted anywhere in Italy after showing results in patients with severe pain.
Combined with serum ferritin blood samples to detect cytokine storms, its function is to block certain complications that are thought to cause death in some people with the disease.
The FDA approved the addition of an interleukin-6 receptor antagonist based on a case study that was being reviewed to treat steroid refractory cytokine release syndrome caused by a different cause, CAR T cell therapy, in 2017.
To date there is no random evidence that tocilizumab can treat CRS.
Transfer of purified and collected antibodies obtained through the immune system of people recovering from COVID-19 infection to people undergoing testing as a non-invasive method.
This system was tried for SARS with insufficient results.
Viral immunity is a process that increases the body's immune response to combine protection against SARS-CoV-2.
Other mechanisms may be available, such as cellular cytotoxicity and phagocytosis.
Other forms of immune enhancement, for example, use monoclonal antibodies that are activated.
Convalescent serum, which consists of a plasma segment derived from the therapist and contains anti-viral chemicals from the same virus, may be added for early use.
Coronavirus, is a group of symptomatically related diseases.
Li Wenliang, a doctor at Wuhan Central Hospital, who later contracted the virus and died from COVID-19 after announcing the outbreak.
