Welsh AM 's concerned with images like the Muppet
There is a quarrel among some members of the Assembly on the suggestion that the title of his post should be changed to MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
This is because there are plans to rename the Assembly to the Welsh Parliament.
All the AMs in the political sphere are concerned that they may be ridiculed.
A Labour AM said that his group was concerned about it being linked to the Twp and the Pwp.
For readers outside Wales: In Welsh, twp means stupid and pwp means shit.
A plaid AM said the entire group was "not happy" and suggested other options.
One Welsh political party said its group was "free-thinking" on the name change, but noted that a small verbal change in the words could have defeated the MWP.
In this context, the letter w in Welsh is pronounced exactly as the letter u is pronounced in Yorkshire English.
The Assembly Commission, which is currently drafting legislation on the name change, said: "The final decision of any commentator as to what the members of the Assembly are called will certainly be a matter for the members themselves".
As per the Government of Wales Act 2017, the Welsh Assembly has the right to change its name.
In June, the commission reported the results of a public consultation on the proposals which had received overwhelming support for the Assembly to be renamed the Welsh Parliament.
In the case of the AM title, the Commission supported the Welsh MPs or WMP, but the MWP option received the most support in public advice.
Clearly, AM is suggesting several other options, but it is getting difficult for Presiding Officer Elin Jones to reach consensus, and he expects to present a legislative draft for change within weeks.
The legislative changes being prepared for the changes will also include other changes in the working methods in the Assembly, including the rules for disqualification of AM and the format of the committee system.
When debating the legislation, the AM will get the last vote on the question of what they should be called.
Macedonians are going to vote to change the name of the country
On Sunday, voters will vote on whether to change the name of their country to "Republic of North Macedonia".
The popular vote was called to resolve a decades-old dispute with neighboring Greece, which also has a province named Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that its northern neighbour' s name refers to its province, and has repeatedly objected to its bids to join the EU and NATO.
The Macedonian president, a rival to the referendum on the name change, says he will ignore the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Ze'ev, have argued that the name change is merely a prerequisite for joining the EU and NATO.
St. Martin's bells are being hung less and less because of the dwindling churches in Harlem.
"The elders I spoke to about the history of the area told me that there used to be a bar and a church on every corner", said Mr. Adams.
"Today, everything is ending".
He said that the lowering of the bar was understandable.
He said, "People are being made into a different society today.
"The bar is no longer the living room of the neighborhood where people go every day".
As for the churches, they are worried that the money raised from the sale of the properties will not last as long as the leaders hope, "and sooner or later the money will run out or the leaders will be right back where they started".
He added that churches may have been turned into proprietary apartment buildings with a variety of occupants who would not help to protect the remaining places of worship in the vicinity.
He said, "These buildings will have an increasing number of people who are buying the houses built in them as property rights and thus there will come a time when these churches will be completely closed, because it is unlikely that many of these people who are coming in with property rights will become members of these churches.
Both churches were built by whites from the religious community before Harlem became the Black Metropolis - the Metropolitan Community - in 1870, a decade after St. Martin's.
The original white people of the Methodist religious society left in the 1930s.
These buildings were occupied by the black people of the religious community who worshipped at the nearby places of worship.
St. Martin was occupied by a black religious community under that pastor John Howard Johnson who led the removal of the retailers on 125th Street, the main shopping area in Harlem, opposed to the hiring or promotion of black people.
The building was badly damaged by fire in 1939, but the bell was started after Father Johnson's followers planned to rebuild it.
Father Johnson's son and St. Martin's heir, Father David Johnson, proudly called the bell ringing "the opening of the doors of fortune for the poor".
In July, the bell - sounding expert described it as "a cultural heritage" and "a priceless historical instrument".
University of Michigan expert Tiffany Ng also noted that this was the first bell in the world to be played by black musician Dionysio A. Lind, who played a very large bell in a Riverside church 18 years ago.
Mr Merryweather said that no one else was put in his place at St Martin's.
What happened in St. Martin in the last few months became a complex story of craftsmen and contractors, some of them appointed by the general leaders of the Church and the rest by the provinces associated with the religion.
Vestry (where the liturgical items are kept) is taken over by the parish (priests of the area) made up of the lay leader - In July, the province raised concerns that the province would "demand to meet the costs" for the vestry, whether or not the vestry was involved in hiring craftsmen and contractors appointed in the province.
Some pastors in the area complained of a lack of clarity from the province.
A 13-year-old boy was injured by a shark attack while diving to catch a crab.
Officials say the 13-year-old was attacked and injured by a shark on Saturday while he was diving in California on the opening day of lobster season.
The attack took place just before 7am near Beacon Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hummel of KSWB-TV in San Diego said that on Saturday morning he had been diving with friends for about half an hour when he heard a boy screaming for help and then he went with a group to get him out of the water.
Hummel said that at first he thought the boy had made a noise in the excitement of catching the crab, but then he realized that he was shouting, 'Something is biting me!
I'm getting bitten by something!'
Hammel said that when he saw the boy he found that the entire vertebra of the boy was burst.
Hummel said, "I called out to everyone to get out of the water: there is a shark in the water!"
The teenager was admitted to the Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego where his condition is said to be critical.
The species of the attacking shark has not been identified.
Lifeguard Captain Larry Gills told the media that a shark had been spotted in the area a few weeks ago, but it was found to be not a dangerous shark species.
Gills further said that the upper part of the victim's torso is badly injured.
For investigation and security purposes, the authorities have blocked beach access from Ponto Beach in Casalblade to Swamis Beach in Asinitas for 48 hours.
Gills said there are more than 135 shark species in the area, but most of them are not considered dangerous.
Sainsbury's plans to move into the UK beauty market
Sainsbury's is going to include department store style Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams by hiring expert assistants with beauty products.
Despite the continued decline in fashion goods and home goods sales, it is set to join the UK's £2.8 billion beauty market with good volumes, these large volumes of beauty products will be tested in 11 stores across the country and if the plan is successful, more stores will be boosted to turnover next year.
The investment in beauty is being made in supermarkets, which are aimed at finding their place in the market after bringing in TVs, microwave and household items.
Sainsbury's said that this will double its product offering by bringing it to 3,000 products for the first time, including brands like Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
Existing products from L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also have more opportunities with branded products found in shops like Boots.
Supermarkets are also re-launching their boutique makeup products to make most products vegan-friendly - which will increase the demand for it somewhat faster among smaller shoppers.
In addition, fragrance retailer Fragerance Shop will also test the special feature in two Sainsbury's stores, the first of which opened in Croydon, South London last week and the second is due to open in Sealy Oak, Birmingham later this year.
In the shift of online shopping and local convenience stores, i. e. supermarkets, where the quantity of food items sold every day is decreasing, more and more efforts are being made to increase visits.
Sainsbury's chief executive, Mike Coop, said people will come to the outlet like department stores more quickly as the supermarket chain is trying to compete with the more service and nonfood discounters Aldi and Lidl.
Sainsbury's is installing Argos outlets in hundreds of stores and has opened many stores since it introduced the two chains two years ago, showing that grocery sales have been boosted and the deal made more profitable.
The supermarket's previous attempt to re-market beauty and pharmacy products had failed.
Sainsbury's had a joint venture with Boots in the early 2000s, but had to end the joint venture due to the way the revenue from drugstores in its supermarkets was divided.
Three years ago, Sainsbury's sold the pharmacy business's 281 stores for £125 million to Selessio, the owner of the Lloyds pharmacy chain, after which a new strategy emerged.
It was reported that Lloyds will play a key role in the scheme by adding La Roche-Posay and Vichy as well as several top luxury skincare brands in the four stores.
Sainsbury's Commercial Director, Paul Mills-Hicks said: "We have changed the look and feel of our beauty products to enhance the environment for our customers.
We have also added specially trained colleagues who will help us with advice.
We have built our brand's reach to suit everyone's needs and appealing surroundings and in convenient locations, which means we have reached a desirable destination for beauty products that challenge the old ways of shopping".
Peter Jones expresses regret at the termination of the £11 million deal with Holy Will.
To focus on his new contract with Marks & Spencer and ITV, Peter Jones was dismayed when TV presenter Holly Bilubie decided to part with the £11 million deal for the lifestyle brand business of Dragons Den star Peter Jones.
Bilubie has absolutely no time for its homeware and accessories brand Truly.
The two were being compared with Gwyneth Paltrow 's Goop brand.
The 37-year-old morning presenter announced his separation on Instagram.
Holly Billubi withdrew from her lucrative lifestyle brand business at the last minute with Dragons Den star Peter Jones - so she could focus on her new and fantastic contract with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources have revealed that when TV's Golden Girl admitted during a tense meeting at Jones's business headquarters in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, on Tuesday that she was being separated from her new deal - worth £1.5 million - Jones was angry, meaning that Billubi now does not have enough time to give her homewear and accessory brand Truly.
The business was being compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's brand Goop and was being considered to double the estimated £11 million offered by Willoughby.
Willoughby, 37, announced on Instagram that she was parting ways with Truly after Jones left the UK to visit one of her holiday homes.
One source said: "Truly was once at the top of Holly 's priorities.
It was considered as its long-term future which would make the brand go far in the next few decades.
His decision shocked everyone involved in the business.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday, it was so close to starting.
The warehouse at Marlow headquarters is full of items to be sold. "
Experts believe that the departure of Britain's richest star could cost the firm millions of pounds as it has invested heavily in products ranging from cushions and candles to clothing and homeware, and it is also likely to delay its launch.
At the same time, it can end a long friendship.
Bilubie's three children and husband Dan Baldwin have been very close to Jones and his wife, Tara Cap, for the past ten years.
Willuby co-founded Truly with Cap in 2016 and Jones, 52, joined as chairman in March.
The couple and Jones, who vacation together, own 40 percent of Baldwin 's TV production company.
Bilubie has now become a brand ambassador for M&S and will be replacing Ant McPartlin to host ITV's I'm A Celebrity.
Last night a source close to Jones said, "We would like nothing to do with his business affairs".
'Serious Negotiations' and then we agreed
He joked with the criticism that the news media would continue to comment on him, some would consider it a different job than the presidency and would be too positive about the North Korean leader.
Why has President Trump made so many sacrifices?
Trump said in his flashy "news anchor" voice.
"I have not sacrificed anything".
He said Kim is interested in a second meeting after their first meeting in Singapore in June, the first meeting being a major step taken by Trump to denuclearize North Korea.
But, the non - nuclear talks were stopped.
More than three months after the summit in June in Singapore, North Korea's top diplomat Ri Yong Ho told world leaders at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that the North was not waiting for a "coherent response" from the US to North Korea's initial disarmament steps.
Instead, he said, the U.S. has continued to press for sanctions to be maintained.
Trump's rally speech was overly optimistic.
"We are committed to building good relations with North Korea.
We were going to war with North Korea.
which would have killed millions of people.
Now our relationship has become very good.
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim have yielded positive results - including completing rocket tests, helping free hostages and returning surviving US troops home.
At the same time, he defended his unusual approach in negotiating the relationship with Kim.
Pointing directly at the crowd in front of him, Trump said, "It's very easy to stay in the presidency, but with 10,000 people from outside the country trying to get into the area, we'll only have about 200 people to stop them".
The tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia devastated an island, killing hundreds
After the earthquake in Lombok, foreign NGOs were told that they were not needed for the event.
Despite the destruction of more than 10 percent of the population of Lombok, no national disaster was declared, and a condition was placed for international assistance.
Ms. Sumbu said, "Unfortunately, in some situations, they were clearly not asking for international help, so it was a little bit more challenging".
Nevertheless, Save the Children visited Palu with a team, but it is not yet certain whether staff from other countries can come to help.
National Disaster Agency spokesman Mr. Sutopo says Indonesian officials were assessing the situation in Palu, looking to see if international agencies would be allowed to contribute to the relief effort.
Given the repeated occurrences of such situations in Indonesia, it seems that the country is not preparing for a natural disaster at all.
Although shelters have been built for people affected by the tsunami in Aichi, they are not like the shelters on other beaches.
There has been a decrease in the number of tsunami warning sirens in Palu, no matter how damaging the warning, which is likely to increase the loss of life.
Even though the best time to visit is in the summer, getting around the many islands of Indonesia is challenging.
The provision of transport and goods from natural disasters is always complex.
The earthquake victims are being brought for treatment to a hospital in Lompoc, which is far from Palu and takes at least three days to reach from the new disaster site.
President Joko Widodo used Indonesia's poor infrastructure as an issue for his election campaign and spent a lot of money on improving roads and railways.
But Mr. Jocko's administration has been dispersed by a lack of funds as reelections are due next year.
Mr. Joko is also pressured by sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where Muslim-majority members have made religious ideology more conservative.
More than 1,000 people died and over ten thousand were left homeless as Christian and Muslim gangs fought one another in the streets, using knives, bows and arrows and other dangerous weapons.
Watch: Liverpool's Daniel Sturridge has mysteriously bowed to Chelsea to tie the match.
On Saturday, Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from relegation from the Premier League by scoring in the 89th minute at Stamford Bridge in London.
From about 30 yards away, Sturridge received a pass from Zerdán Shíkiri, at the time his team was trailing Chelsea 1-0 on goal.
He hit the ball with his left foot before making a far post shot.
This effort of his went to the top right corner of the net with the height above the box.
Finally, the ball fell out of KEPPA ARIZABLAGA 's grip and went into the net.
Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com, "It was just trying to get in that position, to get in contact with the ball and get it as far away from players like Shaq as possible, so I just tried to take as much time as I could for myself".
"I saw the spikes coming and I touched it once and didn't think about it too much and just shot it".
Chelsea were leading 1-0 at halftime after Belgium 's best player Eden Hazard scored in the 25th minute.
Before the ball reached the midfield and Liverpool half of the game, the Blues striker passed to Mateo Kovacic in that game.
Kovacic delivered the ball very quickly in the midfield.
Then, he beautifully shot the ball, causing Hazard to go into the box.
Hazard came out of defence and sent Liverpool's Alison Baker off the net with a left foot shot from behind.
Liverpool will now take on Napoli in the Champions League group stage at Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy, at 3pm on Wednesday.
Chelsea will face the hosts on Thursday at 3pm in London in the UEFA Europa League.
Death toll from Indonesia tsunami rises to 832
The death toll from the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia has risen to 832, the country's disaster agency said early Sunday.
Agency spokesperson Sutopo Purwo Nugroho told a news conference that many people were reported to be trapped in the rubble after a 7.5-magnitude earthquake and a 20-foot tsunami struck Friday.
The city of Palu, with a population of over 380,000, was engulfed in a series of buildings collapse, leaving the city in ruins.

The statue of Cromwell in front of Parliament has recently become the most famous monument, and it has been re-written in history.
His exile would be a perfect justice for the destruction of many of England 's cultural and religious artefacts by his fanatical Puritan followers like his Taliban.
But the Cromwell Society called Mr. Crick 's suggestion "silly" and "an attempt to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Society, said: "In the current debate on the removal of statues, there was a strong possibility that the statue of Oliver Cromwell outside the Palace of Westminster would be targeted.
The emblem of the English Civil War was neither ordered nor made by Cromwell.
It may be wrong to think that Cromwell would have given up on the works of his ancestor Thomas in the last century.
According to Sir William Hame Thorecrofft, Cromwell's best representation is a testament to the 19th century's thinking and part of the history of a statue that many still consider to be worthy of admiration.
Mr Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is respected by many people, perhaps because most people still know him as the protector of Parliament against external pressures in the late 19th century, in the case of the monarchy.
Nevertheless, they are considered to be the exact representatives, which remains the subject of debate historically.
It is clear that our nation has evolved since the conflict in the mid-17th century, and Cromwell's statue remains a personal identity reflecting one side of that division.
His achievements as Lord Protector are commendable and memorable.
A deadly pig attacks a Chinese farmer, killing the farmer
According to local media reports, a farmer was attacked by a pig in a market in southwestern China, killing the farmer.
The South China Morning Post reported on Sunday that the man, identified only by his surname "Yuan", had been found with severe injuries and was found bleeding near a pig pen in the market of Liupanshui, Guizhou province.
On May 30, 2005, a pig farmer in Xining, Qinghai Province, China, was preparing to vaccinate pigs in a pig pen.
He reportedly came to the market on Wednesday with his cousin who lives in nearby Yunnan province to sell 15 pigs.
The next morning, his cousin died and a pig pen door was found open nearby.
He said that in the pigsty he saw a large male pig with blood on his mouth.
According to the report, a forensic investigation confirmed that a pig weighing 550 pounds attacked the farmer and killed him.
According to the Guiyang Evening News, her cousin, surnamed Wu, said, "My cousin's legs were covered in blood and completely injured. "
Security camera footage showed Yuan entering the market to feed his pigs at 4. 40 am on Thursday.
His body was recovered about an hour later.
It was not the pig Yuan or his Kazun that attacked and killed the man.
A market manager told Evening News that the pig was kept in a cage to prevent it from attacking a person, although police had to survey the scene and gather evidence.
Yuan's family and market officials are reportedly negotiating compensation for his death.
However, there have been rare cases of pigs attacking people in the past.
In 2016, a woman and her husband were attacked by a pig on their farm in Massachusetts, leaving the man critically injured.
Ten years ago, a 650-pound pig attacked a Welsh farmer while he was on his tractor, attacking the farmer until his wife scared the animal away.
In 2012, an Oregon farmer was attacked and killed by his pigs and fed on them, a Manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs are not normally aggressive, but can be "dangerous" when they taste blood.
"They're just playing.
They bite with their teeth and are very inventive... they're not meant to hurt you.
You just have to give them enough respect, she said.
The remainder of Hurricane Rosa caused heavy rainfall in the southwestern United States
Hurricane Rosa is expected to weaken as it moves over the cold waters off the northern coast of Mexico.
However, the rains will cause flooding in northern Mexico and the southwestern United States in the coming days.
At 5 a.m. eastern time on Sunday, Rosa registered winds of 85 mph, a Category 1 hurricane, and was located 385 miles southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to move northwards on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a trench is forming over the Pacific Ocean and is moving toward the west coast of the United States. As Tropical Storm Rosa approaches the Baja California Peninsula on Monday, a very large tropical moisture will begin to move across northern areas of the southwestern United States.
Rosa will bring 10 inches of rain to parts of Mexico on Monday.
After that, the moisture from the trough will mix with the tropical moisture in the coming days to bring heavy rainfall in the southwest.
Locally, 1 to 4 inches of rainfall will create hazardous flooding, debris runoff and landslides in the desert.
Extreme tropical moisture will cause rainfall to be 2 to 3 inches in some places, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
2 to 4 inches of rain is likely in most parts of the southwestern part, especially Arizona.
The sporadic nature of tropical rainfall can lead to severe flooding in poor conditions.
In view of the risk of tropical rainfall, it is strongly advised to stay out of the low - level desert.
The heavy rains can cause valleys to become treacherous rivers and thunderstorms, as well as high winds and dust flows in local areas.
The incoming trough will cause locally heavy rainfall in parts of the southern California coast.
Over half an inch of rainfall is likely in total, which may cause some debris and slippery conditions on roads.
This will be the first rain of the wet season in the region.
Some sporadic tropical rain will begin to fall in Arizona on Sunday evening and Monday morning before becoming more widespread on Monday and Tuesday evening.
Heavy rain will fall in the Four Corners on Tuesday and continue till Wednesday.
Temperatures can change rapidly throughout the U.S. in October because the Arctic is cooler, but the tropics are hotter.
Sometimes this short distance causes strange changes in temperature.
The unusual temperature variations in the central U. S. on Sunday are a good example.
There is a difference of about 20 degrees in temperature between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
In the next few days, the weather will warm up and the heat will increase due to the heat.
Most of the central and eastern U.S. is expected to have warm weather through October, ranging from the southern plains to the wide 80s in some areas of the Northeast.
On Tuesday, New York City could reach 80 degrees, nearly 10 degrees above average.
Our long-term climate forecasts indicate that there is a strong likelihood of higher than average temperatures in the eastern U.S. in the first six months of October.
Over 20 million people watched the Brett Kavanaugh trial
More than 20 million people watched the Supreme Court hearing on Thursday of the trial of Brett Kavanaugh and the woman who accused him of sexual abuse allegedly committed in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford, on six television channels.
Meanwhile, political deadlock was also seen, with broadcasters halting Friday's regular program Last-Minute Twist: An Agreement Engineered by Arizona Sen. The lawsuit was filed by FBI's Jeff Flake after investigating the allegations for a week.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that he was absolutely certain that Cavanaugh drugged her and tried to strip her naked at a high school party.
Defending himself, Cavanough said he was absolutely certain that this did not happen at all.
It is estimated that more than 20.4 million people viewed the Nielsen report on Friday.
The company was calculating the average viewership on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
Data for PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network as well as other channels showing it were not immediately available.
Also, Nielsen usually has some difficulty counting people who see offices.
From this perspective, it's the same as the number of people who watch a playoff football game or the Academy Awards.
Nielsen reported that Fox News, which the commentator has strongly supported Cavanough's appointment, led all channels, with an average of 5.69 million viewers attending the day's hearings.
The viewership on ABC was 3.26 million and it was in second place.
There were 3.1 million viewers on CBS, 2.94 million on NBC, 2.89 million on MSNBC and 2.52 million on CNN, Nielsen reported.
The audience was very interested.
Flake was the central figure in the drama on Friday.
A statement released by the liberal Republican's office after the term that said they would speak out on behalf of Cavannough, appeared on Friday morning in front of CNN and CBS cameras, at the time protesting protesters shouting against the judicial committee hearing.
He stood for a few minutes with his eyes closed as he was being insulted, and it was shown live on CNN.
One woman said, "Wait, I'm standing right here in front of you.
"Do you think they are telling the country the right thing?
They were asked, "Have you been brought to power to make so many women powerless?"
Flake said that a statement was issued by his office before the elevator was shut down, saying that he would be able to make his full statement at the committee hearing.
When the Judiciary Committee was moving Cavanough's nomination for a vote to the full Senate, the cable and broadcast channels were showing everything live for hours afterwards.
But Flake said he would do so with full understanding that the FBI would look into the charges against the nominees next week, as urged by the minority Democrat.
Flake discussed this with his friend, Democratic Sen. Chris Coons.
After consulting with Koons and several senators, Flake made his decision.
Fleck loved power, because it was clear that approving Cavanaugh without a trial would not win the Republican vote.
President Trump has approved an FBI investigation into the accusations against Cavanoah.
British Prime Minister May accused critics of "politicising" Brexit.
In an interview with the Sunday Times newspaper, Prime Minister Theresa May urged critics to stop playing with the UK 's future by making 'politics a game' in the EU and to focus on the national interest.
Prime Minister Theresa May may attend the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, UK on 29th September 2018.
On the front page of the paper, right next to his interview, was an interview with his former foreign minister, Boris Johnson, in which Boris Johnson tried to suppress the attack on him over the so-called Chequers plan for Brexit, his statement that Britain and the EU should keep pace with each other, which is "completely pointless".
Wade Simms shot: Police detain a suspect in the death of an LSU player, Dighton Simpson
Police detained a suspect in the shooting death of Wade Sims, a 20-year-old LSU basketball player.
The Baton Rouge Police Department said that 20-year-old Dayton Simpson has been taken into custody and booked on a charge of second-degree murder.
A video of the encounter between Simms and Simpson was released by authorities, and police reported that Simms' glasses were lost at the time of the encounter.
Police recovered the glasses from the scene and said that the DNA was found to be Simpson's, according to a WAFB report from CBS.
Simpson was questioned by police who said he fatally shot Wade to death.
The Advocate's report said he was set for $350,000.
The East Baton Rouge Parish Coroner's office released an initial report Friday, stating that the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the neck.
The department is crediting the Louisiana State Police's Fugitive Task Force, the State Police Crime Lab, Southern University Police and local investigators for the arrests.
LSU athletic director Joe Alalewah thanked the law enforcement in the area for its "hard work and pursuit of justice".
Sims was 20 years old.
He was 6'6", grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father Wayne lives, also played basketball for LSU.
He averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds in last season's games.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team is "shocked" and "very sad" by Wade's death.
Wade said: "The question of who will take his place will always remain.
Volcanic ash found in Mexico City
Ash from the Popocatepetl volcano has been found in the southern areas of Mexico's capital.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention warned Mexican citizens on Saturday to stay away from the volcano, citing the eruption of the volcano's crater, which has recorded 183 eruptions of gas and ash in 24 hours.
The centre was monitoring several shocks and vibrations.
Pictures posted on social media showed thin layers of ash-coated car windshields in neighborhoods of Mexico City's Exochimilco neighborhood.
In September 2017, a 7.1 magnitude earthquake struck in Central Mexico, since then geophysicists have noticed the increased activity of the volcano which is 45 miles (72 kilometers) southeast of the Capitol.
The volcano "Don Goyo" has been active since 1994.
Police clashes with Catalan separatists on Independence Vote Anniversary
Six people from Barcelona were detained after pro-independence protesters clashed with riot police on Saturday, and thousands of rivals joined the protests on the first anniversary of the vote to vote on secession in Catalonia.
A group of masked pro-separatists threw eggs and powder paint at riot police, blackened the road, causing trouble for commuters.
The police used their sticks to control the clash and later also engaged in hand - to - hand combat.
Pro - independence groups chanted "no forget, no forgiveness" for several hours while union protesters chanted "Spain remains immortal".
According to local press reports, fourteen people were treated for injuries sustained during the demonstration.
The October 1 referendum, which Madrid considers illegal, has been escalating tensions in the independent-minded areas for a year, but Catalans with separatist views were celebrating.
The voters for independence chose the best way, although there were few who strongly opposed the vote against secession.
Catalan officials said that about 1,000 people were injured last year when police tried to stop people from advancing to the area's polling stations amid clashes.
Pro-independence groups stayed there all night on Friday to assist the National Police in stopping the demonstration.
The performance was postponed, but he was forced to make a different decision.
Narcisse Terminas, a 68-year-old electrician who arrived with his wife to participate in the separatist protest, said he saw no possibility of Catalonia becoming independent.
Our best year was last year.
I saw my parents expressing their happiness by voting, but it seems that we are stuck now, he said.
Despite a small victory in the regional elections last December, Catalonia's pro-independence parties struggled to maintain influence this year with many of their prominent leaders, whether in exposing themselves or waiting for the ballot box to be organized and their role in the continuing declaration of independence to be blocked.
Juan Puig, a 42 - year - old mechanic who recorded the protest on his phone to assist the police, said that the clash between the politicians on both sides had been prevented.
She said, "It's become too stressful".
On Saturday, Orol Junquers, one of nine Catalan leaders who have been in pre-trial detention since late last year, announced that he would run in the European Parliament elections next year.
"Fighting European elections as a candidate is the best way to denounce the return to democratic values and the return we have seen in the Spanish government", he said.
LondonDairy: Car home attackers detained
Three men aged 33, 34 and 39 have been detained for repeatedly attacking a house in Londonderry in a car.
The incident took place in the Ballynaagar Crescent at about 19:30 BST on Thursday.
Deputy Inspector Bob Blemings reported that the doors and the building were damaged.
In some places the crossbow may have been attacked by a car.
Manga led Livingston to a 1-0 win against Rangers.
Dolly Menga's first goal ensured Livingston's victory
According to the manager of the Ibrox club, the quick-forward Livingston shocked the Rangers and Steven Gerrard had to take responsibility for only his second defeat in 18 matches.
Dolly Menga's strike made up the gap that was equaled by Gary Holt's side move with Hibernian in the second half of the match.
Gerrard's side fell one step short of victory in this season's premiership and will face the leaders Hurts next Sunday, who are eight points behind.
Earlier, on Thursday, Rangers hosted Rapid Vienna in the Europa League.
Meanwhile, Livingston is winning in a six-game division series after replacing Kenny Miller last month with head coach Holt.
Livingston missed showing his game to the visitors.
Holt's team should have been ahead long before the score, also, his great game caused a lot of problems to the Rangers.
Scott Robinson broke the record, but fell behind in goal attempts, then Allen Lithgow slipped and was only able to stay direct after his best effort to complete the goal was Craig Halkett's header.
The hosts had the opportunity to play against the Rangers, they knew they could put the visitors in trouble on set pieces.
And because of this method, he got the important goal.
Rangers got a free-kick and Livingston opened the scoring, Declan Gallagher and Robinson set up Manga, who made a touchdown and scored from the center of the box.
At that stage, the Rangers had consolidated their position, but missed home defence and goalkeeper Liam Kelly was significantly behind,
This pattern continued into the second half, although Alfredo Morelos insisted Kelly be the save.
Scott Pittman's shot was blocked with his feet by Rangers goalkeeper Alan McGregor and Lithgow flicked another Livingston to take full control of the game.
The crosses kept coming and going until the Livingston box was full, while two penalty claims were made after the Hulket challenge, one on bringing up Glenn Middleton and the other on the handball.
The analysis of the 'extraordinary circle' of Livingstone
Alasdair Lamont of BBC Scotland was inducted into the Tony McCarony Arena
Livingston's exceptional performance and result.
For any individual, they were the best, they have continued to raise expectations on this growing trajectory.
His style of play and personality has changed dramatically since his return from the top flight, but most of the credit goes to the way Holt has reshaped the team since his arrival.
There were many good players in it.
Captain Hulket was the best, he served brilliantly, while Menga kept Conor Goldson and Joe Worrell behind.
However, the Rangers lacked learning.
The kind of great performances he has made under Gerard many times were below his standard.
Their final ball was lacking - they had only managed to cut their home side open once - and it was something of a wake-up call for the Rangers, who had kept themselves in the mid-table.
Erdogan received a mixed reception in Cologne
When the leaders of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast in Berlin on Saturday, smiles were lit but to no avail.
It's President Erdogan's last day on a controversial tour of Germany - aimed at improving ties with NATO allies.
They became embroiled in controversies over a range of issues, including human rights, press freedom and Turkey's ascension to the EU.
After that, Erdogan spoke of building a huge new mosque in Cologne.
The city is the area with the largest number of Turkish residents outside of Turkey.
Police stopped the crowd of 25,000 people from gathering in front of the mosque citing security reasons, but many supporters flocked to nearby locations to see their president.
Hundreds of Erdogan-opposed protesters - some of whom were Kurds - also chanted slogans, strongly condemning Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to welcome him into the country.
The two - sided protests saw a split between those who welcomed the visitor, some of whom considered him a German Turkish hero and others who insulted him as a self - serving ruler.
Road accident in Deptford: Cyclist dies after being hit by car
A cyclist in London was killed after being hit by a car.
The accident occurred at about 10:15 BST in the south-east of the city, near the junction of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy street in Deptford.
The driver of the car stopped the car and gave him first aid, but the person died at the scene.
Another cyclist died a few months ago in a hit-and-run on Childress Street, about a mile from the scene of the accident on Saturday.
The Metropolitan Police said that officers were working to identify the man and provide information to his family.
Such incidents are being caused by bending of the road and diversion of bus and motorists are advised to avoid such areas.
Long Larne Prison: Six officers were injured in the riot
The prison office said that six prison officers were injured due to the disturbance in the men's high security prison.
A disturbance occurred at HMP Long Laryn, Worcestershire, at about 09:30 BST on Sunday and is still ongoing.
Tornadoes, specialists in the repair of the mess, are in a wing housing eight prisoners.
The rights at the scene had minor injuries to the face which were treated.
A spokesman for the prison service said: "Special trained prison staff have been deployed to repair the accident at HMP Long Lartin.
Six employees have been treated for injuries.
We have absolutely no tolerance for violence in our prisons, and it is obvious that the individuals responsible for violence will be referred to the police and may be arrested.
There are over 500 inmates at HMP Long Lartin, some of them the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June, it was reported that the prison governor was attacked by an inmate, after which the prison governor was treated in hospital.
Further, in October last year riot officials were called to the jail to fix a serious mess, during which a staff member was attacked with a pool ball.
Hurricane Rosa threatens to bring rapid flooding to Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City (dry areas may benefit)
The threat to the tropics after Hurricane Rosa hit Arizona is still very much alive, but it is already very likely that the remaining capacity of the storm could affect the Desert Southwest in the coming weeks, which would pose a high risk of flooding.
Already on Monday and Tuesday, the National Weather Service announced that the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City, as well as southern and eastern Nevada in western Arizona, southeastern California and Utah, are in high-speed flood danger.
The rain on Monday evening is expected to move across Phoenix on Tuesday, leaving Rosa straight.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix tweeted, "Ten tropical cyclones within 200 miles of Phoenix have maintained tropical storm or depression status since 1950!
Hurricane Katrina (1967) was within 40 miles of the AZ boundary".
Recently, the National Hurricane Center model estimated that the Mogollon Rim in Arizona could receive 2 to 4 inches of rain, with a chance of up to 6 inches.
Other areas of the Central Rockies and Great Basin as well as the Desert Southwest are expected to receive 1 to 2 inches of rain, with up to 4 inches of precipitation.
Outside areas at risk of severe flooding, the Rosas can be a blessing because of the drought in the area.
However, the floods remain a serious concern, but the drought in the Southwest is likely to be a major benefit from the rains.
According to the U.S. Draught Monitor, only 40 percent of Arizona is experiencing severe drought, the second highest category of drought reported by weather.com.
First, Hurricane Rosa will pass through the Baja California Peninsula of Mexico.
Hurricane Rosa had maximum winds of 85 mph Sunday morning, was 385 miles south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico at the time, and is now moving north at 12 mph.
The storm is currently in the cold waters of the Pacific, which is why its strength is decreasing.
Thus, it is expected that the strength of the tropical storm could cause landslides in Mexico on Monday afternoon or evening.
Heavy rain is expected in some areas of Mexico, which could increase the risk of flooding.
According to a report by weather.com, "It is expected to be 3 to 6 inches of rain from Baja California to northwest Sonora, with a chance of 10 inches".
Rosa will then turn into a tropical storm and move northward across Mexico before reaching the Arizona border on Tuesday morning, after which it will move southward into Arizona and southern Utah on Tuesday night.
"The greatest threat from Rosa or its remnants is to Baja California, northwestern Sonora, and the U.S. Desert Southwest, where heavy rainfall is expected", the National Hurricane Center reported.
It is estimated that these rains may cause flash floods and debris flows in the deserts, threaten human lives and cause landslides in mountainous areas.
Midsomer Norton attack: Four people arrested for murder conspiracy
A 16-year-old minor was found injured in Somerset, attacked with a knife, for which the suspects are being held in custody for conspiring to murder three teenage boys and a 20-year-old man.
The teenage boy was found injured in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton at about 04:00 BST on Saturday.
He was taken to hospital for treatment where his condition is being assessed as "good".
Avon and Somerset Police said a 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old were taken into custody overnight from the Redstock area.
The officials have also appealed to the public to contact if anyone has any mobile phone footage of the incident.
Trump called the Kavanaugh problem the "angry face of the Democratic Party".
"Judge Kavanaugh is a figure who has been rejected by the Democratic Party's heartless and insulting tactics", Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump says the trouble Kavanaugh is going through is a result of the Democratic Party's anger during his nomination process.
On Thursday, Kavanaugh testified to Congress about allegations made by Christine Blasey Ford that Kavanaugh sexually assaulted Ford as a teenager decades ago, a charge Kavanaugh has forcefully and emotionally denied.
Ford also gave his testimony about the charge during the hearing.
On Saturday the President said, "The American people saw on that day the virtue and courage of a great man, of a great man".
To the crowd of supporters in West Virginia, he said, "To vote for Judge Kavanaugh is to vote for a man who is the most accomplished jurist of our time, who can uphold the law and judge with a real record of public service.
Speaking of the importance of the Republican vote in medieval elections, the President referred to the nomination of Kavanaugh.
We are now just five weeks away from the election that is the most important of our lives.
I am not involved, but I am involved in fact", he said.
"That's why I'm running for all the candidates who really qualify".
Trump said that Democrats are on a campaign of "resistance and obstruction".
A senior GOP ally told CNN that the first counting of votes on the Senate side in Kavanaugh's nomination is set to begin on Friday.
The earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia killed hundreds of people, and the death toll is rising.
On Saturday, officials reported that when a massive earthquake and tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, the sea began to rise in high waves and at least 384 people died.
A festival was being held on the beach in Palu city on Friday, with hundreds of people gathering, when a six-meter (18 ft) wave broke out after dark, causing havoc, killing many people and destroying everything around them.
The tsunami followed a 7. 5 magnitude earthquake.
"At the time of the tsunami risk yesterday, people on the beach were engaged in their activities and were not in a position to evacuate immediately and got stuck", said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesperson for Indonesia's disaster mitigation agency BNPB, at a briefing in Jakarta.
"The tsunami not only caused deaths, but also swept cars, logs and houses onto the ground. The tsunami traveled in the open sea at 800 km / h (497 mph) before striking the coast, "said Nugroho.
He said that some people climbed trees to escape the tsunami.
16,700 people were evacuated from 24 centres in Palau.
The photos posted by the disaster agency from the air showed that many buildings and shops were destroyed, bridges were turned over and collapsed and a mosque was surrounded by water.
The aftershocks continued on the rocks in the coastal city on Saturday.
2.4 million people in the area experienced the continuous quakes.
Indonesia's Agency for the Assessment and Application of Technology (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy released by Friday's massive earthquake was about 200 times greater than the nuclear bomb dropped on Hiroshima in World War II.
It suggested that the geography of the city, which sits at the end of a long, narrow bay, could increase the size of the tsunami.
Nugraho elaborated on the damage, saying it was "terrible" and that it had caused thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels to collapse.
He said that some bodies were trapped in the rubble of collapsed buildings and that 540 people were injured while 29 people were missing.
Nugroho said the loss of life and damage was likely to be high in the area called Dongolala, 300 kilometres (190 miles) off the coast of Palu, close to the epicentre of the earthquake.
Nugraho said that the communication system in Dongala was "completely damaged".
In a statement, the Red Cross said that more than 300,000 people were staying there and that its staff and volunteers were visiting the affected areas.
It said, "Although this is a tragic event, it could be even more terrible".
On Saturday, the agency criticised the failure to provide information earlier if a tsunami was imminent in Palu, although officials said the warning was due to be issued but the waves had already passed.
A few videos were made and posted on social media by an amateur who could be seen standing on the top floor of the building and a man on the street below was shouting and sounding a terrifying warning.
Within minutes, a huge amount of water began to come out of the beach, washing away buildings and cars.
Reuters was not able to immediately verify the footage.
The earthquake and tsunami caused power problems in Palu and cut communications lines, making it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
With the help of Jakarta and other cities, officials have begun to send cargo planes, officials said, but there is still a need to evacuate people and meet other needs, including food.
The city's airport has been reopened for relief efforts only and will close in October.
President Joko Widodo was scheduled to visit evacuation centres in Palu on Sunday.
The death toll from the tsunami in Indonesia has risen to over 800.
It 's terrible.
Mr. Doseba said that the staff of World Vision, based in Dongagala, made every effort to make the city of Palu safe, the staff has been living in the shelters of the Tirpal in the courtyard of their office, they have seen the destruction with their own eyes.
He said that he had spoken to him and had seen many houses destroyed.
It 's terrible.
Aid groups began to seriously bring in supplies for disaster relief, with some complaining that outside aid workers with special expertise were being denied access to Palu.
Under Indonesian law, foreign funds, equipment and personnel can only be taken in if the disaster area is declared a national disaster area.
But, this has not been done yet.
"The disaster is still at the provincial level", said Ouliya Ariyani, a spokesman for the Indonesian-based Red Cross.
"Once the government says OK, it's a national disaster, we can bring in international aid workers to help, but it hasn't happened yet".
Friends and family members of people who were still missing in Palu after the second night of the earthquake and tsunami on Friday were hoping that their loved ones would be found miraculously, as happens after natural disasters.
On Saturday, a small boy was found trapped in the sewer.
Rescue workers rescued a woman from the rubble on Sunday, with her baby beside her, who had been trapped in the rubble for two days.
Indonesian National Paragliding Team coach Gendon Subando trained two paragliders from the Asian Games dedicated to the cause earlier this month in Indonesia to locate the missing.
Mr. Mandgi was also among those trapped in the Roa Roa Hotel along with his students.
He said, "As a senior in the paragliding field, I too am emotionally overwhelmed.
Mr. Gendon said that the paragliding community started its work after the news of the Roa Roa Hotel collapse, they sent messages to the competitors participating in the festival through WhatsApp.
Yet, his message only showed gray marks, not blue marks.
He said, "I think it means that the message didn't reach the people".
Thieves stole $26,750 when they were putting money in an ATM in Newport, La.
According to a news release from the Newport Police Department, on Friday morning, a Brink employee was depositing money at an ATM in Newport, La., when thieves stole $26,750.
In the news release, Dat. Dennis McCarthy wrote that the driver of the car was emptying an ATM at the entertainment complex and was preparing to put more money in.
While he was busy with his work, a man came running from behind the employee of the brink and ran away with the bag of money which had been put in.
According to the report, there are suspicions about the number of people present at the scene, but the police have not yet been able to ascertain the total number of people present at the scene.
Anyone with information about their identity should call Newport Police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: The rapper changed his name to this.
Rapper Kanye West is going to change his name to this.
He tweeted about the change on Saturday: "Officially, his name will be Kanye West".
West, 41, has been using the name for some time and will use it for the title track of his eighth album, Moniqueer, released in June.
This change is being made in his appearance on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to debut his new album Yandi.
The show's producers said they had removed singer Ariana Grande from the show after she "declined to appear on the show for emotional reasons".
As well as shortening his current professional name, West had previously stated that for him the word has religious significance.
Talking to radio host Big Boy about the title of his album earlier this year, West said, "I believe the word 'it' is used many times in the Bible, and according to the Bible it means 'you.'
So I am you, I am we, this is us.
It is derived from the word kan'ye, which means only one, which is only this - it represents our goodness, our badness, our delusion, everything.
The album is about who we are.
He is one of the many famous rappers who changed their name.
Sean Combs also has many names, such as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he has used his name Love and Brother Love when announcing for the name.
An old friend of West, JAY-Z, has also changed his name with or without hyphens and capital letters.
Mexican AMLO vows not to use military force against civilians
On the 50th anniversary of the country's deadly reprisal against students, Mexican presidential candidate Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador vowed that military force would never again be used against civilians.
At Teltelco Plaza on Saturday, López Obrador pledged that "military force will never be used to pressure the Mexican people".
On October 2, 1968, soldiers opened fire on a peaceful protest in the Plaza, killing more than 300 people, at a time when left - wing student protests were spreading across Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has pledged to support the youth of Mexico, to give monthly grants to students who study and to open more and more free public universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of opportunities for education lead to young people becoming involved in crime.
The U.S. should double the funding for AI
Kai-Fu Lee, an investor and AI entrepreneur who has done a lot for Google, Microsoft and Apple, said that as China is becoming more active in artificial intelligence, the U.S. should double the amount of research spending in the field.
AI has made this comment after numerous US government works, he also said that the US lacks an overall formal AI strategy.
Meanwhile, last year, China launched a plan: its goal to become No. 1 in AI innovation by 2030.
Lee said, "Doubling the AI research budget is a great start, but if you look at all the other countries, the U.S. is way behind, and we're trying to make the next big thing in AI".
In an interview with CNBC this week, Lee said, "Doubling the funding could double the likelihood that the next big AI breakthrough will be in the U.S. "
Li, whose book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of SinoVision Ventures, an investor in Face+, one of China's top AI companies.
In the 1980s, at Carnegie Mellon University he worked on an AI system that far outranked the highest-ranked American Othello player, and later he was appointed to the executive position at Microsoft Research and to the president of Google's China branch.
Lee outlined the technological capabilities of the previous U.S. government, including the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's robot-related challenges, and said it would be the next government to identify the next visionary.
Lee noted that U.S. researchers often face considerable difficulties in obtaining government support.
"It's not China that's removing academic leaders, it's the corporate world", Lee explained.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other tech companies have hired university veterans to work on AI.
Lee explained that the U.S. could help its AI efforts by changing its immigration policy.
He said, "In my opinion, the permission to pursue a PhD in AI through a green card should be automatic.
In July 2017, China's State Council released its Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan.
The National Science Foundation and other government organizations provide grants to U.S. researchers in the same way that the National Natural Science Foundation of China funds academic institutes, but the quality of teaching in China is not very good, Li said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense opened a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, which aims to engage industry and academic partners, and the White House announced the creation of a Select Committee for Artificial Intelligence.
Further, this month DARPA launched an initiative called AI Next, which is expected to invest $2 billion.
For NSF, right now, this investment is over $100 million a year in AI research.
Meanwhile, in the US, legislation was passed that would ignore calls for a National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence for months.
The Macedonians voted on whether to change the name of the country
On Sunday, Macedonians voted on whether to change the country's name to "Republic of North Macedonia", a move that would resolve a decades-old dispute with Greece over Greece's suspension of its membership bids in the European Union and NATO.
Greece also has a province called Macedonia, which it says is named after its northern neighbor, which has two names for the same claim and is already in NATO and the European Union.
The two governments struck a deal in June on the basis of the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents opposed it and said that changing the name of Macedonia would weaken the ethnic identity of the majority of the people living in Slavic Macedonia.
President George Ivanov, who said he would not go to the referendum and would boycott the campaign, expressed doubts that the minimum 50 percent required for this vote would be valid.
The ballot paper will read: "Do you approve of the agreement with Greece for membership in NATO and the EU?"
Prime Minister Zoran Zev, as well as supporters of the name change, say it is important for Macedonia to join bodies such as the EU and NATO, one of the countries that emerged from the collapse of Yugoslavia.
Olivera Georgievska, 79, from Skopje, said, "Today I came to vote for the future of the country, the future of the young people in Macedonia, that they can live freely under the umbrella of the EU because it means a safe life for all of us".
Although it is not being legally pushed for, most members of Parliament say they will act on the results of the vote to make it decisive.
A two - third majority is required to change the name of the Parliament.
The State Election Commission says that no irregularities were reported till 1 pm.
However, in 2016, when the last parliamentary election was held, voter turnout was only 16 percent, compared to 34 percent, with 66 percent of registered voters casting their ballots.
Gozo Tanevsky, a 62 - year - old voter living in the capital Skopje, said, "I came to vote because of my children, our place in Europe. "
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zev, along with his wife Zorica and son Dusko, went to Macedonia to vote on the name change, so that the country would join NATO and the European Union on September 30, 2018 in Stromika, Macedonia.
In front of the Parliament, 54 - year - old Vladimir Kavardarkov, from Skopje, was preparing a small stage and setting chairs in front of the tents set up by those opposing the vote.
"We want NATO and EU membership, but we want to join with our heads held high, not through an agreement", Kavardarov said.
Our country may be poor, but we have our pride.
If they don 't want us to join in the name of Macedonia, that 's fine, we can join with other countries like China and Russia and become part of the Euro - Asian integration.
Prime Minister Zev has said that NATO membership will bring much-needed investment to Macedonia, where unemployment is over 20 percent.
After casting his vote, Zeev said, "I think there will be a lot of positive votes because more than 80 percent of our citizens agree to join the EU and NATO".
He said that the "yes" result would "confirm our future".
A survey published last Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Policy Research showed that 30 to 43 percent of voters in the mandatory poll would participate in the vote.
A second poll conducted by Macedonia's Telma TV on Sunday showed that 57 percent of people are planning to vote.
Of those, 70 percent agree to vote yes.
More than 50 percent of the votes are required for the vote to be successful.
If the vote fails, it will be the first serious blow to the policy of the Western government that was formed in May last year.
Watch: Manchester City's Sergio Aguero forced the whole of Brighton to defend to score
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling defended well against Brighton in Manchester City's 2-0 win at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester City, England on Saturday.
Ironically, Aguero scored his own easy goal in the 65th minute.
The Argentine striker was given a pass in midfield in the opening round.
He defended against three Brighton players as soon as they were in the open field.
Aguero then found himself surrounded by four opposition players.
He pushed a defending player before Brighton moved forward from the corner of the box.
Then, finding Sterling, he sent a pass to his left.
The English forward used his first touch in the box to return the ball to Aguero, who used his left boot to beat Brighton keeper Matthew Ryan and the ball went out of his right side and into the net.
City manager Pep Guardiola told the reporter, "Aguero has some problems with his legs that are bothering him".
We talked about his game for 55, 60 minutes.
And that is what happened.
We were lucky that he scored at the same time.
But, it was thanks to Sterling that the Sky Blues got the early advantage in the Premier League encounter.
In the 29th minute, he got the goal.
Aguero got the ball deep in the Brighton area in that game.
He got the ball out of Leroy Sen 's left side beautifully.
Stirling, who was playing well, was given a few touches before being sent off.
Just before the hand of the game slipped, Sky Blues tapped the ball forward.
The Champions League group play will now take place from Hoffenheim on Tuesday at 12:55pm at the Rhein-Necker-Arena in Sinsim, Germany.
The Rockies are playing the Chasers to beat him.
After the playoff controversy with the Nationals was over, there was no great reason to push for another start.
But, always competitive, Schäger is hoping to score big against the Colorado Rockies on Sunday, but the playoffs are still just a possibility for the Rockies, who won the NL West with the Los Angeles Dodgers.
The Rockies clinched a wild-card spot with a 5-2 win over the Nationals on Friday night, but they are still looking to capture the first division title.
"Even if we're not playing very well, we can at least play to know that the crowd and the atmosphere of the other team in Denver will be for perhaps the highest level of play I'll face this year.
Why wouldn 't I want to play that game?"
The Nationals have yet to be told about the starter for Sunday, but it is being heard that in such a situation Shazer could be included.
Scheherer, playing for his 34th start, risked a bullpen session on Thursday and will pitch at his normal on Sunday.
The Washington right-hander is 18-7 with a 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings this season.
Trump rallies in West Virginia
Speaking about the importance of the Republican vote in the midterm elections, the President referred to the situation surrounding his Supreme Court, taking Brett Kavanaugh.
"All the work we have done will be at stake in November.
We are now just five weeks away from the most important election of our lives.
He said, "This is a very big election - I am not involved, but I am, because I am fighting for all the great candidates.
Trump added, "You can look at this very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very
Furthermore, they are trying to seize power by other necessary means, which you know is futile and pointless.
To get power and control, they don't care who is unhappy, who is worthy, they just want power and control to be there, but we won't let that happen.
The Democrats' campaign is "to resist and obstruct", he said.
"Also, you can see what has happened in the last four days, you have seen the anger of the Democrats and also how mean and bad they are.
He referred to the Senate Judiciary Committee and mentioned the name of the Democrat, Sen. Dianne Feinstein, who was applauded by the audience.
Remember his answer?
Did you leak the document?
What.
No, no, I'm waiting for something -- whose body language was really bad -- body language that I've never seen before.
Working is no longer broad church.
And those who speak according to their own lusts, it is not for them to endure.
When the activists who were pushing my local party forward voted to elect me, it was a big surprise for me.
After all, I am the newest of the Labour MPs whose importance has been greatly diminished - we cannot speak our minds.
It happened to my colleague John Ryan, the MP, because he too had spoken out against socialism.
In my case, Censor Motion denounced me for disagreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
There were similar problems in Europe, on the importance of responsible economic policy, on national security, on which Jeremy disagreed with senior leaders.
The Nottingham East Labour meeting said on Friday that "we want the meeting to be inclusive and productive".
During my eight years as a local Labour MP, I have seen most of the Friday night GC meetings here go exactly the same way.
Sadly, many meetings today fail to agree and promise that the politics of "kind and gentle people" is actually forgotten, as it happened here.
It is obvious that if there are different views in the Labour Party, they are not tolerated and for every opinion a decision is made as to whether it is acceptable to the party leadership or not.
It started right here, right after Jeremy became leader, with colleagues who I had previously thought shared my political views, expecting me to turn around and take positions I would never agree with - whether it's national security or the EU's single market.
Whenever I raise my voice to the public - and it really doesn't matter what I said - I get bad words on social media, sharp comments, condemnation of centre politics and I'm told I'm not worthy of the Labour Party.
And it's not just my experience.
Indeed, I know that I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues because my comments are politically connected.
I know about the way that businesses work and I am dedicated to colleagues who are constantly facing sexual or racial abuse but who do not shy away from speaking up.
There are many frustrating aspects of the current political era, one of which is how to normalize levels of abuse.
Last week Jeremy Corbyn claimed that it was essential for the Labour Party to promote a culture of intolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer the Broad Church and that every motion of "no faith" or change in the party selection rules is very small.
Over the past two years, many people have advised me and urged me to be quiet, not to speak much and then I would be "taken for granted".
But, I did not come into politics for this.
32 years ago when I was involved in the labour movement as a school student, I was incited to oppose the Thatcher government, I was asked to leave my school's extensive classroom altogether, I demanded better public services for those who need them most - whether as a local councillor or a government minister.
I have never hidden any of my politics, including the politics I pursued in the last elections.
There is not a single person in Nottingham East who has any doubts about my policy position and any area of disagreement about my current leadership.
To all those who supported the motion on Friday, I say that I do not think it is worth my time and energy to show my loyalty to the Labour Party when the country is heading towards a Brexit that will damage our homes, businesses and our public services.
But, in fact, I have a message not to Nottingham Momentum, but to my supporters, whether they are Labour or not: I am proud to be serving you and I promise that no choice or political campaign will ever interfere with my work, I am only interested in what is in the best interests of all of you.
Chris Leslie is the MP for Nottingham East.
Ir 38 - 17 Melrose: Ir undefeated reach the top
Two late attempts may have had some effect on the final result, but there is no doubt that Ayr Tennant deserved to win this fine entertaining match of the premiership.
They are now only at the top of the table of ten unbeaten sides.
In the end, their defense was great, they found the best opportunities they could, which led to the home team moving forward and coach Peter Murchy being happy.
"We have tested our game thoroughly and we are still unbeaten, so I have to be happy", he said.
Robin Christie of Melrose said: "The credit goes to Ayr, who made the most of his opportunity".
A 14th-minute attempt by Grant Anderson sent Fraser Climo to the front of the net, but the Warriors gave Scotland's Rory Hughes a yellow card for the game, which allowed Melrose to score and Jason Bagen to make up for the very difficult attempt.
With the help of a penalty just before half-time, Climo extended the air, scoring and then trying to unite the match 17-5 for the air at the break.
But Melrose was better in the second half and Patrick Anderson's effort was converted by Baggot into a goal, which took away five points from Leeway.
After that, Rudih Nott suffered a serious injury that forced him to stop the game for a long time, he was stretched, then after the game started, Ayr went ahead and tried through Stafford McDowall which Climo changed into a goal.
Blair MacPherson, then the captain of the Irish team, was shown a yellow card, and then, at the end of the game, Melrose, under too much pressure, gave a try to the extra man Bruce Colvin, who failed to cash it.
However, the hosts were left behind and when Struon Hutchinson received a yellow card for facing Climo of Bila Ball from the penalty line-out, McPherson made a touchdown by advancing Ayr from behind.
After Kelly Rowe collected David Armstrong's box kick and sent Flanker Gregor Henry away for the home side's fifth attempt, Climo turned it into a goal, as they could if the game resumed.
The game stars are still looking for new careers in the restaurant industry
Game star Ford Kearns is still looking for ways to break into the hospitality industry, having recently revealed that he was chosen to be the director of a licensed restaurant company.
Jack Jarvis, 56, is associated with the popular BBC show, which he writes and co-stars longtime comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
The duo have revealed that the upcoming ninth series will be their last in the show's world, and it seems that they are planning what Kearnyn will do after Craigelange.
Based on the official records list, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment on the story, but a Scottish Sun source hinted that Cairnnon was looking to join a "greater restaurant trade" based in Glasgow.
'We have the right to the sea': land-locked Bolivia hopes the court will reopen the way to the Pacific
The military and navy are patrolling the naval headquarters in La Paz on a massive scale.
Ocean - Blue flags are being waved on government buildings.
From Lake Titicaca to the Amazon, the naval base has one slogan: We have the right to the sea.
It is our duty to find it again.
Bolivia, a coastal state that lost to Chile in a terrible land war in the 19th century, is still desperate to regain its land - it wants to once again wave its flag in the Pacific Ocean.
Now they hope to regain their Bolivian land decades ago, as it awaits a decision from the International Court of Justice on October 1 after five years of deliberations.
"There is a lot of enthusiasm in Bolivia now, there is a sense of unity and peace, and the hope of the people here is that a positive outcome is going to be achieved", said Roberto Calazilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will be watching the big ICJ decision on the big screens across the country, hoping that the verdict from the Hague court will be in favor of Bolivia - which has been negotiating for decades - forcing Chile to negotiate the return of Bolivian land in the sea.
Bolivia's best-known president, Evo Morales - who faces a controversial re-election next year - also welcomed the move in Monday's ruling.
Last August, he said, "We are very close to regaining the Pacific Ocean".
But some analysts believe the court's decision will not be in Bolivia's best interest - and if it is, there will be many conditions.
The UN body in the Netherlands has no authority to reward the Chilean province, and has decided that the possible outcome of the talks will not be determined.
Paz Zarat, Chile's expert at the International Court, said the ICJ's decision comes six months after the last hearing, which indicated that the case was not complicated.
Moreover, unlike the conditions in Bolivia, it seems that over the last four years it may return to the old status quo.
Jarrett said, "The issue of access to the sea has been blocked by the current government of Bolivia. "
He suggested that Morales' controversial statement had destroyed what was left of Chile's goodwill.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to negotiate on some conditions, but it will be very difficult to negotiate this time after the decision.
Since 1962, ambassadors of the two countries have not been in each other 's country.
Bolivia's representative in The Hague, former president Eduardo Rodríguez Velázquez, denied that the court's decision was unusually swift.
He said Monday would be a "great opportunity for Bolivia to open new relations with Chile" and "a chance to end 139 years of disagreements on mutual benefit".
Calazilla has denied that Morales - who is still one of Latin America's most popular presidents - was politicizing the maritime issue.
Bolivia will never back down on its right to access the Pacific Ocean, he said.
Decision is the opportunity to know what we should have done in the past.
North Korea has said it will not stop nuclear inspections until it can trust the United States.
North Korea's Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho has said that his nation will not destroy its nuclear bomb until Washington is trusted.
Ri delivered a speech at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the United States to fulfill the promises made during the Singapore summit between the leaders of the other country.
He commented that US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo seems to be about to resume nuclear diplomacy more than three months after North Korea's Kim Jong Un made promises in Singapore.
Ri said that this is a "pipe dream" that will cause the North to give up on the sanctions and the US objection to the declaration of an end to the Korean War.
Washington is wary of Pyongyang's agreement to a significant disarmament campaign already underway without its declaration.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump want another summit.
But it is entirely doubtful that Pyongyang is serious about ending inspections of the nuclear bomb because they do not want to jeopardize the country's security.
Kim and Trump are planning to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second summit of mutual interest.

Thomas Brown also showed masks with special designs - and these can only be worn in time for Halloween.
The people were astonished to see the many colourful masks and more than the Haute Couture they saw things like Hannibal Lecter.
One creation featured all sorts of scuba diving accessories including snowballs and goggles, while the other featured a melting ice cream cone design.
Besides, if you have seen too much fashion - you are lucky.
Fashion aficionados predict that this fine collection may soon be reaching the best stores around you.
The oversized hat will be available with a Bombay - designed heel, a two - foot - wide brimmed straw hat that everyone from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski can afford.
The best impact hat with the cult label on the back looked pretty cool, another creation posted on social media was the Catwalk - featuring a model wearing a swimsuit on a straw bag.
The burnt orange raffia bag, trimmed with raffia fringes and with a white leather handle, was the highlight of Jacquemus' La Riviera SS19 collection at Paris Fashion Week.
Fashion celebrity Luke Armitage told EFEmail: 'I hope that big hats and beach bags will soon be in stores for the coming summer season - because designers have been so impressed by them that it will be difficult to ignore the demand for large sized accessories.'
John Edward: Language skills are essential for citizens of foreign countries
Private schools in Scotland have a track record of excellent education, and since 2018 have continued to deliver excellent examination results, strengthening individual and collective success in sports, the arts, music and other community endeavours.
Over 30,000 students across Scotland are affiliated with The Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), leading them to provide the best possible service to their students and parents.
Private schools aim to prepare their students for better and higher education, their chosen careers and their places are benefiting citizens of foreign countries.
As an education sector that can design and implement school curricula, we are seeing the continuing selection of modern languages as popular and preferred subject options in schools.
Nelson Mandela once said: "If you talk to a person in a language he understands, you are better for him.
If you speak to him in his own language, it goes very well with him.
When we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries, we feel that we can rely more on English.
In the recent exam results of this year, we can see that languages are at the top of the league table with the highest pass rates in private schools.
68 per cent of them are students who have obtained the highest grade A in foreign languages.
Data collected by 74 SCIS member schools shows that 72 per cent of students achieved the highest grade A in Mandarin, while 72 per cent of students achieved the highest grade A in German, 69 per cent of students achieved the highest grade A in French and 63 per cent of students achieved the highest grade A in Spanish.
This shows that private schools in Scotland are working with foreign languages to give children and young people the skills they will need in the future.
Languages are now being included as an optional subject in the curriculum of private schools and other STEM subjects (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) among others.
A 2014 survey by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills found that employers struggled to fill vacancies, with 17 per cent of candidates lacking language skills.
Therefore, it is becoming imperative for young people to have more and more language skills to prepare them for their future careers.
These skills are essential to work anywhere in the world because of the high potential employment opportunities that language needs.
Regardless of the career option, if people have learned a second language, this kind of skill will definitely benefit them in the future.
If you are able to speak directly to foreigners, being a multilingual person will put you ahead of the competition.
In 2013, a YouGov survey of more than 4,000 adults in the UK found that 75 percent of people could not speak a foreign language well enough, with French the only subject that 15 percent could speak, and the only language to reach double-digit percentages.
This is why it is important to invest in teaching children languages today.
Knowledge of multiple languages, especially those of developing economies, will give children better opportunities to find the right job.
The languages taught in each school in Scotland will be different.
Many schools will also focus on more classical modern languages, while other schools will teach languages that have a vision for 2020 and are considered most important for the UK, for example, Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child's interest in learning a language, he or she will always be able to choose the language in private schools and will be taught by staff who are experts in the field.
Private schools in Scotland are dedicated to providing a learning environment that prepares children for the future and gives them the skills they need to succeed, so that they can move forward in the future.
For the global business environment, it cannot be ruled out that language learning is very important for the future of the country, so it should be given a better place in education.
In fact, modern languages should be accepted as truly 'international communication skills'.
The choice of choice, diversity and excellence for young people in Scotland will continue to be offered by private schools.
It's got to be done.
The Director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools is John Edward
LeBron made his Lakers debut on Sunday in San Diego.
The wait is about to end for LeBron James fans as he is about to play his first game for the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James has been selected as the preseason opener against the Denver Nuggets on Sunday in San Diego.
But, how many minutes they will play is yet to be decided.
The Lakers said via their official website, "They will play at least one minute and at most 48 minutes".
Lakers correspondent Mike Trudell tweeted that James is likely to play for a limited time.
After practice earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers' six-game preseason schedule.
He said, "At this stage of my career, I don't need to prepare for preseason games".
Trump rally in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump held a major campaign rally tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump has scheduled five more rallies next week, including in Tennessee and Mississippi, as well as other favorable locations.
With the suspension on the vote set in his election for appointment to the vacant Supreme Court seat, Trump's goal is to seek support for the upcoming mid-term elections as Republicans risk being out of control of Congress by the time the vote counts in November.
When is Trump's rally in West Virginia tonight and how will you be able to watch it online?
Trump's rally in Wheeling, West Virginia is scheduled for tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018 at 7 pm ET.
You can watch Trump's rally in West Virginia online via live stream on YouTube.
Trump may give a speech at this week's hearing for Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, whose Senate confirmation vote is expected to be delayed for a week while the FIT investigates sexual misconduct charges against Kavanaugh.
But the main goal of the tense atmosphere of the rallies is to help the Republicans cope with the elections in November.
President Trump said during the campaign, "The goal of these five rallies next week is to galvanize volunteers and supporters as part of the Republican effort to protect and increase their blocked majority in the Senate and House of Representatives", according to Reuters.
According to Reuters, a spokesman who was removed from the Trump campaign said, "Control of Congress has become so important to their agenda that the president will only visit states where our campaign season is very busy".
According to the West Virginia Metro News, the rally scheduled for tonight at Wheeling's Westbank Arena may bring the attention of Ohio and Pennsylvania supporters to the Pittsburgh media.
Saturday will be the second time in the past month that Trump has visited West Virginia, the state where he won more than 40 percent of the vote in 2016.
Trump is coming forward to try to help Patrick Morris, the West Virginia Republican candidate who is lagging behind in the Senate poll.
According to Reuters, West Virginia University political scientist Simon Haider said, "If the president is trying to give Morris an edge in the election, it is not a good sign for him".
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA show willingness to compete to keep up with the hopes of finishing on top in the Sunday singles
After three one-sided sessions, the fourth session on Saturday afternoon will be the result of what is going to happen in this Ryder Cup.
The passing of time is a completely new concept for the players, but when which player will come out and which player to trust, it cannot be predicted in competitions like these.
So, what will they say about this momentum now?
Jordan Speeth, as he walked through the day, said, "They had a six-point lead that's now down to four, so I think we're going to have to pick up our pace a little bit".
Of course, Europe took advantage and took 12 points in the game to lead by four points.
According to Spieth, the American feels he has a few chances left and has a lot to encourage, not only from Spieth's form but also from Justin Thomas's form, who played together all day and both scored three out of four points from their game.
The spithee is deadly to everyone from the green to the best in the game.
As his game went on, the crowd cheered and applauded, and when he and Thomas went two points down, he made four all-square important putts.
His putt was the reason his team came in 15th position with the same scream, sort of telling you that you don't think the American team is out of it.
Spieth said, "You really just have to play well and remember that you win. "
This is what all the players who have been out of the game say.
18 holes to make a mark.
The only two players to score more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, who are making new history in the Ryder Cup.
The different but better European couple scored four points out of four and are on top.
On Saturday afternoon, "Mollywood" was the only couple who did not shoot a buggy, but they stayed away from the buggy until Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and before nine o 'clock on Friday morning.
On Sunday, that run and the way he got that run in this big crowd and this big crowd looked like they were the players to beat, and there was no player who could turn a possible victory for a European team into a defeat. It seemed that Le Golf National would be sunset before Fleetwood or Molinari.
It is better that both are on different holes in different ways.
However, the dignity of the European has been discussed for a long time.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson made it a little easier for Foreball's hero Sergio Garcia in the morning, at the time their pairing was made with Alex Noreen.
The Spaniard and Swede holed a bogie and two doubles in front of nine doubles, which they had never reached before.
However, on Sunday there was no one to help you get to your hole.
The foreball and the foresum were great, however, because the interaction between the pairings was so good, they advised that they did not need to take advice and were well acquainted with the strategy of changing the strategy.
As a team, Europe played well and took a significant lead on the final day, but this foreseeable session also showed that Team USA has a competitive edge that is questionable, especially on the Stateside.
Europe leads 10 - 6 on the final day of the Ryder Cup
Europe will take full advantage of the Ryder Cup on Saturday, the final day of the Ryder Cup, after the United States leads 10-6 in the fourball and foursome matches.
The great pair of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari took the lead over struggling Tiger Woods with two wins to put their match well ahead of the four points of Le Golf National.
Thomas Bjorn's European side to avenge their trophy loss two years ago at Hazeltine was dominated by the American side's misfiring in the Morning Fourball, giving them a 3 - 1 lead in the series.
The U. S. put up a strong fight in the forums, winning two matches, but they could not escape defeat.
Jim Furyk's side need eight points in 12 singles matches on Sunday to retain the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to win four consecutive points, while he and Molinari started "Mollywood" after the Sensational Weekend, they are the second pair to win four points in their first four matches in Ryder Cup history.
After beating Woods and Patrick Reid in the foorball, he again beat the best player Woods and American rookie Bryce Deschamps, doing better than ever, by 5 and 4 points.
Woods, who had put himself ahead by two matches on Saturday, showed his best form, but now he has lost 19 of his 29 games of fours and four - somer and seven of his seven in row.
The rest of the morning came with Justin Rose and partner Henrik Stenson back in the foursome and the world 's number one and three Dustin Johnson and Brooks Kopecka beat 2 - 1.
However, on a pleasant, breezy day in the south - west of Paris, Europe had no break.
Three-time major winners Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set the benchmark for the Americans by scoring two points on Saturday.
He won a spectacular 2-1 victory over Spain 's John Rahm and Ian Poulter in the fours and sent Pauls and Rory McIlroy back from the opening two holes 4 - 3.
Only twice in Ryder Cup history has a team come back from a four point deficit to reach the single, although the way it needed to have Fury's side kept the trophy in the spotlight.
However, after two days of second best, Sunday's counter-attack is going to be different from their old game.
North Korea said that by saying "there is no way", disarmament would be the only side that cannot be trusted.
North Korea's foreign minister said Saturday that the United Nations has continued sanctions that were based on its distrust of the United States and showed no way for the country to abandon its nuclear bomb inspection under such circumstances.
Re Yong Ho told the World Body 's Annual General Assembly that North Korea had tried several "major goodwill measures" last year, such as stopping nuclear bomb and missile tests, demolishing nuclear test sites, and promising not to pursue nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
He said, "However, we have not received any response from the US".
"Without any reliance on the US, there will be no reliance on our national security and there is no way in such circumstances that we can begin unilateral disarmament ourselves".
While Ri reiterated that the complaints made by North Korea are about Washington's "phased" approach to disarmament, under which North Korea would gradually gain advantages, his statement made it abundantly clear that this unilateral disarmament cannot be abandoned by one side only, as Pyongyang has done before.
The first was at the June 12 summit between the sitting U.S. president and the North Korean leader in Singapore, where Ri referred to a statement made jointly by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump, when Kim vowed to work toward the "disarmament of the Korean Peninsula" while Trump pledged to guarantee North Korea's security.
North Korea is seeking to formally end the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States says Pyongyang must first stop building its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also opposed calls to end the harsh international sanctions on North Korea.
The US has first emphasised disarmament and raised the level of sanctions pressure to achieve its objective by force, and at the same time, it has objected to "declaring the end of the war", said Ri.
"The idea that confinement can bend us is a pipe dream of those who are ignoring us.
But the problem is that the constant restriction is making us less and less confident.
Ri did not discuss plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump, saying the U.S. leader had spoken last week of the strengths of the United Nations.
Instead, the minister discussed the three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae - in in in the last five months and went on to say: "If the party for this disarmament problem is South Korea and not the U. S., then the disarmament of the Korean peninsula will not be included in such a standoff".
Still, Ri's speech was very different from last year's, when he told the U.N. National Assembly that it was inevitable to target the U.S. mainland with North Korean rockets after "evil president" Trump called "rocket man" on a suicide mission.
At the United Nations this year, Trump, who last year threatened to "totally destroy" North Korea, praised Kim's courage in taking up disarmament but said there was still much work to be done and sanctions would remain in place until North Korea disarmed.
On Wednesday, Trump said he has no timeline for it, "whether it takes two years, three years or five years - it doesn't matter".
China and Russia are debating whether Pyongyang should be rewarded for the steps it takes to the UN Security Council.
However, on Thursday, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the U.N. Security Council that: "The Security Council's sanctions should remain in place until we realize without fail that we are in the process of complete, final and verified disarmament".
The Security Council has increased sanctions on North Korea with full consent in 2006 to fund Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo met Ri at the UN General Assembly and then said he would return to Pyongyang for a second summit next month.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but his last visit was not a success.
He returned from Pyongyang in July and said that work had progressed, only to be denounced within hours by North Korea for "gangster-like demands".
At a moon meeting this month, North Korea vowed to destroy the missile site and, if the United States takes appropriate action, the nuclear complex.
He said Kim had promised him "reasonable measures", he was seeking security guarantees that Trump would take in Singapore and he was moving toward normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard students are studying for jobs that are sufficiently relaxing.
Harvard University has launched a new course this year for all its undergraduates who want to get more and more comfortable while competing in the growing macho culture for study through caffeine-fueled 'all-nights'.
A teacher teaching students at the world 's premier university often has no choice when it comes to such mundane matters as what to do to relax oneself.
Charles Kizzler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and an expert at Brigham and Women's Hospital, has created a course that he believes is the first of its kind in the United States.
After talking about the effects of sleep deprivation during the teaching period, he got the idea to start this course.
He told The Telegraph, 'At the end of the year a girl came to me and said: 'Why do I always say I have to go to the next class next year?'
She said that no one had ever told her about the importance of sleep - which surprised me.
This year, for the first time, students attending this course will learn how good sleep habits are important for academic and athletic performance, as well as improving their overall health.
Paul Barrera, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university's health services, said that students don't get enough sleep every week, which is why the university decided to start the course.
The hour long course includes a series of interactive tasks.
In one section, there will be a picture of a dorm room where students will click on coffee cups, curtains, instructors and books to explain the effects of caffeine and light and how sleep deprivation affects athletic performance, as well as the importance of sleep timing in the routine.
In the second section, participants were told that lack of adequate sleep can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression and cancer.
A map of the campus with interactive icons will be shown, then participants will be encouraged to think about their daily routine.
"We know that this will not change the behaviour of students immediately", said Professor Zessler.
But we believe that they should have the same knowledge about this as we have about the health effects of smoking.
He said that the culture of taking pride in 'learning all night' still exists, modern technology and the increasing pressure on students means that they have to sleep less which has become a growing problem.
Ensuring you get enough and good sleep is the students' secret weapon to combat stress, fatigue and anxiety, he said - and also the weight effects, because lack of sleep keeps their brain thinking about hunger, which makes them feel hungry all the time.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old from California who studied chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Jesler create the course during his last year of classes at Harvard.
He said that the course has made him aware and motivated him to take up the campus-wide course.
In the future, he hopes that completion of this course will be considered mandatory for all postgraduate students before joining a competitive institution.
Professor Geissler suggested that students should consider setting an alarm before going to bed, as well as when they should wake up, and be aware of the harmful effects of blue light from electronic screens and LED lights, which can put too much of a strain on their circadian rhythm and cause sleep problems.
Livingston's against Rangers 1-0: Menga scored against Gerrard
Dolly Menga's strike put the Rangers in trouble in another match, with the responsibility for Livingston's 1-0 win being put on the wrong side of Steven Gerrard.
Ebro side were looking for their first win after a 4-1 win at St Johnstone in February, but Gary Holt's team provoked Gerrard as manager for a second defeat in 18 games to knock out the Landbrooks Premiership leaders Hearts by eight points.
Menga struck for seven minutes before half-time and after that the Rangers' line-up short did not get a chance to even the game.
However, Rangers have now dropped to sixth in the rankings, Livingston has moved to third and is behind only Hibernian due to the goal difference.
Furthermore, the game could be even more troublesome for the Rangers since the head wound of the lineman Calum Spence has been treated since the object was obviously thrown at the other end.
Eight changes made in Gerard's side helped the previous year to reach the semi-finals of the Betfred Cup.
On the other hand, Holt was included in the same Livi 11 that took a point from Hurts last week and the way he drilled so well the opposing team was in trouble at every turn.
The Rangers could have won the match, but Livingston played much better than them.
When Menga took the first late-off to send Scott Pittman to score a goal for Alan McGregor, he should have given him only two minutes, but the midfielder seized this big opportunity he had.
Keegan Jacobs in deep when he got the free kick, the kick went to Captain Craig Halkett, but his defensive partner at the back post, Alan Lithgo, could only get the stabbing wide.
The Rangers got control, but they relied more on hope than on their own game in the final third.
Certainly Alfredo Morelos felt he should have been penalised at the quarter-over mark as he and Steven Lawless had collided with each other, but the referee Steven Thomson had rejected the Colombian's appeal.
Rangers saved two shots on target in the first half, but former Ibro goalkeeper Liam Kelly had to face difficulties from a header by Lassana Kolibli and strikes by Twy OV Azharia.
Although Livy 's opener could have gone against the run of play in the 34th minute, no one can deny that he alone deserves this graft.
Even after this, the Rangers could not beat the best player Jacob had in the deep.
When Deccan Gallagher passed the ball to Scott Robinson, Scott Orfield showed no interest in it, Scott Robinson kept Menga quiet to pick for a simple finish.
Gerrard had taken the break when he swapped Colliable for Ryan Kent and switched to make an immediate impact as he was slotted by the winger in Morelos, but Kelly blocked his line with a fine run.
But, Livingstone showed the visitors the only game they could really enjoy, he swept the long ball with a Lithgo and a Hulket after the long ball.
Holt's side could have extended their lead in the final stage, but McGregor stopped Jacobs from stopping well before Lithgow widened it from the corner.
The Rangers called up Glenn Middleton, who was available as a substitute, he claimed another late for a penalty because he had been involved with Jacobs, but Thompson did not let him succeed again.
Elmanak: inventor of the geyser counter
Now a page from our "Sunday Morning" calendar: 136 years ago today, September 30, 1882 and beyond... the day on which the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiser was born in Germany.
Geyser invented a device that later became known as the Geyser counter for detecting and measuring radioactivity.
The Geyser counter is a mainstay of science, it has become a mainstay of pop culture, as well, in 1950 a film was made on it "Bells of Coronado", in which for the first time the scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans acted:
Man: "What does he do for the world?"
Rogers: "This is a geyser counter used to detect radioactive minerals such as uranium.
After you turn on these earphones, you can definitely hear the effect of the hidden atoms in the minerals because of the radioactivity".
EVAN: "Hey, it's definitely popping right now!"
"Hans" Geiser died in 1945, when he was about 63 years old.
But, because of his invention, his name is still alive.

New cancer vaccines can detect and kill the immune system's bad cells.
The vaccine instructs the immune system to identify the malignant cells during the treatment.
This method can be used to remove and replace immune cells from a patient in a laboratory setting.
Then, they can be screened for a protein that is common to many cancers and then it can be removed and reattached.
A trial for the vaccine is showing promising results in patients with different types of cancer.
A woman was given this vaccine, which revealed the presence of malignant cells in her immune system, and then it was discovered that her ovarian cancer that had been present for over 18 months had been eliminated.
This method can extract and replace a patient's immune cells in the lab, so that they can "see" a common protein found in many cancers called HER2, and then extract and reattach the cells.
"Our results show that this vaccine is very promising", said Professor Jay Berzowski of the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland.
Professor Berzofsky said that HER2 is responsible for the development of many cancers, including breast, ovarian, lung and colorectal cancers.
Removing the immune cells of patients and directing them to detect cancer cells is useful in the treatment of a form of leukemia.
Following his SNL appearance, Kanye West on MAGA Hat condemned Trump's old controversial speech.
It didn't work.
After Kanye West's stunning performance, in which he praised US President Donald Trump and said that he would form a government in 2020, he condemned him in the studio during Saturday Night Live.
After a performance of her third song of the night, Ghost Town, in which she wore a Make America Great Cap, she railed against the Democrats and reiterated her support for Trump.
He said, "So, I talk to white people a lot, and they say, 'What's your reason for liking Trump, he's racist?'"
Still, if I was worried about racism, I would have left America a long time ago.
SNL began the show with a Matt Damon skit in which the Hollywood star poked fun at the Brett Kavanaugh case, it is already known that the Senate Judiciary Committee is already investigating claims of sexual harassment made against her by Christine Blasey Ford.
However, nothing like it was shown, as the footage of West's condemnation was uploaded by comedian Chris Rock on social media.
It was not disclosed whether Rock was trying to make West laugh with the postings because of the post.
At the same time, West complained to the audience that she was threatened to go backstage with her headwear.
"They threatened me backstage.
He said, 'You must not go there wearing that hat.'
They threatened me!
He also said that I was stuck in the wrong place, according to the Washington Examiner.
West said: "You want to see that wrong place?" Also, he said they would "make a play for my Superman cap, because it means you can't tell me what to do. Do you want the world to move on?
Love one another.
He mentioned the audience at least twice in his remarks and the SNL artists were perceived to be embarrassed, with one person telling the publication in a separate report: "The whole studio went completely silent".
West was called in because of the late arrival of singer Ariana Grande, days before Ariana Grande's longtime boyfriend rapper Mac Miller died.
West surprised many audiences by performing the song I Love It, dressed as a perrier bottle.
West was joined by Candace Turner, the head of conservative group TPUSA, who tweeted: "To one of the bravest people: Thank you for speaking out for the people".
But, talk show host Karen Hunter tweeted that West is just "what he said and that's totally amazing".
"But I didn't choose someone who was taking advantage (by buying my music or clothes or supporting my art) of what I felt was promoting a wrong idea for my community or misrepresenting my community.
He is free.
That is why we exist", he said.
Prior to the show, the rapper tweeted that they had changed their name, as well, adding that they were now "formally going to be known as Kanye West".
They are not the first artists to change their names, but before them did Diddie and Puffie, whose old names were respectively Puff Diddie and P. Diddie.
With him, rapper Snoop Dogg had an old name Snoop Lion and the late music legend Prince had also changed his name to Symbol and after that the artist was already known as Prince.
A restaurant in Belfast was the scene of a stabbing attempt.
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after he allegedly stabbed a man in a restaurant in East Belfast on Friday.
Police say the incident took place in Ballyhackmore.
The defence is expected to be presented at Belfast Magistrates Court on Monday.
The charges will be reviewed by the Public Prosecution Service.
Game of Thrones star Kit Harrington has questioned toxic masculinity in the media.
Kit Harrington is best known for his sword-fighting role as Jon Snow in HBO's violent medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones.
But the 31-year-old actor has questioned the role of macho hero, saying that seeing such roles on screen often inspires young boys to think that such hard work is necessary to earn respect.
Speaking to The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said she was feeling 'something wrong' and asked how to tackle the problem of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Recently, Kit married fellow Game of Thrones co-star, 31-year-old Rose Leslie, who he feels feels is "pretty determined" to talk about the problem.
He said, 'Personally, I feel very strongly that we are doing something wrong with masculinity right now.'
Are we teaching men that when they grow up, they will have to deal with the problems we see on the screen?'
Kit feels that television may be partly responsible for toxic masculinity, he attributes it to its overly masculine character.
He added: 'What is done and what is taught?
Do all the things that are taught on TV and in the streets make young boys believe that to be a man, they have to do certain things?
I think it really becomes one of the big questions of our time -- how do we change that?
Because it is obvious that something has gone wrong with the ideas of young men.
In an interview he also admitted that when the Game of Thrones series returns at the end of next summer, he will not participate in any of its prequels or sequels, adding that he has 'made many shows with battlegrounds and horseback riding'.
From November, Kit will be working on a new series of Sam Shepard's True West, which is the story of a film producer whose brother is a crook.
Recently, the actor revealed that the best thing that happened to him from Game of Thrones was meeting his wife, Rose.
He said, "This show has given me my soul mate, so I feel that this show has given me my future family and my life has grown from there".
Rose plays Yegrit, the girlfriend of Kit's character Jon Snow in the Emmy Award winning fantasy series.
In June 2018, the couple married with family consent in Leslie, Scotland.
HIV / AIDS: According to the report, new cases in China have increased by 14%
China has announced that there has been a 14% increase in people living with HIV and AIDS in the country.
Health officials have reported that more than 820,000 people are suffering from the disease across the country.
In the second quarter of 2018 alone, nearly 40,000 new cases were reported.
Given the changes in recent times, most new cases are being attributed to sex.
Traditionally, HIV has spread rapidly in parts of China because of infected blood.
At a conference in Yunnan province, Chinese health officials reported that the number of people infected with HIV through this medium had dropped to near zero.
However, the number of people suffering from HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000 each year.
HIV transmission through sex is a serious problem faced by China's LGBT community.
In 1997, homosexuality was promoted in China, but there is reported to be considerable discrimination against the LGBT community.
Studies have estimated that because of the country's conservative values, 70-90% of men who have sex with men will eventually marry women.
Due to the multiple transmission of the disease, there is insufficient protection for sex in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has tried to solve this problem by promising everyone access to HIV medicine.
Maxine Waters denied that her staff had leaked GOP senator data, calling it a "dangerous lie" and a "method of conspiracy".
U.S. Representative Maxine Waters on Saturday called the allegations unfortunate, saying that one of her employees had posted private information on three Republican U.S. senators on the Wikipedia pages of the lawmaker.
The Los Angeles Democrat claimed that the claims were being investigated by "ultra-right wing" pundits and websites.
Waters tweeted, "Lies, lies and so much more hate".
Reportedly, the information provided included the home addresses and phone numbers of South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham and two Utah Senators, Mike Lee and Orin Hatch.
The information, seen online on Thursday by an unnamed person posted on Capitol Hill, came as a Senate panel hearing on sexual misconduct charges against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh was underway.
Kavanaugh was being questioned over the leak of some information of three senators.
Hill says that the IP addresses that identify the source of the post were traced from conservative sites like Gateway Pundit and RedState, that the source was connected to Waters' office and that a Waters employee had issued the notice.
Waters said, "This allegation is completely unfounded, false and completely false. "
"None of my employees - whose identity, privacy and security are being put at risk because of these false and false allegations - were in any way responsible for the leak of this information.
This allegation is baseless, completely false and utterly false.
Watters soon posted online to purge critics, including the former White House press secretary.
Fletcher wrote, "This rejection is due to anger.
"This shows that he is not the sort of person a member of Congress should be.
When an accusation is made against someone, they should not do so in anger.
They should not become rebels.
They should not question the person who has made the accusations.
They should remain calm and patient.
It appeared that the judge was comparing Fletcher Watters' response to the censure of Kavanaugh's Democrats, whom critics accused of being too angry during Thursday's hearing.
Republican candidate Omar Navarro also tweeted his thoughts on whether to defeat Waters in the midterm elections.
He tweeted, "If this is true, it's a big deal".
In his statement, Watters explained that his office had alerted the appropriate authorities and law enforcement units to these fraud claims.
"We will make sure that the perpetrators are reported and that they are held legally accountable for all the things they have done that are very bad and dangerous to any and all of my employees", he said.
Johnny English Strikes Again review - Rowan Atkinson's spy act was not considered too strong
The importance of Brexit in any new film from a British perspective is still traditionally seen and seems to apply to this revival of the Johnny English action-comedy spoof franchise that began in 2003 with Johnny English and was brought back in 2011 as Johnny English Reborn.
Shall we self - ridicule the way we certainly think it 's nonsense to talk about the nation 's new export opportunities?
At any rate, the pop-minded and rubber-faced incompetent Johnny English has his license to recreate the barefoot thing - which is more famous than anything else by its name alone, it is a widespread comic creation for areas where non-English speakers live.
They are certainly the Daft secret agents who, despite their bizarre pretensions to smooth glamour, managed to show off a little bit more of Mr Bean's dashing clout, and a dolop for the chap who contributed the single note to the charity of the Fire theme tune at the London 2012 Olympics Opening Ceremony.
He is basically a traveller and the International Man of Mystery Atkinson whose role in the Barclaycard TV commercials was forgotten except for the chaos of Wake.
There are only one or two good scenes in this new JE outing.
I loved Johnny English, who wore a medieval suit of armor, climbed into a helicopter, and wrapped a rotor blade around his helmet.
Physical comedy on screen is a gift to Atkinson, but the laughs are low and the comedy is half-baked, especially when the "best" film brands like 007 and Mission Impossible present themselves as a comedy component with full confidence.
The laugh comes as if the comedy is not for adults but for children, and the strange misunderstandings of Johnny English are not at all tolerable to me and I prefer Bean in Atkinson's silent film.
The most relevant thing is that there is a serious crisis in Great Britain.
Britain's most secretive spy network has been hacked by a cyber-hacker, who has put the identities of all agents working in the UK on the network, which could affect the agent's work - a tragic event for Kevin Alden.
This is a great last resort for the rather troubled Prime Minister, who is already struggling with a number of political and unpopularity issues: this Quasi-Teresa-Me character can be played well by Emma Thompson, but the script is not strong enough to work on this script.
His intelligence advisors told him that every active spy had been compromised, he would have to bring in someone who had retired.
In this way, it meant that Johnny English had to fight himself, who is now a schoolmaster at some posh institute, but has to work off the record on what an undercover operative should be: it has some good comedy, plus, the detective has to teach English at the rock-type academy school.
English has been sent back to Emergency Whitehall for briefing and Ben Miller's re-cast is mixed with his old, sore sidekick Boff.
Now Boff is married, he's trying to become a submarine commander, his role is that of a jolie - hockey - stick with Vicky Pepperdine not stuck in it.
So, in His Majesty's Secret Service, Batman and Robin find themselves in some very big trouble when they face Olga Kruelenko's beautiful and famous Ofelia Bulutova.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister is threatened by the charismatic tech billionaire who claims to have the solution to Britain's computer crises: the sinner Jason Volta played Jake Lacy.
English and Bog Farcial begin their odyssey of high-ginks: set a French restaurant on fire while working as waiters; they smuggle through Volta's expensive boat; and English activates complete chaos when he tries to use a virtual reality headset to use the interior of Volta's home.
The film is definitely drawn everywhere for that last sequence, but it's still accurate and entertaining, there's a lot of fun stuff for kids in the whole movie.
Just the middle class.
Furthermore, as I had seen in other Johnny English films, in this film I could not understand whether Rowan Atkinson should be given a role in the British film industry that was truly in keeping with his talent.
Labour has denied that it is planning to work only four days a week for the British people, but will be paid on the basis of five days.
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party is considering a democratic plan that would require British residents to work only four days a week - but get paid for five.
The party is reportedly keen for the company owners to share the savings generated by the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution with workers, so that they can get an extra day off.
This will give the employee three days off in a week - but they will still be able to get the same pay.
Sources say that such an idea would 'fit' with the party's economic agenda and is a plan to benefit the country's workers.
The four - day shift is being promoted by the Trades Union Congress to help workers take advantage of the changing economy.
A senior Labour Party official told The Sunday Times: 'The policy review is likely to be announced before the end of the year.
'This will not happen overnight, but it will require a four - day working week, which is entirely in line with the party 's overall industrial strategy and the party 's vision of rebalancing the economy in favour of the workers.'
The Green Party, which promised a four-day work week during the 2017 general election campaign, would not be the first party to support such an idea.
However, this demand is not fully supported by the Labour Party at present.
A Labour spokesman said: 'The four - day working week is not party policy and is not being considered by the party.'
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell used last week's Labour Conference to present his approach to the socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr McDonnell said he was determined to reclaim power from 'faceless directors' and 'profit - seekers' in utility firms.
The shadow chancellor's plans also mean that existing shareholders in water companies cannot get their full stake back because the Labour government can 'cut' on the basis of alleged wrongdoing.
He also confirmed plans to create an inclusive ownership fund to include employees on company boards and to hand over 10 per cent equity of private sector firms to employees, who can receive an annual dividend of up to £500.
Lindsey Graham tells John Kennedy on "60 Minutes" whether the FBI investigation into Kavanaugh will change his mind.
The FBI investigation into the allegations against Judge Brett Cavanagh delayed the final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court by at least a week, and the question arises whether the bureau's findings helped any Republican senator withdraw his support.
In an interview aired Sunday, "60 Minutes" correspondent Scott Paley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if there was any possibility of the FBI finding something that would cause them to change their minds.
Kennedy looked more pale than his South Carolina counterpart.
"I think, of course", said Kennedy.
"I said that I had spoken to Judge Kavanaugh on my way to the hearing.
After that, when the allegation came out, I called them, asked, 'Did you do this?'
He was sure, determined, clear".
Graham's vote, however, seemed to be a stone 's throw.
"I had made up my mind about Brett Cavanagh and that would have required an explosive charge", he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I do know this: Brett vehemently denied", Graham continued, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And whatever they called him, he could not verify it.
This is 36 years old.
I don't see any change".
What is the Global Citizen Festival and has it reduced poverty?
This Saturday, New York hosts the Global Citizen Festival, an annual concert featuring some of the most influential stars in the world, and equally impressive is its mission to end world poverty.
Now in its seventh year, the Global Citizen Festival will bring tens of thousands of people to Central Park's Great Lawn to not only enjoy acts like Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also raise awareness of the true goal of the program to end extreme poverty by 2030.
Launched in 2012, the Global Citizen Festival is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international advocacy group that hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
To get free tickets to the event (unless you are willing to pay for a VIP ticket), concertgoers must complete a series of "actions" such as volunteering, emailing a world leader, making a phone call, or other meaningful ways to help raise awareness of their goal of ending poverty.
But how successful has Global Citizen been in achieving its goal in the last 12 years?
Is the idea of rewarding people with free concerts the right way to convince people to call for action, or is it just another case of so-called "clicktivism" - making people feel like they're actually making a difference by signing an online petition or tweeting?
Since 2011, Global Citizen says it has recorded more than 19 million "actions" from its supporters, advancing efforts toward various goals.
It says these actions have helped world leaders announce commitments and policies worth more than $37 billion set to impact the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group cited 390 commitments and declarations resulting from its actions, of which at least $10 billion has already been distributed or is about to be raised.
The group estimates that the Safe Fund has directly impacted approximately 649 million people worldwide to date.
Some of the major commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a partnership of UK-based investors and implementers, which pledged to provide $35 million to Rwanda to end malnutrition in the county after receiving over 4,700 tweets from global citizens promising to "help children grow to their full potential".
During a live concert in London in April 2018, Power of Nutrition Ambassador Tracey Ullman told the crowd, "With the help of the UK government, donors, national governments, and global citizens like you, we can make the social injustice of malnutrition a footnote in history".
The group also said that after more than 5,000 actions calling for the UK to improve nutrition for mothers and children, the government announced funding for a project called Power of Nutrition, which will reach 5 million women and children with nutrition interventions.
In response to a question that is often asked on your website, "Why do you think we can end extreme poverty?"
Global Citizen replied: "It will be a long and hard road - sometimes we will fall and fail.
But, as with the great civil rights and anti-apartheid movements before us, we will succeed, because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, The Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monae are among the few performers to perform at this year's event in New York, which will be hosted by Debra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
US could use Navy to "blockade" to hamper Russian energy exports - Home Secretary
Citing the Washington Examiner, Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke revealed that Washington could resort to the US Navy "if necessary" to block Russian energy in US markets, including the Middle East.
Zinke charged that Russia's work in Syria - especially where it is operating at the invitation of the legitimate government - is a pretext for exploring new energy markets.
He reportedly said that "the reason for their presence in the Middle East is that they want to broker energy, as they have done in the southern regions of Europe, in Eastern Europe.
And, according to the official, there are ways and means to deal with it.
"The United States has the ability with our Navy to ensure that sea lanes remain open, and, if necessary, blockade, to ensure that their energy does not go to market", he said.
Zinke was addressing attendees at an event organized by the Consumers Energy Alliance, a nonprofit group that calls itself "the voice of energy consumers" in the United States.
He compared Washington's approach to dealing with Russia and Iran, saying they were effectively identical.
Referring to Russia as a "trickle-down economy" with a reliance on fossil fuels, he said, "The economic alternative in the case of Iran and Russia is, more or less, to take advantage of and substitute for fossil fuels".
There have been statements that the Trump administration, taking Russia's place, is on a mission to promote its liquefied natural gas exports to Europe as the cheapest option for European consumers.
To that extent, Trump administration officials, including US President Donald Trump himself, have tried to convince Germany to pull out of the "unreasonable" Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which, according to Trump, has made Berlin a "captive" of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly insisted that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which is set to double the existing pipeline capacity by 110 billion cubic meters, is purely an economic project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington's widespread opposition to the project is motivated purely by economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said after a meeting with US Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September, "I believe we share the view that energy cannot be a means of pressure and consumers should be able to choose suppliers".
The US stance was opposed by Germany, which has reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany's leading industry organization, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has called on the US to stay out of EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
Dieter Kempf, head of the Federation of German Industries (BDI), said after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin, "I have a big problem when a big state interferes with our energy supply.
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren will "seriously consider" running for president in 2020, said
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said Saturday that she would "seriously consider" running for president after the midterm elections.
During a town hall in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she would consider running in the race.
According to The Hill, she said, "It's time for women to go to Washington and reassemble our broken government and that includes having a woman in the top job".
"After November 6, I will seriously consider running for president".
Warren, assessing President Donald Trump during a town hall, said, "They're taking this county in the wrong direction.
"I am deeply concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy", he said.
Warren has been vocal in her criticism of Trump and his Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said "Of course we need to have the FBI investigate before the vote".
However, a poll released on Thursday showed that most constituents of Warren do not think he should run in the 2020 election.
According to a Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe poll, ninety-eight percent of Massachusetts "potential" voters said the senator should not run.
Thirty - two per cent supported contesting the election in this way.
The poll showed the most support for former Governor Deval Patrick running, with 38 percent supporting his possible inclusion in the race and 48 percent against it.
Other high-profile Democratic names being discussed for potentially running in 2020 include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would officially make a decision by January, the Associated Press reported.
Sarah Palin, at the rally for Donald Trump, cites Palin's PTSD
Track Paulin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after enlisting in the Army in September.
He was arrested in a domestic violence incident on Monday night.
At a rally for Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma, she told the audience, "Because of what my own son is going through, what he feels after coming back, I feel for other families who feel the effects of PTSD and know the wounds our soldiers come back with".
Palin called his arrest "the elephant in the room", and said of his son and other retired soldiers, "They come back with a little change, they come back as tough, they come back wondering if this honor is for what their fellow soldiers and airmen, and every other member of the military, have sacrificed for the country".
According to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department, he was arrested in Wasilla, Alaska, on Monday and charged with domestic violence and possessing a weapon while intoxicated.
18 states, D.C. support the challenge of a new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia are backing a legal challenge to a new U.S. policy that denies asylum to gang escapees or victims of domestic violence.
Representatives from 18 states and the District filed a pro-justice brief in Washington on Friday to support a refugee who challenged the policy, NBC News reported.
The full name of the plaintiff in the federal lawsuit against Grace v. Sessions, filed by the American Civil Liberties Union in August, is not disclosed.
She said that her companions "and her violent gang members' sons" abused her, but US officials denied her request for asylum on 20 July.
He was taken into custody in Texas.
Government lawyers supporting Grace described El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala as nations facing widespread problems of gang and domestic violence, which generate large numbers of applicants for U.S. asylum.
The new U.S. asylum policy reversed a 2014 ruling by the Board of Immigrant Appeals that allowed undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
District of Columbia Attorney General Carl Reesine said in a statement Friday that the new policy "disregards decades of state, federal and international law".
"Federal law requires that all asylum claims must be adjudicated on the basis of the particular facts and circumstances of the claim, and such a barrier violates that principle", Justice Friend said.
The attorney further argued in the brief that the policy of denying immigrants entry harms the U.S. economy by saying that they are more likely to become entrepreneurs and "supply essential labor".
Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges in June not to grant asylum to victims of domestic abuse and gang violence.
In its June 11 policy statement, Sessions said, "Asylum is available to those who leave their homeland because of persecution or fear because of their race, religion, nationality, or membership of a particular social group".
Refuge was never meant to alleviate all the problems - even all the serious problems - that people around the world face every day.
A desperate rescue effort in Palu, as the death toll in the race to find survivors doubled.
For the survivors, the situation was extremely dire.
"It feels very stressful", said Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, comforting a child with a fever at an evacuation center in the city of Tahsin-Nahas Palu.
"Every minute an ambulance brings in the bodies.
Clean water is scarce".
Residents were seen returning to their destroyed homes, picking up their burned belongings, trying to save whatever they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals were flooded in the wake of the 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
Some of the wounded, including Dewey Harris, who suffered a broken back and shoulder, rested outside the military hospital in Palu, where patients were being treated outdoors due to the continuous strong earthquake shocks.
He felt the violent tremors in his fifth - floor hotel room, which he shared with his wife and daughter, and his eyes filled with tears.
"We didn't have time to save ourselves.
I think I was buried in the rubble of the wall", Harris told the Associated Press, adding that his family was in town for the wedding.
"I heard my wife crying for help, but then silence.
I don't know what happened to her and my baby.
I hope they're safe".
US Ambassador accuses China of 'bullying' through 'propaganda'
A week after a four-page advert in a US daily newspaper by the state-run Chinese newspaper, citing the mutual benefits of US-China trade, the US ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the US press to spread propaganda.
US President Donald Trump last Wednesday - after accusing China of trying to interfere in the November 6 congressional elections - referred to the paid supplement of the China Daily in Iowa's best-selling newspaper, the Des Moines Register, which China denies.
Trump's allegation that Beijing was trying to interfere in the US elections was a new stage in Washington's campaign to pressure China, US officials told Reuters.
While it is common for foreign governments to advertise to boost trade, Beijing and Washington are currently engaged in a growing trade war that has seen them impose tariffs on each other's imports.
Chinese and U.S. experts say China's retaliatory tariffs in the trade war were designed to hit exporters in states like Iowa, which had supported Trump's Republican Party.
Terry Branstad, the US ambassador to China and longtime former governor of Iowa, the leading exporter of agricultural goods to China, said Beijing has hurt American workers, farmers and businesses.
Bransted expressed his opinion in Sunday's Des Moines Register, writing that China is "now doubling down on that bully by running propaganda ads in our own free press".
"In its propaganda, the Chinese government is taking advantage of America's cherished tradition of free speech and independent journalism by placing paid ads in the Des Moines Register", Bransted wrote.
"Given that the media is locked into the strong fist of the Chinese Communist Party, in contrast, here at the roadside newsstand in Beijing, you will find limited dissatisfied voices and no true reflection of the disunited opinions that Chinese people may have on China's worrisome economic curve", he wrote.
He said that "one of China's most prominent newspapers declined to publish his article", though he did not name the newspaper.
With Kavanaugh's defeat, Republicans are isolating female voters ahead of the midterm elections, analysts warn.
As top Republicans support and defend Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh, who faces multiple allegations of sexual harassment, analysts warn that they will see a backlash during the upcoming midterm elections, especially from women.
The emotions around this are quite intense, and most Republicans are already on record showing that they want to go ahead with the vote.
There's no going back on those things", Grant Reehr, a professor of political science at the Maxwell School at Syracuse University, told The Hill for an article published Saturday.
Reehr said he doubted that the last-minute push by Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona) for an FBI investigation would be enough to calm angry voters.
According to a Washington, D.C., newspaper, on Friday Carine Jean-Pierre, a senior adviser and national spokesperson for the progressive group MoveOn, said, "Women cannot forget what happened yesterday - nor can those who are coming forget it tomorrow or in November".
On Friday morning, when Republicans controlling the Judiciary Committee wanted to move forward with Kavanaugh's nomination despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, protesters demonstrating in the Senate lobby chanted "November is coming!", Mick reported.
"Democratic enthusiasm and motivation are going to fall off the charts", said Stu Rothenberg, a non-political analyst, to the news site.
"People are saying it's already huge; it's true.
But it could be more, especially among women voters in suburbs and younger voters aged 18 to 29, who don't vote often when they don't like the president".
Before the public testimony detailing the allegations of sexual harassment by Ford against the Supreme Court nominee, analysts said it was likely to be contested if Republicans move forward with the confirmation.
"It's become a confusing mess for the GOP", said Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, according to NBC News.
"It's not just about the committee vote or the final vote or putting Kavanaugh on the bench, it's also about how the Republicans have handled it and how they've treated him", Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, an organization that helps Democrats in the election, told the News Channel.
However, Americans seem somewhat divided on who to believe in light of the testimony of Ford and Kavanaugh, most of whom appear to be in favor of Kavanaugh.
A new YouGov survey shows that 41 percent of respondents definitely or potentially believed Ford's testimony, while 35 percent said they definitely or potentially believed Cavana.
In addition, 38 percent said they thought Cavana probably or definitely lied during his testimony, while only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
Following pressure from Flake, the FBI is currently investigating allegations made by Ford as well as, at least one other defendant, Deborah Ramirez, The Guardian reported.
Ford testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee last week under oath that Kavanaugh beat him while he was drunk at age 17.
Ramirez alleges that the Supreme Court nominee displayed his genitals when he joined a party while studying at Yale in 1980.
The inventor of the World Wide Web is planning to launch a new Internet to rival Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, has started a startup that wants to rival Facebook, Amazon and Google.
Technology Legend's latest project, Inrupt, is a company that builds on Berners-Lee's open source platform called Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and which people will be allowed to access what information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the intention behind Inrupt is to achieve "world domination".
"We have to do it now", he said of startups.
"This is a historic moment".
The app uses Solid's technology to allow people to create their own "personal online data store" or POD.
This can include contact lists, to - do lists, calendars, music library and other personal and business tools.
It's as if Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify are all available on one browser and at the same time.
The unique thing about personal online data store is that it is entirely up to the user who can access what kind of information.
The company calls it "personal empowerment through data".
According to the company's CEO John Bruce, the idea of Inrupt is to bring the resources, processes and appropriate skills by the company to make Solid available to everyone.
Currently the company consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM, a few on-staff developers contracted to work on the project, and a community of volunteer coders.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world can create their own decentralized apps using tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team "are not talking to Facebook and Google about whether to initiate a complete transformation, where all their business models will be completely destroyed overnight.
"We are not asking for permission from them".
In a post on Medium published Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt's "mission is to provide commercial energy and ecosystems to help protect the integrity and quality of the new web built on Solid.
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the net neutrality debate.
Even as Inrupt launches, Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation, and the Open Data Institute.
"I am incredibly optimistic for this next era of the Web", said Berners-Lee.
Bernard Vaughn: WW1 Victoria Cross Cleric celebrated with a
The only Church of England clergyman to win the Victoria Cross as a soldier during the First World War was celebrated in his home town.
Lieutenant Colonel Reverend Bernard Vaughn won the award in the attack at Belenglais and Lehaucorte on 29 September 1918.
However, he was killed by a sniper four days later and never knew that he had won the highest British military honour.
The memorial stone was unveiled by two of his grandsons at a parade held in Rushden, Northamptonshire on Saturday.
One of his grandsons, Michael Vaughan, said it was "splendidly symbolic" that the plaque was being unveiled exactly 100 years after his grandfather won the award.
According to the London Gazette, on 29 September 1918 Lt. Col. Vaughn led his battalion into the Canal de Saint-Quentin "in the midst of a very dense fog, under heavy shelling and machine guns on the battlefield".
He then moved towards the firing line and with "great courage" led the army line and routed three detachments before taking the field gun alone.
Lieutenant Colonel von was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918 - just a month before the war ended.
Michael Vaughan, 72, said that his grandfather's accomplishments "were something I know I could never match, but something we have a fondness for".
He and his brother Dr. James Vaughn also performed the wreath-laying after the parade, which was led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vaughn said he was "very honoured to play a role in the parade" and said "the support being given by so many is a demonstration of the heroism of a true hero".
MMA fans stayed up all night to watch Bellator 206, but instead they got Peppa Pig
Imagine staying up all night to watch the glitzy Bellator 206, but missing the main event.
The San Jose bill featured 13 matches, including six on the main card and being shown live all night on U.K. Channel 5.
At 6am, just as Gerard Moussaci and Rory McDonald were preparing to face off, the UK audience was stunned by the coverage's transformation into Peppa Pig.
Some were extremely disappointed, especially after staying up until dawn for the match.
One fan on Twitter described the switch to children's cartoons as "a kind of sick joke".
When asked about the broadcast, Bellator senior vice president Dave Schwartz said, "This was not appropriate for 6am hours as per government regulation, so they had to switch to children's programming".
"Pepa the Pig", yeah.
Bellator Company president Scott Cocker said they are going to work on their scheduling to include UK audiences in the future.
"I think when I think about the replay, I think we might find a solution", said Cocker.
"But there it will be six o'clock Sunday morning and we will not be able to work on it until Sunday, our time, Monday their time.
But we are working on it.
Believe me, when this change happened, there was a lot of text traffic going on and not all of it was favorable.
We were trying to fix it, we thought it was some technical glitch.
But it was not, it was a government issue.
I can promise you that it won't happen next time.
We'll limit it to five matches instead of six - as we usually do - and when we tried to deliver something more for the fans, it was just a little bit too much.
This is an unfortunate situation".
Tom Daley felt "deprived" in terms of sexuality
Olympic diver Tom Daley says he became obsessed with feeling inferior to everyone because of his sexuality - but that it inspired him to succeed.
Daly, 24, said he didn't realize until he was in high school that "not everyone is like me".
Speaking on the first Radio 4 Desert Island Disc presented by Lauren Laverne, she said she speaks about gay rights to give others "hope".
He also said that after becoming a father, he was less concerned about winning the Olympics.
The long-running show's regular presenter, Kirstie Young, has taken several months off due to illness.
Upon Laverne's first appearance on the show as a sociopath, Daly said she was feeling "less" than everyone else because "liking boys and girls was not socially acceptable".
She said, "Even today, those feelings of inferiority and of being different are the very things that give me the strength and the power to be able to succeed".
He wanted to prove that he was "special", he said, so as not to disappoint everyone when they finally found out about his sexuality.
The two-time Olympic bronze medalist has become a high-profile LGBT campaigner and used his presence at this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to appeal to more countries to reduce homosexuality.
He said he spoke out because he felt lucky to be able to live out his life without any hassles and he wanted to give others "hope".
The three-time world champion said that when she fell in love with a man - American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom she met in 2013 - "I was surprised".
Daly married the Oscar winner, who is 20 years older than her, but she said the age gap was never an issue.
"When you go through so many experiences at such a young age" - he went to his first Olympics at the age of 14 and his father died of cancer three years later - he said that it was hard to find someone of his age who went through the same ups and downs at such a young age.
In June the couple became parents to a son named Robert Ray Black - Daly, and Daly said that his "entire outlook" had changed.
"If you had asked me last year, it would have been all about 'I need to win the gold medal'", he said.
"You know, there are more things than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robby".
Their son bears the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daly said that his father did not accept that he was going to die and the last thing he wanted to know was whether he had tickets for London 2012 - because he wanted to sit in the front row.
She said, "I couldn't tell them you weren't going to be sitting in the front row, Dad".
He said, "When they couldn't breathe, I held their hands and held them until their breath stopped and they died, and then I thought they were not invincible".
The following year, Daly participated in the 2012 Olympics and won the bronze medal.
"All I knew was that this was what I had dreamed of all my life - to dive in front of a hometown crowd at the Olympic Games, there was no better feeling", she said.
It also inspired his favourite first song - Proud by Heather Small - which echoed with him during the Olympic preparations and still makes his ears stand up.
The Desert Island Disc will be broadcast on BBC Radio 4 on Sundays at 11:15 BST.
Out of form Mickelson out of the Ryder Cup on Saturday
American Phil Mickelson will set records on Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup match, but he will have to change his form to avoid this unfortunate milestone.
Playing in the biennial event for a record 12th time, Mickelson was ejected from the game by captain Jim Furyk for Saturday's fourballs and forums.
Instead of becoming the centre of attraction, as he has often been for the United States, the five-time major winner spent his days living among cheerleaders and working on hopes of improving the weaknesses of his playing style.
Never a straight driver at the peak of his career, the 48 - year - old was not a perfect fit for the Taite Le Golf National Course, where long periods of inactivity are routinely punished by a miss.
And where the course itself isn't so easy, in Sunday's ninth match, Mickelson will face British Open champion Francesco Molinari, who has teamed up with rookie Tommy Fleetwood to win all four of his matches this week.
If the American players, who started 12 singles matches four points down, start strong, then Mikkelsen's match could prove to be quite significant.
Furyk trusted his man, not that he could say anything else.
"They understood their role completely, patted me on the back and hugged me and said they would be ready tomorrow", Furyk said.
"He has a lot of confidence.
He's a Hall of Famer and he's contributed a lot to these teams in the past and this week.
I probably didn 't imagine him playing two matches.
I had imagined more, but it worked the way it did and the way we thought we had to go.
He wants to go out there like everybody else".
Mickelson will surpass Nick Faldo's record for most Ryder Cup matches played on Sunday.
This Ryder Cup could mark the end of a career that has never touched the heights of his personal best.
Mikkelsen has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven halves, although Furyk said his presence brings some intimacy to the team.
"He's funny, he's sarcastic, he's present, he likes to make fun of people, and his presence in the team room is special", he explained.
"I think the young players also enjoyed going to him this week, which was fun to watch.
He gives so much more than just play".
Captain Thomas Bjorn of Europe knows that the great advantage may soon be gone.
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knows from experience that a big lead in the last day's singles at the Ryder Cup can easily turn into an awkward move.
Dan made his debut in a 1997 match at Valderrama, where a side captained by Siv Balesteros had a five-point lead over the Americans, but with a win of 141⁄2-131⁄2, the lowest margin, had just reached the finish line.
"You keep reminding yourself that we had a big lead in Valdrama; we had a big lead in Brooklyn, where we lost, and in Valdrama, we just won", Bjorn said, after watching the Class of 2018 go 5-3 on Friday and 10-6 at Golf National until yesterday, with his mind on the job.
So history will show me and all the people on that team that this is not over.
You will pay the full price tomorrow.
Get out there and do all the right things.
It 's not over until you get the points on the board.
We have one goal, and that is to try and win this trophy and that's where we have to stay focused.
I've always said, I focus on the 12 players who are on our side, but we are well aware that the greatest players in the world are on the other side".
Bjorn went on to say how his players performed on the difficult golf course: "I will never be able to outdo myself in this.
Tomorrow is a different hard time.
Tomorrow the individual demonstrations will come up, and that's a different matter.
It's great to go there with a partner when everything is going well, but when you go out there in person, your ability as a golfer is put to the test.
This is the message you need to get across to the players to show their best tomorrow.
Now, you leave your partner behind and he has to go and do his best".
Unlike Bjorn, opposite Jim Furyk would have wished for his players to perform individually better than they did as partners, with the exception of Jordan Speeth and Justin Thomas, who scored three out of four.
Having been part of the winning team in Brooklyn, Furich himself has been on both ends of the reversal of those final days, before being defeated by Europe's "miracle in Medina".
"I remember every word of it", he said in response to a question about how captain Ben Crenshaw handled his players on the last day in 1999.
We have 12 important games tomorrow, but you want to start as fast as you saw in Brooklyn, as you saw in Medina.
When this movement is one-way, it puts a lot of pressure on the matches between them.
We set up our lineup and brought people in, as we felt, you know, we're trying to do some more magic tomorrow".
Thomas has been tasked with trying to lead a counterattack with Rory McLaren in the top match, where Paul Casey, Justin Rose, John Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter are the other top half of the European order.
"I grouped them in this order because I think it covers them all", Bjorn said of his solo selections.
The new German battleship was again delayed.
The new German Navy warships were supposed to be commissioned in 2014 to replace the age-defying Cold War-era warships, but due to faulty systems and rapidly rising costs, that won't happen until at least next year, local media reported.
According to a military spokesman quoted by Die Zeit, the commissioning of the "Reinland-Pfalz", the flagship of the brand new Baden-Württemberg-class battleships, has now been postponed until the first half of 2019.
The vessel was supposed to have joined the Navy in 2014, but troubling issues after delivery affected the fate of the ambitious project.
The four Baden-Württemberg class ships were ordered by the Navy back in 2007 to replace the ageing Bremen class warships.
It is understood that they will facilitate powerful artillery, an array of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, as well as some stealth technology such as low radar, infrared and acoustic divisions.
Other important features include extended maintenance period - it is possible to deploy the latest warships from indigenous ports for up to two years.
However, continued delays mean that state-of-the-art warships - which could give Germany the opportunity to power projects abroad - will be obsolete by the time they enter service, Dzeijn commented.
The F125 battleship made headlines last year when the German Navy officially refused to commission the vessel and returned it to the Blohm and Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time that the Navy had returned a ship to the shipbuilder after delivery.
Few people knew the reasons for the withdrawal, but the German media cited several important "software and hardware defects" that rendered the battleship useless when deployed on a combat mission.
The software shortcomings were especially significant as the Baden - Württemberg - class ships will be manned by a crew of some 120 sailors - just half the manpower of the older Bremen - class battleships.
In addition, it emerged that the ship is dramatically overweight which reduces its performance and limits the Navy's ability to add future upgrades.
The 7,000 tonne "Rhineland - Pfalz" is considered to be twice as heavy as the ships of the same class used by the Germans in the Second World War.
Apart from the faulty hardware, the price tag of the entire project - including the training of the crew - is becoming an issue.
It is said to have reached €3.1 billion ($3.6bn) from an initial €2.2 billion.
The problem of new warships, which has become especially important in the light of recent warnings, is holding back Germany 's naval power.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German parliament's defence committee, admitted that the navy was actually "running out of deployment-capable ships".
The official said that over time the issue has become critical as old ships were decommissioned but no replacement vessels were made available.
He said that none of the Baden-Wurttemberg-class warships were able to join the Navy.
The National Trust is eavesdropping on the secret lives of bats.
New research being carried out at an estate in the Scottish Highlands aims to reveal how bats use the natural landscape in their hunt for food.
It is hoped that the findings will shed new light on the behavior of the unique flying mammals and help guide future conservation activities.
The study, carried out by scientists from the National Trust for Scotland, will follow the common and soprano pipistrelles as well as the long-eared brown and resident Dobbenton bats in Inverway Gardens, Weston Ross.
Special recorders will be installed at key locations around the property to track the bat movements throughout the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also carry out mobile surveys using handheld detectors.
Expert sound analysis of all the recordings reveals the frequency of the bat calls and what species are doing.
A detailed landscape - scale map and report of their behaviour will then be prepared.
Rob Dewar, NTS's nature conservation consultant, hopes the results will reveal which areas of natural habitat are most important to bats and how they are used by each species.
This information will help in determining the benefits of natural - habitat management actions such as the creation of grassland and how to maintain well - maintained woodlands for bats and other related species.
In Scotland and throughout the UK, the bat population has declined dramatically over the last century.
They are threatened by construction and development works, which affect bird nests and damage natural habitat.
Wind turbines and lighting systems can also pose risks, as some chemical treatments of flypaper and building materials, as well as attacks by pet cats, can also pose a risk.
Bats are not actually blind.
However, due to their hunting habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They use a sophisticated echolocation technique to point out faults and obstacles in their flight path.
The NTS, which is responsible for the care of over 270 historic buildings, 38 important parks and 76,000 hectares of land across the country, takes the bat very seriously.
It has ten trained experts who regularly survey, inspect the bird stations and sometimes rescue them.
The organisation has established Scotland's first and only dedicated bat reserve in the Threve Estate in Dumfries and Galloway, Scotland, home to eight of Scotland's ten bat species.
Estate manager David Thompson says that the estate is the perfect place for him.
"We have a good area for bats here in Threve", he said.
We have old buildings, many old trees and all the good natural habitats.
But there's still a lot that's unknown about bats, so the work we're doing here and on other properties will help us understand what they need to thrive".
They stress the importance of bat inspection before maintenance within the properties as it is possible that 400 females and infants may be destroyed by the unintentional destruction of the maternity maternity shelter, possibly wiping out the entire local population.
Bats are protected and it is illegal to kill, harass or harass them or destroy their habitats.
Elizabeth Farrell, Scottish officer for the Bat Conservation Trust, has encouraged the public to come forward to help.
"We still have a lot to learn about our bats and many of our species, and we still don't know how their populations are growing", he said.
Ronaldo denied the rape allegations while lawyers sued the German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo has called the rape allegations against him "fake news", saying that people want to "promote themselves" by using his name.
His lawyers are about to sue the German newspaper Der Spiegel, which published the allegations.
The Portugal and Juventus forward is accused of raping an American woman named Catherine Mayorga in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2009.
Derr Spiegel reported Friday that he allegedly paid the woman $375,000 to keep quiet about the incident.
Addressing his 142 million followers in an Instagram live video after the reporting of the claims, Ronaldo, 33, called the reports "fake news".
"No, no, no, no, no. I was just saying,
What he said today is fake news", the five-time Ballon d'Or winner said on camera.
"They want to promote themselves using my name.
This is normal.
They want to be popular with my name, but that's part of their job.
I am a happy person and all is well, " the player said with a smile.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue der Spiegel for charges that they have called "suspiciously invalid reporting in the area of confidentiality", according to Reuters.
Lawyer Christian Schertz said that the players will seek "compensation for moral damages in an amount commensurate with the gravity of the violation, which is probably one of the most serious violations of individual rights in recent years".
The alleged incident is said to have occurred in June 2009 in a suite at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
According to papers filed in Clark County District Court in Nevada, after meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga allegedly returned to the player's room, where they allegedly raped her.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo fell to his knees after the alleged incident and told him that he was "99 percent" a "good person" who had been let down by "one percent".
The documents claim that Ronaldo confirmed that the pair had sex, but that it was consensual.
Majorga also claims that she went to the police and even took pictures of her injuries at a hospital, but later agreed to an out-of-court settlement because she felt "panicked by retaliation" and was worried about being "publicly humiliated".
The 34-year-old says she is now trying to end the agreement because the harassment has continued since the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was on the verge of joining Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the alleged attack, and this summer signed a €100 million deal with Italian giants Juve.
Brexit: UK 'will always regret' the loss of its carmaker
Trade Secretary Greg Clarke said the UK would "regret forever" if it lost its position as the world leader in car manufacturing after Brexit.
He said Toyota UK had told the BBC that it would temporarily halt production at its factory in Barnstone, near Derby, if Britain left the EU.
"We need a deal", said Mr. Clark.
The Japanese automaker said the border delay could impact jobs in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
The Barnstone plant - which makes Toyota's Auris and Avensis - produced about 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
Marvin Cook, managing director of Toyota in Barnstone, said, "I believe that if the UK leaves the European Union at the end of March, we will stop production at our factory".
Other UK carmakers have expressed fears about leaving the EU without agreement on how cross-border trade will work, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
For example, BMW says it will close its mini plant in Oxford for a month after Brexit.
The main concerns, according to the car manufacturers, relate to supply chain risks in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota's production line runs on a "just-in-time" basis, with parts coming in made-to-order every 37 minutes from suppliers in both the UK and the EU.
If the U.K. leaves the European Union on March 29 without a deal, there could be disruption at the border, according to the industry, which could cause delays and spare parts shortages.
The company said that it would be impossible for Toyota to maintain more than one day's inventory at its Derbyshire plant, so production would be halted.
Mr. Clark said that Theresa May's Chequers plan for future relations with the EU "has been calibrated purely to avoid those checks at the border".
"We need a deal. We want the best deal that I think not only allows us to enjoy success now, but is also essential to achieving this opportunity", he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.
"There is evidence from not only Toyota but other manufacturers that we should be able to fully continue what has been a highly successful set of supply chains".
Toyota was unable to say how long production would be halted, but warned that in the long run, the extra cost would reduce the plant's competitiveness and eventually drive jobs away.
Peter Sauvallaris, who has worked at Barnstone for 24 years and is the union coordinator for Unite at the plant, said his members are extremely worried: "In my experience, once these jobs are gone, they never come back.
A government spokesman said: "We have put forward a precise and credible plan for our future relations with the European Union".
According to the White House, Trump 's meeting with Rosenstein may be delayed again
The White House said Sunday that Donald Trump's high-stakes meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be postponed "for another week later" as Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanagh's struggle continues.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian election interference, ties between Trump aides and Russia, and potential obstruction of justice by the president.
Whether or not Trump will fire the deputy attorney general, and thus put Mueller's freedom at risk, has fueled the Washington rumor mill for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein wired Trump to record the conversation and discussed the possibility of removing the president through the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denied the report.
But last Monday, he went to the White House amidst these reports that he was going to resign.
Instead, a meeting was announced Thursday with Trump, who was then at the United Nations in New York.
Trump said he "wouldn't like" to remove Rosenstein, but then delayed the meeting to avoid conflict with the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing in which both Kavanaugh and the woman who accused him of sexual misconduct, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, testified.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week-long FBI investigation into the claims against Kavanaugh, delaying a full Senate vote.
Trump's press secretary Sarah Sanders appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
Asked about the Rosenstein meeting, she said: "The date has not been set for it, it could be this week, I can see that the view could be pushed forward another week in view of all the other cases going on with the Supreme Court.
But we'll see and I always like to keep the press updated".
Some journalists have claimed that Sanders has not held a White House press conference since September 10.
Host Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders said that the lack of briefing was not due to TV reporters' aversion to "glamour", though he said: "I don't disagree with the fact that they're glamour".
He then suggested increasing direct contact between Trump and the press.
She said, "The president has more Q&amp;A sessions than any other president", without citing evidence, she said, "We've looked at those numbers".
The briefing will still be held, Sanders said, but "if the press has a chance to ask questions directly to the president of the United States, it's better than talking to me.
We try to do that a lot and you've seen us do that a lot in the last few weeks and when you can talk to the president of the United States, he's going to take the place of the press conference".
Trump regularly answers questions when leaving the White House or attending open sessions or press conferences with dignitaries.
Single press conferences are rare.
In New York this week, the president demonstrated to the attending press a bold and often unique presence, perhaps demonstrating why.
Health Secretary writes to EU workers in NHS Scotland about Brexit fears
The Health Secretary has written to the EU staff working in Scotland's NHS expressing the country's gratitude and wishing them well after Brexit.
Jean Fanry MSP sent a letter less than six months after the UK withdrew from the EU.
The Scottish Government is already committed to meeting the cost of settlement status applications for EU nationals working in its under-represented public services.
In her letter, Miss Freeman wrote: "Discussations between the UK and the EU continued over the summer, moving towards the expected decisions this autumn.
But the UK government is also stepping up its preparations for a possible no-deal scenario.
I know this must have been a very uncertain time for all of you.
That is why I would like to reiterate now how much I value the contribution of each staff member, regardless of their nationality.
The European Union, and colleagues beyond, bring together valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of health care, and benefit the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is absolutely your home and we would very much like you to stay".
Emergency surgery on Christian Abercrombie after a head injury
Tennessee Mike Organ reported that Tennessee State Tigers linebacker Christian Abercrombie, who suffered a 31-27 loss to the Vanderbilt Commodores on Saturday, underwent emergency surgery after sustaining a head injury.
Tennessee State head coach Rod Reed told reporters the injury occurred just before halftime.
"He came to the shore and just fell there", said Reed.
Instructors and medical staff placed him on a stretcher and oxygenated Abercrombie on the sideline before taking him back for further evaluation.
A Tennessee state official told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Aberdromby had just come out of surgery at the Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris said that "no details are available on the type/ extent of the injury at this time" and that Tennessee State is trying to determine when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a redshirt sophomore, is in his first season with Tennessee State after transferring from Illinois.
He totaled five tackles on Saturday before being pulled from the game, bringing his season total to 18 tackles.
High Stamp Duty will be charged to foreign buyers when buying property in UK
Foreign buyers will be charged higher stamp duty when they buy property in the UK, which will be used to help the homeless under new Tory schemes.
This move will neutralize the success of Corbyn's campaign to attract young voters.
Increased stamp duty will be levied on those who are not paying tax in the UK
The Treasury hopes it will raise up to £120 million a year - to help the homeless.
The government is preparing to charge a higher stamp duty rate on property purchases in the UK from foreign buyers - with the extra cash being used to help the homeless, Theresa May will announce today.
The move is being seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn's campaign to attract young voters with a promise to provide more affordable housing and target high earners.
The stamp duty increase will be levied on individuals and firms who do not pay tax in the UK, with the extra money boosting the government's campaign to deal with those who sleep in exotic conditions.
Surcharge - which is in addition to the current stamp duty, including the purchase of two houses and rental purchases commenced two years ago, may be a maximum of three per cent.
The Treasury expects to raise up to £120 million a year.
An estimated 13 per cent of newly built London properties are bought by non-UK residents, driving up prices and making it difficult for first-time buyers to get a foot in the door.
Many affluent areas of the country - especially in the capital - have become "ghost towns" because of the high number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.
The new policy comes just weeks after Boris Johnson called for a reduction in stamp duty, with the aim of helping more young people to build their first homes.
He accused large construction firms of inflating property prices by seizing land but not using it, and urged Ms. May to drop quotas on affordable housing to fix Britain's "housing shortage".
Mr. Corbin has announced a lucrative series of proposed housing reforms, including rent controls and an end to "no-fault" disputes.
They want to give more power to the councils to build new houses.
Mrs May said: "Last year I said I would dedicate my premiership to restoring the British dream - that life should be better for every new generation.
And that means fixing our fragmented housing market.
The UK will always be open to people who want to live, work and build a life here.
However, it is not true that it is as easy for non-UK resident individuals as well as overseas-based companies to buy a home as it is for hardworking British residents.
For many people, the dream of homeownership has become a distant dream, and the fury of gold in unfavorable circumstances is very real".
Jack Ross: 'My ultimate ambition is to manage Scotland'
Sunderland boss Jack Ross says his "ultimate ambition" is to become Scotland manager at some stage.
The 42-year-old Scott is reiterating the challenge of reviving the North-East club, which is currently in third place in League One, and which is three points off the top.
He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer after guiding St Mirren to the Scottish Premiership last year.
"I wanted to play for my country as a player.
I got a B cap and that was it", Ross told BBC Scotland's SportsSound.
"But I grew up with my father in Hampden, watching Scotland, and it's always been something that brings me back.
This opportunity will come only when I succeed in club management".
Ross' predecessors as manager of Sunderland have included Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Guus Poyet and Paolo Di Canio.
The former Alloa Athletic boss says he felt no nervousness in following such established names at such a big club, which had previously rejected the initiatives of Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"At this point, success for me is measured by whether I can get this club back to the Premier League?"
Due to the structure and facilities of this club, it undoubtedly belongs in the Premier League", he said.
"It's not an easy task to get there, but I might see myself as a success here if I can get the club there".
After spending 15 months on the coaching staff of Hearts and as assistant manager of Dumbarton, Ross's managerial career is just three years old.
He then helped Eloa recover from relegation to the third tier, and changed St Mirren from the brink of relegation to championship winners the following season.
And Ross says he feels more comfortable now than he did during his career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
In the case of Alois's taking over, he said, "It was probably a real crossroads".
"I really believed that management was a better fit for me than playing.
It seems odd because I did the right thing, made a decent living from it, and enjoyed some reasonable heights.
But playing can be difficult.
You have to get a lot of things on a weekly basis.
I still go through them in terms of job stress and pressure but in terms of management everything seems fine.
I've always wanted to manage and now that I'm doing it, it makes me the most comfortable in my entire adult life".

The best time for a pint is Saturday at 5. 30 pm, survey finds
The summer heat has given a boost to Britain's struggling pubs, but it has put more pressure on restaurant chains.
The pub and bar group saw sales rise 2.7 per cent in July - but restaurant fluctuations were down 4.8 per cent, the data showed.
Peter Martin, Business Consultancy CGA, which compiles the data, said: "Continuous sunshine and England's expected participation in the World Cup in July means that the month followed a similar pattern to last June, when pubs were up 2.8 per cent, except that the restaurant faced even more difficulties.
The decline of 1.8 per cent in restaurant business in June was worsened in July.
Pubs and bars selling alcohol performed strongest with more likes than restaurants.
Food - driven pubs also suffered losses in the sun, though not as dramatically as restaurant operators.
It seems that people just wanted to go out for a drink.
Drinks sales in all pubs and bars for the month increased by 6. 6 per cent, while food sales fell by three per cent.'
Paul Newman, RSM, leisure and hospitality analyst, said: "These results continue the trend we have seen since the end of April.
The influence of weather and major social or sporting events becomes the biggest factor for sales in the outdoor market.
It is no surprise that the restaurant groups continued to struggle, although a 4.8 per cent year-on-year decline in sales, especially due to ongoing cost pressures, would be painful.
The long summer season could not have been a worse time for food-stuff operators and only time will tell whether the higher moderate temperatures we have experienced in August will provide much needed relief".
The total sales growth in pubs and restaurants, including new openings in July, was 2.7 per cent, reflecting a slowdown in brand roll-out.
Coffer Peach Tracker monitors industry sales for the UK pub, bar and restaurant sector, collecting and analysing data from 47 performing operating groups with a combined turnover of £9 billion, and is an established industry benchmark.
One in five children has a secret social media account that they hide from their parents.
The survey shows that one in five children - including some as young as 11 - have secret social media accounts that they hide from their parents and teachers.
A survey of 20,000 secondary school students found an increase in "fake Insta" pages.
The news has raised fears that sexual content is being posted.
Twenty percent of students said they have a "main" account to show their parents
One in five children - some of them young people under the age of 11 - are creating social media accounts that they keep secret from adults.
A survey of 20,000 secondary school students found a rapid increase in "fake Insta" accounts - a reference to the photo-sharing site Instagram.
The news has raised fears that sexual content is being posted.
Twenty per cent of the students said they operate a clean "main" account to show their parents, while also having a private account.
A mother who suddenly looked at her 13-year-old daughter's secret site found that a teenager was urging others to "rape me".
Research of independent schools by Digital Awareness UK and The Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference (HMC) found that 40 per cent of children aged 11 to 18 had two profiles, half of whom were accepted to hold personal accounts.
Mike Buchanan, head of the HMC, said: "It is very troubling that so many teenagers are tempted to create online spaces where parents and teachers cannot find them".
Elidh Doyle will be the "voice for athletes" at the Scottish Athletics Board
Eilidh Doyle has been elected to the Scottish Athletics Board as a non-executive director at the Annual General Meeting of the Governing Body.
Doyle is Scotland's most decorated track and field athlete and Chairman Ian Beatty described the move as a great opportunity for those guiding the sport to benefit from their extensive experience at international level over the past decade.
Beatty said, "Elythe has a great deal of respect for the Scottish, UK and world athletics community and we are sure that athletics in Scotland will benefit greatly from having him on board".
Doyle said: "I look forward to serving as the voice of athletes and I hope I can really contribute and help guide the sport in Scotland".
In addition to his four Olympic gold medals, the American who won the 200m and 400m races at the 1996 Games in Atlanta and is now a regular BBC pundit, became unable to walk after a momentary ischemic attack.
He tweeted: "A month ago today I had a stroke.
I can't walk.
The doctors said that only time would tell whether I would recover and to what extent.
It was a daunting task, but to fully recover, walk again and learn to practice agility today!
Thank you for your encouraging messages!"
Comparison of mothers to cows by breast pump advertisement has created online controversy
A breast pump company divided opinion online by an ad that compared breastfeeding mothers to milking cows.
To mark the launch of a product called "the world's first silent wearable breast bump", consumer tech company Elvie released a new humorous music video-inspired ad, in which the new pump gives mothers the freedom to express themselves.
In the cow - grass barn, four real mothers dance to a song that includes such lyrics as: "Yes, I milk myself, but you don't see any tails" and "In case you haven't noticed, these aren't cows, these are my breasts".
The chorus goes on: "Pump it out, pump it out, I'm feeding them babies, pump it out, pump it out, I'm milking my ladies".
However, the ad, which has been published on the firm's Facebook page, has caused an online controversy.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video has received mixed reactions from viewers, with many saying it portrays the dairy industry's "horrors" in a light-hearted manner.
"Using cows for advertising this product is a very bad decision.
They need to be born to become pregnant and produce milk just like us, except that their babies are stolen from them within a few days of being born", wrote one.
Elvie Breast Pump fits neatly within the Elvie Nursing Bra
Another comment: "Obviously distressing for both mother and child.
But yes, why not use them to advertise breast pumps for mothers who have the opportunity to keep their babies?"
Another added: "What an irrelevant ad".
Others defended the ad, including one woman who said she found the song "funny".
"I think that's a very good idea.
I would have had this too, if I were still breast - feeding.
Pumping makes me feel like a cow.
This ad is a little strange, but I saw it for what it is.
One wrote that it was a great product".
Another commented: "It's a funny ad for mothers who pump (often at their workplace or in the toilet) and experience the "cow" feeling.
This is not a promotional or critical advertisement for the dairy industry".
At the end of the video, a group of women reported dancing while carefully pumping their bras.
The concept behind this campaign is based on the knowledge that many women who pump their breasts say they feel like a cow.
However, the LV pump is well hidden, has no wires or tubes and fits neatly straight into a nursing bra, giving women the freedom to move around, hold their babies and even go outside without pumping.
Ana Balerin, Partner and ECD at Mother commented: "LV Pump is a revolutionary product, which deserves a blast and a grand launch.
By drawing a parallel between women and dairy cows, we want to bring breast pumping and its challenges into the spotlight, showcasing in a fun and relevant way the sense of freedom that the new pump will bring.
This is not the first time that the Elvie Pump has been in the headlines.
During London Fashion Week, a mother of two who used the product was seen catwalking for designer Marta Jakubowski.
Hundreds of migrant children sneaked into a tent camp on the Texas border
Captured migrant children were spied on even when there was no change in monthly border crossings, in part because the harsh curbs and policies introduced by the Trump administration have made it difficult to recruit children with sponsors.
Traditionally, maximum sponsors hired undocumented migrants themselves and were afraid of jeopardizing their own ability to stay in the country by claiming any children in the future.
The threat escalated further in June, when federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adults or older members of the household would have to give their fingerprints and the data would then be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albans, a senior Immigration and Customs Enforcement official, presented evidence before Congress that the agency has arrested dozens of people who had applied to sponsor unaccompanied minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had no prior criminal record.
"About 80 per cent of individuals who are either sponsors or members of the sponsors household are in the country illegally and the highest number of them are criminals.
So we continue to look for those individuals", Mr. Elbens said.
Demanding the children be prepared quickly, the authorities introduced new rules requiring children to appear in court within one month of being arrested, rather than 60 days, which was the previous standard according to the asylum seeker.
Many people appear via video conference call rather than in person to present their case for legal status before an immigrant judge.
Those deemed unfit to be released are immediately dismissed.
The longer the children are held captive, the more likely they are to be unruly or depressed, which can be quantified in violent impulses or attempts to escape, according to reports by conservation workers and systems in recent months.
Lawyers said that cases are taken to a higher facility like Tornillo, where the signs that the child is struggling are ignored because of their size.
He also said that taking the children to the tent city without giving them enough time to prepare emotionally or without saying goodbye to friends would only add to the trauma they are already struggling with.
Syria calls for immediate withdrawal of US, French and Turkish occupation forces
Addressing the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Maulaim also called on Syrian refugees to return home, even as the country was now in the eighth year of war.
Ma'lam, who also serves as a deputy prime minister, said foreign military forces are staying illegally on Syrian soil under the pretext of fighting terrorism and "they will be treated accordingly".
"They must leave the battlefield immediately and unconditionally", he told the assembly.
Maulham insisted that the "war in Syria is almost over" where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and many millions have been uprooted from their homes.
Damascus will continue to fight this "supernatural war" until we both clear all Syrian territories of all terrorist groups and "any foreign presence", he said.
The United States has some 2,000 military forces in Syria, mainly training and advising both Kurdish and Syrian military forces in opposition to President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 military forces on the ground in the war-torn country.
On the refugees' case, Ma'lam said that the conditions were right for their return and he blamed "some Western countries" for "spreading fear of the unnecessary", which prompted the refugees to stay away.
"We have called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate this return", he said.
"They were politicizing a purely human issue".
The United States and the European Union warned that Syria will not receive any aid for reconstruction until a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war is reached.
A recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to set up a buffer zone in the last major rebel stronghold of Idlib, say U.S. politicians, creates an opportunity to press ahead with political negotiations.
The Russian-Turkish deal averted a large-scale attack by Russian-backed Syrian forces in the province, which was home to three million people.
However, Maullam said the agreement had "clear timelines" and also expressed hope that the military action would target jihadists, including fighters from the al-Qaeda-linked Nusra Front, who would be "eliminated".
The United States envoy Staffan Di Mistura hopes to hold the first meeting of a new committee with members of the government and opposition to prepare a post-war constitution to fix Syria and the path to elections soon.
Ma'alam laid down some conditions for the Syrian government's participation in the committee, saying that the panel's work should be restricted to "reviewing articles of the current constitution" and warning against interference.
Why Trump will win a second term
By that logic, Mr. Trump will win re-election in 2020, unless many liberals or elites are hoping for some sort of impeachment and scandal to prematurely end his term.
Without a doubt, "this will be the most dramatic finale of the National Post ever!"
So far, there was no fatigue in the audience.
Since 2014, prime-time ratings on CNN have more than doubled to 1.05 million and on MSNBC have nearly tripled to 1.6 million.
According to Nielsen, Fox News has averaged 2.4 million prime-time viewers over the past four years, up from 1.7 million, and MSNBC's "The Real Maddow Show" topped cable ratings with 3.5 million viewers with the top news broadcast of the night.
An ABC drama "Designated Survivor" about a cabinet secretary who becomes president after the U.S. Capitol building is destroyed in an attack, director Neil Baer said that "it's a fire that people are drawn to because it's not something we don't understand".
Neal Scovell, a veteran comedy writer and producer of "Just the Funny Parts: And the Hollywood Boys" has a different theory of some harsh truths hidden in the "Club".
She recalls a cab ride in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told him that he would vote for Mr. Trump.
Why? he asked.
"She said, 'Because they make me laugh,' " Ms. Scovell told me.
There was value in entertainment in the mess.
Of course, on TV and beyond, stories coming out of Washington could determine the future of Roe v. Wade, the reunification of immigrant families and the health of the global economy.
Only privileged viewers could risk not hearing it.
And yet, it's beyond being a savvy citizen, when you find yourself watching a six-hour panel of experts debate the original reason Woodward used for his book "Fear", the $15,000 bomber jacket of Paul Manafort ("a thick coat with a habbir", the Washington Post said) and the implications of Stormy Daniel's elaborate description of Mr. Trump's anatomy.
I'll never see Super Mario like that again.
Brent Montgomery, the producer of Wheelhouse Entertainment and "Pon Stars", said "as part of what he does, what makes it like a reality show where he brings you something new every night", is about Trump's show's rotating cast and Rose's plot twists (choosing a fight from N.F.L., praising Kim Jong-un).
You can't risk missing an episode or you'll be left behind.
When I went to see Mr. Fleas this week, it was a warm 80 degrees outside his home on the north side of Kauai, but he was inside recording CNN and watching MSNBC.
He could not shake himself off, as Brett Kavenno was ready to face the future of the Senate Judiciary Committee and the Supreme Court by hanging in the balance.
"I remember when we were doing all those silly or provocative shows in those days and people said 'This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization,' " Mr. Flash told me.
"I thought it was some kind of joke, but later I found out they were right".

The strong middle ground in the race for the Election House was flooded with outside money.
It was no surprise that Pennsylvania had been inundated with money or cash, the credit of which went to the reconstitution of the House of Representatives, which had brought two incumbents to the race for the same seat.
That recently opened the door for Rep. Connor Lamb, a Democrat from suburban Pittsburgh - who won his seat in the 2nd District in a special election last spring.
Lamp was also involved in the race for a second term, Republican Cath Rothfuss, who currently represents the old Pennsylvania's 12th district, which overlaps with the new 17th.
Following this decision by the Pennsylvania Supreme Court in January on the issue of unconstitutional forgery by the old districts in favor of the Republicans, the map or maps were redrawn.
The campaign economy was hit by a bare - handed battle between the major financial arms in the new 17th race, the Democratic Campaign Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a household name in Pennsylvania after a narrow victory in the widely watched March special election for Pennsylvania' s 18th congressional district.
That's why the seat has been held by Republicans for nearly a decade and why President Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
The political pundits incited the democrats a little more.
The U.S. punishes El Salvador for supporting China, then backs down
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing due to resistance by Washington.
Mr. Trump had a spirited meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017 and stayed at a hotel in Panama until the Trump Organization's management team fired the partners.
Earlier this month, department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said in a statement that "the recent decision to no longer recognize Taiwan" led State Department officials to recall U.S. heads of diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama.
But only El Salvador was penalized, which received an estimated $140 million in U.S. aid in 2017, including narcotics control, development and economic assistance.
The proposed penalties, which included cuts in financial aid and targeting visa restrictions, would be painful for the Central American country and its high unemployment and murder rates.
When internal meetings progressed, North American and Central American officials postponed the high-level conference focusing on security and economic prosperity to follow the same rally or gathering as last year, which was seen as a step forward in an effort to prevent migrants from leaving the United Nations.
But by mid-September, top administration officials made it clear that they wanted the conference to go ahead and end effectively, while considering any penalties or fines for El Salvador.
The diplomats said Vice President Mike Pence is now ready to address the conference in a nod to importing administrative spaces at the conference, which is now scheduled for mid-October.
And three Americans returned quietly from Washington to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without any harsh messages or punishments.
A White House spokesman for Mr. Bolton declined to comment on the details of the debate or argument described by three U.S. officials, including two politicians, who agree to discuss internal deliberations on the condition of anonymity.
His accounts have been confirmed by an outside analyst who is close to the administration and also spoke on condition of anonymity.
history of study
The next case could be the Special Counsel Robert Mueller's report on the possible obstruction of justice in Mr. Trump's case, of which there is now ample evidence in the public record.
Mr. Mueller also reportedly reversed his investigation into whether Mr. Trump's campaign colluded with Russia to invade our elections.
When Congress joins hands, Mr. Trump finds himself accountable in that body as he prepares to go before voters again and perhaps before a jury of his colleagues.
That is, a lot of ifs and ifs, and I don't mean to suggest that the collapse of Mr. Trump or his counterparts in Europe is inevitable.
We all have choices to make on both sides of the Atlantic, which will affect how long the conflict can last.
In 1938, the German authorities were ready to make a move against Hitler, only if he was opposed from the West and supported by the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We failed, and as a result, we missed the opportunity to prevent so many years of genocide.
The unstoppable march of historical centers and democracy around such points of divergence is accelerated or delayed.
Americans now face many of these divergence points.
If Mr. Trump fires Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosentine, the person who controls the final outcome of Mr. Mueller's investigation, what will we do?
Rosenthal has been in this dilemma ever since this paper reported it last year, suggesting that the president keep secret records and consider him unfit for office.
Mr. Rosentine said that The Times account is not accurate.
"How do we respond if the recently requested F.B.I. investigation of Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair - or if he persists in the Supreme Court despite the evidentiary charges of sexual abuse and perjury?
And beyond that, will we vote for Congress in the midterms, for which Mr. Trump will be accountable?
If we fail in those investigations, democracy will endure a long winter.
But I think because of the lessons I learned in Prague, we will not fail.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who had been exiled to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that had once occupied my embassy.
She survived and moved to the United States, and 60 years later, she sent me to light candles on a swastika table on Shabbat.
With that as my legacy, how can I not be optimistic about my future?"
Norman Aysen, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, is chairman of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington and the author of "The Last Palace: Europe's Turbulent Century in Five Lives and a Legendary House".
Graham Doran's Rangers are optimistic even after a fierce Vienna clash.
Rangers hosted Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that after a spectacular draw in Spain against Villarreal earlier this month, a victory over the Austrians would put them in a strong position to qualify for Group G of the Europa League.
A knee injury prevents midfielder Graham Durden from appearing for the first time in the season until the 2-2 draw with Villarreal, but he believes the Rangers can use that result as a springboard for bigger things.
"It was a good thing for us because Villarreal were good", said the 31-year-old.
"We went into the game with the belief that we could achieve something and reach a conclusion.
Maybe we can get it in the end, but overall, the draw will probably be a fair result.
They were probably better in the first period and we came out even better in the second period.
Moving on to Thursday, it's another big European night.
Hopefully we can get three points but it will be a tough game because they had good results in their last game with the crowd behind us, I am sure we will play well and can get a positive result.
With all the things that happened with my injuries and the changes that I made in the club, last year was definitely difficult but now it is a good experience in this place.
The squad is good and the boys are really enjoying it; they have got good training.
Hopefully we can now move on from our last session and be successful".
Women are losing their sleep over this retirement savings.
Despite the fact that survey participants were clearly aware of the type of care they needed, some were talking to their family members about it.
More than half of the people across the country said they were talking to their partner about long-term care costs.
Only 10 percent said they talked to their children about it.
"People want a family member to take care of them or look after them, but they don't take any steps to negotiate", said Holly Sinder, vice president of life insurance business across the country.
Here's where to start.
Talk to your spouse and children: You will not be able to prepare to care for your family if you do not tell them your wishes ahead of time.
Discuss with your counsellor and your family where and how to get care, as they can be important factors in determining the cost of the option.
Ask your financial adviser: Your adviser may also suggest ways to pay for those expenses.
Your funding options for long-term care can include a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a hybrid cash-value life insurance policy, to help pay for these expenses or to insure your own health, as long as you have the money.
Present your legal documents: make your legal battle easier.
Get a health-care proxy so you can appoint a trusted person to oversee your medical care and ensure that professionals follow your wishes if you are unable to communicate or interact.
Also, consider a power of attorney to supervise your finances.
You would choose someone you trust to make financial decisions for you and ensure that your bills are paid if you are incapacitated.
Don't forget the small details: Imagine that your elderly parent has a medical emergency and is taken to the hospital.
So will you be able to answer their questions related to medications and allergies?
Put that information in a written plan so you're prepared.
"It's not just the financials, but who's the doctor?" asked Martin.
"What medications are given?
Who will take care of the dog?
Is there a plan?"
A man fired several shots into the air in Lafrakomb
A man was shot several times with an air rifle as he was walking home at night.
The 40-year-old victim was in the Oxford Grove area of Laffracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, abdomen and hand.
Officials describe the shooting of the BST at around 02:30 as an "accidental incident".
The victim could not see his attacker.
His wounds were not so deep, so the police appealed to him to be a witness.
The earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed by a powerful earthquake and tsunami in the Indonesian city on Friday, officials said, with the death toll expected to rise.
With communications down, rescue officials were unable to get any information from the Dongola Regency, the northern area of Palu, which is near the epicenter of the 7.5-magnitude earthquake.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people trapped in the disaster were evacuated.
Here are some key facts about Palu and Dongola, located on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the Central Sulawesi province, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017, located on the shore of a narrow bay on the western coast of Sulawesi Island.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami struck.
Dongala is a regency on the coast in the north west of Sulawesi Island, spread over an area of more than 300 kilometres (180 mi).
The regency below the administrative province has an estimated population of 299, up from 200 in 2017.
The economy of Central Sulawesi province was based on fishing and farming, especially in the coastal areas of Dongola.
Nickel mining is also very important in the province, but it is concentrated in Morowali on the opposite shores of the Sulawesi Maximum.
According to Indonesia's Disaster Mitigation Agency, tsunamis have knocked on doors in Palu and Dongola several times in the last 100 years.
In 1938, a tsunami in Dongola killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes.
In 1996, a tsunami also struck western Dongola, killing nine people.
Indonesia sits on the seismically active Pacific Ring of Fire and is regularly hit by earthquakes.
Here are some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis that have occurred in recent years:
2004: A major earthquake on December 26 caused a tsunami in 14 countries on the western coast of Indonesia's Aceh province in North Sumatra, killing 226,000 people on the Indian Ocean coastline, half of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of strong earthquakes also hit the western coasts of Sumatra in March and early April.
Hundreds were killed on the island of Nias off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A tsunami of magnitude 6.8 hit the most populous island of Indonesia, Java, activating a tsunami that blasted off the southern coast and killed about 700 people.
2009: An earthquake of magnitude 7.6 near the city of Padang affected the area which is the capital of West Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: An earthquake of magnitude 7.5 on the island of Mentawai off the coast of Sumatra affected the area, causing a tsunami of up to 10 meters, which destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A splash water earthquake in Ake attacked the Pidi Jaya Regency, causing destruction and devastation as it reminded people of the destruction or devastation of the 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
This time there was no tsunami, but more than 100 people were killed by the collapse of buildings.
2018: Severe earthquakes devastated the Indonesian tourist island of Lombok, killing more than 500 people, mostly on the island's north side.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of tourists helpless for a while.
Sarah Palin's oldest son arrested for domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of East Alaska governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, was arrested for assault.
Palin, 29, of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, tampering with reports of domestic violence and resisting arrest, according to a report released Saturday by the state of Alaska.
According to the police report, when a female acquaintance tried to call the police to report an alleged crime, he would take the phone from her.
Palin was sent back to the Maut-Su pretrial facility and also fined $500 in unsecured bonds, according to KTUU reports.
The network reports that he appeared in court on Saturday, where he declared himself "not guilty" when asked for a plea.
Palin faced three Class A felonies, where he could have been sentenced to up to a year in prison and a $250,000 fine.
He is also charged with a Class B felony, punishable by one day in jail and a $2,000 fine.
This is not the first time that Palin has been the subject of criminal cases.
In December 2017, he was convicted of assaulting his father Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged assault.
The case is currently before the Alaska Veterans' Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, obstruction of report of domestic violence and possession of a weapon while intoxicated in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend accused him of punching her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by a group of veterans in 2016 after linking her son's violent behavior to PTSD stemming in Iraq.
The earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia: Hundreds killed
At least 384 people were killed after an earthquake shook the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The 7.5 magnitude earthquake triggered a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
In the days to come, with the death rate rising, electricity and communication networks were not working.
The earthquake struck in Central Sulawesi, the northeastern region of the Indonesian capital, Jakarta.
Videos showing the impact were circulating on social media.
When the tsunami hit the coast, thousands of people gathered in the city of Palu for the beach festival.
Federal prosecutors are seeking a rare death sentence for the suspect in the NYC attack.
Federal prosecutors in New York are seeking a rare death sentence for Safuło Saipov, the suspect in the New York City terror attack that killed eight people -- a rare sentence in the state for a federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, 30, allegedly used a Home Depot rented truck to raid bikes on a westbound highway path in lower Manhattan while cutting pedestrians and cyclists in October.
According to the notice of intent to seek the death penalty filed in the Southern District of New York, to justify the death penalty, prosecutors must prove that Saipov "intentionally" killed eight victims and "intentionally" injured them physically".
Both these countries have a potential death sentence according to court documents.
A week after the attack, a federal grand jury slapped Saipov with a 22 count, including eight counts of murder for aiding in racketeering, which are used by federal prosecutors in cases of organized crime in particular and in cases of violence and motor vehicle destruction.
Prosecutors said the attack required "adequate planning and prior deliberation", explaining the manner in which Sypov carried it out in a "detestable, cruel and vicious" manner.
"Saffulo Habibulavich Saipov wounded and caused damage to the friends and families of Diego Enrique Angellini, Nicholas Kleeves Enlor Decat, Darren Drake, Ariel Alirge, Hernan Ferrucci, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Pagunco", is expressed in the note of intent.
Five of the victims were tourists, who were from Argentina.
The previous death penalty case in the Southern District of New York has been going on for a decade.
Mulzim Khalid Brain was found guilty of the murders of two drug suppliers but was eventually sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last death sentence was handed down in 1953 in the New York federal case of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple who were convicted two years earlier of conspiring to spy for the Soviet Union during the Cold War.
John Rosenberg was sentenced to death by the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, a local resident of Uzbekistan, had no regrets or remorse for days and months after the attack, according to court documents.
Police said he told investigators that he liked what he did.
Saipov told authorities that he was inspired to carry out the attack after seeing ISIS videos on his phone, which he said were linked to the crime.
He also requested to be shown the ISIS flag in his hospital room, police said.
He pleaded not guilty to the offence of 22 counts.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, says he is "blatantly disappointed" with the prosecutor's decision.
"We feel that our decision to seek the death penalty rather than accept a life sentence without any possibility of parole will only postpone the psychological trauma of these events to include everyone", Patton said.
Saipov's defense team had earlier asked prosecutors not to seek the death penalty.
Tory MP says Nigel Farage should be made the Brexit negotiator
Nigel Farage vowed to 'make an army of people' during the protest at the Tory conference.
The Eastern UKIP leader called on politicians to 'get the mood' with the Eurosceptics - as one of Theresa May's own MPs suggested they should negotiate with the EU.
Conservative backbencher Peter Bone told the March in Birmingham that if Mr Farage had been Brexit secretary, he would have "put the UK out" by now.
But the challenges Mrs May faces in addressing her deeply divided ranks have been underlined by pro-Remain Tory's efforts to add a different anti-Brexit stance in the city.
Premier Brexit is struggling to keep his checkered deal plan on track amid attacks from the Remnants and the EU.
The allies urged that she try to make a deal with Brussels instead of a backlash - and force the Eurosceptics and workers to choose between their package and anarchy.
Mr. Bohn said that leaving means leaving the rally in Solihull, in which he wants to 'throw the chequers'.
He suggested that Mr. Faraz should be made a partner and given the responsibility of negotiating with Brussels.
'If he was in charge, we would have been out by now,' he said.
Wellingborough MP said: 'I will stand for Brexit but we need to get the Chequers out.'
Setting the opposition in the European Union, he said: 'We don 't need to be subject to anyone to fight a world war.'
We want to make our own laws in our country.
Mr. Bown rejected all suggestions that changed public opinion after the 2016 vote: 'The idea that the British people have changed their mind and they want to stay is completely false.'
Tory Brexiteer Andrea Jenkins was also in the march, saying: 'I'm just saying: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
'The Checker is not popular among the general public, the opposition will not vote for it because it is not so popular among our party and our workers who actually march in the streets and elect us in the first place.
Please stop checking and start listening.'
In a focused message to Mrs. M, he said: "Prime Ministers keep their jobs when they don't break their promises".
Shri Faraz said the leaders of the rally should be made to 'feel the atmosphere' if they are cheating with the decision taken in the 2016 referendum.
'This is now a matter between us - the people and our political classes,' he said.
'They are trying to cheat Brexit and we are here today to tell them, 'We will not let you get away with it.'
Addressing the enthusiastic crowd, he said: 'I want you to build our political class, which understands the climate on the verge of betraying Brexit.
'We are mobilising the army of the people of this country that has given us victory over Brexit and that will not rest until we are an independent, self-governing and proud United Kingdom.'
Meanwhile, the Remnants march through Birmingham before a two-hour rally through the city centre.
A group of activists pointed the Tories against the Brexit banner after the group's launch this weekend.
Labor peer Lord Adonis pretends to talk about security problems with the Party app at the opening of the conference.
'These are the people who tell us that they can have the right IT systems and all the technology for Canada, for the borderless border and for borderless free trade in Ireland.
'It's a full swing.
There is no such thing as a good Brexit, he said.
Warren plans to take a 'tough look' at the president's operations
U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren says she will "keep a close eye on the president's operations" after the November elections.
The Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts Democrat or Democrat spoke about his future during a town hall in western Massachusetts on Saturday.
A regular critic of President Donald Trump, Warren is in the re-election race in November with GOP state icon Geof DeHaul, who was co-chair of Trump's 2016 Massachusetts campaign.
She was widely speculated to be the next in line to replace Trump in 2020.
The event Saturday afternoon in Holyoke was Trump's 36th meeting with constituents using the town hall format since taking office.
One of the attendees asked if she was going to join the presidential race.
Warren responded that it was time for "women to go and fix our broken government and include women first".
LSU Sim was arrested in death
In Baton Rouge, LA, on Saturday, police announced that a suspect was arrested in the killing of LSU basketball player Wade Sim on Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of 20-year-old Dayton Simpson at 11 a.m. ET. The news conference was held at the.
They released a video of the shooting on Friday, asking for help identifying a man seen in the footage.
Sim, 20, was shot and killed near the campus of Southern University on Friday morning.
"Wade Sim died of a gunshot wound to the head", police chief Murphy G. Paul told 247 Sport on Saturday.
Wade went forward to defend his friend and was killed by Simpson.
Simpson, when questioned, admitted to killing Wade Sim with a gun.
Simpson was arrested without incident and taken into custody by the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
A 6 by 6 foot junior, who grew up in Bayonne Rogue, played in 32 games with 10 starts last season at SIM and averaged 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton ends world title after team victory over Sebastian Vettel
From that moment it became clear that Valtteri Bottas was fit to play a big part in Saturday's Louis Hamilton Mercedes team order race.
From the pole, Bottas made a good start and put Hamilton out as he made his way through the first two corners and invited Vitelli to create a hurdle in his team's drivers.
Vettel went into the pits first and left Hamilton in the back of the pack in traffic, something that should be decisive.
Mercedes was a lap behind and came out the back of the wagon but Hamilton got ahead after some wheel-to-wheel action which saw the Ferrari driver reluctantly leave the third corner defending after a double-move without any risk.
Max Verstappen started from the back row of the grid and was seventh when he reached the end of the first lap by his 21st birthday.
He then moved on to a large part of the race when he focused on changing his tyres and quickly overtook Kimi Räikkönen in fourth place.
He finally got into the pits on lap 44, but was unable to pick up his pace in the remaining eight laps, when Reckonen finished fourth.
It was a difficult day when Valtteri did a great job all weekend and is a really nice gentleman.
The team performed brilliantly by getting one-two, Hamilton said.
It was really bad gestures.
President Donald Trump on Saturday, acting on his request, falsely accused Senator Dianne Feinstein of not leaking a letter from Christine Blasey Ford in which she accused Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual abuse.
While speaking at a rally in West Virginia, the president did not directly address the statement made by Ford before the Senate Judiciary Committee, instead commenting on the current state of the Senate, saying that people are "mean and mean and dishonest".
"One of the very good things or things that can happen in the Senate in the last few days is when you see anger, when you see angry, mean and bad and dishonest people", he said.
"When you see the release and the leak and then they say, 'Hey, I didn't do it.'
I did not do it".
Remember that?
Dean Feinstein, did you leak?
His response, remember -- did you leak the document -- was, "Oh, oh, what?
Oh, not at all.
I did not leak".
Well, wait a minute.
Did we leak... No, we didn 't leak, he said, pointing to the senator.
A letter detailing Ford's allegations against Kavanaugh was sent to Feinstein back in July and leaked in early September - but Feinstein denied that it had been leaked from the office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's allegations, I didn't leak his story", Feinstein told the committee, Hill reported.
"He asked me to keep it secret and I kept it secret as he said".
But the president did not find his refusal justified, who remarked at the Saturday night rally: "I tell you, these were really bad gestures.
He may not have done it, but I have rarely seen such bad manners before".
Continuing his defense of the Supreme Court nominee accused of sexual misconduct by three women, the President pointed out that the Democrats were using the allegations on their behalf.
"They are determined to take back power by any means necessary.
You see their stupidity, filth and also that they don 't care who they hurt or who they are running after for power or power or control", the mediator reported the president 's words.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giant, which is the first time the team has won the Premier League.
Patrick Dever scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee
Dundee Stars made up for Friday's Elite League loss against Belfast Giants by winning a 5-3 return match at Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants got an early two - goal lead through strikes from Patrick Doyer and Francis Beaulieulier.
Giant's lead was held by Mike Sullivan and Jordan Crowney before Dier re-established the home side level.
Francois Bouchard equalised for the Dundee before a two - goal win was secured by Lucas Lundwalt Nielsen.
It was the third elite defeat of the season for Adam Keefe's men, who came from behind to beat Dundee 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night.
With the Giants winning the last three games, this was the fourth meeting of the season on the sides.
Dwyer's opener came in the fourth minute at 3:35 with a help from Kendall McFall, with David Rutherford helping Beaulieuer to double the lead in the next four minutes.
In a busy early period, Sullivan made his home run back at 13:10 before Matt Merquadret equalised Cooney at 15:16.
Dwyer ensures that the Giants take the lead in the first period until he scores his second goal of the night at the end of the first period.
The home side regroup and Bouchard once again brings them to a level period with a power play goal at 27:37.
Cooney and Charles Corcoran combined to help Nielsen give Dundee the lead for the first time in the second period of the match and he secured his team 's victory in the fifth halfway in the final period.
The Giants, who had lost their last five matches so far, are now set to play their next match at their home ground, Milton Keene, on Friday.
An air traffic controller was killed while ensuring that hundreds of people could escape the quake
An air traffic controller in Indonesia is hailed as a hero, since he died ensuring that a plane carrying hundreds of people could be landed safely.
More than 800 people were killed and many more are missing after a major earthquake struck the island of Sulawesi on Friday, activating a tsunami.
Aftershocks continued to wreak havoc in the area and many people were trapped under the rubble in the city of Palu.
But while his colleagues were running for their lives, 21-year-old Anthony Gunawan Egang refused to leave his post at the busyly controlled Muttiara Sis Al Jufri Airport at Palu Airport.
He was there to make sure that Beatic Air Flight 6321, which was on the runway at the time, could land safely.
Then he jumped off the traffic control tower when he thought it was going to fall.
He later died in the hospital.
A spokesman for Air Navigation Indonesia, Johannes Sirtret, said the decision could have saved hundreds of lives, ABC News of Australia reported.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take him to a larger hospital from another city.
Unfortunately, we lost them before the helicopter could reach the back of the plane.
"It broke our hearts to see him go", she said.
Meanwhile, officials fear that the death toll could reach thousands as the country is devastated, with the Alpine Agency saying access to the Dongola, the Sigui and the Botonsh is limited.
"The death rate may still be higher as many bodies may still be buried in remains or debris, or in many places that cannot be accessed", said Suthopo Nugroho, a spokesman for the agency.
Waves up to six metres high devastated Palu, leading to a mass burial on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft are bringing in aid and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Every minute the ambulances were bringing in the bodies.
Fresh water is rare.
Small markets were robbed everywhere".
The head of the International Red Cross, Jane Galfand, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is running the race to help the survivors, but we don't know what they will find there.
It's already a tragedy, but it could be worse".
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palau on Sunday and told the country's military: "I am asking you all to work day and night to complete every task related to evacuation or evacuation.
Are you ready?" reported CNN.
In Indonesia earlier this year, an earthquake struck in Lobong, killing about 550 people.
Micronesia plane crash: Air Navigation now says one man is missing since the lagoon plane crash
The airline operating the plane that crashed in the Pacific Lagoon in Macronesia now says one man is missing, when last reported 47 passengers and crew or crew were safely evacuated from the sinking plane.
Air Navigation said in a release on Saturday afternoon that it could not locate a male passenger.
The airline said it was working closely with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to locate the man.
The airline does not respond immediately to requests for information about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
When the plane went into the water while attempting to land at the Tuck Island Airport, local boats helped rescue other passengers and crew.
Seven people were taken to hospital, officials said on Friday.
The airline said that six passengers were in hospital on Saturday and all of them are now stable.
The cause of the crash and the manner in which it occurred are unclear.
The airline and the US Navy say that the two planes did not land properly on the runway.
Some witnesses or eyewitnesses thought that the planes did not land on the runway.
American passenger Bill Jen said the plane had come down too low.
Jane said, "That's a very good thing".
Jane said that she and others were pulled out of the deep water by an emergency exit from the sinking plane.
He said the flight crew were panicked and screaming and he suffered a minor head injury.
The US Navy said that sailors working nearby to improve the pier also helped rescue people using a windboat to bring them ashore in about 30 meters (100 feet) of water before the plane sank.
Data from the Aviation Safety Network indicates that 111 people were killed in PNG-registered airline crashes in the last two decades but none were involved in air navigation.
The analyst said the time of night when the woman was burned alive
Prosecutors restored their case on Saturday to retry a man accused of burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.
The US Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett presented hours of evidence as an expert witness in the field of forensic analysis.
He told the jury how he used cellphone records to reconcile the activities of 29-year-old criminal Quinton Telles and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers on the night of his death.
Rolette said she obtained location data from several cellphones, which shows that she was with Tallis Chambers on the evening of her death, contradicting her previous claims, The Clarion-Ledger reported.
When the data shows that when he said he was with his friend Michelle Sanford, his cell phone was with Chambers at the time, the police told Sanford.
Sanford came forward on Saturday and presented evidence that he was not in town that day.
When prosecutors asked whether Talley was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said he was "lying because his truck was in Nashville".
The second discrepancy was that Tallis said he knew Chambers from about two weeks before his death.
Cell phone records show they've known each other for a week.
Rowlett said that shortly after Chambers' death, Tallis deleted all of Chambers' texts or messages, calls or contact information from his phone.
"He erased her from his life", said Hale.
The defence is ready to begin their closing arguments on Sunday.
The judge said he expected to go to the jury for hearing the case that day.
High Breed: What is conscious or conscious hip hop?
The hip hop trio wants to change the negative view of the genre by infusing positive messages in their music.
High Breed from Bristol claimed that hip-hop has strayed from its roots to deal with political messages and social issues.
They wanted to get away from their roots and bring back popular hip-hop.
Artists such as Fugees and Common saw a recent resurgence in the UK through artists such as Alaca and Loki.
Another black guy?!
NY nanny prosecutes couple after firing them after "racist" text
A New York nanny sues a couple for biased targeting after a mother complains that she is "the other black person" for misleading text.
The couple deny they are racist, suing for "attraction".
Lynsey Plasko-Flaxman, a mother of two, expresses her unease when she discovers that new babysitter Giselle Morris, who was black on her first day of work in 2016, is pregnant.
"No other black person", Mrs. Plasco Flaxman said in a text to her husband.
However, instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it twice to Miss Morris.
According to a New York Post, after realizing his mistake, a "dumb" Plac-Flexman fired Ms. Morris, explaining that his outgoing nanny, who was African-American, had done a bad job and he was hoping for a Filipino instead.
Ms. Morris was sent home to Uber for her one day's work.
Now, Morris is demanding the couple's dismissal and $350 a day compensation for six months, at the live-in gig she was hired to start without a contract.
"Look I want to show them that you don't do any such work", he said in a post on Friday, adding that "I know it's discrimination".
The couple said on claims that they were racist, stating that after insulting her they could not trust her, it was appropriate to terminate Morris' employment.
"My wife sent something that she didn't mean.
He is not a racist.
We are not racist people", husband Joe Plasto told the Post.
But would you trust your children to someone you've offended, even if it was by mistake?
your newborn baby?
Let it go".
Like the "disappearance" lawsuit, Plasco said his wife has only had a baby for two months and is in a "very difficult situation".
"You're going after someone like that?
It is not right to do this", the investment banker said.
While the legal case is still ongoing, the couple has reacted swiftly to the accusations on social media, silencing them for their behavior and reasoning.
Paddiston publishers fear that readers will not associate it with their own ideas and opinions, the new paper reveals.
Bond's daughter Karen Jenkell, who was born after the book was approved, said in the letter: "It is difficult to put yourself in someone's place when you read it for the first time before it was published.
It's amazing to know about the success of Paddington".
Talking about his father, who worked as a BBC cameraman before writing a children's book inspired by a little bear toy, he was optimistic about his work being rejected, he said that there was both "joy and sadness" in the 60th anniversary of the publication of his book after his death.
Of Paddington, whom she describes as "an important member of her family", she says her father was proud of her potential success.
"He was a quiet man and not at all proud", she said.
"But because Paddington was so real to him, it was almost like you have a child who gets what he gets: you're proud of them, even though you're not actually doing it.
I think that's how they saw Paddington's success.
Although it was his own invention and creation, he always credited Paddington for it".
My daughter was dying, and I had to say goodbye to her on the phone.
Upon landing, his daughter was taken to the Louis Pasteur 2 hospital in Nice, where the work done by the doctors was useless.
"Nade was regularly saying that it was really bad, it was not expected", said Mrs. Adenne-Laprouse.
"Then Nad called me to tell me that she was going to die in the next two minutes and that I had to say goodbye to her.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, son.
I 'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The medication the doctors had given her to keep her heart beating was slowly being released from her system.
She had died some time ago and it would have all stopped.
I just had to sit there and wait, even though I knew it was all about to end.
I couldn't scream, yell, or cry, because I was surrounded by my family.
I had to take care of everything".
Finally Mrs. Adnan-Laprousse, who was grieving the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane with the other passengers - who were unaware of the situation they were going through.
"No one knows", he said.
"I kept my head down and tears were flowing all the time.
It was hard to express, but I got to see the feeling of extreme sympathy for Nad on the plane.
He needed my love and understanding.
I know how much he loved her".
Postcards of the victims to prevent suicide on the bridge
Two women who lost loved ones to suicide want to prevent others from losing their lives.
Sharron Davis and Kylie Humphrey post cards and phone numbers on the Welsh bridge with inspirational messages on which people can call for help.
Mr. Davis' son was 13 years old when he suffered from depression and committed suicide at the age of 18.
"I don't want any parent to feel what I feel every day", she said.
Mr Davis, 45, who lives in Lidney, said his son was a promising chef who spread his smile everywhere.
"Everyone knew him for his smile.
He always said that her smile could light up anywhere".
Although he had left work before he died and he lived in a "very dark room".
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 at the time, committed suicide after searching for his missing sibling.
"I was constantly worried that there was going to be some cumulative effect", Ms. Davis said.
Ms. Davis created the cards "to let people know that there are people out there you can go and talk to, even if it's not a friend".
Don't sit still - you need to talk".
Ms. Humphreys, who has been a friend of Ms. Davis for years, lost her friend Mark of 15 years, shortly after her mother's death.
"He didn't say anything about feeling sad or miserable or anything", she said.
"A few days before Christmas we will give him some changes in his behavior.
He was very sad on Christmas Day - when the children opened their presents, he couldn't see them".
She said that his death was a great shock to her, but she had to get out of it: "It tore the family apart from the inside.
It made us sad.
But we all had to go forward and fight".

Kavanaugh's future was in doubt when the FBI began its investigation.
"I thought, if I could actually get something that he is looking for - a limited time and limited scope investigation - maybe we could bring some unity", Mr. Flake said Saturday, adding that he fears the committee is "breaking up" amid allegedly partisan gridlock.
Why did Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want an FBI investigation?
The timing was the reason for his reluctance.
The midterm elections were only five weeks away, on November 6 - as expected, the Republicans perform very poorly, so they would be severely weakened in their efforts to win the high court on the ground.
George W. Bush picks up the phone to call the senator, campaigns to support Mr. Kuangua, who worked for Mr. Bush in the White House and through him meets his wife, Ashley, who was Mr. Bush's personal secretary or secretary.
What happened after the FBI submitted its report?
The vote will take place in the Senate, which currently has 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is not clear that Mr. Kuangua could get at least 50 votes on the Senate floor, which Vice President Mike Pence had to do by eliminating it and confirming it in the Supreme Court.
North Korean defectors 'taken down' by Kim
The number of North Korean defectors to South Korea declined when John - un took power seven years ago, a South Korean administrator said.
Citing the South's Ministry of Integration, Park Byung-seog said 1,127 people fled their duties last year, compared to 2,706 in 2011.
The strong border between North Korea and China and the high rates imposed by smugglers and tax evaders were the main factors, Mr Park said.
Pyongyang made no public comment.
A large number of fugitives from the North are eventually offered South Korean citizenship.
Seoul says more than 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
The maximum fleeing is China, whose border with North Korea is the longest and the most easily crossed between the two Koreas is the heavily guarded Demilitarized Zone (DMZ).
China treats fugitives as illegal immigrants rather than refugees and often forcibly returns them to their country.
Relations between the North and South - which are still technically at war - have seen improvement in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of both countries meet in Pyongyang for talks that focus on stalled denuclearization talks.
It was activated after the historic meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore in June, when they broadly agreed on the terms of working towards a nuclear-free Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed the US sanctions for the lack of progress since then.
"Without any faith in America, there will be no faith in our national security and in such circumstances, we will have no choice but to unilaterally harm ourselves first", Mr. Roy said in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi called Brett Kavanaugh "funny", said he was not fit for the Supreme Court.
House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi called Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh "a joke" and said he was inherently unfit to serve on the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made the comments in an interview Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I can't think of a woman who would even perform like this, they call it "fun", Pelosi said Thursday in response to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee.
Kavanaugh emotionally denied the allegations that he ever sexually abused Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
In his early statements, Kavanaugh was very emotional, sometimes screaming and holding his breath while talking about his family and his school years.
He blasted the Democrats on the committee for clearly disproving allegations of "strange and coordinated character assassination" by liberals who were angry about Hillary Clinton's 2016 presidential loss.
Pelosi said she felt Kavanaugh 's testimony proved he could not serve on the Supreme Court, as it showed he was biased against Democrats.
"I think he disqualified himself with those statements and also the way he went to the Clintons and the Democrats", she said.
Pelosi expressed suspicion that if Kavanaugh becomes permanent and if the Democrats win a majority in the House of Representatives, she would still blame Kavanaugh when asked.
"I will say this -- if he doesn't tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, he's not fit for the Supreme Court, but because he's been invited he can work right now", Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge on the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals.
Pelosi said that as a Democrat she was concerned about the possible rules for Kavanaugh against the Affordable Care Act or Roe v. Wade, as he is known to make conservative judgments.
In his certification hearing, Kavanaugh dodged questions about whether he would overturn some Supreme Court decisions.
"At his confirmation hearing, Kavanagh waived questions on whether he would overturn some of the Supreme Court's decisions.
And women need to shake it up.
It is a religious offense, months and years of anger come out and she cannot stop herself from crying.
Ms. Stamin told me 45 years later, "When we cry, we get angry".
"I don't think that's unusual, do you?"
She went on to say, "I had a great help from a woman who works for an official somewhere, who said that she also cries when she gets angry, but she has developed a new technique, which means that when she gets angry and she starts crying, she will say to the person she was talking to, "You might think that I'm sad because I'm crying.
I'm mad at you".
And then she kept on talking.
And I thought it was great".
Tears are allowed to come out as part of anger because they are fundamentally misunderstood.
One of my fondest memories of a first job, a male head office, is when I found myself crying in an unspeakable rage, finding an old woman holding my neck from behind - a sharp manager I'd always been a little afraid of - who had dragged me down the stairs.
He said, "Never cry in front of anyone".
"They don't know how angry you are.
They think you are sad and you will be happy to meet them. "
Patricia Schroeder, a Democratic congressional female speaker from Colorado, has worked with Gary Hart on the presidential run.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught having an affair outside of marriage in a boat called the Monkey Business and was withdrawn from the race, Mrs. Schroeder, deeply disappointed, decided to run for president herself.
"It was not a deliberate decision", he said to me after 30 years, laughing.
"There were already seven other candidates in the race and the last thing they needed was another candidate.
Someone called her "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs".
Since the campaign was delayed, she did not have time to raise funds and so she vowed that she would not participate in the race until she had raised 2 million dollars.
It was a losing battle.
He found that some of his supporters who had given the men $1,000 would only give him $250.
"Do they think I have a discount?" he wondered.
When she made her speech announcing that she would not launch a formal campaign, she could not contain the emotions - gratitude for the people who supported her, frustration with the system that made it difficult for her to raise funds, and frustration with the voters she targeted instead of the representatives and anger at sexism - that began to suffocate her.
"You must have thought I was going to have a nervous breakdown", Ms. Schroeder recalled how the press would have reacted to her.
"You would have thought that Klenx is my corporate sponsor.
I remember what they put on my tombstone?
"She was crying"
How the US - China trade war could be good for Beijing
The initial years of the trade war between the US and China were slowing and while the war is far from over, the rift between the countries could be beneficial to Beijing in the long run, experts said.
US President Donald Trump said the first warning was given earlier this year by imposing major Chinese export taxes, including on solar panels, steel and aluminium.
The most significant increase this week with new tariffs affecting up to $200 billion (£150 billion) worth of items effectively taxes more than half of all goods coming into the US from China.
Beijing has retaliated in its own way every time, most recently by slapping tariffs of five to 10 percent on $60 billion of U.S. goods.
China has promised to match the US shot - by - shot and the world's second largest economy is likely to be on the verge of collapse.
Getting Washington back means hollowing out on demands, but publicly bowing to the US would be too embarrassing for Xi Jinping, the president of China.
Still, experts say Beijing can make its move, the US trade war could positively support China in the long run while reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
"The fact that a hasty political decision in Washington or Beijing can create situations that either initiate economic tailspin in the country is actually more dangerous than what was previously seen by the audience", said Abigail Grace, a research associate who focuses on Asia at the Center for New America Security, a think tank.
Syria is 'ready' for the return of refugees, says Foreign Minister
Syria said it was ready for the voluntary return of refugees and appealed for help to rebuild the country, devastated by more than seven years of war.
Speaking to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid Al-Ma'lum said that conditions in the country are improving.
"Today, the situation on the ground is more stable and secure because of the progress made in countering terrorism", he said.
The government continues to resettle in areas destroyed by terrorists to restore normalcy.
The country now has all the conditions for the voluntary return of refugees due to terrorism and unilateral economic measures that target their daily lives and livelihoods.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
Another six million people living in the country still need humanitarian assistance.
Al-Ma'lum said the Syrian regime would welcome help in rebuilding the devastated country.
But he insisted that it would not accept conditional aid or assistance from countries sponsoring the insurgency.
Europe wins the Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team won the 2018 Ryder Cup by defeating the US team by a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National outside Paris, France.
The U.S. has now suffered six consecutive defeats on European soil and has not won a Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
When Danish captain Thomas Jorn's teens reach the 14.5 points needed to beat the Americans, Europe regain their title.
American star Phil Mickelson, who struggled in the maximum tournament, showed his t-shot in the water on the 16th hole, over 3 by accepting a match from Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari won all of his rounds, becoming the first of 4 players to go 5-0-0 since the tournament's current format began in 1979.
American Jordan Speith was beaten 5 and 4 by Denmark's Thorbjorn Olesen, the lowest ranked player on the European team.
The world's top-ranked player, Dustin Donson, lost 2-1 to England's Lan Poulter, who had perhaps played his last Ryder Cup.
A veteran of eight Ryder Cups, Spaniard Sergio Garcia has become the European to win every time in the tournament with 25.5 career points.
"I don't usually cry, but today I can't help myself.
It was a difficult year.
So thank you Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm very, very happy to have the cup back.
It 's about the team, and I 'm very happy that I could help", Grazia said emotionally after the European win.
He held the torch to his partner John Ram, who beat American golf legend Tiger Wood 2 and 1 in a single play on Sunday.
"I'm incredibly proud to beat Tiger Wood, I grew up watching him", said Rahm, 23.
Wood lost all four of his matches in France and now has a 13-21-3 career Ryder Cup record.
One of the greatest players of all time has won 14 major titles, second only to Jack Nichols.
The U.S. team struggled all weekend to find a fairway with the exception of Patrick Reid, Justin Thomas, and Tony Finney, who played golf with Caliber throughout the tournament.
American captain Jim Furyk said after his squad's disappointing performance, "I'm proud of these guys, they fought.
In the morning we put some pressure on Europe.
We defeated them.
Congratulations to Thomas.
He is a good captain.
All 12 of his players played a great game.
We'll regroup, I'll work with the PGA of America and the Ryder Cup committee and move on with Thosem.
I love these 12 boys and I am proud to be their captain.
You should salute them.
We played better".
