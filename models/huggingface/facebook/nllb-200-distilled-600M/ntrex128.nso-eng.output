Members of the Welsh Assembly (AMs) are concerned that they will appear like monkeys
Some Assembly members have complained about the proposal to change their name to MWP (Welsh Members of Parliament).
This was due to the existing plan to change the name of the meeting to the Parliament of Wales.
Members of the Assembly on all sides of the political spectrum fear that this is a mockery of themselves.
One in the Department of Labor who is a Member of the Assembly says that his team is concerned that this issue is relevant to the Twp and Pwp".
For non-Walesan readers: In Welsh twp means "crowd" and pwp means "cock".
A Plaid Party Assembly member recognized the whole group as happy and made suggestions.
A member of the Welsh Conservative party said his party was open to a name change, only to say that it was a shortened form of the word for a puppy appearing on the MWP Puppet Program.
In this context, the letter w in Welsh is pronounced in the same way as the letter you call it in Yorkshire English.
The Assembly Commission, which is now drafting a bill to change the name, said: "It is clear that the final decision on any vote on the members will be on the members themselves".
The 2017 Government of Wales Act gives members of the Welsh Assembly the power to change its name.
In June, the Commission announced the decision after consulting the public on the motion and found that a majority of the people supported the call for the meeting to be called the Parliament of Wales.
In the matter of how Assembly Members are called, the commission prefers to be called Members of the Welsh Parliament or WMPs, but the choice to be called MWP has gained much public support.
It sounds as if the Assembly Members are proposing a change of name, but reaching an agreement may require them to go to the Interlocutor, Elin Jones, who is expected to sign the official name change motion within a few weeks.
The rule of change will include other changes to the way the meeting operates, including removing Assembly Members from their seats and the structure of the committee.
Members of the Assembly will have the opportunity to decide what they want to be called when the time comes to debate this law.
Macedonians go to the polls over the change of the country's name
On Sunday the voters will decide whether they want their country's name to be changed to the Republic of North Macedonia".
These general elections were held to resolve decades-long dispute over neighboring Greece, which also includes a province called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of the neighboring northern country be given as its place and has repeatedly opposed it from entering the elections to become a member of the EU and NATO.
The Macedonian president, Gjorge Ivanov, who opposes the name change, said he would throw the election to the stakes.
But voters, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, say they should buy EU and NATO membership by changing the name.
The St. Martin's Cathedral Collapses as Churches Strike Harlem
"In the history", said Mr. Adams, "the adults I spoke to were in every corner with a church and boys", Mr. Adams said.
"Today there is none".
He said the disappearance of bears is understandable.
These days, "people are having a variety of entertainment", he says.
"The barracks are no longer the holiday homes that the townspeople used to go to".
But in the case of churches, he says he is concerned that the money from the sale of goods will not last as long as the leaders recall, "and soon they will be back on the scene.
He also says that churches are being replaced by apartment buildings full of people who will help the remaining places of worship.
"Most of these apartments will be bought by white people and they will expedite the closure of these churches completely because it is unlikely that the majority of people will live in those apartments who will be members of these churches", he said.
Both churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black city - where in 1870 it was called the Metropolitan Community, and ten years later it was not called St. Martin's.
The original white Methodist congregation left in the 1930's.
Then a black congregation that had been gathering nearby took over the building.
St. Martin's was taken under the leadership of Rev. John Howard Johnson, who led the blockade of 125th Street, the main shopping street in Harlem, as the stores there refused to hire or promote black people.
A fire in 1939 destroyed the building, but Father Johnson's clergy drew up plans to rebuild it, restoring the church's cast iron work.
Father Johnson's son and successor at St. Martin's, the pastor David Johnson, proudly called it "the hope of the poor".
The scholar who played the instrument in July called it another: "A cultural treasure" and "an instrument that has historically been unreplaceable".
The expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, said that it was the world's first pipe organ played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who 18 years ago played a larger pipe organ at the Riverside Church.
Mr. Merriweather said St. Martin's had no one else for him.
What happened in St. Martin a few months ago became a riot among architects and contractors, some brought by church leaders of lower rank, while others were brought by the Episcopal diocese.
The council - the church's governing body, made up of lay leaders - wrote a diocese in July complaining that the diocese would require the costs to pass to the council, but the council was not included when hiring architects and contractors sent by the diocese.
Some customers complain that there is no transparency in the daosese section.
Shark hurts 13-year-old boy when he jumps to find lobsters in California
Officials say a 13-year-old boy was attacked by a shark on Saturday in California while hunting for lobsters on the first day of the lobster season.
The attack occurred early at 7 a.m. near Beacon's Beach, Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he and his friends had been barking for about half an hour on a Saturday morning when he heard a boy crying out for help, and the group rushed to get the boy out of the water.
Hammel says that at first he thought it was the joyful sound of catching a lobster, but he realized that it was a worm that said It was one!
It's one!'
Hammel said that as soon as he reached the boy he noticed that his chest was torn.
"I called out to everyone: 'The sword is in the water!'" Hammel said.
The boy was rushed to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego by plane and is reported to be in critical condition.
The species of the shark that attacked him is unknown.
Captain Larry Giles, a marine patrolman, told the media that the shark had been spotted a few weeks earlier, and it was considered not a dangerous species.
Giles insinuates that the victim has severe chest wounds
Officials have sealed off from Ponto Beach, Casablad to Swami's, Ecinitas for 48 hours for security and security.
Giles noted that there are over 135 species of sharks in the area, but most of them are considered harmless.
Sainsburys projects enter the UK beauty market
Sainsbury's competes with Boots, Superdrug, and Debenhams by creating stores with beauty shelves and specialized services to customers.
As part of a major move to enter the UK beauty market of some £2.8bn, a market that continues to grow as fashion and home appliances fall, large beauty shelves have been installed in 11 stores nationwide and, if successful, will be added to other stores next summer.
This investment in beauty is reaching the point where supermarkets are finding ways to use the large spaces on shelves that once housed TVs, microwaves, and home appliances.
Sainsbury's says it will double the number of beauty products to 3,000 products, including Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman, and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
The existing L'Oreal, Maybelline, and Burt's Bees will also be given more space to label such items as those found in Prostitution shops.
The supermarket also opens its own makeup boutique so that most products are free of animal-polluted ingredients - a requirement that many new buyers have.
In addition, the fragrance retailer, Fragrance Shop, will use additional shelves for its products at two Sainsburys stores, the first of which opened last week in Croydon, south London, while the second will open late this summer in Selly Oak, Birmingham.
Online shopping and the new way of buying small amounts of food every day in nearby shops have made supermarkets experiment with how they encourage people to shop.
Mike Coupe, chief executive of Sainsbury's, said that small shops will eventually become like supermarkets as supermarkets try to fight off discount stores like Aldi and Lidl by offering more services and ending the sale of food.
Sainsbury's has been putting Argos's small stores in hundreds of department stores and has added several Habitats stores after buying those stores two years ago, which it says has raised the price of groceries and increased revenue.
Past efforts by supermarkets to revive the beauty and pharmaceutical sectors have failed.
Sainsbury's experimented with Prostitution in the early 2000's, but the partnership was dissolved when a dispute arose over how the money in the store's pharmacy was distributed.
The new policy came after Sainsbury's sold its 281 pharmacies to Celesio, the owner of Lloyds Pharmacy, for some 125 million pounds (£125m), three years ago.
It says Lloyds will contribute to the project by adding premium leather cosmetics including La Roche-Posay and Vichy brents to four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury's chief commercial officer, said: "We have changed the appearance of our beauty products to improve the opportunity for our customers.
We also use specially trained ones who will be willing to give advice.
Our various brands of products are designed to meet all people's needs and the appeal of our stores and the proximity of our shops means that we are now a popular beauty shop that challenges old shopping habits".
Peter Jones is suspected after Holly Willoughby withdrew from a £11million deal
Peter Jones, a fan of Dragons Den, has left the show after TV presenter Holly Willoughby withdrew from his £11m lifestyle lease deal to focus solely on his new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willoughby has no time for their household goods and other Truly rental appliances.
The two's business was likened to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop lease.
The 37-year-old anchor of This Morning wrote on Instagram that he was quitting.
Holly Willoughby left the Dragons' beloved Den, Peter Jones, furiously retreating from their promising last-minute affair - to focus solely on his new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources say Jones was "cheering" when the TV personality admitted during a tense meeting on Tuesday at his headquarters in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that his new business deal - of 1.5 million pounds (£1.5 million) - charged him with not having enough time to advocate for household goods and other Truly branded appliances.
The deal was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop's and was expected to double Willoughby's estimated fortune of 11 million pounds.
When 37-year-old Willoughby announced on Instagram that he was leaving Truly, Jones flew to one of his holiday homes in Britain.
"It was really the main thing for Holly", said the source.
It would be a long-term future job that would carry him for decades.
His decision to withdraw left all involved in shock.
No one believed what was happening on Tuesday, the business was about to be liquidated.
The goods to be sold are packed in the warehouse at Marlow HQ".
Experts believe that the departure of this This Morning host, who is among Britain's most successful investors, could cause the company to lose millions of dollars because of the large investment in furniture of various types such as mattresses, candles, clothing, and furniture, or it could delay the launch of the factory.
It can mean the end of a long-standing friendship.
Willoughby, a mother of three, and her husband Dan Baldwin were close friends of Jones and Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby organized Truly and Capp in 2016, and Jones, 52, took over as chairman in March.
The families went on vacations together, and Jones owns 40 percent of the Baldwin TV production company.
Willoughby will no longer be the M&S news anchor and replaces Ant McPartlin as host of ITV's I'm A Celebrity.
Last night a source near Jones said "We can't talk about his business".
We should be "brethren in love"
He was so slandered that he was to be published in the press for speaking words that were considered inappropriate for the president and for trusting the North Korean leader.
Why is President Trump so frustrated?
Trump spoke in a ridiculous way as if he were reading the news.
"I have given up nothing".
He said Kim was interested in meeting him again after they met in Singapore in June where Trump hailed it as a major step toward the elimination of nuclear weapons in North Korea.
But discussions on the elimination of nuclear weapons have been heated.
More than three months after the meeting held in June in Singapore, North Korea's top diplomat, Ri Yong Ho, told world leaders of the U.N. General Assembly on Saturday that the North does not see a "same-minded" U.S. side on the steps North Korea has already taken to disarm.
Instead, he said the U.S. is continuing to impose enforcement sanctions designed to maintain the existing tensions.
In his impeachment speech Trump showed a optimistic view of the situation.
He said: We work well with North Korea.
"We were fighting North Korea.
Many people could have been killed.
Now we work well together.
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim have yielded good results - no more rocket tests, no more prisoners of war being released, and no more American soldiers being sent home.
He advocated an unusual approach when discussing his relationship with Kim.
"It's very easy to be president, but instead of 10,000 people crashing outside the stadium where they want to crush themselves into the crowded space! we have only about 200 people standing in jealousy", Trump said, pointing to the crowd in front of him.
Tsunami and Earthquake In Indonesia Damages the Island, Hundreds Die
After the earthquake in Lombok, for example, NGOs in other countries were told that they were no longer needed.
Although more than 10 percent of Lombok's population had disappeared, it was not declared a national disaster, as international aid requires to provide.
"Unfortunately", said Ms Sumbung, "in many cases it has been made clear that international assistance is not needed, so the situation is almost difficult to handle".
Although Save the Children is organizing a team to go to Palu, it is not clear whether foreign workers will be allowed to work at the site.
Mr. Sutopo, a spokesman for the national disaster relief organization, said Indonesian authorities were reviewing the situation in Palu to see if international organizations could be allowed to contribute to the relief effort.
As Indonesia is constantly hit by earthquakes, the country remains unwilling to deal with this disastrous natural disaster.
Although shelters have been built for people to flee to in the aftermath of the Aceh Tsunami, such facilities are not available in areas near other beaches.
The obvious fact that there is no alarm in Palu to warn people of the Tsunami, despite the various warnings, may have contributed to the deaths of many.
During the usual situation, it has been difficult to get from one of the many Indonesian islands to another.
Now natural disasters make it even more difficult to navigate.
A hospital ship stationed in Lombok to treat the earthquake victims is heading for Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the wreckage.
President Joko Widodo said that his main concern was to improve Indonesia's slums and roads when he campaigned, and he spent a lot of money on roads and railroads.
But there is a lack of money in Mr. Joko's system for the next elections next summer.
Mr. Joko is also facing the pressure of possible divisions due to tensions in Indonesia, where many Muslims have stuck to their old system of belief.
More than 1,000 people have been killed and tens of thousands have fled their homes as Christian and Muslim groups fight in the streets, using vicious knives, bows, arrows, and other formidable weapons.
Shebella: Daniel Sturridge of Liverpool balancing points against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge defended Liverpool from the risk of losing to Chelsea in the Premier League when he scored in the 89th minute on Saturday at Stamford Bridge, London.
Sturridge was hit by a ball from Xherdan Shaqiri just under 30 metres away with Chelsea's figures, during which his team would lose 1-0.
He hit the ball with his left foot before dragging it into the ball.
The ball went up the box and toward the right corner of the scrolls.
From there the ball went down and passed over the leaping Cape Arrizabalaga and entered the net.
"I tried to be there, to get the ball and games like Shaq often go as far as they could, so I tried to take as much time as I could", Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kante come and step on it once, rather than think about shooting a shot".
Chelsea had led 1-0 in the half after the Belgian striker, Eden Hazard, scored the point 25 minutes into the game.
The point-crossed in the Blue passed the ball on the heel to return it to Mateo Kovacic in the game, before striking in the middle of the field and running into the middle to get to Liverpool's numbers.
Kovacic got the ball and immediately passed it to the center fielder.
He then kicked a beautiful ball that penetrated the bowling alley and led Hazard into the box.
Hazard left the carpenters and drove it to the sidewalks with his left leg, where it passed Liverpool's Alisson Becker.
Liverpool will face Napoli in the Champions League group stage at 3 p.m. on Wednesday, at the San Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea are facing Videoton in the UEFA Europa League at 3 p.m. on Thursday, London.
The death toll from the tsunami rises to 832 in Indonesia
On Sunday morning, the national disaster organization announced that the death toll from the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia had risen to 832.
The Society's speaker, Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, told a press conference that many people were still trapped under the rubble of collapsed buildings when the earthquake of 7.5 magnitude on Friday caused waves of about 7 meters high.
The city of Palu, with a population of over 380,000, was surrounded by the rubble of collapsed buildings.
Police arrest 32-year-old man suspected of murdering a woman stabbed
An investigation is underway after a woman's body was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside this morning.
A 44-year-old woman was found at 7.55am with gunshot wounds in Grayson Mews, John Street, and a 32-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of murder.
The police called on the local people to report the incident to those who witnessed it.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: "The investigation is still early but I call on anyone near John Street, Birkenhead who has seen or heard any suspicious objects to contact us.
I also appeal to anyone, especially taxi drivers, who may have had the front cameras in their cars take the event to contact us as they may have information that could benefit our investigations.
The police station confirmed that the woman whose body was found was a Birkenhead and was found in the yard.
This afternoon friends who thought they knew the woman arrived at the scene to ask where she was found this morning.
The investigation is ongoing, as the police have said, and they are about to tell the relatives of the deceased.
A taxi driver who lives in Gryson Mews has just arrived and tries to enter his apartment, but the police tell him that no one is allowed to leave or enter the building.
He was stunned to find out what had happened.
Residents are told that it will take hours before they are allowed to return to the building.
One policeman was heard telling a man that the whole occasion was seen as the scene of the crime.
A woman dressed in sheep led the way to the scene.
He repeats the words this is the title.
By 2 p.m. two police vents were inside the restricted area while one was outside.
Many police officers were standing inside the restricted area, guarding apartments.
Anyone with information is requested to contact DM @MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Crime Prevention without confession on 0800 555 111, and refer to the number 247 of 30 September.
Cromwell Parliamentary Monument becomes the latest monument to the debate over rewrite history
Removing it would be a fitting punishment for the Taliban-like damage he caused to many artistic and religious artifacts in England, destroyed by his zealous Puritan followers.
But Cromwell's party described Mr. Crick's proposal as "a foolishness" and an attempt to rewrite history.
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Society, said: "There was no way that the current dispute over the removal of the statues, and Oliver Cromwell's outside the Palace of Westminster, would not be attacked.
The cultural and religious damage during the English civil war was not Cromwell's.
Perhaps Cromwell was wrongly punished for the actions of his grandfather Thomas, who lived hundreds of years ago.
The fine way that Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft describes Cromwell is evidence of the 19th-century sentiment and a written account of a man who many believe is still important to remember.
Mr. Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: Many, especially in the 19th century and beyond, considered Cromwell to be a parliamentary defender against external pressure during his rule.
Whether that is a complete truth or not is a matter of history that will continue to be debated.
The fact is that the revolution that took place in the middle of the 17th century changed the progress of our society, and Cromwell feels that he was one of those on the other side of that divide.
His achievements as Lord Protector are also worthy of celebration and memory.
A Rabid Pig Walks Through a Chinese Farmer to the Death
According to news reports, a farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a market in southwestern China.
The Morning Post reported on Sunday that the man, who was declared Yuan, was found dead with a perforated heart valve, in a blood valley near a pigsty in the market of Liupanshui, Guihou province, South China.
A pig farmer prepares to vaccinate pigs from their nest on May 30, 2005, in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
He reportedly went with a cousin from the neighboring province of Yunnan on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs at the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead, and the door of the pig barn was almost unlocked.
He says that inside the cage was a large male pig that had been trampling blood in his mouth.
According to the report, forensic tests confirmed that the pig weighed about 249 pounds [249 kg] and a half and killed the farmer.
His cousin, who is nicknamed Wu, was quoted in the Guiyang Evening New as saying: My cousin's feet were covered in blood and stained.
A security camera caught Yuan entering the market at 4:40 a.m. on Thursday to feed his pigs.
Her body was found an hour later.
The animal that killed the man was not Yuan's or his cousin's.
The market manager told the Evening News that the pig was kept out of the way so that it would not attack again, while the police were gathering evidence at the scene.
Yuan's family and market officials reportedly were discussing condolences for his death.
Although not so common, there have been reports of cases where pigs attacked humans in the past.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, leaving a man with serious injuries.
Ten years ago, a pig weighing some 295 pounds slammed a Welsh farmer in a trailer until his wife frightened the animal.
After a farmer was eaten by his pigs in Oregon in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs rarely come out of the wild but if they taste blood, they can attack.
He said: They like to play.
They are like children, curious ... their purpose is not to harm you.
It is not up to you to respect them.
The remains of the Rhinoceros Rosa bring abundant rain to the southwest of the United States
Psychologists say that the Rhinoceros Rosa loses its strength as it heads toward the cold waters off the northern coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will bring torrents throughout northern Mexico and the southwestern U.S. in the coming days.
Rosa had thunderstorms of 85 mph, Category 1 Hurricane, from 5 a.m. on Sunday Eastern time, and was detected at 619 miles (619 km) southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to head north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a thick wind begins to blow into the Pacific Ocean and heads east toward the U.S. West Coast. As Rosa approaches Baja in the California plateau on Monday, a tropical storm will begin to move the tropical moisture northward to the southwest of the U.S.
Rosa will bring about about 25 inches [25.4 cm] of rain in parts of Mexico on Monday.
Now, tropical moisture combined with strong winds will cause heavy rainfall in the southwest in the coming days.
In this area, rainfall of between 2.54 and 10.16 centimeters can cause devastating floods, followed by thunderstorms, and mudslides in the desert.
The extreme tropical heat causes rainfall of about 5.08 to 7.62 inches per hour, especially in the southern parts of Nevada and Arizona.
About 5.08 to 10.16 inches of rain are expected in parts of the Southwest, especially Arizona.
Floods can occur depending on the severity of the weather due to the heavy rainfall in the tropics.
It would be unwise to walk into the wilderness because it may not rain in the tropics.
Heavy rain can turn the swamps into flowing rivers and thunderstorms can bring storms and dust.
A heavy wind is approaching and will bring heavy rains to parts of the coastline and southern California.
A foot-deep rainfall may cause a few bumps and cause roads to slip.
This will be the first rainfall in the area during this rainy season.
The thunderstorms and four tropical rains will be in Arizona Sunday evening until Monday morning, before finally prevailing Monday evening until Tuesday.
Heavy rain will cover the Four Corners from Tuesday to Wednesday.
In October, the United States will experience a cold winter in the Arctic, but in the tropics, the temperature will remain warm.
This sometimes results in large temperature changes after a short period of time.
There is a fine example of a marked difference in U.S. central areas on Sunday.
The temperature difference of about 20 degrees is between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
In the next few days, the warm summer air will begin to return.
Most of the central and eastern regions are expected to warm in October and cover the 80s from the Southern Plains to the Northeastern part.
On Tuesdays New York City may be warmer to 80 degrees, or about 10 degrees above normal.
Forecasts show that there is a high probability that the temperature will be above normal in the eastern parts of the U.S. until mid-October.
More than 20 million people watched the Brett Kavanaugh trial
More than 20 million people watched on six television stations the witnessing given on Thursday in the heated trial of Supreme Court justice Brett Kavanaugh and his wife, Christine Blasey Ford, who accused him of molesting her in the 1980's.
Meanwhile, as the political side was still in a heated debate, a regular Friday session was interrupted at the last minute to deliver this announcement: Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake agreed that the FBI conduct a week-long investigation into the charges.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that he knew without a doubt that Kavanaugh had been listening to him as a lion and tried to strip him while at a high school party.
Kavanaugh, with all his senses, gives evidence that he knows perfectly well that that did not happen.
Nielsen reported on Friday that perhaps more than 20.4 million people had watched the trial.
The company was reading the total of viewers on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel, and MSNBC.
The figures were not yet available for other stations that broadcast it, including PBS, C-SPAN, and Fox Business Network.
Nielsen also often has trouble counting office viewers.
To see how many people, it is the same number of people who watch a football match or when the Academy Awards are presented.
Nielsen said Fox News Channel, whose broadcasters strongly support Kavanaugh's nomination, had the highest viewership of any channel, with 5.69 million viewers during the entire trial that day.
ABC was the next with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million viewers, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million, and CNN 2.52 million, said Nielsen.
After this trial, people have become more interested.
Flake was the main character on the Friday event.
After a moderate Republican office issued a statement supporting Kavanaugh's nomination, he appeared on CNN and CBS cameras on Friday morning, surrounded by protesters, as he tried to ride an elevator to the trial before the Judicial Committee.
He stood up and stared down for a few minutes as he was being filmed in front of a CNN camera.
"I'm standing right here", said one woman.
"Do you think you are telling the country the truth?
She was told, "you were strong when many women were weak".
Flake said that his office had delivered the speech and that before the elevator sounded, he would speak more at the committee hearing soon.
The media circulated the case for hours, until later the Senate Judiciary Committee had to decide whether to support Kavanaugh's sanctity.
But Flake said he would do so, knowing that the FBI would investigate the charges against the saint next week, as several Democrats have been promoting.
Flake was somewhat convinced when he spoke to his friend, Senator Chris Coons, a Democrat.
After talking to Coons and several senators, Flake made a decision.
Flake's vote was powerful because it was clear that the Republican Party would not have the vote to approve Kavanaugh before the poll was conducted.
President Trump has launched an FBI investigation into charges against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May says critics are 'politically biased' on Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May said in an interview with the Sunday Times that critics of her plan to leave the European Union had "destroyed politics" about Britain's future and undermined national interests.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives in Birmingham, Britain, on 29 September 2018, for the Conservative Party Meeting.
In a close interview on the front page of the newspaper, his former foreign minister Boris Johnson launched an attack on what is called the Prime Minister's (Chequers plan) plan for Brexit, saying the proposal that Britain and the EU should collect tax payments from each other "is really a dream".
Wayde Sims dies of gunshot: Police arrest accused Dyteon Simpson over the death of LSU player
Police have arrested a defendant in the shooting death of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old LSU basketball player.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, was arrested and sent to a halfway house on charges of manslaughter, said the Baton Rouge Police Department.
Officials released a video of Sims and Simpson's confusion, and the police said Sims lost his brakes during the fight.
The police found the bugs in the area and found Simpson's DNA in them, a CBS report working with WAFB.
After questioning Simpson, the police said he admitted to shooting Wayde and killing him.
His bond is valued at $350,000, according to the Attorney's report.
The East Baton Rouge Parish Coroner's Office released a public report on Friday, saying the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the head and the bullet to the neck.
The department has recruited a special search force for a fugitive from the Louisiana Police, a national crime investigation lab, a Southern University police officer, and local residents to assist in the full investigation by arresting the suspect.
LSU's team manager Joe Alleva thanked the space officer "for doing the job thoroughly and ensuring justice is done".
Sims was 20 years old.
The 6-foot-6 forward was a benefit to Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, was also an LSU basketball player.
Last year, he averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team was "dirty and "in shock" at Wayde's death.
"This is something you always worry about", Wade says.
A volcano that burns coal in Mexico City
When the Popocatepetl volcano erupted, its coal reached villages on the southern outskirts of Mexico City.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention warned Mexicans to move away from the hot mud after the mud erupted and reported 183 exhaust gases and ash in 24 hours.
The center was watching for the roaring and trembling in some places.
New pictures of friends in the media show a thin layer of coal painted on car windows in suburban Mexico City such as Xochimilco.
Since the September 2017 earthquake that struck central Mexico with a magnitude of 7.1, stone experts have noticed an increase in the potential for mudflow in a region 72 kilometers southeast of the capital.
Since 1994, the "Don Goyo" mudslide has been a threat to the environment.
Police mingle with Catalan independence activists before the anniversary of the independence elections
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after pro-liberty protesters joined the riot police, and as thousands marched to mark the first anniversary of Catalonia's vote for full independence from Spain on the grounds of their race.
A group of masked independence activists were stopped by riot police, beating the police with eggs and painting them with a light paint, which was filled with a black cloud of dust on the streets that often crowded with tourists.
Later that day, further riots broke out as the police used police rifles to stop the fighting.
For hours the independents cried out, "We will not forget, we will not forgive and the activists of the trade unions shouted, "Live and let go of Spain".
Fourteen people were treated for minor injuries they sustained in the crash, according to a local newspaper report.
In a climate of independence in which we are confronted by the summer after the elections of October 1, which the Spanish government has declared illegal but favored by Catalan independence supporters.
Voters voted in a staggering majority for independence, although the number of those who came was low compared with those who opposed Catalan independence, most of whom opposed the elections.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last summer after police tried to block elections in the constituency where violent riots broke out.
Independence groups had sat outside Friday night to prevent purges in support of the national police.
The effort continued but they were forced to change their plans.
Narcis Termes, a 68-year-old electrician who joined the independence movement with his wife, said he had no hope that Catalonia would ever gain independence.
"Last summer was the most wonderful time of our lives.
I watched my parents tear up joyfully when they were able to vote but now we stand with the man on the ballot", she says.
Although Catalan independence parties succeeded in winning a landslide victory in the regional elections in December last year, they have struggled to keep people on the same page this summer, as most of their leaders have fled or are in jail awaiting trial for their role in organizing those elections and have declared independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded protests in support of the police on her phone, said that the confusion was caused by politicians on both sides.
"The tension is getting worse", he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders who has been in prison awaiting trial, announced that he would be a candidate for the European Parliament election next summer.
"Being a candidate for the European elections is the best way to show that I do not accept the opposition to the democratic policies and the oppression we have seen in the Spanish government", he says.
Londonderry: Men arrested after a car burned down a house
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested after a car burned a house in Londonderry repeatedly.
This event occurred on Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at about 7:30 BST.
Sensory sensor Bob Blemmings knew that it had damaged the gates and the building itself.
It is also possible that the car was shot at some point.
Livingston defeats Rangers 1-0 for a blood draw
Dolly Menga scored her first point that helped Livingston win the game
Livingston had just been promoted to the Rangers, stunned when Steven Gerrard was defeated for the second time in 18 games as coach of the Ibrox club.
Dolly Menga's luck was the difference between the two teams, with Gary Holt's team equalled by points and Hibernian in second place.
This season Gerrard's team has not played a Premiership game away from home and next Sunday they face the leaders at the Hearts, leaving them eight points behind.
Prior to that, the Rangers hosted the Rapid Vienna European Liking on Thursday.
Meanwhile Livingston confirmed that they had not lost six games in the series, and coach Holt had not lost since taking the bones from Kenny Miler on the dead moon.
Livingston gave up opportunities against its flying visitors
Holt's team had to get ready long before they hit the point, with their tracks causing the Rangers endless problems.
Scott Robinson got a chance but played by chance when his ball passed the scores ahead, and Alan Lithgow's ball went away after finishing trying to find the ball shot in the head by Craig Halkett that passed the scores ahead.
The local team was content that Rangers played early, knowing that they could cause problems for the visitors if they had been laid down.
And that is how the important point was clarified.
Rangers caused a free-kick and Livingston got the hole, Declan Gallagher and Robinson worked together to put Menga in a good position to pick up the ball, and tie it to the net in the courtyard circle.
At the time, the Rangers had held the ball for a long time but found the back wall of the home team tight and no obstacle Liam Kelly was not interested,
This practice continued until the second half, although Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly to stop the ball.
Scott Pittman was severely injured in the leg of Rangers' striker Allan McGregor and Lithgow pulled a large distance on one occasion when Livingston had gained a set kick.
Rangers kept throwing the balls at Livingston's box and holding them, while the goalkeeper refused two pen requests - one after Halkett had thrown Glenn Middleton from the bench, and one for holding the ball in his hand.
Livingston's work - when we throw away
Alasdair Lamont of the BBC Scotland at the Tony Macaroni Arena
Livingston has done a fine job with good decisions.
They were astonished, continuing to excel beyond expectations even in the worst of circumstances.
There has been little change in their numbers and in the staff since they returned to the big leagues, but we are raising Holt up the ladder as he has done for the team since he arrived.
He has a lot of goats.
Captain Halkett was handsome, skillfully repairing the back wall, while Menga did not give Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall a shot in the entire game.
The Rangers were not up to speed.
Although they were sometimes under Gerrard's command, they lacked such qualities.
Their ball was weak - they only hit the back wall once - and that's what Rangers should stand for with their feet, as it's in the middle.
Erdogan received differently in Cologne
The skies were blue and the sky was blue on Saturday (September 29) when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast in Berlin.
It is the final day of President Erdogan's provocative German visit - one designed to restore relations between NATO allies.
They are not consistent on certain issues affecting human rights, freedom of expression, and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Then Erdogan headed to Cologne to open a new mosque of the Aztec Empire.
The city has a large population of Turks outside Turkey.
The police said that for security reasons they prevented a strong crowd of 25,000 people from gathering outside the mosque, but a crowd of supporters rushed to see its president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan activists - mostly Kurds - also expressed their views, teasing Erdogan's schemes and the German government's decision to accept him.
The two-sided protests show the courage of a visitor who is being taken as a hero by the German Turks and as a tyrant by others.
Accident on the Deptford street: A bicycle rider dies in a car accident
A cyclist died in a car crash in London.
The accident occurred near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy street in Deptford, southeast of the city, about 10:15 BST.
The driver stopped and emergency services arrived, but the man died there.
The accident comes months after a cyclist died after being burned by a fugitive on Childers Street, about a mile and a half from the scene of the accident on Saturday.
The city police said that government officials were struggling to identify the man and to notify the owner.
Roads are paved and buses are being diverted to other routes in the area, and drivers are encouraged to avoid the possibility.
Long Lartin Prison: Six Constables wounded in the mud
Six constables are locked in a barrel of a hard-forgotten prison, says the Bureau of Prisons.
A riot broke out at the Long Lartin HMP prison in Worcestershire around 09:30 BST on Sunday and is continuing.
The name "Tornado" was given to the special Costabals to control the riot, which included eight prisoners and was banned on one side.
These constables were treated for minor facial injuries in the area.
A Prison Services lawyer said: "Specially trained prison officials were sent to deal with the ongoing situation at HMP Long Lartin.
Six workers were treated for seizures.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons, nor do we believe that those responsible will be sent to the police and will be in the house for a long time".
HMP Long Lartin has more than 500 inmates, including the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June it was reported that the prison warden was hospitalized after being attacked by a prisoner.
And in October last summer riot control squads were called to the prison to control the red-hot war where workers were attacked with nuclear balls.
The Pink Panther Raids Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with the Leumatha-producing Storms (Dry Seasons Can Be Happy)
A mild storm rarely strikes Arizona, but that is likely to happen early next week when Tropical Storm Rosa will extend its remaining strength into the Desert Southwest, and it may result in the risk of thunderstorms.
National Weather Service has issued thunderstorm warnings on Monday and Tuesday for Arizona westward into southern and eastern Nevada, southern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to make a direct trip to Phoenix on Tuesday, overtaking Monday night in the rain.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix tweeted that only ten seconds of tropical and subtropical cyclones have been strong or without a storm that has moved some 320 miles [200 km] in Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was the smallest of the two that flew 40 miles [64 km] in the AZ valley".
Recent excavations at the Mahodiotswana National Center predict 5 to 10 inches of rain, and here and there about 15 inches of rain at Mogollon Rim in Arizona.
In some areas of the Southwest Desert, including the central Rockies and the Great Basin, they may reach 2 to 5 inches, and here and there they can reach up to 10.
The rose will be a blessing rain in areas affected by drought, where there is no risk of rainfall from the sumatha.
While floods never feed the crops, some rains can be of great help as the Southwest is now covered by drought.
According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, more than 40 percent of Arizona has a severe drought, the second highest since the top", according to a report by weather.com.
First, the Little Rose will bring rain throughout the Mexican state of Baja California.
Rosa, with a moderate wind force on Sunday morning, will have a gale force of 137 kilometers per hour, 619 kilometers south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, and then northward at 19 kilometers per hour.
The storm will meet the cool waters of the Pacific and cool down.
So it is expected to arrive in Mexico in the heat of a tropical storm on Monday afternoon or early in the afternoon.
Rain across the Mexican border can be severe, causing severe flooding.
"We can expect 7 to 15 inches of rain from Baja California to northwestern Sonora, with a possible rainfall of up to 25 inches", reports weather.com.
Now Rosa will pass north through Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona valley early Tuesday as a calm storm, then ascending past Arizona into southern Utah on Tuesday night.
"The greatest danger to Rosa or its remnants is the avalanches in Baja California, northern Sonora, and the U.S. Desert Southwest", according to the National Hurricane Center.
These rains are expected to produce thunderstorms that could kill humans and dragons in the deserts, and rock breaks in mountainous areas.
Midsomer Norton: Four people arrested for attempted murder
Three boys and a 20-year-old man have been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old boy was found with knife wounds in Somerset.
The boy was found wounded in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton, about 04:00 BST on Saturday.
He was taken to a hospital where he is said to be in stable condition.
A 17-year-old boy, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man were arrested at night in Radstock, Avon and Somerset, police said.
The police are urging anyone who may have taken a video of the incident with their cell phone to investigate.
Trump says Kavanaugh has been 'abused by the vicious, angry' Democratic Party
"Voting for Judge Kavanaugh is voting against the Democratic Party's main and the Democratic Party's main policies", Trump said at a party rally held in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said that Kavanaugh has been "outraged by the Democratic Party's vicious, angry attitude" since his election.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, denying the yellow and heartfelt charge that he had taunted Christine Blasey Ford decades ago when she was a teenager.
Ford also testified against the charges.
On Saturday, the President said that on that day "the American people saw Kavanaugh's wisdom, character, and courage".
"Voting for Judge Kavanaugh is voting to honor one of the most brilliant jurists of our time, a lawyer with a distinguished history of public service", he said before a crowd of supporters in West Virginia.
The president spoke indirectly of Kavanaugh's nomination when he spoke of the importance of the Republican primary in the midterm elections.
"There are only five weeks left before one of the most important elections of our time.
I'm not just a candidate, but a real candidate", Trump said.
"That's why I'm running for the best candidates in the country".
Trump argues that the Democratic cause is "opposition and disruption".
The main vote for Kavanaugh's nomination is expected to take place in the Senate on Friday, the senior deputy of the GOP leadership told CNN.
Hundreds of people die in earthquakes, tsunamis in Indonesia, and the number is increasing
At least 384 people have died, many of them injured, as massive waves hit the shores, as a massive earthquake and tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, according to a report by authorities on Saturday.
Hundreds of people had gathered on the beach in the city of Palu on Friday to celebrate when a six-meter-high wave hit the sandy beach as the sun set, killing many people and taking advantage of anything it encountered.
The tsunami was followed by a magnitude 7.5 earthquake.
"When the tsunami threat came yesterday, people were doing their jobs on the coast and did not immediately flee and become blind", Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman for BNPB's Indonesian disaster prevention agency, briefly told Jakarta.
"The tsunami did not come on its own, it dragged cars, cottages, houses, hit every dry area", says Nugroho, adding that the tsunami was traveling across the sea at 800 kph (497 mph) before hitting the coast.
He says that some people cut down trees to escape the tsunami and save themselves.
Some 16,700 people were evacuated from 24 villages in Palu.
Aerial photographs published by the disaster department show that many buildings and shops have been destroyed, bridges have twisted and collapsed, and the mosque is surrounded by water.
On Saturday, the coastal city was in trouble.
Several earthquakes were felt in areas with a population of 2.4 million.
The Indonesian Bureau of Assessment and Application of Technology (BPPT) said that the energy released by the Friday earthquake could be 200 times the energy of the atomic bomb that was made in Hiroshima during World War II.
You know, the location of the city, on the tip of a long, narrow gorge, could have made the tsunami worse.
Nugroho described the damage as "great", saying that thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls, and hotels were destroyed.
The bodies of some victims were found buried beneath the ruins of the buildings, adding to the 540 injured and 29 missing.
Nugroho said that there could be casualties and extensive damage along a 300-km-long coastline north of Palu, in a region called Donggala, near the epicenter of the earthquake.
The discussions in Donggala "were completely interrupted and we know nothing about it", says Nugroho.
There are over 300,000 people living in jealousy", said the Red Cross, adding that its workers and volunteers were heading to the affected areas.
"This is already a problem", he says, "but it can get worse".
The organization was severely criticized on Saturday for not informing people that the tsunami had struck Palu, although government officials said the waves had not yet reached the time of the warning.
A video recorded by a mere human was posted on the media platforms showing a man on the top floor of a building shouting loudly warning people on the street below of the coming tsunami.
A few minutes later a wave of water washed up on the shore, dragging apart buildings and cars.
Reuters was not able to immediately determine the authenticity of the video.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a massive power outage that cut off discussions in Palu and made it difficult for the elderly to organize rescue operations.
The army has begun sending relief planes from Jakarta and other cities, the majority say, but the rescued need other basic necessities urgently.
The city's airport has been reopened for relief efforts only and will be closed until October.
President Joko Widodo plans to visit the refugee camps in Palu on Saturday.
The Indonesian Tsunami Kills More than 800.
What a sad news.
When World Vision personnel from Donggala arrived safely in the city of Palu, where workers were hiding in tents set up in the courtyard by their office, they passed through a disaster on the way, says Mr. Doseba.
"They told me that they saw many houses destroyed", he says.
What a sad news.
Even as relief groups began to prepare to provide relief, they lamented that foreign relief workers with a lot of experience were being barred from entering Palu.
Under Indonesian laws, relief, relief, and other necessary supplies from other countries may begin to enter the area of emergency if the area is spread as a disaster area.
This has not yet happened.
"It is still a province-level decline", says Aulia Arriani, a spokeswoman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"As soon as the government says, 'This is a national disaster,' we can open up international aid but the situation is not there yet".
When the second shark catches Palu after the earthquake and tsunami on Friday, friends and relatives of the missing are hopeful that their loved ones will miraculously appear alive in the news of the natural disaster.
On Saturday, a young boy is found in a barn of cockroaches.
On Sunday, rescuers rescue a woman who had spent two days under the sea with her mother's body near her.
Gendon Subandono, the Indonesian national paragliding coach, had trained two missing paragliders for the Asian Games, which ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
Others are housed at the Roa Roa Hotel, including Mr. Mandagi, and his students.
"I am as much of a paragliding champion as I am of a mental health crisis", he said.
Mr. Gendon told how hours passed before the news spread that Roa Roa Hotel had fallen to athletes and paragliding lovers, he sent WhatsApp messages in fear to Palu athletes, who were celebrating on the beach.
But his messages were uncountable, with only one horn, indicating that he had gone with a little horn, not with two gray horns.
"I don't think these messages worked", he says.
Thieves take away $26,750 in addition to an ATM at Newport Levee
On Friday morning, thieves stole $26,750 from a Brink employee who was attaching an ATM at Newport in Levee, according to a news report from the Newport Police Department.
The driver of the car had taken money out of an ATM in a recreation center and arranged to transfer another amount, Detective Dennis McCarthy wrote in this account.
While he was busy, a man "came running after Brink's work and stole a purse of money brought.
Witnesses who witnessed the incident saw a group of suspects flee the scene, according to the report, but the police did not say how many were involved.
Anyone with information on how to identify suspects should contact the Newport police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper changes name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West changes his name - to Ye.
Announcing a name change on Twitter on Saturday, it wrote: "The person officially known as Kanye West".
West, 41, has been known by the nickname Ye for some time and has used the moniker as the title of his eighth album, released in June.
This change comes first on Saturday Night Live, where she is expected to release her new album Yandhi.
The program's creator says that it replaces singer Ariana Grande in the program who has withdrawn from the program "for reasons of emotional distress".
In addition to being the abbreviation of his current name, West once said that this voice was an important part of his faith.
"I believe 'ye' is a word that occurs most often in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'o,' or wena" West said earlier this summer when discussing the title of his album with the host of the radio program Big Boy.
"So I am you, I am we, we are.
I moved from Kanye, which means alone, to Ye - just to show our goodness, our badness, our frustration, everything.
This album is a mirror of who we are".
He is one of the most famous rappers who changed their names.
Sean Combs is known variously as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy, or Diddy, but this summer he has published whether he likes the names Love and Brother Love.
Former West's former bandmate, JAY-Z, also says that it doesn't matter whether or not a root or a capital letters are inserted.
AMLO of Mexico vows that no more military use against civilians
The president of Mexico, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, vowed that the military would never again be used against civilians as the country approached the 50th anniversary of the complete bloodshed of students.
On Saturday Lopez Obrador promised in Tlatelolco Plaza that "never will the military be used to attack the Mexican people".
On October 2, 1968, soldiers opened fire on a peaceful plaza march, killing 300 people during the sweeping spread of student social movements in Latin America.
Lopez Obrador vowed to support young Mexicans by providing monthly financial support to students and opening many public universities for free.
He said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities have led to gangs.
The U.S. should double the funding for AI.
With China's focus on technology or artificial intelligence, the U.S. should double its research spending, says AI expert and investor Kai-Fu Lee, who has worked with Google, Microsoft, and Apple.
These words come after various parts of the U.S. government have issued announcements about AI, since even the U.S.A. does not have a solid AI policy.
On the one hand, China announced its plan last summer: it aims to be No.1 in AI innovation by 2030.
"Doubling the AI budget would be a good start", says Lee, "since the U.S. has outgrown all other countries, and we are almost left, and we expect to discover the next things in AI".
Lee told CNBC this week that double paying expenses could increase Al's chances of great success in the U.S.
Lee, whose book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published last month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which invests in one of the most prominent AI companies, China, Face++.
In the 1980's he worked on the Al system at Carnegie Mellon University, which invented the American Othello, and later became the head of Microsoft Research and president of the Google branch in China.
Lee paid tribute to the U.S. government's achievements in contests such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's Robotics Challenge and asked when the next one would be, so that he could give suggestions.
Lee said U.S. researchers should work hard to get government approvals.
Lee said that China does not hire experts; it employs companies.
Facebook, Google, and other tech companies have hired university students in recent years to work for Al.
Lee knows immigration policies can also help strengthen Al's U.S. efforts.
He said he thought that people with Al's PhD should be given green cards.
The Chinese National Council issued the Next Scheme for Artificial Intelligence Development in July 2017.
China's National Natural Science Foundation provides funding to the people of the academy in the same way that the National Science Foundation and other government agencies support U.S. researchers, but the quality of education in China is low, Lee said.
Earlier this summer the U.S. Department of Defense established a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, designed to unite staff and students, and the White House announced the establishment of a Special Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
And this month DARPA announced that it has invested $2 billion in a project called AI Next.
As for NSF, it now invests $100 million a summer in AI research.
Meanwhile, for months, the U.S. legislature has done nothing to create a National Security Agency on Artificial Intelligence.
Macedonians go to the polls to declare whether or not the country's name has been changed
Macedonians go to the polls on Sunday to decide whether or not to change its name to the "Republic of North Macedonia", which will resolve the longstanding dispute between it and Greece, which has refused to join the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, says that the name of its northern neighbor indicates that it is breaking its territory and refuses to become a member of NATO and the EU.
The two kingdoms agreed in June to propose a new name, but opponents argued that changing the name would affect the mass Slavic culture of Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov said he would not vote in the elections and would not even support the campaign, which raised concerns about whether the crowd would come, so that they could make up at least 50 percent of the vote needed to make a decision.
The question on the ballot paper is: Do you even approve of membership of NATO and the EU in accordance with the conditions that Greece has set.
Supporters, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, say it is in Macedonia's best interest to change it to become a member of organizations such as the EU and NATO, since that country is one of those that emerged from the collapse of Yugoslavia.
"I came here today to choose the future of this country, to choose young Macedonians so that they can live free under the protection of the European Union because that means that we all will live in security", says 79-year-old Olivera Georgijevska, who lives in Skopje.
Although the law does not bind them, several members of parliament have said they will support the decision to resolve the issue.
To change the name, it would take two-thirds of the members of parliament to support it.
The national election committee said that there were no reports of injuries at 1 p.m.
But only 16 percent of those who voted were in the 2016 parliamentary elections, compared with 34 percent of those who voted in the 2016 parliamentary elections, where 66 percent voted.
"I will vote for my children, since we live in Europe", says Gjose Tanevski, 62, who lives in Skopje.
Macedonia's Prime Minister Zoran Zaev and his wife Zorica and their son Dushko voted in the elections whether or not to change the name of Macedonia, which would open the door to attend the NATO-European Union summit in Strumica, Macedonia, on September 30, 2018.
Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, set up a few seats in front of the parliament in Skopje, near the tents of those protesting the elections.
"We agree with the NATO and the EU", says Kavadarkov, "but we don't want to get into what we know, not just the blackheads.
We are a poor nation, but we have dignity.
If they want to welcome us from Macedonia, we can still move to other countries, such as China and Russia, and join the Euro-Asia organization.
Prime Minister Zaev says that NATO membership will bring much needed investment to Macedonia, which has more than 20 percent of the unemployed.
After Zaev cast his vote, he said: "I believe most people will agree with this because more than 80 percent of the population supports the EU and NATO.
He said that if the answer was yes, it would prepare us for the future.
A poll published last Monday by the Research Strategy Center of Macedonia says that between 30 and 43 percent of voters will vote, a low number needed.
A survey conducted by Macedonian Telma TV found that 57 percent of those polled plan to vote on Sunday.
Of those, 70 percent said they would support the idea.
To pass the resolution, more than 50 percent of the electorate must vote.
The failure of this decision will hamper the government's policy of promoting independence from Western nations, which has been in power since May last year.
Shebella: Sergio Aguero of Manchester City crosses the streets of Brighton to make a point
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling broke through Brighton's doors when Manchester City beat them 2-0 on Saturday at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made it seem as if the wounds were moving on their own just as he hit the point in the 65th minute.
This Argentine goalkeeper handed the ball in the middle of the field and took it from there.
He slipped between three Brighton players, crossing the field.
Aguero then finds himself surrounded by four green shirts.
He crossed one of the five most important routes to Brighton.
He turned left and struck Sterling.
The English forward also returned the ball to Aguero, who kicked it with his right foot to score Mathew Ryan of Brighton.
City manager Pep Guardiola told reporters that Aguero still has a foot problem.
We thought he would play 55 or 60 minutes.
But look what happened.
We are glad that he got the ball.
But it was Sterling who first gave the Sky Blue a lead in this Premier League competition.
That point came in the 29th minute.
Aguero found the ball surrounded by many Brighton players.
He threw a good ball to Leroy Sane from the left side.
Sane grabbed it before dragging Sterling, who was on the other side of the math.
The Blue Heavens hit the spot just before the tide began to rise.
City will play Hoffenheim in the Champions League at 12:55 p.m. on Tuesday, at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena and Sinsheim Stadium, Germany.
Scherzer wants to miss the Rockies
Since the Nationals have withdrawn from the competition, there is no longer much reason to force injuries.
But since Scherzer doesn't like to be defeated, he wants to play a little game on Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but he will only play if the Rockies are likely to continue in the competition, having defeated the Los Angeles Dodgers in one game, the NL West.
The Rockies were able to beat the Nationals 5-2 on Friday, but they were still working on winning the first-team trophy.
While we will not get anything after the game, we will at least be able to please the crowd in Denver and the other team we will be playing with will be playing very well this summer.
Why would I not want to participate in that contest?
The Nationals will then name the players who will start the game on Sunday, and it is reported that Scherzer may be included in the game.
Scherzer, who will be in the starting lineup for the 34th time, played well on Thursday and will lead again on Sunday.
The right-handed Washington player has a 18-7 record with a 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings this season.
Trump conducts a summit in West Virginia
The president spoke of the position regarding his saint in the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, when he spoke of the importance of Republican supporters overwhelmingly supporting the midterm elections.
All our achievements will be put to the test in November.
We are just five weeks away from the most important decisions.
This is not just a matter, I'm not just a fan, but I'm really a fan, I'm just running around and running for the right candidate", Trump said.
Trump went on to say, "You'll see these Democratic directories, you've already seen them.
They are determined to take over any form of government, showing that they are wicked and cruel.
He does not care who he hurts to get to power, all he wants is power and government, and we will not give them to him.
He said the Democrats were campaigning against the disruption.
He said, "You've seen that in the last four days" and said the Democrats are angry and mean, cruel and untrue.
He spoke about the Senate Judiciary Committee and quickly named Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein, which the audience did not like.
Do you remember his response?
Did you provide the documents?
Uh, uh, what?
No, no, slowly, slowly, slowly, slowly, slowly, slowly, slowly, slowly, slowly, slowly, slowly, slowly, slowly, slowly, slowly, slowly, slowly, slowly, slowly, slowly, slowly, slowly, slowly, slowly, slowly, slowly, slowly, slowly, slowly, slowly, slowly, slowly, slowly, slowly, slowly, slowly, slowly, slowly, slowly, slowly, slowly, slowly, slowly, slowly, slowly, slowly, slowly, slowly, slowly, slowly, slowly, slowly, slowly, slowly, slowly, slowly, slowly, slowly, slowly, slowly, slowly, slowly, slowly, slowly, slowly, slowly, slowly, slowly, slowly, slowly, slowly, slowly, slowly, slowly, slowly, slowly, slowly, slowly, slowly, slowly, slowly, and slowly.
Labour is no longer a church that caters to everyone.
Be patient when people express their feelings.
It was no surprise when the Momentums of my party chose me.
I am the last in a line of Labour candidates who have been told they are no longer welcome  just because of our opinion.
My fellow parliamentarian Joan Ryan was treated the same way because she stood firm against prejudice against Jews.
In my case, I was severely criticized for opposing Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of responsible economic policies, national security and Europe, but surprisingly, Jeremy also opposed past leaders on those issues.
The announcement that Nottingham East Labour would hold a meeting on Friday said, we want the meeting to be open to the public and free".
For the eight years I have been a Labour MP, the GC meetings held on Friday evenings have been that way.
Sadly, the political attitude now is no longer to promise people to treat them kindly and gently if such a thing ever happened.
It is becoming increasingly clear that the Labour Party no longer tolerates people with different opinions, and people's opinions are judged by what the party leadership says.
This began shortly after Jeremy became leader, as he was a political activist and he began to demand that I change my view on things I would never agree with on national security in the EU market.
Every time I speak publicly  no matter what I say  they will follow a stream of jokes on social media asking me to be removed, they oppose political issues, they tell me that I should not be a Labour party.
And I am not the only one who has.
In fact, I know that I am even luckier than some of my peers, because I am only politically disliked.
I admire the motives and determination of those who are constantly being bullied because of sex or race but who are not self-absorbed.
Another disappointment about politics these days is that mocking others seems to be a minor issue.
Last week Jeremy Corbyn said Labour should be patient.
The truth is that we are no longer a church that is inclusive, there is no more spirit of mistrust among us and the standards of sanctification are becoming more and more difficult.
I have been advised several times over the past two years to bow my head, be calm, and my wounds will heal.
But that is not what I am so jealous of in politics.
Since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago as a school student, angered by the Thatcher government's neglect of my school so that the buildings collapsed, I vowed to fight to improve public services to help those in need  whether as a chancellor or a government minister.
I have not hidden my views on politics, not even in the last elections.
No one in Nottingham East can say that he is not sure of my political position and the points on which I agree with leadership.
All I can say to those who support this on Friday is that if the country works towards Brexit will make it harder to hurt families, businesses and disrupt public access to services, I don't understand the issue and I don't want to waste my time and energy supporting the Labour leader.
But in truth my message is not directed to the Nottingham Momentum, but to the people in my district, whether Labour or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise that nothing will stop me from doing what I believe is in your best interests, whether it be threats of removal or political unrest.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Ayr before being defeated to the bottom
The final two tries changed the outcome in a flash, but Ayr was bound to win this exciting match for Tennent's Premiership that day.
This group, which has not yet been defeated in ten groups, is pulling ahead of the pack.
Finally, thanks to the strong back wall, as well as their good use of opportunities, which elevated the home team and coach Peter Murchie had good reason to rejoice.
"Our games have been difficult so far, and we have not lost, so my heart is white", says the coach.
"I'm so proud of Ayr", said Robyn Christie of Melrose, "they have used their opportunities better than us".
Grant Anderson's try in the 14th minute, which was scored by Frazier Climo, put Ayr ahead, but, Scottish player Rory Hughes was given a yellow card, was issued for the Warriors game, which made Melrose take the chance for the majority and Jason Baggot held a free try.
Climo extended Ayr's lead with a pencil, before cutting the cut, cut and made a solo try for Ary to cut 17-5.
But Melrose started the second half well and Patrick Anderson's try, which was won by Baggot, narrowed the gap by five points.
The game was delayed because Ruaridh Knott was badly injured, pulled out with a stick, and from the start again, Ayr opened a huge gap with a try by Stafford McDowall, which was overtaken by Climo.
Ayr's bowler, Blair Macpherson, was given a yellow card again, and Melrose once again took advantage of the try taken by Bruce Colvine, under great pressure.
But the home team came back, and when Struan Hutchinson was awarded a yellow card for throwing Climo out of the penalty line-out, MacPherson scored the point behind Ayr's scores.
Climo scored the point, as he did at the game's reboot, after Kyle Rowe kicked the ball thrown up by David Armstrong and later Gregor Henry, a sideman, kicked the home team's fifth try.
Still Game star seeks new green pastures in the restaurant industry
Still Game star Ford Kieran wants to enter the hospitality industry after it was discovered that he was appointed as the director of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old plays Jack Jarvis in a popular BBC program, which he writes and stars alongside longtime comedian Greg Hemphill.
Both have said that the upcoming ninth series will be the last in the program, and Kiernan seems to be planning on how he will live after playing Craiglang.
According to an official report, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The photographer declined to comment, although a reporter for the Scottish Sun reported that Kiernan wanted to get involved in a successful Glasgow restaurant business.
'This is our sea': Bolivia without a sea hopes that the union will pave the way to the Pacific
The sailors have forgotten the headquarters of the waterwall in La Paz.
Government buildings fly blue flags of the sea.
The depths of the water wall from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon are filled with the slogan: "This sea is ours.
It is our responsibility to bring it back".
Across the sea-less Bolivia, people remember the bloodshed that occurred when Chile forcibly seized the coast in the 19th century - and they long to sail back into the Pacific Ocean.
They have had that hope for decades, since Bolivia awaits an international court ruling on October 1 after five years of negotiations.
"Bolivia is a powerful nation, which says that power is unity and peace, and we certainly expect to win this case", says Roberto Calzadilla, Bolivia's ambassador.
Many Bolivians will watch the ICJ's decision on large screens across the country, hoping that the Hague court will represent Bolivia if - after decades of unusual negotiations - Chile should agree to negotiations to give Bolivia a seafaring trade option.
Evo Morales, the beloved and native president, who is fighting questionable campaigns again next summer - also has a delegation to attend the council's decision on Monday.
"We are very close to returning the Pacific Ocean", he swore at the end of August.
But some analysts agree that the court may not pass a verdict in favor of Bolivia - and it will be more likely if it does.
The United Nations Group of Four in the Netherlands said it had no authority to cede land to Chile, and it said it would not say what the outcome of the negotiations would be.
That the ICJ's decision was made only six months after hearing the final arguments, indicating that the case was not difficult, says Paz Zárate, a Chilean jurist.
Four years ago they still did not support Bolivia's cause, but they only delayed matters.
"The Bolivian government is now interfering in the process of reaching the sea unsolicited", said Zárate.
He pointed out that Morale had destroyed any kindness of Chilean because of his angry shouting.
At some point Bolivia and Chile will need to continue the talks, but it will be even more difficult to hold talks after the envy.
Since 1962, no country has admitted two ambassadors to another.
Former president Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, Bolivia's representative in The Hague, said that the court's decision was too urgent.
He said Monday would give Bolivia "an unusual opportunity to establish new ties with Chile" and an opportunity to "end 139-year-old disputes so that both countries can benefit".
Calzadilla objected that Morales - one of the most prominent Latino Americans - was using the sea to advance political issues.
"Bolivia will not give up its right to access the Pacific Ocean", he added.
"The court's decision will give us an opportunity to see what we need to avoid the past".
North Korea says it will not stop producing nuclear weapons unless it trusts the United States
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says that his country will not eliminate its nuclear weapons if it does not trust the U.S. Government.
On Saturday Ri delivered a talk at the United Nations General Assembly.
He called on the United States to fulfill its promises made at a meeting in Singapore between two non-combatant leaders.
He made the remarks as US Foreign Secretary Mike Pompeo was about to resume talks that had cut off nuclear weapons more than three months ago after the arrests with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
"It's a dent in ink to make the imposition of sanctions unshakable and to deny America the publicity that the Korean War is over that will make North Korea happy", says Ri.
The U.S. government has been anxious to accept the announcement unless the North Korean (Pyongyang) Government takes drastic steps to eliminate nuclear weapons.
Two leaders, Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump, are seeking a second meeting.
But many do not believe that the Government of North Korea is really determined to destroy the country's weapons, which the country perhaps considers to be the only way to remain secure.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for Kim's second meeting with Trump.
Paris fashion festivals reveal that red hats are on the shops in your street
If you want to get more hats and completely block the sun, you'll get them just by jealousy.
Fashion designers Valentino and Thom Browne produced a series of very large hats for their SS19 collection, which left people fascinated at the Paris Fashion Week.
Instagram is full of unusual summer hats and these designs have shown their amazing design on the models' tracks.
The highlight, according to Valentino, was a brown hat decorated with a small strap that was worn on the heads of models.
Other scars included jewelry-covered hoods, a gorgeous hat, and even a pineapple - but they were not designed to warm your head.
Thom Browne also noted that the choice of a mask was unusual - made just in time for Halloween.
Most colorful masks had sewn lips and were more like Hannibal Lecter than haute couture.
One design was similar to scuba diving clothes complete with snorkel and brass, while the other was a frozen ice cream cone.
And if you keep a lot of eye-catching clothes - you are blessed.
People who enjoy shopping say that we will soon see big hats in the stores.
The white hats will be a 'La Bomba' fashion, a very wide hat worn by Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The small label that drives these fancy-looking hats so prevalent in the media has given rise to a new style - beach grass bags that fit the swimsuit of the models.
Orange raffia bags, with raffia coats and a white leather handle on the top, were a prominent feature of the La Riviera SS19 collection of Jacquemus Paris Fashion Week.
Fashion enthusiast Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: 'I look forward to seeing big hats and sea bags in stores this coming summer - it will be difficult to make these grey wounds for yourself as the clothing designers put so much effort into it.'
John Edward: As a citizen of the world, you must know languages
Scottish private schools continue to excel, and this has continued in 2018 with further results in the best examinations, brought by individual and group success in sports, arts, music and other social activities.
These schools, with more than 30,000 students throughout Scotland, represented by The Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to provide students and parents with the best services.
Private schools seek to prepare students for advanced higher education, for the careers they choose, and even for their opportunity as world citizens.
Just as an educational institution can organize and implement its own curriculum, we continue to view the latest languages as popular and popular subjects in schools.
Nelson Mandela once said: "When you talk to someone in a language they understand, the matter ends in their head.
When you speak to a person in his own language, it reaches his heart".
This is a clear reminder that it is futile to rely on English alone if you want to build friendship and trust with people from other lands.
Starting with the results of the exams last summer, we see that the languages are ranked higher than other subjects in private schools.
68 percent of students who have studied foreign languages have passed the stars.
Data from 74 SCIS member schools showed that 72 percent of students had passed Mandarin with stars, while 72 percent of students had passed German, 69 percent of French and 63 percent of Spanish.
This shows that private schools in Scotland support foreign languages, as this is an important skill that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
In the curriculum of private schools and elsewhere, language choice as a subject is now seen as as as important as STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) courses.
A 2014 survey by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills found that 17 percent of employers who gave reasons for not filling vacancies were unable to speak a language.
So much language knowledge is needed to prepare young people for a bright future in employment.
Since many future employment opportunities will require the use of languages, this knowledge will be essential in a world where people are moving abroad.
Regardless of the profession a person chooses, if he or she learns a second language, he or she will have a good opportunity in the future to gain lifelong knowledge such as:
The ability to communicate directly with people from other lands gives a person who speaks several languages a better chance of success than others.
According to a 2013 YouGov survey of more than 4,000 adults in the UK, 75 percent were unable to speak a foreign language well enough to start a conversation, and French was the only language spoken by 15 percent of adults.
That is why investing in language education is now important for today's children.
Speaking several languages, especially those of developed countries, will equip children for better opportunities to get prominent jobs.
In Scotland, schools teach different languages.
Many schools will now be involved in highly advanced languages, while others will teach languages considered particularly important in Britain in preparation for the summer of 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child's preferences, there will always be a choice of languages in private schools, whose teachers are experts in those languages.
Private schools in Scotland are committed to providing an education that will prepare children and equip them with the necessary skills to succeed, no matter where they find themselves in the future.
Now it is undeniable that for a country to have a bright future, languages are vital in the work of foreign languages, and that should be evident in education.
Indeed, the latest languages should be viewed as "communicative skills".
Private schools are coming first in giving young Scots this choice, unlike being brilliant.
It must be well done.
John Edward director of the Scottish Council of Private Schools
LeBron will make his debut for the Lakers on Sunday in San Diego
The time fans have been waiting for to see LeBron James play for the Los Angeles Lakers for the first time has come.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play in the preseason game against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But the time to play is yet to be determined.
"It will be more than one for every under 48", according to Walton on the Lakers' official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James would play for a few minutes.
After training earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers' pre-season six games.
I don't need the first practice games this season to be ready
It's time for the Trump artist of West Virginia, YouTube Channel
President Donald Trump begins his election campaign tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia
It is the first of five trips scheduled for next week, including a visit to the friendly areas of Tennessee and Mississippi.
Regarding the short-lived suspension of the nomination vote to fill the vacancy in the Supreme Court, Trump is determined to create support for the upcoming midterm elections as Republicans are on the verge of losing Congress in the November election.
When is the West Virginia Trump show on the evening and how is it viewed?
Trump Wheeling, West Virginia's racing schedule is scheduled to begin at 7 p.m. ET on Saturday, September 29, 2018
You can watch Trump's West Virginia artist online below via a live stream on YouTube.
Trump may be giving a speech to the Supreme Court this week during the Brett Kavanaugh case, which was tense during the rape allegations because of the suspension of the confirmation vote for two weeks for the FBI to investigate
But the purpose of this series of interviews is to help Republicans facing a major challenge in November's elections to improve their position
That's why this campaign to attract voters has announced that the next five weeks are intended to motivate volunteers and supporters as Republicans try to protect and expand their majority in the Senate and House of Representatives, according to Reuters.
Congress's control is so important to his agenda that the president will go to as many places as he can get in during the busy election season, Trump campaign spokesman declined to be named, Reuters reported
Designed for the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, the evening carrier may bring backers from Ohio and Pennsylvania and will be featured in the Pittsburgh newscasts, according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be Trump's second visit to West Virginia this past month, a chance he won more than 40 percent of the vote in 2016
Trump has been trying to help Republican candidate for West Virginia Senate Patrick Morrisey, who is running late in the election.
It's not a good sign for Morrisey that the president is bound to try to help him in the election, said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
The 2018 Ryder Cup Team USA showcases the strength of the fight for hope when falling in the games of the players on Sunday
After three stages facing one direction, the Saturday stages may be exactly what the Ryder Cup needed
The level and temperature of the game are not the same in one team, but this is what players know and, especially in this type of competition.
Where, then, will the heat go?
"They had a six-point lead and now four, now I think we're going with that heat", Jordan Spieth said as he embarked on his solar journey.
Europe has a lead, therefore, with four points ahead and there are twelve to be played.
Americans, as Spieth says, feel more relaxed and more encouraging, not the Spieth and Justin Thomas type who played together all day and each one is bracing for three points out of four
Spieth has been a danger from hitting a ball on a stick to a flag and is an example to others.
The joy grew as he progressed, putting the important ball into the game to four points for all as he and Thomas were two points behind after two games.
His putt, which led them to 15 games and they shouted at him with joy, was a sign that he believed the American team had not left the competition.
"You have to be strong, and watch your game", Spieth said.
That's what the players have now
18 traps to identify oneself
The players with the most points over Spieth and Thomas the two days before are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, a legendary Ryder Cup contender.
Both are unusual but lovely from the outset and cannot make mistakes.
Moliwood were the only two who did not drive a bogey on Saturday afternoon, but avoided the bogey on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and back nine on Friday morning.
That game, and the enthusiasm from the fans to the fans, makes it a strong team on Sunday, and there will be no more famous player to complete the European championship at sunset in Le Golf National than Fleetwood and Molinari
It would be good if it happened at the same time in different pits
But the European natural languages are almost instantaneous
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson caught Sergio Garcia, the morning fourball winner, playing with Alex Noren
Bogey and two of the nine blades in front of him hit a Spanish and a Swedish man in a pit they could not get out of
On Sunday, even if no one is there to help you out of your hole
Fourballs and bonobos are enjoyable to watch up close because of the way both teams work together, their suggestions, their non-consecutive suggestions, and how the ball can be changed in a blink of an eye.
Europe have played well in the group stage to this point and they have a good lead on the final day but this four-man squad has shown that Team USA has the power to fight a fight that others, especially the United Stateside, still do not believe.
Europe takes a 10-6 lead into the Ryder Cup final
Europe will take advantage of a good lead in the Ryder Cup final after a good fourball game on Saturday and a good bowl game with a 10-6 lead against America
Tommy Fleetwood's two runners-up and Francesco Molinari set themselves up with two wins against Tiger Woods who pulled the back shoe to take their lead in the four-point Le Golf National
The Thomas Bjorn European team, still on the verge of winning the trophy they were stripped of two years ago at Hazeltime, had beaten the American team that missed the morning fourballs, winning the series 3-1.
America was good at the game, winning two games, but not being able to reduce the score
Jim Furyk's team needs eight points from 12 bowl games to win the trophy
Fleetwood is the first European player to score four consecutive points in his first season with Molinari, nicknamed Molliwood after a great weekend game by the second two to score four points from the first four games in Ryder Cup history
After defeating Woods and Patrick Reed in fourballs they joined hands well to catch Woods and the legendary Bryson Dechambeau with a 5&4 win.
Woods, who was out of the game for two games on Saturday, showed four shots but lost 19 of 29 games in fourballs and seven bouts in a row
Justin Rose , who took a break in the morning during a fourball game, returned to play alongside Henrik Stenson in the bowl games and beat Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka in 2&1 to finish first and third in the world.
Europe was not a nightclub, but their game was a fun one, a cool sunset southwest of Paris
Three-time winners Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set the two-point boat on Saturday.
They found themselves the 2&1 lead they gained from the Spanish fight John Rahm and Ian Poulter in fourballs and returned to catch Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4&3 in four-forties after losing the first two holes.
Only twice in Ryder Cup history have the team returned after a four-point lead to enter the unification games, although the Furyk champions need to play enough to defend the trophy
After two days of being away, even the little one seems to be unable to burn
North Korea says they will not abandon their weapons without confidence
North Korea's foreign minister warned the United Nations on Saturday that the ongoing sanctions are making America unreliable and that the country cannot abandon its nuclear weapons under such conditions.
Ri Yong Ho has announced at this summer's General Assembly that North Korea has taken important social measures last summer, such as stopping nuclear and missile testing, cutting nuclear testing opportunities, and taking an oath not to increase nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"We don't see an answer from America", he said.
Without trust in America there can be no trust in the security of our country and under these circumstances there is no way we can put our weapons first.
While Ri had raised similar arguments for Washington's nuclear weapons-launching plan in phases that North Korea would be rewarded for its actions, his speech was important because it did not refuse to lay down its own weapons as Pyongyang had used to.
Ri spoke at a joint speech between Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first meeting between the incumbent US president and the North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, while Kim vowed to serve to land nuclear weapons on the Korean peninsula while Trump confirmed the security guarantees for North Korea
North Korea has been seeking an official end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States has said Pyongyang must first abandon its nuclear weapons
Washington again steadfastly ended heavy penalties on North Korea
America is pushing for nuclear disarmament first and increasing pressure on sanctions to achieve their goal, and to oppose the declaration of an end to the war, said Ri
The idea that forced punishment will destroy us is a dream to strangers.
But the problem is that going on with the penalties makes us lose hope
Ri did not mention the plans for the second meeting between Kim and Trump that the American leader spoke about earlier this week.
The minister spoke of three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in five months ago and also said: If it was East Korea that was in talks to lay down nuclear weapons, not America, the laying down of nuclear weapons would still be a matter of concern
However, Ri's speech was so different from last year's, that he told the UN General Assembly that a missile strike on America could not be avoided after Trump called Kim a suicide bomber.
This summer at the United Nations, Trump, who last year threatened North Korea with a nuclear attack, commended Kim for taking the courage to lay down arms, but said much work still had to be done and the sanctions would remain in place until North Korea laid down nuclear weapons.
On Wednesday, Trump said there was no time limit for this, saying that if it would take two years, three years or months - it doesn't matter.
China and Russia disagree that the UN Security Council must pay Pyongyang for its actions.
But US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the U.N. Security Council on Thursday: The implementation of the Security Council's mandatory sanctions must continue swiftly and without hesitation until we have a stable, tested position to lay down nuclear weapons
The Security Council has been lifting sanctions on North Korea since 2006 when it tried to block the granting of funds for the purchase of missiles and other weapons
Pompeo met Ri at the U.N. General Assembly and said that after that he would visit Pyongyang again next month to arrange a second meeting
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this summer, but his last trip has not gone well
He left Pyongyang in July saying that the big job was done, but within hours North Korea was taking advantage of him for criminal requests
North Korea has pledged at a meeting with Moon this month that they will destroy the missile space and the nuclear space if the United States also fulfills the steps that must be completed.
He said Kim told him that the "necessary measures" he wanted were the security guarantees Trump had vowed to implement while in Singapore as well as the steps to restore good relations with Washington.
Harvard students learn by taking adequate rest
A new study at Harvard University this summer makes it possible for all students who do not graduate first to sleep more to break the habit of those already experienced to read caffeinated beverages so that they can read all night.
The teacher found that leading university students lack knowledge of the basic point of self-care
Charles Czeisler, Professor of Sleep Medicine at Harvard Medical School and a fellow at Brigham and Women Hospital, conducted this study, which he believes is the first of its kind in America
He was influenced to start a study after a speech disorder about the effect sleep deprivation can have on learning
At the end of it, a girl came to me and said: 'Why don't you tell me about this now, I've been in the senior class this summer
He knew no one had ever told him about the importance of sleep - it surprised him, wrote The Telegraph
This lesson, introduced to students for the first time this summer, explains the importance of getting good sleep in classes and sports, as well as improving their overall health.
Paul Barreira, Professor of Psychology at Harvard Medical University and Director-General of Health Services, said the University decided to introduce the study after finding that students were sleeping poorly during the week
This hour-long study included a series of collaborative activities
In one section is a picture of a dorom room, where students press coffee cups, curtains, trainers, and books to feed them on the effects of caffeine and the glory and how insomnia can impair the performance of an athlete, and the importance of having a cavity of sleep time
In one case, the participants point out how insomnia can cause heart disease, stroke, depression, and cancer.
A map of the campus, with signs pointing to the conversations, then encourage the participants to reflect on their daily activities.
We know that it will not change the habits of students at once
But we believe they have a right to know - just as you have a right to know the consequences of choosing to smoke,Prof Czeisler added
The practice of night-time surfing is still alive, he said, stressing that the latest technology and the ever-increasing pressure on students means that the problem of insomnia will increase
Ensuring adequate, quality sleep must be a student's secret weapon to prevent stress, fatigue and mood swings, he said - and to prevent obesity, because not sleeping causes the brain to starve, to stay tired all the time
Raymond So, a 19-year-old California chemistry and physics biologist, helped Professor Czeisler organize this course, after attending one of the courses last summer during his first summer at Harvard
He says that the study opened his eyes and moved him to conduct a study open to all on campus
The next step, he hopes, will be to invite all students with first grade to come to the same course before going to competitive institutions
Professor Czeisler suggests that students should consider creating a bedtime alarm, as well as a wake-up alarm, and pay attention to the danger of the green skylight from electronic devices on the screen, which can cause sleep deprivation, leading to sleep problems.
Livingstone 1-0 Rangers: The Menga score knocks Gerrard's men down
The Rangers saw themselves in danger again as he was beaten in his first game as Dolly Menga's point hit the ball against Steven Gerrard's team, who had collided, losing 1-0 to Livingston.
Ibrox were looking for their first win at the ground since their last defeat in February in 4-1 at St Johnstone, but Gary Holts gave Gerrard their second batting title in 18 games as coach to leave the club eight points behind in the Hearts's Ladbrokes Premiership draw.
Menga hit the point seven minutes before the draw and the Rangers had no good shot, so they didn't seem to be scoring
Rangers are down to sixth place, Livingston to third place, and Hibernian are on the points table
And there may be more problems for the Rangers after the scout Calum Spence had to be treated after he got a head wound, he was stabbed in the head.
Gerrard made eight changes in the team that beat Ayr to make it through to the final.
Holt, on the other hand, also took the Livi 11 lead at Hearts last week and he must be happy to follow the way his team played well, pressing them to do what they always did
Rangers might have been the best catchers, but Livingston took advantage of the opportunity to catch the ball well
They might have scored a point in the two minutes of the game when Menga gave Scott Pittman a shot and gave him Allan McGregor's numbers early but the half-time was when he missed a big opportunity
Keaghan Jacobs sent a free kick that got captain Craig Halkett but his fellow player Alan Lithogow pulled it aside from the back count
Rangers tried to defend themselves but were not very promising on the side of the action
Alfredo Morelos admitted that he had to have won the penalty fifteen minutes after he and Steven Lawless had clashed, but the referee said the game was going on despite the Colombian protests.
Rangers only managed to score twice in the first round of the match but former Ibrox defender Liam Kelly was not impressed by Lassana Coulibaly's headline and shortstop Ovie Ejaria's
Although Levi's point in the 34th minute came unexpectedly, no one can deny that they were entitled to it simply because of their work.
The Rangers also lost by defending the Jacobs' pitch set.
Scott Artfield was not shaken when Declan Gallagher handed the ball to Scott Robinson, who took his time before handing the one Menga put in the net.
Gerrard worked during the break when he removed Coulibaly to Ryan Kent and the break almost immediately changed the situation when the player on the wing surrendered to Morelos but Kelly came running from the line to defend.
But Livingston made the guests play their favorite game, Lithgow and Halkett often throwing long balls
The Holts team might have increased their lead in the final minutes but McGregor stopped to block the Jacobs ball before Lithgow hit it in the head and passed the numbers from the corner.
Rangers outfielder Glenn Middleton had another chance to make a penalty protest when he turned himself in to Jacobs but also when Thompson stopped looking at him.
Almanac: The Discovery of the Geiger Counter
Now a page from the Sunday Morning Calendar: October 30, 1882, 136 years ago today, COUNTING....the day the German scientist Johannes Wilhelm Hans Geiger was born
Geiger came up with a cave to monitor and measure radioactivity, a device that eventually led to the Geiger Counter.
This has been a pioneer in Science ever since, Geiger Counter pioneering in pop music, as in the iconic picture Bells of Colorado, where scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans are being humorously portrayed
Man What is that?
Rogers: It is the Geiger Counter, used to monitor radioactive waste, such as uranium.
When you insert these ears, you will hear the atoms being ejected by the radioactive material in the tissue
Evans: Yes, they eat on the ground!
Hans Geiger died in 1945, a few days before his 63rd birthday
But the bearers of his name are still alive.
A new cancer treatment can teach the body's immune system to detect defective immune systems
A new cancer treatment can teach immune systems to see the wrong immune system kill
The cure teaches the body's immune system to recognize the body's faulty immune system as part of the treatment
The leaf is a removal of the immune system from the patient, to be repaired in the laboratory
Now they will be able to see the protein from many fungi and then reproduce
Tested treatments show promising signs for cancer patients
A woman who took a drug, which trains the body's immune system to detect defects, saw a tumor in her uterus disappear for more than 18 months.
The lesion is used to release the patient's immune system, prepare the lab to see which protein is found in the multiple cells called HER2, and then repaint the immune system.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, of the US National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our findings show that we have only a very promising cure.
HER2 is the driving force behind the growth of many types of fungi, including the spleen, uterus, tuberculosis, and bile, the professor explained.
A similar method of removing the immune system from the patient and teaching it to follow the cancer's immune system has worked to treat a certain type of leukemia.
Kanye West joins a campaign to speak out about Trump's values, wearing a MAGA hat, after appearing on SNL.
They're not going to go well for him
Kanye West was operated on Saturday Night Live after dancing a night out with American values President Donald Trump and said he would run for election in 2020
After singing a song that night, called Ghost Town where she wore the Make America Great cap, she caused the Democrats a stir to emphasize her support for Trump.
I often talk to white people and they say, "How do you love Trump, you hate color?
If I had a concern about racism I would have been in America a long time ago, long ago, he said
SNL began the program by showing a sketch of Matt Damon where he jokes about Brett Kavanaugh as he stood before the Senate Judicial Committee under the allegations of gross misconduct filed by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although the lamb was not broadcast, a West's snow video was thrown off the social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It is unclear whether Rock intended to make fun of West by throwing it away.
West also complained to the press that the show was not enjoyable because of his hat
They beat me behind the station at four o'clock.
They told him, "Don't go out with that hat on".
They have deceived me!
Five of us are going down, he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued "Do you want to go to the bottom?" saying that he would throw away his superman jacket, because that means you can't do anything to me.
Try love.
His speeches called for the audience to talk to him, at least twice and the program staff seemed embarrassed, Variety reports, with one person shining a little light, The whole studio was silent
West was brought in at the last minute when Ariana Grande, a former Mac Miller, died a few days ago.
West surprised many when she sang I love it, dressed like a Perrier Bottle
West responded to TPUSA party leader Candace Turner by tweeting: To one of the militant spirit: I thank you for standing up against the movement
But the debate director Karen Hunter who tweeted West was presenting herself, and that's a very good thing.
But I choose not to give anyone a reward ((for buying their music or clothes or not supporting their art) which I think supports and speaks of dangerous political values to the people around me.
You have freedom.
He added to our list.
Before the show started, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying he is now officially known as Kanye West.
He is not the first musician to change his name and follows in the footsteps of Diddy, known as Puff Daddy, Puffy, and P Diddy.
Another rapper, Snoop Dogg took the name Snoop Lion as well as the composer not deceased Prince, he changed his name to Symbol and called himself the artist formerly known as Prince.

Game of Thrones actor Kit Harington exposes the habit of insulting officials
Kit Harington is known for drawing swords when he played Jon Snow in the HBO series Game of Thrones.
But the 31-year-old actor has broken the prevailing custom that a soldier must be a man, saying that such roles make boys have to be violent to be respected.
Speaking to Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he believed something was wrong and asked how to fix the gender pressure during these #MeToo times.
Kit, who recently married fellow Game of Thrones actress Rose Leslie, also 31, admits that she feels motivated to talk about it.
I feel like I'm on fire right now, where have we gone wrong in this regard of sexual oppression? he said.
What have we been teaching men as they grow, about the difficulties we see now?
Kit believes that television plays a role in their increased sexual tension, this is due to the actors on the stage.
He continued: What does a person experience and learn?
What is being taught on television, and on the streets, that makes boys feel on the side of this kind of manhood?
I think this is one of the most pressing questions of our time - how do we answer this?
Because there is clearly something wrong with boys
In the interview, he said that when he returns to Game of Thrones, when the series ends next summer, he has finished with battlefields and horses
From November Kit will be playing in Sam Shepard's re-imagined True West and it is the story of an illustrator and his brother, a cheerleader.
The actor said he sees his meeting with his wife Rose as a major achievement in Game of Thrones.
"I met my wife here on this program, and so you gave me my family, and my life from that moment on", he said.
Rose played Ygritte, who had won the attention of actor Kit Jon Snow, in this Emmy-winning play.
The two were married in June 2018 in the courtyard of Leslie's home in Scotland
HIV/AIDS China reports a 14% increase in new cases
China is reporting a 14% increase in the number of people infected with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people are affected in the country, health officials said.
At least 40,000 cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018 alone.
Most of the new cases are of a viral infection, bringing about a deterioration in the situation compared to the previous one.
HIV usually spreads more quickly in some parts of China because of infected blood.
But the number of people infected in this way had decreased and nearly reached a peak, health workers said at a meeting held in Yunnan province.
Each summer, despite this growth, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000.
HIV infection is a serious concern among LGBT groups.
Same-sex relationships were legalized in China in 1997, but LGBT discrimination has become rampant
Because of the changing customs, surveys have estimated that 70-90% of gay men eventually marry women.
Most infections are caused by insufficient protection in these relationships
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised to give HIV vaccines to everyone as part of the solution.
Maxine Waters objects to the work providing information from GOP senators, exposing dangerous lies and a robbery
U.S. On Saturday Rep. Maxine Waters denied the accusations that a member of her staff had posted personal details of three U.S. Republican senators on Wikipedia pages.
A Democrat from Los Angeles has said with confidence that the talks are being blocked by pundits and social media sites.
Writing on Twitter, Waters said: It's a lie, a green lie.
The information provided is said to include the home addresses and phone numbers of U.S. Senate members Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both of Utah.
The information appeared on the Internet on Thursday, sent by the anonymous Capitol Hill during the Senate hearing of Supreme Court saint Brett Kavanaugh, accused of racketeering.
This information was given after the three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
The Hill reported that Conservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address identifying the source of the person who sent the information pointed to Waters' office and provided the employee information along with Waters.
Waters went on to say: "These statements are false, green lies".
"My colleague - whose identity, personal information, and security have been exposed because of these scams and speeches - could not provide such information.
These baseless creatures are lies, green lies".
Soon Waters' speech was criticized on the Internet, including former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
Fleischer wrote: The way he refuses is angry.
"This shows that he has no desire to be a Congressman.
When someone is accused of a crime he did not commit, he does not have to be angry.
They should not be hardheads.
They should not doubt the accuser's motive.
They should calm down and calm down".
Fleischer apparently compared Waters' response to what the Democrats criticized Judge Kavanaugh, who their critics said appeared to be very angry at Thursday's trial.
Omar Navarro, the Morepublican candidate who wants to take Waters' seat in the midterm elections, also expressed his opinion on Twitter.
"This is a big story if it's true", he wrote on Twitter.
In his speech, Water said his office had informed the appropriate officials and law enforcement officials about the lies.
He continued: "We will ensure that these aggressors are exposed, and that they receive legal punishment for their destructive actions and put any of my colleagues at risk".
Johnny English Strikes Again - A low-budget film by Rowan Atkinson
It is now common to look at the importance of Brexit in any new film from a British perspective and seems appropriate for the revival of the Johnny English spoof franchise - which began back in 2003 with Johnny English and was revived again in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.
Will the first-rate punishments of a dog in this case of our folly be a new opportunity for the nation to send injuries abroad?
Regardless, the blonde Johnny English, in a miraculous way, has his license to surprise people and renew it a second time - a name that shows that he jokes about the look of wounds not done for non-Swedish movie lovers.
It is a sea monster whose bizarre ambition to gain fame has taken the part of Clouseau, Mr. Bean's puppet and a fellow puppet who sang one note in the song Chariots of Fire in London at the opening ceremony of the 2012 Olympics.
He also initially imitated the traveller and the mysterious man Atkinson, who had previously been featured in the long-forgotten TV commercials Barclaycard, leaving problems where he had gone.
There is one or two good things I have experienced recently.
I like Johnny English approaching the helicopter in old military uniforms and its bentman even cheating his garden.
Atkinson's gift for witchcraft has been shown, but the joke sounds less humorous and unnecessary, especially since hardcore films like 007 and Mission Impossible now faithfully portray witchcraft as a valuable joke.
It's as if the joke is for children rather than adults, and to me Johnny English's humorous tragedy is not as creative and emotional as Atkinson's silent films about Bean's personality.
The hailstones are proof that Great Britain is now in serious trouble.
The computer hacker has discredited Britain's great secret of espionage, naming all British operatives, which surprised the operatives - unfortunately Kevin Eldon played a minor role.
Consider the self-assuming prime minister as a cup of election and a violent, yet political orphan: Emma Thompson tries to imitate this kindness of Teresa-May but nothing can be written about her.
His advisers are shocked and tell him that since they have finished all the spies, he will have to pick up a pensioner.
And this means that the amazing Johnny English himself, who is now hired as a superintendent at a special school, but giving lessons without a record is a way to hide the stink: great movies like English promises the Academy of Rock.
English is quickly taken back to Whitehall for an emergency meeting and meets his long-suffering contemporary Bough, whose role is played by Ben Miller.
Although Bough is now a married man, he is assigned to the captain of a submarine, a boring little girl's role where Vicki Pepperdine is wasting her time.
So Batman and Robin, who are accustomed to misguided Her Majesty's Secret Service, have returned strong, meeting the attractive Ophelia Bulletova of Olga Kurylenko.
When the prime minister is caught in the dangerous trap of a billionaire soft-language technician, who claims he can solve British computer problems: misfortune-mongerer Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their morning odyssey that will leave you dead in laughter, disguising themselves as guardians, setting fire to a French restaurant; they start a small crime to enter the luxurious Volta ship; and English starts a riot as he tries to use a Virtual Reality headset to familiarize himself with the interior of the Volta house.
All the drugs are dropped because of this last event, but despite the friendship and the violence, there is still a children's TV to go around.
It is certainly not the same.
After watching other Johnny English films, I wondered: Does the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson the part that suits his talent?
Labour unions reject the idea of four days' pay for five days' work in Britain
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party will look at a major bill that will ensure that Britons work four days a week - but get paid five days.
The party is reportedly demanding that company executives pass on the savings from artificial intelligence (AI) to employees by giving them extra day off work.
This could result in workers having three days' weekends - but one day's pay.
These sources say that this idea would "cooperate" with the party's economic ambitions and plans to transform the land for the benefit of the working class.
Four-day work week was adopted by the Trades Union Congress as a way for workers to benefit from economic reforms.
A prominent Labour Party official told The Sunday Times: 'An announcement of a change of policy is expected before the end of the summer.
'This will not happen in a flash but to work four days a week is a desire in line with the party's approach to balancing the national economy in favour of labour as well as the party's overall industrial strategy.'
The Labour Party would not be the first to approve such a move, as the Green Party committed during the 2017 national elections to four days a week.
However, this desire is now not generally accepted by the Labour Party.
A Labour Party spokesman said: 'Four-day work a week is not the party's plan, and it is not a matter that the party has been discussing.'
Shadow Councillor John McDonnell used a Labour party meeting last week to examine his view of socialist economic change.
Mr. McDonnell said he was determined to take away 'uncharacteristic managers' and 'interest' power from the industries.
Shadow Chancellor's plans also suggest that current shareholders in water companies may not get all their money as the Labour government may 'rob money' for a mistake believed to have been made.
He also ensured that plans to put workers on corporate boards and to set up a Property Joint Venture Fund were to place 10 percent of private firm shares on workers, who could receive interest in summers of up to £500.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy tell "60 Minutes" whether FBI investigations of Kavanaugh can change their minds
The FBI's investigation of charges against Justice Brett Kavanaugh delayed his final nomination to the Supreme Court at least unanimously, raising questions about whether the court's findings could change the minds of any Republican members to give no support.
In an interview on Sunday, "60 Minutes" editor Scott Pelley asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could produce anything that would lead to their change of heart.
Kennedy was introduced to a fellow worker from South Carolina.
"I mean, I feel it", Kennedy said.
"When I went to the trial, I said, I was talking to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after the incident, to make the case, and said, 'Have you done this?'
He was firm, gnashing his teeth, and he did not know a lamb from a lamb".
However, Graham's vote seemed unchanged.
"I have made a decision on Brett Kavanaugh and a strong charge will be required to change it", he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett has rejected yellow", Graham adds, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And every man he speaks of himself cannot prove it.
Thirty-six years have passed.
I can see something new that can change".
What is Global Citizen's Day, and Has It Done Anything to Reduce Poverty?
This Saturday New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, a summer music festival where many real music festivals are celebrated and its purpose is also interesting: to end poverty in the world.
Now this year, the Global Citizen Festival will bring tens of thousands of people together to Central Park's Great Lawn not only to enjoy the music of Janet Jackson, Cardi B, and Shawn Mendes, but also to warn people of the real goal of ending extreme poverty by 2030.
Global Citizen Day, launched in 2012, is a continuation of the Global Poverty Project, an international group that hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people working to combat it.
To get a free ticket to the festival (unless you are willing to pay a VIP ticket), concertgoers were required to perform certain activities, or "steps" such as volunteering, sending emails to world leaders, making phone calls, or doing anything else to help raise awareness of the cause of poverty.
But how successful has Global Citizen been in reaching its goal with 12 years left?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert ticket a good way to get people to act, or is it just another form of "clicktivism" - people feel that they are making a real difference by signing an online petition or sending a Twitter message?
Since 2011, Global Citizen reports that it has reported more than 19 million steps taken by its supporters, with many different goals.
It says that these steps have helped to motivate world leaders to announce their commitment and policies of about $37 billion, which are designed to affect the lives of 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group received 390 commitments and announcements resulting from the actions it has taken, with at least $10 billion not being accepted or paid from the fund.
The group estimates that to date the funds received have directly affected the lives of some 649 million people worldwide.
Some key pledges are backing The Power of Nutrition, a U.K. alliance of committed investors "to help children thrive until they can fully use their talents", promising to help Rwanda with $35 million to end food shortages in the country after receiving more than 4,700 Twitter messages from Global Citizens.
"With the support of the British government, donors, governments, and Global Citizens like you, we can end the social injustice caused by malnutrition", The Power of Nutrition's spokeswoman Tracey Ullman told a crowd during a concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after taking more than 5,000 steps to call on the U.K. to clean up the nutrition of mothers and children, the government announced a fund for the project, Food Energy, which will save 5 million women and children with food.
In answering one of the questions and answers on its website, it asks, "What makes you think we can end hunger for food?"
"It will be a long and difficult journey - sometimes we will stumble and fall", said Global citizen.
But like the great human rights and separatist movements that have come before us, we will succeed, because power is unity.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are among the performers at this summer's New York festival, to be conducted by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
US could use the Navy "to understand" Russian energy exports - Interior Minister
If necessary the U.S. government could use the Navy to block Russian energy from entering markets, including the Middle East, says U.S. Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke, quoted by the Washington Examiner.
Zinke says that Russia has now become involved in the Syrian war - where it has sent in additional troops by a ruthless government - merely to seek new energy markets.
He reportedly said: "I believe the reason they are in the Middle East is that they want to sell energy as they have done in eastern Europe, in southern Europe".
And following this official, there are ways to combat this.
He said: "The United States has the ability to use its Navy, to ensure that seawalls are open, and, if necessary, to block, to ensure that their energy does not go to markets.
Zinke spoke to the audience at a meeting held by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a nonprofit group that has become a "consumer energy advocate" in the United States.
He went on to compare the U.S. government's dealings with Russia and Iran, saying that they are actually equally successful.
"For economic reasons Iran and Russia may choose to cut the border and exchange fuel", he said, referring to Russia as "another deaf cat" whose economy relies on fossil fuels.
The speech comes as the Trump administration plans to increase its exports of natural gas produced in Europe, which will export Russia, which sells iron to European customers.
As a result, Trump administration officials, even U.S. President Donald Trump himself, are trying to persuade Germany to back off the wrong Nord Stream 2 project, which Trump says has caused Moscow to rebuild Berlin.
Moscow has repeatedly stated that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 tunnel, which aims to increase the current capacity of the tunnel to 110 billion cubic meters, is a commercial project only.
The Russian government argues that the reason the U.S. Government opposed the project is purely economic and is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe we agree that energy is not a tool of oppression and that consumers have the freedom to choose their own suppliers", Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak put it after a meeting with US Energy Minister Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The US viewpoint has been called monkey after mountain, as Germany has assured that it will continue to support the project.
The leading German industry organization, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has called on the United States to break away from the EU's energy policy and the agreements reached by the German and Russian Governments.
"I am very concerned when another country becomes neutral in our energy issues", said Dieter Kempf, head of the Federation of German Industries (BDI) after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren Will Carefully Consider the 2020 Presidential Campaign, Says a Senator from Massachusetts
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday she would seriously consider running for president after the midterm elections.
While at the city hall in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren made sure that he would consider a recess.
"It is time for women to take over the administration in Washington and repair our corrupt, female-led government", according to The Hill, he put it.
"After November 6, I will seriously consider running for president".
Warren took President Donald Trump to the city hall, saying he was revolting the country.
"I am deeply concerned about what Donald Trump is really doing to our democracy", he says.
Warren publicly denounced Trump and his nominee for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh.
On Friday, Warren tweeted, "the FBI needs to investigate before we vote".
However, a survey released on Thursday shows that most of the constituencies that elected Warren do not think he should run for election in 2020.
According to a survey conducted by Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe, 58 percent of the likely Massachusetts voters say that the senator should not seek election.
32 percent support the idea.
A poll shows that many support former Governor Deval Patrick, with 38 percent supporting his own election, while 48 percent opposing it.
Other prominent Democrats who have been mentioned as candidates for the 2020 election include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would make an official decision in January, according to an Associated Press report.
Sarah Palin speaks about the PTSD of Track Palin at a Donald Trump party
Track Palin, 26, spent the summer in Iraq after being recruited in September.
Arrested and charged with domestic violence on Monday night
"What happens to my son, what happens to him after he returns, is like the PTSD effects that other families feel and our soldiers come back hurt", he told a crowd at a Donald Trump party meeting in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin says that her imprisonment "is a problem that people don't want to talk about", and her son and other war veterans, she says, "come back differently, come back boldly, come back wondering if there is respect for what other soldiers and air force, and every member of the military, have given up for their country".
He was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence, domestic violence and drunken gunshots, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 countries, D.C. supporting the challenge of the new asylum policy
18 U.S. states and the District of Columbia are supporting the legal challenge of the U.S. new policy to deny asylum to victims of gangs or domestic violence.
Representatives from 18 U.S. states and a district presented a report on those affected by the policy on Friday in Washington to support an asylum seeker challenging the policy, reports NBC News.
The full name of the plaintiff in the Grace v. Sessions case, directed by the American Civil Liberties Union in a conspiracy against federal policy, has not yet been disclosed.
She said that her partner, "and the sons of her gang members", had abused her, but U.S. government officials denied her asylum application on July 20.
He was arrested in Texas.
Government officials supporting Grace describe El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala, which have the highest number of asylum applications in the U.S., as those countries face endless problems of gangs and domestic violence.
A new asylum policy in the U.S. has changed the 2014 decision of the Board of Immigrant Appeals that allowed undocumented refugees fleeing domestic violence to seek asylum.
Attorney General of the District of Columbia Karl Racine said on Friday that the new policy "is a violation of national, federal [American] and international law".
"The law of the United Nations requires that all asylum applications be examined in accordance with the specifics and conditions of each application, and that prohibition is in conflict with that point", according to a report by the policy-making body.
Furthermore, officials reported that the policy of banning refugees from entering the U.S. could weaken the economy, saying that such people could start businesses or "take on important jobs".
Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered refugee officials to stop providing asylum to victims of domestic violence or violent gangs in June.
"Asylum is available for those who flee their countries because of persecution or fleeing because of race, religion, nationality or membership in a particular social group or political attitude", Sessions set it as of June 11 when announcing the policy.
The asylum was never intended to solve all problems - even the serious problems that people face every day around the world.
Efforts are being made to save lives in Palu while the death toll is increasing to those seeking survivors
The survivors were in trouble.
"We are in a state of tension", said 35-year-old Risa Kusuma, as she raised her son in a rescue center in the troubled city of Palu.
"Every minute an ambulance brings bodies.
Clean water is scarce".
Residents were seen returning to their ruined homes picking up their wet wounds, trying to save whatever they could give.
Hundreds were injured and hospitals damaged by the 7.5 magnitude earthquake were filled with mud.
Some injured, including Dwi Haris, who broke her back and shoulder, were resting outside the Palu Military Hospital, where patients were being treated outside as a result of the impact of the crashes.
He wept as he recited his feelings when a powerful earthquake shook the five-story hotel room in which he, his wife, and his daughter were.
"There was no time to run away.
I was overwhelmed by the walls of the swamp", Haris told the Associated Press, adding that his family had attended the wedding in the city.
"I heard my wife cry for help, but she was silent!
I don't know what happened to her and my child.
I hope they are safe".
US ambassador accuses China of 'terrorism' with 'false advertising'
A week after a major Chinese newspaper published a four-page advertisement about America that insulted the profitable benefits of both the United States and China's trade, an American ambassador accused the Chinese Government of using an American publication to spread lies.
U.S. President Donald Trump last Wednesday spoke in the regular China Daily to Des Moines Register - the state's best-selling newspaper - after accusing China of trying to meddle in the U.S. congressional elections on Nov. 6, a charge China denies.
Trump's alleged interference in the U.S. election against the Chinese government is consistent with what U.S. officials told Reuters is a new step in the U.S. government's accelerated crackdown on China.
While it is common for governments in other countries to promote trade, the Chinese and American governments are competing strongly in trade matters where they increase the import tax rates.
China's retaliatory tax bills were intended to punish states like Iowa that support Trump's Republican Party, say experts in China-American relations.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and longtime governor of Iowa, the chief exporter of agricultural products to China, said the Chinese government had hurt American workers, farmers, and businesses.
Branstad wrote his opinion in the Des Moines Register of Sunday, that China "now breaks the salt with the salt by plainly typing false ads on our free printing press".
"The Chinese government's spread of these lies has taken over the popular American tradition of free speech and free printing by putting paid advertising in the Des Moines Register", wrote Branstad.
"On the other hand", he says, "if you walk down this street in Beijing, you will find few who express feelings of dissatisfaction and you will not see the real attitude of the Chinese people to China's economic downturn, because the media is dominated by the Chinese Communist Party".
He added that one of China's most prominent newspapers agreed to publish his article, though he did not say which.
Republicans Throw Down Women Voters Before Midterm Elections With Kavanaugh's Dispute, Examiners Warn
As prominent Republicans form a coalition to defend the nominee for Congress, Brett Kavanaugh, who faces numerous accusations of abuse, analysts have warned that many women will feel guilty, especially during the midterm elections ahead.
This is a very exciting issue, and most Republicans have shown themselves unwilling to vote.
These are not things to be ignored", Grant Reeher, a political scientist at the Maxwell School at Syracuse University, told The Hill about an article published on Saturday.
Reeher said he did not believe that the effort of Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona) to break into the wet sack of the FBI investigation would be enough to calm angry voters.
"Women will never forget yesterday - they will not forget tomorrow even in November", Karine Jean-Pierre, a senior adviser and spokeswoman for MoveOn, said Friday, according to a Washington, D.C. newspaper.
On Friday morning, activists shouted "Morning is coming!" as they protested in the Senate lobby while the Republican-controlled Judiciary Committee voted to continue appointing Kavanaugh despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, according to Mic.
"Enthusiasm and motivation for democracy will be a big blow", says Stu Rothenberg, a neutral political commentator, in the news.
"People say this is a very important matter; it is true.
It may be even more important, especially among urban women who vote unstable and young voters, 18-29 years old, who, while not fond of the president, often do not vote".
Even before Ford's public testimony detailing the impeachment charges against the nominated Supreme Court justice, the translator says it would be a self-inflicted gunshot if Republicans continued to uphold that.
"This was a confusing outcome for the GOP", said Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, early last week, according to NBC News.
"It's not necessarily the vote of the committee or the final vote or whether Kavanaugh joins the jury, it's the way Republicans treat that woman", Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a Democratic-elect-supporting group, said in the news.
However, Americans seem divided on who to believe when Ford and Kavanaugh's testimony appears, and many support Kavanaugh.
A new survey conducted on YouGov shows that 41 percent of respondents actually pay or perhaps believe Ford's testimony, while 35 percent say they actually or perhaps believe Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent say they think Kavanaugh may or may not have lied in his testimony, while only 30 percent think as Ford does.
Following Flake's strong move, the FBI is now investigating charges brought by Ford along with at least one other prosecutor, Deborah Ramirez, according to a report by The Guardian.
Ford testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee that at the age of 17, Kavanaugh, a drunk, had molested her.
Ramirez laments that a nominated member of the Supreme Court showed him his penis when they went to a party during their Yale studies in the 1980's.
The World Wide Web Designer Plans to Launch a New Internet that Will Compete Significantly With Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, launches a program that will try to compete with Facebook, Amazon, and Google.
This latest project by a technologist, called Inrupt, is a company building on the Berners-Lee Solid platform.
Solid gives users the opportunity to choose where their data is stored and what data is allowed to access.
In a special interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the goal of Inrupt is "world domination".
"Now is the time to act", he said in an organized manner.
"It is a historic moment".
This app uses Solid technology to give people the opportunity to create a "personal online database" or POD.
It may contain contact lenses, to-do lenses, a calendar, a music library, and other personal or professional instruments.
It is similar to Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack, and Spotify and is available when you search the Internet at the same time and all appear at the same time.
The unique thing about personal data storage is that it is entirely up to the user who can access what kind of information.
The company says this is "a powerful tool for communication".
According to the company's CEO, John Bruce, the goal of Inrupt is for the company to develop resources, techniques, and expertise to help make Solid available to everyone.
The company now has Berners-Lee, Bruce, a platform acquired by IBM, other contracted manufacturers, and a team of volunteers who code computer code.
Beginning this week, technology developers around the world can create apps for everyone to use the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said he and his staff are not discussing with "Facebook and Google whether or not to launch a complete change in where all their business models with control have been completely changed.
"We do not ask their permission".
In an article published Saturday in Medium, Berners-Lee wrote that "the intent of [Inrupt] is to generate business activism and collaboration to help protect the integrity and quality of the new website based on Solid".
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet by founding the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been a major influence in the debate over whether Internet service providers should discriminate sheep by horse.
Even when he launches Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain the Founder and Director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation, and the Open Data Institute.
Berners-Lee added: "I look forward to the next time I see what the Web site will look like.
Bernard Vann: The winner of the Victoria Cross in World War I is honored with a ceremony
The only priest of the Church of the Jhatjhe to win the Victoria Cross during World War I as a soldier was honored at a ceremony in his hometown 100 years later.
Lieutenant Colonel Reverend Bernard Vann won the medal on September 29, 1918 at the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
But he was killed by a sniper four days later in hiding but never knew that he had won Britain's highest military decoration.
Two of his boy offenses opened a memorial stone at Rushden's circle in Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
Another of his great-grandchildren, Michael Vann, said that it was "a special commemoration" that the stone was opened exactly in the summer of the 100th since my great-grandfather won the hero award.
According to the London Gazette, on September 29, 1918, Mr. Molef. Vann led a thousand soldiers or battalion across the Canal de Saint-Quentin "without a heavy trench and heavy smoke from the battlefield and from the cannon".
Later he hurried to the battle line and with "remarkable courage pulled them forward to attack with one assault rifle and knocked three down in the army.
Mrs. Molef Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918 - just over a month before the war ended.
Michael Vann, 72, says that my father's actions are "something I never achieve but that makes me feel thin".
He and his brother, Dr. James Vann, also went to plant flowers after the march, led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said that he "feels very honored to have taken part in the march" and added that "the courage of a real warrior is shown by the support that the crowds will provide".
MMA fans sat up all night watching Bellator 206, but instead they were seen with Peppa Pig
Imagine spending the night watching Bellator 206 full and missing the opportunity to see a major event.
In the list from San Jose there were 13 fights, six of which were on a large card and broadcast live all night in the UK on Channel 5.
At 6am, as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to kiss each other's lips, UK residents were left with the man in the mattress when the broadcast was switched to Peppa Pig.
Some were upset that they had stayed up all night until the early hours of the morning just to watch the battle.
One Twitter fan described changing the channel by putting in children's dolls as "a playful act".
"It was a government policy that at 6 a.m. the broadcast was not appropriate, so they were supposed to play a children's program", said Dave Schwartz, Bellator's senior vice president of marketing and communications, when asked about the change in the broadcast.
"Feed the pigs, " I say.
Bellator company president Scott Coker said they will deal with their own arrangements to include UK residents in the future.
"I think when I think about repeating the game, I think maybe there's something that can be done", said Coker.
"But it is six o'clock on Sunday morning and we can't do anything until Sunday in our time, when it is Monday for them.
But we are still dealing with this issue.
The truth is, during the execution, there were many messages that were all hurtful.
We tried to repair the wounds, thinking it was a technical problem.
But it was not, it was a matter of government.
I want to promise you that this will not happen again in the future.
We will organize five wars instead of six - as in the past - we tried to fight for lovers but we exaggerated the story.
We are sorry for what happened".
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley was a sex addict
Tom Daley, an Olympic athlete, has often been compared to others because of his gender - but that has moved him to pursue success.
The 24-year-old says that he did not realize until he attended high school that "not everyone is like me".
In her first talk on Radio 4 Desert Island Discs as Lauren Laverne, she spoke of gay men's rights to give others "hope".
He also said that being a parent has made it so easy for us to win Olympic medals.
The longtime program anchor, Kirsty Young, has been away from work for months because of illness.
Appearing as a rejectionist in Laverne's first program, Daley said she felt "lower than everyone else" when she benefited because "it was not acceptable in society to love boys and girls".
"To this day", she says, "this feeling of inferiority and of being different from others has been a real wound that has given me the strength and determination to succeed".
He wanted to prove that it was "something else", so that not everyone would eventually determine his sexual orientation.
The two-time Olympic bronze medalist is a prominent LGBT rights activist and has used her presence at the Commonwealth Games this summer in Australia to appeal to more countries not to discriminate against homosexuals.
He said he spoke because he felt lucky to be able to live a life of openness without consequences and wanted to give others "hope".
Three times the world's goat has said that dating a man - the US filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 - "has taken a toll on me".
Daley married an Oscar winner, who cared for her for 20 years last summer, but she says age is not a problem.
"When you go through a lot of hardships as a child" - he went to the Olympics for the first time at age 14 and his father died of cancer three years later - he says that it was hard to find someone his age who went through the same hardships.
The couple became parents in June of a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley says that his "look" changed.
"If you had asked me last summer, the main thing was 'I have to win a gold medal,'" he says.
"The truth is, there are wounds more valuable than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie".
His son is named after his father, Robert, who died in 2011 at age 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley says that his father was not happy about his death and that one of the last things he asked for was whether they had tickets to London 2012 - because he wanted to be in line as soon as possible.
"I couldn't say, Dad, you can't be in the front row", she said.
"When he stopped breathing, I held his hand and it was only after he stopped breathing completely and died that I believed that he was fine", she says.
The following summer, Daley competed in the 2012 Olympics and won bronze.
"I knew that this was what I had aspired to all my life - to swim ahead of my team at the Olympics, I felt overjoyed", she put it.
That inspired the first song he chose - Proud by Heather Small - which touched his emotions as he prepared for the Olympics and kept him in a state of shock.
Desert Island Discs is on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 BST.
A retired golfer named Mickelson sits on the beach at Ryder Falls on Saturday
American Phil Mickelson will set a new record on Sunday in his 47th Ryder Cup, but he will have to show that he is also keen to make the experience not bad.
Mickelson, who played in a second-round game to set a record for the 12th time, was seated on the bench by captain Jim Furyk at fourballs and foursomes golf matches on Saturday.
Unlike the United States, where five-time major winners have won, the one who has won five major prizes spends one day as a top contender and the other improving his game in the hope of repairing the badges.
The 48-year-old never hit the ball with drivers and walks with the most balls even in his best form, not strong enough for the Le Golf National, where long balls often beat the balls that fly.
And if the game itself isn't scary enough, in Mickelson's ninth game on Sunday, he faces the unmistakable British Open winner, Francesco Molinari, who is joining newcomer Tommy Fleetwood in the big game, to repeat all of their games this week.
If the Americans, who are four points behind, start 12 games in a hot heat, Mickelson's game could prove to be a real hit.
Furyk showed that he trusted his man, not that he was being rude.
"He fully understands his role today, he hugged me on the shoulder and begged me and told me that he would be ready tomorrow", Furyk says.
"You are very upset.
He is the Most Outstanding Player in the game and has played a major role in these teams in the past, and this week.
I had never seen him play two games.
I expected much, but it was, and we thought it was appropriate.
He wants to be himself, just like everyone else".
Mickelson will surpass Nick Faldo's record in the Ryder Cup games played on Sunday.
It may be his last Ryder Cup game that actually does not match the record he has set.
Mickelson won 18 games, lost 20 and drew seven, but Furyk knew his presence was beneficial to the team.
"He is funny, he is funny, he is a bigot, and he likes to laugh at people, and it's nice to have such a good attitude in the group", she explained.
"I think the youngsters who play with him enjoy his presence, and his week, which is something I enjoy seeing.
His value is more than just a play".
European accountant Thomas Bjorn knows that too much of a focus can disappear in a flash
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knows the accident that occurred to him where he pulled them out of the lead in the final day of the Ryder Cup and in a flash they were not pursued backwards.
This Danishman made his debut in a game in 1997 at Valderrama, a team captained by Seve Ballesteros where a five-point lead against the Americans was complete by a pinch, winning 141⁄2-131⁄2.
"You always remind yourself that we had a great lead at Valderrama; we had a great lead at Brookline, where we lost, and at Valderrama, where we won, but only a little bit of damage remains", says Bjorn, of the pictorial, after the 2018 Team won 5-3 both on Friday and yesterday to lead by 10-6 at Le Golf National.
So history reminds me and all in the group that it is not over yet.
Tomorrow we will be in a bit of a hurry.
We go and do the injuries correctly.
It is not over until you have enough points.
We have a goal, to try to win this cup, and that is what we long for.
I always say, I'm concerned about our 12 players, but we know exactly who the players are - the greatest players in the world".
Enthusiastic about the performance of his players in the intense game of golf, Bjorn added: "I don't want to go on a diet of unripe meat.
We do not know what tomorrow will bring.
Tomorrow, individuals will show up, but that's something else I don't know.
It is a pleasure to work with someone when the wounds are going well, but when you are alone, your skills as a golfer are now fully challenged.
That is a point you should remind athletes to do more tomorrow.
Now you leave your coworker, and you must go and do your best with him".
Unlike Bjorn, the creator, Jim Furyk, will expect his players to improve when playing individually than with assistants, except for Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who scored three out of four points.
Furyk himself saw both sides in the grand final, where he was part of the Brooklyn team before finally being defeated when Europe produced the "Miracle of Medinah".
"I remember everything he said", he said when asked how in 1999 captain Ben Crenshaw, who had awakened the athletes to the last day, had done so.
"We have 12 important games tomorrow, but don't start off as fast as you did in Brookline, and as you did in Medinah.
As the distance continues in the same direction, it presses the games in the center.
We have arranged for them to start tomorrow precisely and set the young men up in a way that we think we can perform a miracle tomorrow".
Thomas is given the responsibility of trying to lead the team to a level playing field and faces Rory McIlroy in the title role, along with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood, and Ian Poulter, other prominent European shoulder-length athletes.
"I chose this team in this order because I think that will cover all the situations", says Bjorn about those he has chosen to play alone.
New German warships re-charged
A new German naval vessel was to be launched in 2014 to replace the warships of the Cold War, but that will not happen until at least next summer because of poor machinery and costly changes, according to German news outlets.
The launch of the "Rheinland-Pfalz", the flagship of the new Baden-Wuerttemberg shipping line, has now been postponed until the first six months of 2019, according to Die Zeit newspaper, citing a military spokesman.
The ship was scheduled to enter service with the Navy in 2014, but problems after its arrival hampered the project.
The Navy ordered four Baden-Wuerttemberg ships back in 2007 and will replace the aging Bremen ships.
It is understood that they will have powerful cannon, numerous missiles to fire on aircraft and ships, and certain technologies to hide the hull, such as a reduced mast, radio and sound signals.
Other important revisions include maintenance times - it will be possible to use new ship models for up to two years away from home ports.
However, the continued delay means that the latest warships - supposedly designed to build a strong German navy - will be outdated when they enter service, according to Die Zeit.
The F125 model was disaster-prone last summer and became a news item when the German Navy refused to use its vessel and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time the Navy had returned a ship to a shipbuilder after it had been delivered.
The reasons for its return are not well known, but German media have mentioned "several software and hardware codes that render the ship useless in battle.
Its software flaws are particularly important, as the Baden-Wuerttemberg ships will have about 120 crew members - half the workforce of the Bremen shipyard.
It also pointed out that the ship was too heavy to jump, which slowed its operation and hampered the Navy's ability to repair in the future.
The 7,000-tonne "Rheinland-Pfalz" is believed to be twice the weight of the similarly designed ships used by the Germans in World War II.
Apart from the structural problems, the cost of the entire ship - including the training of the crew - was also a major issue.
It is said to have frightened people by reaching €3.1 billion ($3.6 billion) - originally to €2.2 billion.
The problems surrounding the new shipbuilding are becoming more important because of the recent warnings that the German navy's strength is declining.
Earlier this summer, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German parliamentary security committee, admitted that the Navy "is running out of skilled warships".
The official said that the matter had taken a long time, since old ships are no longer in use but no new ships were offered.
He lamented that none of the Baden-Wuerttemberg-made ships could enter the Navy.
The National Trust learns about the private lives of the grandmothers
A new study of a group of houses in the Scottish Highlands is intended to reveal how the monkeys use the land to dig for food.
It is hoped that the results of the survey will provide new insights into the behavior of these strange animals as they fly and guide future conservation campaigns.
A study by scientists from the National Trust for Scotland will follow the common soprano pipistrelle monkeys as well as the long-eared brown beetle and the Daubenton monkeys in the four Inverewe Gardens of Wester Ross.
Special recording machines will be installed at key locations on the site to monitor the activity of the cats all season round.
NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct online surveys using handheld scent machines.
The sound recorders of all the recording machines will find out how often the monkeys sing and what kinds of songs they perform.
There a map of their habitat and a record will be produced to provide a complete understanding of the behavior of the snails.
Rob Dewar, a conservation advisor for the NTS, hopes that the decisions will reveal the most important habitat for the ants and how they are used by each species.
This knowledge will help to gain the benefits of the housing management work such as a beginner's approach and a better way to preserve forest opportunities for lizards and other species of animals.
Over the past century the number of locusts has declined dramatically in Scotland and throughout the UK.
They are threatened by buildings and construction projects that affect islands and render them homeless.
Wind turbines and lights can also be dangerous, as can toxic adhesive papers and other chemicals on the roof, and even domestic cats.
In fact, the leopards are not blind.
However, since they hunt at night, their ears work more than their eyes to help them find prey.
They use a sophisticated opportunity tracking technique to spot insects and obstacles along their flight path.
NTS, which is responsible for the maintenance of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens, and 76,000 acres of land nationwide, is taking the reins seriously.
It has trained specialists, who regularly investigate, examine nests, and sometimes rescue insects.
The Society even organized the first single-clawed farmhouse at Threave in Dumfries and Galloway, home to eight of Scotland's ten species.
The farm manager, David Thompson, says that the land is beautiful for the snails.
"Here in Threave we have a great opportunity for the monkeys", he says.
"We have old buildings, many old trees, and good housing opportunities.
But there are many things about the ants that are still unknown, so our task here and elsewhere will be to help us understand more about how they spread".
He stresses the importance of checking the nest before repairing a building, since one may accidentally destroy one nest of black cats and cause the death of 400 females and their young, and possibly all of them.
The leopards are protected and it is a crime to kill them, to abuse them or to interfere with them or to destroy their nest.
Elisabeth Ferrell, a Scottish official with the Bat Conservation Trust, urged the public to perform a man's resurrection.
"There are many things to learn about bats", he said, "and most of our animals don't know how they live".
Ronaldo rejects rumors of rape while the agents plot to attack a German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo has dismissed the allegations of rape against him as "horrible", saying that people "want to make a name for themselves in his name.
His agents were determined to steal the German newspaper Der Spiegel, which published the charges.
The Portuguese and Juventus star was accused of raping an American woman, Kathryn Mayorga, in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2009.
He reportedly paid her $375,000 to investigate the matter, Der Spiegel reported Friday.
When 33-year-old Ronaldo spoke to his 142 million followers on Instagram Live hours after the allegations were reported, he called the reports "storm".
"No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, and no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, and no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, and no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, and no, no, no, no, no, no, and no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, and no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, and no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, and no, no, no
What they said today is a whim", said the five-time Ballon d'Or winner in the camera.
"They want to make a name for themselves in my name.
It is common.
They want to be famous by my name, but that's life.
He's a happy man and the wound is going well", the actor said, grinning.
Ronaldo's agents are preparing to be sued by Der Spiegel for those charges, which they call "an unacceptable report of suspicions in the private sector", according to Reuters.
Agent Christian Schertz said the actor would seek compensation for "the financial damage to moral integrity and the vast amount of human interference, which is perhaps one of the most horrific violations of black rights in recent years".
The alleged incident took place in July 2009 in the rooms of the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga reportedly returned to the player's room, where he allegedly beat him to death, according to papers filed with the Clark City District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga says that Ronaldo fell to his knees after the incident and told him that he was a "99 percent" well-behaved boy and only "one percent" decided.
The documents say that Ronaldo confirmed that he had sex with the girl, but they agreed.
Mayorga also said that she went to the police and was photographed in the hospital, but later made a deal with the court because she felt "scared to take revenge and feared that she would be publicly humiliated".
The 34-year-old woman says that she wants to change the agreement because she continues to be frustrated by the incident she is accusing.
At the time of the alleged bet, Ronaldo was about to start playing for Real Madrid from Manchester United, and this summer he started playing for the Italian giant Juventus for a €100 million contract.
Brexit: UK 'will be re-invented' as carmakers eat the ground
The UK "would be in a recession if it lost its position as a leader in the automotive industry after Brexit, says Business Secretary Greg Clark.
He adds that it was "worrying that Toyota UK told the BBC that if Britain were to leave the EU without a deal, it would temporarily halt production at its factory in Burnaston, near Derby.
"We need a deal", said Mr. Clark.
A Japanese automaker said that Britain's (or Brexit's) unilateral withdrawal would cause people to lose jobs.
The Burnaston plant - which makes Toyota's Auris and Avensis - produced about 150,000 cars last summer, and 90% of them were sold to European Union countries.
"I think if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March we will see production stop at our factory", said Marvin Cooke, Toyota's managing director at Burnaston.
Other UK automakers have also expressed concerns about leaving the EU without agreement on how the trade breakthrough will work, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, says it will spend a month building its Mini plant in Oxford after Brexit.
The main concerns are what carmakers say are the risks of supply if there is no agreement to leave the EU.
Toyota's production was dependent on the demands of the time, and car parts arrived every 37 minutes from UK and EU suppliers for customized cars.
If the UK leaves the EU without a deal on March 29, there could be disruptions at the ports that the industry says could result in delays and a shortage of vehicle parts.
It is not possible for Toyota to hold more than solar stock in its Derbyshire plant, the company said, and so production would be halted.
Mr. Clark said that Prime Minister Theresa May's office's plan for relations with the EU has been "carefully considered to avoid border checks".
"We need to have a deal. We want a wonderful deal that will help us enjoy the richness of this moment and even to seize this opportunity", he shared on BBC's Radio 4's Today.
"The evidence from Toyota and other manufacturers is that we should be able to continue with what has been a series of great successes in supplying goods".
Toyota could not say how long production would be halted, but it warned that increased costs would reduce the competitiveness of the plant and people would lose jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who worked for Burnaston for 24 years and was the organizer of the Unite union on the plant, says that their members are very concerned: "I have learned that once these jobs are over, I never go back.
"We have prepared a sound and reliable plan for future relations with the EU", said a government spokesman.
US parliament says Trump and Rosenstein's meeting may be postponed again
The most important meeting of Donald Trump and deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein may be "scheduled for another week as the war involving the one appointed by the top Congress, Brett Kavanaugh, continues, according to the U.S. Congress on Sunday.
Rosenstein is overseeing the work of special agent Robert Mueller, who investigates Russian election meddling, Trump's relations with Russia and the possibility that the president is interfering with justice.
Whether or not Trump will fire the deputy attorney general, thus jeopardizing Mueller's independence, has stirred up speeches in the U.S. Congress in Washington for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed secretly recording conversations with Trump and the possibility of his being removed from the presidency with a constitutional amendment to change the president.
Rosenstein has disputed this account.
But last Monday you went to the White House, amid reports that you were about to retire.
Instead, it was announced that a meeting would be held with Trump, who was then at the United Nations in New York on Thursday.
Trump said he did not want to expel Rosenstein and the meeting was postponed so that this would not conflict with the Senate Judiciary Committee case in which Kavanaugh and one of his female sexual assault defendants, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, testified.
On Friday, Trump ordered the FBI to spend a week investigating Kavanaugh, delaying the full Senate election.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
When asked about holding a meeting with Rosenstein, he said: "There is no date yet, it may be held this week, or it may be postponed a week due to other events in the high court.
But we shall see, I like to keep the media informed.
Some reporters may dispute this: Sanders has not held a press conference at the White House since September 10.
The communications director, Chris Wallace, asks why.
Sanders said that the lack of regular meetings is not because of the dislike of the TV news, although he said: "But I can't deny that they like to do it in front of an audience".
He then explained that direct communication between Trump and the media would increase.
He said: The president conducts more questions-and-answer sessions than any president before him, and added but without providing evidence: We have examined those figures.
Meetings will always be held, Sanders said, but If the press has the opportunity to question the president of the United States directly, that would be better than talking to me.
We try to do that repeatedly and you have seen it repeatedly in the past few weeks and that is what will happen at a press conference when you speak to the president of the United States.
Trump often answers questions when he is from the White House or when he is holding public talks or when he is in a meeting with visiting dignitaries.
It is not often that one person holds a meeting with the press.
This week in New York, perhaps the president has shown the reason for that, by showing himself to the gathering of journalists occasionally and in a strange way.
A health secretary wrote to EU NHS Scotland staff about the current fear of Brexit.
The Health Secretary wrote to EU staff working for the NHS in Scotland to tell them that the country is grateful and wishes them to continue there even after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman MSP sent a letter although less than six months remain before the UK leaves the EU.
The Scottish government has already made a commitment to pay the costs of applications for EU citizens who are sent to work in government departments seeking to grant rights to local citizens.
In her letter, Ms Freeman said: In the summer months, the UK and the EU have been in talks on the issue of withdrawal, and a decision is expected in the autumn months.
But the UK Government is preparing for the fact that there may be no agreement.
I know that this may be a matter of uncertainty.
That is why I want to emphasize the fact that I deeply appreciate the contribution of every worker, regardless of nationality.
Our colleagues from the EU and elsewhere, contribute in a meaningful way with their experience and skills to strengthen and improve the work of healthcare delivery, and this benefits patients and the community we serve.
Scotland is indeed your home and we want you to remain jealous.
Christion Abercrombie undergoes an emergency surgery on her back for a head injury
Tennessee's Mike Organ reports that back-line player Christion Abercrombie of the Tennessee State Tigers underwent emergency surgery after suffering a head injury on Saturday while playing against the Vanderbilt Commodores, who defeated them 31-27.
Tennessee State head coach Rod Reed told reporters that the accident occurred just before the game.
Reed said: "He went out to the side of the road and fell there.
Practitioners and health workers gave Abercrombie oxygen right there in the middle of the night before taking him to the tractor to examine him.
A Tennessee State official told Chris Harris of WSMV Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had returned from surgery at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris pointed out that the nature and severity of the accident had not yet been determined and that the State of Tennessee was trying to determine when it occurred.
Abercrombie, a second-year undergraduate, is in his first season playing for Tennessee State after leaving Illinois.
He had five tickets that Saturday before leaving the field, bringing his total to 18 tickets this season.
Foreign buyers will be taxed at a higher rate when buying land in the UK
Foreign buyers will be taxed at a higher rate when they buy land in the UK and that money will be used to help homeless people under the new Tory system
This move will undermine Corbyn's success in winning new voters in the spring
Tax revenue will be raised for non-payers of taxes in the UK
The Ministry of Finance expects to invest 120 million pounds (£120 million) a year to help the homeless
Today Theresa May will announce that foreign buyers will be taxed at a higher rate when they buy land in the UK - and that money will be used to help homeless people.
This move will be seen as an attempt to thwart Jeremy Corbyn's success in winning new candidates in the summer by promising to give them affordable housing and high-income tax rates.
The tax bill will be raised for individuals and businesses that do not pay taxes in the UK, and that money will give the Government the power to fight homelessness.
The additional fee - paid in addition to the current tax bill, including the higher rate implemented in the past two years for second and rental housing - may rise to three percent.
The Ministry of Finance expects this move to bring in as much as £120 million a summer.
It is estimated that 13 percent of the houses built in London are bought by non-British residents, which raises prices considerably and makes it harder for new home buyers to get a home.
Many of the country's wealthy - especially those in the city - remain unoccupied, as many foreign customers spend most of their time abroad.
The new policy comes just weeks after Boris Johnson called for lower taxes so that more young people could have their own homes.
He criticized the large construction firms for driving up the price of land, as they buy land but do not use it, and urged Queen May to scrap the low-cost housing policy in order to repair the housing shortages in Britain.
Mr. Corbyn has published a series of compelling proposals for housing improvements, including a rental housing system and a ban on landlord dismissal of tenant without error.
He also wants to give government agencies more power to build new homes.
Mrs. May said: "Last year I said that I would use my power as prime minister to revive the dream of the British people - to improve the lives of future generations.
And that means fixing our housing problem.
Britain will always be open to anyone who wants to live, work and live a jealous life.
But it would be wrong for people outside the UK and foreign companies to buy houses as easily as hardworking Britons.
Many people do not dream of ever having their own homes, and the problem of homelessness is very serious.
Jack Ross: My main ambition is to take over Scotland
Sunderland manager Jack Ross says his "big dream" is to become Scotland manager.
The 42-year-old Scot, who is from Scotland, is pleased with the challenge of restoring the North-East club, which is now third in League One, with three points short of a lead.
He moved to the Stadium of Light in these summer months after helping St Mirren to return to the Scottish Premiership last season.
I wanted to play for my country.
All I found was a B cap, Ross told BBC Scotland's Sportsound.
But as a child I often watched Scotland at Hampden Stadium with my father, and this always made me shy away.
However, that opportunity would only arise if I succeeded in running the club.
The directors who preceded Ross included Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet, and Paulo Di Canio.
The former manager of Alloa Athletic says that he is not afraid to join such celebrity clubs and clubs, for he rejected Barnsley and Ipswich Town's attempts to appeal to him.
Now I will limit my success by can I bring this club back to the Premier League?
It should undoubtedly be in the Premier League according to the organisation and management of this club, he said.
It is not easy to put it in that position, but I will consider myself successful if only I can put it in that position.
Ross has only been in the management role for three years, after spending time as deputy manager at Dumbarton and 15 months training Hearts staff.
He then helped Alloa avoid relegation to the third tier, and in the following season he helped St Mirren avoid being disqualified from the Championship.
Ross says that he now feels more comfortable than when he played for Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren, and Hamilton Academical.
He recalls taking the bones to carry Alloa and says: "Maybe I was at the crossroads.
I firmly believed that a management job was better for me, rather than a game.
It sounds strange because the injuries were good, I earned enough money, and I was successful in achieving certain goals.
But playing is hard.
There are many things you need to do each week.
I still have to face the work pressures and the pressure that comes with it, but I feel the management work is fine.
I have always wanted to be a director, and now that is what I do, I feel more satisfied than ever before in my life.

A study shows that the best time to drink is at 5.30pm on Saturdays
The summer heat has helped Britain's hard-to-drink taverns but has caused problems for restaurants.
Statistics show that taverns saw a 2.7 percent increase in sales in July - but restaurants lost 4.8 percent.
Peter Martin, of the business consultancy CGA, who compiled the figures, says: "The continued sunrise and England's longest World Cup run mean that July was similar to the previous month of June, when sales of tavern products had increased 2.8 percent, while restaurants had plunged even further.
The 1.8 percent loss in the restaurant business in June has been worse in July.
The taverns have performed very well compared to restaurants of similar status.
The food stalls also had a strong crush during this heat, although not as much as the restaurants.
It seems that all the people wanted to do was hang out and drink.
Sales of legal tender products increased by 6.6 percent a month, while food sales fell by three percent.
Paul Newman, a researcher at the RSM on entertainment and hospitality, said: "These figures reflect the situation we have seen since the end of April.
The weather and the impact of major social events or sports are what drive the sale of products into the businesses that people enter.
No wonder the restaurant business is rapidly pulling hard, although a loss of 4.8 percent each summer will be even more painful as prices continue to rise.
The long hot summer has come at a bad time for food vendors and the time will tell if the August moderate heat will improve the situation as desired or how.
Overall taverns and restaurants, including new ones, saw a 2.7 percent increase in July, reflecting a decline in the business.
The Coffer Peach Tracker industry tracks the UK tavern and restaurant business and collects and analyzes data collected from 47 businesses, which have invested over £9 billion, and it is estimated that this is a sign of what is happening in the business.
One in five children has a private social media account that they hide from their parents
A survey shows that one in five children - some as young as 11 - have a private social media account that they hide from their parents and teachers
A survey of 20,000 high school children showed an increase in fake Instagram accounts
The report has raised fears that sexual information is being spread there.
20 percent of students say they have a basic account that they show parents
One in five children - some as young as 11 - open a private social media account that they hide for adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school children showed a dramatic increase in fake Instagram accounts - where photos are shared on Instagram.
The report has raised fears that sexual information is being spread there.
Twenty percent of students say they have a clean basic account that they show parents, but they also have one private one.
And one who had stumbled upon his 13-year-old daughter's secret account discovered that there was a young woman who was pressuring others to rape her.
A survey by Digital Awareness UK and Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference (HMC) in private schools found that 40 percent of 11-18 year olds have two accounts, and half of them say they have a private one.
HMC head Mike Buchanan said: "It is a worrying matter that so many young people are attracted to online accounts where their parents and teachers cannot find them.
Eilidh Doyle will be the "athlete's representative" at the Scottish Athletics board.
Eilidh Doyle has been appointed to the board of Scottish Athletics as non-executive chairman of the governing body at the annual general summer meeting.
Doyle is Scotland's most accomplished athlete in both racing and other sports, and chairman Ian Beattie described the decision as a good opportunity for the sports officials to benefit from his international experience gained over the past decade.
Ellidh is highly respected by all athletes in Scotland, the UK and around the world and we are confident that Scottish athletes will benefit greatly from putting him on the board, said Beattie.
Doyle said: "I am very much looking forward to being an athletic advocate and I hope to contribute and help run the sport in Scotland.
The American, who won the 200- and 400-meter dashes at the 1996 Atlanta Games as one of his four Olympic gold medals, and who now appears regularly on BBC programs, became paralyzed after suffering a stroke.
He tweeted: "Last month I had a stroke.
I could not walk.
The doctors said that it would be obvious in time whether or not I would recover and to what extent.
It was hard, but I recovered, I learned to walk again, and today I am practicing jumping fast!
Thank you for the encouraging messages!
The commercial of a maternal milk pump that compares mothers to cows divides the emotions of the population
A breast milk pump company has created a controversy online about the advertisement that compares breastfeeding mothers to beef cattle.
The tech company Elvie has released a humorous music video to show the freedom this new pump gives to breastfeeding mothers, while promoting what is called the world's best-selling wearable breast milk pump.
The four of them dance a song with the following words from a cow's nest with plenty of hay: Yes, I'm going to the nest, but you don't see the tail and If you don't notice, the cow's milk is not mine.
The chorus said: Pump, pump, I feed the children, pump, pump by the women.
However, the advertisement on Facebook of the company has caused divisions on the Internet.
The video has been viewed 77,000 times and hundreds of people have expressed their opinions, many saying it eases the problems of the dairy industry.
One wrote: "And the decision to use cows to spread this product is foolish.
Like us, they also become pregnant and give birth to milk, the only difference being that they are stolen from calves only a few days after they have had them.
Elvie's breast milk pump is well-suited to the breast-feeding mother's belly (Elvie/Mother)
Someone says: It is understandable that this is a concern for both mother and child.
But what is the problem with advertising breast milk pumps for mothers who are not separated from their babies?
Another adds: This ad is meaningless.
Some advocate the ad, and one woman even says that the song made her feel more attractive.
"I think this is a good idea.
I would have bought it if I hadn't been breastfeeding.
Pumping made me feel like a cow.
The advertisement is crazy in some ways, but I'm stuck with the message.
Another wrote, "This is a good product".
One says: This is a good advertisement for mothers who pump milk (often at work or in the bathroom) and feel like they are cows.
This ad is neither profitable nor critical of the dairy industry.
At the end of the video, the women show that they were dancing with their pumps in their pockets.
This idea is based on the fact that many women who pump milk say they feel like cows.
But the Elvie pump is quiet, has no wires or bottles, and is not visible in the heat, giving women the freedom to move around with their babies, and to reason while pumping milk.
Ana Balarin, assistant ECD at Mother said: "Elvie's pump is such an advanced product that it deserves a special marketing.
By comparing milk-pumping women to milk cows, we want to highlight the issue of milk-pumping and the associated problems, while at the same time showing in a joyful way the wonderful freedom that the new pump brings.
This is not the first time Elvie's pump has been in the news.
At London Fashion Week, a mother of two stood out wearing clothes sewn by Marta Jakubowski while using this product.
Foreign Grandchildren Enter a Tent Camp in the Texas Valley
The number of foreign children in detention has increased despite the fact that the number of people living monthly in the valley has not changed, and the reason for this is that the tough policies implemented by the Trump administration make it difficult to find such children as donors.
Usually, many donors are also illegal immigrants, and they fear the risk of being expelled for helping a child.
The situation worsened in June, when government officials announced that those wishing to make a donation and other members of their families in need of a fingerprint and that the information would be passed on to the immigration department.
Last week, Matthew Albence, chief executive of the Immigration and Taxation Office, told the Commission that the agency had arrested many people who had applied for help for children who were traveling alone.
Later, the organization said that 70 percent of those arrested had no criminal record.
Approximately 80 percent of donors or their families have entered illegally, and most of them are fugitives from crime.
So we've been looking for those people. Mr. Albence said.
To try to speed up the issue of children, authorities have enacted new laws requiring some of them to be brought to court before a month has passed since they were detained, as opposed to 60 days, as was done in the past, according to the refugee camp workers.
Many will quickly take the immigration judge to court, rather than venture to hear their case.
Those deemed unfit will be immediately sent back to their countries.
The long time spent in detention can cause children to become anxious or depressed, which can lead to violence or attempts to flee, according to refugee camp workers and recent reports.
Advocates of the issue say that the problems are even greater in larger areas such as Tornillo, where the signs of a child's difficulty may be overlooked because of the large space.
They add that moving children to tents in cities without enough time to prepare themselves or to greet their friends well makes it even more difficult for many.
Syria tells the US, French and Turkish leaders to leave immediately
Speaking at the UN General Assembly, Minister of International Affairs Walid al-Moualem again urged Syrian refugees to return home, even though the country had been fighting for eight years.
The Mu'alam, who is also deputy prime minister, said foreign forces had illegally entered Syria, saying they were fighting corruption, and that they would deal with it.
He should leave immediately without any conditions, he told the meeting.
The Muslim emphasized that the war against corruption is nearing its end in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011, and millions more are homeless.
He said Damascus will continue to wage this holy war until it clears all Syria's borders has eliminated corruption andthe illegal entry of terrorists.
The United States has about 2,000 Syrian soldiers, who have gone there to train and advise the Kurdish and Arab Syrian forces against President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 soldiers in the war-torn part of the country.
Speaking of the refugee issue, the Mu'alem said that the situation had improved so that they could return, and accused other western countries of spreading unnecessary fear that prevented the refugees from returning home.
"We have called on international and charitable organizations to help them return home", he said.
They turn a desperate problem into a political issue.
The United States and the European Union have said they will not provide aid to rebuild Syria until a political agreement between Assad and the opposition is reached to end the war.
UN representatives say that the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to have a neutral zone in the last major rebel-held Idlib has opened the door to political talks.
The agreement between Russia and Turkey prevented the Russian-led Syrian army from attacking the province of three million inhabitants.
However, the Mo'alem emphasized that the agreement had a specific deadline and said he hoped that the military action would be directed at jihadists, including Al-Qaeda's Nusra Front-affiliated forces, and would be terminated.
UN representative Staffan de Mistura hopes to hold soon the first meeting of a new committee made up of government and opposition representatives to formulate a post-war Syria constitution and pave the way for elections.
The Muslim provided the conditions under which the Syrian government would join the committee, saying that the task of the committee should be to examine the facts of the existing constitution and not to interfere in other matters.
Why Trump Will Win a Re-election
Thus, Mr. Trump will win the 2020 election again, unless perhaps most observers hope that he will be removed from office prematurely because of accusations of dishonesty and corruption.
That will undoubtedly be the most amazing presidential end!
At present there are no signs of the viewers being tired.
Since 2014, the number of viewers on CNN has more than doubled to 1.05 million, and MSNBC has nearly tripled to 1.6 million.
On average, Fox News is watched by 2.4 million people, up from 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen, and MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" has taken the lead with 3.5 million viewers at night on the mainstream.
"There is something that is interesting because there is something that we do not understand", says Neal Baer, director of ABC's "Designated Survivor", referring to the chief government secretary who became president after the attack that destroyed the state legislature.
Nell Scovell, a longtime comedian and author of the book "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys Club", explains the wounds in a different way.
He recalls riding a taxi in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver said he would vote for Mr. Trump.
Why? he asked.
Ms. Scovell says the driver said, "Because you're making me laugh".
There is laughter and confusion.
True, unlike the news on TV, the news in Washington can predict the future of Roe v. Wade, whether immigrants will be reunited with their families or not with the world's economy.
Few capable viewers may choose not to.
And it's not just about being a good citizen when you find yourself spending six hours watching experts argue that Bob Woodward takes notes from his book Fear but hides that he took them there, that Paul Manafort wears a jacket of dog skin (The Washington Post calls it a $15,000 bragging suit) and the consequences of Stormy Daniels calling Mr. Trump a jackass.
I personally will never look at Super Mario the same way again.
Speaking about Trump's ongoing show of people and events (challenging the war with the N.F.L., praising Kim Jong-un), Brent Montgomery, chief executive of Wheelhouse Entertainment and producer of "Pawn Stars", says: "One of the things he does that makes it seem real is that he gives you something every night.
If you miss that program once, you lose.
When I arrived at Mr. Fleiss's home this week, the sun was setting and the heat was 80 feet outside his home on the northern coast of Kauai, but he was sitting in the house watching MSNBC while simultaneously recording CNN.
He could not get up there, as Brett Kavanaugh had to appear before the Senate Judiciary Committee and the future of the Supreme Court had to be decided.
Mr. Fleiss said to me: I remember when we were producing all those amazing programs and people said, That's when the decline of Western civilization began.
I thought they were playing, but now I see that they were telling the truth.

Money flows into the tough middle-market competition
No wonder the 17th district of Pennsylvania spends so much money, because the division of districts has resulted in two candidates from the same party in the same district.
This merger was just made when Pittsburg districts clashed with Conor Lamb, a Democrat Rep. who won another district's election in a special election last summer.
Lamb is running against Democratic Republican candidate Keith Rothfus, who is now representing the old 12th district of Pennsylvania, which has taken over much of the new 17th.
New maps were made after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old districts were illegally divided and to the benefit of Republicans.
The election campaign in the new 17th district has sparked a new campaign of financial competition between the party's top supporters, the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became very popular in Pennsylvania after he won the special election in March, which was watched closely by the 18th District of Pennsylvania.
The seat had been held by a Republican for more than a decade, and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
Political experts have often argued that the Democrats are in a better position.
U.S. Reviews Sanctions on El Salvador or Support China, and It Is Over
Foreign delegates noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama were welcoming Beijing and that Washington was still happy about it.
Mr. Trump held warm talks with President Juan Carlos Varela of Panama in June 2017 and owned a hotel in Panama until his colleagues fired the Trump Organization's management team.
In a message earlier this month, Heather Nauert, a branch spokeswoman, said that officials at the U.S. Department of State's International Affairs Department had decided to recall U.S. representatives from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic, and Panama because of the recent decision to discontinue cooperation with Taiwan.
But they were considering sanctions only on El Salvador, which in 2017 had received an estimated $140 million in U.S. aid, including a ban on drug abuse, and financial aid for infrastructure and the economy.
The sanctions that were promoted, which included a halt to financial aid and a visa ban, would make it more difficult for the Central American country to deal with its high unemployment and homicide rates.
As the departments recovered, officials in North and Central America organized a high-level meeting to discuss security and economic prosperity after a similar meeting last summer was seen as a sign of progress in efforts to stop immigration to the United States.
But in mid-September, the top officials emphasized their desire for a meeting, thus putting an end to the idea of sanctions on El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence is scheduled to speak at the meeting, scheduled for mid-October, and the delegates said that this shows that the administration takes this meeting seriously.
Three American delegates quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama, and the Dominican Republic without carrying threatening or punitive messages from Washington.
Mr. Bolton's White House spokesman declined to give details of the conversation that three American officials, including two foreign diplomats, agreed to discuss the issues discussed as long as they were not named.
Their accounts were confirmed by an outside inspector near the management and he also did not want to be named.
Learn From the History
Another possible cause of the problem is a report by Robert Mueller's special commission that Mr. Trump may have distorted justice, which now has plenty of evidence.
Mr. Mueller is reportedly also focusing his attention on investigating whether Mr. Trump's campaign has cooperated with Russia since our election.
If Congress changes, Mr. Trump will have to answer to that body, just as he prepares to go back to the voters, perhaps even to his classmates.
There are many uncertainties, but I'm not saying how or why Mr. Trump will fall  or see his European counterparts.
There are decisions that all of us on both sides of the Atlantic have to make that will affect how long you stay.
By 1938, German officials were ready to overthrow Hitler, although Western nations opposed him and supported Czechoslovakia, Munich.
We failed, and we missed an opportunity that would have saved us many years of blood transfusions that followed.
The damage that has taken place in history has been dependent on such major changes, and the improvement or decay of democracy is the result.
Americans are having many of these dramatic changes now.
What if Mr. Trump fired Chief Legal Counsel Rod Rosenstein, who was in charge of the outcome of Mr. Mueller's investigations?
Rosenstein got into trouble after the newspaper reported that last summer, he had suggested that the president be recorded in secret and that he thought he was unfit to serve.
Mr. Rosenstein says that The Times' report is false.
What if the FBI's request to investigate Brett Kavanaugh is incomplete or unfair  or if he is admitted to the Supreme Court despite allegations of sexual abuse and evidence of dishonesty?
And above all, will we vote in the midterm elections in Congress that will bind Mr. Trump to responsibility?
If we fail to do this, democracy will be in big trouble.
But I am confident that we will not fail, because of the injuries I have learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who had been deported to Auschwitz by the Nazi regime that had once ruled my embassy.
He survived, moved to America, and 60 years later, he asked me to light Sabbath candles on a table with the Nazi emblem.
Can I imagine a future that will be bleak but that I have such a precious treasure?

Rangers' Graham Dorrans hopes they will win against Rapid Vienna
The Rangers will play Rapid Vienna on Thursday, and know that defeating this Austrian team, after a draw with Villarreal earlier this month in Spain, will put them in a good position to qualify from Group G to the Europa League.
Midfielder Graham Dorrans missed the last season due to a groin problem until they played 2-2 against Villarreal but believes that will motivate Rangers to work harder.
The 31-year-old said: "It was a good point since Villarreal is a strong team.
We went to the game believing we would find something and we had a point.
We may have won the game, but even playing the same game is good news.
They played well in the first half but we were the ones who controlled the game in the second half.
On Thursday, European teams will be playing against each other.
We hope to score three points but that will be a tough game as they won the last game, but with so many supporters I am confident that we will work hard and win.
Last summer, the injuries were severe, I had been injured, and there were changes in the club, but now the injuries are going well.
The team and the athletes are happy; and the training goes well.
I hope we will move forward, forget about the past season and succeed.
Women are not sleeping because of this pension saving plan
Although the participants in the survey knew exactly how much care they needed, few had consulted their families about the matter.
Nearly half of those surveyed by Nationwide say they have discussed the costs of long-term care with their spouses.
Only 10 percent said they had spoken to their children about the subject.
Holly Snyder, vice president of insurance business at Nationwide, said: "People want their families to take care of them, but they don't take steps to discuss it.
We should start by being jealous.
Communicate with your spouse and children: You cannot expect your family to take care of you if you do not tell them ahead of time what you want to happen.
Discuss with your counselor and family how and where you will be cared for, since such decisions will affect the cost.
Include your financial advisor: Your financial advisor may help you find a way to pay for those expenses.
The way you choose to pay for long-term care may include taking out a regular long-term care insurance policy, combining the insurance policy with the money you put into it, or investing your wealth  as long as you have the money.
Fix your legal documents: Fix past legal issues.
Have a document that gives instructions to health care providers and give it to someone you trust who will see that you are being treated and treated in a manner that is in line with your interests, in a situation where you cannot operate.
Also, seek a lawyer to handle your financial matters.
You can choose someone you trust to make decisions about your finances and to ensure that you pay your debts if you are unable to do anything yourself.
Keep in mind a few points: Suppose your elderly parent is in an emergency and is hospitalized.
Can you tell us what medicines you are taking and what is causing them?
Write down those points so that they can be found nearby.
Martin says: It's not just about money, what about doctors?
What is the mean?
Who will take care of the dog?
Organize the items.
Man shot several times Ilfracombe
A man was shot several times as he walked home at night.
The 40-year-old man was in Ilfracombe, Oxford Grove, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, abdomen, and hand.
Officials say the shooting, which occurred at 2:30 BST, was a mere crime.
The victim does not see a shooter.
It is not a serious accident and the police are calling for people to give evidence.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
Officials say at least 384 people died when a powerful earthquake and tsunami struck the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, and that number is expected to increase over time.
Since there is no communication, relief officials cannot determine the situation in Donggala, north of Palu and near the epicenter of the 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
More than 16,000 people were evacuated from Palu after the disaster.
Other highlights about Palu and Donggala, on Sulawesi Island, include:
Palu is the capital of the Central province of Sulawesi, located at the end of a tidal wave on the western coast of Sulawesi Island, and had a population of about 379,800 in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary in the summer when the earthquake and tsunami struck.
Donggala is located on the northwestern coast of Sulawesi island and extends over 300 kilometers (180 miles).
The area, the administrative center of the province, had a population of about 299,200 in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture are the backbone of the economy in Central Sulawesi province, especially in the area near the Donngala coast.
Nickel mining is another important activity in the province, but it is especially prevalent in Morowali, across the Sulawesi coast.
According to the Indonesian Disaster Relief Society, Palu and Donngala have been hit by several tsunamis over the past 100 years.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggala.
A tsunami struck the western part of Donggala again in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia is a region of earthquakes, and earthquakes occur frequently.
Some of the earthquakes and tsunamis that have occurred in recent summers include:
2004: A major earthquake struck the western coast of Indonesia's Aceh province in northern Sumatra on December 26 and caused a tsunami that struck 14 countries, killing 226,000 people in the Indian Ocean coastal areas, more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: Several earthquakes occurred off the western coast of Sumatra between late March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8-magnitude earthquake struck southern Java, Indonesia's most populous island, and caused a tsunami off the southern coast, killing about 700 people.
2009: A magnitude 7.6 earthquake struck near the city of Padang, the capital of the Western Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: A 7.5-magnitude earthquake struck one of the Mentawai Islands, near Sumatra, causing a 10-meter-high tsunami that destroyed several towns and killed about 300 people.
2016: A minor earthquake struck in Pidie Jaya, a region under Aceh, causing devastation and panic among people who remembered the devastation caused by the 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
There was no tsunami this time, but the collapse of buildings killed more than 100 people.
2018: An earthquake struck Lombok, a popular tourist island in Indonesia, killing more than 500 people, mostly in the northern part of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of homes and left thousands of tourists in trouble for a short time.
Sarah Palin's eldest son takes up the charge of causing domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska mayor and vice president Sarah Palin, is arrested on charges of abuse.
Palin, 29, of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of causing domestic violence, interfering with the reporting of the situation, and refusing to be arrested, according to a report released Saturday by Alaska State Troopers.
According to a police report, he confiscated a phone from a woman he knew when she tried to call the police to report crimes.
KTUU reports that Palin is still inmates at Mat-Su Prison and is due to pay a $500 bail.
He reportedly took the case to court on Saturday, where he said that he was not really guilty when asked whether he was guilty or not.
Palin faces three Class A misdemeanor charges, which means she could face a summer sentence in prison and a $250,000 fine.
He is also charged with Class B misconduct, which can result in a day in prison and a $2,000 fine.
This is not the first time Palin has been charged with a crime.
In December 2017, she was charged with assaulting her father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the incident.
The case has been before the Alaska Military Heroes' Association.
In January 2016, he was charged with inciting domestic violence, interfering with the report of the violent incident, and carrying a weapon while drunk.
His daughter reports that he hit him in the face with a stick.
Military heroes criticized Sarah Palin in 2016 after she linked her son's violent behavior to PTSD associated with military service in Iraq.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia: hundreds die
At least 384 people died after an earthquake struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
A magnitude 7.5 earthquake caused a tsunami that destroyed thousands of homes.
Electrical and communication equipment have been damaged and the death toll is expected to rise over time.
An earthquake struck a small area of Sulawesi, a city in the northeast of Indonesia's capital, Jakarta.
People have been posting videos on social media showing this happening.
Hundreds of people had gathered at a beach festival in the city of Palu when a tsunami hit the coast.
State prosecutors make a special request for the NYC suspected of a corruption attack to be sentenced to death
New York state prosecutors demand that Sayfullo Saipov, a suspect in a New York terrorist attack, in which eight people died, be sentenced to death  with the unusual punishment that has been given since 1953.
Saipov, 30, reportedly hired a truck to attack people on the West Side Highway, Lower Manhattan, and burned cyclists and pedestrians in October.
To pass the death penalty, prosecutors will have to prove that Saipov deliberately killed the eight people and injured people, according to a statement filed in the Southern District of New York.
Both charges could result in the death penalty, according to the court document.
Weeks after the attack, the court filed 22 charges against Saipov, including eight for murder in connection with corruption, a charge that often leads to organized crime and a charge of violent and auto-crime.
Describing how Saipov carried out this brutal, vicious, and disgusting act, the lawyers said that the attack required him to sit down and plan and think about it.
The statement of the petition said: "Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov is wounded, grieving the family and friends and even causing the loss of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza, and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco".
Five of the dead were tourists from Argentina.
Ten years had passed since a trial in the Southern District of New York led to the death penalty.
The accused, Khalid Barnes, was found guilty of killing two drug dealers but was eventually sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last time a death sentence was given in New York was in 1953 in the trial of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple who had been executed after being convicted of being Soviet spies during the Cold War two years earlier.
The Rosenberg family was executed in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
The court said that Saipov, a native of Uzbekistan, showed no indifference for days or months after the attack.
One policeman said he told investigators that he was happy.
Saipov told the elders that he was moved to do so after watching ISIS videos on his phone, according to the indictment papers.
The police officer said he also asked to place the ISIS flag in the hospital room where he was.
He pleaded not guilty to 22 charges.
David Patton, one of Saipov's lawyers, says that he was deeply disappointed by the government's decision.
Patton says: I think the decision to appeal the death sentence rather than accept the defendant's guilty plea and life in prison without the possibility of parole only prolongs the time everyone will spend grieving.
Saipov's legal team had asked the government officials not to seek the death penalty.
Tory MP says NIGEL FARAGE should be appointed to lead Brexit talks
Nigel Farage vowed to gather a crowd today at the protest held during the Tory rally.
This former Ukip leader said politicians should feel the heat of the people against the EU's powers just as one of Theresa May's parliamentarians said she should conduct EU negotiations.
Peter Bone, a backbench MP, spoke at a rally in Birmingham saying that the UK would have left long ago had Mr Farage been Brexit Secretary.
But Mrs May's challenge is to unite the opposing sides in her party, which is being aggravated by anti-Brixit supporters holding various protests against Brexit.
The Prime Minister is struggling to maintain his flexible policy with the Chequers because of the attacks by Brexit supporters, anti-Brexit and EU.
His colleagues urge him to continue to negotiate a deal with Brussels despite the opposition - and to force opponents to give the EU and the Labour party the power to choose between his policy and the riots.
Speaking at a protest held in Solihull called Out of Speech Out, Mr Bone said he wanted to disband Chequers.
He said Mr. Farage should also be placed in the same position and given the responsibility of attending the talks on Brussels.
He said that if hoho were the one conducting them, we would have been gone a long time ago.
The Wellingborough MP adds: "I support Brexit but we should dissolve the Chequers.
Speaking of his opposition to the EU, he said: We do not fight world wars to be enslaved.
We want to make our own laws in our country.
Mr Bone denied that public opinion had changed since the 2016 election: The fact that British people have changed their mind and want to become opinioners is not true.
Tory supporter on Brexit, Andrea Jenkyns, was also present at the debate, and told reporters: "All I want to say is: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
The people do not like Chequers, the Opposition does not vote for them, our party members do not like it, and the freedom fighters who made us elected do not like it.
Please leave the Chequers story and listen.
In a message to Mrs May, he added: The Prime Minister will continue as prime minister as long as he fulfills promises.
Mr Farage said to the protesters, politicians should be burned if they do not want to give up on the decisions taken in the 2016 referendum.
He said, "Now the issue is about trust between us  the nation  and our political leaders.
They don't want to talk about Brexit and today we tell them that we won't let them do that.
In a message to the heated crowd, he said: "I want our political leaders, who are about to leave Brexit, to feel the heat.
We are gathering a force of people in this country that has given us the creativity of Brexit and we will not rest until we are an independent, self-governing and proud United Kingdom.
Meanwhile, anti-Brexit protesters marched in Birmingham before holding a two-hour rally in the city's stadium.
Freedom fighters took to the polls against Brexit after the group was formed this weekend.
Labour Party member Lord Adonis has ridiculed the Conservative party for the security problems of the app it uses.
He added: I see people who can create IT programs and all technological things for Canada and that, in turn, they make business collaborations work well across Ireland without borders.
He adds: "That's just a big news story.
The Brexit issue is not good.
Warren prepares to take a closer look at the presidential race
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says she will be hard pressed to consider running for president after the November elections.
The Boston Globe reports that a Democrat from Massachusetts spoke about his future in a city hall in western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, is running for re-election in November against Geoff Diehl of the GOP, who was chairman of Trump's 2016 campaign in Massachusetts.
There are speculations that he may be in a strong race against Trump in 2020.
The meeting held Saturday afternoon in Holyoke was the 36th in the district since Trump took office.
One of the listeners asked him if he would run for president.
Warren replied that now was the time for women to go to Washington to repair our corrupt government, and that included a woman at the top.
Arrest of the suspect who shot and killed Sims of LSU
Police in Baton Rouge, La., announced on Saturday that a suspect was arrested for shooting LSU basketball player Wayde Sims on Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced at an ET news conference that 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson was arrested at 11 a.m.
He released a video of the shooter on Friday, asking for help finding the person.
Sims, 20, was shot and killed near Southern University on Friday morning.
According to 247 sports, police chief Murphy J. Paul told reporters on Saturday: Wayde Sims was shot in the head and died as a result.
Wayde was helping his friend when he was shot.
Simpson was interrogated and admitted to being there, holding a gun and shooting Wayde Sims.
Simpson was unarmed when arrested and is now in the custody of the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
Sims, a 6-foot-1, 1.98-meter native of Baton Rouge, had played in 32 games last season with an average of 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points, and 2.9 rebounds per game.

It became clear from Valtteri Bottas' finish ahead of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday that the Mercedes team's directions would play a major role in this race.
From the very beginning, Bottas set himself up and left Hamilton shocked when he defended his scrum in the first two corners and made Vettel compete against the players in his team.
Vettel moved and left Hamilton trapped in traffic, a decision that must have made a difference.
Mercedes stopped later and came after Vettel, but Hamilton went ahead after the race and the Ferrari driver quietly opened the way for him thinking he would lock him in the third corner.
Max Verstappen started in the back row and finished seventh at the end of the leg, which began on his birthday at the age of 21.
He set himself up for the main part of the race, hoping to finish fast and overtake Kimi Raikkonen to fourth place.
He finally stopped in the 44th round but could not improve on the remaining eight because Raikkonen took fourth place.
It was a difficult day because Valtteri worked hard every weekend and proved to be a real man.
The team did a brilliant job of taking first and second place, said Hamilton.
That Was a Bad Sign
President Donald Trump slammed Senator Dianne Feinstein at a summit held on Saturday for insisting that when she issued a confidential letter to the Supreme Court by Christine Blasey Ford, she accused Brett Kavanaugh of sexual abuse.
At a meeting in West Virginia, the president did not directly mention Ford's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, but said the injuries in the Senate showed that people are crudel, cruel, and dishonest.
The only possible and good thing that happened a few days ago in the Senate, is to see people angry, showing wickedness, cruelty and dishonesty.
When you look at the news, the media says, "Oh, it's not me".
I don't know.
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you produce this document?
Remember his answer... did you issue this document - oh, what?
No, not at all.
I never gave out a paperwork.
Hold on, slowly.
Did we release the document...No, we did not release it adding a deep voice of a member of the Senate.
Feinstein received a letter in July explaining the charges Ford is charging Kavanaugh with, and the letter's details came out in early September  but Feinstein denied that his office issued them.
I did not hide Dr. Ford's accusations, nor did I expose his statements, by that Feinstein to the committee, reports The Hill.
He had asked me to keep the matter a secret and I kept it a secret as he had asked me.
But his explanation seems to have struck the president, who said about the matter at a meeting on Saturday: "You know what, that was a bad sign.
He may not have done that, but that was a sign of a terrible situation.
In defending a Supreme Court nominee, accused by three women of sexual misconduct, the president said the Democrats were using those charges to achieve their goals.
They want to return to government by any means they can use.
He clearly sees that they are wicked and cruel in that they do not care who they hurt or who they trample on as long as they can gain power and power, the Mediaite say these words are those of the president.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee
The Dundee Stars tear themselves apart by losing to the Belfast Giants in the Elite League on Friday by returning the stick to the tree on Saturday as they played at home in Dundee by beating them 5-3.
The Giants were outscored by two points by Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie scored points before Dwyer got the Giants back on their feet.
Francois Bouchard re-measured Dundee's points before Lukas Lundvald Nielsen scored the two points that gave them the victory.
It was Adam Keefe's third defeat in the Elite League, which on Friday, when playing Belfast, beat Dundee 2-1, though they had been knocked out first.
It was the fourth time in the season that the two teams had faced each other, and the Giants had won three more games played before him.
Dwyer made the starting point in the fourth minute at 3:35 with Kendall McFaull in hand, and David Rutherford made Beauvillier the starting point with him four minutes later.
The game started off in a good way, and Sullivan scored the score at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt handed Cownie the score at 15:16.
Dwyer made sure the Giants were ahead in the first half of the game when he scored the second point late during the night's break.
Dundee re-arranged and Bouchard scored in a power play at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran teamed up to help Nielsen put Dundee first late in the game and ensure his team stayed ahead until the tide began to rise.
The Giants, who have lost four of their last five games, will play home against Milton Keynes on Friday.
An Air Traffic Controller Dies to Rescue the Elders from the Earthquake
An Indonesian air traffic controller was posthumously awarded the title of hero to ensure that the plane that carried hundreds of people took off safely.
More than 800 people have died and many others have gone missing after a major earthquake on the island of Sulawesi on Friday caused a tsunami.
There was another earthquake after that, and many people were trapped in the outskirts of Palu.
Although his colleagues fled to save their lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his desk in the shaky tower of the Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport in Palu.
He stayed there to ensure that the Batik Air Flight 6321, which was about to take off, left safely.
Then he jumped from the traffic control tower when he thought it was going to fall.
He later died in hospital.
Australian ABC News reports that the head of the Indonesian Air Service, Yohannes Sirait, says that the decision may have saved hundreds of lives.
We called a helicopter from Balikpapan, Kalimantan, to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
But unfortunately, he died this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
He adds, "Our hearts are aching because of this".
Meanwhile, authorities fear that the death toll may reach thousands as the national relief agency says it is difficult to reach the cities of Donggala, Sigi, and Boutong.
The party's leader, Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, says: "We believe that number is increasing as many bodies are still under the rubble and we cannot yet get them out.
A six-meter-high wave destroyed Palu, which will hold a mass funeral on Sunday.
Commercial and military aircraft bring relief.
Risa Kusama, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "An ambulance is always bringing bodies.
Clean water is scarce.
Small shops are being stolen everywhere.
Jan Gelfand, the head of the International Red Cross, told CNN: The Red Cross in Indonesia is running to help the survivors but we don't know what we will find when we arrive.
The situation is already bad, but it can get worse.
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the country's military: I urge you to work day and night to do everything necessary to evacuate the people from this area.
Are you ready to fall into the trap?  CNN reports.
Earlier this summer, an earthquake struck Lombok, Indonesia, killing more than 550 people.
Aircraft Crash in Micronesia: Now Air Niugini says one person is missing after the plane crashed into the water
The pilots of the plane that crashed into the waters of the Pacific Ocean, Micronesia, now say one person is missing, after earlier claiming that all 47 passengers and crew were safely evacuated from the sinking aircraft.
In a statement released by Air Niugini on Saturday afternoon, it said it did not know where another male passenger was.
The pilots said they were working with authorities, hospitals, and investigators to find the man.
The pilots were discreet in providing information about the passenger, such as his age or race.
Local boats helped to rescue passengers and crew when the plane crashed into the water while trying to land at the airport on Chuuk Island.
Officials said on Friday that seven people had been taken to the hospital.
The pilots said that six passengers were still in the hospital on Saturday, and all are in stable condition.
It is not known what caused the plane crash or what happened before.
U.S. air traffic controllers and the U.S. Navy say the plane is in the water near the airport.
Some witnesses think that the plane passed the airport by mistake.
Bill Jaynes, an American pilot, said that the plane had fallen to the ground.
Jaynes says: "That was a really good story.
Jaynes says that he and others were able to walk through the water to the knees through the lifeboats of a deep airplane.
He says that the flight attendants were frightened and shouted that he had suffered a few head injuries.
The U.S. Navy says that sailors who were working nearby to refine the harbor also helped by using a pumped boat to take people to shore before the plane sank to a depth of about 30 meters.
Data provided by the Aviation Safety Network shows that 111 people have died in aviation accidents over the past two decades in PNG, but those accidents have nothing to do with Air Niugini.
A researcher says a woman was burned alive at night
The court on Saturday rested on the case of a man accused of burning a woman alive in Mississippi in 2014.
U.S. Justice Department investigator Paul Rowlett spent hours testifying as an expert in criminal investigations.
He showed the court how he used cell phone records to track the movements of the 29-year-old Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old Jessica Chambers on the night of his execution.
The Clarion Ledger reports that Rowlett said she had found several cell phone records showing the occasions Tellis went with Chambers the night he was killed, refuteing what she had said earlier.
When evidence showed that Chambers's cell phone was with him at the time he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police contacted Sanford.
Sanford witnessed on Saturday and said that he was not present that day.
When lawyers asked if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in a Sanford truck that night, Sanford said he wasn't, because my truck was in Nashville.
Another point Tellis made was that he claimed to have known Chambers for about two weeks before his death.
Phone records show that you only knew him for a week
Rowlett says that shortly after Chambers' death, Tellis deleted Chambers' messages, phones, and identity on his phone.
Hale says: "She wiped him out of her life".
His advocates are expected to be fired on Sunday.
The judge said he expects the case to be heard later that day.
The High Breed: What does hip hop teach about social problems?
Three hip hop musicians are joining forces to change the bad name of the music by creating songs with helpful messages.
The High Breed, a band from Bristol, says hip hop has moved away from its original message of political issues and social solutions.
It wants to go back to the roots of this music and to make hip hop that teaches about social problems popular again.
Bands such as Fugees and Common are also popular in the UK thanks to musicians such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black man?!
A New York nanny charges a couple after they texted a message that was discriminatory
A New York nanny charges a couple with dismissing her for prejudice after she mistakenly received a message from him and complains that he is a black person.
The couple dispute the claim of prejudice, comparing the accusation to a bribery.
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, expressed her frustration with Giselle Maurice, who would take care of her children in 2016, and realized that she was black.
Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman wrote her husband a message, "This is NOT THE ONE".
But instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Ms. Maurice, twice.
After realizing that she had thrown it away, Plasco-Flaxman, who was still free, fired Ms. Maurice on the grounds that the child's caregiver had mocked them and was a black person, now looking for a Filipino, according to the New York Post.
Ms. Maurice was given a day's rest and was taken home by Uber.
Maurice now accuses the couple of firing him and asks for $350 a day for the six months he was originally hired to work and live there, although they had not signed a contract.
He told the Friday Post, "I want to show them that they shouldn't do such a thing" and added that "I don't know it's discrimination".
The couple rejected accusations of prejudice, saying that the expulsion of Maurice was reasonable, since they did not trust him to hurt him.
My wife sent him that message by mistake.
He is not a person of prejudice.
We are not racist, her husband Joel Plasco told the Post.
Would you leave your children with the person you have hurt, even if it was accidental?
What is your newborn baby?
Let us speak the truth.
Plasco compared the charge to regularity, and said that his wife had only had a child two months ago and was in a very difficult situation.
Will you now fight against such a man?
This is not the right thing to do, adds the banker.
Although the case is still pending in court, many people criticize the couple on social media, disliking their behavior and thinking.
The new text reveals that Paddington's publishers fear that readers will not understand the bear's speech.
Bond's daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was received, said of the letter: "It is difficult to get into the diet of someone who will have read it before the book is published.
That is surprising, for we now know how successful Paddington is.
He says that his father, who took videos from the BBC before being moved to write a children's book featuring a small teddy bear, would have had confidence in his work when it was criticized, adding that the 60th anniversary of the book's publication was a "good and sad news" after his father died last summer.
Referring to Paddington, whom he describes as "a very important person in our family", he adds that his father was proud of his achievements.
He says, HE was a quiet person and did not like to speak for himself.
But since Paddington was real to her, it was as if she had a child who had achieved something: enjoying his success even though you had not worked hard.
I think that's how he felt about Paddington's success.
Although it was his writing and invention, he always paid homage to Paddington himself.
My daughter was dying, and I had to speak to her on the phone about the separation.
Upon arrival, she found her daughter rushed to the Nice Hospital Louis Pasteur 2, where doctors were working hard to save her life.
Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse says: "Nad kept calling me, telling me that it was bad and the doctors didn't think the girl would live.
Then I got a call from Nad telling me that you're a girl who's going to die in two minutes and I had to tell her the words of separation.
I did that once.
I said, Tashi, I love you very much, dear.
I will be with you soon.
I will be with you.
The medications that doctors had given her to help her heart beat were gradually leaking out of her body.
He had not died, but it was coming from the body.
I had to sit there and wait, knowing that the decision was over.
I could not cry or cry because I was surrounded by family and friends.
I had to control myself.
Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, who was grieving the loss of her daughter, eventually boarded the plane with other passengers who did not know what was happening to her.
He says: "No one knew.
I bowed my head, and my tears just spilled.
It's hard to explain, but it was on the plane that I felt Nad's pity for the way I was being hurt and explained.
That he lacked my love and understanding.
I know how much he loved the girl.
Two bereaved women put up cards to prevent people from committing suicide on a bridge
Two women who lost loved ones to suicide try to prevent others from committing suicide.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have long placed encouraging cards on the Welsh bridge and telephone numbers for people to call when they need help.
Ms Davis' son, Tyler, was 13 years old when he began to suffer from depression and committed suicide at age 18.
She says: "I don't want any parent to feel the way I feel every day.
Mrs. Davis, 45, who lives in Lydney, says that her son was a good cook and had a winning smile.
Everyone knew him for his smile.
They always said that her smile lit up the house.
But he quit his job shortly before committing suicide, having been severely disabled.
In 2014, after Tyler committed suicide, his then 11-year-old brother found him.
Ms Davis says: "I'm always worried that this will be a risk to her too.
Ms. Davis made cards, telling people that there are people to see or talk to, even if she is a friend.
Don't get too caught up in the matter  you should talk.
Ms. Humpherys, who was a longtime friend of Ms. Davis, lost her husband, Mark, to whom she was married for 15 years, shortly after Mark's mother died.
He says: "She didn't talk about her depression or depression.
A few days before Christmas we realized that he was no longer as we know him.
She was very upset about Christmas. When the children opened their presents, she could not look them in the eye or do anything.
She says that her death has hurt them deeply, but they have to deal with the situation: It has caused a big gap in the family.
It has broken our spirit.
But all of us must struggle and move on.

Brett Kavanaugh's future is uncertain as the FBI begins its investigation
I thought that if we could find something that would lead to the one who requested  limited-time and limited-time surveys  we might be able to bring some consensus, Mr Flake said on Saturday, adding that he feared the committee would be disjointed by the political parties' contention.
Why do Mr. Kavanaugh and Republican supporters not want the FBI to investigate?
They are uncomfortable over time.
There are only five weeks left until the midterm elections, on November 6  and if, as Republicans expect, he does not succeed, that will dampen their efforts to elect the candidate to the country's highest court.
George W. Bush has been calling the Senate, recruiting them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who served Mr. Bush in the White House and met his wife Ashley there, who was Mr. Bush's secretary.
What will happen if the FBI does not report?
Elections will be held in the Senate, where there are now 51 seats for Republicans and 49 for Democrats.
It remains unclear whether Mr. Kavanaugh will be able to get at least 50 votes from the Senate, which will make it easier for Vice President Mike Pence to resolve the issue and appoint him to the Supreme Court.
The number of North Koreans going to work decreases under Kim's rule
A South Korean lawmaker says that the number of North Koreans living in South Korea has declined since Kim Jong-un took power seven years ago.
Park Byeong-seug, quoting data from a branch office in South Korea, said that 1,127 were killed last year compared with 2,706 in 2011.
Mr. Park says that one of the reasons for this is the strict rules on the border between North Korea and China and the high demands of the mourners.
Pyongyang did not give a speech.
Most North Koreans living in South Korea are eventually granted South Korean citizenship.
Seoul says that more than 30,000 North Koreans have lived in South Korea illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Many flee through China, which forms a long, narrow border with North Korea and is easier to access than the hard-hitting border between the two countries.
China considers the North Korean refugees to be illegal immigrants rather than refugees, so it forces them to return home.
North and South Korea have been fighting each other, though the situation has improved in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang to hold talks on the delayed reduction of nuclear weapons.
This came after President Donald Trump held a special meeting in June with Kim Jong-un in Singapore, where they agreed to work together to make Korea's nuclear-weapon-free nation.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho said that U.S. sanctions were the main reason for the delay.
In a speech to the UN General Assembly, New York, Mr. Ri said: "If we do not trust the US, we cannot be convinced that our country is safe and in such a situation, we cannot remain without weapons.
Nancy Pelosi says Brett Kavanaugh is "feeling emotional", and does not qualify for the Supreme Court
House Minority leader Nancy Pelosi says that the candidate for the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh is "feeling emotional", and is not fit to serve in the Supreme Court.
Pelosi said that on Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
Speaking of Kavanaugh's testimony Thursday before the Senate Judiciary Committee, Pelosi said: "I believe that if it had been a woman who had done so, it would have been a matter of emotion.
Kavanaugh raised his emotions when he denied that he sexually abused Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were teenagers.
Kavanaugh's feelings rose when he discussed his case and at times he even sounded like a quarrel and lost his temper when he talked about his family while in high school.
He also quickly denounced the Democrats before the committee, saying that the charges against him were only "a smear campaign" by people whose hearts were broken because Hilary Clinton was defeated in the presidential election.
Pelosi said she thought Kavanaugh's testimony showed that he would not serve on the Supreme Court, because he had shown prejudice against the Democrats.
He said, "I think he's the one who got away with saying those words and the way he mocked Clinton and the Democrats".
Pelosi nodded when asked if she would try to remove Kavanaugh from office if found guilty and if the Democrats would win the House of Representatives.
Pelosi said: I would say  if he's been cheating on Congress or the FBI, he's not fit to be on the Supreme Court, not even you, where he's on now.
Kavanaugh is now a judge in the D.C. Court of Appeals.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat he was concerned that Kavanaugh might decide against the Affordable Care Act or Roe v. Wade, as he was perceived to be an anti-corruption judge.
At a meeting held before his appointment, Kavanaugh was questioned as to whether he would change some of the decisions of the Supreme Court.
"This is not the time to take a person with a nervous breakdown to court and expect us to say, 'This is really good news.'
Women Need to Exhibit It.
It is righteous anger, months and years of anger, and he cannot speak without weeping.
Mrs. Steinem told me 45 years later: "We cry when we're angry.
I guess that's what most of us do, right?
She added, I was greatly helped by a woman who was an officer at one point, who said that she too cried when she was angry, but that she had devised a plan to keep her from being angry and started crying, telling someone she was talking to, You might think I was hurt because I was crying.
I am angry.
Then he continued to speak.
I thought that was a wonderful story.
It is normal to cry out in anger because people do not understand the matter well.
One of the first things I remember when I started working in a crowded office was when I found myself crying in a rage, when an elderly man who was a hard-nosed manager I was afraid of, slammed my neck to the corner of the stairs.
He said to me: 'Do not let them see you crying.
They do not know that he is angry.
They think you are hurt and will be glad to have it.
Patricia Schroeder, then a Democratic Congresswoman from Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart on his campaign for president.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was found with a limp on board the Monkey Business and decided to quit, Ms. Schroede was very upset, but decided that there was no reason for her not to run for president.
He told me 30 years later, "That was not a wise decision.
Seven other candidates had already been nominated, and they did not need to be added.
Someone else said that Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.
Since the campaign had recently begun and he was lagging behind in raising funds, he vowed not to run until he had raised $2 million.
It was worse.
He noticed that some of his supporters, who gave $1,000 to the men, gave him only $250.
I wondered, Do they think I get a discount?
When he gave his speech announcing that he would not campaign, he was so moved that he shook his voice  when he thanked those who supported him, expressing his frustration with the system that makes it difficult to raise money and that makes it harder for voters to get elected, and about discrimination against women.
Commenting on the way the media treated her, Ms. Schroeder says: "You would think I was crazy.
You would think Kleenex was my financial backer.
I remember thinking in my heart, 'What will they write on my tombstone?'
Did you cry?
How the US-China Trade Dispute may benefit Beijing
Experts say the sound of trade war between the U.S. and China is a deafening one, and since the war will not end now, the distance between the two countries may in time benefit Beijing.
US President Donald Trump issued the first warning earlier this summer when he taxed China's mainstream products including solar panels, steel, and aluminum.
The tax bill is high this week when new tariffs on $200 billion worth of goods were introduced, in fact paying half of all U.S. imports from China.
Beijing has also recently raised taxes on U.S. property worth $60 billion by five to ten percent.
China has vowed to compete with the US and the world's second-richest country will not back down.
For Washington to retreat from this war would mean that it accepts China's terms, but for China to submit to the US even then would be a disappointing blow to Chinese president, Xi Jinping.
However, experts say that if Beijing plays its cards well, the pressure of the US trade war could benefit China by dividing the two countries so that they do not rely on each other economically.
Abigail Grace, a researcher on Asia at the New American Security Institute, says: "The urgency of decisions whether by Washington or Beijing may cause those countries more serious economic problems than observers think.
Foreign Minister says Syria is not ready to welcome returning refugees
Syria says it is ready to accept refugees who choose to return and is seeking aid to rebuild the war-torn country of more than seven years.
Speaking at the United Nations General Assembly, Minister of International Affairs Walid al-Moualem said that the situation in the country was improving.
He says: Now the situation is more stable and safe, thanks to progress made in the fight against corruption.
The government continues to restore opportunities that have been destroyed by the crooks to make life normal again.
Now the conditions are right for the refugees to volunteer to return to their homelands where they had fled corruption and financial hardship that made it difficult for them to support their families.
The UN estimates that some 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
Six million more people still in need of relief in that country.
Al-Moualem says that the Syrian government will appreciate the help to rebuild the devastated country.
But he emphasized that they would not accept conditional or foreign aid that encouraged rebellion.
Europe takes the Ryder Cup, Paris
The European team won the 2018 Ryder Cup by beating Team USA by 16.5 points while the USA by 10.5 points, while playing Le Golf National outside Paris, France.
The U.S. has now been defeated on European soil six times in a row and won the Ryder Cup in Europe for the last time in 1993.
Europe was ahead when the Danish captain, Thomas Bjorn, scored 14.5 points needed to beat the United States.
Phil Mickelson, a US champion, finished the game with a hard shot after throwing his first ball into the water in par-3 on the 16th hole, thus losing to Francesco Molinari.
The Italian lineman excelled in the game, becoming one of four players to ever reach a 5-0-0 mark since the game was first played in this way in 1979.
Jordan Spieth of the United States was eliminated in 5&4 by the lowest-ranked player of the European Team, Thorbjorn Olesen of Denmark.
The world's best athlete, Dustin Johnson, was eliminated 2-1 by Ian Poulter of England, who may have played his last Ryder Cup.
Sergio Garcia of Spain, the eight-time winner of the Ryder Cup, has been the most successful European athlete with 25.5 points.
I often cry, but today I cannot help myself.
And it was a hard summer.
I thank Thomas for lifting me up and showing his trust in me.
I am so happy to have won this trophy again.
I am a winning team, and I am proud to have been able to contribute to that creation", says Garcia, who is moved by the creation of Europe.
He passes the puck to his teammate John Ram who won Tiger Woods, the US golf championship, 2&1 on Sunday in a one-man match.
Rahm, 23, said: "I feel very proud to have won Tiger Woods, I enjoy watching his games.
Woods has lost all four of his games in France and now has a record of 13-21-3 in Ryder Cup matches.
It is an amazing record for one of the greatest athletes, having won 14 major trophies and second only to Jack Nicklaus.
The USA team has been pulling hard this week except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas, and Tony Finau, who have played a great golf game at those games.
U.S. team captain Jim Furyk spoke of his team's disappointing game, saying, "I'm proud of these guys, they fought.
This morning we surprised the European team.
We tried.
We are taking Thomas to the bathroom.
He is a good captain.
All 12 of his players played very well.
We will re-elect, I will work with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup Committee and we will continue.
I love my 12 brothers and am proud to work with them.
We must continue to respect them.
The game has won us over.
Recent Information on Red Tide Pollution Decreased in Pinellas, Manatee, and Sarasota
A recent report from the Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission shows that overall the number of Seawater Pollution has decreased in areas near Tampa Bay.
According to FWC, it is reported that Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte, and Collier are not seeing any seabirds  suggesting that pollution is declining.
The Sea Water Pollution Range is estimated to be about 130 miles [130 km] long, stretching along the coast from northern Pinellas to southern Lee.
Places with badges were found about 10 miles off the coast of Hillsborough County and a few other locations last week.
Seawater pollution has also been detected in Pasco County.
Last week, a mid-level pollution was reported near the coast of Pinellas County, a low to high level near Hillsborough County, a low to high level near Manatee County, a low to high level near the coast of Sarasota County, a low to high level near the coast of Charlotte County, a low to high level near the coast of Lee County, and a low pollution level in Collier County.
Respiratory problems continue to be reported in Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Lee, and Collier.
No respiratory problems were reported in Northwest Florida last week.
