Rapidly growing coronavirus (COVID-19) in the EU/European Economic Area and the UK, from 1 January to 15 March 2020
The emergence of a similar trend in the EU/EEA member states and the UK shows that although the outbreak in different countries varies in different stages, the COVID-19 pandemic is spreading rapidly in all countries.
Based on the experience gained from the disease in Italy, countries, hospitals and special care wards should increase their preparedness for the large wave of COVID-19 patients who will need medical treatment, especially special care.
On December 31, 2020, a cluster of pneumonia patients with an unknown cause was reported in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
On January 9, 2020, the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention reported that the cause of the disease, which is a new form of coronavirus, is henceforth referred to as the acute respiratory syndrome of severe coronavirus 2 or SARS-CoV-2 for short.
Since then, the unpleasantness caused by infection with SARS-CoV-2 has been called coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
Current records indicate that about 80% of people infected with COVID-19 have mild respiratory infections with or without pneumonia, and most of these patients recover.
About 14% of cases, COVID-19 became more severe, with patients being hospitalized, while the remaining 6% were admitted to special care with very severe illnesses.
The mortality rate of hospitalized patients due to COVID-19 is about 4%.
In this study, we assessed trends in the prevalence of COVID-19 in each of the EU/EEA countries and the UK and compared them with trends in Hubei Province, China.
We also compare the current number of COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and the UK with those in Italy between 31 January and 15 March 2020.
COVID-19 infections in EU member states/European Economic Area and the UK
Subsequently, COVID-19 spread to more geographic areas in China and the dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic in other parts of the world are already following the same trend in the country.
On March 11, the Secretary General of the World Health Organization (WHO) announced the COVID-19 pandemic.
In the March 5, 2020 issue of Eurosurveillance, Spiteri and colleagues reported the first European case of the coronavirus as defined by the World Health Organization.
In the EU/EEA, the first confirmed cases were reported by France on 24 January 2020 among travellers returning from Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
As of 15 March 2020, COVID-19 cases have been identified in all 30 EU/EEA countries and the UK (UK), with 39,768 cases reported and 1,727 cases reported between 31 December 2019 and the end of the previous date, with Italy alone having 1,7750 cases and 1,441 deaths.
Collecting and reporting COVID-19 cases
At the European Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (ECDC), the statistics of confirmed COVID-19 cases in every country in the world are received daily from official sources such as the Ministry of Health, national and regional health authorities in these countries and the World Health Organization and are updated at 8:00 a.m.
These data were used to assess COVID-19 trends in EU/EEA countries and the UK and compare them to Italy.
As a basis for determining the prevalence of COVID-19 active fractures, we calculated a 14-day shortened cumulation time for COVID-19 patients, so the normal COVID-19 time period was taken into account in each EU/EEA member state and the UK, from 1 January to 15 March 2020.
The total number of patients per country was also compared with the total number of patients for the period from 31 January to 15 March 2020 as of 08:00 am on 15 March 2020.
COVID-19 incidence in EU/EEA countries and the UK
Trends observed in the shortened 14-day cumulation of COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and the UK generally corresponded to the above trends in Hubei Province (China) (Figure 1).
In total, in the EU/EEA member states and the UK, COVID-19 outbreaks began around 21 February and then accelerated rapidly around 28 February 2020 (content attached).
This was mainly due to the rapid increase in reported cases from Italy, but all other EU/EEA member states and the UK also showed similar growth trends in COVID-19 incidence (claimed).
Figure 2 compares the cumulative number of COVID-19 infected populations in the EU/EEA countries and the UK with those infected in Italy between 31 January and 15 March 2020.
It explains that as of 8:00 a.m. on March 15, 15 other EU/EEA member states and the United Kingdom reported total cases, comparable to those of Italy in the previous three weeks or less.
Our results indicate that the number of definitive cases of COVID-19 is increasing rapidly in EU/EEA member states and the UK.
Trends observed in the buildup of COVID-19 suggest that the pandemic is spreading at a similar rate in all countries.
This is despite the fact that countries experience different stages of the outbreak, there are differences in the responses of public health authorities in different countries and different criteria apply to people who need to undergo a validation test or a complementary COVID-19 test.
In early March 2020, doctors in infected areas of Italy reported a situation in which about 10% of COVID-19 patients needed special care, and media sources reported that the maximum capacity of hospitals and special care wards in these areas had already been completed.
Currently, only 6% and 1% of EU Member States/EEA countries have data on hospitalization and/or admission to special care for COVID-19 patients (data is not shown).
However, they must be systematically compiled to complement current surveillance data and focus on a number of reported and death-related fractions.
A survey conducted in the period 11-2010 showed a large difference in access to special and medium care hospitals in Europe, ranging from 29.2 beds in Germany to 4.2 beds in Portugal per 100,000 inhabitants.
This means that these countries have more or less resources than Italy (average of 12.5 special care facilities per 100,000 inhabitants in 11-2010).
Modelling scenarios related to the saturation of health and treatment capacity were presented with estimates for each EU/EEA member state and the UK for the number of COVID-19 patients admitted with a risk >90% exceeding the capacity of special care facilities in the sixth ECDC Rapid Risk Assessment on COVID-19.
Since the number of cases of acute facial reflux has been collectively observed in certain regions in the EU/EEA member states and the UK and hospitals and special care facilities usually provide services to a regional population, information on the number of cases of acute facial reflux and special care facilities should be provided preferably in accordance with the territorial units for statistical level 2 (NUTS-2) procedure.
The experience of the disease in Italy and current trends in other countries indicate that the COVID-19 pandemic is spreading rapidly in the EU/EEA member states and the UK.
Therefore, countries, hospitals and special care wards must prepare themselves to deal with the scenario of continuous mass transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and make arrangements to admit COVID-19 patients, especially in special care, just as in infected areas of Italy.
As stated in the recent ECDC Rapid Risk Assessment, a rapid, forward-looking and all-inclusive approach to delaying the spread of SARS-CoV-2 is essential, as the expected rapid increase in the number of cases may not provide adequate opportunity for decision-making institutions and hospitals to identify, accept and implement appropriate responses if the necessary measures are not taken in advance.
Rapid risk assessment also lists public health measures to mitigate the effects of the pandemic.
Countries have a short-term opportunity to strengthen their control efforts and slow the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and thus reduce the pressure on the healthcare system.
If this is not possible, healthcare systems in other EU/EEA countries are likely to face a large wave of patients requiring special care in the coming days or weeks.
The 2019 outbreak of coronavirus disease (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2), has resulted in over 3,000 deaths and more than 80,000 illnesses in China and other parts of the world to date, and has led to a human catastrophe.
SARS-CoV-2 may also have been transmitted by bats, similar to its homologue, SARS-CoV, which caused SARS in thousands of people in 2003, and may have caused similar symptoms by a similar mechanism.
However, COVID-19 is less severe and lethal than SARS, but has a higher prevalence and infects older people and men more than young people and women.
In response to the growing number of publications on the emerging disease, the Counter-Strike has sought to provide timely and comprehensive research coverage of the issue.
We will provide basic information on epidemiology, etiology, virology, diagnosis, treatment, prevention and prevention of disease.
Although many questions remain unanswered, the study is expected to be a useful tool in identifying and eradicating this dangerous disease.
The Spring Festival on January 25, 2020 became an unprecedented and unforgettable memory for all Chinese who were asked to stay home for the entire holiday and many weeks afterwards due to the outbreak of a new viral disease.
The virus has a high homology to the coronavirus (CoV) that caused the 2003 outbreak of the acute respiratory syndrome (SARS); therefore, on 11 February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) chose the name SARS-CoV-2 and the name of the disease associated with it, CoV Disease-19 (COVID-19) (Coronavirus-19 disease or COVID-19).
The epidemic began in Wuhan, China, and quickly spread across the country and to about five other countries around the world.
As of March 2, 2020, the virus has resulted in a definitive infection of more than 80,000 cases, with the number of patients discharged exceeding 40,000 cases and more than 3,000 deaths.
"The World Health Organization has warned that COVID-19 is the ""number one public enemy"" and is likely to be more powerful than terrorism".
According to the PubMed database (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/), in less than two months, more than 200 scientific articles on COVID-19 have been published, covering topics including virology, epidemiology, etiology, diagnosis and treatment since the first article on the genome sequence of several patients sampled was reported on 7 January 2020.
The paper intends to briefly review the research developments in new and relevant areas.
In possible paragraphs, we will try to compare COVID-19 with SARS and other coronavirus-related diseases called Middle East respiratory syndrome (a disease that became common in 2012).
We will discuss what we have learned so far about prevention and prevention and a number of important remaining questions.
Coronavirus have traditionally been considered non-fatal pathogens for humans and account for about 15% of common colds.
However, in the current century, we have faced two highly pathogenic human-borne coronavirus, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which caused the initial outbreak in China in 2003 and Saudi Arabia in 2012, respectively, and spread to other countries in a short time, causing terrible disease and death.
Thus, the current COVID-19 is the third coronavirus outbreak in recorded human history.
As shown in Figure 1, clusters of pneumonia with an unknown origin were first reported to the National Health Commission of China from Wuhan on December 31, 2019.
Seven days later, the coronavirus was discovered.
On 15 January 2020, the first case of footy was reported from Wuhan.
Meanwhile, the epidemic spread rapidly to neighboring cities, other provinces and countries.
On January 20, infections of health and medical personnel were reported, which showed that human-to-human transmission of the virus is also possible.
On 23 January, the city of Wuhan completed the quarantine and public transportation to and from it was halted.
On January 24, the first clinical study on the disease reported that out of 40 definite patients, only 21 had direct contact with the Wuhan seafood market, where the disease is believed to have originated from an unknown animal source.
On 30 January, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak a global health emergency.
As of the time of this report, the disease has spread throughout China and about 50 other countries worldwide.
As the situation is rapidly changing, the extent and severity of the outbreak must be determined.
On 11 February 2020, a multi-centre study involving 8,866 coronavirus patients including 4,021 specific COVID-19 patients showed the most recent outbreak of the epidemic as follows (https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/UlBi-HX_rHPXa1qHA2bhdA).
SARS-CoV-2 has infected people of all ages, but has mainly infected people aged 65-30.
Nearly half (47.7%) of the infected females were over 50 years of age, with very few under 20 years of age and only 14 individuals under 10 years of age.
SARS-CoV-2 infects men (0.31 out of 100,000) more than women (0.27 out of 100,000).
COVID-19 spread in clusters in and around Hubei.
The average COVID-19 diagnosis took 5 days (9-2 days) from the start.
The average duration of the commune (7.2-3.0) is 4.8 days.
The average time from onset of disease to death (13-4.8) was 9.5 days.
The base multiplication rate (R<sub>0</sub>) was equal to 3.77 (with a confidence limit of: 4.05-3.51) and the adjusted R<sub>0</sub> was 4.82-2.23.
The number of infected fractures increased significantly before 23 January 2020, coinciding with the time of the increase in travel volumes ahead of the Spring Festival in China.
Confirmed mortality among patients was 1.44% (with 95% confidence interval equivalent: 1.86-1.10) and the moderated mortality among all patients was 3.06% (with 95% confidence interval equivalent: 4.59-2.02).
The three main risk factors for COVID-19 were gender (male), age (60 years or older) and severe pneumonia.
Coronavirus are a subfamily of large, covert viruses that contain a single strand of significant RNA.
They are classified into four genera, namely alpha, beta, gamma, and delta, which include the alpha and beta viruses that infect humans.
The glycoprotein spike (S) covers the SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV viruses and binds to their cell receptors, respectively, the angiotensin-2 (ACE2) and dipeptideyl peptidase-4 (DPP4) converting enzymes, and binds to the cell membrane.
The viral RNA genome is released into the cytoplasm; after viral genome replication, the genome RNA, together with a coating of glycoproteins and nucleoacid proteins, forms virion-containing vesicles that are then fused with the plasma membrane, leading to the release of a new virus.
The first genome sequence of SARS-CoV-2 was reported on 10 January 2020.
The findings showed that SARS-CoV-2 is a new strain of beta coronavirus with 10 samples found from the main outbreak site at the Hunan Seafood Market in Wuhan, with a 99.98% similarity.
The SARS-CoV-2 virus is genetically more similar to SARS-CoV than MERS-CoV.
The electron microscope detected SARS-CoV-2 particles in ultra-thin sections of the epithelium of human airways.
Human ACE2 is known as the SARS-CoV-2 virus receptor and also SARS-CoV.
However, the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 virus establishes a weak link to the human ACE2 receptor compared to SARS-CoV-2 which corresponds to the fact that SARS-CoV-2 virus causes a weak disease compared to SARS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 also produces a new short protein encoded by orf3b and a filtration protein encoded by orf8.
The SARS-CoV-2 orf3b protein plays a role in the pathogenic properties of the virus and inhibits the expression of IFNβ (interferon beta); however, orf8 does not contain any known secondary or functional motif.
On February 18, 2020, Zoe and colleagues reported the human ACE2 receptor complementary cryoprotective electron microscope structure with a 2.9-angstrom resolution in a complex with an amino acid carrier called B0AT1.
They found that the above complex, which has open and closed conformations, is assembled as a dimer and the ACE2-B0AT1 complex can bind to two S proteins that can be used as a standard for detecting and contaminating coronavirus.
B0AT1 may become a therapeutic target for drug screening to combat SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Middle origin and host
It has been found that SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV viruses both originated in bats and were transmitted to humans by cat litter and shrimp, respectively.
In a phylogenetic comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with other coronaviruses, bats were introduced as the primary host for SARS-CoV-2, as the new virus is 96% similar to the two SARS-like coronaviruses from bats, bat-SL-CoVZX45 and bat-SL-CoVZX21.
However, which intermediate host has helped the virus cross a certain border and infect humans is unknown, and the route of transmission must be clearly defined.
G and colleagues suggested that snakes were transmitted from bats to humans by homologous neutrophils within the S protein.
According to a study, researchers in Guangzhou, China, suggested that pangolins - long-horned mammal-like ants often used in traditional Chinese medicine - are a possible mediator host of SARS-CoV-2 based on genetic homology with a coronavirus discovered in pangolins and SARS-CoV-2.
However, the 1% difference between the two genomes is a significant difference; therefore, definitive results are expected for consistent evidence (Figure 3).
The physical and chemical properties of SARS-CoV-2 are largely unknown.
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV can survive in-vitro for 48 hours in a dry environment, with a temperature of less than 20 degrees Celsius and humidity of 50%-40%, for up to 5 days.
The SARS-CoV-2 virus may have similar characteristics.
SARS-CoV-2 has been reported to be sensitive to the following fractions that can effectively inactivate the virus: UV radiation and exposure to temperatures of 56 degrees Celsius for 30 minutes; ether, 75% ethanol, antifungal solution containing chlorine, prostactic acid, chloropher and other fatty solvents, but chlorhexidine does not have such a capacity.
Overall, all human populations are immune to SARS-CoV-2 and are therefore susceptible to the new virus.
At present, no immunological response to SARS-CoV-2 has been reported in any study.
Therefore, we can only refer to previous studies on other coronaviruses, especially SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Figure 4).
Generally, the virus is detected by the host's intrinsic immune system initially after an attack on the host body, with prototype detection receptors (PRRs) including -C type semi-lactin receptors, semi-pass receptor (TLR), semi-NOD receptor (NLR), and semi-RIG-I receptor (RLR).
The virus stimulates functions such as inflammatory expression, dental cell maturation and type I interferon synthesis (IFNs), which restrict the spread of the virus and accelerate the phagocytosis of viral antigens by the macrofaz.
However, the N protein associated with SARS-CoV can help to save the virus from immune system responses.
An adaptive immune response will soon be in place to fight the virus.
T lymphocytes include T cells of the CD4 and CD8 types, which play an important role in defense.
CD4++ T cells stimulate B cells to stimulate specific antibodies to the virus, and CD8++ T cells directly destroy cells infected with the virus.
T cells help to produce inflammatory cytokines to help defend cells.
However, the coronavirus can inhibit T cell function by inducing apoptosis.
Blood immunity includes compounds including C3a and C5a, and antibodies also play a role in fighting viral infection.
For example, antibodies isolated from a recovered patient neutralized MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, an excessive immune system reaction leads to a large amount of localized free radicals that can cause serious damage to the lungs and other organs, leading to multiple organ failure and even death in the worst case.
The likelihood of contracting SARS-CoV-2, a cluster outbreak of its own characteristics, is higher among those with the disease and pregnant women.
It is normal for people with high numbers of viruses or those with impaired immune function to have a higher chance of infection than others.
The average duration of the SARS-CoV-2 virus is approximately 1 to 14 days, with a study of the first 425 patients in Wuhan showing that this duration is mainly 3 to 7 days.
However, a study of 1,099 patients showed that the average duration of the periodicity was 3 days and varied from 0 to 24 days in total.
A more recent study, cited above, based on a demographic survey of 8,866 patients, reported a common duration of 4.8 (7.2-3.0) days.
It is very important for health authorities to impose effective quarantine times based on the correct duration of the commune to prevent transmission of the virus to others by the infected but without symptoms.
As a general rule, people infected with the virus or infected should be quarantined for 14 days.
Should the quarantine period be increased to 24 days?
Often, fever is the primary and primary symptom of COVID-19, which may occur alone or accompanied by other symptoms such as dry cough, shortness of breath, muscle pain, headache, sore throat, diarrhea, chest pain, diarrhea, nausea and vomiting.
Some patients developed shortness of breath and/or decreased tissue oxygen within a week of the onset of the disease.
In severe fractures, symptoms of acute respiratory syndrome, infectious shock, metabolic acidosis and blood clotting disorders were observed in patients.
Patients with fever and/or symptoms of respiratory and acute fever, even if they lack abnormalities in the imaging of the bladder, should be screened for rapid diagnosis of infection with the virus.
A demographic study in late December 2019 showed that the percentage of symptoms seen in patients were as follows: 98% fever, 76% dry cough, 55% shortness of breath and 3% diarrhea; 8% of patients needed ventilation.
Similar findings have been reported in two recent studies on a family cluster and a cluster formed by the transmission of sperm from unsigned individuals.
In comparison, a 2012 demographic study found that MERS-CoV patients also had fever (98%), dry cough (47%) and shortness of breath (55%) as the main symptoms of the disease.
However, 80% of them needed respiratory support, which was much higher than COVID-19 patients and corresponded to a higher mortality rate than COVID-19.
Diarrhoea (26%) and sore throat (21%) were also observed in patients with MS.
In SARS patients, the main symptoms of the disease were fever (99% to 100%), dry cough (29% to 75%), shortness of breath (40% to 42%), diarrhea (20% to 25) and sore throat (13% to 25%), and about 14% to 20% of patients needed a respiratory aid.
As of February 14, when the worldwide confirmed mortality rate reached 66,576, the global COVID-19 death rate was 2%.
For comparison, the SARS death rate as of November 2002 was confirmed to be 10% of 8,096 patients.
In Mercer, the mortality rate was 37% of the 2,494 patients diagnosed, according to a demographic study in June 2012.
An earlier study reported that the SARS-CoV-2 virus <i>R</i><i><sub>0</i></sub> is high and equal to 6.47 with a confidence interval (CI) of 7.23-5.71, while the SARS-Cov virus <i>R0</i> was only 2 to 4.
Comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with MERS-CoV and SARA-CoV in relation to symptoms, mortality and <i>R</i><i><sub>0</i></sub> is presented in Table 1.
The above figures suggest that SARS-CoV-2 has a higher potential for transmission compared to MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, but the mortality rate is lower than these two categories.
Therefore, controlling the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic is much more challenging than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV.
Clusters often begin within a family or community or a single vehicle such as a recreational boat.
Patients often have a history of travel or residence in Wuhan or other infected areas or have been in contact with infected people or patients within two weeks of the onset of the disease.
However, it has been reported that people can carry the virus for more than two weeks without any symptoms and that patients who have recovered and been discharged from hospital may have the virus in their bodies, leading to an alert to increase the period of quarantine.
In the early stages, the number of surrounding white spheres (especially lymphocytes) in patients is normal or decreases.
For example, lymphophony with a white blood cell count of less than 10<sup>9</sup>×4 cells per liter, including a lymphocyte count of less than 10<sup>9</sup>×1 cells per liter and increased concentrations of aminotransferase aspartate and viremia (viral blood count) were observed in 1,099 COVID-19 patients.
Levels of liver and muscle enzymes and myoglobin in the blood of some patients were found to be abnormal and the C-reactive protein and edemacination of erythrocytes in the blood of most patients increased.
In the severely affected kidneys, levels of D-dimer, a product of the breakdown of fibrin in the blood, increased and the number of lymphocytes in the tube decreased.
Abnormalities in chest shelf radiography are found in most COVID-19 patients and include shadows of symmetrical shards or glass-shaped squares in the lungs.
Patients often develop an abnormal pneumonia, acute bladder injury, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
When acute respiratory distress syndrome occurs, uncontrolled inflammation, fluid buildup and progressive fibrosis severely impair the exchange of respiratory gases.
Functional impairment of the pituitary nomasis of type one and type two reduces the amount of surfactant and, as a result, increases surface tension, which in itself reduces the lung's ability to expand and increases the risk of a pituitary collapse.
Thus, the worst radiographic findings of the chest shelf corresponded to the most severe cases of the disease.
On 18 February 2020, the first pathological analysis of COVID-19 revealed the following symptoms: paralysis of pulmonary neumocytes, formation of transparent lining, translucent translucent lymphocytes, and observation of the cyanocytic cell wall in the lungs of patients who died from the disease; symptoms that were consistent with the pathology of viral infection and ARDS (acute respiratory distress syndrome) and similar to those of SARS and MS patients.
RNA detection of SARS-CoV-2 virus through reverse polymerase transcriptase chain reaction (RT-PCR) has been used as the main criterion for the diagnosis of COVID-19.
However, due to the high false negative rate that may accelerate the epidemic, clinical demonstrations for diagnosis began to be used in China on February 13, 2020 (a diagnostic method that no longer relies solely on RT-PCR).
A similar situation existed with the diagnosis of SARS.
Therefore, a combination of disease history, clinical demonstrations, laboratory tests, and radiological findings is essential and necessary for effective diagnosis.
On February 14, 2020, the Feng Zhang group introduced the CRISPR-based SHERLOCK protocol for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 virus, in which RNA fragments of the SARS-CoV-2 virus are detected in a volume of <sup>18-</sup>10 × 20 moles per liter to <sup>18-</sup>10 × 200 moles per liter (100-10 copies per input microloliter) per bar in less than an hour without the need for complex equipment.
It is hoped that this new technique, if approved in clinical samples, will improve sensitivity and comfort.
Due to the lack of experience with the new coronavirus, doctors primarily provide supportive care to COVID-19 patients, while also attempting to use various therapeutic measures that have been used or recommended to treat previous cases of coronavirus outbreaks, including SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV and other viral diseases (Table 2).
These treatments include psychological and potential treatments with antiviral drugs, immune system suppressants, steroids, improved patient plasma, Chinese medicine, and psychological support.
Even the use of improved patient plasma has been proposed for the treatment of new patients.
Pharmaceutical companies are competing to produce antibodies and vaccines against the virus.
SARS-CoV-2 primarily attacks the lungs and, to a lesser extent, other ACE2 receptor-expressing organs such as the digestive system and kidneys.
However, respiratory disorders and respiratory failure are the main threat to patients and the leading cause of death.
Therefore, assisted breathing procedures are critical to alleviating symptoms and saving lives of patients, and include treatment with normal oxygen, long oxygen circulation, non-invasive ventilation, and aggressive mechanical ventilation depending on the severity of the disease.
Patients suffering from severe respiratory symptoms should undergo an ECMO, a modified post-cardiovascular technique that has been used to treat cardiovascular or fatal respiratory failure.
In addition, maintaining electrolyte balance, preventing and treating secondary infections and infectious shock, and protecting vital organ functions are also essential in relation to patients infected with SARS-CoV-2.
Cytoquinine has been shown to be caused by an overreaction of the immune system in patients with SARS and MS.
Cytochrome cytoquination is a type of systemic inflammatory reaction characterized by the release of a series of cytocyanins including TNFα, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6, IFNα, IFNβ, IFNγ, and MCP-1.
These cytokines cause immune system cells to release abundant free radicals, which is the main cause of ARDS and organ failure.
Immunosuppression is essential in the treatment of cytocin, especially in acute patients.
Corticosteroids and tosylizumab, an anti-IL6 monoclonal antibody, have been used to treat cytoquin storm.
Other immunosuppressive therapeutic approaches to cytochrome cytoquin include: T cell-commanded immune response modulation; IFN-γ, IL-1 and TNF inhibitors; JAK inhibitors; Blinatomump inhibitors; cytoquin signaling inhibitors 4; and HDAC inhibitors.
Steroids have been widely used as an immune system suppressant in the treatment of SARS with the aim of reducing the severity of inflammatory damage.
However, high-dose steroids were not useful for treating severe bladder damage in COVID-19 and SARS patients.
Instead, they may cause serious side effects, particularly bone fractures caused by anemia that significantly affect the prognosis of the disease.
However, it is recommended that short-term treatment with corticosteroids in low to medium doses be used with caution to treat patients with critical COVID-19.
At the time of writing, no effective antiviral drug has been approved.
However, an intravenous injection of a remdesivir, a nucleotide analogue, has been found to be effective in a US patient infected with COVID-19.
Remdesivir is a novel antiviral drug developed by Gilead and primarily intended to treat diseases caused by the Ebola and Marburg viruses.
Later, it was discovered that remdesivir may also have a inhibitory effect on other single stranded RNA viruses, including the MERS and SARS viruses.
Gilead provided the compound to China to be tested in two clinical trials on SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals, and the results were as expected.
In addition, baricytinb, interferon alfa, lupinevir/retonavir and ribavirin were also used as potential medicines for treating patients with acute respiratory symptoms.
Diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting, liver damage and other adverse reactions can occur following combination therapy with lupinovir/retonavir.
Interactions between these and other medicines used by the patient should be carefully examined.
Plasma from patients improved and antibody production
The collection of blood from patients who have recovered from an infectious disease has a long-standing promise to treat other patients with the same disease or protect healthy people from infection.
In fact, recovered patients often have relatively high levels of antibodies to combat the pathogen in their blood.
Antibodies, immunoglobulins (Ig), are produced by B lymphocytes to fight against pathogens and other foreign particles that identify and directly neutralize unique molecules in pathogens.
Accordingly, plasma was collected from a group of patients recovering from COVID-19 and injected into 10 very severe patients.
Their symptoms improved within 24 hours and a reduction in inflammation, a reduction in viral load and improved saturated oxygen in their blood was observed.
However, the proposal for a large-scale use of this method before specific therapeutic methods are yet to be proposed requires further approval and transparency.
In addition, alongside therapeutic effects, the disadvantages associated with plasma therapy should also be carefully considered.
For example, antibodies can over-exciter the immune response and cause cytokine-release syndrome, which may result in a deadly toxicity.
Antibody concentrations in the blood are usually low and high plasma levels are necessary for the treatment of people with very severe disease.
The development and production of specific antibodies in a rapidly changing time frame is difficult to cope with global epidemics.
Thus, separating B cells from patients has improved and identifying genetic codes that encode effective antibodies or screening for antibodies that are effective against viral proteins is more critical and practical.
This can easily increase the production of antibodies.
Traditional medicine has been used in China for thousands of years to treat a wide range of diseases.
However, its effectiveness depends largely on a combination of several exceptions to a formula that relies on the diagnosis of disease based on theories of traditional Chinese medicine.
Most of the active ingredients remain unknown or obscure because it is difficult to extract and validate these ingredients or their optimal combinations.
Currently, due to the lack of effective and specific treatment for COVID-19, TCM (traditional Chinese medicine) is considered as one of the main alternative therapies for patients with mild to moderate symptoms or for patients who have recovered from severe stages.
For example, Shu Feng Jie Du and Lian Hua Qing Wen capsules were found to be effective in treating COVID-19.
The highest rates of COVID-19 patient treatment were seen in several provinces in China where traditional Chinese medicine was used for 87 percent of patients, including Gansu (63.7%), Ningxia (50%) and Hunan (50%), while Hubei province, where traditional Chinese medicine was used for only about 30 percent of COVID-19 patients, had the lowest recovery rate (13%).
However, this is a fairly difficult comparison, as many other influencing factors such as the number and severity of patients must be considered in the assessment.
On February 18, 2020, Boley Zhang and colleagues published a study in which they compared Western medicine (WM) alone with combination medicine and traditional Chinese medicine.
They found that the time required to return body temperature to optimal, symptomatic, and hospitalized levels in the Western + Traditional Chinese medicine group was significantly less than the Western-only group.
Interestingly, the symptomatic disease exacerbation rate (from mild to severe) for the WM+TCM (traditional Chinese medicine+Western medicine) group was significantly lower than the Western medicine-only group (7.4% vs. 46.2%) and the mortality rate in the Western medicine+traditional medicine group was also lower than the Western medicine-only group (8.8% vs. 39%).
However, the efficacy and safety of traditional Chinese medicine should be assessed through rigorously controlled trials on a larger scale and at more centres.
The attempt to determine the mechanism of action and the effective components of traditional Chinese medicine methods or, if possible, a combination of them is interesting and tempting.
Suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patients often experience panic attacks from many of these highly contagious and even fatal diseases, and quarantined people also experience boredom, loneliness and anger.
In addition, symptoms of infection can include fever, lack of oxygen and cough, as well as side effects of treatment options including corticosteroid insomnia, anxiety and psychiatric discomfort.
In the early phase of the SARS outbreak, a range of psychiatric conditions were reported including persistent depression, anxiety, panic attacks, motor neurone disease, symptoms of psychosis, psychosis, and even suicidal tendencies.
Contact tracking and mandatory quarantine, as part of public health responses to the COVID-19 outbreak, can cause stress and guilt in infected populations regarding the effects of confinement, quarantine and status issues for families and friends.
Therefore, mental health care should be available to COVID-19 patients, suspects and those who have been in contact with them, as well as the general public who need it.
Psychological support should include the formation of multi-speciality mental health teams, transparent communication with regular and accurate news on the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2, and treatment programs with the use of electronic devices and verbal applications to prevent close contact with others.
Effective vaccines are of fundamental importance for cutting the chain of transmission from infected animal reservoirs and human vertebrae to sensitive hosts and are often considered an antiviral supplement in the control of epidemics caused by emerging viruses.
Efforts have been made to develop S-protein-based vaccines to produce antibodies with long-term function and powerful neutralization and/or protective immunity against SARS-CoV.
Dissolved live vaccines have been tested in animal models for SARS.
However, before a clinical study can begin, the in-vivo efficacy of these vaccine candidates in cats and dying models and their protection against Xenophobia virus infection must be determined.
This is probably because SARS went extinct 17 years ago and no new cases have been reported since.
In contrast, isolated fractures and occasional clusters of mercury comatose are found in the Middle East and spread to other regions due to the stability of the resources of the zeonoses in indigenous areas.
Vaccination strategies using inactive viruses, DNA plasmids, viral vectors, nanoparticles, quasi-viral particles and neutrophil protein subunits were developed for Mars and tested in some fractions on animal models.
Developing a safe and effective vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 for people with low immunity is an urgent and critical issue for controlling the growing epidemic.
However, tackling this problem is challenging due to the long time it takes to design and produce a vaccine (average 18 months) and the dynamic evolution of coronavirus.
As an emerging disease, COVID-19 has recently begun to develop a clinical period of complementary medicine in thousands of patients.
In most cases, patients recover gradually and without any subsequent complications.
However, like SARS and MS, COVID-19 is also associated with high levels of malnutrition and mortality in severely ill patients.
Therefore, designing a disease prevention model is critical for healthcare providers to prioritize their services, especially in areas with limited resources.
Based on clinical studies conducted so far, the following factors may affect or be associated with the diagnosis of COVID-19 patients (Table 3:
Age: Age is the most important factor in the spread of SARS, as is the case with COVID-19.
COVID-19 occurs mainly in people aged 65-30, with 47.7% of those over 50 years of age being infected in a study involving 8,866 patients described above.
Patients who needed special care were more likely to suffer from bipolar disorder and underlying conditions and were older than patients who did not need special care (with an average age of 66 versus 51), suggesting that age could be considered as a predictor of outcome for COVID-19 patients.
Gender: As mentioned above, SARS-CoV-2 has infected more men than women (0.31 per 100,000 compared to 0.27 per 100,000).
Tumour and complications: Patients with COVID-19 who require special care are more likely to develop acute heart disease or arrhythmia.
Heart problems were also the leading cause of death among SARS patients.
It has been reported that SARS-CoV-2 can also bind to ACE2-positive clenbuterol, which may lead to liver disorders in COVID-19 patients.
It should be noted that age and disease are strongly intertwined and may interfere with each other.
Abnormal laboratory findings: The level of C-reactive protein in the blood reflects the severity of inflammation or tissue damage and has been suggested as a potential diagnostic factor for disease, response to treatment and ultimate recovery.
It has been suggested that there is a link between CRP levels with severity and COVID-19 prevention.
In addition, elevated levels of dehydrogenated lactate (LDH), aminotransferase aspartate (AST), aminotransferase alanine (ALT) and creatine kinase (CK) may also be effective in predicting outcome.
These enzymes are highly expressed in several tissues, especially in the heart and liver, and are released when tissue damage occurs.
Therefore, they are traditional markers for the diagnosis of heart or liver disorders.
Key clinical symptoms: Chest radiography and timing of clinical symptoms should be considered along with other relevant issues to predict the consequences and consequences of COVID-19.
Steroid use: As explained above, steroids are immune system suppressants that are commonly used as complementary therapies to reduce the severity of inflammatory injury in the fight against infectious diseases.
Since high doses of corticosteroids were widely used in severe SARS patients, many survivors of bone fractures resulting from low blood pressure suffered from long-term disability and low quality of life.
Therefore, if necessary, steroids should be used at lower doses and for short-term use in COVID-19 patients.
Mental stress: As explained above, due to the COVID-19 outbreak, many patients became overly stressed because they were often forced to observe long quarantine periods, had many doubts and suspicions about past events, and witnessed the death of family members or close friends.
Providing psychological counseling and long-term support is essential to help these patients relieve stress and return to normal life.
According to demographic studies conducted so far, COVID-19 has different epidemiological characteristics compared to SARS.
SARS-CoV-2 can effectively reproduce in the upper respiratory tract in addition to the lower respiratory tract, as can other common cold-causing coronaviruses, and is mildly symptomatic or symptomless at the beginning of the infection phase.
Thus, infected patients in the early or long term can produce large amounts of the virus during daily activities, which can cause many problems for epidemic control.
However, the findings suggest that SARS-CoV transmission occurred when patients were in the acute phase of the disease, so most cases of transmission did not occur in the initial phase.
Therefore, the current outbreak of COVID-19 is more dangerous and more difficult to control than the SARS outbreak.
Excellent efforts are underway in China, including supplementary entry and exit controls to Wuhan and nearby cities and ongoing quarantine of almost the entire population in hopes of cutting the SARS-CoV-2 transmission chain.
Although these measures have significantly damaged the economy and other parts of the country, the number of new cases is declining, indicating a slowdown in the epidemic.
The most optimistic estimate is that the outbreak will end by March and the phase of its trend analysis will last three to four months.
However, some experts are not very optimistic.
Paul Hunter and colleagues estimate that the COVID-19 epidemic, which is significantly more contagious than SARS, will not end in 2020.
Ira Langini and colleagues designed a model to predict the outcome of an epidemic and suggested that the SARS-CoV-2 virus could infect two-thirds of the world's population.
A Canadian team reported that SARS-CoV-2 was detected in both sets of nasal and throat swab samples in patients who had recovered from their discharge from hospital 2 weeks earlier.
However, based on the reduction in the number of new infections, which means the potential success of current strategies, promising prospects are seen in China.
Initially, it was predicted that Ebola would infect up to one million people and cause half a million deaths.
However, the means of quarantine and strict isolation eventually brought the disease under control.
Similar to SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 may gradually become weaker and eventually disappear or become a virus with less pathogenic characteristics that lives alongside humans.
A comparison of the COVID-19 epidemic with SARS and MS is presented below (Figure 5).
SARS-CoV-2 has a high transmission rate through coughing or sneezing and is likely to be transmitted through direct contact with contaminated substances.
The virus was also found in the gut material, which raised the possibility of new transmission from the gut-famy.
A recent study of 138 patients reported that 41% of patients were likely to become infected by hospital infections, including 17 patients with other diseases and 40 healthcare staff.
Therefore, extreme care and attention must be taken to protect humans, especially healthcare workers, social workers, family members, colleagues and even visitors to infected patients or infected persons.
The first line of defense that can be used to reduce the risk of infection is to wear face masks; the use of both surgical masks and N95 respiratory masks (series number 1860s) helps control the spread of viruses.
Surgical masks prevent airborne transmission of breathing fluid droplets from potentially infected vertebrae to others or the attachment of these droplets to the surface of the material and then after transmission to others.
However, N95 masks (number of 1860s) can protect against respiratory variants that can eat 10 to 80 nanometers, a proportion that only 5% of variants can penetrate; SARS-CoV-2 is similar in size to SARS-CoV and is approximately 85 nanometers in size.
Since particles can even pass through five surgical masks, healthcare providers in direct contact with patients should use N95 masks (series number 1860s) and refrain from wearing surgical masks.
In addition to masks, healthcare workers must wear fully covered isolates to reduce the risk of contagion.
Viruses can also infect a person through the eyes.
On 22 January 2020, a doctor was infected with SARS-CoV-2 while wearing a N95 mask; his inflamed eyelid may have entered his body.
Therefore, healthcare providers should also use transparent face shields or glasses when dealing with patients.
In order to ensure public health in areas that are contaminated or potentially contaminated, it is strongly recommended that people wash their hands with disinfectant soaps more than usual, self-quarantine, stay at home and limit contact with potentially infected people.
The appropriate distance for people to be with patients is three feet.
These measures are considered effective methods to reduce and prevent the spread of the virus.
Although the SARS-CoV-2 virus is known to be a novel virus for the human world, its high homology to SARS-CoV, reported on 7 January 2020, was raised as a serious warning to China, and brought to mind the 2003 SARS outbreak.
However, no effort was made to bring public peace until 19 January 2020, the day the head of the Wuhan Center for Disease Control announced that the new virus had limited human-to-human transmission capabilities and was capable of preventing and controlling disease.
The message made the public warnings less serious, especially as the entire country prepared to host the New Year's Day celebration, and thus missed a crucial opportunity to prevent the spread of the disease on its limited scale in Wuhan.
Disease control agencies in China may have learned this hard lesson and made key improvements to future measures.
For example, these organizations should (1) be more careful when informing the public because anything they claim will be taken public notice and can change attitudes and decisions; (2) be more sensitive and responsive to abnormal information from clinics, rather than waiting for official reports from responsible doctors or authorities; (3) act more strictly to contain a potential epidemic in the early stages rather than inviting the public to calm down; (4) consistently, purposefully and effectively make public information available to increase public awareness of epidemic disease and continue to test and improve the public response system.
The outbreak of COVID-19, caused by the new SARS-CoV-2 virus, began in late December 2019.
In less than two months, the disease has spread throughout China and to about 50 other countries worldwide as of this writing.
Since the virus is very similar to SARS-CoV and the symptoms of COVID-19 and SARS are similar, the COVID-19 outbreak has led to the perception that SARS is back.
However, there are several distinct differences between COVID-19 and SARS that are of fundamental importance for the prevention of epidemics and the treatment of patients.
COVID-19 affects older people and men more than young people and women and also has a higher mortality rate in the elderly than in the young.
The mortality rate for SARS is higher than that of COVID-19 (10.91% vs. 1.44%).
COVID-19 patients transmit the disease even when they are symptomatic, while SARS patients usually do so when the disease is very severe, making it much more difficult to prevent the spread of COVID-19 than SARS.
This partly explains why the SARS-CoV-2 virus spreads much faster and on a larger scale than SARS-CoV.
In some COVID-19 patients, a routine RNA test for the SARS-CoV-2 virus may result in a negative result.
On the other hand, patients who recovered can become infected with the virus again.
These findings dramatically increase the risk of the virus spreading.
Given the rapid progress rate in COVID-19 research, there are still several critical unresolved issues, including:
Where did SARS-CoV-2 come from?
Although 96% of genetic homology between SARS-CoV-2 and two SARS-CoV-like bats has been found, we still cannot conclude that SARS-CoV-2 originated from bats.
What animal was the intermediate species for transmitting the virus from its original host, bats, to humans?
Without knowing the answers to questions 1 and 2, we cannot effectively disrupt the transmission chain and the outbreak may resume at any time.
Although molecular modeling and biochemical assessments have shown that SARS-CoV-2 binds to ACE2 receptors, how exactly does the virus enter airway cells and provide the basis for subsequent pathological transformations?
Does the virus bind to ACE2 expression cells in other organs?
Until these questions are clearly answered, we will not be able to find a fast, accurate diagnosis and effective treatment.
How long will an epidemic last?
How does the virus evolve genetically during transmission between humans?
Will it become a global pandemic, disappear like SARS, or recur like influenza?
Finding the answer to the above and many other questions is essential but may take some time.
However, regardless of the costs, our only option is to stop the epidemic as soon as possible and return life to normal.
Animal origins of human coronavirus
For thousands of years, mutation and adaptation have contributed to the simultaneous evolution of coronavirus (CoVs) and their hosts, including humans.
Prior to 2003, two human coronavirus (HCoVs) were known to cause mild illnesses, such as conventional seizures.
The outbreak of acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) has caused other coins to appear and has shown the extent of damage and potential risk of human coronavirus infection.
The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in central China in late 2019 brought the coronavirus back to the spotlight and surprised us with its long-term transmission potential, but its pathogenic potential is lower compared to its sister SARS-CoV.
Human coronavirus infection is zoonosis, and identifying the animal origin of human coronavirus can help us well.
Most human coronaviruses originate from bats, which are non-pathogenic.
Intermediate storage source hosts of some human coronavirus are also known.
Identifying host animals directly helps prevent human diseases.
Research into the interactions of coronavirus hosts in animals can provide important information about pathogenicity in humans.
In this review, we provide an overview of the available information about seven existing human coronavirus, focusing on their discovery history as well as animal origin and interspecies transmission.
Most importantly, we compare and contrast different human coronaviruses from the perspective of virus evolution and genomic sequencing.
The current coronavirus pandemic 2019 (COVID-19) is being discussed in this context.
In addition, the conditions for successful transfer between hosts and symptoms of the virus's evolution over the severity of the disease have also become a focus.
Coronavirus (CoVs) are members of the family Coronaviridae, which includes a group of single-stranded, sub-positive RNA-covered viruses.
"These viruses, which have the largest genome of 26 to 32 kilobytes among RNA viruses, were poisoned under an electronic microscope, ""CoVs (coronavirus) "" or coronaviruses due to their own coronary morphology".
Structurally, coronaviruses have single-piece genomes that have a similar organization.
About two-thirds of the genome, including two open reading frames, are homologous (ORF1a and ORF1b) which are translated as polyprotein replicas pp1a and pp1ab.
Polyproteins are further processed to produce 16 non-structural proteins, which are termed nsp1 to 16.
The remaining proteins of the genome include ORFs for structural proteins, including spike (S), viral coating (E), membrane (M) and nucleoprotein (N).
A number of lineage-specific side proteins are encoded by different forms of the coronavirus.
Due to differences in protein sequence, coronaviruses are divided into four genera (alphaviruses, betaviruses, gammaviruses, and deltaviruses) and among them, the betaviruses genus comprises the majority of human coronaviruses and is divided into four sub-lineages (A, B, C, and D).
Phylogenetic evidence has shown that bats and rodents act as the genetic source of most alpha and beta coronaviruses, while birds are the primary reservoir for gamma coronaviruses and delta coronaviruses.
For thousands of years, coronaviruses have consistently crossed interspecies barriers, some emerging as important human pathogens.
To date, seven human coronavirus strains have been identified.
Among them are HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63 of the alpha coronavirus.
The other five beta viruses include HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, SARS-CoV (acute acute respiratory syndrome causing virus), MERS-CoV (Middle East respiratory syndrome causing virus) and SARS-CoV-2.
HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63 are commonly associated with mild symptoms such as normal diarrhea and/or diarrhea.
In contrast, recently identified SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are highly pathogenic and cause severe respiratory tract infections in almost all patients, increasing the likelihood of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and out-of-poison demonstrations.
The first strain of HCoV-229E, B814, was isolated from the nasal mucosa of patients who became infected with the disease in the mid-1960s.
Since then, more information has been gained through extensive studies on HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, both of which cause self-limiting symptoms.
In fact, before the SARS outbreak, the concept was widely accepted that human coronavirus infections were generally harmless.
The 2003 SARS outbreak is one of the most devastating examples of the modern era, with more than 8,000 people infected and a mortality rate of about 10%.
Ten years later, the outbreak of Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome (MERS) led to a persistent outbreak in the Arabian Peninsula, with rare cases spreading to the rest of the world.
The 2019 novel human coronavirus (2019-nCoV), later renamed SARS-CoV-2, is the cause of the ongoing coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19) and has killed 3,120 people and infected more than 91,000 people as of March 3, 2020.
The alarm has sounded and the world needs to prepare for the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.
All seven human coronavirus strains have animal origins in bats, rats and domestic animals.
Multiple evidence supports the evolutionary origin of all human coronavirus, bats, in which viruses are well adapted but non-pathogenic and have high genetic diversity.
The COVID-19 epidemic has brought enormous medical, scientific, social and moral challenges to China and the world.
Tracing the animal origin of human coronavirus provides a framework for understanding natural history, motive power, and the limiting factors of varietal mutation.
It may also facilitate or guide research into the storage, mediation and replication of SARS-CoV-2 animals and be used to prevent similar incidents in the future.
In this study, we provide an overview of animal origin, interspecies transmission, and pathogenic function of human coronavirus.
In particular, we highlight and discuss the common occurrence that human coronavirus pathogens are typically non-pathogenic in their host reservoirs, but become pathogenic after interspecies transfer to a new host.
We also examine the evolution of human coronavirus, where an increase in transmissibility is often accompanied by a decrease in pathogenic function.
The outcome of the ongoing outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 is also discussed in this context.
Animal coronavirus have been known since the late 1930s.
Prior to the initial abstraction of HCoV-229E strain B814, different types of coronavirus were transmitted from infected animals, including buckwheat, mice, cows, pigs, shrimp and dogs, from the nasal mucus of patients infected with the disease.
In the past few decades, seven human coronavirus have been identified.
A brief summary of the history of human coronavirus detection in chronological order (Table 1) can be instructive and useful.
The first strain of HCoV-229E was obtained in 1966 from the respiratory tract of patients infected with the upper respiratory tract, and then adapted to grow in the WI-38 respiratory cell lines.
Patients with HCoV-229E showed symptoms such as common symptoms of falls, including headache, thirst, feeling sick and sore throat, along with fever and diarrhea in 10 to 20 percent of cases.
Then in 1967, HCoV-OC43 was isolated from tissue transplantation and subsequent sequence passage in the brains of rat cubs.
It is known that the clinical properties of HCoV-OC43 infection are similar to those of HCoV-229E, which is similar in symptoms to other respiratory pathogens, including influenza A and rhinovirus.
HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 are both globally spread and are generally transmitted during the winter season and in temperate climates.
In general, the incubation period of these two viruses is less than one week, and the disease is detected for a duration of approximately two weeks.
Based on a human study of volunteers, healthy people infected with HCoV-229E experienced mild falls.
Only a few patients with a weak immune system developed severe infections of the lower respiratory system.
"SARS, also known as the ""Atipic Pneumonia"", was the first documented pandemic case of human coronavirus in human history and the etiological cause of SARS-CoV, the third human coronavirus, has been discovered".
The first SARS case was detected in late 2002 in China's Guangdong province.
The SARS epidemic has resulted in 8,096 reported cases of infection with 774 reported deaths and has spread to many countries and continents.
Apart from mass-exposure events, it was estimated that each event could lead to almost two secondary infections, with a 4- to 7-day period of communicable disease and a peak viral load that occurs on the tenth day.
Patients infected with SARS-CoV initially had symptoms such as muscle pain, headache, fever, weakness and tremors, and then experienced shortness of breath, cough and shortness of breath in the final stages.
Lymphopeny, figures outside the scope of liver functional tests and high levels of creatine kinase are part of the abnormal laboratory results of common SARS.
In SARS patients, cases of dispersed aloecular damage, proliferation of epithelial cells and increased macrophages have also been observed.
About 20 to 30 percent of patients require intensive care and mechanical ventilation respectively.
In addition to the respiratory system, numerous organs, including the digestive system, liver and kidney, can become severely infected in these cases, a condition usually accompanied by a cytoquin storm and may be especially fatal in patients with weakened immune systems.
The virus was first isolated from a pulmonary biopsy of a relative of an indicated patient who had traveled from Guangzhou to Hong Kong.
Since then, a great deal of effort has been made to investigate the human coronavirus.
HCoV-NL63 was isolated from the Netherlands in late 2004 from a 7-month-old infant.
It was first observed to be common among young children, cranks and patients with poor immune systems or respiratory illnesses.
Falls, inflammation, fever and bronchiolitis are common in HCoV-NL63 strains.
Another independent study described the isolation of a similar virus from a nasal mucus sample of an 8-month-old child with a chest and wrist infection in the Netherlands.
Although this has been identified in the Netherlands, it has in fact been reported worldwide.
It is estimated that HCoV-NL63 is responsible for about 4.7% of respiratory tract infections and its prevalence peaks in early summer, spring and winter.
HCoV-NL63 is also associated with an inflammatory bowel disease, also known as throat inflammation.
In the same year, HCoV-HKU1 was isolated from a 71-year-old man who had been hospitalized in Hong Kong for breast and elbow and bronchiolitis.
In addition to the mass outbreak of breast and elbow and bronchiolitis, HCoV-HKU1 has also been reported to be associated with acute asthma exacerbation.
HCoV-HKU1 has been identified as a cause of mild respiratory illness worldwide, as have HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43.
All four human coronavirus cases with a mass outbreak were well adapted to humans and are generally less likely to mutate to cause long-term pathogens, although cases have been reported in rare cases for a subtype with a longer-term pathogenicity, HCoV-NL63, which was recently reported in China to cause severe respiratory tract infections.
In general, their contagion or pathogenicity decreases when these human coronaviruses gain the ability to transmit effectively and maintain their continuous presence in humans.
MERS-CoV was first isolated in 2012 in Saudi Arabia from the lungs of a 60-year-old patient with acute chest and wrist infections and inadequacy.
Although most confirmed laboratory cases originated in the Middle East, there have been several cases of imported cases and occasional secondary outbreaks due to close contact in European countries and Tunisia.
A second-degree outbreak occurred in South Korea in 2015, in which 186 cases were confirmed.
The clinical manifestations of MS are similar to SARS, which is characterized by a pronounced acute chest and wrist.
Unlike SARS, many patients with severe MERS are found to be inadequately trained, which is unique among human coronavirus-related diseases.
More than 30% of patients have gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhea and vomiting.
As of February 14, 2020, more than 2,500 laboratory-confirmed cases with a very high mortality rate of 34.4% have been reported, making MERS-CoV one of the most harmful viruses known to humans.
In mid-to-late December 2019, clusters of patients with chest and knee infections were found in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, which have now been identified as being associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection.
The World Health Organization has declared the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 respiratory tract infections to be an international public health emergency and has classified the disease as COVID-19.
As of March 3, 2020, there were 9,053 confirmed cases worldwide and the mortality rate was approximately 3.4%.
It is worth noting that the mortality rate in Hubei, China is 4.2% while abroad it is 1.2%.
SARS-CoV-2 is caused by severe respiratory infections such as SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV, which are characterized by fever, cough and shortness of breath.
Diarrhea has also been observed in some patients.
The chest and wrist is one of the most severe symptoms and can quickly become acute respiratory syndrome.
Although SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are very similar due to their 82% long nucleotide sequence homology, they are found in two different clusters of phylogenetic trees.
SARS-CoV-2 has clearly less pathogenic properties compared to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, but it is more likely to be transmitted.
Cases with no symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 have been reported and may contribute to its accelerated spread worldwide.
Comparing and finding differences between SARS-CoV-2 and six other human coronavirus strains suggests a number of similarities and differences that are very interesting.
First, the incubation period and duration of human coronavirus disease are very similar.
In this regard, SARS-CoV-2 represents the overall trend of six other human coronavirus strains.
Second, the severity of COVID-19 symptoms is between SARS-CoV and four human coronavirus with a mass outbreak (including HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63).
On the one hand, SARS-CoV-2 infection exhibits characteristics that are usually more common during infection with a mass outbreak of human coronavirus, including the presence of non-specific symptoms, mild symptoms or even lack of symptoms.
On the other hand, a small subset of severe COVID-19 cases may also be considered as a sample of SARS-CoV infection, although the proportion is slightly lower.
Third, transmission of SARS-CoV-2 continues to show interesting patterns that are indicative of both human coronavirus with a mass outbreak and SARS-CoV.
On the other hand, the transmission potential of SARS-CoV-2 is at least as high as other human coronavirus with a mass outbreak.
On the other hand, it should be determined whether the possibility of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 after infection to different humans is reduced, as was the case for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Finally, SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in viral samples, as can other human coronavirus.
It is not yet clear whether the gastrointestinal transmission of SARS-CoV-2, at least under certain conditions, plays a significant role similar to that of the SARS-CoV virus.
It is also interesting to see if SARS-CoV-2 is showing a seasonal mode, like cases of human coronavirus with a mass outbreak.
However, the characteristics of SARS-CoV-2, including its transmissibility, pathogenicity and sustained spread after human transmission, will influence the ultimate fate of the continued outbreak of COVID-19.
All four human coronavirus with a mass outbreak that cause mild symptoms have been well adapted to humans.
From another perspective, it may still be true to say that humans have adapted well to these four human coronaviruses.
In other words, both could be survivors of the old human coronavirus pandemic.
Human coronaviruses that cause severe human disease and humans that have been infected with severe human coronaviruses were excluded from the study.
To this end, human coronaviruses must be reproduced in humans sufficiently to allow the accumulation of adaptive mutations that neutralize the limiting factors of the host.
In this case, the more sustained the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak and the more people infected, the more chance the virus has of adapting the supplement to humans.
If the virus adapts well, it can hardly be prevented from spreading by quarantine or other contamination control methods.
Over the years, four coronaviruses with a mass outbreak were circulating among the human population and caused normal seizures in people with normal immune function.
These viruses do not require an animal reservoir.
In contrast, viruses with high pathogenic characteristics SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV have not been well adapted to humans and their transmission in humans has not been stable.
They must keep and reproduce themselves in animal reservoirs, usually by means of one or more intermediate and reproducing hosts, seeking an opportunity to transfer to sensitive human targets.
SARS-CoV-2 has similar characteristics to SARS-SARS-CoV/MERS-CoV and four human coronavirus with a mass outbreak.
Just like human coronavirus with a mass outbreak, it has a high transmission potential, at least for now.
However, it has more pathogenic properties than the coronavirus with a mass outbreak, except that its pathogenicity is lower compared to SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV.
Whether it is fully adapted to humans and can be transferred between humans without the need for a medium animal reservoir or host will be determined in the future.
Before discussing the animal origin of human coronavirus, it is best to talk about the definition and characteristics of the evolutionary, natural, reservoir, mediator and replicator hosts of human coronavirus.
An animal is considered an evolutionary host of a human coronavirus that is the refuge of a close ancestor and has a high homology at the level of nucleotide sequence.
An ancestral virus is usually well adapted to the host and is non-pathogenic.
Similarly, the reservoir host maintains the human coronavirus continuously and for a long time.
In both cases, hosts become naturally infected and act as natural hosts of the human coronavirus or its progenitor virus.
On the other hand, if the human coronavirus is recently, before or roughly simultaneously with introduction to humans, transferred to an intermediate host, it does not adapt well to the new host and is often pathogenic.
The median host can act as an animal source for human infection and play the role of a replicating host, allowing the virus to temporarily replicate and then transmit to humans to increase the scale of infection in humans.
A human coronavirus ends up as a deadly infection if it cannot maintain its transmission in the intermediate host.
Conversely, human coronaviruses can adapt to the median host and even cause long-term endemic disease.
In this case, the intermediate host becomes a natural storage host.
A review of epidemiological data revealed that the SARS indicator had a history of contact with prey animals.
Subsequent studies of serum prevalence showed that the prevalence of immunoglobulin G anti-SARS-CoV was higher among animal traders than among the general public.
Masked palm larvae (Paguma larvata) and a raccoon dog were first identified in live animal markets as carriers of SARS-CoV-like viruses that are almost identical to SARS-CoV.
This was indirectly proven by the fact that no other SARS cases were reported after all the bugs were killed in the market.
However, reported masked palm civets in the wild or on farms that had no contact with live animal markets were generally negative in terms of SARS-CoV infection, in other words, masked palm civets may act as a host medium for the virus, not a natural reservoir for SARS-CoV.
It is noteworthy that as 80% of the different animals in Guangzhou markets have antibodies to SARS-CoV, the possibility that multiple species of small mammals will act as hosts of the SARS-CoV replication medium cannot be ignored.
All of these are known to be the final hosts of SARS-CoV.
The search for a natural animal host SARS-CoV led to the discovery of a bat coronavirus very close to the one that is related to HKU3 (SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3) and is present in Chinese horse-drawn bats.
The results of the SARS-CoV antibody test and the SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3 genome sequence were positive in these bats.
These and other bat coronaviruses have a nucleotide sequence homology of 88-92% with SARS-CoV.
These studies established a new concept, meaning that bats are hosts of emerging human pathogens.
Several SARS-like coronaviruses (SL-CoVs) have also been identified from bats, but none of them can be classified as living viruses except for a virus called WIV1.
Human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is known as the SARS-CoV receptor.
WIV1 was found to use a sample of bat-borne substances, ACE2, bats, fungi and humans as a receptor for cell entry.
Interestingly, serum patients recovering from SARS were able to neutralize WIV1.
So far, WIV1 has shown the closest SARS-CoV ancestor in bats to have 95% of the common nucleotide sequence homology.
Despite the high homology between the two viruses, it is generally believed that WIV1 is not a paternal virus intermediate for SARS-CoV and that bats are not the first SARS-CoV reservoir hosts.
Phylogenetic analysis groups MERS-CoV into the same group of bats CoV-HKU4 and CoV-HKU5 bat.
Bat CoV-HKU4 and MERS-CoV both use a similar host receptor, called diptidal peptidease 4 (DPP4), to enter the virus.
RNA-dependent polymerase RNA sequences for MERS-CoV are phylogenetically closer to the bat-borne coronavirus species identified in Europe and Africa.
Currently, no live MERS-CoV has been found in wild bats.
MERS-CoV and its closest relative bat CoV-HKU25 have only 87% of the same nucleotide sequence homology.
Therefore, bats may not be the first host of the MERS-CoV repository.
On the other hand, studies in the Middle East have shown that dromedary camels are serum-positive, particularly against the MERS-CoV-specific neutralizing antibodies, similar to those of Middle Eastern origin found in several African countries.
MERS-CoV is a living virus similar to the virus found in humans, derived from a mountain shark's nasal sample, suggesting that the shark plays the role of the actual MERS-CoV reservoir host.
It is worth noting that in general, mild but severe viral propagation was observed in shirts that were experimentally infected with MERS-CoV.
It is worth noting that infected bats transmit the virus not only through respiratory but also through gastrointestinal-physical channels, which is the main method of transmission of the virus in bats.
However, questions remain, as many cases of MERS-infected people had no history of contact with shter before symptoms appeared, so the disease could be transmitted from human to human or through unknown animal species that were carriers of MERS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 is 96.2% homologous to the nucleotide of the bat RaTG13 coronavirus, which has been isolated from the bat Rhinolophus affinis.
As in the case of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the sequence variance between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is too large to be considered as a parental relationship.
In other words, bats may not be the first host of SARS-CoV-2's reservoir unless similar bat coronavirus is found in the future.
Presumably, the intermediate animal hosts of SARS-CoV-2 must have been among wildlife species that are hunted and killed in the Hunan seafood wholesale market, a trend that many early cases of COVID-19 were associated with and indicates a possible event of animal-to-human transmission.
Several new studies based on metagenomic sequence have shown that a group of small, endangered mammals called pangolin (Manis javanica) may also be the source of the SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoV-like ancestor.
These new coronavirus pangolin genomes have 85-92% nucleotide sequence homology with SARS-CoV-2.
However, they are about 90% similar in nucleotide sequence to RaTG13.
They form a cluster in a phylogenetic tree as two sub-linings of SARS-CoV-like viruses that have a more similar receptor-binding domain (RBD) to SARS-CoV-2 and a 97.4% amino acid sequence.
In a completely opposite way, SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 RBDs are more similar, although there is a greater sequence of homology in their genomes.
A previous study of patients with pangolin also reported the detection of viral infections from lung samples that were found to be similarly related to SARS-CoV-2.
The study used different collection methods and manual selection to create a partial genome sequence that contained about 86.3% of the length of viral genome supplementation.
We cannot ignore the possibility that pangolin is one of the intermediate animal hosts of SARS-CoV-2.
However, due to the sequence similarity between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2-related beta viruses in pangolin, there is currently no evidence of the direct origin of pangolin for SARS-CoV-2.
In addition, the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is even shorter than the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2-related beta viruses in the pangolin.
The evolutionary pathway of SARS-CoV-2 in bats, pangolins and other mammals must be determined.
While the highest homology matching in RBDs has been found between SARS-CoV-2 and pangolin, SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13-related beta viruses have the highest homology sequence sharing at the genome level.
It is thought that the high similarity between SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoV RBDs in the pangolin and SARS-CoV-2 is due to selective homogeneous evolution.
A mutual benefit proposal is a no-target relationship between a pandemic coronavirus beta-CoV-2 and RaTG13 in a third wild animal species.
Nootropics is promoted as a winning evolutionary force among beta-coronavirus.
The unbiased animal origin of SARS-CoV-2 is currently under investigation and cannot be confirmed with certainty.
In addition to highly pathogenic human coronaviruses, animal origins of HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1 have also been studied.
Phylogenetic evidence suggested that HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E may both have originated from the bat coronavirus, while the parent viruses HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 were found in females.
A bat coronavirus called ARCoV.2 (Appalachian Ridge CoV) identified in North American three-colored bats has been reported to be closely related to HCoV-NL63.
On the other hand, HCoV-229E is genetically related to another bat coronavirus, Hipposideros/GhanaKwam/19/2008, which was discovered in Ghana, while shrimp are thought to be its intermediate host.
For further clarification, current knowledge regarding the animal origin of human coronavirus is summarized in Figure 1 and Table 2.
Phylogenetic analysis has provided evidence for interspecies transmission events of human coronavirus throughout history.
When HCoV-OC43 discovered interspecies transmission from domesticated animals to humans in 1890, a respiratory infection pandemic was recorded.
The history of interspecies transmission of HCoV-229E is not well known.
Bat alphaviruses have been found to be closely related to SARS-CoV-2.
Among them is an alpha-alpha coronavirus.
Numerous evidence supports the importance of direct transmission of the virus from bats to humans.
First, humans may be in contact with bats, not alpacas, because of their presence in a common ecological niche.
Instead, humans are closely related to the alpacas.
Second, the bat alpha coronavirus associated with HCoV-229E is diverse and non-contaminant in bats, while the alpha alpaca coronavirus caused the spread of respiratory disease in infected animals.
Finally, no cases of the Alpaca alpaca coronavirus have been reported in wild animals.
Therefore, the possibility that alpacas may be infected with the HCoV-229E-related alpha coronavirus from humans cannot be ignored.
In fact, bats are a direct source of human pathogenic viruses, including the herpes virus, Ebola virus, Nepa virus, and the Hendra virus.
It is therefore not surprising that bats may have transmitted HCoV-229E directly to humans.
On the other hand, although the bat alpha coronavirus acts as a genetic reservoir for HCoV-229E, alpacas and mountain-based shrimp can act as intermediate hosts that transmit viruses to humans, as happened with MERS-CoV.
MERS-CoV is an excellent example of interspecies transmission from bats to mountain-based shrimp and more so from mountain-based shrimp to humans.
Early detection of MERS-CoV revealed that bats were the origin of the disease's evolution, and later findings confirmed this.
It is clear that bats are a rich source of viral species for interspecies exchange of genetic fragments and interspecies transmission.
"Long life span, crowded colonies, close social interaction and strong ability to fly are all ideal conditions for bats as ""virus transmitters"".
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has been established in shrimp for decades.
The virus has adapted well to these shuttles, which have evolved from an intermediate host to a stable, natural reservoir host.
MERS-CoV causes very mild disease and the rate of mutation is relatively low in these animals.
Its diffuse transmission to humans is accidental and humans are the closely related hosts of MERS-CoV as transmission between humans cannot continue.
Compared to the role of shterms in the transmission of MERS-CoV, the role of pangolins  if any - in the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is different.
In particular, the pangolin beta viruses in pangolins are highly pathogenic.
They may be the host of the SARS-CoV-2 related alpha-CoVs, similar to SARS-CoV related strains.
Several possibilities for the transcription of SARS-CoV-2 from animals to humans should be confirmed or rejected in future studies.
First, bats can host a SARS-CoV-2-related virus that is almost identical to SARS-CoV-2.
Humans may have a common ecological niche with bats through work in the slaughterhouse or mining.
Second, pangolins can be one of the intermediate replicator hosts that have recently been infected with SARS-CoV-2-related viruses.
Humans are infected with the virus through butchery and hunting meat consumption.
Many mammals, including domestic and domestic animals, may be exposed to SARS-CoV-2.
A study on domestic and wild animals is needed to examine the antibodies.
Third, the above mentioned sequencing and adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 may have occurred in a third species that has been in contact with both bats and pangolins.
The search for the animal origin of SARS-CoV-2 is ongoing.
Along with the different types of animal hosts, there are three main factors of the virus that facilitate cross-species barriers for coronavirus.
First, their relatively high rate of genetic mutation during RNA replication.
"Compared to other single-stranded RNA viruses, depending on the phase of adaptation of the coronavirus to new hosts, the estimated mutation rate for coronavirus based on the approximate average replacement rate of 10  4 replacements per year in place of 2, can be considered ""medium"" to ""high""".
The coronavirus has an unreadable exoribonuclease, and its removal leads to a very long mutation and weakening or even its disappearance.
Interestingly, a nucleotide analogue called remdesivir is known to suppress the process of multiplication of the coronavirus by inhibiting this exoribonuclease and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase.
Remdesivir is one of the best medicines to combat SARS-CoV-2 and should be clinically tested.
However, the mutation rates of coronavirus are almost a million times higher than their hosts.
In addition, the rate of mutation is usually high when the coronavirus has not matched well with the host.
Compared to the high rate of mutation in SARS-CoV, the SARS-CoV-2 mutation rate is significantly lower, indicating a higher level of human matching.
It is likely that it has already matched another host that is related to humans.
In addition to SARS-CoV-2, this is also true for MERS-CoV, which is well adapted to a monsoon shuttle.
Theoretically, it is unlikely that genetic engineering could quickly neutralize vaccines and SARS-CoV-2 antiviruses.
Second, large RNA genomes in coronaviruses cause greater flexibility in genome modification for mutations or neutrophils, resulting in increased probability of interspecies coevolution, which helps to create new coronaviruses when conditions are in place.
This is supported by numerous open and unique reading frames and protein functions encoded toward the 3′ end of the genome.
"Thirdly, coronavirus, through a ""copy-selection"" mechanism, randomly and frequently transform patterns during RNA replication".
In hosts that act as a mixer, strand conversion occurs repeatedly during the transcription of coronavirus RNA.
RNAs with long, complementary length homology and subgenomic can be combined to produce new coronavirus.
Evidence of natural nootropic phylogenetic was found in both HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43 and also in animal viruses such as bat SL-CoV and bat CoV-HKU9.
Interaction between host and virus in relation to transmission
In addition to the three viral factors mentioned above, viral interaction with the host receptor is another key factor affecting interspecies transmission.
Here, the SARS-CoV neutropenia is considered a prominent example and evidence of positive selection during interspecies transmission events has been shown.
Based on a comparative analysis of human and spider SARS-CoV isolates, it is clear that SARS-CoV adapts rapidly to different hosts, especially the mode of mutation in RBD and the S protein.
Generally, RBD in a coronavirus-like S protein interacts with a cellular receptor and is highly selective with a host antibody response.
RBD in SARS-CoV is found in the amino acids 318 to 510 on the S1 segment, which causes human ACE2 binding as well as common receptors for entry of the virus.
The connective tissue of the SARS-CoV receptor is capable of detecting ACE2 receptors in various animals including bats, bats, mice and raccoons, which makes it possible to transmit the virus interspecies.
In fact, only the remaining 6 amino acids were observed to have RBDs that differed between viruses isolated from humans and fungi, and 4 of them were in the receptor binding motif for reactivity with ACE2 receptors.
SARS-CoV has two mutations, K479N and S487T, in its RBD, which may increase the dependency of the spike protein interaction with human ACE2 receptors.
In other words, these two amino acid substitutes can play a vital role in viral adaptation to humans.
It is worth noting that the SARS-CoV-2 cell receptor is the same as SARS-CoV.
A 30 percent difference between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV in the S1 unit of S protein suggests that the tendency to bind its S protein to human ACE2 is likely to have evolved.
In fact, a cryo-EM study showed 10-20 times longer affinity of this link compared to the link between the ACE2 and S proteins belonging to SARS-CoV.
It will also be interesting to determine which other auxiliary receptors are needed for transmission compared to the high rate of mutation in SARS-CoV-2.
Interestingly, HCoV-NL63 is also linked to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), but with a different section of S.
There are many other human coronavirus receptors, including the amino-peptide N for HCoV-229E and the 9-O-stelic acid for HCoV-OC43.
This could be the reason for the successful adaptation of these coronaviruses in humans after interspecies transmission from the host animal.
In addition to cellular receptors, the resulting interspecies transmission of human coronavirus is affected by other dependencies on hosts and limiting factors.
The interbreeding of these host proteins between humans and hosts of the natural reservoir of human coronavirus such as bats, mountain-shatter and rodents can form a barrier to interspecies transmission.
For a successful interspecies transmission, human coronaviruses must take on host dependence factors and suppress host limiting factors.
In this regard, molecular determinants in this important area of virus-host interaction must be identified and identified.
Neutral screening across the genome of host dependencies and limiting factors for SARS-CoV-2 may be beneficial using advanced CRISPR technology.
New human coronavirus emerges: return to zero
The diversity of bats' coronaviruses provides ample opportunities for the emergence of new human coronaviruses.
Based on this, bat coronaviruses act as the genetic source of human coronaviruses.
In addition, rapid and nootropic genetic mutations also cause human coronavirus to develop and act as two important steps in the process.
For example, the acquisition or loss of new protein-coding genes could potentially significantly modify viral phenotypes.
Among SARS-CoV side proteins, ORF8 appears to be important in human adaptation, as SARS-CoV-related bat viruses have been isolated, but it has been found that ORF8 proteins encode the vagrants.
A specific removal of the 29-nucleotide SARS-CoVs in isolated species was found at the beginning of the human epidemic.
This removal divides ORF8 into ORF8a and ORF8b, and is a type of adaptive mutation that facilitates the movement between hosts.
In addition, SARS-CoV likely had a nootropic history between alpha and coronavirus strains, on the basis of which a large number of smaller nootropic sections in RNA polymerase-dependent RNA were identified.
The positions of the notrkyb were also identified in nsp9, the major part of nsp10, and the components of nsp14.
Similarly, it was found that in the MERS-CoV epidemic, there were occurrences of interlinear sequences that occurred in the shuttles of a mountain in Saudi Arabia.
In addition to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, nootropic events have also been observed in other human coronaviruses where human coronaviruses are nootropic with other animal coronaviruses in their nonstructural genes.
It should also be noted that artificial selection can play a role in the creation of unwanted mutations in viral genomes, which are most likely the result of viruses being released from selective pressures, for example by the host's immune system.
An example of these effects is the loss of full length ORF4 in the HCoV-229E prototype strand due to the removal of two nucleotides.
Although healthy ORF4 can be seen in HCoV-229E-related bats and shterviruses, the alpha-alpha-alpha-virus has a nucleotide gradient that leads to a reading frame-conversion mutation.
Recently, the evolution of emerging human coronavirus is also under pressure to select their storage hosts.
When bats became infected with the coronavirus, cases were identified as either unsigned or mildly symptomatic, indicating a bilateral match between the coronavirus and bats.
This shows that bats adapted well to the coronavirus, both anatomically and physiologically.
For example, a deficiency in activating the primary inflammatory response in bats reduces the effectiveness of pathology activated with coronaviruses.
In addition, the activity of natural killer cells in bats is suppressed due to the increased production of NKG2/CD94 inhibitor natural killer cell receptors and the low expression level of the core class one tissue adaptive complex molecules.
In addition, high levels of active oxygen-containing compounds (ROS) from high metabolic activity in bats can simultaneously suppress the proliferation of the coronavirus and affect the upper test specimen exoribonuclease, resulting in selective pressure to produce strains of the virus that have high pathogens when introduced to a new host.
Stereotypes of the coronavirus with higher pathogenic properties also evolve with neutropenia, leading to the acquisition of new proteins or protein properties for host compatibility.
So, it is no coincidence that three new human coronavirus have emerged in the past two decades.
Coronavirus are not pathogens or cause very mild symptoms in their host host, such as bats and shrimp.
They multiply exponentially without creating a strong immune response from the host.
There is some confusion as to why unmarked vectors are seen and what causes severe human infections.
Severe symptoms are usually due to over-activation of the immune system response and cytokine storms, where the stronger the immune response, the more severe the lung damage will be.
In contrast, in unsigned carriers, the immune response to coronavirus replication is isolated.
The same strategy for isolating the immune response may have positive effects in the treatment of SARS-CoV-2.
The interferon response in bats is particularly strong.
Therefore, use of type I interferon should be beneficial in humans at least in the early stages of SARS-CoV-2 infection.
In addition, the activation of NLRP3 inflammatory factor in bats is defective.
With this logic, inhibiting NLRP3 inflammation with MCC950 can be useful in the treatment of COVID-19.
The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 follows the general pattern that created SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Although beta-coronavirus has a 95% nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV, there is a bat coronavirus with a 96% nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV-2.
While scabies and other animals on the market are known to host SARS-CoV-like viruses, the first SARS-CoV-2 intermediate host is not known.
The discovered pangolin beta viruses, which are surprisingly homologous to SARS-CoV-2, suggest that pangolins may have acted as one of the intermediate hosts or that the pangolin beta coronavirus may have played a role in the pieces of the gene that made the final version of SARS-CoV-2.
Although the question remains, there is no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 was deliberately or accidentally created by humans.
Coronavirus has re-opened to the public due to the recent widespread outbreak of SARS-CoV-2.
The study of coronavirus in bats and other animals has significantly changed our understanding of the importance of animal origin and the human coronavirus repository for human transmission to humans.
Convincing evidence has shown that SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 originated in bats and were transmitted to humans through intermediate hosts.
Given that SARS-CoV infection originated from human-to-insect contact on the market, closing the fertilizer markets and killing the insects could effectively end the SARS epidemic.
With the same logic, given the discovery that several strains of the pangolin betavirus are closely related to SARS-CoV-2, pangolins should be collected from farmers' markets to prevent animal transmission.
However, whether SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted to humans through pangolins and other animals or through yeast and its mechanisms will be determined in future research.
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has been present in mountain shrimp for a long time.
These shuttles are an important means of transportation and also a major source of meat, milk, leather and dairy products for the local population.
They are widespread in the Middle East and Africa.
So sacrificing all shuttles for MERS control, similar to what happened to control the outbreak of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 in relation to Chinese market wildlife, is virtually impossible.
To stop the recurrence of MERS, a comprehensive approach to developing effective vaccines to combat MERS-CoV in camels and all necessary measures to control infection were required.
Since we cannot eliminate these viruses, new genotypes may emerge and cause outbreaks.
Several types of animal coronavirus are circulating in the wild.
In particular, bat coronavirus is highly diverse and can be transmitted from animals to humans.
There are many opportunities for these animal coronaviruses to evolve or become neutrophils, leading to the emergence of new coronaviruses that will be more transmissible and/or lethal to humans in the future.
The culture of wildlife eating in some parts of China must be forgotten to reduce unnecessary contact between humans and animals.
Given the disasters caused by SARS, MERS and COVID-19, a better preparedness and response plan should be developed.
In fact, many viruses have been around for a long time.
They remain in their natural reserves until an opportunity arises.
Although bats have many characteristics that contribute to the spread of viruses, the likelihood of human contact with bats and other wildlife can be minimized if people are trained to stay away from these animals.
Continuous monitoring of mammals is essential to better understand the ecology of coronavirus and their natural hosts, which will be helpful in preventing their transmission from animals to humans and their future outbreaks.
In conclusion, the most effective way to prevent transmission of the virus from animals to humans is to keep humans away from the natural reservoirs of viruses transmitted from animals to humans.
Several pieces of the animal origin puzzle SARS-CoV-2 have been lost since.
First, if bats transmit an ancestral SARS-CoV-2 virus to pangolins, it will be interesting to see under what conditions bats and pangolins can share a common ecological niche.
Second, if bats play a direct role in transmitting to humans, the manner in which humans communicate with bats should be determined.
Third, if a third mammal acts as a true intermediate host, the way it interacts with different species including humans, bats, and pangolins must be determined.
Finally, as many mammals, including domestic animals, may be exposed to SARS-CoV-2, surveillance and experimental infection should be carried out.
Whether it is in a bat, a pangolin or any other mammal, SARS-CoV-2 or its parent viruses that are almost identical are expected to be found in their natural hosts in the future.
Ongoing research in this area will shed light on the evolutionary pathway of SARS-CoV-2 in animals, along with important insights into the prevention and control of COVID-19 in humans.
"It is essential to clarify the criteria for COVID-19 diagnosis for "suspicious" and "confirmed" information".
On February 6, 2020, our team published a quick guide to the diagnosis and treatment of the 2019 new coronavirus (2019-nCoV) infection, which provided our experience and provides a good reference for the global pandemic.
However, the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is a new disease, and our awareness and knowledge is increasing gradually based on the findings of ongoing research and clinical practice experience. Therefore, diagnostic and treatment strategies are also constantly being updated.
In this letter, we responded to a unanimous opinion regarding our guideline and presented the latest diagnostic criteria for suspected and confirmed cases in accordance with the latest COVID-19 Diagnosis and Treatment Guidelines (seventh edition) issued by the National Health Committee of the People's Republic of China.
In December 2019, the new coronavirus 2019 (2019-nCoV) led to an outbreak of a pandemic disease that is now officially known as the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) and the virus as the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus.
On 11 March 2020, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 as a pandemic disease.
To combat SARS-CoV-2, our team has developed a quick recommendation guide published online in Military Medical Research on February 6, 2020.
This has attracted much attention since its publication.
Please note that COVID-19 is a new disease, and our awareness and knowledge is increasing gradually based on ongoing research findings and clinical experiences. Therefore, diagnostic and treatment strategies are also constantly being updated.
For example, the COVID-19 diagnostic and treatment procedures issued by the National Health Committee of the People's Republic of China (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/), published in total in seven editions between 16 January 2020 and 3 March 2020, have made some of the provisions fundamental.
Now that our guidelines have been received from Zhou and colleagues, they have made a simple suggestion for scoring based on their clinical experience.
Their work added new evidence to our guide and continues to be a valuable reference to the pandemic around the world.
We acknowledge their remarkable efforts and express our concerns.
However, their work also needs to be updated due to the latest COVID-19 diagnosis and treatment procedures (seventh trial version) and recent studies.
According to the Seventh Amendment (March 3, 2020), for confirmation of a suspected case, each of the epidemiological history features must be combined with two clinical signs to allow for a comprehensive analysis, or in the absence of an epidemiological history, three clinical signs must be present:
Epidemiological history: (1) A history of travel or residence in Wuhan and surrounding areas or other communities where COVID-19 cases have been reported in the last 14 days prior to the onset of symptoms; (2) a history of contact with SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals (with a positive nucleic acid test); (3) a history of contact with patients with fever or respiratory symptoms from Wuhan and surrounding areas or other communities where COVID-19 has been reported in the last 14 days prior to the onset of symptoms; (4) a history of contact with a cluster of confirmed cases (2 cases of fever and/or respiratory symptoms occurred within 2 weeks in small areas such as home, workplace, classroom, school, etc.).
Clinical signs: (1) Fever and/or respiratory symptoms. (2) Have imaging characteristics of COVID-19 infection; (3) Total white blood cell counts, at an early stage in the classification of normal, decreased, or decreased lymphocytes.
The confirmed diagnosis must be based on a suspicious case with one of the following pathogenic or serological cases: (1) real-time PCR testing is positive for SARS-CoV-2; (2) the overall viral genome sequence is highly homogeneous with the new coronavirus; (3) the result is positive for a specific IgM antibody and IgG antibody to SARS-CoV-2 in serum testing; or the conversion of SARS-CoV-2 assigned IgG antibody from negative to positive or an increase in the titer 4 times or more in the recovery phase over such a long period in the acute phase.
We can see that the instant PCR test for nucleic acid in the respiratory system or blood sample has been added to the second (January 18, 2020) and third (January 22, 2020) versions.
Pathogenic diagnosis of blood samples was added to the fourth (27 January 2020) and fifth (8 February 2020) versions; and then serological evidence was added to the seventh version.
These improvements are based on researchers' continued efforts to find an optimal nucleic acid diagnostic kit for rapid diagnosis, as well as samples of the respiratory system including blood sampling, which led to the discovery of validated criteria with increased availability of different samples and increased support for relying on a positive antibody result.
Moreover, there is increasing evidence that we should treat patients with abnormal or symptomless symptoms with caution.
Therefore, the flow chart of Zoo and colleagues should be approximated, as they classified individuals without clinical symptoms as low-risk.
The scoring system should also be further validated in clinical studies and measures.
In conclusion, we hope that more direct evidence is available and we ask readers to comment.
To identify suspect and confirmed cases, we suggest that you follow and follow the latest country guidelines.
Our team will also provide timely guidance on how to provide assistance.
Bangladesh reported five new deaths from COVID-19, the highest number in a single day.
Yesterday, Bangladesh declared five footage in a day due to COVID-19.
This is the highest number of deaths from the virus in a single day.
Yesterday, the Bangladesh Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research (IEDCR) reported 114 cases of infection and 33 cases of supplemental recovery in the home.
A total of 17 deaths have been recorded.
In an online news report, IEDCR Director, Dr. Merzadi Sabrina Flora, said the deaths were four men and one woman.
According to Dr. Merzadi, two were over 60, two were between 51 and 60 years of age and one was between 41 and 50 years of age.
He also said that two of the victims were from Dhaka.
The World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a global pandemic on March 11.
A hospital official told a local news agency, Anadolu Agency, that one of the flaws was Jalal Sifur Rahman, the head of the Bangladesh Anti-Corruption Commission, who was being treated at Kuwait's Maitreya Hospital.
Abid Al-Qadir, Bangladesh's Minister of Road Transport and Bridges, said in an online video statement on Saturday that domestic transport will be on holiday longer than originally planned, i.e. until next Saturday.
The civil transportation leave scheme started on 26 March and was due to expire on Saturday 4 April.
Transportation of essential goods - medical, fuel and food - was still permitted.
The first case of COVID-19 in Bangladesh was reported on March 8, involving two people returning from Italy and the wife of one of the two was also infected.
On March 19, the three were healed.
The number of cases of SARS-CoV-2 has exceeded one million worldwide
On Thursday, the number of SARS-CoV-2 cases worldwide exceeded one million, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.
At least 52,000 deaths have been linked to COVID-19, a disease caused by coronavirus.
The milestone was the day Malawi announced its first coronavirus case and Zambia reported its first case of the virus.
North Korea on Thursday claimed to be one of the few countries to remain free of coronavirus infections.
Yesterday, the World Health Organization reported 105,1635 confirmed cases, including 7,9332 cases in the twenty-four hours before 10:00 a.m. Central European Time (0800 UTC) on April 4.
In the United States, more than 244,000 cases of coronavirus have been reported, resulting in at least 5,900 deaths.
CBC News reported citing data from Johns Hopkins University, that more than 1,000 people died of coronavirus infection in the United States on Wednesday.
Around the world, countries are taking specific measures to prevent the spread of the virus.
On Thursday, Sergei Sobyanin Sharwal of Moscow extended the city's leave to 1.
At the country level, President Vladimir Putin announced that Russians would be paid without working until April 30.
The Portuguese parliament voted to extend the state of emergency by 15 days, with 215 votes in favour, 10 abstentions and one vote against.
Saudi Arabia has declared a curfew in the holy cities of Mecca and Medina for the entire day; previously, curfew was only in effect between 3 p.m. and 6 a.m.
Thailand is scheduled to impose a curfew between 10 p.m. and 4 a.m.
Ohio Governor Mike DeWine announced that the government has extended the stay-at-home order for another month.
Shops in Australia have lowered the sales limit for toiletries per transaction.
On Sunday and Saturday evening, Australian chain stores Walworth and Coles reduced their paper towel purchase shares to two and one pack for each purchase in all stores in the country, respectively.
ALDI announced a purchase limit on Monday for only one package.
These restrictions were posted as messages on the payment box and Facebook pages of stores.
It has been reported that buyers who are afraid of COVID-19 and their own abstraction are stockpiling soda.
On Wednesday, Woolworths also limited the purchase of toilet towels for door delivery to one package per order.
The conversions followed four previous packages for each transaction restriction introduced on March 4 and 5, respectively, by Woolworths and Coles.
Coles supermarkets reported in a media interview on March 8 that despite the four-package restriction, ""many stores will reach full sales within an hour of delivery of goods"" and called the demand ""unprecedented"", while stores in ALDI chains, in their Facebook post on Tuesday, called the sale ""unexpected"".
"According to a Wallworth spokesperson, sales rose with a ""sharp swing""".
The Costco store in Canberra also limited the allowable amount to two packages a week ago.
To reduce this shortage, Coles ordered larger packages to suppliers and increased frequency of delivery, Walworth ordered additional stock and Aldi pre-stocked for a special offer on Wednesday.
Rachel Zimmerman, Executive Director of the Australian Retail Union, said retailers were trying to increase inventory, but local authorities' restrictions on the timing of lorries made the work harder.
He expects production costs to rise, as suppliers try to meet demand and have fewer specials.
On Tuesday, ALDI (chain sales department) announced that due to early release of shares, some stores will not be able to hold Wednesday's special sale.
In a News.com.au report, retail business expert Dr Gary Mortimer of Queensland University of Technology said stores were filling up their stores every night.
He noted that toilet towels are a bulky item that takes up a small amount of space in a large amount of space. If sold, the large space empties the shelves and causes a feeling of shortage.
"Rachel Zimmerman told ABC News that ""Coles and Wallworth believe that if there were enough goods on the shelves, if there were enough products available and available, such as toilet towels and disinfectants, you could probably minimize this buying fear"."
A recycled toilet towel manufacturer, Who Gives a Crap, said on Wednesday that it had finished its inventory.
According to News.com.au, Kimberly-Clark, manufacturer of Clinics toilet towels, and Solaris Paper, manufacturer of Sorbent, stressed that they work 24 hours a day, seven days a week to meet market demand.
Domain.com, a real estate company, reported that when buyers are on holiday due to a long working day off and fewer auctions are held, some property sellers offer free toiletries to the first bidder at the Melbourne auctions.
The Thursday edition of NT News, a newspaper published in Darwin, included an eight-page appendix intended for use as a toilet towel.
According to ABC Australia's March 3 report, stores initially were unwilling to impose restrictions and stated that they had no plans to impose purchase restrictions.
Russell Zimmerman added: "Other products such as masks, disinfectants, dryers, powders and handwashing fluids are in high demand.
Similarly, outside Australia, it was observed that on Sunday evening the British online supermarket Okadu limited the purchase of toilet towels to two 12-pack.
World Health Organization announces the COVID-19 pandemic
On Wednesday, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the ongoing outbreak of COVID-19 caused by the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.
"Although the word ""pandemic"" refers only to the extent to which the disease has spread and has no indication of the danger of specific cases, the World Health Organization has pointed out the need to encourage governments to:
"All countries can change the course of the pandemic".
Tedros Adhanom, head of the World Health Organization believes that "when countries react to the diagnosis, testing, treatment, abstraction, tracking and mobilization of people, they will react".
""We are deeply concerned about the alarming levels of outbreaks and severity of the disease, as well as the alarming levels of inaction"."
"According to Dr. Tom Friedman, former director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the pandemic was ""unprecedented""".
"In statements published by CNN in February, he said, ""except for influenza, no other respiratory virus has been identified from the onset of symptoms to the ongoing global outbreak"."
Ghebreyesus made a similar comment, saying: "We have never seen a pandemic caused by coronavirus before.
"He continued, ""We have never seen a pandemic that could be controlled simultaneously"."
The new status as a pandemic disease follows the decision of the World Health Organization, which in January declared the outbreak to be an international public health emergency.
Dr. Anthony Fosse, director of the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said of the outbreak, ""In general, things are getting worse"".
As of Thursday, the Associated Press reported that there were at least 126,000 COVID-19 cases worldwide, resulting in more than 4,600 deaths.
The 2020-2019 coronavirus pandemic is a continuing pandemic of the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) caused by the acute chronic respiratory syndrome of coronavirus 2 (SARS-COVID-2).
The outbreak was first identified in December 2019 in Wuhan, China, declared a national public health emergency of concern on 30 January 2020 and declared a pandemic disease on 11 March 2020.
As of 10 April 2020, approximately 1.61 million COVID-19 cases have been reported in 210 countries and regions, causing nearly 97,000 deaths.
About 364,000 people have recovered.
The mortality rate in China was estimated at 4%, however, globally, it varies from 13.4% in Algeria to 0.08% in New Zealand.
Common symptoms include fever, cough, and shortness of breath.
The complications include pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome.
It usually takes about 5 days from exposure to the virus to the onset of symptoms, but may vary from two to fourteen days.
There is no specific vaccine or antiviral treatment for the disease.
Primary treatment is actually a form of symptom treatment and a supportive treatment. Recommended preventive measures include hand washing, mouth covering when coughing, keeping distance from others, and checking and quarantining suspected infected individuals.
Authorities around the world have responded to travel restrictions, quarantine, movement restrictions, workplace hazard control and facility leave.
The pandemic has led to severe global socioeconomic disruption, postponement or cancellation of sporting, religious, political and cultural events, and widespread resource shortages caused by panic attacks.
Schools and universities in 193 countries have been closed nationally or locally, affecting almost 99.4% of the world's student population.
False information about the virus has been posted online, and cases of foreign terrorism and discrimination against Chinese, other ethnic and ethnic minorities from East and Southeast Asia and other regions have been reported.
Due to reduced travel and heavy industry holidays, air pollution and carbon emissions have decreased.
Health officials in Wuhan, China (capital of Hubei Province), reported cases of pneumonia with an unknown cause on December 31, 2019, and an investigation began in early January 2020.
The patients were mainly associated with the wholesale market of Hunan seafood products, so it is assumed that the virus originated in the zoonosis (a common human-animal disease).
The virus that caused the outbreak, known as SARS-CoV-2, is a newly discovered virus with features very similar to the bat coronavirus, the pangolin coronavirus and SARS-CoV. It was later revealed that the first person to show symptoms was infected on 1 December 2019 and that person had no clear contact with the seafood market cluster.
The initial group of reported cases in December 2019 revealed that two-thirds of the cases were market-related.
On March 13, 2020, an unconfirmed report from the South China Morning Post suggested that an incident discovered on November 17, 2019 in a 55-year-old person in Hubei Province may be the first infectious event. On February 26, 2020, WHO reported that as new cases in China, Italy, Iran and South Korea declined, infectious cases have increased abruptly, with the number of new cases outside China exceeding the number of new cases in China for the first time.
Important reports may not be reported as a supplement, especially in cases with milder symptoms.
As of 26 February, relatively few cases of the disease were reported among people of all ages, with only 2.4% of all cases worldwide being those aged 19 and under. Patrick Wallans, Senior Scientific Adviser to the UK Government, estimated that 60% of the UK population would be infected with the virus if a collective immunity was to be achieved.
Cases are related to the population tested for COVID-19 and their testing has been confirmed and declared positive in accordance with official protocols.
As of March 23, no country has tested more than 3% of its population and the official policy of many countries, including Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland, has been to refrain from testing for people with mild symptoms.
A study published on March 16 showed that in China, as of January 23, about 86% of COVID-19 infections were undetected and these undocumented infections were the source of infection for 79% of the cases.
A statistical analysis published on 30 March estimated that the number of infections reported in Italy was significantly higher than the number of cases.
Initial estimates of the base replication rate (R0) for COVID-19 were 1.4 to 2.4 cases.
A study published by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention declared it 5.7.
Most people with COVID-19 recover.
For those who do not, the time period of onset of symptoms to death varies between 6 and 41 days, with the most common being 14 days.
As of 10 April 2020, approximately 97,000 deaths have been attributed to COVID-19.
In China, as of February 5, about 80% of deaths occurred in people over 60 years of age, and 75% of them had previous underlying medical conditions, including cardiovascular disease and diabetes. Official deaths from the COVID-19 pandemic have generally been in people who have tested positive for COVID-19 in accordance with official protocols.
The actual number of COVID-19 deaths is much higher because it does not include those who die without testing, for example at home or in hospice facilities.
Preliminary data from Italy showed that the number of deaths from the pandemic was 5-4 times the official declared number of deaths from COVID.
"A spokesperson for the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) acknowledged that ""we know [the death toll] is less than the actual figure"".Reported reports of unrealistic numbers in the United States confirm these statements. This is a lower estimate than in fact, often occurring in pandemics such as the H1N1 swine flu epidemic. The first confirmed death was reported on January 9, 2020 in Wuhan".
The first death outside mainland China occurred on February 1 in the Philippines and the first death outside mainland Asia on February 14 in France.
As of February 28, more than a dozen cases of footage were reported outside mainland China in Iran, South Korea and Italy.
As of March 13, deaths had been reported in more than forty countries and territories, on all continents except the South Pole. Other scales are used to determine the number of deaths.
These numbers vary in different regions and times, and are influenced by factors such as the number of tests performed, the quality of the treatment system, treatment options, the length of time since the initial outbreak and demographic characteristics such as age, gender and public health.
According to Johns Hopkins University statistics, as of April 10, 2020, the global mortality-to-incidence ratio was 6% (97,039 out of 161,7204).
The figures vary by region.
In China, the estimated mortality rate decreased from 17.3% (individuals with symptom onset for January 1 to 10, 2020) to 0.7% (for individuals with symptom onset after February 1, 2020). The remaining calculations include: the mortality rate of disease (CFR) which represents the percentage of people diagnosed dying from a disease and the mortality rate of infection (IFR IFR) which represents the percentage of people infected (diagnosed and undiagnosed) who die from a disease.
These statistics have no time limit and depend on a particular community from infection to recovery.
A number of university researchers have attempted to calculate this figure for a particular population.
The Centre for Applied Medicine at Oxford University estimates that the overall mortality rate for the global pandemic is between 0.1% and 0.39%.
The estimates above this range are consistent with the results of randomized COVID-19 testing in Germany and the statistical study analysing the impact of this test on CFR estimates.
The World Health Organization recognizes that a global pandemic can be controlled.
The peak of outbreaks and the final duration of their outbreaks are unknown and may vary depending on the location.
Maciej Boni of Penn State University admitted: If the outbreak is not investigated, it typically remains unconverted for some time and decreases after the end of existing hosts.
"But at present, any reasonable prediction regarding the time of the end of the disease is almost impossible".
Chinese government's top medical adviser, Zhong Nanshang, said that if all countries can mobilize everyone to comply with WHO recommendations on measures to stop the spread of the virus, "it could be completed by June".
On 17 March, Adam Kucharski of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine said SARS-CoV-2 was "spreading and likely to remain for a year or two".
"According to a study by Imperial College led by Neil Ferguson, physical distancing and other measures will be necessary"" until the vaccine becomes available (about 18 months or more)".
William Schaffner of the University of Windsor said, ""I believe the virus is unlikely to disappear in a complementary manner - as it is highly contagious"" and ""it could become a seasonal disease that re-emerges every year"".
The severity of the re-infection depends on the immunity of the cattle to disease and the extent of their mutation.
Symptoms of COVID-19 can be relatively uncommon and infected people may be symptomless.
The two most common symptoms are fever (88%) and dry sputum (68%).
Symptoms with less prevalence include fatigue, respiratory obstruction (diarrhea), loss of sense of smell, tight breathing, muscle and joint pain, throat pain, headache, tremors, vomiting, hemorrhaging, diarrhea or cyanosis.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) defines emergency symptoms as respiratory distress, persistent chest pain or feeling pressured, sudden confusion, difficulty waking up and bruising of the face or lips; if these symptoms are present, immediate medical treatment is recommended. Further progression of the disease can lead to severe chest and wrist, acute respiratory syndrome, sinusitis, septic shock, and death.
Some infected individuals may be symptomless and have no clinical symptoms, but the results of tests confirm their infection, so researchers recommend that people who have close contact with these cases be carefully monitored and examined to prevent the spread of infection.
The proportion of symptomless patients in China was estimated at up to 44%.
The incubation period (the time between infection and onset of symptoms) usually varies from one to fourteen days; in the majority of cases, it is five days. An example of uncertainty is the estimated decrease in COVID-19 patients who have lost their sense of smell by 30% initially and later to 15%.
Some details about the outbreak have been revealed recently.
It is believed that in the early stages, the virus outbreak is caused by close contact with small droplets that occur when coughing, thirsting, or talking, if close contact is considered to be between 1 and 2 metres (3 to 6 ft).
Studies have shown that when surfing without a cover, droplets can be moved from 4.5 metres (15 ft) to 8.2 metres (27 ft).
Some have suggested that the virus may also be transmitted by tiny liquid droplets that are released when speaking and remain suspended in air for longer. Breathing droplets may also be transmitted when breathing and when speaking, although the virus is not normally released by air.
These droplets may enter the mouth or nose of people close to us and be absorbed into the lungs.
Some medical procedures such as tubing and pulmonary resuscitation (CPR) may cause respiratory filtration to spread through the air, resulting in air discharge.
If you touch a contaminated surface such as the skin and then touch your eyes, nose and mouth, the disease may spread.
While there are concerns about the spread of the strain of the virus, the risk is not very serious.
The Chinese government has denied the possibility of femoral transmission of SARS-CoV-2. The virus is most contagious in the first three days after the onset of symptoms, although it may spread to others before symptoms begin and in the final stages of the disease.
The test results were positive up to three days before the onset of symptoms, indicating that transmission takes place before significant symptoms occur.
There are only a few reports of lab-approved unmarked cases, but unmarked transmission has been identified by some countries during investigations into contact tracing.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) says that although it is not clear how easily the disease spreads in a complementary way, an infected person can usually infect two to three other people.
In particular, the virus has been detectable on plastic (polypropylene) and stainless steel 304 for more than three days, on a case for one day, and on copper for more than four hours.
However, this is based on humidity and temperature. The COVID-19 test on pets and other animals has been positive.
There is no conclusive evidence that animals can transmit the virus to humans, although UK authorities recommend that you wash your hands after contact with animals, just as you do when touching other contaminated surfaces.
Coronavirus 2 is a novel respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2) that was first identified in three people with breast and knee injuries in Wuhan who suffered from blood oxygen loss and respiratory problems.
All of the new coronavirus features are present in other natural coronavirus. Outside the human body, the virus is killed with ordinary soap, as its protective layer is dissolved in soap. SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to SARS-CoV.
The disease is thought to have a zoonotic origin or a disease common to humans and livestock.
Genetic analysis has shown that the coronavirus is genetically related to Betacoronavirus and to the subgenus Sarbecovirus (Domain B) together with two strains of bat origin forming a cluster.
The virus has a 96% overall genome-wide similarity to other bat coronavirus specimens (BatCov RaTG13).
In February 2020, Chinese researchers discovered that in certain parts of the genome sequence, there is only one amino acid difference between pangolin viruses and human viruses.
Compared to the total genome to date, 92% of the genetic material shared between the coronavirus is Pangolin and SARS-CoV-2, which is not sufficient to prove pangolin as an intermediate host.
Viral infection can be diagnosed temporarily based on symptoms, although a definite detection of the reverse polymerase transcription chain reaction (Rrt-PCR) agent of infected or CT imaging is confirmed.
A study comparing the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with CT scans (CT) in Wuhan showed that CT is more sensitive to PCR, although less specialized and has many of its imaging characteristics overlapping with other types of breast and wrist disease processes.
"From March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommended that ""CTs should not be used for screening or testing of COVID-19 pre-diagnosis"."
The World Health Organization has published several RNA testing protocols for SARS-CoV-2, the first of which was on January 17.
The test uses a reverse transcriptional polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR).
The test can be performed on breathing or blood samples.
Results are typically presented within a few hours to a few days.
Generally, this test is performed with a biological antibody, although a gluon substrate may also be used. A number of laboratories and companies are producing serological tests that detect antibodies.
As of April 6, 2020, none of these were sufficiently accurate for wide use.
In the United States, a serological test designed by Cellex has been approved for emergency use only by authorized laboratories.
The distinctive imaging characteristics in radiological and computed tomography (CT) images of people with symptoms included rounded glass chromosomes and no lateral effusions were observed.
The Italian Radiological Society is collecting an online database of imaging findings of confirmed cases.
Because of the synchronicity with other infections such as adenoviruses, imaging without final PCR confirmation is limited in the diagnosis of COVID-19.
A large study in China compared the results of chest CT with PCR and found that although imaging is less used for the infection, it is sensitive and fast and can be used as a screening tool in epidemic areas.
Complex AI-based neural networks were developed to detect viral imaging characteristics in radiology and CT images.
Strategies for preventing transmission include maintaining general personal hygiene, washing hands, not touching eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands, and coughing or sneezing in towels and quickly throwing towels in garbage cans.
Those who may have previously been infected are advised to wear a surgical mask in public.
Physical distancing is also recommended to prevent transmission. Many governments have restricted all non-essential travel to countries and regions affected by the outbreak.
However, in large parts of the world, the virus has reached a social stage.
This means that the virus is spreading between communities and some members of the community do not know where or how they became infected. Care providers who may be caring for an infected person are advised to take preventive measures, exercise caution when contacting and use eye protection. Tracking contact records of an infected person is an important method used by health authorities to determine the source of infection and prevent further spread.
The use of location data from mobile phones by governments has raised concerns about privacy, a claim that Amnesty International, along with more than 100 other organizations, issued a statement calling for restrictions on such surveillance measures.
Multiple mobile phone applications have been deployed or offered for voluntary use, and as of April 7, 2020, more than a dozen expert groups are working on privacy-friendly solutions such as using Bluetooth to access mobile phones with nearby users.
Users will then receive a message asking if they have recently been in direct contact with a person who has tested positive for COVID-19. Misconceptions about how to prevent infection have become common; for example, nasal washing and mouthwashing are not effective.
There is no vaccine for COVID-19, however, various organizations are working to achieve it.
Hand washing is recommended to prevent the spread of the disease.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that people wash their hands with soap and water for at least twenty seconds, especially after going to the bathroom or when their hands are clearly dirty; before eating; after finishing, coughing or thirst.
Because the virus is killed outside the human body with ordinary soap, soap removes its protective coating.
The CDC also recommends using alcohol-based hand sanitizers with at least 60% alcohol if there is no access to water and soap.
The World Health Organization recommends that people refrain from touching their eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands.
The levels can be disinfected with a number of solutions (one minute of exposure to antimicrobials for stainless steel levels), including 62-71% ethanol, 50-100% isopropanol, 0.1% sodium hypochlorite, 0.5% hydrogen peroxide, and 0.2%-7.5% powydone iodine.
Other solutions such as benzalkonium chloride and chloride gluconate have less effect.
According to the CDC recommendation, if a person is suspected of COVID or has been confirmed at a location such as an office or a treatment center, all areas such as offices, health services, radiation areas, common electronic equipment such as tablets, touch screens, keypads, remote controls and ATM machines used by patients should be contaminated.
Health organizations have advised people to take their towels or bracelets before their mouths and noses when coughing or sneezing and immediately throw away their paper towels.
Surgical masks are recommended for people who may have been infected, as masks can reduce the volume and distance of breathing droplets when speaking, thirst and coughing.
The World Health Organization has issued guidelines on when and how to wear masks.
According to Stephen Griffin, a virologist at the University of Leeds, ""wearing a mask can reduce people's tendency to touch their face when they are sitting with their hands, which is the main driver of infection transmission"."Masks are also recommended for people who are caring for suspected cases of the disease".
The World Health Organization has recommended that healthy people only wear masks when they are at high risk, for example, taking care of people with COVID-19, although it confirms that wearing a mask may help people not touch their face.
Several countries have begun encouraging the public to wear face masks.
In the United States, the CDC recommends the use of non-medical facial masks made of fabric. China recommends the use of medical masks once for community health, especially in close contact with others of 1 meter (3 feet or less).
Hong Kong recommends the use of surgical masks in public transportation or in crowded places.
Thai health officials are encouraging people to produce fabric face masks at home and wash their yomies.
The Czech Republic has declared that it is forbidden to go to public places without wearing a mask or covering the nose and mouth.
On March 16, Vietnam urged everyone to wear a mask to protect themselves and others when they are in public places.
The Austrian government made wearing a mask mandatory for those entering a grocery store.
Israel has asked all citizens to wear masks when attending public places.
Taiwan, which has reached a production capacity of ten million masks per day since mid-March, has made wearing masks mandatory for passengers of railway fleets and intercity buses from April 1.
In Panama, wearing a face mask is mandatory when going out and those who cannot get a face mask must produce a face mask at home.
Face masks were widely used in Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, and Singapore.
Social distancing (also known as physical distancing) includes infection control measures that are implemented to reduce disease by minimizing contact between individuals.
Methods include quarantine; travel restrictions; and school holidays, workplaces, sports stadiums, theaters, or shopping malls.
People can maintain social distancing by staying at home, restricting travel, avoiding crowded areas, using non-contact ballots, and keeping their distance from others.
Many governments have already mandated or recommended social distancing in quarantined areas affected by outbreaks.
The maximum population in communities recommended by government agencies and health agencies in the United States of America declined rapidly from 250 (if there were no cases of COVID-19 outbreaks in the region) to 50 and then to 10.
"From March 22, 2020, Germany has banned more than two people from participating in social gatherings. People with disabilities and people with medical conditions such as diabetes, heart disease, respiratory disease, hypertension and immune system weakness are at high risk for these acute illnesses and their complications, and according to the CDC recommendation, they should stay at home in areas of population spread as much as possible. In late March 2020, the World Health Organization and other health organizations changed the term ""social distancing"" to ""physical distancing"" to indicate that the goal is to reduce physical contact while maintaining virtual or remote social communications".
"The use of the term ""social distancing"" has given rise to the notion that people should participate in complementary social abstraction rather than encouraging them to interact with others through alternative means. Some authorities have issued sexual health guidelines during the pandemic".
These include the recommendation to have limited sex with a partner who has no symptoms or symptoms of the virus.
People infected with COVID-19 and people suspected of infection are recommended to self-quarantine.
Health organizations have developed detailed procedures for proper self-quarantine. Many governments have made self-quarantine mandatory or recommended for all populations living in contaminated areas.
The most serious self-quarantine orders have been issued for high-risk groups.
People who have been in contact with a person infected with COVID-19 and people who have recently travelled to a country or region with a widespread outbreak are advised to self-quarantine for up to 14 days from the time of the last possible contact.
Strategies for controlling the outbreak of a disease include imposing restrictions or mitigation and reducing the rate of outbreak.
The restriction is being implemented in the early stages of the outbreak and aims to track and isolate infected individuals and also introduce other disease control and vaccination measures to stop the spread of the disease to others.
When the onset of disease is no longer preventable, efforts go into a phase of mitigation: measures are taken to slow the spread of the virus and reduce its effects on the health system and society.
A combination of restrictive and mitigative measures may be applied simultaneously.
The suppression of the disease requires more stringent measures to reduce the base replication rate of the pandemic to less than 1. Part of pandemic management is to reduce the peak of the pandemic, also known as the smoothing of the epidemic curve.
This reduces the risk of overloading health services and allows more time for vaccine and treatment production.
Non-medical interventions that may control the spread of the virus include personal preventive measures, such as hand sanitization, wearing face masks and quarantine; public measures aimed at physical distancing, such as school holidays and cancellation of gatherings; public participation to encourage admission and participation in such interventions; as well as environmental measures such as surface cleaning.
Other countries have also taken various measures to limit the spread of the virus.
South Korea has resorted to public screening and local quarantine, warning against the movement and movement of infected people.
Singapore provided financial support for infectious cases that had isolated itself and imposed heavy fines on people who ignored the quarantine.
Taiwan increased the production of masks and imposed heavy fines for the use of medical equipment. Simulations conducted in relation to the United Kingdom and the United States showed that reducing the epidemic (to slow down and not stop the epidemic) and slowing down (to reverse the epidemic) posed major challenges.
Optimal adjuster policies may reduce the peak demand for healthcare services by two-thirds and by half, but they still lead to hundreds of thousands of deaths and overcapacity of health systems.
The crackdown can be prevented, but it must continue as long as the virus circulates among humans (or until a vaccine is developed, whichever comes first), otherwise when a little bit of strict measures are taken, the virus will rise again and spread.
Long-term intervention to combat the pandemic entails social and economic expenditure.
No specific antiviral medicines have been approved for COVID-19, but efforts are underway, including testing of existing drugs.
Taking an anti-epileptic medication without a prescription, drinking fluids and resting can be effective in relieving symptoms.
Depending on the severity, treatment with oxygen, intravenous fluids and auxiliary breathing may be necessary.
Steroid use may exacerbate the complications of the disease.
Several drug compounds that were previously effective in treating other viral diseases are being investigated for use in the treatment of COVID-19.
The World Health Organization also stated that some ""domestic and traditional practices"" can reduce the effects of SARS-CoV-19.
The World Health Organization has described increasing capacity and implementation of healthcare to address the needs of COVID-19 patients as a key response to the outbreak.
The European Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (ECDC) and the European Regional Office of the World Health Organization (WHO) have issued guidelines for hospitals and primary health and care services to convert resources at various levels, including from the focus of laboratory services towards COVID-19 testing, the abolition of selective procedures wherever possible, the abstraction and quarantine of COVID-19 positive patients, and the enhancement of special care capabilities through training of personnel and increased number of air conditioning machines and beds.
There are various theories regarding the identity of the first infected person (called patient number zero).
The first known case of the new coronavirus may return to Wuhan, Hubei and China on December 1, 2019.
Within a month, the number of coronavirus-infected cases in Hubei increased gradually.
Most of these were related to the Hunan seafood wholesale market where live animals were also sold, and one theory is that the virus originated from these species; in other words, it is zoonotic. A cluster of pneumonia with an unknown cause was observed on December 26 and was reported to the Wuhan Center for the Control of Hubei Disease on December 27 under the care of Dr. Zhang Jian.
"On December 30, a group of doctors at Wuhan's central hospital warned their colleagues about a ""semi-SARS coronavirus""".
Eight of these doctors, including Lee Wenliang, were questioned by the police for spreading false rumors, and another doctor, named IFN, was criticized by his superiors for raising the level of alert.
The Wuhan Municipal Health Commission later issued a public notice on December 31 and informed the World Health Organization.
A significant number of unknown cases of pneumonia were reported to health authorities in Wuhan in early January, prompting an investigation. In the early stages of the outbreak, the number of cases has doubled almost every seven and a half days.
In early and mid-January 2020, the virus spread to other Chinese provinces due to the Chinese New Year and the fact that Wuhan is one of the main transportation hubs and crossroads of mainline railways.
On January 20, China reported nearly 140 new cases, including two in Beijing and one in Shenzhen.
Later official data showed that as of January 20, 2020, 6,174 people had symptoms. As of March 26, the United States had the highest number of confirmed cases in the world, surpassing China and Italy. As of April 9, 2020, more than 1.61 million cases were reported worldwide; more than 97,000 people lost their lives and more than 364,000 people were recovered.
At least one case has been reported in about 200 countries and territories.
Due to the pandemic in Europe, many countries in the Schengen area restricted free movement and established border controls.
National responses have included restrictive measures such as quarantine (under titles such as stay-at-home orders, home-shelter orders or complete quarantine) and prohibitions. As of April 2, nearly 300 million people in the United States, or about 90 percent of the population, are under some form of home quarantine, more than 50 million in the Philippines, about 59 million in South Africa, and 1.3 million in India are under supplemental home quarantine.
On March 26, 1.7 billion people worldwide were under some form of quarantine, which two days later increased to 2.6 billion, about a third of the world's population.
The first confirmed case of COVID-19 dates back to 1 December 2019 in Wuhan; an unconfirmed report indicates that the first case was from 17 November.
Dr. Zhang Ji-jian diagnosed a cluster of pneumonia patients for an unknown reason on December 26 and immediately on December 27, his hospital referred the matter to the Jiang Han Wuhan Center for Disease Control.
The initial genetic testing of patient samples on December 27, 2019 indicated the presence of a quasi-SARS coronavirus.
A public notice was issued by the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission on December 31.
The World Health Organization was notified on the same day.
"With the release of these announcements, the police warned Dr. Wuhan about the ""spreading of rumors"" regarding the epidemic".
"The National Health Commission of China initially claimed that there was no ""confirmed evidence"" of human-to-human transmission of the disease".
"In late January, the Chinese government launched a radical campaign that was later described by Chinese Communist Party Secretary-General Xi Jinping as a ""people's war"" to contain the spread of the virus".
"At the time of what has been described as the ""longest quarantine in human history"", a health belt was announced on January 23 that stopped entry and exit to/from Wuhan and extended to 15 cities in Hubei, affecting about 57 million people".
The use of private vehicles in the city was prohibited.
Chinese New Year celebrations (January 25) were closed in many areas.
The authorities also announced the construction of a temporary hospital, Huoshenshan Hospital, which was completed in 10 days.

On the same day, travel restrictions in Hubei except Wuhan were relaxed two months after the mandatory quarantine was implemented. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Chinese government announced on March 26, 2020 that entry into the country for residents and visa holders would be suspended from March 28 and no details were announced on how long this policy would continue.
Those who intend to enter China must apply for a visa at Chinese embassies or consulates.

COVID-19 was confirmed to have entered South Korea from China on January 20, 2020.
The National Health and Medical Administration reported a significant increase in confirmed infections on February 20, which is more likely to stem from a rally in Daegu for a new religious movement called the Shincheonji Church of Christ.
Shinchongji supporters who met Dagu from Wuhan are suspicious of the virus' origin.

On March 11, the World Health Organization declared the spread of coronavirus a global pandemic.
The Director-General said that the WHO was "really concerned about the alarming levels of outbreaks and severity of the disease and the alarming levels of negligence".

Some senior Chinese officials, such as Zhao Liang, have declined early awareness of the Wuhan coronavirus outbreak, which has undermined US and Italian conspiracy theories regarding China as the root cause of the COVID-19 outbreak.
The US administration of Donald Trump has described the coronavirus as a "Chinese virus" or "Wuhan virus", saying that "the censorship has caused a viral outbreak that has now become a global pandemic", which in turn has been criticized by some critics as racism and "deviating attention from his administration's inefficiency in curbing the disease".
"Daily Beast has acquired a cable network for communication measures from the National Security Council that uses a strategy called ""everything is under China"".

China also urged the United States to lift sanctions against Syria, Venezuela and Iran to help them, while it has already sent a large amount of aid to the other two countries.
The grant of 100,000 masks by Jack Ma to Cuba was blocked on April 3 due to U.S. sanctions.

""The Iranian government has been severely affected by the virus, and nearly twenty-four members of parliament and fifteen other current or former political figures have been infected".
Iranian President Hassan Rouhani sent a heartfelt letter to world leaders asking for help on March 14, 2020, saying that his country was struggling to combat the outbreak due to lack of access to international markets as a result of U.S. sanctions against Iran. The outbreak has encouraged the United States to adopt social policies common in other wealthy countries, including global health, global child care, family allowance and higher public health funding.
Political analysts predicted that the pandemic could negatively impact Donald Trump's re-election chances in the 2020 presidential election and relations between Japan and South Korea.
"After Japan announced that it would quarantine all travelers entering South Korea for two weeks at locations designated by the government, South Korea criticized Japan for ""obscure and passive knowledge of quarantine efforts""".
The people of South Korea were polarized over President Moon Jae-in's response to the crisis.
A large number of Koreans signed scrolls that either demanded Moon's remission, for what they claimed was the government's inefficiency in the outbreak, or praised his response. The pandemic has allowed countries to enact emergency laws to implement appropriate response.
Some commentators have expressed concern that this may lead governments to hold power more firmly.
In Hungary, the country's parliament voted to allow Prime Minister Viktor Orbán to rule with unlimited power, suspend parliamentary and election proceedings, and punish those who spread false information about the virus and the government's handling of the crisis.
The coronavirus outbreak has been caused by several examples of material shortages, which are caused by increased use of coronavirus outbreak equipment, panic buying and disruption of factory and logistics operations.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has warned of shortages of medicines and medical equipment due to rising consumer demand and disruption in suppliers.
Several areas also saw a surge of public demand for shopping, which led to the shelves of the store being emptied of essential goods such as food, toiletries and water bottles, and caused a shortage of supply.
In particular, the technology industry has warned of delays in sending electronic goods.
According to Tedros Adhanom, Secretary General of the World Health Organization, the demand for personal protective equipment has increased 100fold.
This demand has led to a price increase of up to twenty times the normal price and has led to a four to six month delay in the supply of medical supplies.
It is also a leading cause of personal protective equipment shortages in the world, and the World Health Organization warns that it will endanger workers' health.
In Australia, the pandemic provided a new opportunity for Diego merchants to sell Australian products in China.
This activity caused a lack of infant milk in some supermarkets and was subsequently banned by the Australian government. Despite the high number of COVID-19 cases in northern Italy and the Wuhan region and the high demand for food, neither region suffered severe food loss.
China and Italy's actions against smuggling and illegal smuggling of essential goods were successful and prevented the severe food shortages that were predicted in Europe and North America.
Agricultural production in northern Italy, which produces mainly agricultural products, has not decreased significantly, but prices may rise, according to representatives of the sector.
Empty food shelves even in Wuhan were only temporary, while high-ranking Chinese officials opened pork stores to ensure adequate population nutrition.
Similar rules in Italy require food producers to store for such occasions.
Damage to the world economy was felt in China: According to a media report on March 16, the Chinese economy suffered a severe blow in the first two months of 2020 due to government measures to prevent the onset of the virus, with retailers falling 20.5%.
As the Chinese mainland is one of the main economic and manufacturing hubs, the outbreak of the virus is a major destabilizing threat to the global economy.
Agathe Demarais of the Economist Data Unit predicted that markets would remain unstable until the status of potential outcomes was more clearly defined.
In January 2020, some analysts estimated that the economic impact of the epidemic on global growth may be greater than the outbreak of SARS in 2002 to 2004.
According to an expert estimate from Washington University in St. Louis, the global supply chain will be affected by up to $300 billion, which will continue for up to two years.
According to reports by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), oil prices have been "seriously reduced" due to declining demand from China.
The global stock market crashed on February 24 due to a significant increase in COVID-19 cases outside mainland China.
On February 27, increased concerns over the coronavirus outbreak led to an unprecedented drop in the NASDAQ-100, S&amp;amp;amp;amp;P 500, and Dow Jones Industrial Average, which had the highest single-day drop since the 2007 financial crisis, with Dow Jones scoring 1,191 points.
All three indicators had a week-end drop of more than 10%.
On February 28, the rating company GmbH Scope confirmed China's credit rating but had a negative outlook.
Shares fell sharply again due to fears of coronavirus, with the biggest drop being on March 16.
Many see a recession as likely.
Mohammad Al-Arian, an economist, appreciated the timely emergency measures taken by central banks and countries.
Central banks reacted more quickly than the 2008 financial crisis.
Due to travel restrictions, public places such as tourist attractions being closed and governments advising against travel to other countries, the tourism industry is among the most affected.
As a result, several airlines have cancelled flights due to lack of demand, including British Airways, China Eastern Airlines and Qantas, while UK regional airline Flybe went bankrupt.
Its impact on the recreational boat industry was unprecedented.
Several train stations and ports have also been closed.
The epidemic coincided with the Chinese New Year holiday, which is the main travel season.
National and regional governments have canceled a number of events such as New Year's celebrations, which were held with large crowds, and private companies have independently closed their stores and tourist attractions such as Disneyland Hong Kong and Disneyland Shanghai.
Many Lunar New Year events and tourist attractions have been closed to prevent crowds, including the Forbidden City in Beijing and traditional temple exhibitions.
In 24 of China's 31 provinces, provincial and regional authorities extended the New Year's holiday until February 10, ordering most workplaces not to open that date.
These regions represented 80% of domestic production and 90% of export.
Hong Kong raised its response to the infectious disease to the highest level, declared a state of emergency, closed schools until March, and canceled New Year's celebrations. Retail sector worldwide has been affected, with their hours reduced or temporary holidays.
Retail visits in Europe and Latin America have fallen by 40%.
Retailers in the Middle East and North America saw a 50 to 60 percent sales gain.
This also led to a sharp decline in retail purchases in March compared to February.
The world's largest shopping mall operators have taken additional measures, such as increasing compliance with health principles, installing heat scanners to check the body temperature of shoppers and cancelling events. According to the UN Economic Commission for Latin America, the pandemic-related devastation will cause absolute poverty for 14 to 22 million people in Latin America, more than the number of non-pandemic cases.
In January and February 2020, during the peak of the pandemic in Wuhan, about 5 million people in China lost their jobs.
A large number of China's nearly 300 million rural migrant workers are trapped at home in remote provinces or in Hubei Province. In March 2020, more than 10 million Americans lost their jobs and applied for government assistance.
According to estimates by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, the coronavirus outbreak could affect up to 47 million jobs in the United States and raise the unemployment rate to 32%. Complementary quarantine in India has caused the unemployment of ten million Indian migrant workers (who work with wages). Results of a survey conducted by the Angus Reed Institute showed that 44 percent of Canadian families were somehow unemployed. Since the supplementary quarantine was implemented in Spain in mid-March 2020, about 900,000 workers have lost their jobs.
During the second half of March, 4 million French workers applied for temporary unemployment benefits and 1 million British workers applied for universal credit (universal Kurdish credit). Almost half a million companies in Germany implemented government-subsidized workers' short-term employment plans called Courzarbit.
Germany's short-term work compensation scheme has also been accepted by France and the United Kingdom.
Active sectors in the performing arts and cultural heritage were heavily affected by the negative aspects of the pandemic that have affected the performance of organizations and individuals, including employees and freelancers around the world.
Organizations of the cultural and artistic sector sought to support their mission (often with public funds) so that the public could access cultural heritage, maintain the safety of their employees and the public, and support artists where possible.
As of March 2020, museums, libraries, performance venues and other cultural institutions around the world, with varying degrees of success, were closed indefinitely, along with exhibitions, events and performances that were cancelled or postponed.
In response, many efforts have been made to provide alternative services through digital platforms. Another recent and accelerating case in disease reduction is the cancellation of religious events, important sporting events and other social events such as music festivals and concerts, technology conferences and fashion shows.
The film industry has also been disrupted. The Vatican announced that the tradition of Holy Week in Rome, which should have been instituted last week in the Christian fasting calendar, has also been abolished.
Many bishops have advised older Christians to stay home instead of attending Sunday services; some churches have broadcast church services by radio, online or television, while others recommend individual worship.
As the bishop of the Roman Catholic Church closed his large and small churches and St. Peter's Square was empty of Christian visitors, other religious institutions also canceled their services and restricted public gatherings in churches, mosques, synagogues, temples and shrines.
Iran's Ministry of Health announced that Friday prayers in the contaminated areas would be cancelled due to the outbreak and religious places would remain closed, while Saudi Arabia has banned pilgrimage to holy sites in Mecca and Medina for its citizens, while preventing the entry of foreign visitors.
The pandemic has caused the most significant disruption in the sporting events since World War II.
Most major sporting events have either been canceled or postponed, including the UEFA Champions League 2019-2020, the UEFA Premier League 2019-2020, UEFA Euro 2020, the NBA season and the NHL season from 2019 to 2020.
The outbreak also disrupted the 2020 Summer Olympics, which were originally scheduled to begin in late July; the International Olympic Committee announced on March 24 that the event would be "turned to a date other than 2020 but not beyond summer 2021". Casinos and other gaming venues around the world have been closed and live poker tournaments have either been postponed or canceled".
This has led to many gamblers turning to online gambling, and many online gambling sites have reported a significant increase in their site traffic. The entertainment industry has also been affected, and numerous music groups have suspended or canceled their concert tours.
Many major theaters, including those on Broadway, also suspended all their sci-fi productions.
"Some artists have explored ways to continue producing and sharing work via the Internet as an alternative to traditional live performances such as live concerts or creating web-based ""Internet festivals"" for artists to perform, distribute and promote their work".
Online coronavirus-themed trolls are circulating among the bluegrass community for distraction and humor.
Since the outbreak of COVID-19, there has been negative prejudice, xenophobia and extreme racism towards the people of China and East Asian nations and against the people of high-incidence European countries, the United States and other countries.
Incidents such as fear, suspicion and violence have been observed in many countries, especially in Europe, East Asia, North America and the Asia-Pacific region.
Reports from February (when most cases were confined to China) showed racial sentiments from numerous groups around the world that the Chinese people deserve the virus and what the hijacker was rightly claiming.
Some African countries have also seen rising anti-Chinese sentiment.
Many residents of Wuhan and Hubei reported being discriminated against because they were from the area.
There has been online and offline assistance from the virus-affected areas in China.
Following the progress of the outbreak in countries with new high prevalence rates, the people of Italy, the first country in Europe to experience a serious spread of COVID-19, could continue to be subject to the stigma and alien fear of citizens of other countries. Citizens in countries including Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore and South Korea initially signed rolls banning Chinese nationals from entering their country in an attempt to stop the disease.
In Japan, the hashtag #ChineseDontComeToJapan was tweeted.
The Chinese as well as other Asian people in the UK and the US have reported rising levels of racist insults and attacks.
"President Donald Trump has faced criticism for naming the coronavirus as a ""Chinese virus"", a term that critics consider to be a sign of racism and anti-Chinese".
Protesters in Ukraine attacked buses carrying Ukrainian and foreign citizens who had left Wuhan and moved to Novi Sankhari.
According to reports, students from the north-eastern regions of India, which shares a border with China, and students studying in major Indian cities are experiencing fear and anxiety over the outbreak of coronavirus.
"Dilip Ghosh, head of the Bharatiya Janata Party's state chapter in South Bengal, said that the Chinese destroyed nature and ""that is why God took vengeance on them"."
"These statements were later condemned and called ""false"" by the Chinese consulate in Calcutta. In China, foreign terrorism and racism against non-Chinese citizens has intensified after the pandemic, and foreign nationals were deemed as ""foreign garbage"" or were told to be thrown into the ""garbage can"".
Many newspapers with financial segments have removed these segments to cover news related to the coronavirus.
Many scientific publishers have made scientific papers related to the outbreak available to everyone free of charge.
Some scientists decided to share their results quickly on pre-printed servers such as bioRxiv.

Laboratory testing for respiratory coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and related SARS-CoV-2 includes two types of methods, methods that detect the presence of the virus and methods that detect the presence of antibodies created in response to the presence of infection.
The presence of viruses in samples confirmed by RT-PCR, which identifies the coronavirus RNA.
This is a special test and is designed to identify the RNA of SARS-CoV-2 virus only.
It is used to confirm very new or active infections.
Antibody detection (cermology) can be used for both disease diagnosis and population surveillance.
Anti-air tests showed how many people were infected, including those with symptoms so poor that they did not need to be reported or who had no symptoms.
The exact number of deaths and mortality from this disease and the level of cattle immunity in the population can be determined using the results of this test.
Due to limited testing, no country had reliable data on the spread of the virus among the population until March 2020.
As of March 23, no country had tested more than 3% of its population, and there is a significant difference in the number of tests performed in different countries around the world.
Convertibility is also likely to have a significant impact on reported deaths, which may be estimated in some countries to be significantly overly optimistic.
With the help of reverse transcriptional reverse resin (rRT-PCR) polymerase chain reaction, testing can be performed on respiratory samples obtained by various methods, including from an anaerobic or a vaginal sample.
Results are usually announced within a few hours or up to 2 days.
RT-PCR testing performed with a sample of the throat in the first week of the disease is reliable.
The virus may then disappear in the throat, although it continues to multiply in the lungs.
For infectious cases tested in the second week, the sample material can be obtained in turn, from the lower respiratory tract by catheter or extraction of the bladder (spasm).
One of the first PCR tests was prepared in January 2020 by Charita in Berlin, where the reverse transcriptional polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) was used to provide the basis for the manufacture of 250,000 kits distributed by the World Health Organization (WHO).
The UK has also conducted a test until 23 January 2020. Kogenebiotech in South Korea has also produced a clinical-grade SARS-CoV-2 detection kit, based on PCR, called PowerChek Coronavirus, on 28 January 2020.
"The gene ""E"" is present in all beta viruses and tracks the gene RdRp that is present only in SARS-CoV-2". In China, BGI Group was the first company to receive emergency use approval from the National Organization for Medicinal Products for China for a PCR base identification kit for the purpose of identifying SARS-CoV-2. In the United States, the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Panel for Real-Time RT-PCR Diagnosis of the New Coronavirus Disease 2019 (2019-nCoV) is making its International Reagent Resource available to public health laboratories".
One of the three genetic tests in older versions of the test kits failed due to a defect in the identifier, causing the testing at the CDC Atlanta to have problems, resulting in a decrease of 100 samples that were successfully evaluated on average daily in February 2020.
The reliability of the two-component tests was not determined until February 28, 2020, and state and local laboratories obtained permission to start testing from this date.
The test was approved by the Food and Drug Administration under an emergency use permit. U.S. commercial laboratories began testing it in early March 2020.
By March 5, 2020, LabCorp announced that RT-PCR-based COVID-19 testing will be available nationwide.
Quest Diagnostics also made COVID-19 test packages available nationwide from March 9, 2020.
No quarantine restrictions were announced; sampling and analysis were to be conducted in accordance with CDC requirements.
In Russia, the COVID-19 test was designed and produced by the State Research Center for Virology and Biotechnology.
On February 11, 2020, the test was registered by the Federal Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality. On March 12, 2020, it was reported that Mayo Clinic had produced a test to detect infection with COVID-19. On March 13, 2020, Roche Diagnostics received FDA approval for a test that could be performed in 3.5 hours and in large volumes, resulting in a machine being able to perform approximately 4,128 tests every 24 hours.
On March 19, 2020, the Food and Drug Administration issued an emergency use authorization (EUA) for Abbott Laboratories for testing of Abbott's m2000 system; the Food and Drug Administration had previously issued a similar authorization for Hologic, LabCorp and Thermo Fisher Scientific.
On March 21, 2020, Cepheid received EUA from the Food and Drug Administration for a 45-minute trial.
The Food and Drug Administration has approved a trial using isothermal nucleic acid enhancement technology instead of PCR.
Since this does not require a set of alternating temperature cycles, this method can determine a positive result in just 5 minutes and a negative result in 13 minutes.
There are currently 18,000 of these machines in the United States, and Abbott plans to produce 50,000 tests per day with increased production soon. An experiment is currently underway in Taiwan using monoclonal antibody, a substance that specifically binds the nucleoacid protein (N protein) to new coronavirus; this type of test is expected to yield results in 15 to 20 minutes, similar to a rapid flu test.
"Until March 2020, a review of records concluded that ""Castle Cage Radiography is of little value for early disease diagnosis, while CT findings may even be present before symptoms appear"."
Including the common features of CT, it can refer to bi-directional polygonal matte glass cores with a lateral, uneven, and posterior distribution (posterior).
Subpleural dominance occurs with disease progression, penetration, and unrecognized patterns (crazy paving).
A study in Wuhan, the birthplace of the psycho-pandemic, compared PCR and CT to each other and declared that CT is significantly more sensitive than PCR, although less specialized and has many imaging characteristics in common with other diseases of the chest (pneumonia) and respiratory problems.
"Until March 2020, the recommendation of the US Department of Radiology was that ""CT should not be used for disease screening as the first line of testing for COVID-19 diagnosis"."Until March 2020, the CDC recommended that PCR be used for screening".
Part of the immune system's response to disease is the production of antibodies such as IgM and IgG.
These can be used to diagnose disease in individuals, 7 days or more after the onset of symptoms, to determine immunity and for population surveillance. Tests can be performed in central laboratories (CLT) or point of care testing (PoCT).
High-power automated systems in many laboratories will be able to perform these assessments, but their availability depends on the production ratio for each system.
A single blood sample is usually used for CLT, however, continuous samples can be used to track immune system response.
For PoCT, blood sampling is usually done by puncturing the skin.
Unlike PCR, pre-testing outcomes are not required. On March 26, 2020, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) introduced 29 companies that had notified the organization of the requirements and could consequently distribute their antibody tests.
As of April 7, 2020, only one single test has been approved by the FDA for emergency use. In late March 2020, Euroimmun Medical Laboratory Diagnostics and Epitope Diagnostics received European approvals for their test kits, which can detect IgG and IgA antibodies against the virus in blood samples.
The test capacity is several hundred samples per hour and is therefore much faster than the usual PCR assessment for viral RNA.
Anti-aircraft kits are usually detectable up to 14 days after infection begins. In early April, the UK announced that none of the anti-aircraft test kits purchased were good enough.
"Hong Kong has established a plan whereby those suspected of illness can stay at home, ""the emergency department will give the patient a sample tube"", the patient will put it inside the tube, re-send it and receive the test result after a while. The NHS in the UK has announced that it is testing a plan whereby suspected cases are tested at home to eliminate the risk of transmission on the way to hospital or the need to disinfect a patient's carrier ambulance.
Drive-through centers helped South Korea to implement one of the fastest and most comprehensive tests in the world. In Germany, the National Union of Medical Medical Insurers announced on March 2 that it had the capacity to conduct about 12,000 tests per day inside an ambulance, with 10,700 tests carried out the week before.
When the doctor prescribes the test, health insurance will cover the costs.
According to the head of the Robert Koch Institute, Germany has a capacity to conduct a total of 160,000 tests per week.
Testing services were offered in horseback riding in some major cities until March 19.
Until 26 March 2020, the total number of tests conducted in Germany was also unknown, as only positive results were reported.
"The first laboratory study showed that at least 4,83,295 samples were tested by the calendar week of 12/2020, with a total of 3,3491 people (6.9%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 in Israel. In Israel, researchers at Technion and Rimbaum Hospital developed a method for simultaneous testing of 64 patients, in which all samples were combined and tested, and if the result was positive, samples were tested individually. A 2,000-square-meter emergency diagnostic laboratory in Wuhan called ""ho-yan"" (Chinese: 火眼, meaning ""eyes of fire") was opened on 5 February 2020 by BGI, which tested it in 100 days.
BGI founder Wang Jian personally oversaw the five-day project; modeling revealed that if this capacity had not been added, infection cases in Hubei would have been 47% higher and the cost of enforcing the quarantine would have been doubled.
After the Wuhan Laboratory, Hu-Yan Laboratories were quickly established in Shenzhen, Tianjin, Beijing and Shanghai, a total of 12 cities across China.
As of March 4, 2020, the total output of the Yume has grown to over 50,000 tests. Open source and composite designs produced by Origami Assays have been published and can be used to test 1,122 adult samples for COVID-19 using 93 tests. These balanced designs can be implemented in small laboratories without the need for robotic fluid-based tools.
Until March, shortages and insufficient identification values were one of the main shortcomings in mass production in the EU, UK and USA.
This led some researchers to review sample preparation protocols that included heating samples to a temperature of 98 degrees Celsius (208 degrees Fahrenheit) for 5 minutes to release RNA genomes for subsequent testing. On March 31, it was announced that the UAE had tested more people against coronavirus than any other country at that time and was on track to reach the test level of its entire population.
"This was achieved by combining the ability to provide equestrian services and purchase a mass-scale sample laboratory from Group 42 and BGI (based on the emergency identification laboratories ""Ho-Yan"" in China)".
The lab, built in 14 days, is capable of performing tens of thousands of RT-PCR tests daily and is the first specimen of this scale to be operated outside China.
Different testing procedures targeting different parts of the coronavirus genetic profile have been developed in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan, and the United States.
The World Health Organization has used German guidelines to manufacture kits sent to low-income countries that do not have sufficient resources to manufacture kits.
The German guidelines were published on January 17, 2020; the U.S. Centers for Disease Control protocol was not available until January 28, and delayed testing available in the U.S. China and the U.S. had concerns about the reliability of test kits early in the outbreak, and these countries and Australia were unable to provide enough kits to meet the requirements and recommendations of health experts for testing.
On the other hand, experts say that widespread access to testing in South Korea has helped reduce the spread of new coronavirus.
Testing capacity, mainly in the form of private sector laboratories, was developed over several years by the South Korean government.
On March 16, the World Health Organization announced that testing programs should be accelerated as the best way to slow the progression of the COVID-19 pandemic. The high demand for testing due to the widespread spread of the virus had led to hundreds of thousands of tests being stacked in private laboratories in the United States and the supply of sampling equipment and chemicals was difficult.
In March 2020, China reported that the country's production test kits were problematic and inaccurate.
"In the United States, test kits manufactured by the CDC were ""deficient""; the government then removed the administrative barriers that prevented private testing. Spain purchased the test kits from a Chinese company named Shenzhen Bioeasy Biotechnology Co Ltd but found the results to be inaccurate".
The company explains that incorrect results may be the result of not receiving a suitable sample or incorrect use of the test kit.
The Spanish Ministry of Defense announced that it would collect the kits containing the incorrect results and convert them to a different test kit provided by Shenzhen Bioeasy. 80% of the test kits purchased by the Czech Republic from China gave the wrong results. Slovakia purchased 1.2 million test kits from China, which were found to be inaccurate.
Prime Minister Matović suggested that they be dumped into the Danube Sea. Fire Kara, a member of the Turkish Ministry of Health, said that the test kits purchased by Turkey from China had a "high error rate" and were "not used".
Testing with quarantine of people who tested positive and tracking of people who had contact with people infected with SARS-CoV-2 resulted in positive outcomes.
Researchers working in the Italian city of Vo, where the first recorded COVID-19 death in Italy occurred, conducted two phases of testing on all 3,400 residents of the city, approximately ten days apart.
About half of those who tested positive had no symptoms and all cases detected were quarantined.
By restricting urban travel, new infections were eliminated in a complementary way.
The coronavirus pandemic in 2020 in Singapore has spread much slower than in other developed countries due to severe contact withdrawal, restrictions on domestic travel, testing and quarantine, but no severe restrictions such as mandatory holidays in restaurants and retail centres have been imposed.
Many events were canceled and Singapore advised its citizens to stay home on March 28, but schools reopened on March 23 after a holiday.
Several other countries, such as Iceland and South Korea, managed the pandemic with strict call-back programs, restrictions on domestic travel, testing and quarantine, but had fewer strict leave.
A statistical study found that countries that conducted more diagnostic tests than the death rate had much lower death rates, probably because they were better able to identify mental illness with only mild symptoms or no symptoms.
The World Health Organization recommends that countries that do not have the capacity to conduct testing and have laboratories with limited experience with COVID-19 submit their first five positive and first ten negative COVID-19 samples to one of the 16 WHO reference laboratories for approval.
Outside of the 16 reference laboratories, 7 cases were in Asia, 5 cases in Europe, 2 cases in Asia, 1 case in North America and 1 case in Australia.
"In the table below, the column ""positive by % of tests"" is influenced by the testing guidelines of each country".
Under perfectly equal conditions, a country that tests only hospitalized people has a higher percentage of positive cases than a country that tests all citizens, regardless of symptoms.
Hand washing (or hand washing), also known as hand sanitization, is an activity that is done to remove dirt, fat, microorganisms, or other unwanted substances from a person's hands.
"Continuous handwashing with soap at ""critical moments"" throughout the day prevents the spread of many diseases, such as diarrhea and epidemics, which are transmitted through the gastrointestinal tract".
Also, people can become infected with respiratory diseases such as influenza or common cold if they do not wash their hands before touching their eyes, nose, or mouth (e.g., mucous membranes).
There are five important times a day to wash hands with soap to reduce the transmission of the disease: after bathing (drinking and vomiting), after cleaning the baby's underwear (cloth changing), before feeding the baby, before eating and before and after cooking or when touching raw meat, fish or meats.
If there is no soap or water, you can also rub your hands in ash. The World Health Organization recommends handwashing:
Before, during and after preparing food.
Before and after caring for a patient.
After changing a diaper or cleaning a baby who has used the toilet.
After emptying the nose, cough or sore throat.
After touching animals, feeding them and touching their waste.
Medical hygiene refers to health activities related to medical procedures.
Hand washing before medication or treatment can prevent or minimize the spread of the virus.
The main medical purpose is to wash hands, cleanse hands of pathogens (bacteria, viruses or other microorganisms that can cause disease) and chemicals that can cause injury or disease.
It is particularly important for people who work with food or in the medical field, but it is also an important exercise for the general public.
Handwashing has many benefits, including reducing the spread of influenza, coronavirus and other infectious diseases; preventing infections that lead to diarrhea; and reducing respiratory infections.
and reducing infant mortality rates in domestic births.
A 2013 study found that improved handwashing practices may lead to minor improvements in the average growth of children younger than five years.
In developing countries, infant mortality rates associated with respiratory diseases and diarrhea can be reduced by simple behavioral transformations such as handwashing with soap.
This simple approach can reduce the mortality rate in these diseases by up to 50%.
Interventions that promote handwashing are able to reduce diarrhea by about a third, equivalent to providing clean water in low-income areas.
48% of cases of diarrhea decrease in fractures can be attributed to hand washing with soap. Hand washing with soap is the most effective and cheapest method of preventing diarrhea and respiratory infections (ARI), which is done as a routine activity in homes, schools and communities around the world.
Pneumonia, a major ARI, is the number one cause of death among children under five, claiming 1.8 million lives annually.
Diarrhoea, chest and wrist jointly cause the deaths of approximately 3.5 million children per year.
According to UNICEF, changing hand washing before eating and after taking a bath to a sustainable habit can save more lives than any other type of vaccine or medical intervention, cutting diarrheal mortality by nearly half and reducing deaths from acute respiratory infections by up to a quarter.
Handwashing is usually completed with other water-based disinfectant interventions, disinfectants, and personal health programs (WASH).
Hand washing also prevents impetigo, which is transmitted through direct physical contact.
The minor disruptive effect of hand washing is that frequent hand washing can lead to skin damage due to dry skin.
A 2012 study in Denmark found that excessive hand washing can lead to skin itching, also known as eczema or skin amnesia, a condition that is particularly prevalent among healthcare workers.
Excessive hand washing is also known as an indicator of obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD).
There are five important times a day to wash hands with soap to reduce the transmission of the disease: after taking a bath (drinking and vomiting), after cleaning the baby's underwear (cloth changing), before feeding the baby, before eating and before/after cooking or when touching raw meat, fish or meats.
Other times when hand washing techniques should be followed to prevent disease transmission include before and after wound or injury treatment, after coughing, sneezing, or flushing; after touching animal waste or handling animals; and after touching garbage.
In many countries, handwashing with soap is low.
A study on handwashing in 54 countries in 2015 found that an average of 38.7% of people washed their hands with soap. In 2014, a study found that Saudi Arabia had the highest rate of handwashing upwards, at 97%, the United States had the nearest average rate, at 77% and China the lowest rate, at 23%. Several behavioral conversion methodologies in handwashing with soap are currently in place.
"The ""Critical Health Care Program"" was launched by the Department of Education in the Philippines and is an example of measures to improve the health and education of children".
Twice a year, the removal of worms, along with hand washing, and brushing with fluoride, are the highlights of the national program.
It has also been successfully implemented in Indonesia.
The removal of microorganisms from the skin is enhanced by the addition of soap or detergent to water.
The main function of soaps and detergents is to reduce dissolving barriers in water, so that solubility is increased.
Water alone is an inefficient cleanser for the skin, as fat and proteins, which are the constituents of organic soil, are not easily soluble in water.
However, cleaning with running water helps...
Solid soap may have a slightly higher bacterial content than previous uses due to its reusable properties.
Few studies that thought bacterial transmission from contaminated solid soaps was possible concluded that such transmission was unlikely, as bacteria were washed with soap floors.
The CDC further states: ""Liquid soap is preferred with the possibility of use without the need for hand contact"."
Antibacterial soaps have been widely promoted to promote public health.
To date, there is no evidence that the use of antiseptics or recommended disinfectants can produce antibiotic-resistant organisms in nature.
However, antibacterial soaps contain common antibacterial agents such as triclosan, which have a wide list of resistant organisms.
Therefore, even if antibiotic-resistant strains are not eliminated by antibacterial soaps, they may not be as effective as previously advertised on the market.
In addition to surfactants and skin protectors, this advanced formula may include acids (stearic acid, ascorbic acid, and lactic acid) as pH regulators, antimicrobial-grade active benzoic acid, and other skin moisturizers (alloys, vitamins, mentols, plant extracts). A comprehensive analysis by the Faculty of Public Health at the University of Oregon showed that simple soaps are as effective as grade one antibacterial soaps, including triclosan, in preventing disease and eliminating hand bacteria.
Hot water that is easy to wash hands is not hot enough to kill bacteria.
Bacteria grow faster at body temperature (37 degrees Celsius).
However, hot soap water is more effective than cold soap water in eliminating natural particles that contain soil and bacteria.
However, contrary to popular belief, scientific research has shown that hot water consumption has no effect on reducing hand viruses.
An hand sanitizer or hand sanitizer is a non-aquatic-based hand sanitizer.
In the late 1990s and early 21st century, non-hydraulic hand sanitizers (known as alcohol-based hand sanitizers, hand sanitizers, or hand sanitizers) became less well known.
They are often alcohol-based isopropyl or ethanol with a solvent such as a carburetor (acrylic acid polymer) that is converted into gel, or a moisturizer such as glycerin inside a liquid, or foam intended to facilitate the use of alcohol and reduce the drying effect of alcohol.
The addition of dilute hydrogen peroxide increases antimicrobial activity. Hand sanitizers, including at least 60 to 95% alcohol, have a long-term effect on killing germs.
Alcoholic disinfectants are harmful, eliminate bacteria, multi-drug resistant bacteria (MRSA and VRE), the cause of tuberculosis and a number of viruses (including HIV, herpes, RSV, rhinovirus, vaccines, influenza and hepatitis) and fungi.
70% alcoholic disinfectants can kill up to 99.97% (decreased lagarity 3.5, similar to a 35 decibel decrease) of hand bacteria in less than 30 seconds and 99.99% to 99.999% (decreased lagarity 4 to 5) of hand bacteria in 1 minute.
Alcohol-based hand sanitizers are almost ineffective as a supplement to neurovirus (or Norwalk), the most common cause of infectious gastroenteritis. A sufficient hand sanitizer or alcohol soaking should be applied to the skin by fully moisturizing it and covering both hands.
The front and back of both hands and the middle and end of all fingers are rubbed for about 30 seconds to dry the fluid, floor or skin.
The tips of the fingers should also be washed well with a hand socket. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends hand washing, especially when hands are obviously dirty, as better than hand sanitizers.
The increased use of these detergents is due to their ease of use and rapid activity in eliminating microorganisms; however, they should not be used as a substitute for proper hand washing unless soap and water are available.
Frequent use of alcoholic disinfectants causes dry hands unless a moisturizer and/or softener is added to their formula.
The drying effect of alcohol can be reduced by adding glycerin and/or other moisturizers to the formula.
In clinical trials, alcohol-based hand sanitizers containing moisturizers produced less inflammation and dryness compared to soaps containing antibacterial agents.
Allergic contact dermatitis, contact itch syndrome or hypersensitivity to alcohol or to additives present in hand-held alcoholic juices rarely occur.
It is popular because it causes less itchy contact dermatitis than hand washing with soap and water.
Despite their high performance, non-blue base agents do not remove the hands from the organic matter, they disinfect them.
This is why hand sanitizers are not as effective as soap and water in preventing pathogen release, as pathogenic agents remain on the hand.
The effectiveness of non-alcoholic hand sanitizers is heavily dependent on the ingredients and formulations and has historically been much less effective than alcohol and alcoholic drinks.
Recently, formulations using benzalkonium chloride have shown continued and increasing antimicrobial activity after use, unlike alcohol, which after repeated use is likely to cause decreased efficacy due to the anti-aging reactions.
Many people in low-income communities cannot afford soap and use dirt and ash.
Ash or dust may be more effective than water, but probably less effective than soap.
Another concern is soil or ash contamination with microorganisms that may contribute more to disease spread than to disease reduction.
Ashes, like soap, are an antimicrobial agent, as they form an alkaline solution when in contact with water.
The World Health Organization recommends using soap, ash or brine as a substitute for soap when soap is not available.
The proper hand washing technique recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control to prevent disease transmission includes the following steps:
And thou shalt put thy hands in cold water, or in warm water.
Current water is recommended because rock-fed pools may be contaminated, although the water temperature may not appear to be different.
Wash your hands, including the back of your hands, between your fingers and under your nails, with plenty of soap.
Soap separates germs from the skin, and studies show that people wash their hands more thoroughly when using soap than when using only clear water.
Wash your hands for at least 20 seconds.
Hand massage causes friction which helps to kill germs, while hand massage eliminates more germs for longer periods.
Drink well under the tap.
Washing in a single sink can re-infect the hand.
Dry the needle with a clean cloth or let it dry in the summer.
Wet, wet hands are more easily re-infected. Parts that are not washed often include the thumb, wrist, between the fingers and under the nails.
Artificial nails and cut nail polishes may be contaminated with microorganisms.
Moisturizing creams are often recommended to prevent dry hands; dry skin can lead to skin damage, which can increase the risk of infection transmission.
"Various affordable options can be used if needed in developing countries to facilitate hand washing where tap water and/or soap are not available. For example, pouring water and/or soap from a suspended gallon or dry cotton leather with suitable holes and/or using ash. In limited irrigation conditions (such as schools or rural areas in developing countries), water-saving solutions such as ""categoryless tapes"" and other low-cost options exist".
Hand-free tape is a simple technique that uses a piece of cloth suspended by a rope and a lever with a foot to pour a small amount of water on the hands and a soap mold.
Proper hand drying is an important part of sanitation, but the most effective method of hand drying in public toilets is debated.
The increasing volume of research shows that paper hand dryers are much healthier than electric dryers used in most toilets.
In 2008, a study by the University of Westminster in London and with the financial support of the European Textile Hand Towel Industry, was conducted to compare the health levels offered by paper towels, hot air hand dryers and Airjet hand dryers.
After washing and drying hands with a hot air dryer, it was found that the average total number of bacteria on the floor of the finger increased by 194% and on the floor of the hand by 254%.
Air-breathing hand drying resulted in an average increase in the number of bacteria on the floor of the finger to 42% and on the floor of the hand to 15%.
After washing and drying hands with a paper towel, the total number of bacteria decreased by an average of 76 percent on the fingertips and 77 percent on the palms. Scientists also conducted tests to determine whether there was a possibility of mutual infection among other bathroom users and the bathroom environment due to the use of any type of drying method.
Airjet air dryers, which expel air from the car at a speed of 180 meters per second (650 km/h), are capable of inhaling microorganisms from the hand and device and potentially contaminate bathroom users and the bathroom environment up to a distance of 2 meters.
The use of a hand dryer spreads microorganisms to a depth of 0.25 m.
Paper hand wipes did not show signs of microorganism dissemination. In 2005, a study by TÜV Produkt und Umwelt examined different methods of hand drying.
The following changes in the number of bacteria were observed after hand drying:
There are many different types of hand dryer manufacturers, and hand dryers have been compared to paper hand dryers.
Hand washing with disinfectant towels when traveling can be a substitute for soap and water.
Alcoholic disinfectants must contain at least 60% alcohol.
Medical hand washing was forced long after a Hungarian physician, Ignaz Smolovis (1846), discovered its effectiveness in preventing disease in a hospital setting.
There are a number of electronic devices that use feedback to remind medical personnel not to forget to wash their hands.
One study showed a decrease in infection rates using them.
Medical hand washing is done using sufficient amounts of soap and water or a towel and a massage of each hand for at least 15 seconds.
And the hands shall be locked with the fingers locked together.
If there is any tooth and fabric under the nails, it is best to use a hair brush to clean it.
Since germs remain in water and on the hands, it is important to water properly and then dry the hands with a clean cloth.
After drying, a paper scrubber should be used to close the water tap (and open any outlet drill if necessary).
This prevents re-contamination of the hands through such surfaces.
"The goal of hand washing in health care facilities is to eliminate pathogenic microorganisms (""microbes") and prevent the spread of the virus".
The New England Journal of Medicine reports that handwashing deficiencies are unacceptable in most healthcare settings, and many doctors and nurses forget to wash their hands before contact with a patient, causing microorganism transmission.
One study found that proper hand washing and other simple tasks can reduce the rate of catheter-borne blood infections by up to 66%. The World Health Organization has published a paper to show how to wash hands properly and disinfect the hands in healthcare sectors.
The draft Hand Sanitation Guide, prepared by the WHO, is available to the public on the WHO website.
A related review study was conducted by Whitby and colleagues.
If compliance with regulations is required, commercial devices can measure and verify hand sanity.
The World Health Organization defines "five ways" for hand washing:
After contact with blood/fluids
before the anti-inflammatory action is taken, and
"After taking care of the patient. Adding chemical disinfectants to soap (soap for "medical" or "antibacterial") helps the microbial properties of handwashing agents".
"Such lethal measures are likely to be desirable before surgery or in situations where antibiotic-resistant organisms are highly prevalent. For the ""cleaning"" of a person's hands for surgery, a water bottle need to be unnecessarily touchy, open and closed, a chlorohydrogen or iodin washer, sterile hand dryers to dry hands after washing and a sterile brush for layering and another sterile tool for cleaning the nails underneath".
And all the jewels shall be cast away.
The procedure involves washing hands and a clock to the wrist for two to six minutes.
It is not necessary to give it too long (ten minutes).
When washing hands, water that is poured on the watch should not reach the hands again.
After the washing is completed, the hands are dried with a sterile hand wash and the hand is operated.
To reduce the release of germs, it is best to wash your hands before and after treatment, or use an anti-inflammatory agent.
In the context of the control of staph infections in hospitals, it has been proven that the main benefit of hand washing is only 20% of the initial time of washing and that continuing to wash until further 35% provides little added benefit.
Washing with simple soap leads to a threefold increase in the rate of transmission of bacterial infections compared to washing with antibacterial soap to food. Comparison of hand washing with an alcohol-based solution with an antibacterial soap for an average of 30 seconds showed that hand washing with alcohol reduces bacterial infection by 26% more than with antibacterial soap.
However, soap and water are more effective than alcohol-based hand sanitizers in reducing H1N1 influenza A virus and Clostridium difficile infections. Interventions to improve hand hygiene in health care facilities can include training staff on washing, increasing access to alcohol-based hand sanitizers, and written and oral reminders for staff.
More research is needed to determine which of these interventions is most effective in different health care facilities.
In developing countries, hand washing with soap is recognized as an affordable and essential means to achieve optimal health and even proper nutrition.
However, the lack of water, soap, or safe handwashing equipment in people's homes, schools, and workplaces makes it a challenge to achieve global handwashing practices.
For example, in rural Africa, hand washing machines are scarce near private or public toilets, although there are affordable options for building hand washing facilities.
However, low rates of handwashing can be partly a result of established habits such as the absence of soap or water.
Encouraging and supporting handwashing with soap can influence policy decisions, raise awareness of the benefits of handwashing, and lead to a long-term behavior change in the population.
Monitoring and evaluation are essential for effective functioning.
"A systematic review of 70 studies found that community-based approaches were effective in increasing handwashing in LMICs, while social marketing campaigns were less effective. An example of promoting handwashing in schools is the 'three-star walk' by UNICEF, which encourages schools to take simple, inexpensive steps, such as making sure that in addition to meeting other health needs, students wash their hands with soap".
After achieving minimum ratings, schools can be promoted from one star to three stars.
Handwashing stations can be built as part of handwashing campaign promotions aimed at reducing childhood illness and death.
World Handwashing Day is another example of an awareness-raising campaign that seeks to transform behavior. In the wake of the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic, UNICEF promoted the use of handwashing emojis.
Few studies have considered the overall impact of handwashing cost effectiveness in developing countries in relation to DALYs.
However, one study shows that promoting handwashing with soap is much cheaper than other water and sanitation interventions.
"The importance of hand washing to human health, especially for people with vulnerable conditions such as newborn mothers or injured soldiers in hospitals, was first introduced in the mid-19th century by two pioneers of hand hygiene: Hungarian doctor Inias Smálvis, who worked in Vienna, Austria, and Florence Nightingale, who was ""the architect of the modern transitional nurse"" in England".
At the time, the majority of the population believed that infections were the result of bad smells, which they called myasmas.
In the 1980s, the outbreak of foodborne infections and health-care-related infections led the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to actively promote hand hygiene as an important method of preventing the onset of infections.
The 2009 swine flu outbreak and the 2020 global COVID-19 pandemic have raised awareness among many countries about the importance of hand washing to prevent such infectious diseases.
"For example, posters containing ""right hand washing techniques"" were installed alongside the sinks in public toilets and in the bathrooms of German office buildings and airports".
"The phrase ""to wash one's hands of"" something, means a declaration of one's unwillingness to accept responsibility or share in it".
It originates from a passage in the Gospel of Matthew in which Pontius Pilate refuses to accept the decision to crucify Jesus Christ, but has found wider application in some English conversations.
"In Shakespeare's ""Macbeth"", Lady Macbeth is often unwittingly touched to clear the stain of her conscience from the crimes she committed and forced her husband to commit".
It has also been shown that people wash their hands more often than others after recalling or thinking about immoral activities and pay more attention to hand washing and hand washing.
"In addition, people who are allowed to wash their hands after such care are less likely to participate in other forced ""refrigeration"" measures, such as volunteering".
Religions prescribe hand washing for health and symbolic purposes. Symbolic hand washing, using water without soap to wash hands, is part of ritual hand washing that has been represented in many religions including the Bahá'í Faith, Hinduism, Twelve-Day Adventists, and the Latter Day Saint movement in Judaism, Laobahu in Christianity, and Vitu in Islam. Religions especially after certain practices, recommend healthy hand washing.
Hinduism, Judaism and Islam dictate that people wash their hands after going to the bathroom.
And Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, Judaism and Islam have taught that people wash their hands before and after every meal.
Control of workplace hazards for COVID-19
Risk control in the workplace for COVID-19 means the use of occupational health and safety measures to control risks and prevent the onset of the 2019 coronavirus (COVID-19).
Risk control in the workplace depends on the workplace and the task of the contractor and varies according to the risk assessment of sources of contagion, severity of the disease in the community and risk factors for each worker who may be vulnerable to COVID-19.
According to the US Department of Health and Human Services (OSHA), low-risk businesses have a minimum level of work contact with the general public and other colleagues, and these businesses are advised to take at least the necessary precautions to prevent infection, including hand washing, encouraging employees to stay home in case of illness, wearing masks and cleaning, and regular workplace disinfection.
Medium-risk businesses include those that do not require close or close contact with people suspected or infected with COVID-19, but may be at risk due to direct contact with the public or international travel.
This includes employees who are in contact with the public in spaces such as schools, high-density workplaces and some large retail stores.
Risk control for this group, in addition to initial infection prevention measures, includes air conditioning using high-efficiency air filters, protection against thirst and access to personal protective equipment to deal with COVID-19 infected individuals.
OSHA considers healthcare and medical personnel who are exposed to people suspected of COVID-19 to be in high-risk occupations, which can be raised to a high-risk level if they are using aerosol-producing procedures or taking samples from people suspected or infected with COVID-19.
Including occupational hazard controls that are suitable for these employees, engineering controls such as negative air pressure rooms and occupational personal protective equipment can be referred to.
The COVID-19 outbreak can have multiple effects in the workplace.
Employees may not be available at work due to illness, the need to care for others, or fear of being exposed to illness.
Commercial patterns can change, both in terms of the goods being demanded and in terms of the way these goods are received (e.g. buying outside peak hours or through on-site delivery services or ride services).
Finally, shipping goods from geographic areas heavily affected by COVID-19 can be problematic. A plan for preparation and response to infectious diseases can be used to guide preventive measures.
The plans take into account the level of risk associated with various workplaces and occupational tasks, including sources of contact with disease, risk factors in the social environment and home, and risk factors for each worker separately, including from cavity or chronic illness.
The plan also outlines appropriate control practices necessary to prevent these risks and alternative plans for situations that may follow the outbreak.
Preparation and response plans for infectious diseases may be implemented taking into account national or local recommendations.
The objectives for responding to the outbreak are to reduce transmission among employees, protect those at higher risk for communicable diseases, maintain commercial activities and minimize adverse effects on other institutions in their supply chains.
The severity of the disease affects responses received in society, where businesses are located.
Risk control hierarchy is a framework that is widely used to maintain occupational health and safety to group risk control based on the extent of impact.
Where there is no possibility of eliminating the risks of COVID-19, engineering controls and subsequent administrative controls and ultimately personal protective equipment are among the most effective methods of control.
Engineering controls involve the abstraction of employees from work-related risks without relying on employee behavior, which can be the most cost-effective solution.
Administrative controls are the changes that are given in a workflow or procedures and that employees or employees must act on.
Personal protective equipment (PPE) has less impact on administrative and engineering controls but can prevent some risks.
All PPE types must be selected based on the risks to employees, installed appropriately (e.g. medical masks), used consistently and regularly, subjected to inspection, service, replacement, and re-installed, cleaned and re-installed if necessary, or discarded to prevent infection.
According to the U.S. Occupational Health and Safety Administration (OSHA), fewer at-risk jobs with the lowest number of job contacts with the general public or other colleagues are at risk.
He noted that preventive measures to prevent disease are recommended for people in all areas of work, including regular hand washing and hand-washing, encouraging employees to stay at home if they are sick, wearing respiratory masks and, of course, covering their mouths when coughing or sneezing, access to paper towels and garbage cans, preparation for remote contact or irregular working hours if necessary, encouraging employees to use other tools and equipment, and having a regular plan for cleaning and disinfection of the work environment.
Rapid identification and dissemination of people who are likely to be infected is a critical step in protecting employees, customers, clients and others present in the workplace.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that employees with symptoms of severe respiratory illness stay at home for at least 24 hours after stopping the use of antifungal medications or medications that can turn symptoms into symptoms until fever, fever and other symptoms resolve, and that the reference licensing policy be more flexible to allow employees to stay at home to care for family members who are sick and that all employees be informed of these new guidelines.
According to the OSHA announcement, medium-risk occupations include occupations that require high contact frequencies and relatively close distance within a six-foot (1.8 m) range from others, and it is unclear whether clients are infected with COVID-19, but they may be infected with SARS-CoV-2 due to ongoing community outreach or international travel to a place where COVID-19 has spread.
These include personnel in contact with the public, such as those in schools, busy workplaces and some of the most vulnerable retail spaces. Engineering controls for these groups and groups at risk include installation of high-efficiency air filters, increased ventilation rates, installation of physical barriers such as plastic droplet protection and installation of rideshows for customer service. Operational controls for these groups and groups at risk include encouraging patient staff to stay at home, encouraging people to switch to virtual meetings, creating variable work schedules, cancelling non-essential travel to areas facing COVID-19 outbreaks, regulating the risks associated with plastic drops and installing rideshows for customer service.
Workers in this risk group rarely need respirators.
If a person becomes ill on an aircraft, appropriate controls can be used to protect staff and other passengers, by separating the patient from others and creating a minimum distance of 6 feet, assigning a dedicated crew to the patient and providing a face mask to the patient and requiring him to cover his mouth and nose with a towel when coughing or sneezing.
Cabin crew must wear disposable gloves when delivering services to a sick passenger or touching any body wash or contaminated surfaces and use other personal protective equipment if possible if the patient is suffering from fever, frequent dizziness or shortness of breath.
Gloves and other disposable items must be placed in hospital garbage bags, contaminated surfaces must be cleaned and disinfected after work. For commercial shipment, including transportation by cruise ship and other passenger vessels, risk control includes such things as travel disruption in case of illness, self-absorption and immediate notification to the ship's medical center in case of fever or other symptoms while on board.
Ideally, treatment should be followed in the quarters of the person who is stricken. The CDC recommends that schools and child care centers be closed for a short period of time for the purpose of cleaning and disinfection, regardless of the extent of the disease spread at the community level, as an infected person may have been present in the school building.
When the rate of social transmission is low or moderate, social distancing strategies such as cancelling social gatherings, social gatherings and other gatherings such as attendance training or singing classes or eating in cafes, increasing the distance between tables, changing start and end times, limiting unnecessary customer attendance and using a separate sanitary office for children with flu-like symptoms can be helped.
When there is significant transition in the local community, in addition to social distancing strategies, long-term school holidays should be considered. The CDC believes there are few direct health risks to law enforcement personnel who carry out their daily activities.
Law enforcement officers who must be in contact with people who are ill or suspected of COVID-19 are advised to follow similar procedures to medical emergency technicians, including using appropriate personal protective equipment.
If a close contact occurs during a period of fear of illness, employees should wear their seat belts and tools clean and disinfected before reusing them with spray or household towels, and follow the working standards for the maintenance and disposal of used PPE and the maintenance and washing of dirty clothing.
OSHA believes that some specialists in health care and hospitality are classified as high-risk or high-risk occupations.
Risk-taking jobs such as providing healthcare, support, laboratory and medical transportation personnel are those exposed to patients infected or suspected of COVID-19.
If staff use aerosol-producing procedures, or take samples from suspected or infected COVID-19 patients, they have a very high risk of transmission.
These include aerosol-producing procedures, including tubing, surgical procedures, bronchoscopy, some dental examinations and surgeries, or invasive sampling.
Coldroom jobs involve high-risk work where a person must prepare the bodies of people who are suspected or infected with COVID-19 after their death; if an autopsy is performed on a body, these tasks are considered high-risk jobs. Additional engineering controls for these risk groups should also be considered, including in the detention rooms for patients who are suspected or infected with COVID-19, especially when procedures for the production of aerosol are underway.
In some sanitary and refrigerated environments, special negative pressure air conditioners may be appropriate.
Samples must be transported in accordance with Biodifence Level 3 precautions.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that new patients be placed in separate waiting areas, depending on whether they are suspected of being infected with COVID-19. OSHA recommends that those working within 6 feet of patients or people suspected of SARS-CoV-2 and those who are carrying out aerosol-generated procedures wear medical masks in addition to other personal protective equipment.
In the United States, under a comprehensive respiratory protection program and a letter that includes face-to-face testing, practice, and medical examination, N95 respiratory masks that have received NIOSH approval or better samples must be used.
Other types of respirators can provide greater protection and improve the comfort of workers. The World Health Organization does not recommend supplemental coverage, as COVID-19 is a respiratory disease and is not transmitted mainly through the body's respiratory tract.
The World Health Organization recommends surgical masks for screening start-point personnel.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that those who collect, store, or transfer respiratory samples from COVID-19 patients without any Aerocel-based procedure use surgical masks, protective glasses, facial shields, cloaks, and gloves.
If an aerosol generated method is used, the surgical mask is replaced with an N95 or FFP2 mask.
Given the insufficient global supply of PPE, the World Health Organization recommends that the need for personal protective equipment be minimized through the following measures: trapping (remotely) PPE, placing physical barriers such as transparent screens, allowing access to COVID-19 patient rooms for those who directly participate in care, using PPE only for essential tasks, wearing a medical mask and not wearing it when caring for several patients with the same disease, monitoring and coordinating the supply chain of PPE, and finally encouraging unsigned ordinary people to wear masks.

Title: [Covid-19] Loosening the burden and preparing for the future
Date/time of delivery: 14 March 2020, 00:24 UTC
Licensing: CC0: which rights are not reserved
We see ourselves in an interesting situation this month.
The COVID-19 epidemic is what defines the global interconnectedness of human beings and our responsibilities to one another.
This is an unprecedented challenge, but we certainly know that our best response is to the sense of solidarity, cooperation and a committed social commitment that lies at the heart of this organization.
The compassion and care we have seen through email, phone calls and chat among all our colleagues shows how happy we are to work with such amazing people.
I am thankful for such fellow workers as you, and I am very proud of them.
Last week, a person shared their gratitude for our work with me.
They reminded me how important it is for the world to now turn to Wikipedia and how powerful it is to stay online and be accessible to all for these critical resources.
Your efforts will help achieve this, whether it's helping sites keep up or helping colleagues get their paychecks or keeping our community safe.
Now more than ever, the world needs the information that Wikipedia provides.
Now is the moment when not only what we do, but how we do it will have a meaningful impact on the world.
Due to the importance of this mission and your role in it, there will be several significant changes in the way we work together from next week.
Our work transformations and schedule
As Robin mentioned earlier, the members of Team C met last night to discuss and exchange views on our approach and timing for the coming days and months.
In this conversation, we considered issues that we thought were the right answer to the problem we were facing and would be the best way to maintain effective and sustainable company efficiency.
We want to remove the tension and support our mission in the long run.
If you need to call again, that's fine.
For all employees, contractors and contract staff:
Until secondary notice, our daily work forecast will be about 4 hours per day or 20 hours per week.
We will not declare a state of shutdown - if you are able to work longer hours as normal, the mission can benefit from your assistance.
However, the world is already unpredictable and whether you need to provide care and food for your loved ones or visit a doctor, your well-being is our priority.
We're not recording your time.
If you are sick, do not work.
There is no need to mention this, but we will mention it again.
No supervisory leave or PTO is required - just tell your manager and help your team review calendars and timetables to make sure important areas of work are covered.
(If your COVID-19 test result is declared positive, please notify Brian at T&amp;C Ops so that T&amp;C can assist you with support and ensure that management takes care of your situation adequately).
The salaries of people who work on an hourly basis will be supplemented.
We have already stated and are committed once again to respecting our commitments to our contractors and hourly partners.
Everyone should be paid a salary in accordance with normal working hours under normal conditions.
If you are sick and unable to work, this includes you.
If you want to work, we support you.
Many people use work as a way to challenge their stress with the world around them.
What we do can be incredibly valuable, especially at times like this when we're in it.
Again, this is about taking care of yourself.
We ask that you contact your manager, so we know what to expect and can adjust accordingly.
Some tasks are considered essential.
There are things we still have to do.
SRE, HR Ops, Trust & Safety and fundraising teams (among others) are doing critical work that may require further support.
We will begin a process across all units to assess current objectives and focus on supporting whatever is necessary to accomplish this mission.
There is a lot of work to do, we will focus only on the most important projects.
Lowering the pace of work now will not cause further damage.
"We do not intend to 'double' the time when the pandemic is over to make up for the delay".
You will not be expected to work harder to reach deadlines that are now unreasonable.
We accept that the circumstances have changed and will take action if necessary to set new goals and timelines.
What happens to the APP?
To adapt to the reality and expectations of the new day, we intend to turn the timeline for delivering our 2020-2021 annual plan.
We plan to expand our 2019-2020 program to allow employees to prioritize basic tasks, caring for themselves and their loved ones, while those who need or are willing to work have a lighter work schedule over the next few weeks.
This extension of the timeline reduces the current workload for planning and the overall pressure on the organization.
We will present our proposal to the Board next week and will update the delegates and teams on the next steps once they are approved.
We thank the APP team for their leadership.
Situation, level of risk and cleanliness at work
Last week we learned that one of our resident staff at SF was likely exposed to the COVID-19 virus.
However, due to precautionary measures, we employed an anti-virus cleaning crew to disinfect all surfaces in the San Francisco office.
They used a hospital antiviral solution to disinfect all surfaces as well as lobbies and lofts that were connected to the ground floor.
The building implements its own protocol of care by using products that protect its occupants.
We feel comfortable that the office will be fully prepared for our return.
Our DC office is located in WeWork, which has shared its COVID-19 protocol with us and all DC resident employees.
Last week, our DC office became a completely remote practice, in accordance with guidelines shared with San Francisco.
As some of our colleagues in New York City know, we are negotiating a rental in Brooklyn.
These discussions are ongoing but may be delayed.
Some of our colleagues experience remote sensing for the first time.
Our long-term remote workers should be aware that conversions may occur, and I felt the need to make a few suggestions:
The duration of the sessions shall be limited to a maximum of one or two hours.
If longer sessions are needed, consider splitting the meeting and holding it in a few days.
Defining the meeting clearly, having a meeting schedule and submitting the material to be read in advance.
Make video calling a default for ease of collaboration and live communication with tools like Google Docs and Zoom.
In all meetings, a leader is someone who monitors the conversation about questions and follows the list of people who are speaking and has someone to take notes (or collaborate on taking notes).
If you need a comfortable headset, email the technical support department.
Use your welfare refund to buy snacks.
Join the Slack channel #remoties and talk to your colleagues about work distribution.
The Human Resources Operations Team will review the ergonomics and seminar-oriented guidance to support increased work distribution across the foundation.
Last week, we asked all recipients of social assistance to cancel public events supported by Wikimedia funds, such as the EIT, until the end of the pandemic is declared by the World Health Organization.
We inform them that we understand that your request for cancellation and other restrictions may make it impossible to complete the agreed grant activities and that no one will be penalized for delaying or converting those objectives.
Next week, we will provide more guidance on Wikimania and other local and thematic social conferences.
It is apparent that the world's population is unhappy with the break but is relieved that they can focus on their social activities, Wiki media and other activities with transparency.
CRT is taking a step forward, working to create a page on Meta-Wiki to provide a space for the community to monitor the impact and monitor our interaction with them.
Stay up to date on COVID-19 issues
We will send an invitation for a special staff meeting next Thursday at 14:00 GMT at 07:00 PT.
We will use this opportunity to share additional information, answer your questions and contact each other.
We are stuck in this situation together and we are ready to help in any way we can.
In this distance, you can also find information via this email and visit the Office Wiki for all other essential information about COVID-19.
CRT helps to reconstruct these pages and keep all information together.
We also make every effort to stay in regular contact with staff in the worst affected countries.
If you have any questions about travel, events, a mainstream workflow, or coverage challenges, or any other issues that you need help with, please promptly notify and cooperate with CRT.
We are available to assist in providing support and communication, as needed.
If you are aware of a sensitive or confidential matter, please email Bryan Judan, Director of Global International HR Operations.
None of these conversions should be considered as a quit of work or commitments.
Rather, they are already showing that our work and commitments must be adapted to a new way that has never been experienced before.
These are the stages that we believe are essential to continue to support each other, to inject the support that needs to be given to our movement and to support the world that depends on it.
Our planned work awaits us at the right time.
Now is the time to support each other and create space for important things to do in the weeks and possibly months ahead.
We need all of you to do this, and so we want all of you to take care of yourself and your family to be in the best possible position when needed.
Now, please -- wash your hands and do not touch your face!

ACE2 counters the activity of the angiotensin-converting enzyme by reducing the amount of angiotensin 2 and increasing the amount of angiotensin (-1-7), making it an effective medicinal target for the treatment of cardiovascular disease. ACE2 also acts as a cell entry point for some coronaviruses.
The human version of the enzyme is often called hACE2.
The angiotensin-2 converting enzyme contains a metalanzyme with a peptide element that is located on the surface of the internal and external cells.
The ACE2 protein contains the M2 peptidease-in-terminal domain and the C-terminal low-cholesterol amino acid carrier domain.
ACE2 is a type of single-pass membrane protein with an enzyme-specific active domain located on the cell surface in the lungs and other tissues.
The outer domain of the ACE2 cell is cleaved by another enzyme called the translucent domain of the thyroid gland, and the protein obtained is released into the bloodstream and eventually excreted in the urine.
ACE2 is present in most organs: ACE2 binds to the membrane of cells, mainly cavity-forming lung cells, small intestinal enterocytes, vascular endothelial cells, and smooth muscle cells of arteries in most organs.
ACE2 mRNA is also found in the cerebral cortex, the stratum cortex, the hypothalamus, and the brain stem.
The main function of ACE2 is to act as an ACE-equivalent antibody.
ACE divides angiotensin one into angiotensin two, which is a vascular inhibitor.
ACE2 instead separates the carboxylic-terminal amino acid phenylalanine from angiotensin two (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe) and hydrolyzes it into the angiotensin widener (1-7), H-Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-OH.
ACE2 can cause the cleavage of a number of other peptides including /DS-Arg9)-Bridicene, Neurotensin, Dinorphine A, and Grelin.
ACE2 also regulates the passage of neutral amino acid carriers SLC6A19 from the gland and plays a role in heart disease.
ACE2 acts as a membrane-mediated protein, as the main entry point into cells for some coronaviruses, including HCoV-NL63 (the virus that causes SARS) and SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19).
Specifically, the attachment of the S1 spike protein in SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 to the ACE2 enzyme domain on the cell surface leads to endocytosis and the transfer of both virus and enzyme to endosomes in cells.
This entry process also requires the preparation of the protein S by the TMPRSS2 serine protease host, whose inhibition as a potential treatment is under review. This led to the hypothesis that decreased ACE2 levels in cells may help to combat infection.
However, several oral societies and surveillance institutions have recommended the continuation of ACE inhibitor and ARB treatment.
"A preliminary review and meta-analysis published on July 11, 2012, found that ""the use of ACE inhibitors was associated with a significant 34 percent reduction in the risk of pneumonia (pneumonia) compared to controls""".
"In addition, ""the risk of chest and neck injury has also been reduced in patients treated with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, patients who were at higher risk for chest and neck injury, especially patients with stroke and heart failure".
"The use of ACE inhibitors was also associated with a decrease in deaths from breast and knee injuries, although the results were less potent than the overall risk of breast and knee injuries".
Human nootropic ACE2 (rhACE2) is a novel treatment for acute lung injury and has been shown to improve lung homodynamics and oxygen saturation in pigs with lipopolysaccharide-induced acute respiratory distress syndrome.
The half-life of rhACE2 in humans is about 10 hours and the onset of action is 30 minutes plus an impact period of 24 hours.
Various findings suggest that rhACE2 may be a promising drug for those who are resistant to the classical inhibitors of the renin-angiotance system (RAS inhibitors) or in patients with long-term angiotance II. RhACE2 injection has been studied in clinical studies for the treatment of acute respiratory dystrophy syndrome.
"Covid-19 B programs are mobile phone software programs designed to help track contacts in response to the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic, i.e. the process of identifying individuals (""touchers") who may have been in contact with an infected person".
Many applications were offered or developed with official government support in some regions and territories.
Several frameworks have been created to create communication tracking applications.
There have been concerns about privacy, particularly about systems that work based on tracking the geographic location of mobile users.
Less intrusive options include using Bluetooth signals to record user proximity to other mobile phones.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple jointly announced that they would install the capability to support these Bluetooth-based applications directly on Android and iOS operating systems.
In China, the Chinese government, in collaboration with Alipay, has implemented a program that allows citizens to check whether they have been in contact with people infected with COVID-19.
It is used in over 200 cities in China. In Singapore, a soft drink called Tris Togder is used.
"The app was developed by the local Information Technology Association, published as open text and delivered to the government. North Macedonia launched a mobile app called ""StopKorona!"", based on Bluetooth, to track contacts with potentially infected people, which allows for a quick response for health authorities".
The software was developed by the Ministry of Communications and Technology and the Ministry of Health.
As of April 14, 2020, the app is awaiting approval from the Google Play Store and Apple App Store.
"On April 12, the government stated that the audience tracking program is in an advanced stage of development and will be available for deployment in a few weeks. A similar program is also planned in Ireland and France ("StopCovid"")".
Australia and New Zealand are considering developing a software based on the Singaporean Tigress Tigress software and the Bluetooth protocol. Russia intends to design its geographic barrier software for COVID-19 positive patients living in Moscow to ensure they do not leave their homes.
Ross Anderson, professor of security engineering at the University of Cambridge, has listed a number of potential practical problems in program-based systems, including false positives and inefficiencies if the program is used only for a small portion of the population.
"Apple has imposed restrictions on organizations that can add coronavirus-related apps to the App Store app store, addressing concerns about the spread of misleading or malicious 'coronavirus' apps, limiting this to only 'official' or authoritative organisations".
Google and Amazon have implemented similar restrictions.
Privacy activists expressed concern about the use of crowd-sourced surveillance using coronavirus programs, especially regarding the dismantling of surveillance infrastructure created to combat the coronavirus pandemic after the threat of the virus was eliminated.
Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations issued a statement calling for restrictions on this type of surveillance.
The organizations announced eight conditions for government projects:
"Sorveillance must be ""legal, necessary and proportionate"";
The expansion of surveillance and surveillance must be subject to the end of history;
The use of data should be limited to the purposes of COVID-19.
Data security and anonymity must be maintained and this protection must be demonstrated on the basis of evidence.
Digital surveillance should not be discriminatory and marginalised.
Any sharing of data with third parties must be defined in law;
There must be protections against abuse and civil rights to respond to abuse.
"Significant collaboration will be required by all relevant stakeholders, including public health experts and marginalized groups. The German Computer Club of Chaos (CCC) and Reporters Without Borders (RSF) have also published a checklist".
Google/Apple's proposed plan intends to address the problem of ongoing surveillance by removing tracking mechanisms from their device's operating system when they are no longer needed.
Some countries use network-based location tracking instead of apps, eliminating the need to download an app and avoid tracking.
In Israel, network-based tracking was confirmed.
Network-based solutions that access raw location data have potential privacy issues.
However, not all systems with central servers require access to personal location data. A number of privacy systems have been created that use central servers only for two-way communications (see section below).
In South Korea, a non-program-based system was used to conduct call tracking.
Instead of using a dedicated application, the system collects tracking information from a variety of sources, including mobile tracking data and card transaction data, and combines these to generate alerts via text messages to people suspected of infection.
In addition to using this information to alert potential audiences, the government has made location information publicly available, which was allowed due to widespread changes in privacy laws following the outbreak of MERS in that country.
This information is made publicly available through a number of applications and websites. Countries such as Germany have considered the use of centralized systems and privacy safeguards.
As of 6 April 2020, details of the year had not been released.
Privacy-related call tracking is a credible idea that has been the subject of countless research since at least 2013. As of April 7, 2020, more than a dozen groups of experts are working on appropriate privacy-related solutions, such as using low-power Bluetooth (BLE) to record user proximity to other mobile phones.
However, PEPP-PT is a coordination effort that includes both centralized and decentralized approaches and is not a single protocol. Decentralized protocols include privacy-enabled tracking (DP-PPT/DP-3T), TCN temporary call counting, fka call event counting, CEN), privacy-sensitive protocols, and mobile phone tracking mechanisms (PACT), among others.
In these protocols, identifiable personal data never leaves the car and all tracking takes place in the car.
The privacy group at MIT Media Lab is developing SafePaths, a platform that uses privacy techniques when collecting and using location or cross-track data to track COVID-19 outbreaks.
"It is based on research from the white paper ""Apps Gone Rogue: Privacy in the Time of the Epidemic"" published in March 2020. Another similar effort is SafeTrace platform by Enigma MPC, a company that is developing privacy technologies that were originally developed in MIT Media's lab".
SafeTrace uses secure hardware technologies to allow users to share sensitive data about their location and integrity with other users and authorities without compromising their privacy.
On April 5, 2020, the Global TCN Alliance was formed by groups that were based around what were essentially the same approach and broad-based protocols, with the aim of reducing multilateralism and creating a global collaboration capability in tracking and alert programs - a key aspect to achieving broad acceptance.
On 9 April 2020, the Singapore government announced that it had made the BlueTrace protocol used in the government's official software open source.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple, the companies that control mobile phones for Android and iOS operating systems, announced an innovation for audience tracking based on a combination of low-power Bluetooth technology and privacy-keeping encryption, which they claim is a privacy safeguard.
They also published specifications for the central technologies used in the system.
According to Apple and Google, the system is planned to be expanded in three phases:
The release of new tools to empower governments to create official privacy-friendly coronavirus tracking programs.
Direct integration of this functionality into iOS and Android; Google and Apple plan to distribute the system first through the operating system's surveillance tool and then remove it in the same way after the risk is transferred.
Reuse of a drug b (also known as reused conversion drug, reprofiling, reuse or re-treated conversion) is the reuse of an approved drug to treat a disease or medical condition different from what the drug was originally designed for.
This is a front of scientific research that is currently being pursued to develop safe and effective COVID-19 treatments.
Other areas of research include the development of a COVID-19 vaccine and improved human plasma injection. SARS-CoV-2 has 66 proteins that have drug-developing potential against them, each with multiple ligand binding sites.
The analysis of these binding sites will lead to a reasonable project to produce effective antiviral drugs against COVID-19 proteins.
The most important target proteins of SARS-CoV-2 are papine-like proteases, RNA-dependent RNA polymerases, helicazes, S (S) proteins, and ribophosphatase ADP.
Hussein A.A. and colleagues studied several sample compositions and optimized and analyzed them for their structural similarity to similar drugs with the highest approval rate in order to accelerate the development of the SARS-CoV-2 anti-virus drug in their preclinical study, which is recommended in a clinical study design.

This treatment has not been approved by the FDA for clinical trials and is only approved as an experimental treatment for emergency treatment in patients who are hospitalized and unable to receive treatment in a clinical trial.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has said that ""the use, dose, or duration of hydroxychloroquine for the prevention or treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection has not been established".
"Doctors have said they use the drug when ""there is no other option""".
The Turkish research team at Valitbol is conducting research on the use of chlorinoquin in combination with vitamin A, vitamin C and vitamin D.
Extensive studies are underway at Duke University and Oxford University.
NYU Langone Medical School is conducting an experiment on the safety and efficacy of the preventive use of hydroxychloroquine.
"Chinese clinical studies in Wuhan and Shenzhen claimed that Fawai Piraweir was ""completely effective"".
On average, 35 patients tested negative for 4 days, while the duration of the disease was 11 days in 45 patients who did not receive it.
In a study in Wuhan of more than 240 patients with breast and knee injuries, half of the people received Favipiravir and half received omephenovir.

"A study on Lupinvir/Ritonavir (Caltra), a combination of Lupinvir and Ritonavir antiviruses, concluded that ""no benefit was observed""".
These drugs are designed to inhibit the propagation of HIV via a protease-binding agent.
A team of researchers from the University of Colorado is working to modify the drug and find a combination that would link it to the SARS-CoV-2 protease. There is criticism in the scientific community about directing resources towards the conversion of psychoactive drugs, especially drugs produced for AIDS.
The World Health Organization has included Lupinvir/Retinavir in a joint international trial.
Remdesivir was developed and developed by Gilead Sciences as a treatment for Ebola virus disease and Marburg virus infection. Later, Gilead Sciences discovered that remdesivir had antiviral activity in inland conditions against multiple viruses, including the philo, nano, paramexo and coronaviruses.
One problem with antiviral therapy is to create resistance to the effects of mutations that can lead to disease and more severe transmission.
Some early pre-test studies suggest that remdesivir may have a high genetic barrier to resistance. Several clinical studies are underway, including two conducted by Cleveland University Hospitals; one for people with mild disease levels and one for patients with severe disease levels.
Three clinical trials are underway to inject vitamin C into hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19 conditions; two controlled placebo trials (China, Canada) and one uncontrolled trial (Italy).
New York State began testing the antibiotic azithromycin on March 24, 2020.

Researchers at the Montreal Heart Institute in Canada are currently studying the role of calcisine in reducing inflammation and lung problems in patients suffering from mild symptoms of COVID-19.
The study, called Colcorona Toxicity (COLCORONA), used 6,000 adults aged 40 and older who had been diagnosed with COVID-19 but experienced mild symptoms of the disease that did not require hospitalization.
Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding or do not use an effective method of contraception are not eligible.
Several anti-inflammatory agents have been tested in Italy.
Heparin is widely used to treat patients due to its low molecular weight and has led the Italian Medicinal and Medical Agency to publish guidelines on its use.
A multi-centered study of over 300 patients investigating the use of sodium anoxaparin in preventive and therapeutic doses was announced on April 14 in Italy.
Since SARS-CoV-2 is a virus, significant scientific attention has been paid to the use of approved antiviral drugs that have been approved for previous outbreaks of viruses such as SARS, MERS and West Nile virus.
Revavirin: Revavirin is recommended for the treatment of COVID-19 according to the seventh edition of the Chinese guidelines
Omfenowire: According to the seventh edition of the Chinese guidelines, Omfenowire is recommended for the treatment of COVID-19.
Some antibiotics that are known to be potential treatments for COVID-19 include:
Tocilizomb (anti-IL-6 receptor): Approved by China.
Tests were also conducted in Italy and China and you can see Tosilizomab #COVID-19.
The COVID-19 vaccine is a vaccine based on a hypothesis against the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
Although no vaccine has completed clinical studies, numerous efforts are underway to develop such a vaccine.
In late February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced that it does not expect a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 to be available in less than 18 months.
Five proposed vaccines were in Phase I safety studies in April.
COVID-19 was diagnosed in December 2019.
A major worldwide outbreak in 2020, which led to significant investment and research activities to develop a vaccine.
Many organizations use published genomes to develop potential vaccines to combat SARS-CoV-2.
As stated in April, CEPI's guidelines for vaccine development include: speed, production capacity, scale expansion and global access.
In April, CEPI scientists reported that 10 different technology platforms were under research and development in early 2020 to develop an effective COVID-19 vaccine.
The main objectives of the platform, which has progressed in the first phase of immunity studies, include:
Nucleic acid (DNA and RNA) (stage one expansion and vaccine candidate: Moderna, mRNA-1273)
Viral carrier (developer phase one and proposed vaccine: CanSino Biologics, adeno-virus carrier type 5)
According to the Alliance for Epidemic Preparedness Innovation (CEPI) scientists in April, there are 115 vaccine samples in the early stages of development, with 78 approved as active projects (79, according to the Milken Institute) and 37 other vaccines, but little information is available to the public (assuming they are in the planning or design phase).
Phase I-II testing tests initial immunity and immunity development and is generally randomized and placebo-controlled and is performed in several locations, while identifying a more effective and accurate dose.
Phase 3 trials typically involve more participants, including a control group and the effectiveness of vaccine prevention trials as well as monitoring adverse reactions at the desired dose.
"Of the 79 proposed vaccines in active development (approved in early April 2020), 74 have not yet reached the human evaluation stage (still in ""preclinical"" research)".

In March 2020, the government, industry and three US universities will share the resources needed to access IBM's supercomputers, along with cloud computing resources from Holt Packard, Amazon, Microsoft and Google.
Some vaccines have non-homogeneous effects, also called non-specific effects.
This means that they can have benefits beyond disease prevention.
Another randomized trial in Australia is looking to register 4,170 health and medical personnel.
It is possible that developing vaccines may not be safe or effective.
Initial research to assess the efficacy of vaccines using specific animal models of COVID-19, namely transgenic-ACE2 mice, other laboratory animals and non-human mammals, suggests the need for Level 3 biosecurity measures to control live viruses and international coordination to ensure standardised immunity procedures.
SARS and MERS vaccines have been tested on animal samples.
As of 2020, there is no preventive treatment or vaccine for SARS that has been shown to be both safe and effective in humans.
According to articles published in 2005 or 2006, the introduction and development of new vaccines and medicines for the treatment of SARS was a priority for governments and public health agencies around the world.
When MERS became widespread, it was believed that existing research on SARS might provide a useful model for developing a vaccine and treating MERS-CoV infection.
As of March 2020, there was one MERS (DNA-based) vaccine that completed Phase I clinical studies and three others are underway, all viral vector vaccines, two adenoviral vectors (ChAdOx1-MERS, BVRS-GamVac) and one MVA vector (MVA-MERS-S).
Social media posts have promoted a conspiracy theory that claims the COVID-19 virus is known to cause and that a vaccine is already available.
Patents referenced by various social media posts refer to patents available for genetic sequences and vaccines for other types of coronavirus such as SARS.
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by the acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Common symptoms include fever, cough, and shortness of breath.
Other symptoms may include fatigue, muscle pain, diarrhea, sore throat, loss of sense of smell, and abdominal pain.
It usually takes about 5 days from exposure to the virus to the onset of symptoms, but may vary from two to fourteen days.
Although the majority of cases have mild symptoms, some have viral chest and wrist and multiple organ failure.
As of April 17, 2020, more than 2.24 million cases have been reported in 210 countries and regions, resulting in more than 153,000 deaths.
An additional 568,000 people were cured. The virus was initially spread to people through direct contact, usually with the following drops of coughing, thirst or sneezing.
When these droplets are produced during the sphincter, they usually stick to the ground or to surfaces rather than being moved over long distances.
People may become infected by touching an infected surface and then touching their eyes, nose or mouth.
The virus can survive on surfaces for up to 72 hours.
The disease is more contagious within the first three days after the onset of symptoms, although there may be a pre-existing outbreak and in later stages. The standard method of detecting the chain reaction agent is reverse transcriptional polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) of the bioavailable sub-anine.
The use of masks is recommended for people suspected of being infected with the virus and their caregivers.
Recommendations on public use of masks vary, with some authorities opposing the use of masks, some recommending and some enforcing it.
Currently, there is no specific vaccine or antiviral treatment for COVID-19.
Local transmission of the disease has been recorded in most countries in all six regions of the World Health Organization.
People infected with the virus may not have symptoms or show flu-like symptoms such as fever, cough, fatigue or shortness of breath.
Emergency symptoms include shortness of breath, pain or persistent pressure on the chest, dizziness, difficulty waking up and bleeding of the face or lips; if these symptoms are present, immediate medical attention is recommended.
Sometimes, symptoms of the respiratory system may be seen, such as nausea, runny nose or sore throat.
Symptoms related to digestion such as nausea, vomiting and diarrhea have been observed in different percentages.
Some patients in China had only a narrow chest and a coughing spleen.
In some people, the disease may lead to breast and elbow, multiple organ failure and death.
This period is called the incubation period.
The incubation period for COVID-19 is usually five to six days, but the transition period may vary between two to 14 days.
97.5% of people show symptoms up to 11.5 days after infection. Reports suggest that all infections do not necessarily have symptoms.
The role of these symptomless carriers in the transmission of influenza is not fully understood, although preliminary evidence suggests that they may play a role in the spread of the virus.
The proportion of infectious cases that do not show symptoms is currently unknown and under study, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC), 20% of all confirmed cases remained symptomless during hospitalization.
The National Health Commission of China began to include symptomless cases in its daily case statistics from April 1. Of the 166 infections that day, 130 (78%) were symptomless at the time of the test.
Both mouth ulcers and mouth ulcers are a major cause of disease.
Speaking out loud produces more small drops than normal speech.
A study in Singapore found that a surfacing without a protector can lead to breathing droplets dropped up to 4.5 metres (15 ft) away.
Although the virus is not generally suspended in the air, the National Academy of Sciences said transmission is possible through this medium and samples from people's outdoor air samples also showed positive viral RNA.
Some medical procedures such as tubing and pulmonary resuscitation (CPR) may cause respiratory filtration to spread through the air, resulting in air discharge.
Although there are concerns that the disease is also transmitted by the presence of a host, the likelihood of it is very low. The most contagious condition is when a person has symptoms, although transmission before symptoms are manifested is possible but very unlikely.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control says that while the ease of transmission is not entirely clear, one person can infect two to three others.
In particular, the virus has been detectable for up to one day on a casing, more than thirty days on plastic (polypropylene) and stainless steel (AISI 304) and more than four hours on copper for up to 99%.
However, this varies depending on humidity and temperature.
Both soap and detergent are useful if used properly: soap products remove and disable the virus's protective candle layer, as well as isolate the virus from the skin and other surfaces.
Other solutions such as benzalkonium chloride and chloride gluconate (an surgical disinfectant) are less effective. In a study in Hong Kong, saliva samples were taken at medium intervals of two days after admission.
In five of the six cases, the first sample had the highest viral load and the sixth highest viral load on day two.
Acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2) is a novel respiratory syndrome that was first observed in three people with breast and knee injuries in the womb who suffered from blood oxygen loss and respiratory problems.
All of the features of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus are present in the coronavirus relatives in nature.
Outside the human body, the virus is killed with ordinary soap, which destroys the retaining bubble in the produced floors. COVID-19 is closely related to SARS-CoV-2.
The lungs are the most susceptible to COVID-19, as the angiotensin-converting enzyme-converting virus 2 (ACE2) enters the host cells, the most abundant receptor in two-lung allele cells.
"The virus is used to bind to ACE2 and enter the host cell, a specific glycoprotein (pollomer) called a ""spike"" (spike)".
In 12% of mental illness cases in hospitals in Wuhan, China, acute heart failure was found, which is more common in acute illness.
The rate of cardiovascular disease is variable due to inflammatory response and immune system disorders during the course of the disease, but heart muscle damage may be related to ACE2 receptors in the heart.
ACE2 receptors are highly expressed in the heart and share the function of the heart.
High prevalence of thrombosis (31%) and varicose vein thromboembolic (25%) has been observed in ICU patients with COVID-19 and may be related to poor prognosis. Autopsies of people who died from COVID-19 indicate widespread aloeutic decay (DAD) and inflammatory disorders involving lymphocytes in the lungs.
Although SARS-CoV-2 tends to be expressed in ACE2 expressed in mucous cells, patients with severe COVID-19 are showing symptoms of general hyperinflammation.
In particular, pathogenic T cells that filter GM-CM have been shown to be associated with the use of inflammatory monocytes that filter IL-6 and severe lung pathology among COVID-19 patients.
A lymphocytic arm has also been reported in autopsy.
The World Health Organization has published several testing protocols for the disease.
The standard test method is the reverse transcriptional polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR).
The test is usually performed on breath samples obtained from the salivary gland; however, nasal gland or salivary gland samples may also be used.
Results are usually available within a few hours to two days.
Blood tests can be used, but two blood samples are required to be taken within two weeks of each other and the results are of low momentum value.
Chinese scientists were able to isolate a strain of the coronavirus and release a genetic sequence, so laboratories around the world could independently develop a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to detect infections based on the virus.
As of April 4, 2020, antibody testing (which can detect active infections and whether a person has been infected in the past) was in development, but has not been widely used since.
Chinese experimentation of the test showed that its accuracy is 60 to 70 percent.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved the first point of care test in the United States on March 21, 2020, for use later that month. Diagnostic procedures published by the Women's Hospital of Wuhan University suggested methods for detecting infections based on clinical features and infectious diseases.
Bipolar glass matte deposits are common with an ambiguous, uneven, and alternating distribution in early infection.
Pulmonary congestion, abnormal structures (thickening of the spleen and variable filling of the air sacs) and pulmonary density are signs of disease progression.
Little information is available on the microscopic and pathophysiological impairments of COVID-19.
The main pathological findings of autopsy include:
Macroscopy: fluoride, amnesia of the heart, pulmonary stabilization and human retention
There are four types of viral chest and wrist severity:
Mild breast and wrist: pulmonary ulcers, hyperplasia of the pneumocyte, large atypical pneumocyte, inflammation of the eye with lymphatic artery and formation of a large, large, large cell
Severe pneumonia: A widespread aloecular injury (DAD) with aloecular exodate.
DAD is the cause of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and decreased blood oxygen levels.
Chest and wrist treatment: preparation of the filtration in the cavities of the air sacs and fibrosis of the ribs
Blood: extensive vascular coagulation (DIC); leukoroblastic reaction
Preventive measures to reduce the risk of infection include staying at home, avoiding crowded places, washing hands regularly with soap and water, maintaining good breathing for at least 20 seconds, and avoiding touching the eyes, nose or mouth with your hands.
The CDC recommends that you cover your mouth and nose with a towel when coughing or sneezing, and cough or sneez around your neck if no one else is available.
Hand hygiene is recommended after coughing or sneezing.
To limit the transmission of disease by people with no symptoms, the CDC has recommended the use of face coverings in public gatherings. Social distancing strategies aim to reduce contact with the population by closing schools and workplaces, restricting travel and cancelling large public gatherings.
Distancing procedures also include keeping people at least 6 feet (1.8 meters) apart.
"There is no known effective vaccine for COVID-19 prevention. Since the shortest possible time to get vaccinated will not be earlier than 2021, a key issue in COVID-19 control is the effort to reduce the epidemic, or so-called ""curve clearance"".
The CDC also recommends that people wash their hands for 20 seconds, especially after going to the bathroom or when their hands are clearly dirty, before eating or after cleaning their noses, after coughing and sneezing.
In addition, it is recommended that consumers consume alcohol with at least 60% alcohol, but only when soap and water are not readily available. WHO offers two formulations for local production for areas where commercial hand sanitizers are not readily available.
In this formula, antimicrobial activity is due to ethanol or isopropanol.
"Hydrogen proxide is used to help eliminate bacterial spores in alcohol. ""It is not an active hand sanitizer""".
Glycerol was added as a moisture attractor.
People are subjected to supportive care, which may include fluid therapy, auxiliary oxygen and support for other vital organs.
The CDC recommends that people suspected of being carnivores wear a simple face mask.
External membrane oxygenation (ECMO) has been used to treat respiratory distress, but its benefits are currently being studied.
Personal hygiene and a healthy lifestyle and diet are recommended to improve the immune system.
Protective treatments may be effective for people with mild symptoms and early infection. The World Health Organization (WHO) and the Chinese National Health Commission (Chinese National Health Commission) have published recommendations for the care of people hospitalized for COVID-19.
Special care professionals and six specialists in the United States have compiled the recommendations of various agencies for therapists in a free resource, the IBCC.
As of April 2020, there is no specific treatment for COVID-19.
Some medical professionals prefer paracetamol for symptom-relieving purposes to ibuprofen for primary treatment.
To minimize the risk of transmission of the virus, precautions should be taken, especially in the treatment environment where particles may be produced during the processes, such as piping and manual respiration.
For healthcare professionals who care for people infected with COVID-19, the CDC recommends that, in addition to the use of precautionary measures, precautionary contact and airborne infection control, the person be placed in an airborne infection isolation room (AIIR).
Recommended accessories include: PPE gloves, respiratory systems or face masks, eye protection and medical gloves. If available, respirators (instead of face masks) are preferred.
N95 respiratory filters are approved for industrial use, but the FDA has only issued approval for use in an approved emergency use (EUA) situation.
They are designed to protect particles suspended in air such as dust, but their effectiveness against a specific biological agent for uses not listed on the label is not guaranteed.
The CDC recommends the use of face protectors, or as a last resort, home masks when masks are not available.
Most cases of COVID-19 are not serious enough to require mechanical or similar respiration, but a percentage of those affected require these conditions.
The type of respiratory aid that patients with COVID-19 respiratory failure need is currently being studied in people in hospitals, and evidence has shown that intravenous or respiratory tubing can be prevented by using a high-pressure or semi-positive air pressure tube.
It is unknown which of the two results in the same benefit for people who are severely ill.
Some doctors prefer to continue with an aggressive mechanical ventilator at the time of access, as this technique limits the spread of airborne particles compared to treatment with long-flow nasal conolate oxygen. Acute cases are most common in people over the age of 60 and especially those over the age of 80.
Many developed countries do not have adequate hospitals, which limits the capacity of a health system to handle the sudden rise in the number of COVID-19 cases that are urgently needed in hospitals.
A study in China found that 5% were admitted to special care wards, 2.3% needed mechanical artificial respiratory assistance, and 1.4% lost their lives.
In China, about 30% of people who went to hospital for COVID-19 were admitted to ICU.
Mechanical ventilation becomes more complex as acute respiratory syndrome (ARDS) progresses in COVID-19 and oxygen delivery becomes increasingly difficult.
Ventilators, including high pressure control modes and PEEP, are used to maximize oxygen delivery while reducing the risk of respiratory and pneumococcal injury.
Updated PEEPs may not be available in older ventilators.
Research into potential therapies began in January 2020 and several antiviral drugs are being seen in clinical studies.
Ramsayer has been the most effective case so far.
Although it may take until 2021 to develop new drugs, many drugs currently being tested have been proven for other uses or have already been approved in advanced trials.
Antiviral drugs may be tested on people with severe illness.
The World Health Organization has recommended that volunteers participate in trials to determine the efficacy and immunity of potential drugs. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has granted a temporary license for the use of convalescent plasma as an experimental treatment in cases where a person's life is seriously or directly threatened.
It has not been studied in clinical trials to demonstrate immunity and efficacy for disease.
In February 2020, China introduced a mobile software to combat the outbreak.
Users are asked to enter their name and identification number.
"This program uses surveillance data to detect ""close contact"" and consequently a potential risk of infection".
Each user can check the status of three other users.
If a potential risk is identified, the program recommends not only self-quarantine, but also a risk notification to local health officials. Big data analysis of mobile phone data, facial recognition technology, mobile phone tracking and artificial intelligence are used to track infected cases and people who have been in contact with South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore.
In March 2020, the Israeli government enabled security agencies to track phone information of people suspected of being infected with coronavirus.
The measure is to implement quarantine and protect people who may be in contact with infected citizens.
Also in March 2020, Deutsche Telekom shared shared location data with the German Federal Government Agency, the Robert Koch Institute, for the purpose of research and prevention of the spread of the virus.
Russia has implemented facial recognition technology to identify quarantine violators.
"Julio Galera, a member of the Italian Regional Health Board, said mobile operators have been informed that ""40% of people go back and forth anyway"."
The German government ran a recent 48-hour hackathon with more than 42,000 participants.
The President of Estonia, Kersti Kaljulaid, also called for innovative solutions to the spread of the coronavirus.
People in quarantine may experience anxiety, travel restrictions, side effects of treatment or fear of infection.
"The BBC, quoting Rory O'Connor, declared: ""More social trafficking, loneliness, anxiety about health, stress and the economic crisis are a storm in every sense to harm people's mental health and well-being"."
The disease may have a mild or even symptomless course and is similar to a normal symptomatic respiratory problem such as a normal fall.
Mild cases typically resolve within two weeks, while recovery may take three to six weeks in people with severe and serious illnesses.
Based on data from other similar viruses such as SARS and MS, pregnant women may be at higher risk of contracting COVID-19, except for the absence of data on COVID-19. In some people, COVID-19 may affect the lungs and cause chest and throat.
In severely infected individuals, COVID-19 may progress rapidly to acute respiratory syndrome (ARD), which leads to shortness of breath, septic shock, or multiple organ failure.
COVID-19-related problems include varicose veins, abnormal constipation, and damage to the heart, kidneys and liver.
Blood clotting disorders, or specifically an increase in prothrombin time, were seen in 6% of patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19, while abnormal functioning was seen in 4% of the group.
Approximately 20 to 30% of people infected with COVID-19 have high liver enzymes (trans aminases).
According to the same report, the average time between the onset of symptoms and death was ten days, five of which were in hospital status.
However, in patients admitted to the ICU, the average time between hospitalization and death was seven days.
In a study of high initial cases, the mean time from initial symptoms to death was 14 days, with a range of six to 41 days.
In a study conducted by the National Health Commission of China (NHC), the mortality rate for men was 2.8% compared to 1.7% for women.
Tissue studies of postmortem samples of the lungs show dispersed aloecular damage with cell fibromycin exodates in both lungs.
Viral cytopathic mutations have been observed in pneumocytes.
Image six was similar to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
In 11.8% of the deaths reported by the National Health Commission of China, the extent of heart damage due to high levels of troponin or cardiac arrest was considered.
According to March statistics, 89% of people hospitalized in the United States have had a concomitant illness. Availability of medical resources and the region's economy have not been ineffective in mortality.
Estimates of mortality from these conditions vary due to regional differences and due to methodological problems.
The lower number of mild cases causes the mortality rate to be overestimated.
However, the fact that deaths are caused by people who have been infected in the past could mean that the mortality rate is now estimated to be lower.
Smokers are 1.4 times more likely to experience severe symptoms of COVID-19 and are nearly 2.4 times more likely to require special care compared to non-smokers.
Hong Kong Hospital officials found a 20% to 30% decrease in lung capacity in the number of people recovering from the disease and lung scans showed organ damage.
This may also lead to post-special care syndrome.
Until March 2020, it was not clear whether previous infections in people recovering from the disease would cause effective and long-term immunity.
The immunity of people is likely due to the behaviour of other coronaviruses, but there have been reports of people who have not recovered from COVID-19 being infected again.
It is believed that these cases will worsen long-term infections rather than reinfection.
The virus is believed to be natural and to have animal origin and to have been transmitted through the viral infection.
The exact origin is unknown, but the spread of the infection until December 2019 was a complementary means of human-to-human transmission.
A study of 41 first confirmed cases of COVID-19, published in The Lancet in January 2020, announced the first date of onset of symptoms on 1 December 2019.
Official WHO records reported that the first signs of the disease were on December 8, 2019.
Several metrics are commonly used to calculate the mortality rate.
These figures vary by region and over time and vary by frequency of testing, quality of health care system, treatment options, time elapsed since the onset of outbreak, and demographic characteristics such as age, gender and overall health.
In late 2019, the World Health Organization assigned the ICD-10 Emergency Code of Disease U07.1 to the Fucus Fucus with SARS-CoV-2 infection that was laboratory-approved and the U07.2 Code for patients who died without laboratory-approved SARS-CoV-2 infection that were clinically or epidemiologically infected with COVID-19.
According to Johns Hopkins University statistics, the global death rate as of April 17, 2020 is 6.9% (153,822/2,240,191).
Other metrics include the mortality rate and mortality rate (CFR), which is the rate of people who were ill and died, and the infection mortality rate (IFR), which is the percentage of infectious cases (diagnosed or undiagnosed) that died from the disease.
These statistics are not time-limited and follow a specific population from infection to resolution.
Although not all patients produce antibodies, the presence of these antibodies in people indicates how many people have been infected.
In the centre of the outbreak in Italy, in a small village called Castiglione d'Adda, 80 people (1.7%) died of 4,600 inhabitants.
In Gangelet, the virus spread through carnival festivals and spread among young people, which reduced the mortality rate. However, not all COVID-19 deaths may be of this nature.
Furthermore, the German health system is not immune to the admission and treatment of patients.
In the Netherlands, an estimate of blood donors suggests that about 3% of people may have antibodies.
69 people (0.004% of the population) have lost their lives due to COVID-19.
The impact of the pandemic and the associated mortality rate varies for men and women.
The mortality rate among men is higher in studies conducted in China and Italy.
The highest risk for men was in their 50s, and the gap between men and women is only 90 percent.
In China, the mortality rate was 8.2% for men and 7.1% for women.
The root cause of this gender difference is unknown, but behavioral and genetic factors can be a factor.
Immunological differences based on gender, less prevalence of smoking in women and male exposure to similar diseases, such as hypertension at a younger age than women, can contribute to higher mortality in men.
In Europe, 57% of those infected were men and 72% of those who died from COVID-19 were also men.
As of April 2020, the US government no longer tracks data on COVID-19 transmission through sexual contact.
Research shows that viral diseases such as Ebola, AIDS, influenza and SARS have different effects on women and men.
A higher percentage of health workers, especially nurses, are women who are more likely to become infected with the virus.
"The World Health Organization announced on 11 February 2020 that the official name of the disease is ""COVID-19"" (COVID-19)".
WHO head Tedros Adhanom Gabrisos explained that CO is the origin of the word coronavirus, VI is the origin of the word virus and D is the origin of the word disease in English, and the 19 years of the first case of infection with the virus: 31 December 2019.
The virus was named according to the Global Nomenclature Guidelines for the Prevention of Disinfection, with the exception of a specific geographic area (e.g. China), or a specific species of animals or group of people.
"In addition, the World Health Organization uses the term ""COVID-19 virus"" or ""COVID-19-causing virus"" in public statements".
"Usually, ""coronavirus"" refers to both a virus and a disease".
"During the early outbreak of the virus in Wuhan, China, the virus and disease were commonly known as ""coronavirus"" and ""Wuhan coronavirus""".
In January 2020, the World Health Organization named the disease 2019-nCoV and acute respiratory disease 2019-nCoV, according to data published in 2015 to temporarily poison diseases and viruses by location.
The official names of COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 were published on 11 February 2020.
Due to capacity constraints in standard service supply chains, some digital factories are producing medical goods such as nose valves or ventilator parts.
For example, when a hospital in Italy was in urgent need of a ventilator valve and the supplier was unable to deliver it, a local startup with reverse engineering produced 100 valves in one night.
After the initial outbreak of COVID-19, conspiracy theories, false and misleading information about the origin, scale, prevention, treatment and other aspects of the disease emerged and quickly spread on the Internet.
It is estimated that humans are capable of transmitting the virus to a number of other animals.
Research has failed to find evidence of virus replication in pigs, ducks and rats.
No drug or vaccine has been approved for the treatment of the disease.
International research into vaccines and medicines for COVID-19 is being conducted by government agencies, scientific groups and industry researchers.
"In March, the World Health Organization launched a ""SOLIDARITY Trial"" to evaluate the therapeutic effects of four existing antiviral compounds with the highest hope of efficacy".
No vaccine is available, but various institutions are actively developing vaccine samples.
Because SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 both use ACE2 receptors to enter human cells, previous research on SARS-CoV is useful.
Three vaccination strategies have been explored in this area.
Initially, the goal of the researchers was to produce a complementary vaccine for the virus.
The use of such viruses, whether inactivated or dead, is intended to stimulate the rapid response of the human immune system to new infections with COVID-19.
The second strategy, sub-vaccines, aims to create a vaccine that will make the immune system sensitive to specific subunits of the virus.
In the case of SARS-CoV-2, research has focused on the S-spike protein that helps the virus bind to the ACE2 enzyme receptor.
The third strategy is also nucleic acid vaccines (RNA or DNA vaccines, a new technique for promoting vaccination).
Trial vaccines of each of these strategies must be tested for immunity and efficacy. On March 16, 2020, the first clinical trial of a vaccine with four volunteers began in Seattle.
The vaccine contains a harmless genetic code copied from a virus that causes the disease. Antibody-dependent improvement has been suggested as a potential challenge to develop a vaccine for SARS-COV-2, but this is controversial.
More than 300 active clinical trials are underway as of April 2020.
Seven trials for the treatment of malaria have already been evaluated, including four studies on hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine.
Newly functioning antiviral drugs account for the bulk of Chinese research, including nine Phase Three clinical trials on RMS in various countries in late April.
A dynamic clinical process for the development of a COVID-19 vaccine with the drugs designated for this purpose has been underway since April 2020. Several antiviral drugs available for the treatment of COVID-19 including remdesivir, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, lupinavir/retonavir and lupinavir/retonavir along with interferon beta are under investigation.
As of March 2020, there is experimental evidence of efficacy of remdesivir.
Clinical improvement was observed in patients treated with compassionate use of remdesvir.
Phase III clinical studies are underway in the United States, China, and Italy. Chlorokine, previously used to treat malaria, was studied with preliminary results in February 2020 in China.
However, there are calls for review by other researchers.
Health authorities in Korea and China recommend the use of chlorine.
However, the Wuhan Institute of Virology, while recommending a daily dose of one gram, notes that twice this dose is extremely dangerous and can be fatal.
On March 28, 2020, the FDA authorized the emergency use of hydrochloride and chlorokine for the treatment of COVID-19 patients. Chinese procedures of the Seventh Amendment include interferon, ribavirin or umifenovir for use against COVID-19.
Early data suggest that high doses of ribavirin are necessary for the prevention of SARS-CoV-2 in laboratory conditions.
After demonstrating a low-concentration inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2, nitasoxaneide is recommended for further study in the body. Studies have shown that the initial synthesis of spike protein with intramuscular serine proteinase 2 (TMPRSS2) is essential for entry of SARS-CoV-2 via the ACE2 receptor interaction.
Studies of high-chlorokine and hydroxychloroquine with or without azithromycin have numerous limitations that impede the medical community in accepting and testing these therapeutic practices without additional studies. Seltamivir does not inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in laboratory conditions and has no role in the treatment of COVID-19.
Cytocin storm could be a problem in the later stages of COVID-19.
There is evidence that hydroxychloroquine may have cytokine storm-fighting properties. Tocilizumab was included in the treatment guidelines after a brief study by the National Health Commission of China was completed.
After showing positive results in people with severe illness, it is undergoing a non-random Phase 2 trial at the national level of Italy.
Blood tests in combination with serum ferritin tests are used to detect cytokine storms, which are said to be the cause of death for many infected people.
Interleukin receptor antagonist 6 was approved by the FDA in 2017 for the treatment of steroid-resistant cytokine release syndrome due to a different cause, CAR T cell therapy, based on previous case studies.
To date, there is no random or controlled evidence that tosylizumab is an effective treatment for CRS.
Transmission of purified antibodies and antibodies collected from the immune system of people who have recovered from COVID-19 to infected cases is currently under review as a non-vaccine method.
This strategy was tested for SARS without definite results.
Viral neutralization is a predicted practical mechanism by which the treatment of passive antibodies can create a defense agent against SARS-CoV-2.
Of course, other mechanisms such as cytotoxicity and/or antibody-dependent cell phagocytosis are also possible.
Other types of passive antibody therapy, for example, the use of synthetic monoclonal antibodies, are being developed.
The production of serum from healthy individuals, which includes the fluid part of patients' blood that has been improved and contains specific antibodies to the virus, can be increased for faster use.
Coronavirus-related diseases, a group of highly related syndromes
Li Wenliang, a doctor at Wuhan Central Hospital, was later infected and passed away after being informed of the spread of the virus.
