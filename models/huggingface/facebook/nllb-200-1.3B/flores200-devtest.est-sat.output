The lowest ranking are medium-sized cats, which feed on medium-sized prey, starting with rabbits and ending with antelopes and goats.

The secret to their success is the concept of a niche, the specific job that each cat does, which keeps it from competing with the others.
Lions are the most social of cats, living in large groups, or packs.
The herds consist of one to three mated adult males and up to thirty females and pups.
The females are usually very close together, forming a large family of sisters and daughters.
lion herds act in many ways like wolf and dog herds, which are surprisingly similar to lions (but not to other big cats) and are also very deadly to their prey.
Tiger, a versatile athlete, can climb (but not well), swim, jump long distances, and pull with five times the force of a strong person.
The tiger is in the same group (Genus Panthera) as the lion, leopard, and jaguar, and these four only have the ability to roar.
The tiger's roar is not the roar of a lion, but rather the phrase of a phrase shouted out in a roar.
The great horned owl prefers to eat small animals, and when possible, they will hunt monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds, except for all the animals the great horned owl hunts that are considerably smaller than him.
Researchers believe that bats track and find prey (victims) by scent, by sniffing the places they've been.
They have excellent vision in the dark, and they are also very nimble, blending into their surroundings to hunt prey and then grabbing prey.
When a small group of organisms (a small population) separates from the main population from which they originate (e.g. they move across a mountain range or a river or move to a new island, and it is not easy to return), they often find themselves in a different environment than before.
The new environment has different resources and different competitors, so the new population needs different characteristics from those previously required and must adapt to be a strong competitor.
The original population hasn't changed at all, they still need the same adjustments as before.
As time goes by, as a new population adapts to their new environment, they become less and less like another population.
As a result, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will look so different that they cannot be called the same species.
we call this process species selection, which is simply the creation of a new species. is an inevitable consequence of evolution and a very important part of it.
Plants produce oxygen, which humans breathe, and absorb carbon dioxide, which humans exhale.

Mosaurus was the best reptile of its time, so it feared nothing but other mosaurs.
The long jaws had over 70 super sharp teeth, plus extra teeth in the mouth, meaning that nothing that crossed his paths escaped.
It is not known for sure, but the mosasaurus may have had a bifurcated tongue, feeding on turtles, large fish, other mosasaurids, and may even have been a man-eater.
He also attacked anyone who went into the water, even a giant dinosaur like the T-Rex, as if he had no competition.
Although most of their food is familiar to us, the Romans had their share of strange or unusual delicacies, including wild boar, peacock, peacock, and a rodent called the sleeping mouse.
Another difference was that whereas poor people and women ate sitting, rich men liked feasts where they ate sitting.
The food of ancient Rome could not contain the foods that came to Europe from America or Asia in later centuries.
For example, they had no corn, no tomatoes, no potatoes, no cocoa, and no Roman ever tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built a shrine to each of their gods, which was considered to be the house of the god.

Civilizationis a single culture shared by a remarkably large group of people living and working together, or society.
Civilisation comes from the Latin word civilis, which means citizen, which is related to the Latin words civis, citizen, and civitas, which means city or city state, and it also defines to some extent the size of society.
urban countries are the precursors of states. Civilized culture means the transmission of knowledge over several generations, a lasting cultural footprint and a sufficient cultural background.
Smaller cultures often disappear without leaving relevant historical evidence and are not recognized as true civilizations.

For example, the most widely used photographic film format in the world is the 35 mm, which was the dominant film size at the end of the analogue era.
still being made today, but more importantly, its proportions are inherited to the dimensions of the image sensors of digital cameras.
35 mm is actually a bit confusing 36 mm wide and 24 mm long.
The aspect ratio of this format (dividing by twelve to obtain the simplest integer ratio) is therefore assumed to be 3 to 2.
Many common formats (e.g. APS group formats) are equal to or close to its aspect ratio.
The rule of thirds, which is often abused and ridiculed, is a simple guideline that creates dynamics while maintaining a measure of regularity in the imaging.
According to this, the most efficient position for the main subject is at the point where the lines intersect, dividing the image vertically and horizontally into thirds (see example).
Throughout this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become rich and powerful, came under scrutiny.
For over a thousand years, Christianity had united the nations of Europe, despite differences in their languages and customs.
Its all-encompassing power affected everyone, from the king to the common man.
"I'm a Christian", he said, "and I'm a Christian". One of the basic beliefs of Christians is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and the church's funds are intended for that very purpose.
The center of ecclesiastical power had been Rome for over a thousand years, and this concentration of power and money raised questions about whether this principle was being adhered to.

The period in which these events took place is called the High Middle Ages, and it was the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries of European history (AD 10001300).

Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a variety of ideas in practice, ranging from technological drive or technological imperative to the firm conviction that human destiny is governed by logic and its manifestation in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general ideas: that technology itself follows a path that is largely culturally or politically influenced, and that technology itself exhibits an impact on society that is more intrinsic than socially induced.
For example, it can be said that the existence of motor vehicles is certainly a factor in the development of roads.
The national road network is not economically viable for only a few cars, so efforts are being made to develop new production methods to reduce the cost of owning a car.
Car ownership also leads to increased road accidents, which in turn leads to the invention of new techniques for repairing damaged bodies in health care.

In the context of Romanticism, the forms of geography and the time evolved, and the customs and culture associated with geography, and these, in harmony with the location of society, were better than arbitrarily established laws.

subsistence farming is farming that produces food in a quantity sufficient to meet the needs of the farmer and his family alone.
Natural farming is a simple, often wild, system wherein crop growth is achieved by using seeds from that ecological area, rotation of crops or other relatively simple methods such as .
Historically, most farmers were involved in subsistence farming and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures connect individuals with similar ideas who feel that social standards do not apply to them and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures may be distinguishable by age, ethnicity, class, location and/or gender of members.
The characteristics that make it possible to distinguish a subculture may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical or a combination of these factors.
Members of a subculture often indicate their membership through the use of a distinctive and symbolic style, including fashion, manners, and slang.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to draw attention to the few unfortunate cases where adults did not socialize children during their upbringing because of neglect, failure or intentional abuse.

Wild children may have experienced severe abuse or trauma before being abandoned or run away.
Others were said to have been raised by animals, and some were said to have lived in the wild on their own.
When a child is raised entirely by an animal, a wild child (within physical limits) behaves almost entirely like the animal that raised him, such as fearing or being indifferent to humans.
e project-based learning should make learning easier and more interesting, the approach to educational frameworks is a step further.
The 'scaffolding' method is not a learning method, but rather a way to support people who are acquiring new learning experiences, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
The support can be both virtual and real, or in other words, the support can be both the teacher and the little Microsoft Office letterpress guy.
The software will integrate virtual steps designed to question, reference and explain procedures that may be too complex for the learner to cope with on his/her own.

The use of video recordings has led to important discoveries in interpreting facial movements, or micro-worlds, that last for only a few milliseconds.
In particular, it is claimed that by correctly interpreting micro-expressions, it is possible to identify whether a person is lying.
Oliver Sacks, in his article The President's Speech, pointed out that people who cannot understand speech because of brain damage can still accurately recognize sincerity.
He even suggested that animals, such as domestic dogs, have the same ability to interpret human behavior.
20th century studies have shown that there are two sets of genetic variation: hidden and expressed.
mutation adds a new genetic variation and selection removes it from the set of variations it has expressed.
In the case of separation and recombination, the diversity between the two funds fluctuates back and forth in each generation.
In the savannah, a primate with a digestive system similar to that of a human has difficulty satisfying its amino acid requirements with the help of available plants.
n't that's the only way to get rid of it?
The easiest plant sources would be the proteins in leafy greens and vegetables, but for primates like us, they're easy to digest only in the form of cooked foods.
The Commission has also proposed a new approach to the use of animal feedingstuffs in the food supply.

Sleep disturbance is the process of intentionally waking up during the normal sleep period and falling back to sleep after a short time (1060 minutes).
It's easy when you use a comparatively quiet wake-up call that brings you to consciousness but doesn't wake you up completely.
lf you find yourself turning off your alarm clock while you're sleeping, you can put it on the other side of the room, so you're forced to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other biorhythm-based choices involve drinking plenty of fluids (especially water or the famous diuretic tea) before bedtime to force yourself to wake up for urination.
The amount of inner peace a person has is inversely related to the amount of tension in the body and soul.
The less stress, the more positive the life force is present. Each person is able to find absolute peace and contentment.
anyone can achieve enlightenment. The only obstacle to achieving enlightenment is tension and negativity.
Tibet buddhism is based on the teachings of buddha but was expanded upon as the path of love and various indian yoga techniques.

Germany was a common enemy in WWII, which led to cooperation between the USSR and the USA. At the end of the war, the countries clashed over system, process and culture clashes.
Two years after the war ended, the former allies were already enemies and the cold war began.
It was going to last for the next 40 years, and the armies that were authorized were going to be fighting on the battlefields from Africa to Asia, to Afghanistan, to Cuba, and many other places.
September 17, 1939 Polish defenses were broken and the only hope was to retreat and regroup along the Romanian bridgeheads.
THE PREVENTION OF THE RIAG PATRIC, the Soviet-Polish nonaggression pact, and other international treaties, both bilateral and multilateral.
The use of ships for the transport of goods is arguably the most efficient way to transport large quantities of people and goods across the oceans.
Traditionally, the role of the navy has been to ensure that the state can move people and goods, while at the same time preventing the enemy from moving their people and goods.
One of the most notable examples of this was the North Atlantic campaign during World War II, where the Americans tried to get men and supplies across the Atlantic Ocean to help the British.
Throughout the war, the German Navy, which mainly used submarines, tried to stop the traffic.

Ancient cultures and tribes began keeping them to gain easy access to milk, hair, meat and skin.
The domesticated goat was generally kept as herdsmen, who roamed the pastures or other pastures, and were often herded by herds of children or teenagers, similar to the more familiar sheep herds.
The Vane Road was built in England as early as the 16th century.
Though the wagonways consisted only of parallel wooden planks, they enabled the horses to pull them to achieve greater speeds and pull larger quantities than on the slightly more curvy roads of the time.
Lipes were used early on to keep the railway in place, but gradually it was realized that railways were more efficient if they had iron bars on them.
This became the standard method, but the iron used up the wooden wheels of the carriage more.
Then, in 1767, the first railways were built entirely of iron.
Homo erectus (or erect man) began walking upright two million years ago.
The Australopithecus was not accustomed to walking upright.

Pratically all computers in use today are based on manipulating information, encoded in a two-digit format.
A binary number can have only one of two values, i.e. 0 or 1, and these numbers are called binary numbers or  when used as bits in the computing range.
Internal toxicity may not be immediately apparent. Symptoms such as vomiting are fairly common and cannot be diagnosed immediately.
The clearest sign of ingested or ingested poison might be the open medicine pack or toxic household chemicals nearby.
Please see the label for the instructions for the first aid of a specific poison.
Entomologists use the term "luticans" for this group of insects.
The term comes from the familiarity of the larvae, which are extremely well adapted to living as parasites on humans.
Both predatory and bedbugs are native, adapted to life in the nest or in the host's home.
In the United States, there are approximately 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), making it the leading neurological disease among young and middle-aged adults.
Multiple sclerosis is a disease affecting the central nervous system, which consists of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerves.
The study found that women are twice as likely to develop MS as men.
A couple may decide that raising a child is not in their best interests or in the best interests of the child.
These couples may choose to give their child up for adoption.
In the process of adoption, the biological parents give up their parental rights so that the other couple can become the parents of the child.
The basic purpose of science is to use the scientific method to figure out how the world works.
An experiment is a test used to rule out one or more possible hypotheses, but also questions and observations.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts, especially the Latin Bible.
Aristotle's scientific views, including his psychological views, were accepted.
As Greek language declined, the Western world found itself cut off from the Greek philosophical and scientific roots.

The Hershey and Chase experiment was one of the main pieces of evidence that suggested DNA was genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages or viruses to implant their own DNA into bacteria.
They did two experiments, either with radioactive phosphorus or with radioactive sulfur in the DNA phage.
Mutations can have different effects depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the genetic material affected, and whether the affected cells are stem cells.
Only mutations in the stem cells can be passed on to the children, mutations elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature tourism attracts people who are interested in visiting natural places to enjoy the views and also wild plants and animals.
examples of local activities include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching and park visits, and learning about the ecosystem.
Visiting, photographing, and learning about the Boreno orangutans, for example.
Everyday morning, people leave small towns in cars to go to work, and they are passed by others whose jobs are where they just left.

In developed countries, you rarely hear similar levels of complaints about water quality or collapsing bridges.
Why do transport systems cause daily complaints about failures? Are transport engineers simply incompetent? Or is something more fundamental going on?
Traffic flow is a study that looks at the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions between them.
Traffic flow studies are unfortunately difficult because driver behaviour cannot be predicted with 100% certainty.
Fortunately, drivers tend to behave reasonably consistently, so traffic flows tend to be reasonably consistent and can be mathematically represented in a wide array.
To better describe the flow of traffic, links have been made between three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density and (3) speed.
The Commission considers that the aid is compatible with the internal market.
Insects were the first animals to use air for movement, and their ability to fly helped them to avoid enemies much more easily and to find food and companions much more efficiently.
Most insects are capable of folding their wings against their body.
This gives them more opportunities to find small places to hide from predators.

Aristoteles, a philosopher, thought that everything was made up of one or more of the four elements: earth, water, air, and fire.
solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although he also speculated that they form the new substances we see.
Alloys are basically a mixture of two or more metals.
Elements like calcium and potassium are considered to be metals.
You might also have alloys that contain small amounts of nonmetallic elements, like carbon.

A nuclear bomb works by taking energy to put together the nucleus of a cell with lots of protons and neutrons.
Like pushing a heavy curve up a mountain, re-splitting the core releases some of that energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means they tend to break down on a small blast or spontaneously.
The surface of the moon is made of rocks and dust. The outer layer of the moon is called the crust.
The crust is about 70 km thick on the front and 100 km thick on the back.
It's thinner under the tropics and thicker under the mountains.
on the near side, there might be more oceans because the crust is thinner. on the plateau, it was easier to get to the surface.
Theories of need seek to understand what drives people to act and what they like.
According to these theories, humans have certain needs and/or desires that are adopted as adults during maturation.
Theories are about what makes certain people want the things they do, and what environmental factors make those people do or not do certain things.
Maslow's hierarchy of needs and Herzberg's two-factor theory are the two most popular needs-based theories.
When managers start managing their former peers, this can generally trigger two kinds of behavior: one extreme of the spectrum is trying to stay "one with the boys (or girls) .
It's hard for this type of manager to make unpopular decisions, to call for order, to make assessments, to assign responsibilities and to give responsibility to employees.
on the other end of the spectrum is a person who is transformed into something unknown, feeling that he has to change everything the team has done so far, and make it his own.
Finally, the leader is ultimately responsible for the success or failure of the team.
This behavior often causes a rift between the managers and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams are as demanding as regular teams, but there are some slight differences.
The virtual team members are often the point of contact for their own real-world team.
They usually have more autonomy than normal team members, as their teams may meet in different time zones, which their local management may not understand.
The existence of a real invisible team (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p. 109) is also a unique component of a virtual team.
The so-called invisible team is a management team to which each member reports. The invisible team sets standards for each member.

As a result, the company's cooperation can lead to a new inventive process that meets the customer's needs in order to overcome the barrier.
Before an organisation can be innovative, management must create a culture of innovation and also shared knowledge and organisational learning.
Angel (2006) explains the continuum approach as a method used to help companies achieve higher levels of performance.
The neurobiological data provide physical evidence for a theoretical approach to cognition, and so it narrows the field of study and makes it more precise.
The link between brain pathology and behavior supports research.
It's long been known that different types of brain damage, trauma, injury, and tumor affect behavior and cause changes in some mental functions.
The rise of new technologies has allowed us to see and study structures and processes in the brain that have never been seen before.
This gave us a lot of information and material to create simulation models that would help us understand the processes that are going on in our brains.
Although AI is strongly associated with science, forms of AI are a very important branch of computer science, which deals with machine behavior, learning and intelligent adaptation.
Research on AI involves automating machines in such a way that they can perform tasks that require intelligent behaviour.
examples include checking, planning and scheduling, being able to respond to client diagnoses and questions, as well as handwriting, voice and facial recognition.
like this has become a separate discipline that focuses on finding solutions to real-life problems.
AI is now widely used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering, and the military, and it has also been incorporated into a number of home computer and video game software applications.

TECHNOLOGY offers a solution through virtual excursions where students can sit in classroom and view museum objects, visit an aquarium or admire fine art.
shared virtual excursions is also a great way to reflect on one trip and share the experience with future classes.
Students at North Carolina Bennett School, for example, design an annual website for their trip to the state capital.Every year, the website is redesigned, but the old versions are kept as a souvenir.
Blogs can also improve students' writing skills
Since students are often the most critical audience, the blogger tries to improve his writing skills to avoid criticism.
"Blogging also makes students better aware of the world around them"."Getting readers' attention encourages students to be cunning and interesting (Toto, 2004)."
Blogging is a tool that inspires collaboration and encourages students to expand learning beyond the traditional school day.

Kruger National Park (KRP) is located in the north-eastern part of South Africa, and runs along the border with Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and the Crocodile River to the south.
The park covers an area of 19,500 km2 and is divided into 14 different ecological zones, each of which supports different types of wildlife.
It is one of South Africa's main attractions and is considered the flagship of the South African National Parks (SANParks).
Like all South African wildlife parks, this park has daily conservation and entrance fees.
You may also want to buy a Wild Card, which allows you to enter certain South African parks or all of South Africa's national parks.
Hong Kong Island is the name of the territory of Hong Kong and is a major tourist attraction.
The row of buildings that make up the skyline of Hong Kong has been compared to the sparkling tulip charts that appear in the waters of Victoria Harbour.

The majority of urban development projects on Hong Kong Island are concentrated in the rural areas on the northern coast.
This is the site that was taken over by the British colonists, so this is a good place to start if you're looking for evidence of the colonial period of the territory.
Sundarbans is the world's largest coastal mangrove belt, extending for 80 km (50 mi) from the coastline into the interior of Bangladesh and India.
The Sundarbans is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The remaining part of the forest in the Indian territory is called the Sundarbans National Park.
The forests are not just mangrove forests they include some of the last remaining mighty jungles that once touched the lower Ganges.
Sundarbans has an area of 3,850 km2, of which about one third is covered by water or saline.
Since 1966, the Sundarbans has also been a wildlife sanctuary, and it is estimated that 400 Bengal tigers and some 30,000 star-billed deer now live in the area.

The bridge has a through-pass height of 15 metres. Construction work was completed in August 2011 but it was not opened to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is planned to be fully operational by September 2017, when the Brazilian customs posts are expected to be ready.

Chaco was home to other groups of indigenous peoples, such as the Guaycurú and Payaguá, who survived by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
In the 16th century, the Spanish conquerors and the indigenous people met and Paraguay, formerly known as the "Great Indian Province", was born.
The Spanish began a colonial period that lasted for three centuries.
Since its founding in 1537, Paraguay has been able to preserve much of its original national character.
It is well known that Argentina's water polo teams and players are among the best in the world.

The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Pound (FKP), which is set at one British Pound (GBP).
The only bank in the islands that can exchange money is the one in Stanley, opposite the FIC West store.
British pounds are generally accepted throughout the islands, and credit cards and U.S. dollars are often accepted at Stanley.
The outermost islands are unlikely to accept credit cards, although the UK and US currencies may be accepted; consult with the owners to determine the appropriate payment method.

Montevideo is south of the equator, so it's summer there when the northern hemisphere has winter, and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropics; temperatures above +30 °C are normal in the summer months.
Winters can be deceptively cold: temperatures seldom drop below zero, but wind and humidity together create colder feelings than the thermometer indicates.
There are no specific rainy or dry seasons: the amount of rainfall stays about the same throughout the year.
