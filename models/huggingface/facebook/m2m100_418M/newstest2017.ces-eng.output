A 20-year-old chef found dead in a shop in San Francisco
The twenty-eight-year-old chef, who recently moved to San Francisco, was the stairs of the local store this week.
But the brother of the victim says he doesn’t think who would want to hurt him, and adds, “He finally started to succeed.”
The body found in Westfield Mall on Wednesday morning was identified as a twenty-eight-year-old resident of San Francisco Frank Galicia, the office of a judicial doctor said.
San Francisco police department said it was a violent death and an investigation is ongoing.
The victim’s brother Louis Galicia told the ABC KGO station in San Francisco that Frank, who was previously a line-up cook in Boston, got his dream job as a chef at the Sons & Daughters restaurant six months ago.
A spokesman for Sons & Daughters said his death was “shocked and destroyed.”
“We have a small team working as a closely connected family, we will miss a lot,” the spokesman said.
In this difficult time, our thoughts and sorrow belong to Frank’s family and friends.
Louis Galicia said that Frank was first sleeping in the hostels, but that recently “he finally started to succeed.”
“He found an apartment, he walked with a girl,” Louis Galicia told KGO.
Louis Galicia said he didn’t think who would want to hurt his younger brother.
He had a gentle soul and a great heart.
“When he wanted to join the family, he always cooked our food, made our dinner,” Louis Galicia said.
He never wanted to participate in any disputes.
He was a brother who took things as they are.
“Even if everything else in the world was wrong, he was an unbroken diamond that he radiated every day,” he said.

The Czech Railways invested over 31 billion in the modernization of vehicles.
They have air conditioning and new toilets.
Over the past six years, the state transport company has invested over 31 billion SEK in the modernization of vehicles.
A third of the cars are currently equipped with air conditioning, and about half of the trains have a new system of closed toilets.
However, the amounts for modernization in each year with the exception of 2012 are gradually decreasing.
The Czech Railways in the last six years have invested over 31 billion SEK in the modernization of vehicles.
A third of the cars are currently equipped with air conditioning, and about half of the trains have a new system of closed toilets.
The money spent showed a two-year decrease in average age for locomotives and separate units and six-year decrease in classical wagons.
A greater share of the investments was placed by the carrier in regional transport, where approximately 60 per cent of the funds were directed, while 40 per cent of the company was invested in the renovation of vehicles for remote transport.
The average age of locomotives and units is now 19 years old.
Modernized older vehicles are considered to be completely new in this index.
If the modernization of the vehicles was not counted, the average age of motor vehicles of the Czech Republic would increase by ten years.
A little older are the average passenger wagons, the average age of which is 23 years when the modernization is included.
If only the age from the date of production was taken into account, the average age of these vehicles would be 33.4 years.
Classical sets composed of wagons and pulled by locomotives, however, in recent years from the Czech and global railways gradually disappear and are replaced by motor or electric units.
Between 2011 and 2015, the locomotive declined from 280 to 223 units, and the number of classic wagons declined from 2716 in 2011 to 2132 in the middle of this year.
The carrier was deprived of old vehicles equipped with leather seats and doors without the possibility of blocking the opening during driving.
From January to July, 110 of these vehicles were destroyed by the carriers.
From the investments that the Czech Republic plans to carry out in the near future, it is possible to mention, for example, the purchase of 50 wagons for a speed of up to 200 kilometers per hour, which the carrier plans to deploy on the international line Prague - Bratislava - Budapest, or a framework agreement for the purchase of electric units for the domestic speedways.
The contract includes up to 30 motor and 20 electric units.
The authorities have been aware of illegal advertising for a quarter of the year and are unable to get rid of it.
We are impotent, they admit.
For a quarter of the year, the online edition of the newspaper Aktuálně.cz follows the story of the billboard in the southern Czech Republic, which now attracts motorists to visit Lipna, where there is not only a tourist excursion in the crowns of trees, but also an Olympic park.
Highway managers know they’re standing out there, but they say they can’t do anything with it.
There are hundreds, thousands of similar advertisements across the country.
According to officials, the fault is a chatral law, which makes it impossible for illegal mobile billboards to be removed immediately.
First, a complex bureaucratic wheel is needed.
The company will change its name and the office will be short.
Or it’s enough to move the advertising a few meters and the official process must start again.
The Directorate of roads and highways a quarter of a year ago admitted: at the main drive from Českých Budějovic to Lipno, a advertising billboard stands on our land at the state road.
Three months were not enough for the officials to get rid of the unauthorized portable structures with a giant advertising poster.
As if no one was concerned, he was standing just next to the road, in a fifty-meter protective zone, where for safety nothing should be stated.
The road managers claim that they can’t simply deal with the billboard because of the drawing law.
You can load it and take it away.
“We can’t just afford it,” says Nina Ledvin, a spokesman for the Road and Highway Directorate, referring to a complex bureaucratic wheel that the removal of the billboard must be prevented by law.
The case of this particular billboard, whose fate began to follow in detail in the spring, is not unique and shows a general problem that the state and the authorities cannot solve effectively and quickly.
Only in the southern Czech Republic the editorial accounted for dozens of similar mobile ads placed against the rules right next to the road or near it.
Other countries are in the same way.
"We have difficulties with the company to force the trailers to remove," confirms the head of the transport department of the Czech Buddhist district office, Jiří Klása, whose colleagues address similar stories.
It is the fault of the law that binds officials.
First, they have to complexly address the owners of the billboard to put the advertising away.
But the bosses of the companies are often unacceptable or know the finta, which Actually.com described in the past, when the issue began to be more detailed: it is enough for the mobile stand with the advertising to move a few meters and officials can throw the previous call to remove the black advertising into the basket.
This is because the office has to determine exactly where the illegal billboard stands.
"If someone moves it and the coordinates suddenly disagree, they look at it as a new device and we have to address the owner again," Jiří Klása explains.
The new law will not help.
The change could be brought by a new law that will ban billboards on highways from September next year and restrict them on highways of Class I.
Critics point out that the rules for combating illegal and easily portable advertising will remain the same as before.
The authorities are not so happy.
Companies can thus continue to earn tens to hundreds of millions of crowns per year on the lease of illegal areas and no one can do so.
For example, the billboard attracting Lipno belongs to Commerz Billboard.
Officials know it well: the Czech Buddhist magistrate currently leads three administrative proceedings with it for the clearly built billboards.
The company is threatened with a fine of 30,000 in each case.
These are multiple ads that have been placed without permission in the road protection zone of Class I.
The proceedings are not yet terminated, says Jaroslav Mráz, head of the transport department of the Czechoslovak Magistrate.
Advertising, which Actually.cz is interested in, though among these cases still does not figure, but will soon be added to them with the most probability.
According to RSD spokeswoman Nina Ledvinova, the company did not respond to repeated written calls for removal, and the case will thus get to the table of the district and then probably the magistrate officials.
Commerz Billboard is one of the suspicious companies that fails to contact.
It does not receive the mail and the official headquarters in Žižkov has been cancelled more than six years ago.
It is not clear who is behind it.
In the past, the company’s mail went to the South Czech entrepreneur Anton Fischer, who was famous for a sharp dispute with the head of the Czech representation of the Hyundai brand.
However, Fischer, whose company Euro Billboard leases the plants from Comerz Billboard and offers them to advertisers, has previously refused any connection.
In the spring of this year, when the RSD began to be interested in advertising on Lipno, Fischer allowed government officials to send a letter to the secret company Commerz Billboard to his pension, where the company is allegedly newly located.
No one has yet contacted the road managers.
A foolish battle.
Similar silence or untransparent settlements changes are not unusual.
A few years ago, a company was sentenced to a fine of 2 million SEK.
But he changed the name and ICO and there was nothing to deal with.
The executive case returned, the ads stood on, elsewhere.
We are quite impotent against similar companies and their business practices.
It’s like fighting the windmills, acknowledges under the condition of keeping anonymous one of the officials.
No one has yet resolved the law in this regard.
He has spoken with a number of members who have addressed the problem.
However, they have not yet developed any activity.
On the contrary, the members of the parliament appeared, who wanted to extend the term for the preservation of billboards at the main Czech communications.
The government rejected it.
Billboards are not only a very sensitive and somewhat schizophrene topic for national, but also regional and municipal policies.
On the one hand they know about the social demand for their restrictions, on the other hand they need them themselves because of advertising in electoral campaigns.
I don’t support the relatively established impression that if something doesn’t work, it’s necessary to change the laws.
Farmers will harvest less grain this year, but more reefs and macks, the statistics estimate.
According to the Czech Statistical Office, the harvest will be 6.7 percent lower this year than last year.
However, this year’s harvest exceeds the average in the last five and ten years.
The greater will be the harvest of reef (3.9 percent) and mac (2.5 percent).
The harvest will be 6.7 percent lower this year than last year.
Farmers harvest 7.2 million tons of grain.
This is the result of an estimate published by the Czech Statistical Office on July 15.
The initial estimate last month was more pessimistic and predicted a decade decrease compared to last year.
Last year’s harvest was above average.
This year's harvest exceeds the average in the last five and ten years.
This year, there will be a greater reef and mock harvest.
Reef growers harvest 3.9 percent more than a year ago when they got under the roof 1.256 million tons.
This year’s harvest could be 2.5 percent higher than last year’s.
The expected decrease in grain production is due both to a 3.7 percent decrease in hectare yield to 5.71 tons per hectare, and a decrease in seed area.
Farmers have been reduced by 3 percent this year.
The wheat, which is the most important grain for the Czech Republic, is estimated to be 3.3 percent less this year.
The farmers put it on several fields.
However, a lower hectare revenue will be signed to fall to 6,04 tons.
A approximately fifth decline is estimated by statistics for the spring yellow, which is most commonly used for the production of beer.
The decrease in the harvest costs a 15.2 percent decrease in the seed area, but also a lower hectare yield.
On the other hand, it will be 6.3 per cent more.
The harvest will also grow.
The harvest is estimated at 1,305 million tons, which is more than last year.
The seed area has expanded by 7.3 percent.
The revenue will be 3.2 percent lower than last year.
This year’s reef harvest exceeds the ten-year average of 13.3 percent, while the seed is a third larger on the surface than ten years ago.
In the last four years, the fields with mac has also increased.
This year, it was planted by farmers on 35,543 hectares.
Compared to 2008, when the mac in the Czech Republic was grown on a record 70,000 hectares, the fields are half.
Thanks to the extension of the seed areas, this year’s harvest will be richer.
It will rise by 2.5 percent compared to last year to 27 423 tons.
The revenue of the hectare will be 6.1 percent lower.
Olomouc police accused two men of the attack with a knife and a machet, the court sent them to prison.
Police have accused two attackers of attacking a 35-year-old man with a knife on Tuesday in the centre of Olomouca.
"Al the attacked man tried to escape, he was caused by seed and cut injuries, which demanded treatment at the hospital and further treatment," police spokeswoman Marie Štrbáková said.
Both criminals were arrested immediately after the attack.
The prosecutor submitted a request to the court to take them into detention and the court approved him on Friday.
Both men are threatened to three to ten years in prison.
Police have accused two detainees of attacking a 35-year-old man in the centre of Olomouca with a knife and a machet.
The attackers caused him seating and cut wounds, the man ended in the hospital.
The attack was preceded by an incident between two groups of people, which took place on Tuesday afternoon at the Freedom class, the police said.
The criminals were arrested, Olomouc police spokeswoman Marie Štrbáková said.
A mass struggle between two families took place in the garden area in front of the Tratorie bar in the immediate vicinity of Olomouca.
After an aggressive word dispute, two attackers attacked a 35-year-old man with a knife and a mask.
Although the attacked man tried to escape, he was caused by seed and cut wounds, which required treatment at the hospital and further treatment, a police spokesman said.
The struggle, which raised a lot of attention in the city centre and which led to the interference of several police and police officers on the site, led to family disputes.
Criminals accused a 34-year-old man from Slovakia and a 37-year-old man from Olomouca of attempting to seriously hurt his health.
The prosecutor submitted a request to the court to take them into detention and the court met him on Friday, the spokesman added.
The machet was used in the center of Olomouca during a mass battle by the attackers also five years ago, it happened then just a few dozen meters further, before the Varna discothèque in Riegrov Street.
Police said that a group of about ten foreigners with weapons attacked the business guests who stood in front of the entrance.
The police said they had a knife, a hole and a machet in their hands.
The court then sentenced two strangers to a conditional punishment.
Lost and empty houses in the centre of Prague.
You’ll be surprised, maybe you’re walking around them every day.
One of the most screaming examples of an unused and empty house is the extensive building of the former IPB headquarters in the middle of the Senovážny Square.
It has long been a hotel.
Always nothing.
That it is necessary to build new and new apartments and offices in the metropolis?
And what to use the existing, often architectural valuable and protected?
Directly in the center of Prague in the immediate vicinity of the Václav Square there are several houses which, despite their location, size and often monumental protection, are just empty and empty.
Property in the center we have selected using the project Prázdnédomy.cz, which maps long-term empty real estate on the territory of the Czech Republic.
Houses are usually the victims of financial problems of their owners, incomprehensible relationships between companies or belong to a state that cannot or does not want to get rid of them.
There are more empty homes in the Czech Republic than homeless people.
The owners should pay a special tax for them.

Clinton’s spouses earned $10.6 million last year.
Trump refuses to publish his tax declaration.
Hillary Clinton and her husband, former President Bill Clinton, earned $10.6 million last year.
More than a million dollars were paid to Clinton for charity.
The majority of Clinton’s revenue – over $6 million – is behind their speeches.
Trump refuses to publish his tax declaration.
American Democrat candidate for presidential office Hillary Clinton on Friday published her tax reports, thus raising pressure on her Republican opponent Donald Trump to do the same.
Hillary Clinton and her husband, former President Bill Clinton, earned $10.6 million last year.
The majority of Clinton’s revenue – over $6 million – is behind their speeches, mostly from the period before April 2015, when Clinton started her campaign before the election.
The tax report showed that the spouses paid a federal income tax of 34.2 percent to Clinton last year, and a state and local income tax of nine percent.
In total, they paid 43.2 percent of their income on taxes.
But Trump has a problem with the same step, so far he has not decided to publish the tax declaration.
There is a certain possibility that Donald Trump does not pay any taxes at all, Clinton wrote on Twitter a few minutes after the publication of her confession.
Clinton is repeatedly returning to secrets about Trump’s revenue, among other things to raise doubts about whether her opponent is really as rich as she claims, AP said.
Trump’s assets are estimated at billions of dollars.
A lower earnings would damage the reputation of a Republican candidate as a successful entrepreneur.
Senator Tim Kaine, who in tandem with former First Lady, is candidate for the post of Vice President, today published a report on his tax deductions over the past ten years.
Together with his wife, Anne Holton, they gave 7.5 percent of their revenue to charity and 25.6 percent of their revenue to tax last year.
In Nigeria, a revolt has again exploded.
Islamists from Boko Haram defended consistent vaccination and killed doctors.
In Nigeria, cases of child abuse have repeatedly occurred.
In the northeastern part of the country, the government has declared an emergency vaccine because there two children infected with this disease have died.
The vaccines were transported by helicopters.
In the affected area operated Islamist terrorists from Boko Haram, who defended vaccines and even killed doctors.
According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the virus was unnoticed.
In northeastern Nigeria, an emergency vaccination of children will begin because there two children infected with this disease have died.
In Africa, it was last diagnosed two years ago in Somalia.
The Niger government has announced that a million children will be vaccinated in the Borno state and another four million in the surrounding states.
Nigerian military helicopters on Friday, according to the agency, quickly transported vaccines against child armor to the affected northeastern part of the country, where Islamist terrorists from Boko Haram operate.
According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the virus has circulated in the area for many years.
In the past, Boko Haram’s extremists have banned vaccinations and even killed doctors.
Their attacks on Thursday also made it impossible for doctors to get to the areas where children with rubber were found.
Both of the victims came with refugees from a newly liberated part of Nigeria from Boko Haram.
Director of the WHO department responsible for the eradication of the brick, Michel Zaffran, told the BBC that vaccination in Nigeria will begin next week.
The Islamic group Boko Haram has been active in the state of Borno.
The area was made available to international organizations and the government until the beginning of this year, when Boko Haram managed to substantially weaken this part of the country.
Niger’s health minister Isaac Adewole admitted that the new cases of the bullying are a great disappointment for the country because Nigeria wanted to announce that the bullying was eradicated next year.
According to the WHO, it is possible that although the disease has not occurred for two years, it has still spread among children.
Children under the age of five are now vaccinated.
In 2012, the world’s half of the crashes occurred in Nigeria.
While in 1988 it was still in 125 countries, it is now only in three regions - in Afghanistan and Pakistan and in northern Nigeria.
The Pope met with former prostitutes in Rome.
He listened to the stories of the fallen women.
Pope Francis met twenty former prostitutes who, thanks to the police, escaped from the gang of passengers.
The Pope listened to their hard life stories and called them to look with confidence into the future.
Francis wanted this meeting to highlight human trafficking and to call for an intense fight against it.
Pope Francis met in Rome with twenty former prostitutes who were released from the power by the police.
The head of the Catholic Church listened to the motivated stories of the fallen women for more than an hour and then called upon them to look with confidence into the future, a spokesman for the Vatican said.
Among the former prostitutes that Francis visited were six women from Romania, four from Albania, seven from Nigeria and one from Tunisia, Italy and Ukraine.
The average age is around 30.
According to the Vatican, they were all exposed to brutal physical violence during forced prostitution.
By the visit, Francis wanted to draw attention to human trafficking and call for an intense fight against him, the Pope's spokesman said.
Francis often points to the fate of people on the edge of society.
On Thursday, for example, he lunched with Syrian refugees who arrived in the Vatican this year in April and June thanks to his personal invitation.
France is fighting jihadist factory.
Without the help of Muslims, this is not possible.
The Muslims themselves must help France in the fight against radical Islamism.
In addition, the government of Prime Minister Manuel Valls is planning to make substantial changes in the functioning of mosques and the education of the doctors.
Since December last year, we have closed 20 mosques and prayer rooms.
And others will follow, the Minister of the Interior said.
There are more than a hundred jihadists in the country.
“If Muslims don’t help the state in the fight against those who violate public freedom, it will be increasingly difficult for France to guarantee this religion of freedom,” Prime Minister Manuel Valls said.
In particular, it intends to ensure that in mosques and prayer rooms only the Imam who were educated in France preach.
He also wants to stop funding for mosques from abroad.
Currently, about 20 percent of the money comes from abroad for the construction of new mosques, mostly from Morocco, Algeria and the Gulf countries.
For this reason, there are preachers who can spread radicalism in France into the mosques.
“Our country must show that Islam is compatible with democracy,” he added.
The key to achieving these goals will be the French Islamic Foundation.
It should serve as a bridge between a secular state and a Muslim minority.
No money from abroad.
The French Foundation for Islam was founded by then Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin in 2005.
At the time, the foundation had to contribute to the transparency of the financial flows between the mosques and the countries that finance their construction.
But the institutions soon hit internal contradictions and rivalry.
“It’s a total failure,” Valls said recently.
On the French political scene, after the attack on the Charlie Hebdo magazine in January 2015, the debate about a new institution that will replace the unfunctional foundation was burned.
Everything has been accelerated by further terrorist attacks in France carried out by radicalized Islamists on behalf of the Islamic State.
French Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve has recently announced that the new foundation will be established in October this year.
He will have two main tasks - to ensure the financing of mosques from domestic resources and also to oversee the imams.
Until now, it is unclear where it will take money not only for the construction of new mosques, but also various educational centers.
Several proposals are being considered.
One of them is a special fee or tax on halal food.
Here, in practice, halal food sellers would pay for the provision of certification.
Part of this money would then go to the fund’s cash.
The contribution of ten to twenty euros (270 to 540 crowns) could then be paid by French travelers who go to Mecca.
Every year there are about 30,000 people travelling to Saudi Arabia.
And not only that.
According to the prime minister, in the future mosques should only be performed by preachers who have passed special educational programs at French universities.
This should ensure that preaching is consistent with democracy.
Radical mosques are closed.
At the same time, the French government is struggling against radicals.
And more will be followed, the Interior Minister recently announced.
There is no place in France for those who proclaim hate in mosques and do not respect certain principles of our country, such as equality between women and men.
There are approximately 2,500 mosques and prayer rooms in the country.
It is estimated that about 120 of them are under the influence of radical Islamism.
Since 2012, the authorities have expelled about 80 imams and several other dozen are considering this.
But not everyone thinks that the actions of the government can significantly interfere with radicalism.
Those who want to be radicalised will do the same.
This does not happen in mosques, young people are radicalizing on the internet, said Severine Labat, an expert at the National Center for Scientific Research.
Draker Kelemen lost in the first round of the sprint with the star Baugem.
For the eight-finals, the Czech road cyclist must fight in repairs.
Drake cyclist Pavel Kelemen at the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro after progressing from the sprint qualification among the top eighteen lost in the 1st round match with the French giant Grégory Baugém, the silver defender of the past games in London.
He has to go to the eight-finals in repairs.
At the start of the royal discipline on the track, 27 runners stood and the best Czech runners of the present signed the fourteenth best time.
He reached the two-story start in 9,969 seconds.
In the main draw stage he was expected in the quarterly quarterly quarterly quarterly quarterly quarterly quarterly quarterly quarterly quarterly quarterly quarterly quarterly quarterly quarterly quarterly quarterly quarterly quarterly quarter.
Kelemen, though, eventually touched an experienced Frenchman, but he looked forward to the progress.
Great performance was made by Golden Defender Jason Kenny.
The twenty-eight-year-old Britain took the third fastest two hundred in history and won the qualification in the Olympic record of 9,551.
He was also the last successor, which was the German Maximilian Levy.
The British quarter was also successful with Bradley Wiggins, who scored a new world record 3:50,570 in the 4km race and went to the final.
The current maximum (3:51,659), which the British belonged four years after the Olympics in London, improved by more than a second.
Young doctors press: They want fresh wind in the industry
Representatives of young doctors gathered to approve new steps in their dispute about a new contract.
The Council of Young Doctors (JDC) at the British Medical Association (BMA) must ask the entire council to support further field events from the beginning of September.
The JDC says the ministers failed to resolve the issues related to the treaty.
Young doctors and medical students in July voted for the rejection of the contract agreed with BMA.
It was rejected by 58% of the members who participated in the election.
In a letter to members posted on Thursday night on Twitter, JDC Chairman Ellen McCourt said that the government remained “continually silent” on the questions, which led to the rejection of the contract.
She said: “In this light, the Executive Authority of the JDC, by voting, decided to completely reject the proposed new treaty and to call for a new formal negotiation on all matters.”
In response to the government's silence today, the Executive Board of the JDC formally requested a special meeting of the BMA Council to approve the current programme of threatened industry events from the beginning of September.
The dispute led young doctors to announce six strikes this year, including the first general strikes in the history of the NHS.
The leader of young doctors at BMA, Dr. Johann Malawana, resigned after the decision to reject the agreed terms of the contract that BMA recommended.
He told BMA members at meetings before voting before 54,000 young doctors and medical students that the agreement was good and should be adopted.
After the vote, the Minister of Health said that the contract would mean a burden for doctors in England.
Russia and Turkey: ‘Uncompatible’ alliance?
It was a gesture that ended with a crisis.
The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give hands and announce a formal end to the eight-month war and economic sanctions.
But while Vladimir Putin welcomed the Turkish counterpart in the St. Petersburg Palace's overhead hall, I had the impression that Ankara wants to desire for this reconciliation more.
It was hand in hand, yes.
But Putin didn’t smile and hardly radiated warmth from him, even according to his measured standards.
Recep Tayyip Erdogan, on the contrary, has repeatedly talked about his “dear friend” to Mr. Putin – five times, according to one of the reports.
I did not count it.
He also promised that relations with Russia will not only return to its level before the crisis, but will be even better.
The next day, some of the local newspapers wrote that Erdogan behaved as if nothing wrong had never happened.
I think his enthusiasm revealed the exact opposite.
But the persistent cold that radiated from Putin showed that the Russian leader did not forget anything.
The real cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his first speech: the shooting of a Russian fighter by Turkey on the Syrian border.
The reaction of Moscow was angry.
Putin was giving wounds around him and accused Ankara of having hit Moscow with a knife in the back.
The threat was even greater that it came from the suspected friend.
Rebuilding true confidence will be difficult, even impossible.
The Russian opinion has also changed since December.
The state-controlled media, after a month, led a massive full-floor campaign against Ankara.
Suddenly it seemed as if the Turks could do everything.
More serious was the accusations from top officials that Erdogan’s own family had benefits from illegal oil trade in parts of Syria controlled by the so-called Islamic State.
He strongly denied this.
But in St. Petersburg the official message came that it is time to move forward.
After all, this meeting took place only because Putin received the excuse he asked from President Erdogan.
Russia could have declared a victory.
For Ankara, the benefits of declaring a ceasefire are clear.
First of all, Erdogan was almost deprived of power during the failed coup last month and therefore he needs all his friends.
Repeated terrorist attacks in Turkey also shocked him apparently.
There is also an economic motivation.
The Russian sanctions had a harsh impact – especially the cancellation of charter flights, which annually transport several million Russian tourists to the coast of Turkey.
This number decreased by 90%.
When it comes to Russia, tour operators and charter companies will definitely rest here when there will be a renewal of flights.
They earn on Mediterranean tourism at the end of the season.
Even this week the state television promised cheaper fruits and vegetables when imports of agricultural goods from Turkey will be allowed again.
“Tourists there, tomatoes back here,” the news in the Vedemosti newspaper.
But the visit had another political value for Moscow.
Ankara is angry on the West for what it considers a weak reaction to a coup attempt.
In addition, the long-lasting irresponsibility of the long-lasting talks on the entry into the EU and the entry of Putin - which desires to take advantage of the cooling and break the bond of Turkey with the West.
The Russian leader gained bonus points when Ankara asked him for the help of the elected authorities after a coup attempt.
You have to understand that for Moscow, which has a deeply rooted fear of changing the regime, it is given.
So the summit in this pompese, coastal palace made it possible for Russia and Turkey to show what one of the analysts described me as “uncompatible alliances”: how the forces of two countries, which feel rejected and exploited by the West, unite.
However, despite public reconciliation, there are substantial differences between these two countries.
The first is Syria, where Moscow recently took the role of a peace maker, but where Russia and Turkey stand on the opposite side.
It could be said that after almost three-hour initial talks, the two presidents said at a press conference that they did not even mention this issue.
The Turkish president deliberately avoided answers to the question about the differences between them, while Putin decided to highlight these differences.
There is no clear agreement on which the two countries could find a common speech on the issue of Syria.
But after months of open hostility – and given the risk of a complete disaster when a NATO member Turkey shot down a Russian fighter aircraft – it is better that both leaders together again at least talk.
Royal Bank of Scotland disappears for customers outside Scotland
According to the executive director of the bank, the RBS brand is suppressed into the role of the back office.
The Royal Bank of Scotland is losing for customers outside Scotland.
Ross McEwan told BBC Scotland that the RBS brand was linked to the global ambitions of the bank.
It was lost when it almost disappeared eight years ago and had to be recovered from debt.
At the time, strategic brands used “RBS” to protect other brands of consumer finance.
There were millions of pounds spent on sponsorship of international sports, from the Six Nations Rugby Championship to Winbledon champion Andy Marray.
But now it has been decided that it is better to give more outstanding rather to national brands.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will be used by Scottish customers, but will not launch new shops.
All references to RBS in England and Wales, with the exception of central and stock coding on the stock exchange, will be changed to NatWest.
For customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland, the Ulster Bank brand is already used.
There are other, smaller brands for private banking that get more to the forefront - Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond, and Holt's Military Bank.
During the journey to customers and staff in Inverness-shire, McEwan answered Ross McEwan’s questions.
BBC Scotland said: “RBS’s brand will cease to be our investor brand and the brand for which our employees work, because now we are becoming much more a brand bank.”
Since the bank itself has become a global brand, RBS has become a global brand.
Now I say that we no longer have global aspirations, we have efforts focused on the home scene.
Each of these brands will mean something completely different in their own communities and our employees will work under these brands.
RBS has already said it will not continue its sponsorship of the Six Nations Championship, preparing the profile of individual sports sponsorship brands.
“It’s a good time for us to move to a brand bank because the basic question (which we ask) is how to focus on becoming a better bank for customers?” said the CEO.
Three years ago it would be very cynical if we said we would become a great bank for customers and those brands were introduced.
But along with how we focused on the needs of customers, and not on our own, I think there is a lot of change.
We can remind these brands again, I think the right time has come.
Frankie Dettori in Newmarket on the Predilection horse led to the goal of 3,000 winners
Dettori sprinks champagne after his double victory in Newmarket brought him 3,000 victories
Frankie Dettori won the 3,000th victory in Newmarket on Friday.
This milestone was achieved by his second victory in the evening on his local track - on the Predilection horse trained by John Gosden.
The 45-year-old Italian is the sixth Joker who has achieved such a result in row positions.
His predecessors are Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Piggott, Pat Eddery and Willie Carson.
The three-time jack champion Dettori, who previously won on the horse Ghayyar, said, “It’s strange.”
I am very excited because there is my family too.
I am extremely happy that this happened in Newmarket because I was just here 30 years ago.
It’s not a huge event, it’s not a Royal Ascot – it’s a Friday night on earth with 20,000 people.
I relaxed and I am very grateful.
Dettori gathers congratulations when after victory he brings Predilection
Two jackpots of this milestone achieved in obstacle dossiers - jackpots champion Richard Johnson and 20 times retirement champion Sir Anthony McCoy, who during his record-breaking career led to the goal of more than 4,300 winners.
Lester Piggott, 9 times Derby winner, 4,493 winners in his career
Frankie is one of the best jackets of modern times and it is not surprising that he has reached a milestone that only a few ridders have reached before him.
He’s stylish and strong, but it’s just his tactical fixton that distinguishes him from the other runners in the wheel.
He is a fantastic ambassador, his enthusiasm and charisma have attracted fans to this sport for many years.
A few weeks ago, I told Frankie at Epsom that if he didn’t ride only in the weekend and the big reaches, he would have already 6,000 winners!
But the truth is that Frankie has been a winner in the UK for most of his 30-year career, and that’s really something.
It has a living nature, which is good for the British sport. But more importantly, it is an incredible joke.
Frankie Dettori celebrated his success with his famous summer jump
From the summer finishes to the summer jumping, Frankie Dettori was the messenger of the British straight reaches for two decades.
It was like a mountain ride.
A countless number of winners of the big races, including his famous “wonderful seven” in Ascot. He survived but also the plane crash and had a ban of departure due to drugs.
Three years ago, he stagnated for the first time when he returned after a six-month launch ban, but demonstrated incredible internal strength and, despite all the doubts, he returned in the best form.
And maybe it’s not the last time – Dettori has previously stated that he would like to continue the race at least until 50 years.
Russian President Putin Releases Head of Presidential Office Sergey Ivanov
Russian President Vladimir Putin on Friday unexpectedly released Sergey Ivanov from the post of head of the presidential office.
Ivanov has been one of Putin’s closest collaborators for many years.
The 36-year-old Ivanov was appointed Special Representative for Ecology and Transport.
In a statement from the Kremlin it is stated that Putin “liberated Ivanov from his service as head of the Russian presidential office,” but no reason was stated.
His place will take over Anton Vajno, who has been Ivanov's representative since 2012.
The 44-year-old was a former diplomat.
He was born in Estonia's capital Tallinn in 1972, promoted at the prestigious State Institute of International Relations in Moscow (MGIMO) and worked at the Embassy in Tokyo.
On the website (in Russian) it is that he later made the head of the presidential protocol and the presidential office.
At his appointment to Putin, he said, “Thank you for your trust.”
I believe that the most important task of the administration is to support your activities as the head of state in terms of the draft law and the control of the extent to which your guidelines are followed.
Putin said on Friday that Ivanov asked him to be released from office and recommended that he replace Vajno.
To convince the smile?
This is a mystery of Moscow.
Sergey Ivanov was for a long time one of Vladimir Putin’s closest collaborators and as Putin worked for the KGB.
As the head of the presidential office, he was one of the most powerful men in the country.
At a meeting with President Putin, which was broadcast by state television, the two men stated that he was leaving the post of head of the presidential office on his own request.
But the smiles in the cameras convinced only a few people – especially now, just before parliamentary elections.
Is this the result of a struggle for power?
No one knows this yet.
But the official claim that the man, once considered as a possible president, suddenly desires to lead the environmental policy of Russia, has encountered great uncertainty.
On the Kremlin’s pages are quoted comments addressed to Putin, in which Ivanov stated: “It is true that in 2012 I asked you in an interview to entrust me this very challenging post, even a problematic post, for four years.
As it seems, I have been the chairman of the presidential office for four years and eight months.
Ivanov took office in December 2011.
He previously served as Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defense.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and previously, like Putin, he worked for the State Security Committee (KGB).
In the late 1990s, when Putin commandered the Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation (FSB), which replaced the KGB, Ivanov was appointed his representative.
When Putin came to power, he appointed Ivanov as one of his five closest collaborators.
In his time, it was even speculated that Ivanov could become the successor of Putin in the head of the state after his second election period, because the third period would be unconstitutional for Putin.
But this post was taken by another close Putin's collaborator Dmitry Medvedev.
Putin became Prime Minister three and a half years later before he returned to the presidency.
Thomas Gibson, the star of the Criminal Thoughts series, was released after he hit the director
Gibson was involved in the physical exchange of views on the scene last month in Los Angeles.
The television stations ABC and CBS, which are producing the series, in a joint statement announced its release.
Gibson, who played the special agent of Aaron Hotchner, apologized on Thursday before the announcement of his expulsion.
There were creative differences on the scene and disagreements.
I’m sorry that this happened,” he said in a statement.
According to ABC and CBS’s statements, details about how the character of Gibson disappears from the series that follows the stories of a team of FBI agents are a little later.
The four-fifty-year-old actor, who was famous for his main roles in the sitcom Dharma and Greg, has been active in the series since the first series in 2005.
“I love the thoughts of criminals, and in the last twelve years I’ve put my heart and soul into them,” Gibson said in a statement on Friday.
I hope I’ll be there until the end, but it’s not possible now.
I would like to express my gratitude to the authors, producers, actors, our amazing team and above all to the great fans in which this show could ever hope.
Return to the 12th series is expected on September 28.
In Banff, mysteriously landed fish in the garden
A man from the town of Banff asked for help in identifying the fish that appeared in his garden.
Kevin Bain believes that 75 pieces of fish can be a sand hole left there by a water slurry.
Bain, who lives about 500 meters from the sea, on the Periscope channel posted a short film of his discovery in the assumption that someone could help him clarify how about 5 centimeters of fish came to his garden.
Queensferry Crossing: Bridge now connects with Fife
The $1.35 billion project is expected to be completed by May 2017
The engineers have linked the northern platform and the Queensferry Crossing and the viaducts – the bridge now connects with Fife.
It is thus the first of the four closures between the “plattforms” who are now almost completed around each of the three pylons of the bridge.
Part of the Fife Bridge is now 600 meters long and weighs 30,000 tons.
It contains 10,000 tons of iron and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 hang lines.
The $1.35 billion project is expected to be completed by May 2017.
Economic Secretary Keith Brown visited the building today and was among the first to come from the mainland to the bridge.
He said: “This is a historic moment and a symbolic moment of building the Queensferry Crossing.
In this project, we are all witnessing how construction engineers in the fact impressive scale used more than 30,000 tons of concrete and steel to build this part of the bridge.
Despite the massive dimensions and weight of the bridge, the completion of the closure between the viaducts and the platform of the bridge was a delicate operation, which required extraordinary accuracy.
More than 79 percent of the bridge’s total area is now in its place, and the concrete for the last part of the platform is now leaked in Rosyth, so the entire platform is ready to be lifted up to the bridge.
Michael Martin, head of the Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors project, said: “The first closure in the construction of each bridge is always an important milestone.
On this amazing project, this closure represents the peak of land construction.
After installing the last part of the road platform and connecting it to the expanding North Tower platform, we then had to close the last gap on the north side - towards the mainland.
We did this by stretching the northern approximation viaduct 700 millimeters southward.
This was a massive and at the same time very delicate operation.
Massive because the viaduct is 222 meters long, weighs about 6,000 tons and was required to stretch it with a rise of about 3%.
Delicate because the tolerance with which the team worked was very small – just a few millimeters in each direction.
Fortunately, everything went very well.
Rescue in Moelfre Bay: Three men are “happy to be alive”
Three men are “happy to be alive” after the water splashed them from their fishing vessel near Anglesey.
The rescue boat station Moelfre RNLI issued an alarm on Friday at 13:20 British summer time after the crew saw the incident in the Gulf of Moelfre.
The three men tried to swim safe while their boat continued uncontrolledly.
“We saw their boat circulating near them and the worst happened to us,” said Moelfre rescue boat officer Vince Jones.
“Fortunately, a strong wind will take him away from them before we get out,” he added.
Two men were rescued by a local fishing vessel, the third man in the age of 60 was found without a rescue vest exhausted while holding boys.
They were all transferred to the coastal rescue boat and taken back to the rescue boat station.
Jones said, “Three men thrown into the water are happy to be alive and completely without injury.
The boat's engine had a wire for emergency disconnection, but somehow it was disconnected from the person who was driving the boat when a turning occurred.
Someone above those men held the protective hand.
The judge refuses to resolve the case because of his wife.
Peter Tluchoř is one of the three members who, according to the accusation, had to receive from Prime Minister Nečas and his then head of the Cabinet Jany Nagy political traffic, i.e. a lucrative post for political withdrawal.
In 2012 the tax package was approved.
Shnajdr, Fuksa and Tluchoř allowed him with their resignations.
Then they appeared on influential positions in state firms.
They were also suspected of fraud and sentenced to a month in prison.
According to the court, however, unjustified, and so the compensation was expected in a total of almost 2 million kronor.
The Tluchor is now in the case as a witness, after the intervention of the Supreme Court.
His wife works in a court building on the Fruit Market and resolves civil disputes.
Nevertheless, Judge Helena Králová wants to be cautious (solves criminal matters - note. red.) and avoid possible objections.
The case is likely to be held by another court in Prague.
The king has already twice dismissed the guilt of Jan Nečas, before Nagy.
It was the alleged abuse of military intelligence to track the first wife of Prime Minister Nečas Radka.
In this case, the Tluchor did not figure.
According to the lawyer Jaroslav Ortman, this is an unnecessarily exaggerated response.
I think it cannot be interpreted in such a way that the court is excluded if witnesses have a wife or relatives at the court.
I am worried that nothing could be judged at all, he noted for the newspaper.
“I think it’s hard,” he added.
In the case of political traffic, Roman Boček, a former official, is also accused.
According to his lawyer Peter Toman, however, the possible objection would have a chance of success.
The District Court for Prague 1 discussed on June 13 the charges of former head of the Cabinet of Prime Minister Peter Nečas Jany Nagy (now Nečasové) and other accused in the case of abuse of Military Intelligence.
In the picture, she comes to court with her husband.
He had to deal with the words of Peroutko.
For example, the ex-member’s wife had to judge the statements of President Miloš Zeman about the democratic pre-war journalist Ferdinand Peroutko.
Zeman said he was sympathetic with Adolf Hitler.
One of the students is dead.
The girl was killed in a air strike by the Allied forces.
She went to Syria with her two equally old friends in February last year from Gatwick Airport in London.
The British Ministry of the Interior has not commented on the report of her death.
The young London girls who fled from their homes were secretly transported to Syria across the Turkish border, the police said.
Shamima Begum, Amira Abase, and Kadiza Sultana, according to the media, headed for their next former co-author at the London Bethnal Green Academy.
The incident last year caused a huge wave of attention and also tensions in the relations between Britain and Turkey.
The British security forces estimate that around 600 British Muslims have traveled to Syria, including about 50 young women and girls.
Many of them joined the Islamic State and other groups.
Those who return home are a terrorist threat to the United Kingdom.
Work of dreams for a hundred thousand wages.
It’s a good job that you don’t need a college.
That’s how it looks at the first glance of the work.
And often the other.
The advantage is not only for the Czech proportions an extremely high salary (in Prague you will earn up to 180,000 CZK by working in IT), but also extreme benefits.
This is due to the lack of IT specialists.
There are thousands of specialists missing.
It is estimated that there are almost 20,000 IT specialists missing in the Czech Republic.
According to Grafton’s staff statistics, the most sought are programmers, developers, network engineers and application specialists.
The candidates can choose between several job offers.
Therefore, candidates do not compete for a job position, but a job position for candidates, says Jitka Součková, marketing manager Grafton Recruitment.
College is not a necessity.
Higher education is not a necessity.
Higher education means a good basis and is a general indicator of the candidate’s intelligence and educational capacity, but it often has little to do with the knowledge of development.
Developers have to constantly learn new things, which a once graduated college will not replace, says Petr Kubačka, director of Monster Career CZ.
They earn the most in Prague.
The remuneration rate is all over the Republican average.
The most money will come in Prague and Brno, in the regions it is no longer such a hit parade.
“The salary conditions in Brno are comparable to those in Prague,” Cubačka says.
Technical directors will get the highest revenue.
In Prague and Brno they can come at 120,000 - 180,000 CZK.
In other regions, the salary is lower, but it does not fall below 80,000 CZK.
The demand is also IT project managers.
They can earn between 60,000 and 100,000.
It is also about graduates.
While in some professions, graduates often have to go straight to the work office, it does not apply to the Aytiak.
If the companies pull over and pay over a specialist from another company, they like to touch the graduate.
They can educate them according to their own.
Without language they can’t.
Knowledge of a foreign language is suitable in every profession, but at least a decent English is necessary for the Azians.
Knowledge of at least one foreign language is a necessity for some IT positions.
On the other hand, we encounter a number of cases where companies are looking especially for a professionally educated and experienced person and are satisfied only with an average knowledge of English.
However, if, for example, a support worker controls more foreign languages, he is interesting for his employer because he can serve more customers from different countries.
Googles, there is a paradise.
It’s a good idea for the employees of Google to be jealous.
Of course, flexible working hours are for them, the possibility of working from home or different shortened hours, not only for mothers.
“The company provides newborn fathers with four weeks of extra vacation after the birth of the baby,” says Martina Jonek, a spokeswoman for Google.
Heating includes health care for employees and family, food, transport, training, wellness or massage directly on the workplace.
Whoever wants to learn has a green and doesn’t matter what new one wants to learn.
But the benefits do not end.
Such a full free refrigerator is definitely not to be thrown away.
Healthy lunch (in some locations even breakfast and dinner) is available on the site every day.
In addition, there are so-called micro kitchen rooms in all offices where people can always find a healthy snack, the spokesman says.
And so that nothing doesn’t have to go out, so what doesn’t sleep, it puts into the boxes that employees can take at night home.
What is the reason for these unbelievable benefits?
Create a creative and motivating environment.
“For Google, it is not important that employees sit in the office eight hours a day, but the results of initiatives or projects, shifts or developments, ideas and innovative solutions,” the spokesman added.
The United Nations has criticized Bulgaria for the criminalization of refugees.
UN Human Rights Commissioner Zeid Ra'ad al-Hussein accused Bulgaria of systematically violating human rights by criminalizing refugees.
The official strategy of the Bulgarian government "is causing serious concerns about the fact that Bulgaria does not comply with international law," Zeid Ra'ad al-Hussein warned in a statement.
He noted that "it is concerned to be witnessing how important and influential public figures express public support for criminal armed fighters who drastically host refugees on the border between Bulgaria and Turkey."
“One of the most serious problems is that almost all people who move to the Bulgarian territory irregularly are automatically arrested,” Zeid said.
And what's worse - they are often prosecuted and imprisoned - for a year or longer - if they try to leave the country.
Their attempts to leave the country are criminalized despite the fact that according to international law everyone has the right to leave any country, including their own.
Bulgaria detained 14,000 migrants this year, compared to 21,000 last year in the same period.
Pokémon Go – a pursuit of health and happiness
It is fascinating to see how the world is changing.
Many people have regretted over the past decade that teenagers and children are no longer playing outdoors and prefer to spend their free time in front of the screens.
Pokémon Go lifts people out of the sofa and leads them to activity.
The time spent in front of the screens was originally smashed on television, later on video games, and most recently on smartphones.
It is great to observe that technology and activities outside do not exclude each other.
Of course, I’m talking about the fashion, which is Pokémon Go, a character-based application that first appeared in video games in the late 1990s (later created a cartoon series, play cards, and more).
As with many cultural phenomena, there was a decline in interest in the U.S., Australia and New Zealand before the launch of this new game in early July.
The introduction in other countries was then delayed due to the great interest that led to the overload of servers.
In a few days, Pokémon Go has gained more users than Tinder and almost as many users as Twitter has.
How does it work?
In short, players on the smartphone go out to look for Pokémon that they track using GPS, and when they find them, they can “phot” them (through a screenshot on the phone) or “capture”.
Mania has captured the generation that was playing the game at a younger age, raising her out of the seats and getting out to look for Pokémon.
In the U.S. thanks to this game there has been a significant increase in the number of steps that a “mediate” person will take every day.
Apple’s Cardiogram for Smart Clock app, which tracks 35,000 users, recently to the Washington Post that within two days from the launch of the game, the number of followed people who exercised every day for 30 minutes jumped from 45 to 53 percent.
The company has no information about who's playing Pokémon Go - it only sees gross data about the levels of exercise.
Many public campaigns seeking people to “find 30”, “steep out of the sofa” and “be active every day” fell on the unfertile ground because most public health messages are boring and intended for people who don’t look good.
However, the importance of exercise should not be underestimated.
Those who exercise regularly reduce the risk of developing cancer or depression.
Physical activity involves weight control, high blood pressure, diabetes, and a long list of benefits that we can’t list here.
But the beauty of the game Pokémon Go is that people go out and do something they enjoy.
You cover thus three pillars of health - movement, fresh air and sunrise.
Some people even get new friends when hunting for Pokémon.
As usual, there will be, of course, those boring patrons who are looking for any excuse to complain.
And yes, someone can enter the door.
How and how?
There was a breakthrough.
In their time, smartphones apps, such as Fitbit, were able to track our activity, but they did not give us a reason to do something like this game.
The news comes up and the interest in it begins to decline at a certain moment.
However, thanks to the success of the Pokémon, there will be more games that will combine applications and virtual reality with real-world activity and help a number of people in the pursuit of activity, health and better form.

Simone Biles Wins Gold in Women's Gymnastics
Forget the pressure.
Forget the excitement.
Simone Biles is immune to this.
Dynamic at jumping.
No effort on the clay.
All of them were simple.
Excellent in everything.
Finally the Olympic champion.
A nineteenth-year-old American gymnast went on a straight route for the title in multi-boat on Thursday and overcome the rest on a full line under the Olympic reflectors.
The total score of 62,198 clearly confirmed her advance over the silver medalist and team member of the “Final Five” Aly Raisman and the Russian bronze medalist Aliyou Mustafin.
Simone Biles (USA) on Thursday during the performance on the clade in the multiplayer final of individuals in sports gymnastics at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.
Biles became the fourth American woman in a row to win a multi-beat, and the fifth in total when she confirmed her reputation as the best gymnast of her generation and the best at all.
When her overall final rating was on the table and her long journey to this moment ended, tears appeared on her face.
This success ranges her into the same league of unique athletes of her time as Michael Phelps, who added a new dimension to their sport:
Biles has dominated her sport for the last three years, winning 15 medals at the world championships - including 10 gold. Her spectacular compositions are a mixture of ambition and accuracy, and 1984 Olympic champion Mary Lou Retton has called her "the best gymnast she've ever seen."
The last test awaited her in Brazil, not so between Biles and the rest of the racing, but between her and the burden of too big expectations.
Anything other than returning home to his family in Spring, Texas with a hand full of gold medals, would be perceived as a disappointment.
Simone Biles (USA), left, and Aly Raisman are hugged after winning the gold and silver medals in the final of the female multiplayer individual at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil on Thursday.
The first Biles won Tuesday, when she was as a scream in the celebration of the departing national team coordinator Martha Karolyi.
Biles insists that during her long journey to the top she never looked forward, but that’s not so true.
Part of her composition in simple - the one that contains a typical triple salto with a double turn - is placed in Latin music, which would just go home, in the streets outside the Rio Olympic Arena.
It is not a coincidence.
The girl was adopted by her grandparents as a little girl and her talent was discovered by Aimee Boorman's mother on the way to the gym where Boorman was training and where she gained strength.
The multiplayer competition has not lost since the summer of 2013 – this is a series of victories that can continue as long as Biles will.
Although Mustafin took over on a short lead thanks to two spins, it was just an illusion.
Kladina and the simple - where Biles defends the world championship - are waiting.
She got back to the top with 15,433 points for the clay - and ended with 15,933 points in the simple.
Raisman hugged her gently while waiting for the final score — just formality — and around the brilliantly red, white and blue shadows the Biles appeared tears when the wish was fulfilled, which she once recorded in the journal as a little girl.
Raisman's performance was a little reward for the Olympics four years ago, when she divided a third spot with Mustafin, but then she got a bronze because of the sum of the three best sets.
This time, the twenty-two-year-old captain of the team, which Americans call “baby”, was quite ahead.
After her simple, she sent a crowd of air kisses, overwhelmed by a return, which sometimes seemed uncertain.
For Biles, the post that this nineteenth-year-old athlete posted on Twitter this week, where she became a complete hit, has a completely new meaning:
Police: Three people killed while listening to music in the car
According to a police report published on Thursday, two women and a 12-year-old girl were killed during the most serious attack of decades, in the case of the first serial killer in Phoenix.
Authorities that Angela Rochelle Liner, Stefanie R. Ellis and Ellis’ daughter Maleah were shot dead on June 12 in a car parked on the arrival road.
The report reports that the armed man stood on the side of the passenger and shot eight wounds from the hand weapon.
According to the police, the three-fold murder is not worth the robbery, because the attacker did not take the wallet, nor the amount of $2,900 that one of the adult victims had with him.
Police spokesman in Phoenix, Sergeant Jonathan Howard said the investigators are finding whether the shooting had no connection with any of the previous four attacks.
In two mainly Spanish districts, nine attacks occurred over the course of four months, killing seven people and wounding two others.
“It’s happening in the villa neighborhood in front of the houses,” Howard said earlier this month for the KPHO branch of CBS.
Police believe the suspect used several cars, including a brown Nissan from the late 90s, a black BMW from the late 90s and a white Cadillac or Lincoln.
Investigators refused to disclose what evidence led them to the conclusion that the attacks were related and were carried out by the same killer.
Ellis (33) was taken to the hospital, where she later died with her injuries.
Liner (31) and Ellis's daughter Maleah died on the site.
A witness told the police that it was not unusual that women were sitting in a parked car and listening to music.
The authorities also published a police report about the shooting, which targeted an empty cargo just half an hour before the three-fold murder.
Investigators found the bullets and from the remains of the bullets in the seat and from under the engine cap, they set a bullet.
The mother of a six-year-old child with microcephaly: “His condition improves”
Edmund Picciuto, like most children of his age, loves singing, toys and of course also his mother.
But unlike his companions, he suffers from microcephaly, which is a result of a genetic disorder that his mother, Elizabeth Picciut, did not know during pregnancy.
When he came home for the first time, I first thought I couldn’t do it.
I will not manage this.
I am not ready for this.
That’s not true at all – it’s clear that you’re ready for it,” she said.
She and her husband Vincent learned that Edmund may never know them and that he may not survive.
Some doctors even proposed that it be placed in the institution.
“My first reaction was that I thought people don’t do this today,” Picciut explains.
Edmund walks with the help of a pedestrian.
Until he was three years old, he couldn’t sit down, or swallow, and he still didn’t speak.
Some are already slowly filling up.
He walks with help and rides on a bicycle.
He also loves to play with his two brothers and loves singing.
Elizabeth shows a sign speech, using which Edmund says, “Please sing me.”
“We’re teaching him character speech,” Picciut told CBS News.
But it’s not a common character speech – he says that Edmund has invented some characters himself.
Microcephaly can arise from a number of different conditions: genetic, as it is in the case of Edmund, and after pregnancy infections caused by viruses, such as spalms or Zika.
The symptoms and prognosis may vary significantly.
It’s too early for us to tell what the impact the Zika virus will have on the lives of the infected.
Picciut remembers the emotional tax, which is chosen by an uncertain future.
I always ask, “What’s going on?”
What will be next?
I am still not sure of it.
In fact, I never asked what the overall forecast was, because I don’t expect anyone to tell me it at all.
Picciut has a encouraging message for the mothers of all children who suffer from congenital defects caused by the Zika virus.
The situation is improving.
Know that it will be better.
You will love your child and your child will love you.
Strong rain and floods demanded rescue work in Louisiana, Mississippi
Strong rain and massive floods in Louisiana have forced the governor to declare an emergency state on Friday.
The National Meteorological Service (NWS) that, after extreme floods, a number of rivers in south-eastern Louisiana and southern Mississippi are leaving their shores and threatening extensive floods.
Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards said government officials are constantly in contact with local authorities and the aid is already on the way to the affected areas.
Mike Steele, a spokesman for the Office of the National Security and Crisis Preparation Governor, said they were receiving applications for vehicles to drive in the water, boats and sand bags.
Steele said that only the district of Tangipahoa asked for ten thousand bags of sand.
Flood patrols will remain working in most southern Louisiana until Saturday.
The Meteorological Service said in a statement that more than 8 to 13 centimeters could rise above the sea.
In southern Alabama, flood patrols were in emergency on Friday, when rain continued in the area of the city of Mobile.
The Comite rivers at Baton Rouge and the Amite rivers at Denham Springs are expected to culminate this weekend.
Meteorologist Alek Krautmann said the two rivers could flood a number of houses in the suburbs of Baton Rouge.
He added that the danger is floods after the current in the Ascension district, when these divided flows will flow to the Lake Maurepas only slowly.
The Tickfaw River, slightly south of the Mississippi border in Liverpool, Louisiana, reached the highest level on Friday at 9 a.m. local time.
The rescue forces continue to take people out of the flood waters in the Amite and Wilkinson county in the southwest of Mississippi.
Leroy Hansford, his wife and grandson were among the rescued in Gloster on Friday.
Hansford (62) said that the water from Beaver Creek, which is normally more than 120 meters from his house, rose rapidly over the night.
He said he was alerted by his other grandson, who lives nearby.
“We woke up and the water approached,” Hansford said.
We had it up to the passport.
According to his wife, this is the highest level he has ever experienced on the river in the past 48 years.
Hansford said that he and all his family members are disabled and he is the only one who knows how to swim.
Hansford said the crisis workers saved all three massive military-style trucks and transported them to the Gloster fire station, where they remained hidden on Friday.
Krautmann said that with the continuation of heavy rains, the floods are “breaking rapidly” and the authorities are considering the evacuation.
According to Krautmann, a observer near Livington that 35 centimeters of rainfall fell from midnight to Friday morning.
Krautmann said the soil has been strongly saturated since Wednesday.
The authorities said the outdated rain and paid roads demanded the rescue of the residents from their homes in the Tangipahoa district and the cancellation of teaching in five school districts.
The WWL branch of the CBS station that 200 houses were flooded, according to the Tangipahoa senior.
The residents were evacuated to two churches, both of which are now flooded.
Mayor Robby Miller said the authorities rescued 72 people and seven pets caught by high water.
In the village of Amite and in the city of Hammond, refugees were established for those who were evacuated.
“They will be able to return home when the water begins to fall,” he said.
More than 20 streets were closed in the Tangipahoa district of Hammond due to the flood, and local residents got available sand bags that they could pick up and try to protect their homes and from water.
“The last big flood we had here in March,” said Lacy Landrum’s manager.
The floods are similar.
Rupert Lacy, Crisis Management Manager in Harrison County, Mississippi, said there is an enduring rain on the coast of the Gulf.
He said that a couple of houses were to be flooded on Thursday, but no one of them appeared in the report on Friday.
Keith Townson, head of Shopper Value Foods at Amite, has lived in the area for 40 years.
“I’ve seen water in a few places where I’ve never seen it before,” Townson said, “and it’s still there.”
Mahaj Brown (6) - "The Boy Shot As Solved" Survived Attack in Philadelphia
The police said a six-year-old boy was shot in Philadelphia and this week it is the second shot on a six-year-old boy in the city.
The child's grandparents identified him as Mahaje Brown for CBS Philadelphia.
Parents say that the boy suffered several shooting injuries, including weaknesses, legs, arms and abdomen, but when transported to the hospital he was aware.
“He captured this terrible power, his little body was shattered as it was solved,” his grandmother, Delores Melendez, told the station.
I can’t believe it.
The boy is in critical condition in the hospital and has undergone several operations.
The family told the station that the boy should be healed.
He had to enter the first class of primary school.
Mahaj Brown is among the four people who were shot down in Germantown.
Three other men were shot: two at the age of 29 and one at the age of 32.
One of the men aged 29 is in critical condition, according to CBS Philadelphia, two other victims are in stable condition.
According to the station, the child was found shot on the front seat of the vehicle along with a twenty-nine-year-old man in critical condition.
Two other victims were not in the car and the police are investigating whether any of the wounded men could be a shooter.
Investigators at CBS Philadelphia said there was likely a shooting between several armed men.
At the site were found the bullets of a type of attack weapon, belonging to various attack weapons.
It was a continued battle.
There were bullets on both sides of the road.
So it seems that there were several armed fighters who were actively involved,” Philadelphia police captain Anthony Ginaldi told the station.
Several houses and vehicles in the area were also affected.
No one has been arrested and the police are allegedly investigating the videos from the cameras.
Another six-year-old boy, this time a girl, was shot in the arm by a missing shot on Tuesday in front of a house in the neighborhood of West Oak Lane.
The girl is recovering and the police are still searching for the suspect.
Why We Need Simone, Gabby and Laurie
This is how I imagine the women’s gymnastics team for this year’s Olympic Games, and that’s for a few reasons.
First, I have been at every Summer Olympics since 1984 and the United States has never been so dominant.
And secondly, there are three gymnastics in this team, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren “Laurie” Hernandez, who inspired so many young colorful girls.
Everyone is proud of the composition of this team, which is complemented by Aly Raisman, who is of Jewish origin, and Catholic Madison Kocian.
We have a team that looks like America.
He also consolidated the presence of black and Latin American women on the top of this sport.
The number one gymnast in the last four years was an African-American.
Simone and Gabby were on the first and second editions last year.
This means something.
At the last Olympics, Gabby Dougals surprisingly became the champion of the Olympic Games and America was glad.
Now the world could witness the incredible performance of the three-fold world winners Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, who showed unexpected but mastery gymnastic figures.
On Thursday, Simone became the fourth American woman to win gold in a female multiplayer.
And the team member Aly Raisman won the silver.
We are witnessing the sport top, but in the gymnastics hours in the country it doesn’t look like that.
Simone, Gabby and Laurie took the same way to the Olympic team as Aly and Madison.
They are the “final five,” because the gymnastics team for the next Olympic Games will be composed of only four athletes, and this is the last year Marta Karolyi is training.
But the fact is that gymnastics is a financially challenging sport and gymnastics train mainly in private gymnastics clubs that keep parents who pay the costs of training, equipment, travel, dresses, competition fees, hotel accommodation (for coaches and their trusters and families).
Most of these sports clubs are in rich areas in the suburbs that can support activities.
In these clubs, gymnastics have all training and for the families of gymnastics and gymnastics, this is a costly and long-term commitment.
Aimee Boorman, Simone Biles' coach, and Maggie Haney, Laurie Hernandez' coach, both trained athletes at the time they started in gymnastics.
It is our duty to bring gymnastics training that is more accessible and accessible to the community of countless young girls that Simone, Gabby and Laurie inspired.
I founded the Gymnastics Foundation 20 years ago.
In my organizations where we offer free or low-cost gymnastics in Harlem for more than 15,000 young people within the city (especially black and Spanish) and we trained national and international champions.
In September we will expand to Detroit (my hometown), where we will provide high-quality gymnastics to young people who deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport.
Gymnastics develops strength, flexibility and coordination of the body and hard work, discipline and determination of the mind.
This combination means lifelong benefits for good health, success at school and at work.
It is the inspiration of this team to us will send thousands of young girls who will want to do gymnastics.
Participation in this sport is very important, especially for girls.
It is a very exciting time.
I thank you, Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison, for showing the “girl strength” and winning the Olympic team gold. And I thank you for motivating so many young girls of all origins to go on the way to become healthy, strong and successful young women.
After rejecting Jeremy Hunt's proposal, young doctors are ready to enter another strike
The ministers hoped that after the conclusion of the revised contract with the representatives of the British Medical Association (BMA) there would be an end to the disagreement regarding the changes. but 58 percent of the 37,000 young doctors who participated in the elections rejected the contract.
Hunt in July revealed plans to enforce the contract with the fact that NHS was in “no one’s land” and further delays would have a harmful impact on employees and patients.
The first young doctors have already signed a new contract that includes changes in night and weekend work practices in order to improve care in non-social hours.
Dr. Ellen McCourt, Chairman of the BMA Commission for Young Doctors, said in a statement last night: “Young doctors still have serious concerns regarding the proposed contract, especially in the sense that the current labour crisis will increase and thus all doctors will be treated fairly.”
Only eight weeks before the first group of doctors pass under the new contract, it is necessary to make progress and time occurs.
The efforts of the BMA to resolve disputes through negotiations met with a disappointment to engage the doctor and often with a silent silence by the government.
And that despite Jeremy Hunt's last month's promise that this option is still open.
“Jeremy Hunt now has to act, push for force and solve the concerns of young doctors.”
If this does not happen, then young doctors are ready to take further steps.
During the last strike at the end of April, 13,000 routine operations and 100,000 visits were postponed, as nurses and specialists were called to represent the doctors who were among the protesters.
The ministers hoped that after the conclusion of the revised contract with the representatives of the British Medical Association (BMA) there will be disagreements regarding the changes.
BMA wants higher payments for work on the weekend for 54,000 young doctors who would be the subject of the contract.
Daniel Mortimer, the chairman of the NHS employers, urged young doctors not to go into any strike.
Mortimer said: “The work will little or nothing at all, but there will be pressure on the already so overloaded teams and services and an increased fear, exhaustion and disturbance for patients, care staff and their families.”
Over the past two months, we have talked with the Council of young doctors and, together with the Ministry of Health and others, we have responded positively to their concerns about the role of the supervisory and informative.
Employers hoped that continuing positive involvement in other important issues - such as burdening, flexibility in training, further training for those who return after a career break, training costs, mutual recognition of subjects, study holidays and gender wage differences - was proof of how seriously employers, Health Education England and the Ministry of Health take agreements that were reached with BMA in November, February and May.
$60 a day can reduce the risk of heart attack
Thousands of patients at risk of a heart attack will be able to take the drug, which in turn costs about six hundred kronor (two pounds).
The anti-blood collapse drug Ticagrelor reduces in people with heart disease the risk that an attack occurs again.
The drug is now administered after a heart attack for 12 months to reduce the risk of stroke or other attack.
NHS NICE advises the drug to be administered to people for four years to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
Now, however, the NHS watchdog NICE recommends that it be administered to people for four years to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
In England, about 140,000 people suffer from a heart attack every year, and a quarter of them suffer from another attack or heart attack.
Heart attack and stroke are caused by the accumulation of fat, which on the walls of the arteries forms a coherent layer.
If this layer is divided, the formation of a blood clot may occur, blocking the access of blood to the heart and the development of a heart attack.
If the collapse is released, the bloodstream can continue, block the supply of blood to the brain and cause a stroke.
People who have already suffered a heart attack are at a higher risk of a further attack.
Ticagrelor, which is manufactured by the British company AstraZeneca and which is sold under the trade name Brilique, reduces the risk by making collapse less likely to occur.
In the proposal for the NICE directive, which was published today, it is recommended that patients receive 90 mg of ticagrelor for 12 months and then 60 mg together with aspirin, twice a day for another three years.
Professor Carole Longson, Director of the Center for Health Technology Assessment for NICE, said: “Despite the availability of effective secondary preventive treatment, there is a quarter of patients who have had a heart attack and who will be affected by another heart attack or stroke – often with devastating consequences.”
Fear of repetition can have a significant negative impact on the quality of life of the patient.
It has been shown that Ticagrelor in combination with aspirin is effective in reducing the risk of further heart attacks and stroke in people who have already been affected by a heart attack.
We are pleased that with the preliminary recommendation of Ticagrelor we can expand the treatment options that are available to many thousands of people who will be able to benefit from it.
Since information on the effectiveness and safety of Ticagrelor - especially about the risk of bleeding - over the three years are limited, treatment over this time is not recommended in the draft.
With the computer culture, fraud began to flourish in Muslim areas
Tower Hamlets Mayor Lutfur Rahman was resigned last year due to corruption, which was linked to government report
The culture of political correctness has led to the ignorance of the widespread fraud in Muslim communities, according to a government report today.
Former Minister Sir Eric Pickles has sharply criticized the police, electoral inspectors and municipalities for ignoring the abuse of voters because of “hypersensitivity to ethnicity and religion.”
A former community secretary, now the ruler of anti-corruption interventions, said that intimidating voters on the basis of their religion is so bad that the police should make cordons before the electoral rooms and protect the warned voters.
He recommended that voters take their identity documents and be able to prove who they are in the election.
At present, the voters need to indicate their name and address.
In the report, it is also proposed to apply an unclean ink on the fingers of people when giving a vote to prevent someone from voting twice.
Whistleblowers should have greater protection, says Pickles.
It calls for the press to have greater access to the documents from the meeting and to the decisions made by the informal committees or the workplaces of the group.
“It’s not only about protecting against electoral fraud, but also about protecting the local government from the wider corruption environment and financial fraud that goes hand in hand with it,” he said.
The news was claimed by Downing Street as a result of the electoral scandal at Tower Hamlets in west London.
Last year, the Special Electoral Court decided that the official mayor of Lutfur Rahman should be withdrawn from his post after accusations of corruption and illegal practices.
The court found that Rahman “cynically interfered” with the religious feelings of his Muslim community and silenced his criticism with accusations of racism and Islamophobia.
According to his words, Rahman “led his campaign so that it was a religious duty of the devote Muslims to vote for him.”
Up to 300 votes were questioned or as a result of the identity theft, when a person votes and gives out of someone else.
Sir Eric said there are evidence of fraud throughout the country.
He expressed particular concern over the fraud in the correspondence voting - which is claimed that the elderly members of the Muslim community during it developed pressure on people to vote for the candidate they chose.
Sir Eric, on the picture, gave several recommendations on how to clean the electoral system, including presenting a identity document
The report states: “The evidence has been presented that vulnerable members of certain ethnic minorities, especially women and young people, have been under pressure to vote according to the will of the elderly, especially in communities from Pakistan and Bangladesh.”
“There were concerns that... state institutions had turned their eyes to such behavior because of ‘politically correct’ over-sensitivity to ethnic origin and religion.”
Sir Eric presented 50 recommendations on how to clean up the system, including prohibiting political activists from manipulating correspondence voices and thus preventing “loading out of voices.”
The report, which is now evaluated by Theresa May, also calls for more detailed registration controls to prevent the use of electoral lists for immigration fraud and fraud on benefits.
Consider the possibility to ask voters to submit their identity documents before voting.
Use an immaculate ink on the fingers of people when voting to prevent someone from voting twice.
Implementing systematic nationality controls of persons to ensure that they can vote.
Applications for automatic correspondence voting are limited to a period of three years.
To prohibit political agitators and activists from manipulating the submitted correspondence voices and electoral coverages.
Give the police the authority to create courts around the electoral rooms.
Amend the laws to make it easier to prosecute persons developing illegal pressure under the Reform Act of 1983.
Prohibition of taking photos in the electoral rooms.
Require only English people to work in the electoral rooms (except Wales).
To strengthen training and ensure that workers comply with the rule that voters go to the electoral cabins individually.
Sir Eric criticizes the London police and says it’s “surprising” that no charges for crimes have been raised after the Tower Hamlets case.
“The Election Court has excluded Lutfur Rahman and his agent for corruption and illegal practices,” he said.
For a number of reasons he was found guilty beyond reasonable doubts - in the strength of proof of the crime.
He also criticizes the unresulted “control of checkboards” in the voter registration departments in the municipality.
Sir Eric said: “The last year’s ruling of the court in the Tower Hamlets case by awakening.
Our nation has a proud reference to parliamentary democracy, but the worrying and hidden spread of electoral fraud and the state of rejection by some authorities are threatening this reputation.
Crazy cycling twins of Duchess Kate and other twins of famous characters at the Rio Olympics
The fans of the 2016 Rio Olympics were crazy this week to the French cyclist Pauline Ferrand-Prevot, who is very similar to the Duchess of Cambridge.
But the twenty-four-year-old Olympion is far from the only athlete seeking gold this year, who can pride in her own double from a series of famous personalities - at least not according to social networks.
To celebrate the Olympic Games in Rio and all the famous characters that are currently appearing on our screens, the column for women FEMAIL compiled a list of Olympic players who are more than far similar to Hollywood celebrity.
Like a hunting animal: a member of the American shooter team Brady Ellison (left) was compared from a little to Leonard DiCapri
In addition to Kate's twins on the cycling track, a number of people online quickly pointed out that a certain shooter could be the twins of the star Leonard DiCapria.
The rider from the team of American shooters, Brady Ellison, caused a storm on Twitter after his pictures appeared, which seemed to be similar to a wolf from Wall Street.
Brady himself noticed the media madness and acknowledged he had heard of his similarities with Leem from childhood.
“He himself doesn’t see any big similarity, except the brushes,” Brady told Huffington Post.
“It’s a guy and it looks good, so I think it’s a compliment.”
One of the most popular London 2012 comparisons will undoubtedly be emphasized even more this year: the remarkable image between the British remote jumping Greg Rutherford and the favorite actor Neil Patrick Harris.
About the Russian gymnast Aliya Mustafin with her big, clear eyes, it was said to be a copy of the Cuban-American singer Glorie Estefan.
And when we look at the swimming pool, South African swimmer Cameron van der Burgh has been compared to the star of the series Gell Matthew Morrison for several years.
And for change: The user thinks Nathan has an “athletic version” of the actor from the movie The Beginning (Inception)
Another long-year comparison is the comparison of the tennis star Rafael Nadal and actor Josh Hartnet, who have similarly thick eyebrows and lips.
Russian silver swimmer Yulia Efimov is proud not only of the same skin and blond hair that has Annalynne McCord. And about Nathan Adrian from the U.S. team fans say she looks like "the athletic version of Joseph Gordon Levitt."
Famous women: football star Hope Sol (left) and serial actress Dexter Jennifer Carpenter (right) have a similar shape of face and eyes
Not just one: Twitter users were very pleased that the similarities were noticed by others
On the waves theory: According to this user there may be a reason for similar appearance of couples
One Twitter user recently expressed its satisfaction on the site that “the rest of the Internet thinks that Hope Sol and Jennifer Carpenter are really identical.”
Football star Hope Sol and actress Dexter Jennifer Carpenter have a truly incredibly similar shape of face and eyes.
Among other favourite comparisons is Kerri Walsh-Jennings and her smile, which is almost identical to the smile of actress Laura Linney, or gold medal holders for gymnastics Gabby Douglas, proud of her wonderfully wide smile, which seems to copy the smile of Gabrielle Union, the star of the movie Bravo, girls!
The Olympic Games commentator of the CBC apologizes for saying about a Chinese swimmer that she was “bound”
The audience of Wednesday's live broadcast from the Olympic Games at the CBC station angry an analysis of the performance of the fourteen-year-old Ai Yanhan by commentator Byron MacDonald.
The Canadian CBC was forced to apologize after one of its commentators said that a fourteen-year-old Chinese swimmer “trained like a smell” and “boiled out” during the race.
The commentator Byron MacDonald believed that his microphone was turned off when at the end of the final of the women's 4x200 meters free style he began to crack his own opinions.
MacDonald, who had to bring “resurrection” to the CBC commentary team, among other things stated: “This fourteen-year-old Chinese girl gave up, you crazy.”
Too much excitement, pulled like a smell, exploded.
thank you.
The Chinese swimmer Ai Yanhan (14) swim the second stafet of the race at 1:57.79 - 1.61 seconds slower than the Canadian Taylor Ruck, allowing the Canadians to reach China.
Guests in Canada began to quickly sound online and were scared by the tone and language that the commentator used.
Emmett Macfarlane wrote on Twitter: “The spokesman told CBC that a fourteen-year-old swimming woman from China was ‘washing out’????”
The idiot didn’t notice that he was still in the broadcast.”
Ai Yanhan from China in the final of the women's 4x200 meters free-style squad race was described as: "This little 14-year-old from China gave up, you crazy."
The criticism of Byron MacDonald on Twitter came from all sides and many asked for his appeal
When Twitter users learned how insensitive Byron MacDonald is, they didn’t stay back.
Another user, Sarah Paradis, wrote: 'Wow #ByronMacDonald.
You represent CBC and Canada and it sounds like we’d be a band of racists.
Shortly after that, Scott Russel, who hosted the CBC broadcast, apologized for MacDonald's live comment and said: "We apologize for the comment on the performance of the swimmer who escaped into the broadcast."
It was an unfortunate choice of words, we’re sorry that it happened.”
CBC finally apologized more than 90 times to people who tweeted in response to a comment
Scott Russel must apologize on behalf of McDonald's
The CBC then copied and placed their apology in a response to more than 90 Twitter users who complained about the comments of the commentator MacDonald.
The station also quickly apologized and published a statement.
He sincerely regrets that the words were said, he shouldn’t get into the ether.
We quickly apologized to our broadcast viewers and those who follow us on social networks.
To be clear, Byron's comments concerned the performance of the swimmer, not the swimmer itself.
In other words, it was an inappropriate and unhappy choice of words.Byron deeply apologizes for what he said.
On Thursday afternoon, Byron MacDonald apologized in a live broadcast and tried to explain his note by claiming that he did not want it to appear as a personal attack.
"I would like to apologize for the comment I made yesterday night after the women's staff," he said in a broadcast from the Olympics on CBC.
“I mean the performance of a swimmer and not the person of a swimmer as such.”
“There is no need to say that I did not intend any dishonesty and I am very sorry for it.”
Customers in Primark angry by a woman who was not ashamedly testing the underwear in the middle of the store
When the woman dressed out to try the pants at the Primark store, the buyers were not sure in which direction to look.
To make it even worse, she tried how her size fell, pulled her pants and returned them back to the rack.
She continued the search and finally tried four pairs of pants in the Bouverie Place shopping center in Flokestone.
Primark shop in the Bouverie Place shopping center in Folkestone, where a woman tried the pants before returning them to the rack
The mother of two children, Jenny Davidson, who was at the time in the store, said that the mysterious woman, after trying her underwear, “was dressed again and went out of the store without buying anything.”
She said, “People could not believe with their own eyes.”
She stood in the middle of the store, took the pants from the rack, wrapped her own pants and pants and put them on.
“She didn’t even try to find a discreet place – just so she stood there, drunk like a monkey.”
“Everyone just looked at her pants again, and obviously they didn’t like her because she returned them back to the rack.”
She did the same with the other three before she finally decided she didn’t like anything, she dressed again and went away.
“It seemed that she didn’t care who she was looking at – nor thought of the man who would buy the pants she tried.”
Mrs. Davidson, 33 years old, who lives in Kent, said, “The idea that someone takes the pants that someone else was wearing and no one has cleaned them is ugly.”
The incident occurred on Tuesday afternoon.
Mrs. Davidson added: “When she left, I picked up things that she obviously tried to pull them out of sale – which is the only right thing.”
“I’d be afraid of the idea that I’m bringing new pants home and I’ll find that another woman was wearing them, wearing them off, and that they’re not washed out.”
The store spokesman Primark said: “Primark knows about the incident that happened in our store in Folkestone on Tuesday, August 9.”
All products were withdrawn from the sale.
How to defend against the attack of weapons using Krav Maga
The world outside is dangerous, but thanks to this video from Dailymail.com it could be a bit safer for you.
We talked to Rhon Mizrachi, the great master of the Krav Magy Federation based in New York, to find out how to deal with armed thieves on a close distance.
This video will show you how to suddenly gain superiority over the violent, whether he approaches you from the front or from the back.
If he approaches you from the back, says Mizrachi, then the first thing you have to do is turn to see your attacker and “have a free track of the missile.”
You then take the weapon between your forearms and your arm just before you throw it into your face with a free neck.
Then the knee follows to the weaknesses, and while the attacker shines in pain, you scratch his weapon from his hand, you hit his main to his face and you begin to retreat, the weapon while you will keep targeted on him.
If an armed man approaches you from the front, it’s a similar technique – get your body out of the fire line, catch the weapon and scratch it so that the scammers can’t shoot.
At the same time, put the force into the weapon and hit the attacker into the chest, then scratch the weapon from its scratch and begin to retreat, still target it.
Does it sound complicated?
Look at the video where you will see exactly how Mizrachi does it.
But remember that the safest way to get out of the kidnapping – unless you’re a great master Krav Maga – is to issue all the cash.
Traveler Ian Wright lists the most dirty places in Europe in a travel guide
The British traveler decided to submit a heavy test to his immune system and a donating reflex - by olizing the most dirty and unpleasant places in Europe.
The moderator and author of the journals, Ian Wright (51), originating in Suffolk, on the proof of the strength of his immune system, broke the euro banknotes, the wallets on the Piccadilly Circus, the splash button on the toilet in the train, and the Russian public phone.
He used a luminometer to show to himself and to all of us what he is going to do.
The experiment based on which the Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength was filmed, however, brought interesting results.
The idea of swallowing the spray button in the train, which has been used by thousands of other people, may seem completely disappointing, however, for example, in the kitchen drain there is actually much more harmful bacteria.
During his entire trip to Europe, Ian Wright talked with doctors and health specialists about the strengthening of intestinal flora bacteria and his own health.
Fortunately, nothing in his mouth left worse than the taste.
Ian Wright was famous for testing his intestines' resistance on his journey around the world and eating strange and amazing things.
During this mission he completely safely tested his immune system – from the public walls on the railway stations to the splashboard.
In the film he filmed, he says: “Since childhood, I had no much care about my health and I had everything possible in my mouth, from garlic to eating worms and water.”
In the film, he confirmed his reputation.
The only thing he refused was the dirty public toilets in Russia.
After a simple scan, the luminometer showed the value of more than 4000 units.
For comparison, fresh washed hands should be less than 60.
One public toilet in Russia, however, refused to olize after its luminometer showed more than 4000 units, while fresh washed hands have less than 60 units.
Ian Wright and the Finnish dairy manufacturer Valio filmed the traveler's film called The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength, which shows the number of bacteria in different places, such as in the bathroom
In the film, he said, “This is almost the worst thing I’ve ever felt in the toilet.”
There is nothing more dirty than this!
I’m not going to do anything because it’s unpleasant.
The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength film was filmed in collaboration with the Finnish dairy producer Valio.
The company provided Mr. Wright with Valio Gefilus, which contains dairy acid bacteria and vitamins C and D, which in humans help to strengthen intestinal bacteria and the immune system.
Niko Vuorenmaa, Valio’s senior vice president for food, juices and new categories, said: “We wanted to offer consumers something really new.
Something that would follow with interest and at the same time would allow us to explain the benefits of probiotics.
We’ve invented a lot of crazy ideas that ended with the idea of “to call Ian.”
It is said that interest in intestinal health is becoming a global phenomenon.
Instead of just talking about products, we wanted to put them into wider contexts - good and bad bacteria in our daily environment, the importance of intestinal health and how it is linked to the immune system.
The growing interest in healthy intestines is a global phenomenon and through this document we have brought more detailed information to consumers in an interesting way.
I also think there is a great sense of humor in the movie!
Tom Hakala, who directed the film, adds: “Let’s say it this way, Ian would lose my respect if he wiped something of what I wanted for him – like the disgusting Russian toilet that appears in the film.”
Some things were naturally easier for Iana to olize, and others were quite difficult.
I’m glad we’ve made some of those dirty things.”
Valio conducted a 2015 survey that found that 84 percent of respondents associated milk acid bacteria primarily with stomach and intestinal health, and 58 percent said they at least occasionally consumed products containing added milk acid bacteria.
Family of Social Needs Destroyed a City Building in Saltash, Cornwall
The family of socially needed left 50,000 pounds of damage on their municipal house after they were accused of terrorizing their neighbors.
Tanya Skeldon and her partner Shaun Trebilcock were displaced from the house in Saltash, Cornwall, after a long series of complaints against them.
After their violent withdrawal from the house, residential co-operation officials were shocked when they found the property in an emergency state.
There were holes in the walls, the floor cover was scattered, all over the floor was wrapped waste, and the walls were counted.
The family has already moved and is believed to live in a private accommodation.
Donna McEvoy, director of housing in Cornwall Housing said she was worried whether the house would go to rescue.
She said, “It was a nightmare for people here and I don’t think people should live this way.
A number of circumstances must be considered, because this property will probably come into consciousness as “not so nice part” of Cornwall.
The family is unknown and their names are unknown.
The couple has three sons who were sometimes staying in the house, and the police said the horror that the family acted belonged to street battles using baseball pads, intimidating the surrounding inhabitants, drug use, drug distribution and loud screams, disputes and insults.
Skeldon (47), whose name was mentioned in the rental contract, was sentenced in June for anti-social behavior.
In several rooms in the house, which may be destroyed, was found stumbling waste.
In the house where drugs were distributed in the past, a floor cover was cut off.
Neighbors say they saw them on the street, and regularly there people called the police.
Cornwall Housing and her partner violently moved out of the house this week after they received an additional 11 week deadline to voluntarily move out.
The neighbors, who were relieved, welcomed the displacement with the fact that their lives were a living hell.
One of them said, “They didn’t care about anyone at all.”
We have lived with them for 20 years and it has always been so.
How many times we have seen the police here, cannot be counted at all.
“We couldn’t sleep this morning.”
We got up because there was an incredible silence here - we are not used to it!
It will be nice when they’re finally gone.
Adam Fitzpatrick, the supervisory manager in the Cornwall Housing neighborhood, said the family failed to cooperate with local authorities.
The family lived in the house for 20 years, the police were regularly called to the house.
The waste and old toys were crawled in the grown part of the municipal house.
He adds: “It’s a shame that the tenant failed to take responsibility for its own behavior and the behavior of its family. Migration is always the last step that Cornwall Housing is considering.
It was a very complicated case because their behavior was extreme and their actions, according to witnesses, had to scare her neighbors.
I appreciate all the work that my team, the police of Devon and Cornwall and the local community members have courageously informed us.
I hope that this step will bring some comfort to the neighbors and at the same time bring the message that we will not tolerate non-social behavior.
Fitzpatrick said that all three sons of the rental woman who lived in the house at different times were around 20 years old.
Polluted mattress that after moving remained on the floor of one of the bedrooms in the house
Workers will now have to remove the masses of waste that remained thrown around the house
In 2014, the police carried out a racing in the house and found over 70 grams of cannabis, weights, equipment and 1,700 pounds in cash.
Skeldon was sentenced to a fine when she was found guilty of possession of class B drugs she wanted to sell.
She claimed that the money was allocated to the foundation of the house for her son, Lee Skeldon, who died in a car accident in 2013.
It is believed that Tanya and her partner after moving now live in a private accommodation in Plymouth.
The walls in many rooms of the house were painted graffiti.
Police say they will seek to retire tenants who violate the rules of their rental contracts
Angela Crow from the Denov and Cornwall police said the displacement was sending a clear message to other renters who will continue to violate the rules.
“This is a message to all those who think they can behave without punishment, and to those who would like to follow such behavior,” she said.
The Denov and Cornwall police will never tolerate criminal and non-social behavior and will continue to cooperate with partners to protect our communities.
Tourists in Portugal scared after low aircraft flight over the beach
Tourists who were enjoying the sunrise in the Portuguese Aveiro were scared to die
The P-3C Orion flight was incredibly low.
The military said it was an exercise flight and insisted that there was no threat to security.
At the moment when a low-flying drill snapped over the filled beach, the scared tourists caught panic.
The dramatic footage shows a military aircraft getting to a distance almost at a touch of sunny people on a sandy beach near the city of Aveiro in northern Portugal.
The tourists began to rise after they were annoyed by the noise of the drone's engines, without seeing what came out of the clouds.
The incident occurred in Costa Nova near Aveiro.
Daniel Fernandes, one of the few recreators who posted videos of the dramatic flight on social networks, said: “The aircraft crossed twice really low and at one moment it seemed to collapse.”
Nuno Arroja adds: “I surfed and I really thought the plane would fall on my head.”
Tourists on the beach in Aveir were scared when a plane flying low in the dark appeared.
The Portuguese military air force said today that the pilot of the P-3C Orion was on an exercise flight to identify the fishing vessel near the coast and had to tolerate low because it was the only way to check the vessel.
The plane allegedly flew slightly lower than usual due to poor visibility caused by smoke from nearby forest fires.
This summer, forest fires destroyed part of the continental Portugal and killed four people on the island of Madeira.
The Portuguese military air force said today that the pilot had to fly low due to the thick cloud and smoke from the fires that prevented him from seeing.
The aircraft was on an exercise flight and the pilot was asked to identify the fishing vessels as part of the training.
Half of the funeral services do not comply with the rules.
Half of the service providers do not comply with the law.
The Czech Trade Inspectorate (ČOI) found this in the second quarter.
The funeral services often do not inform the survivors of their prices or do not issue a written confirmation of receipt of the order.
It has imposed a total of 73,000 crore fine.
This was by its spokesman Jiří Fröhlich.
The inspectors found errors at 47 of the 95 checks.
In addition to the lack of information about the prices and the lack of confirmation, some funeral services also sold products or provided services at prices other than agreed.
In five cases, the products sold were not properly labelled and once the seller used an officially unverified measuring machine.
The inspection therefore banned the sale of 23 products for a total of 7077 crowns.
This applied to urn packaging, candle covers and vasses that were not properly marked with mandatory information.
“Because there are still violations in this specific service area, the control actions will continue in the next quarter of this year,” Fröhlich added.
London schoolgirl who joined ISIS was killed in Syria
It was that Kadiza Sultan, one of the three British schoolchildren who left London last year to join ISIS, died in Syria.
Prosecutor Tasnime Akunjee said the family learned about her death in Syrian Raqqa a few weeks ago.
ITV News on Thursday that she was likely killed during a Russian air strike in Rakka, which is the basement of the group in the country.
The Sultan was 17 years old and, according to her family, she died just in the moment she was preparing to escape from the war-successed country and to return to Britain.
“A man wants to believe that the only good thing in all this thing – such as a message and warning to others that these are the real dangers associated with the way to the war zone – is that it will prevent people from ever making decisions,” Akunjee said.
Sultana and two other schoolchildren from the eastern part of London entered the plane to Turkey in February 2015 and then the bus to the border with Syria.
The Sultana family learned that she was married to a warrior of the Islamic State in Syria - and in a few months she was widowed.
Reid says that if Clinton is elected, she will leave Garland as a candidate for the Supreme Court.
Senate leader for the Democratic Party Harry Reid says he is convinced that Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton will nominate Judge Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court if she is elected.
Republicans in the Senate blocked Garland's nomination, even though President Barack Obama nominated him in March.
Senate majority leader Mitch McConnel says that the person who replaces the deceased judge of the Supreme Court will be elected by the future president.
Reid said during a conference speech on Thursday that he believes that Clinton will choose Garland “with a certain degree of reliability.”
Reid's spokesman later said he did not directly talk to Clinton about whether Garlanda would be nominated, and that he was just speculating.
He appreciated Garland and said Clinton's team would not want to "drop the ship" by choosing someone else.
Garland is the chairman of the Federal Court of Appeal in Washington.
Reid said the Republicans who block Garland’s nomination are “the servants” and “the “pushers” of the Republican candidate for Donald Trump’s presidential office.
He said Trump was not in office.
According to the magazine Treats, the naked calendar is "for both women and men"
The Treats magazine is working closely with photographer David Bellemer to release a calendar for 2017, inspired by the Pirelli calendar of the 1970s.
But instead of revealing well-known personalities, they try to find the next generation of top models for their 2017 NU calendar.
Treats President Steve Shaw told us earlier this year that his naked magazine is different from Playboy from the old school because “Playboy is for men.”
I do it for women.
Evidently, he believes that the calendar too.
“We have to go back to the display of overtime and classic nakedness, when both men and women feel pleasant and get inspired by photographs of the female body,” Shaw said in a press release.
Women want to be part of this project because it is a wonderful piece of art.
Models can send their photos online or personally during the open konkurses in Los Angeles and New York.
Where is vinyl going: who really purchases gramofon plates?
Vinyl loves lonely men in the middle age.
Before you decide to fill the comment section with peer notes under the pseudonym Not EveryoneMaleMaleMaleMaleMaleMaleMaleMaleMaleMale, we note that this statement is based on real data.
According to YouGov, so much discussed resurrection of gramofon plates is associated not with the boom of millennials who want to love the originality of possession of a physical object, but with the nostalgia of the middle age.
Those who recently bought the album on vinyl are most likely people between the ages of 45 and 54.
Young people aged 18-24 are the least likely.
It’s not actually about gathering an enthusiastic fan – all of this has an emotional dimension: older people who buy gramofon discs are more likely to want to keep their feelings (56 % versus 53 %) and love themselves (69 % versus 66 %).
But are YouGov results true?
If this blog was broadcast as a TV report, the camera would watch me as I go out into the busy street in Soho, dressed in a decent gray dress and widespread gestualization. Then I would stop, pull out my hands and say something authoritative, like: “So let’s go to see it.”
So let’s go to see it.
While Soho's heart slowly loses its charm and magic - the buildings once occupied by independent sellers, are now filled with hotels, restaurants and dining rooms, clothing and office needs - a few fantastic specialized gramofon plates still remain.
I will stand close to different men in these stores and try to notice what their age and emotional mood is.
Stuart (55), a resident of Glasgowa, whom I follow from Sister Ray (number: two young women, three men of the middle age) to Reckless Records (number: eight men of the middle age, one woman around 20) has a afternoon meeting in London and looks at the stores to fill several hours of time.
I asked him if he was a collector.
“I think yes,” he says.
I have about 3 or 4 thousand records.
All those recordings lay the walls of his living room - on the picture above (the photo was sent to me by e-mail, I didn't follow him home).
This huge number of albums and singles is also due to the fact that he can afford it: he can now buy gramofon plates that he couldn’t afford when they originally came out, and again buy what he sold in his youth and had no wind.
“A lot of what I buy is from the late 60s and the beginning of the 70s. These are things that would be issued when I was 11 or 12.
He agrees that those who buy the records are probably introverts who love the company of themselves.And he adds: “I don’t smoke and I don’t drink too much.
This is my sin.
Wez (25) works at Sister Ray and also thinks that the number of customers he meets fits into the YouGov profile.
He also noticed a new flow of people affected by the media wave. People who heard about the comeback and felt forced to buy their old gramofon plates back.
According to my interviews, people were getting rid of their collections most often between 1998 and 1999.
“Customers who once sold their gramofon plates and bought CDs are now selling their CDs to buy their gramofon plates back,” he says.
This could explain the boom of gramofon plates lovers of a certain age.
But what about the alleged emotional importance of gramofon plates?
It does not take you more than a few seconds to find in a store like Phonica that in music stores you will find a pleasant community of people with similar thoughts.
According to Weze, some older customers are troubled by the contactless payment system.
Some gramofon plates fans may feel overwhelmed in the digital world and have chosen for the well-known environment of gramofon plates packaging, things that trigger memories of peaceful adolescence.
“I think filling a gap or possessing something material can bring some comfort,” says Wez.
I am a collector and I think that is the case with a lot of people as well.
This is an easy way to fill a place in your head.
“We are all like their social workers!” hears a collaborator from a crowd of gramofon plates.
A ICM survey in April revealed that 50% of people who bought a vinyl album a month earlier have not yet listened to it.
According to the survey, 41% of respondents have a gramofon that they never use, while 7% of those who buy gramofon plates do not have a gramofon.
At this point of reporting he was probably seemed seriously concerned when browsing the crowd of compilations of bossa nova.
The aspect of “trophy” and the revitalization of interest is something Jonny (42), who works in Sounds of the Universe (number: three men of the middle age).
“Somebody recently came and said, ‘I don’t have a gramofon yet, but I want to buy it on the Radiohead plate so that we can put it on the plate,” she says.
The percentage is not large, but it is happening.
It’s more about a product page than music.
People come to us and say, “I don’t have a gramofon.”
These are younger people, not the elderly, adult puberty who get into it.
Fopp, where almost a whole floor is currently reserved for gramofon boards, has much more diverse visitors at my arrival.
There are a couple of seventy-year-olds, tourists who take pictures, puberty and middle-aged women.
While the atmosphere is not as relaxed as the stores before - from speakers instead of pulling jazz sounds the latest pop from Wild Beasts full of synthesizers and sex, it's good to see different customers.
None of them doesn’t seem lonely, but it’s hard to estimate the intriguing mental trauma when you stand next to someone for 30 seconds.
Elanora (27) walks for a few minutes in Fopp and looks at various gramofon discs at a discount.
He is one of those who is more looking at the expenses than to spend feverly.
According to his words, he doesn’t make a lot of money, so he doesn’t look into consideration that he would collect gramofon plates.
It costs a lot of money.
It’s easy to listen to music on a computer or similar. But the gramofon disks have their magic...”, he breathes with desire.
I can’t explain it – it’s unique.
My last stop is the store that allegedly inspired a new generation of gramofon fans: Urban Outfitters.
I appear to be very busy with the lights of the girls in tight jeans and I follow a group of teenage girls who are just gathering around Polaroid cameras. Then the father and daughter decide to buy a Crosley gramofon.
On the left is a staircase whose wall is covered by Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse, and Fleetwood Maca’s gramofon plates: a mixture of contemporary and classical music, the basis of any average collection of gramofon plates.
No one looks at them - just because they are just for decoration and some are so high on the wall that they cannot be reached.
It’s a “vinyl trick.”
But since any attraction to it could mean more money for the industry and send a few customers to the depths of Soho for another, there’s not much to complain about.
It is no surprise that the demographic area, where there is more likely time and money than in other areas, is also the one where the most is spent on the most luxurious goods, which vinyl is.
But while according to my findings it seems that the results of YouGov are accurate - that is, at least in gramofon plates stores, they don’t take into account a large number of collectors and vinyl lovers that actually exist, in gramofon plates stores and on online forums.
These people probably work hard in schools or offices.
He doesn’t spend the Thursday morning traveling through the gramofon boards on Berwick Street, browsing the recordings, and avoiding the sight of a strange, thirty-year-old fake TV moderator hiding behind the back of unknown men of the middle age.
The Green Horse is the Longest Living Horse (Video)
According to scientists, the Grönland sharp has the longest average life of all the vertebrates on the planet.
Julius Nielsen, who studies sharks, says that the record shows a female whose age is estimated between 272 and 512 years and measures five meters.
French court refuses to break down shops in the jungle refugee camp
A court in France has rejected the order of the Calais authorities to destroy dozens of temporary shops and restaurants in the jungle camp, where thousands of refugees live.
During the trial this week the authorities in Calais opposed that the state should be able to cancel a total of 72 provisional stores, where people inside the camp sell goods, from cigarettes to energy drinks, offer hair cutting, in provisional restaurants sell tea for 50 cents or basic dishes for a few euros.
The office of the prefect in Calais argued that places need to be destroyed because they represent a parallel economy that does not pay taxes, and because they mean the risk of fire and health risks.
Humanitarian organizations at the court said that shops and restaurants are vital and that free foods offered by state-supported associations and other groups do not provide food supplement for the growing number of refugees in the camp.
Controversial provisional stores and restaurants often provide shelter and food for people in need.
The court in Lille ruled that there was no legal basis that would prevent people from operating 72 provisional shops, but stated that the objections of the prefect Calais were “fullly understandable.”
Judge Jean-François Molla said that food stores, cafés and restaurants have a much greater role than simply serving food to people who “live in extremely desperate conditions.”
He said the spaces provide quiet places to meet refugees and volunteers.
One of the places threatened by the demolition was the camp cafe, Jungle Book Kids, which is operated by a non-profit organization and which offers 200 meals per day, hours of English and French, and asylum advice for hundreds of endangered minors without accompaniment in the camp.
More than 170,000 people have signed a petition to protect the “child’s” cafe.
The Guardian received a letter that the closure of the cafe would “be a disaster for these children, some of them are only 8 years old.”
The charitable organizations Help Refugess and L'Auberge des Migrants on Friday estimated that the number of refugees in the camp after a sharp increase in arrivals during the summer increased to more than 9,000 – the most ever since.
He thought he was dead.
The bull cries itself and the volleyball Usti.
“From March, I was able to train normally,” he at the start of the summer training in full strength.
What was you?
I had both sides of lung embolism, then because of it, heart problems.
Because when I was at a college in Korea, I didn’t know I had any blood problems.
So the difficulty caused a long flight to Asia?
I’ve been in the shell for two years and I didn’t know about it.
It hurt me, no one found me.
Then the collapse went up.
The vein is damaged, the vein will hurt all the time, especially when the weather turns or changes.
But nothing that would limit me, rather a aesthetic thing.
Are you worried about life?
had it.
Last year at the summer tournament in Dřevěnicích I didn’t know that I had an emboly, and I couldn’t move there at all.
I swallowed blood tonight.
The doctors told me that it was something completely different, I was completely cut off for five days.
I thought I was dead, my girlfriend and my family.
I have seen each other elsewhere.
How did you compare it?
Maybe I had to go up, but now it’s going up.
I know I have some blood problems, that I have to be more careful when I fly somewhere.
But everything can be done with it.
Just when I wanted to get back to the preparations last year, there were still problems with the heart.
Now everything is okay.
Since March, I have been preparing myself at home to be able to play again.
I’m physically better than before.
What do you expect from the mouth?
I'm looking forward to the party looks good, I know most of the guys.
I'm curious about the other two foreigners who will come.
I hope we are human to get it together.
Will you raise your mouth?
It had a reputation for the castle, but every season is different.
Two years ago it was eighth, now it is the second.
There is a new team and there are only a few players left.
It was the last in extralize, so there is a great space to improve.
How we use it is on us.
We’ll see who’s going to be the first round, we don’t.
Is this a guarantee of success?
He’s already experienced and experienced a lot, he’ll think of better than the last place.
But my arrival had nothing to do with it, I agreed earlier.
There were other coaches in the game, with one I was a great friend and it was agreed that he will work here.
I will not say the name.
Finally Mr. Brom came and I'm glad.
He has a great name, he has been in good clubs, he has trained a lot of decades, he is a former good player.
He moves us up.
What will you bring?
This team will fight, which is my position.
I love fighting, I love hockey and I like to get a chance in a not so top team.
I’ve been in the Pribrami for two years, but Ustí is a bigger challenge than being in the sixth team, because it starts from the bottom.
You mentioned foreigners, in Ustí already trains the Australian Boehm.
How does it look?
I know that we played against each other in a group at the university.
And we had a couple of times fun there, sometimes we sat together after the matches, so we already know each other in friendship.
We defeated them 3:1, and I got it to him at the start of the summer preparation in Ustí.
She has a Slovak girlfriend and is a gentleman.
The Americans and the Brazilians are coming.
Do you know something about them?
I wrote with a American, he looks like a good guy, a Brazilian who knows how he will speak English.
Have you contacted the Americans?
It seemed to me a good idea.
I am a recorder, that is, the one who creates, so I should communicate with everyone.
I immediately found out what it was for players, I found on the internet how he played, I saw some videos.
He was good, the boy jumped, he was high.
We wrote a few messages on Facebook, it seemed like a joke, it would fit to us.
How do you look forward to the recording position?
I didn’t want to take anything else.
I’m twenty-four years old and I don’t want to change it.
I prefer to be in the center of the event, I prefer to lead the team than someone else to lead it.
I't want to play if I should be like a second recorder and devote myself to it for full time.
How many times have you been 1st?
Half a year in Příbrami, when it didn’t go to Kust as a captain, he wounded himself, then there were problems with the money and he left.
We went up and I played all the time.
I was the one I was the one I was the one I was the one I was the one I was the one I was the one I was the one I was the one I was the one I was the one I was the one I was the one I was the one I was the one I was the one I was the one I was the one I was the one I was the one I was the one I was the one I was the one I was the one I was the one I was the one I was the one I was the one I was the one I was the one I was the one I was the one I was the one I was the one I was the one I was the one I was the one I was the one I was the one I was the one I was the one I was the one I was the one I was the one I was the one I was the one I was the one I was the one I was the one I was the one I was the one I was the one I was the one
It was a great year in the Old Town, after which I had a lot of offers and I chose just Příbram.
From there, Budějovice wanted me, I stayed, but I didn't finish the season because of that emboly.
Now it is a new beginning.
Gold number 22.
The short location remains the Phelps domain.
“To be on the winner’s stages again and to hear the hymn is sweet as always,” Phelps laughed and had eyes full of tears again.
His grandmother and mother were rejoicing in the sight, but this time the son Boomer calmly slept with headsets on his ears.
I have a wonderful week to finish my career.
It's crazy - 20 years ago I started racing swimming and in a few hours it will be over, he said impressively.
In the final after Phelps, the silver Japanese Kosuke Hagino left for almost two seconds, winning a long position.
Bronze was won by Chinese Wang Shun, the bronze medalist in this discipline from last year’s World Championship.
After Alu Oerter (disk) and Carl Lewis (distance), Michael Phelps is the third athlete to dominate the same discipline in four games in a row.
After the majority of the race, Phelps was led by the other American Ryan Lochte and the home Thiago Perreira.
While the defense of gold in the final crawler's fifty placed to the drunk finish, they fell out of the medal position.
The American superhero will have at least one chance in Rio to expand its unique medal collection.
Shortly after the ceremonial announcement of the position, he went to the final of the 100 meters race.
The legend could not be shadowed even by the cousin Ryan Murphy, who won the record double - after a hundred won in Rio and a double track.
In the final, the Australian swimmer Mitchell Larkina left 37 cents, the third ended by the Russian Jevgeny Rylov.
While from last year’s World Championship, Murphy has only a fifth place out of two hundred, in Rio he became the mark king.
From the imaginary throne he dropped Larkina, whom the same double succeeded just in last year's world championship.
At the Olympics he won the medal.
The gold was shared by Canadian Penny Oleksiak and American Simone Manuel.
For the 16 year old Oleksiak, this was the fourth medal in these games, and for Manuel, the second after silver from the staff.
Swimming gold was the first African-American woman in history.
I think I can be an inspiration for others.
“This medal is for all those who come after me, sport becomes love for them and get to where I am,” said Manuel.
The third was the Swedish Sarah Sjöström, who won the 100 meters racing in the world record in Rio, and still has a silver from the crawler two hundred.
Australia's world recordman, Cate Campbell.
Japanese Rie Kanet won the first Olympic medal in 27 years.
It has no precious metal even from the World Championship, its maximum was the fourth place in this discipline in 2013.
The second silver in Rio was won by Russia Julija Jefimov, who, despite the doping past, faces the unrighteousness of spectators and rivals.
I made a big mistake once.
But I’ve won in the court and I don’t know why I should always answer these questions.
I’m very tired of it, said a Russian swimmer.
The right to start in Rio was granted only at the special panel of sports arbitration CAS just before the start of the games.
They deal with my appeal and I won.
If someone likes it or does not, or if he has a different opinion, let him go to the arbitration court, she added.
We were disappointed, we could win.
Start at midnight?
I don’t remember it.
The Czechs had a special day.
A few hours before the match, they knew who they were against.
They had to manage the tactical preparation.
And then, in untraditional time, the game began on the small court number 1.
The first set didn't start well, then they reached the opponent's advance, but at 19:19 they failed to finish.
In the second they were clearly better and compared, but the decisive tie-break did not come out for them.
First of all, a number of showed services meant loss at 10:15 and goodbye to the Olympic tournament.
“We could have defeated the Russians,” Hermann said.
How would you evaluate the match?
Hermann: After the unfortunate start before I played, we got beautifully into the game.
At the end of the balloon I had the earnings I used to.
We lost the set, which was key.
In the next set we entered them with a overview on the field, another defense, and we pressed on the service.
In the tie-break there were terribly damaged submissions, there we took this page.
It was a disappointment because we could defeat the Russians.
I am sorry for the start of the first set, that's where we've gone.
We were able to remove it, but we missed the points.
The second set was great and in the third the service decided.
We made a lot of mistakes.
We gave them five points and about the five it was, there we had a lot of hesitation.
It’s a shame, because the Russians were playable.
How did you play in the small court number one?
Slukova: Similar to in China on the side courts.
The atmosphere and the atmosphere were different.
It was one hour in the night, full silence, music didn’t play, nothing else.
That’s the difference from the center.
We can’t choose, but we can’t choose.
What was the preparation for the match when you found the names of the opponents an hour before the match?
Hermann: It was strange.
We started training for a match without knowing the opponents, so we couldn’t do a tactical preparation like the other teams.
But Simon (Coach Nausch) prepared tactics for almost all the options that were there.
He had a lot of paper prepared with tactics, so after this page we were quite well prepared.
Do you remember starting the match at midnight?
Hermann: Maybe not.
We played at 11:30, but not at 12:30.
The Blok of the Russian Birlov in the play-off at the OH in Rio.
Beach volleyball players Markéta Sluková and Barbora Hermann in an embrace in the play-off for the OH in Rio.
Was it unpleasant?
Slukova: By playing the last two matches in the group from 10, we had a regime moved earlier.
This was about two hours more.
It’s strange, I can’t imagine that another sport has athletes who have to serve their best performance in twelve hours.
But I think we’ve prepared the best we could.
We knew it would be so, but it’s not typical and it won’t be my favorite time to play.
How do you evaluate the Olympic experience?
Hermann: Since the progress from the group was our goal, it is on the one hand okay, good.
We managed what we said.
I am sad after the match.
I’m going to sleep out of it and from tomorrow I’m going to remember the Olympic tournament only positively.
Big Brother is here, the first smiling SIM comes.
You will not escape her.
The new rules will apply to all people without a Thai passport who decide to purchase a SIM from any of the local operators during their residence in Thailand.
It is not only for tourists, but also for persons with long-term visas who, for example, work in Thailand or have married there.
The Secretary-General of the National Broadcasting Authority and Telecommunications Commission, Takorn Tantasith, said there will be no exceptions.
The SIM sales plan intended exclusively to foreigners was announced by the National Telecommunications Regulator in early August.
The authorities intend to introduce new measures to enable the monitoring of their location within six months.
According to Tantasitha, it is a means to maintain national security, which will allow to deal with the criminal activity committed by foreigners.
The so-called tourist SIMs also help to detect persons who exceed the permitted duration of their stay.
For sellers, a special SIM for foreigners should be displayed in the next six months on the side of the SIM intended exclusively for Thais.
The difference will be the tracking function, which will be permanently enabled for cards intended for people without a Thai passport.
It will not be possible to turn off.
“This feature in the SIM for Thailand is not because we can always easily track it,” Tantasith added.
It should be added that in Thailand, pre-payments are not anonymous as in the Czech Republic.
The seller requires an identity document.
On the other hand, for several years, one of the operators distributed free start-up SIM to tourists at airports.
They were completely anonymous.
The implementation of the same measure as Thailand is considered by ten telecommunications regulators from other Asian countries including Malaysia and Singapore.
There is also a compulsory SIM registration, but the legal use of the tracking system is not possible.
However, the planned measure does not imply the obligation for foreigners to acquire a local operator when entering the SIM country.
They can, of course, use roaming services with their own home SIM, in this case they will be short by Thai authorities.
Operators of the country know only the relevant network information when they have crossed the border, i.e. when the SIM is logged in to their network.
Therefore, they know the telephone number, but not the information of the owner.
However, the difference in roaming prices compared to the rates of local operators is so scarcely that the majority of tourists begin to look at local SIMs during their stay in Thailand.
The attempt of the authorities to monitor the movement of foreigners was legally criticized by foreigners living in Thailand.
Tantasith calms the situation and, in relation to privacy, the intended system compares to the obligation to provide a residence address in immigration documents.
In addition, the police will need a court order if it is necessary to monitor a particular person.
For any misuse of the system will be threatened a closer undetermined punishment.
“If a service provider will monitor the SIM location without a court order, he will be accused of a criminal offence,” Tantasith added.
In addition, the system should maximize the use of prepaid cards.
While the specific number is currently recycled only after the 90 day period after which the SIM has not logged in to the network, the new number may be recycled after 15 days if you leave Thailand.
The luxury apartment in the new building on Vinohrade has a swimming pool and a waterfront on the terrace.
Why did you choose a new apartment?
We were looking for a careless apartment where most of the property care will be carried out by the manager.
The condition was sufficient parking and elevator in the house, which essentially disqualified the older building.
Not to mention problematic acoustics in old houses, problems with floating floor, high energy efficiency and so on.
The condition was also large terraces, which the old building is unable to offer.
Other interesting visits can be found in the magazine Modern Apartment.
The whole interior for you was designed by architect Lenka Langer with her colleague Kamil Polakova from the studio Artiga.
Why did you address them just?
Would you recommend collaboration with a specialist to everyone?
Collaboration with the architect we would recommend to everyone, if he proposes an apartment from the beginning, it is a very complex technical process.
The second level is the interior design itself: designers have a significantly better idea of the range of possible materials and on the basis of the customer's wish they are able to fit the interior properly.
We worked with architect Lenka Langer already in our mountain apartment, then on the basis of the personal recommendation of another customer, and given that everything worked well, it was a clear choice for us even when we reconstructed our new apartment in Vinohrade.
What are your practical and aesthetic requirements?
We wanted a generous social-residential space with an appropriate background for a four-member family conceived as a modern but not cool interior.
The priority was to connect the apartment with the terraces and implement the smart control of the household.
And of course, the quality of the implementation was to be carbonated.
Have you left everything on the experts, or have you interfered in the final shape of the interior?
We approved all the designs including technical drawings and samples of materials, however the design always came from the architects.
At the beginning, we set out what we expect from the design, and showed some elements of the interior that we would like to incorporate into the design, for example, carpets or paintings.
I think that our collection of mostly Czech authors including works of Karl Malich, Karl Vysušil, Václav Špály or Otto Gutfreund architecture helped to orient in our taste.
Also the combination of black, white and nuts wood was the idea of architecture as well as individual pieces of furniture, walls, floors, lighting, carpets, textiles, art, etc. The fact that everything fits together, we then jointly verified using visualizations.
Did any complications occur during the implementation, why you had to give up the original ideas, or, on the contrary, approach the new ones?
Per just in the initial phase of the project, when we came to the building at the moment it was possible to climb to the height of our floor, and found that the views we planned, in fact, shadowed the surrounding building.
Then we changed the disposition literally overnight from the basis.
On the kitchen line and on the cover of the firewall was used a grape.
In the interior then dominate wooden surfaces supplemented with skin, for example, on the standing of food and bar chairs Norma from Arper.
How do you characterize the interior?
Are you planning on a change or is there something you would like to have differently today?
I think it’s a modern air interior that first and foremost fulfils its purpose.
We are not going to make changes, most of the adjustments after moving took place in the shadows and terraces.
Per the only excuse is to the floor, when nuts trees appear to us as too sensitive to the home with a dog.
Word of Architects, Ing. Arch. Lenka Langer and Mg. Kamila Hornych, author of the realization.
The apartment is in the last floor of the new building, so it was possible to make a completely new available solution and several further adjustments within the building.
For the interior, an important element is the placement of the lights in the roof of the corridor and the main toilet.
So we get the daylight to the darker space of the apartment.
Also direct entrance from the main bathroom to the roof terrace to the pool from USSPA is one of the building adjustments that was very beneficial for the function of the entire apartment.
There is also a swimming pool and a waterfall.
In comparison with the French you are not negative, says a Muslim living in Prague.
You are from France.
Where did you live before you moved to Prague?
My parents are from Algeria.
I was born in the south of France, a bit from the Spanish border.
I moved quite a lot.
I lived in Toulouse, Lyon and Marseille.
I studied journalism in France, and then I got to work in a magazine.
Why did you decide to leave the country?
I started to feel like I was in France.
I just didn’t want to live there anymore.
Especially because of the atmosphere.
Every French is very negative.
People in France are negative in general, but recently it has worsened.
Interestingly, you are talking about negativity.
This is how many people think of the Czech nature.
You are not negative compared to the French.
Some people may not be able to do so when they come to France because they don’t see it as much as tourists.
But for me it was too much.
Money is a big topic.
People feel like they have little money, while the minimum wage in France is fifteen hundred euros, which I think is enough.
Now there is also a problem with the behavior of people towards Muslims.
This is completely incomprehensible for me.
For example, in the street in which I lived, my non-Muslim neighbor began to look at me through the fingers just because I was a Muslim.
As if I was a evil.
I didn’t feel good in France.
My family stayed there.
So you decided to go to another country.
Why did you choose the Czech Republic?
I was looking for a job anywhere else and I found a vacancy with Air France here in Prague.
I acknowledge that I didn’t know from the beginning.
I knew something about the Czech Republic, my father even told me what was happening in Czechoslovakia, but I didn’t know what to expect from Prague.
I’ve been here for three years and I can’t imagine I’d not live here.
Was it a big difference when you moved from France to Prague?
Especially because of a different atmosphere.
Maybe it’s because I don’t speak Czech, so I can’t catch some negative reactions or insults, but I feel that people are more free here.
I can do anything, wear anything, and no one will judge me.
In France, someone is still looking unpleasant at you, for example when you have special clothes and so on.
I started to feel very free in Prague.
I don’t think the people care about such things.
Where are you working now?
After working at Air France, I worked for one travel site for a while.
Then we and one friend set up a website where people offer and look for shared housing.
Until now, we are only working in Prague, but we want to expand it to the whole of Central Europe.
Do you have any Czech friends in Prague?
I have two very close friends here, who are Czechs in half, and two other Czechs friends.
I have to say that the other specification of the Czechs is that they keep the distance more in the beginning.
They don’t let anyone go to the body.
This is quite different from where I grew up.
In the south, everyone hugs and kisses on the face.
This is different, but I understand that it is a cultural matter, so I try to adapt it.
You said you don’t speak Czech.
Is language barrier a problem for you?
I think it’s very simple because everyone here speaks English.
Even at dinner or in food.
I want to learn English, but I don’t have enough time.
And by being able to communicate at least a little in English, I don’t have such a need to learn a language quickly.
Every time I have a problem, I find someone to help me.
Do you have any negative reactions?
Per because you are a Muslim.
Basically not.
Per it is also because I work in an international environment that is more tolerant.
One experience is touching me.
My leader, Czech, once told me about the French football team and said something in the sense: They are not the French, but the African.
That touched me quite.
But if someone had a problem with being a Muslim, it didn’t happen to me yet.
And this, even though a colleague once warned me of some anti-Muslim demonstrations.
He said I shouldn’t go to the center, that they’ll get me there.
Anti-Muslim demonstrations are partly related to terrorist attacks.
How does the current situation affect you?
Are you afraid that something like Paris, Nice or Brussels can happen in Prague?
I feel safe in Prague.
But the problem is that nowadays anything can happen anywhere.
Until recently, I could not imagine that something like this would happen in France.
This is not just for Muslims.
Islam does not recognize violence at all.
For me the people who kill are not Muslims.
The Qur’an says that man has no right to kill because he is not God.
How do you see that when terrorists protect themselves by your faith?
It is very difficult.
I feel shame and guilt, even if I shouldn’t feel like that.
I try not to follow the news of violence, but every time I read something, I need to apologize for something that is not my fault.
I am a different person, so why should I apologize for the terrorists?
We met on the square of Jiří z Poděbrad.
On Wednesday, Muslims and Christians protested against violence.
Have you registered it?
I didn’t know about it.
But I understand that these people feel the need to prove that they disagree with violence.
I don’t think they should do something like that.
Why should they feel guilty for something they did not cause?
Do you meet in Prague and other Muslims?
My collaborators are from Egypt and other Muslim countries.
There are a little more religious foundations than me, so we sometimes have quite wild discussions about Islam because we all perceive it a little differently.
I came from France, so I went through a different education, they had taught Islam at school.
We have different approaches, but we respect each other.
People sometimes link Islam with the subordinate position of women.
How do you see it?
I don’t seem subordinate in any way.
rather the opposite.
I am a woman, I have strength.
This also means you don’t have a head cover.
For instance, a hijab?
This is mainly the way I was raised.
My mother, for example, is a truly fundamental Muslim.
They pray five times a day, but they simply don’t wear the sheet.
She always taught me that faith is a purely personal thing.
It depends on everyone how they interpret it.
When you read the Qur’an, you should make your own opinion.
So when I read the passage in the Qur’an that says that God told the Prophet to hide his wives from the eyes of others, I said to myself, “I am not the wife of the Prophet, so why should I hide?”
On the other hand, I respect it, and when I arrive in Iran or Saudi Arabia, where the shakes are required, I will take it.
Are you planning to stay in Prague?
So far yes.
I didn’t feel so good anywhere else.
I thought about Poland for a while, but in Prague it was great for me.
I can even imagine that I would raise my own children here.
Prague is the ideal city.
Muslims and Christians protest against violence.
Jachtařku Kozelskou Fenclovou wind in Rio swallowed on progressive edges.
On Friday on the sea in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, the Czech yacht maker Veronice Kozelské Fenclové.
In the Laser Radial class, she moved to the 10th place before the final two rounds.
That would ensure the Czech participation in the final race.
Packages are picked up like Pokémon.
They want to compete with carriers.
The idea to take advantage of the already planned routes for the transport of ships is TV director Matěj Liška and manager of the Prague Music Club Marek Greger.
With the idea, three applications with a different geographical reach inhaled the life.
We launched the National Transfer app in May.
At the moment there are thousands of cities recorded in it and we will expand the network.
In the Czech Republic, we want to learn first, rather than focus more on abroad, says the fourteen-year-old manager in an interview with Today.com.
How does the application work and who can benefit from it?
You can download it and register for free.
Then you can enter the route and the details of how big the package you can carry and how much you want it.
Someone might ask for transport on that day.
When the route and delivery time meet, it is matched and both will receive mutual notification.
At that moment, the chat will open, where the couple will agree on the delivery.
How many people would you expect to register in order for each package to always find its courier?
I don't know the ideal state, I can't estimate how many registered and how many routes are needed to make the coverage quite optimal and each offer is matched with demand.
It is logically easier than on the road between the villages.
The more people, the greater the potential for speed and accuracy.
People also build confidence and find that no one will escape with the package.
Have you not had to deal with such a case?
How many users have the service after two months of launch?
Currently, we have about 5 to 6 thousand people who are creating roads.
We see this as a success and we believe that there will be more.
Is it not necessary that the sender will wait too long?
We hope that we will be a competitor for the big conglomerates just because we are able to deliver the thing on the same day and for a fraction of the price.
At a large company for delivery within two hours you will pay several thousand.
You’ll pay a hundred and a hundred and a hundred and a hundred and a hundred and a hundred and a hundred and a hundred and a hundred and a hundred and a hundred and a hundred and a hundred and a hundred and a hundred.
Should traditional carriers be concerned about a potential loss of customers in the future?
We hope that it will be so.
The market has huge potential, huge multinational carriers are feeding here, as well as trade chains, where they all started shopping and gradually discovered that quality does not match what they pay for.
No one wants to find in the box of tickets with a message that he has to pick up the shipment at the branch, not earlier than that day after 19 p.m.
At that time I needed the package for six hours and I was waiting at home because it was important.
We want a better, faster and functional service that will not shake anyone and send the competition signal, let him try.
Marek Greger (41) and Matěj Liška (39).
No one has ever worked in the information technology industry.
Marek Greger works as the manager of the music club, Matěj Liška as a television director.
In 2014, they started preparing the Shippansee LTD app, which uses for package transportation the already planned routes between the world’s metropolities, especially by aircraft.
In 2015, they assigned the project to the processing company, which created applications for MALL.cz, Jobs.cz or ČSFD.
The programming lasted three quarters of the year and the application was launched in March 2016.
The Transmission application began to develop in December of last year and was released in May of this year.
This is a local version of Shippansee modified for the Czech market.
The Moon and Moon Profi app has been developed since January of this year and made available to users at the end of July 2016.
The intention was from the beginning to make all these applications, which one day will be combined into one.
In the Czech Republic, they want to do the application and then, in cooperation with a strong investor, focus more on the global market.
Shared economy is a topic in recent times and this is the service of the type AirBnB or Uber.
Do you not worry about the action in a area that no one can tell much about, where the boundaries of sharing are and where the grey economies are?
It is the same, just a different product.
It is clear to us that if it succeeds and we go up with it, we will be another thunder in the eye through the grey economy.
But even if someone saves and someone earns, it is not intended to escape financial authorities and tax controls.
Each user, either on the one or the other side, will be encouraged to tax his income if he makes his income.
What do you think is that the company has such a great potential?
The sender will save and the carrier will earn, respectively, reduce the cost of the journey.
This is the strong idea that connects interest on both sides.
In the time of social networks that divide people, we would like this to get closer.
There can be nice stories, people are happy to have helped someone and will tell them about it.
For example, someone will bring you forgotten glasses, keys or pills.
I think people have been missing personal access for a long time, about this application we say it is the service of people to people.
So how do you guarantee that the courier with the package does not breathe?
Each user of the application, together with the registration, scans the citizen’s card and indicates the bank connection, payment or credit card.
These are channels that give the service and the man credibility.
The courier also collects the stars on the basis of the sender’s reviews.
We also offer insurance, and we provide details.
For unassured shipment in case of loss or damage lies the courier, but does not assume liability according to criminal law for the content, if there is something illegal inside and does not know about it.
If he is stopped by the police and he finds a firearm or ten kilograms of hashish in a closed package in his suitcase, the criminal responsibility is transferred to the sender.
Is there a risk of misuse of sensitive data from a database?
Registrations are, if necessary, searchable by the administrative authority, which as the only one will have the opportunity to see them, nor we ourselves are unable to see them, the data is against abuse protected.
How much money will the courier receive after a successful delivery of the shipment to the hand?
The courier determines the price and receives the whole amount he says.
Additionally, a number of per cent are charged for the contact.
This money is our profit, but it’s just a few percent because we want to push on the volume.
The courier can also no one accuse that the shipment has not been delivered when it is actually delivered, the receipt and delivery is verified using QR codes.
Are there any restrictions?
What about the size or content of the package?
You can take anything.
We have three sizes, small as a cup of butter, medium as a plate of eggs, and large as a bass beer.
There is no further restriction and if someone has a place in the car, they take the refrigerator.
Plus the sender has the option in the package application to photograph, so the courier sees what he wants.
You don’t even need to pack the stuff if you don’t want to hide the content.
The forgotten micina you put the courier in your hand and it is.
Who came with the idea and how long it took to launch the service?
My friend got the idea more than two years ago, then I didn’t pay much attention to it.
Then he showed me a demo application with a multinational reach that is mainly targeted on passengers by aircraft.
At that moment I told him I’d not look for an investor, but I’d like to become an investor and save it.
The next year took development before we founded the Shippansee LTD in London due to the greater credibility of the whole product.
But this is not the version you are focusing on.
No, marketing we focused on the Czech Republic, where we try to catch the application, because it all had birth pain and still there is something to solve and improve.
We are trying to respond to customer feedback and the foreign market at the moment we are not solving so much.
We know that it’s a run on a long track, but we don’t want, we want to create a really good product for people.
Shippansee LTD was the basic and most expensive application, the other two were upgrade in a way.
The transfer came up when we said that the national segment could be much more interesting and that we will at least learn in the Czech Republic.
The third application of the moon is local, for the city.
But he can send the package to the exact address and to the other end of the world.
It works for senders as well as Transfer, but the difference is that in it as a courier you see shipping in the form of points on the map that are the closest to you, thanks to the geolocator in the mobile.
Applications for the courier who want to feed on it, we called the Moon Profi.
So can anyone make a lot of money by picking up the packages in the city?
Exactly, the latest application will be downloaded in Prague for example a taxi driver, a student, a mother on parental leave, someone who wants to get the way to work.
As everyone is fooling with these Pokémon now, they can gather all the same.
A person sees where the city is the orders, comes to it, clicks and sees when it must be delivered and the shipment takes over.
It is set cheaper than competitive services.
At the moment we are still making a web interface that will be key for companies to send shipments, on the web they will fill out data about them, i.e. they will create points on the map.
We are then able to calculate their use of the service for example every month.
Are you engaged in the full-time project?
It costs us, but we have it normally at work so that we can feed and develop the project.
It’s not hiding behind us a strong multinational investor, we’re two guys, one of whom had a genius idea and the other jumped into it with other incentives and ideas.
Now we are looking for an investor strong enough to manage the Czech market, but who should go with us into a global product and become another huge player on the market like AirBnB and Uber.
The story part of Titanfall 2 is about to bring almost forgotten diversity.
This will fix the second part and the solo game in it will be, according to the first information, more diverse than in Call of Duty.
The length will be around the standard eight hours and the filling will be based on the concept of networking in the first part.
Therefore, you can enjoy the freedom of movement, which in addition to running includes the possibility of using the battle titanium.
In addition to action passages, the game will also contain levels focused just on the brave movement.
They will remind platforms and include rebus.
To overcome them are therefore essential, for example, double jumping, running on the walls and wire sliding.
Sometimes there will be a need to destroy enemies.
There will be no missing maps that remind the lab and levels with special concepts.
In one, for example, it will be possible to lift and shut the platforms and close the huge door.
So you will manage the form of the battlefield.
The pace of the game, thanks to this, should oscillate between the angry action and the quieter moments for exploring the unknown planet.
We’re going to play as Jack Cooper dreaming of his career as a pilot.
Cooper at the start of the campaign, along with Captain Lastimosa, crashed on the alien planet Typhon, inhabited by enemy soldiers.
And there will not be any wildness to him.
In addition, Lastimosa will suffer deadly wounds in the accident, and Cooper will be charged with operating the captain's titan.
His dream of a pilot career will be fulfilled sooner than he expected.
The first step, however, will be the steal of the battery needed for the robot repair.
It will also be important for Coopera to get titanium.
Players will serve as a source of information about the soldier's past, but at the same time, a robot-isolated communication will create humorous moments.
For example, when the titanium will dry list all the injuries that Cooper is threatened at the planned jump.
The first information about the Titanfall 2 campaign was brought by the Polygon server.
In addition, the result will be possible to evaluate in two months, and Bonusweb will bring you the first impressions of the online game after Gamescom.
Titanfall 2 will be released on October 28 for PC, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.
The THQ brand will survive, but the original publishing company remains dead.
The Swedish company Nordic changed its name to THQ Nordic.
After the collapse of the publishing company, THQ in 2013 obtained a number of its brands and the right to use the logo and the name of the company.
Nordic has released Darksiders 2 Deathnitive Edition and Red Faction Collection.
In addition, there are 23 new games for the publisher, 13 of which the company has not yet revealed.
Thirty years ago, when I retired, my wife, after thirty years of marriage, found a twenty-year younger man, our neighbor.
I knew it from the beginning - first it was obviously tried for a long time, then they got together.
He is such a great guy, probably her type, because she walked with the same before me.
He was completely crazy in him.
In those first days, her voice even changed, she had such a girl, in love sound.
But when I told her I knew what was happening, she denied it.
I watched it all.
He then went out of work regularly at half a quarter, so she always went out at three for shopping.
Every day she tried to see him at least.
I later found out that they met with him in the house, in the washroom.
How many times I knew they were there.
I took the keys and decided to get them there.
But I don’t know why, I’ve always been sitting at home.
I have never been able to go there, take the decisive step.
You may laugh to me, but I believe that my wife controlled me thoughtfully.
Soon I think she found out that I am controllable, that I will do what she will want.
And I really did it.
Maybe I’m just such a puppy.
The neighbors told me that they knew it too.
I was so stupid that I never asked them what to do.
I was afraid that if it all broke, it would be bad.
That it would happen to everyone in the family, only the daughter knew.
So I always delayed it, on and on.
One day, I went to his apartment and asked for help in the washing room.
He went there with me and I told him that I got anonymous, that he is meeting with my wife and that he all indicates that.
I asked him what he would tell me about it.
He stood there, scratched his shoulders, looked into the ground and did not say a word.
Then I also once met his wife on the way out of the shop.
I told her, but she didn’t believe it at all.
She didn’t respond to it and didn’t tell me anything.
No one told me at that time.
I am such a man who has never gone anywhere too much, who has trouble getting to know someone, even finding a woman.
I didn’t even think about divorce.
I still trusted that one day it would end.
I thought I would forgive her and life would go on.
But it was not so.
And I’ve never faced with all that in essence.
So far I have it in me.
In the past, I’d often showed it to her, but in the end I left it for peace.
He still lives in the neighboring house and I still live with her.
It’s just more than my wife my hostess.
At home she always did everything - cooked, washed, cleaned.
She is working.
I always tried to make no other reason to complain.
It can be said that it is also good.
But sometimes I would like to embrace her, embrace her, and she won’t let.
We’re walking and shopping together, and everyone thinks what a happy marriage is.
She once told me she never loved me.
She loved me, but she didn’t love me.
And I see that he loves him until today, it is his god.
I am so tired of life.
When it started and I had it very badly, I once told her I didn’t want to live and I asked what she would say if I had finished.
I wanted to know if he would agree or not.
And that’s what I wanted to hear from her: Yes or No.
But she thought and said, “But there’s plenty of room here.”
Prime Minister Manuel Valls wants to establish a new French Islamic Foundation to serve as a bridge between the state and its Muslim inhabitants.
After the terrorist attacks, France intensifies the fight against radical Islamists and the government and the local Muslim minority are calling for help.
“If Muslims themselves don’t help the state against those who violate public freedom, it will be more and more difficult for France to guarantee their freedom of religion,” Prime Minister Manuel Valls said.
It intends to ensure that only spiritual education in France is predicted in the country.
He also wants to stop the financing of mosques from abroad, where with money often come preachers vaccinated with jihad.
In October, Valls wants to establish a new French Islamic Foundation to serve as a bridge between the state and its Muslim inhabitants.
The new institution will replace the current French Foundation for Islam, which was founded in 2005 by then Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin.
It had already contributed to the transparency of the financial flows between the mosques and the countries that finance their construction.
But soon it was affected by internal contradictions, and it never worked properly.
“It’s a total failure,” Valls said.
The new foundation will probably be led by the former Minister of the Interior and Defense Jean-Pierre Chevènement, who is known as a supporter of the secular state.
There are approximately 2500 mosques and prayers in France, about 120 of which serve radical Islamism.
Since 2012, the French authorities have expelled about 80 Muslim priests from the country, and several other dozen are considering this step.
This week, the German police also attacked the jihadists.
The Imams allegedly verbed the fighters for the Islamic State.
One of them operated a space where believers allegedly radicalized and later attacked the Sikh temple in Essen.
Immediately after the Charlie Hebdo attacks in January 2015, a debate in France on a new institution that will replace the unfunctional foundation began.
Everything has been accelerated by further terrorist attacks carried out by radical Islamists on behalf of the Islamic State.
The new foundation will have two main tasks – to ensure the financing of mosques from domestic resources and also to oversee the imams.
It is not yet clear where it will get the funds, although several proposals are being considered.
One of them is a special fee for halal foods, i.e. mainly for meat derived from defeats according to Islamic principles.
This tax would in practice be paid by halal food sellers, and that for granting permission.
Some of the money would then go to the foundation’s budget.
A contribution of €10 to €20 could also be paid by French travelers who go to Mecca.
Every year, about 30,000 people travel from France to Saudi Arabia.
In addition, in the French mosques should only be practitioners who have passed educational programs at the universities there.
Thus, their preaching should be in accordance with democracy.
The government also closed radical mosques.
“From December, we have closed 20 of them and others will follow,” Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve said.
“There is no place in France for those who declare hatred and do not respect the principles of our country, such as equality between women and men,” he said.
of Zaragoza.
His ex-wife was seriously injured by an unknown shooter on Friday morning in a shopping center in northern Zaragoza, the newspaper reports.
The shooting took place after a woman and her daughter left the garage in their car.
The man was waiting in the car in front of the shopping center, where he also started shooting.
According to witnesses, the man then turned the weapon against himself, writes Independent.
The woman was taken to the hospital by an injured daughter, for a man in critical condition, an ambulance had to come.
The incident occurred around 11:00 in the central part of the metropolitan autonomous area of Aragon, near the local university.
With reference to the Spanish agency Europa Press, Independent writes that the motivation was probably the unresolved recent divorce of the two partners.
Závitky with chest, wakame rays, zinc and chilli sauce.
The summer desires light, well digestive meals, but we Czechs are rebels and we have our own taste and our own head.
And so from the summer gardens the smell of grilled cabbage, cabbage, pig cabbage.
Nothing too healthy, nothing too light, even so sometimes with the exception of salad or baked vegetables.
Truth, grilling is time-saving and dishes, in addition, it is a social matter and no one needs to be closed in the kitchen.
But there are other alternatives, how to make good foods, which special meals, their preparation represents a small ritual, but at the same time it is not necessary to cook, bak, smell or sweat.
It will also contribute to our health.
Whether it is a home sushi or sashimi, where quality raw materials and a couple of well-adopted grifes are enough to make the preparation fun and the food itself a real exotic flavor.
Just like even easier rolls in rice paper from today's recipe.
There is even a time-consuming cooking and cooling of rice.
The paper can only be soft in the water for a moment, and then it is only the imagination of the chef, how he intends to play with the fillings and accessories.
It is not like a rainbow.
The advantage of a number of dishes of Asian cuisine today is that the raw materials are normally already commonly available.
In addition to filled sweet-acid ginger, which is one of the basic flavours accompanying sushi or fresh rolls.
You can prepare it at home, but the real pink gary ginger has a unique picant sharp and, at the same time, delicious taste thanks to the secret recipe, according to which it is mixed from several types of ointment and ginger.
Therefore, it is enough to buy a suitcase of size, and the attachment with proven antibacterial effects, which supports digestion and resistance to cough or flu, is ready.
Banana leaves.
They are used in Buddhist and Hindu cultures in serving and decorating dishes within a variety of ceremonial occasions and rituals.
The long brown banana leaves are widely used in a number of countries in Asia and South America as a "help" for the preparation of a variety of baked, cooked and fried meals, which are packed in them similarly to the alobal.
The banana sheet then gives the dish a specific taste.
They can be purchased in stores with exotic fruits and vegetables, even pre-cutting in the shape of wheels.
But choose only the leaves saturated green, and thus healthy - unbroken and without spots.
Similarly easy is the preparation of salad from wakame, sezam and sezam oil.
You can buy it frozen again.
Whoever often eats or prepares sushi, probably will know especially the rias nori.
In Japan, it is one of the most important species of seafood, from which it is produced by cutting, pressing and drying the so-called nori leaves – thus plates intended for the production of sushi.
Wakame – a dark-green rice growing in the waters around Hokkaido – is also fresh and dried and is as popular as nori rice.
By the way, who would not know the miso soup with wakame, allegedly it is used by Asian women for a long time for recovery after childbirth.
And it has almost miraculous effects.
It cleans the blood, strengthens the blood circulation, even allegedly prevents grey hair and is literally filled with minerals.
Dried and dissolved wakame also serves as spices, for example, to taste rice.
The fresh rays are first left in the water, then washed, placed in the boiling water and cooked for half a minute.
Then it is cooled in ice water, the central ribs are cut out and further adjusted, for example, as a favorite salad.
However, buying it ready, frozen, is the easiest solution.
Therefore, it remains only to moisturize the roll with a easy vegetable fill, delicious and light, full of healthy flavours.
A bomb of longevity.
If you resist and don’t get extra grilled.
Eat healthy, light and summerly.
The Asian people know how to do it.
Just a few special raw materials and a bit of skill, and you have interesting fresh food that deliciously combines the taste.
It is finished once and twice.
Four pieces of rice paper, 40 g of carrots, 40 g of white rice, 100 g of green crust, 60 g of salad corn, 60 g of wakame rice and 60 g of sweet chilli sauce.
A hole of cut koriander, a teaspoon of black sezam, a teaspoon of sriracha chilli sauce, 20 g of manga and 40 g of carved gary ginger, a bit of pini nuts.
First we prepare the boxes.
Drink the rice paper for five seconds in cold water.
Then we take it out and wait until it gets soft.
Meanwhile, in hot water, we shortly cook cranberries, after approximately three minutes, let them quickly cool into ice water so that they don’t lose color.
On the permitted paper, we put a fill of vegetables and pack.
The filling is prepared from white red, carrots and salad corns, which we cut into subtle nuts, mix them with a sweet chilli sauce, add the coriander, thoroughly mix and put on rice paper.
On the banana leaf, we put the cranberries, add the cranberries and, at the end, we decorate the whole dish with a wakame grass, a ginger, a manga plate, a black sezam, and add a couple of pineapple nuts.
Britain has to be satisfied with silver in the seventh rugby, Fiji's choice takes gold
The impressive performance of the United Kingdom in the seventh rugby ended with a destructive track on the last obstacle, Fiji defeated in the final match on Thursday evening the British at the Deodoro stadium here in Rio high 43:7.
The Fijians showed the master's lesson in processing, sliding, sliding, supporting game, running on the line and brutal forces - and they won gold, their first Olympic medal at all.
The defeat came with an unprecedented prize of comfort in the form of a silver medal - for Britain third on that day - and the British could be proud of their performance in the inaugural Olympic tournament of the seventh rugby, defeating New Zealand, Argentina and the South African Republic.
The victory over South Africans 7:5 in the semi-finals on the same day, is probably frozen in the final.
However, Fiji would be defeated by a team of 15 members in full health.
Not to write it for the British though it will not be a comfort, but they can be glad that at least one of them will have a gold medal around their neck tomorrow: the main coach of the Fijians is Ben Ryan, the former chief of England from Wimbledon.
The United Kingdom has offended a bit of the road.
Eight years ago, under the leadership of Ryana, they lost every match in Adelaide Sevens.
They lost the only one.
This defeat is painful, but progress is irreversible.
Fiji began magnificently, the penetrations of the British reflected for joy.
For Captain Tom Mitchell and other co-players it was like running behind a series of buses in motion and the world cup champions led 5-0 when Osea Colinisau emerged behind the corner.
The timer showed four minutes and Jerry Tuwai added another down on the right wing from which the conversion was.
12:0 and Britain hardly touched the ball.
The great Mitchel tried to stop the huge Leon Nakarawu and prevent him from scoring for the third time, but only Fiji slowed down.
In the seventh minute, Jasa Veremalua threw the touchdown to the right corner and the British lost 17-0.
Nakarawa added another after returning and on the hours still left more than 1 minute ... from the first half.
Vatemo Ravou then penetrated through the little Brits and attributed himself to the lajna, where he scored.
After the conversion to 29:0, a break was followed.
It was as if the Fiji for the ragby 7s was born, while the British were still learning to transmit.
Exactly this way it is.
The British made massive changes after half a time and the Fiji's attack stopped ... for a long four minutes, which was good compared to the first half until Fiji's brilliant interplay Joshua Tuisov continued.
Dan Norton tried to get a chance for the British, throwing the touchdown into the left corner to raise an 36:7. the match was already long won by the inhabitants of the Pacific Islands and their fans on the mouths sing, flags and danced.
It was difficult not to admire the completely delighted approach of the Fijians.
In the last few minutes, Mata Viliame made another attempt to win the Fijians.
The fighters hugged themselves, and the Brits fell on the grass completely shaken.
Even before that same day, Fiji in the semi-finals defeated Japan 20:5 and the United Kingdom defeated the South African Republic in the narrow semi-finals - the difference of one conversion.
Kyle Brown got the South Africans in the first half to lead, but Dan Norton, thanks to his glorious footwork, broke the defense line and scored in the second half under the hole.
The great late breakdown of Marcus Watson, Anthony's brother from the fifteen-year-old team of England, guaranteed the victory - and in the end also the silver medal.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning to win in the space race inspired the coach's fight against cancer
In these Games you won’t find more emotional gold – and that’s what to say.
From the first recording to the last, during 220 punishing outdrawals into history, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found another significance in their golden moment at Estacio de Lagoa.
While there were two seats, there were three voices in the boat. When the boat swallowed on the level in front of the second Olympic gold in a women's pair race, the voice of the still present coach Robin Williams was still with them in the boat. They are the first women in the history of British sport to such a result.
Their superiority was absolute, overall it was their 39th race, in which they remained unbeatable.
What we see - two excellent athletes as they fly over the water level with the elegance of the puppy - does not reflect the nature of the victory completely.
Behind every golden medal of winning is a batalion of assistant hands, which a bit by a bit means a difference. And no hands were assistant more than the hands of a coach who 30 months ago didn’t know if he would live this day when he was diagnosed with cancer.
According to him, it was uncertain.
I suffered from bladder cancer, which can be operated, and I was undergoing this operation.
Without an operation anything could happen.
It would be a very bad situation.
This will change your view of the matter.
Williams was diagnosed with cancer in December 2013.
The luck for the whole trio was that he could start treatment at the beginning of 2014, outside the season, and thus shorten the break to a minimum - if we can call it so under such circumstances.
I needed to make money so I had to get together quickly.
It was an incentive.
I was in the hospital and I walked around the room - 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet at a time when they said that a few steps were enough.
This was how it began.
Wedding in itself is a way, but this was a little more challenging.
Immediately after the victory, their first thoughts were about William, who was very nervous in the morning, speaking less than usual as he tried to manage his own anxiety.
Stanning, the captain of the Royal Armor Regiment, who has a mission in Aghanistan, said: “This week I was with emotions at the bottom, maybe it’s a bit extreme, but it means so much.”
It again emphasizes how much it means to me, how much we worked with Helen and Robin as well.
So far, it was three fantastic years with Helen and Robin.
Without Robin we would not be anyone, so he belongs to a huge thanks, he is the best coach in the world.
I couldn’t want a better coach or a better coach.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning did not lose a single race in five years.
The couple had an amazing rhythm that their rivals couldn’t deal with.
Even in the final 500 meters, when crews from New Zealand and Denmark began to approach, Stanning and Glover had a very large reserve.
We were focused at the maximum at that moment.
Helen screamed, “Don’t stop, don’t stop.”
It is really important not to get caught.
We had a good start and at the same time we didn’t want to something famous.
We didn’t look forward to today’s fireplace, we just wanted to get well, go out and win the race, which we succeeded.
The couple will take a year to think before they decide what will happen next.
Glover marries next week, with television adventurer Steve Backshall.
He wants to enjoy that moment.
I didn’t think this was my last race.
This would mean too much pressure.
It took about six months in London to find out that I was an Olympic champion.
Everything was so new and I was so stressed.
It took about four minutes here.
I feel much better,” she said.

The Prison?
Rather, let people drive for free, says the taxi hunter Rubeš to a breakdown accusation.
Six taxi drivers and a former magistrate officer in Prague are accused.
You’ve filmed a number of reports in which you’ve revealed fraudulent practices as well as those to be in a group that will happen before the court.
You have faced a few unpleasant confrontations with revealed actors.
How much is the report on the accusation of members of the organized group for you a breakthrough?
I thought there would be a trial.
I am mostly curious about the judgment.
I don’t think they should be in prison.
This is to nothing.
First of all, they should return all the stolen money.
And they should return them so that they will drive all the people for free.
This is a slightly overwhelming solution.
Does this mean that the possible punishment is not considered sufficiently effective?
For me it is enough that some of them are so afraid that they don’t do that job anymore.
For example, one makes a pingle, the other breaks a pizza, and one has gotten out of it.
The accused can be sentenced to two to eight years in prison.
Do you think that is an adequate rate?
I have a problem with freedom.
I consider it a bad punishment.
Getting someone in jail, especially in such a case, is absurd.
Such people should return to the society they took it.
For a quarter of a century they did that of destroying our country’s name and stupidly stealing people.
So let them now make a good visit card and deliver people for free.
I can’t imagine it differently.
This would serve as a public service.
As someone goes to collect waste, they would get a car and free would drive people around Prague.
No, I really think they will eventually get a condition and it will matter to them.
They find a different way to cheat.
He studied at the Film Academy of Miroslav Ondříčka in Písku and subsequently at the University of Tomáše Bati in Zlín.
It belongs to people who in the Czech Republic started with viral videos and videos directly for the web.
He works as a editor for Internet TV Stream.com, where he participates in a number of shows, now prepares the Prague Guide, which is intended primarily for foreign viewers.
Those Rubeš in the form of short reports advises which services in Prague prefer to avoid and which, on the contrary, recommends to use without worries.
Previously he filmed a series titled How to do it, City of fraud?, Life in luxury, and enough! and Prague vs. Money.
They are referred to as an organized group.
The police watched him for a few months.
Can such a network of fraudulent taxi drivers be called a mafia?
They are such sweet mafia, not such as we know from Kmotra.
It’s more about the mafia – the junior, but organized are.
It is only in the fact that they watch each other by the staphels (taxi stations).
Prague is completely divided.
I found that, for example, the main station doesn’t like Paris, Paris doesn’t like taxi drivers waiting at the Karlovy Lázní (disco club)
Everyone is looking for their own place and each group is organized.
It is a blurred network.
There are only seven people accused, six taxi drivers and one former magistrate officer who warned the drivers of the controls.
As you say, unwanted phenomena have not disappeared from the streets.
What is the percentage of taxpayers in Prague according to your estimate?
This is a very small percentage.
The worst people on the street are still there.
For instance, I am talking about Rihanna.
This is a man who is really dangerous - he carries a telescopic car in his car, and every Friday and Saturday he stands at the Karl Bridge and carries people.
When I went with him for the last time, he wanted me seven hundred in three kilometers.
The police did not arrest him for any reason.
There were only a few people from the whole group.
The same situation occurs in other places in Prague.
Therefore, the accusation of seven people is difficult to remove the already famous Prague nonsense, which seems to have much greater dimensions.
Of course, it is absolutely nothing.
It will help, but all evil will not disappear, that’s the truth.
Do taxis who steal foreign tourists still appear at the same places you show in the reports, namely at the Karl Bridge or at the Paris Street?
Yes, exactly so.
In these locations they stand every day and violate the regulations every day.
It is ignored by both the city police and the Prague magistrate.
It is no longer a cat, but an indifference.
Business of Prague taxi drivers in numbers
However, some of them, although they are just a part of the group, will get before the court.
It is already a breakthrough.
So I have to ask: Do you feel satisfied?
If I took it as a satisfaction, it would be wrong, because my goal was, is and will always be to make the center of Prague better.
And even if I feel it needs to be a bit better, I will continue to do it.
You need to press the door from the other side.
Even if there is the last thief there, we should still do something to remove it.
We cannot be satisfied with it.
But that is not the case, there are more of them.
Are you trying to get them in taxi?
Sometimes I do test rides and I have to say that it’s still bad.
Just last week I caught one taxi driver, by the way, from the same group, and was very surprised to see me again.
He charged 560 crowns for three kilometers, although he then claimed that it was a sum of 56 crowns (he used a trick with a decimal line).
He had a stick, the police arrived, and the taxi driver was so cute that he was still following the police and asked them when someone finally gave him the 56 crowns.
similar case.
A taxi driver on a taxi meter overlaped a decimal line and stole the tourists for 357 crowns.
Can it be said that the harshness of the fraudulent taxi drivers did not fall even after you showed in your images the faces of those who charged meaningless amounts for a short ride?
Their courage is still incredible.
What happened to the truck driver who claimed 56 crore?
The police sent him away with the fact that they could not discuss him on the site because he issued a quotation.
And that will, I think, be a problem with that court (six taxis and one ex-officer).
On the one hand there will be some taxi driver with their bills, on the other side the police.
However, according to a decision of the Supreme Administrative Court, the magistrate cannot use the secret recordings of a taxi service vehicle as evidence at the court.
When I filmed parts about their fraud, the taxi drivers themselves warned me of this precedent.
I’ve always wanted to use it to report.
Are you worried that this fact could protect you from the court?
I hope every judge will understand that no taxi driver could ride for six or ten crowns per kilometre, because he would not live with it.
You’ve talked about a trick with a decimal line, which is moving by underwater taxi drivers in front of foreign customers.
Is it still up-to-date, or are you worried that this fig after posting your reports will continue to use?
I think we have popularized this trick by broadcasting the program.
Recently I walked with one taxi driver, praising in front of me that he is the honest taxi driver.
Then I noticed a black card on the side of the taxi meter.
When I asked him what it had there, he said to me, “You know what it is.”
When taxis-frauders have not been charged with penalties too much, can the court and their colleagues have a warning impact on them?
Is there anything that can prevent them from fraud?
You have talked about the fact that you think they will always find the way to deceive.
I think nothing can stop them.
But someone can get them out of those places.
And these are fair taxi drivers who should be worried more for getting them away from there seriously.
From my experience I have to say that those fair taxi drivers in Prague fortunately prevail.
But do they want to go against those who ruin their reputation?
They have taste, but they lack mind.
They don’t know how to do so, and they don’t know exactly what they want.
When they organized the demonstration (for the proposal for a whole-loading restriction coming from the office of Mayor Adriana Krnáčová), it didn’t sound very clear what they really wanted.
Once they said they didn’t protest against Uber, they just wanted to have the same conditions as this service, then they said they wanted more than Uber.
It happened that they just blocked Prague and only created the best possible advertising for Uber.
How do you overall evaluate the approach of the Prague Magistrate to solve the problem with the pre-rental?
It seems that the criminal police had to go into it to resolve it.
The magistrate was short.
They had a bark that brought out the information, that is, the taxi department was doing their work for several years completely unnecessarily.
I hope that the officer will be charged up to the last check all the broken checks to realize what he has done.
I think that’s the worst thing to me.
I had even been with him on one check-out, which I found out only afterwards from their list.
A few months have passed since the release of the series.
What is the response?
I think mainly of foreign viewers, which is actually the most focused on the series.
Whenever I have friends from abroad, I send them the videos.
And when we then go through the Old Town Square, there’s a surprise that the same people that are seen on the images are seriously standing there.
The famous Prague celebrity.
But seriously.
I would put a plate around them so that people could look at them.
Museum of Communism on the street.
My last question is clear.
Do you drive a taxi when you need it?
of course.
I’m driving with services where I don’t need to pay in cash, but with a card.
I use services such as Uber or Liftago, where there is no possibility of fraud.
There are a lot of disciplines that are fair.
I took a taxi on the street only once.
The driver said to me, “But you have courage.”
We dress up for an Italian tourist.
The taxpayer’s fraud was in 2005.
The former mayor, Pavel Bém, went on a check drive in a cloth for an Italian tourist in the same year, and at the first attempt the driver scratched him for two hundred.
The reporter had a worse experience.
Drivers of the taxi service charged him for a ride from Old Town to Václavské náměstí 820 kronor, which is approximately 195 kronor per kilometer, as calculated by the creators of the reports.
The Prague Magistrate has set the maximum price to 28 crowns per kilometer.
In the filmed reports there are also other surprising amounts: for example, a two-kilometre road from the Paris Street to Truhlářské cost a tourist 400 crowns.
The taxi drivers were also waiting at the Karlovo most.
For the journey to the Angel, which has 2.5 kilometers, they will be charged for six hundred crowns.
The marble is washed mainly with clean water, as much as possible without chemistry and the longer, the better.
The impurities from it go well, although sometimes the dirt has to be given down by the scalpel, it is necessary to extract it from the hips.
It’s not easy and it doesn’t go quickly, the restorative Vanesa Trostova from Oldřichova in the Hague has approached her work.
The hat down before it: the tomb is built with a lease, after which it is necessary to rise countless times and rise again.
“The restaurant must be careful, patient and unnecessary to the work environment,” she said.
This is far from its first restoration work.
Thanks to it, rebuilds were expected, for example, the stone elements of the facade in the back track of the Frýdlant Municipality, restored also the statues of St. Mary Magdalena in Zátiší, St. John Nepomucký in Frýdlant, Pieta in Frýdlantské Okružní ulice, Mariánský stoup in Frýdlant and atlanty in the banks in the New Town under Smrk.
The restoration of Melchior, Christopher and Catherine's tomb in Redern began in Frýdlant in 2011.
Now the surface of the stone elements is cleansed from the nausea of impurities and crust, the released stone parts will be secure against fall and shift; either they will coat into the wall or to each other.
They are also treated and preserved.
The grapes on the tomb are repaid.
“Then it begins with the goldening of the inscriptions on marble plates with pure plat gold,” said Věra Sobotová, a spokesman for the State Monument Care of the City Office in Frýdlantu.
There is no record from the past that the tomb would have passed any repairs.
With a closer look, they will take the holes, wrapped in marble columns.
They are hundreds of years old and are remains after the decoration of the tomb.
It was richly decorated, unfortunately after the Swedish invasion during the Thirty-Year War everything disappeared.
The tomb was literally broken, Sabbath noted.
In the Church of Finding the Holy Cross are restaurants with a slight exaggeration as at home.
After the flood in 2010, it was necessary to arrange the tombs that were found under the water, the baptism was restored, the wall paintings in the tomb and now the tomb.
"We would also like to go into the vitraries in the future," Sobotova said.
The church is differently in very good condition, each year in maintenance and repairs we deposit money.
The restoration work on the rebuilding of the redernov cemetery will reach a total of 128 thousand crowns.
They will be paid out of grants, the city will not deposit any of its money in this part of restoration.
A hundred thousand crowns will go from the victory in the district round of the 2015 Historic City competition, the remaining 28 thousand crowns are the contribution of the Ministry of Culture, said Mayor Frýdlantu Dan Ramzer.
The decision was made for the restoration of the tomb.
Experts’ opinions on future developments on selected foreign markets followed through index and comparison with the Czech capital market (PX) within a month and a half year.
The markets are dominated by low volatility and growth.
Who would say that at the beginning of the year?
The U.S. S&P500 index, which passed 12% correction in February, is now at a new historical peak and has already reached 7% since the beginning of the year.
This is again confirmed by the iron rule that traders should never go against the interests of central banks, which ultimately have always reached their own.
In a situation where the U.S. shares are at the historic maximum, volatility is now the lowest since 2014, when the markets have grown satisfactory and fearlessly thanks to the quantitative release of the U.S. Central Bank and when the volatility index (VIX) remained stable below 12 percent.
And not too.
Though the Fed markets continue to prepare for a gradual rise in interest rates, the quantitative release in Europe and Japan is in full flow, and last week the Bank of England, which will buy bonds of £70 billion in the next six months, puts the hand to work.
The new wave of quantitative release thus pushes already so low revenues even lower and contributes to the almost complete elimination of risk and fear of the future.
How long will this state last?
This is a question for a million.
But there are no risks at the moment, the world economy is going through almost constant growth without greater fluctuations, the situation on the commodity market and in China is stabilizing and Brexit is no longer a topic, so we shouldn’t be too surprised if in a similar peaceful regime the U.S. shares continue to stand.
It's a shame that Juncker doesn't study Klaus!
I am very happy that my friend Michel Barnier has taken this important and challenging task.
I wanted an experienced politician for this difficult work, Juncker said, when the French politician (really experienced, because it has so many different multinational political functions that we would hardly find a better example of the so-called European elite) appointed the European Commission’s chief negotiator the conditions for the UK’s withdrawal from the EU.
Juncker’s choice has blurred signs of hope that it is in the serious interest of the EU to look for forms of future friendly coexistence with Britain.
However, most British media accepted the name Barnier as Juncker's war act.
Barnier is a rock European federalist.
They hate the UK.
As European Commissioner for the Internal Market (2009-2014) he was responsible for reforming European banking law.
He captured it as he alone could capture it: a strong enemy of the Anglo-Saxon concept of free market and the model of capitalism.
The advocate of multilateral regulations was the co-author of the concept of the so-called banking union and hated everything that comes from the London City Financial Center, promoted the legislation overwhelmed by the hard regulations of the financial sector and services.
So this Michel Barnier, the representative of Paris in the dispute with London, will be a hard, unbreaking, and apparently even a negligent negotiator.
This is probably not a good news.
How not to remember in this context the quiet and friendly division of the Czechoslovak Federation, to which so much contributed the balance, the overview and the ability of empathy of Prime Minister Václav Klaus.
And this is why today the Czechs and the Slovaks can be close friends and allies.
It is a shame that Juncker did not learn from Václav Klaus - at least in this.
It would be for the benefit of everyone!
The earthquake around Putin.
The Kremlin governor has released his close Ivanov.
Russian President Vladimir Putin has released Sergey Ivanov from office on Friday.
His place is taken by Anton Vajno.
This was by the Russian media with reference to the Kremlin press service.
Putin has said that Ivanov will be dismissed on his request.
At the meeting, which was broadcast by the television station Rossija 24, the president said that he came out to meet Ivan's wishes expressed when he took office that he wants to be the head of the presidential office for a maximum of four years.
He also announced that Ivanov will be his special representative for ecology and transport.
The report on the exchange in the head of the presidential administration, which will now be led by Ivanov's previous representative Vajno, is considered quite surprising.
Ivanov, who is 63 years old, is named one of Putin’s closest collaborators.
This former KGB officer in the past, for example, served as the Minister of Defense and Deputy Prime Minister.
He is also a member of the Security Council.
But Ivanov said during his meeting with Putin that the length of staying in the head of the state administration is actually a recordman.
He lived there for four years and eight months.
In this context, he recalled that in 25 years since its establishment, 11 people have already been replaced in this position.
None of the boys and boys won’t play the final.
So far, no one of the Friday tennis matches has managed to turn into a final participation.
Petra Kvitová was the first to lose her struggle, which succeeded in the portorican surprise of Monica Puig after the seats 4:4, 6:1 and 3:6.
A short time later, the Czech deblisters Safarivá with Uncle followed Kvitovou.
The winners of the Williams sisters, though in the first set, came to win, but lost two setballs and the Russians eventually gained the set in a short game.
The second set was lost by the ratio of 4:6.
Half success in the morning program in Rio was recorded by the Czech vessel: skier Ondřej Synek with overview won his semi-finals, when the second Damir Martin from Croatia was defeated despite the release in the final almost a second.
The weather was great, the wind calmed.
I tried to save as much as possible, said the son.
His opponents, unlike him, had to fight for the progress.
So it took some strength, and tomorrow it could be easier.
But I don't say that it's going to be easy, it's just playing me in the cards, said the Praga Dukla spacecraft.
Mirka Topinková-Knapková didn’t walk in the Dreams.
The thirty-five-year-old has occupied the fourth position in the semi-finals today in her race and on Saturday she is waiting for the start in the B final and the fight for the 7th to 12th place.
London’s gold doesn’t go so much.
This was the first time I did not go to the final at the Olympics.
I'm a little sorry, but on the other hand I went a good race and put everything I could.
The competitors were just better, the Topinkova Knapková slept before them.
She fought until the end and believed she would get in her fourth games among the elite six.
He gave up just before the goal.
I knew that the girls are balanced, that from that field anyone can go forward.
I was surprised by the Chinese that she had such a finish.
And I thought I could go to the final through Austria.
Unfortunately, today was a life race, said the 2011 world champion.
Far behind the final gates in Rio remained the young shooter Filip Nepejchal, who was not able to break out of the qualification for the second time, this time malorage in bed.
He won the 33th place.
The qualifications were best for the Russians.
Sergey Kamensky took 629 points and Kirill Grigorjan (628,9).
Nepechal's shot was 620,5 points.
Athletes also spoke to the Rio program for the first time, including the Czech seven-boys Kateřina Cachová and Eliška Klučinová.
Cachs are the 11th place after the second discipline of the Olympic competition, and the Czech recordman Eliška Klučinová is twenty-two.
It is led by British Katarina Johnson-Thompson, who jumped to a height of 198 centimeters as well as the second Belgian Nafissata Thiam.
Both have achieved historically the best high-end performance in the seven-boys.
They tried to jump 201 centimeters yet they failed.
The German, the Russian, who is worse?
When we take a look away from the absurdity of this question: the German society has passed through a deep self-reflection, while the Russian does not.
In the two great Eurasian nations in the 20th century there were dictators, and regimes that were unhuman, brutal and terrible came to power.
From 1917 to 1989, the Russian Bolsheviks contributed greatly to the 94 million victims of communism listed in the Black Book of Communism, whether it were daily individual repression, targeted hunger, incompetent war leadership or unhuman experiments.
The Nazis unhumanly destroyed about 6 million Jews and the total victims of the Second World War is estimated to be 60 million.
In the occupied or abandoned territories, the Germans and the Soviets committed brutality.
Neither in Germany nor in the USSR, only a few individuals were guilty, but a large portion of the nation participated in these crimes either actively, passively, or just by cowardly or by throwing their heads into the sand.
This is not the specificity of these nations, we Czechs are equally guilty.
In Germany, the immediate end of the war came the denatification, the Nuremberg Tribunal.
But the most important thing came later.
When the children grew up, they began to ask: Daddy, grandfather, why did you take part in such brutality?
How you could!
This brought real reflection and healing of society.
Until recently, the German elites were mainly concerned about the country’s prosperity, the elimination of poverty, the well-being of its citizens.
Now they have other (often naively idealist) goals, but they definitely don’t want to connect back to Alsace-Lothrine or to attack someone – for revenge – militarily – that’s probably everyone will recognize.
After the Cold War in Russia there was no big reflection.
The window of possible positive changes was definitely closed at the millennium’s breakthrough when former KGB officer Vladimir Putin came to power.
The criminal past is often celebrated today in Russia.
Putin’s policy of Russia is revenge, conquest of lost territories, humiliation of the West.
Health, prosperity and the future of their own people are no value for the wreath.
Be yours, and strangers will be afraid.
I still believe that it is just the decades of the despotic regime that the Russians are not genetically or culturally inferior – predestined to Asian (self) tyrannia.
Who is concerned about the growth of tensions around Crimea?
the Ukrainian army.
In recent days and hours, the situation on the Ukrainian-Russian border in the Crimea region has worsened.
Who has the growth of tension?
After a long period of relatively peace, the relations between Ukraine and Russia have again deteriorated.
The argument of the Ukrainian party became the Crimea Peninsula, which was connected to Russia more than 2 years ago and is part of its territory.
News from both enemy sides, of course, contradict and it is difficult to independently verify them, so we have the opportunity to just think about the old known question to whom it benefits?
According to reports from Moscow, there have been terrorist attacks on Crimea from the Ukrainian side, which of course Ukraine denies and vice versa accuses the Kremlin of provocation.
To the information about the arrest of Ukrainian special forces on the territory of Russia came already from the case of the pilot Savchenko known response that they were allegedly kidnapped on the territory of Russia.
If we approach the Ukrainian version, what would Russia benefit from worsening the situation around Crimea?
The simple answer is: in nothing.
The escalation of tensions around the Crimea can only harm Russia, mainly by the West in the form of further strengthening sanctions and strengthening the anti-Russian campaign.
In the past year, in the background of the immigration crisis to Europe, there has been a retreat of attention from the situation in Ukraine.
The Ukrainian leadership has already completely lost credit before its inhabitants, with the current support of President Poroshenko moving around 15%.
The economy of Ukraine would have long been bankrupt without generous financial injections from the EU and mainly the IMF.
In this situation, the Ukrainian regime needs again to strongly draw attention to its country in order to justify its further requests for financial assistance and to try to improve its reputation before voters in its country.
President Poroshenko and other members of the leadership of the forces again want to show themselves as strong men who are not afraid to stand up even with the great Russia.
It remains to hope that all those who try to trigger an open conflict between Ukraine and Russia will finally realize their enormous responsibility for the lives of not only soldiers, but all ordinary people on both enemy sides and stop their enemy actions in time.
Bulgaria reports inflation for the first time in eight months
According to national statistics, the monthly inflation rate in Bulgaria reached 1% in July.
This is the highest rate in several years (from June 2012) and the first non-null rate since October of last year, when a positive inflation rate of 0.2% was published.
The average annual inflation rate, measured by the CPI, for the last 12 months (August 2015 - July 2016) compared to the previous 12 months (August 2014 - July 2015) was -0,8%.
The index of consumer prices in July 2016 compared to June 2016 was 101,0%, the monthly inflation therefore was 1,0%.
The inflation rate since the beginning of the year (July 2016 compared to December 2015) was -0,2%, and the annual inflation rate in July 2016 compared to July 2015 was -0,2%.
Compared to the previous month, in July 2016, the number of consumer goods: food and non-alcoholic beverages (1.7%), transport (1.8%), culture and recreation (6.3%), restaurants and hotels (1.2%), other goods and services (0.3%) has increased.
The price decline occurred in clothing and shoes (2,2 %), furniture, household equipment and regular maintenance (0,5 %), health (0,1 %).
At the same level as the previous month, prices for alcoholic beverages and tobacco products, housing, water, electricity, gas and other fuels, communication and education remained.
U.S. secret services have been monitoring Russian hacking attacks for a year.
Information about the Russian attacks came to the public last month when the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) announced that it was engaged in an attack on the servers of the Democratic party's headquarters.
There is no official report on Russia’s participation in the attack.
Moscow denied the participation in the attack.
The report on the follow-up of the alleged Russian attack was strictly secret because its disclosure would reveal that the U.S. intelligence services are monitoring the hacking attack, and it could also be revealed how they do it and what resources they use.
Two Russian intelligence agencies were involved in the attack.
New Cybersecurity Advisory Board
The material on the tracking of the Russian track was encoded and only a small group of experts had access to it, Reuters wrote.
Of the public officials, only a small group of eight chief members of Congress, called the U.S. gang of eight, was informed.
It is composed of the heads of both chambers Mitch McConnell and Paul Ryan, the presidents of the Democrats in both chambers Nancy Pelosi and Harry Reid and four members of the Congress’s Defence and Security Committee.
Democratic Party chief Donna Brazile on Thursday announced that she is creating a cybersecurity advisory body to “prevent future attacks and ensure first-class protection of the Democratic Party servers.”
There was a dangerous parasite in the slurry of Alberta.
The chain apologized.
Based on the incentive of the consumer to health problems after consumption of food Losos wild uzený - pieces of 100 g, the date of consumption 22.11.2016 the Prague hygienics conducted a check in the stores Albert on the Vaclav Square and Na Můstku.
The inspection found that the L23012562/T4 package with the date of consumption 22.11.2016, to which the customer noted, was no longer available, and therefore the product of the same package with the date of consumption 11.12.2016 was removed.
A laboratory examination confirmed the presence of Anisakis spp. Anisakis simplex.
It is a parasitic worm of the digestive tract of seafood mammals.
This is dangerous for a person - the larves in the body cavity or muscle of the fish are a strong allergen and the living larves dried by a person can penetrate through the stomach wall into the internal organs.
We apologize to our customers for the problems with this brand product.
We immediately removed the aforementioned series from the sale and for preventive reasons we also removed all the other series of this item.
The mistake occurred on the side of the supplier we deal with, and at the same time we left this product to be tested, Albert Barbora Vanko, a spokesman, told News.
If the customer purchased this product, he can return it in any of the chain stores and get the money back.
Larves destroy frozen and sufficient thermal treatment
The seller was the company Nekton - Vrňata.
About the occurrence of the hazardous product, the hygienics informed the Prague and Central Czech Veterinary Administration.
According to the server, people can get sick with anisakiosis, which will manifest severe abdominal pain, vomiting and nausea, or the disease can go without symptoms.
The symptoms occur an hour to two weeks after eating insufficiently thermally processed infected fish.
After three weeks from the beginning of the disease, the larva usually spontaneously leaves the digestive tract.
Adult worms and larves are sensitive to higher and low temperatures, therefore they are killed either by sufficient thermal processing of fish meat, or when it is frozen.
Veterinarians have currently checked the salmon in the recipient of the imported goods in the Central Czech Republic.
Three of the five samples examined had a parasite in themselves.
The shipment of 1,700 products arrived in the Czech Republic according to the State Veterinary Administration (SVS) in early April.
Vyexpeded, in the absolute majority to the Ahold chain, was to this day 919 packages.
Currently, the unselled stock of the product is being downloaded from the stores, SVS spokesman Petr Pejchal said on Friday.
Veterinarians immediately after finding positive samples banned sending additional products from the warehouse.
A 17-year-old British woman wanted to escape from Rakka, killed by a Russian bombing.
After the initial enthusiasm and fast marriage with a jihadist who was soon killed, a disgrace came.
The expected paradise of the chalifate transformed for British girls into a hell on the earth from which there was no escape.
The girl, according to relatives, was in contact with her sister Halima.
She has repeatedly called her to Britain and told her she wants to return home.
Leaving the Islamic State is like trying to escape from Alcatraz.
They have an order to shoot without thought, the Telegraph quotes the lawyer of the family of the deceased girl Tasnim Akunjee.
The last traces led to the Rakka, and from there the girl heard the last time.
There was only a report of her death, which cannot be confirmed.
The family communicated with her from an apartment in East London.
Together they discussed how they could get out of Rakka and cross the Turkish border.
They were hoping to meet the former student again.
But Kadiza was probably killed before she was able to escape because the house in which she stayed compared in May with the country of attacks, the British ITV News.
The television added that the bomb was apparently shot down by a Russian aircraft that attacked the IS basement in Syria.
You'd bear the blue from heaven just to get your child from the dangerous area, said Tasnim Akunjee, a family lawyer.
In the week when (Kadiza) thought of escaping from the territory of the Islamic State, one Austrian woman was captured in an attempt to escape and, according to available information, was publicly killed to death.
I think (Kadiza) explained it as a warning and decided not to risk, according to BBC Akunjee.
The family would do anything.
Kadiza Sutlana and her 15-year-old school friend Shamima Begum and Amir Abas went on a trip on February 17th last year.
At home they just said they went out.
But they targeted Gatwick Airport and from it through Turkey on the territory controlled by ISIS.
The girl's family, according to the lawyer, did everything she could to get Kadiza back.
You’d bear the blue from heaven, just to get your child out of the dangerous area and this family has done everything she can, drinking all the strengths to get her daughter home.
But it was not possible without the risk of being captured by themselves, the lawyer added.
The only positive is that the fate of Kadiza can serve as a frightening case for other girls or boys who let themselves be fooled by Islamist propaganda.
“There are many cases where people have gone there, realized how things are there, understood how far it differs from the promises of the propaganda of the Islamic State, and they wanted to return,” said Akunjee.
The fate of the cousins is unknown.
But as they have also been silent, their families have to agree that they are most likely dead.
to prison for money.
In Scotland you can go to prison even without committing a crime.
For many centuries, the municipality of Inveraray was the district center and the headquarters of the Duke of Argyll.
Since the middle of the 18th century, courts have been held in the municipality and the underground under the hall served as a local prison.
The conditions in which the prisoners lived were sad and many prisoners tried to escape.
Many of them successfully.
Therefore, the city officials decided to move the prison spaces to a new place.
The new building was completed in 1848 and was much more friendly to prisoners, had heating and gas lighting.
In any case, it was not in operation for a long time, it was closed for economic reasons already at the end of August 1889, as the smaller repair facilities were expensive to operate and not paid too much.
Stories of prisoners and the hunt of ghosts.
For the public, prisons opened a whole century later, visitors can compare the old building with the new to convince themselves how different conditions in them ruled.
The guides in time costumes further strengthen the authentic experience.
There is also a torture room in which visitors can learn what forms of punishment were applied to the criminal, whether it was breaking the fingers or burning signs on the body.
As part of the tour, tourists can be allowed to be locked in one of the customs, mostly because of a photo on a memorial, or to get the feeling that prisoners experience behind the prisons.
Inveraray Prison is one of the most famous places in Scotland, where it is allegedly scary.
There have already been several groups of paranormal activities hunters and until today the museum allows people to come some ghosts to hunt.
However, this night will be 300 pounds, which is approximately 9,500 kronor.
The town, in addition to this popular tourist attraction, also attracts great food, surrounding panoramas and history.
“Animate” effect on Snapchat is criticized as an Asian cartoon
According to Snapchat, this filter is inspired by animate, but some observers say it is racist.
Snapchat every day allows about 150 million users to change reality and play with identity in ways that bound to absurdity.
You can make yourself ananas, a dog or a character that seems to come out of the image of Roye Lichtenstein.
Filters are simple tools that deform reality and generate more than 30 million improved selfie images every day.
Any errors will be announced immediately.
Snapchat filters have in the past been criticized by accusations that the app promotes blackfacing or that it supports white shades of the skin as the ideal of beauty.
So when this week it offered users a filter that gave them shy eyes, curved teeth, and swollen faces, some critics called it a racist cartoon of the Asian – “yellowface.”
And they asked whether these repeated controversial questions do not indicate a greater problem of society - the problem of diversity.
On Wednesday, Verge and Motherboard wrote about it, and the news and anger rapidly spread, and Snapchat said on the next day that it cancelled the feature.
The company offered an explanation: The filter was intended as an account manifest to the characters of the animated, not as a cartoon of the Asian.
But to the observers who witnessed racism, the filter reminded the painful stereotypes in action.
Others without the package comparison with the animé refused.
Grace Sparapani, a Korean American art student whose tweet about photos was widely shared, said in an email that the filter was “at least harmful and shy.”
She added, “It’s hard to argue against comparing the obvious Asian cartoon and the filter effects.
It turns out that the filter is not only about the yellow face (yellowface), but that the yellow face is quoted to the neglected extreme.
Snapchat is not the only company that has crossed these cultural limits.
The American culture seems to have an endless struggle for diversity and inclusion, from corporate meeting halls to Hollywood and the facilities we all carry in hand.
And a huge number of young people on Snapchat – who are more racially diversified than their older partners – can mean that even greater sensitivity can be expected.
“When one Snapchat filter creates an image that is insulting to any user,” said twenty-five-year-old Katie Zhuová on Thursday in an interview, “there’s hard to get these things out today without notice, as it was before.”
Katie Zhu, a product manager and designer working for Medium, decided on Thursday to delete her Snapchat account and urged others to do the same.
In an article for Medium and a telephone interview, she said she is convinced that racial-motivated problems reflect a lack of diversity in Snapchat employment.
Katie Zhu has criticized the prevailing white, completely male leadership of the company and the article ended with a hash tag: #DeleteSnapchat.
“It’s either that they don’t have any diversity and colorful people among employees at the time when these things are decided,” said Zhu, who has Chinese-American origin, “or there colorful people work, but not on positions to feel safe or pleasant to speak.”
Other observers share her opinion - a complaint that Snapchat left largely without answer.
The Company does not publish numbers relating to the diversity of its employees with the fact that it has the status of a private company.
On Thursday, Snapchat refused to talk about the racial origin of its employees, but according to a spokesman, the company recently recruited a recruitment worker to focus on the poorly represented population and on internal management of inclusion.
Zhuová adds: “I’m wondering if they really need other such users who can say that it’s not right,” with the fact that their account remains cancelled.
Military officers have distorted information about ISIS, says parliamentary committee
The parliamentary committee said in a report on Thursday that officials from the U.S. Central Command changed the intelligence service reports to draw a more optimistic picture of the war against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria than the events from the country provided.
According to the preliminary report of the working group composed by the Republican chairman of the Committee on the Armed Forces, the Committee on Intelligence Services and the Subcommittee for Defense, a “large dissatisfaction” was found among analysts of the Central Intelligence Service, according to which their superiors changed their assessment of U.S. efforts to defeat the Islamic State.
The Central Command, known as CentCom, is the military headquarters in Tampa, Florida, which oversee U.S. military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
In a press release to the report, it is stated: “The outcomes of intelligence services approved by senior Centcom officials typically offered a more positive picture of U.S. anti-terrorist efforts than confirmed by the facts on the ground, and were consistently more positive than the analyses obtained from other parts of the intelligence community.”
"What has happened in Centcom is unacceptable - our fighters are damaged when the top policy makers are submitted a misanalysis," said Ken Calvert, Congressman and Republican from California.
The failure in the leadership of Centcom reaches the top of the organization.
The ten-page report describes in detail the continuing problems of the Central Staff in describing and analyzing U.S. efforts to train Iraqi forces in 2014 and 2015.
Although there is no decisive evidence that the top officials of the Obama administration have ordered the reports to be amended, the report states that analysts had the impression that they were under pressure by the leaders of Centcom to present a more optimistic view of the danger presented by the Islamic State, i.e. IS.
“In the first half of 2015, many press reports of the Central Staff, statements and disclaims from Congress were significantly more positive than what the events actually were,” the report said.
For example, a representative of the Centcom publicly stated that a major military attack to occupy Mosul could begin in April or May 2015.
Mosul, the second largest city in Iraq, remains under the control of the Islamic State.
“This is quite clear after months of investigation,” Kansas Republican Party representative Mike Pompeo said in a statement.
From the middle of 2014 to the middle of 2015, the highest-ranking U.S. headquarters intelligence personnel manipulated the outcomes of the headquarters intelligence services in order to minimize the danger of ISIS in Iraq.
The Republicans formed a working group after they learned about the analyst concerns that the intelligence services relating to the Islamic State are being manipulated.
After the report published on Thursday, further investigation must be followed by a more detailed investigation.
A further investigation is being conducted by the General Inspector of the Ministry of Defense.
The Democratic members of the Committee on Intelligence Services published their own findings on Thursday, which corresponded to some of the findings of the Republican Working Group.
“Between 2014 and 2015, Centcom created a very narrow process to compile the evaluation of information about ISIS and Iraqi security forces,” said representative Adam B. Schiff, Chairman of the Committee and representative of the Democrats in a statement.
According to the words of Adam Schiff, this process “drawed the outcomes of intelligence services,” damaged the morality among analysts and “not sufficiently taken into account the disagreements.”
However, Schiff and the Democrats claim that they did not find any evidence that the White House would try to push Centcom analysts to adjust their conclusions according to “a proposal or a political situation.”
The preliminary results of the parliamentary investigation were published on Tuesday in the Daily Beast.
Last August, the New York Times the ongoing investigation of the Pentagon General Inspector, which was launched after the complaints of Centcom analysts.
Commander Colonel Patrick Evans, a spokesman for the Pentagon, said in a statement that the Ministry of Defense will not comment on the parliamentary report as the general inspector’s investigation is still ongoing.
But he said that “experts sometimes disagree on the interpretation of comprehensive data, and that the intelligence community and the Ministry of Defense welcome a healthy dialogue on these key issues of national security.”
The investigation has effects beyond the question of whether the U.S.-led bombing in Iraq and Syria is successful (a statement that is now declared by an increasing number of defense officials).
However, last year’s accusations raised questions about the extent to which President Obama can rely on the fact that the Central Staff is honestly evaluating military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis areas.
The news criticism of the Islamic State reflects the conflicts for more than a decade when Centcom’s intelligence service analyst Gregory Hooker wrote a research paper in which it stated that the administration of President George W. Bush – despite the objections of many analysts – defended a small unit in Iraq and spent little time thinking about what will follow the 2003 invasion.
Hooker also played a key role in resisting Islamic State intelligence services.
Last year the authorities announced that Hooker's team came to the conclusion that despite the public statements of the opposite, air strikes against Islamic State refineries did not significantly dissolve the financial resources of the terrorist group because the group built temporary refineries and sold oil on the black market.
The Times in September that the findings were not transmitted outside the headquarters.
The Commander of the Centcom, General Lloyd J. Austin III, was then criticized last year after many lawmakers found the witness of the Senate too positive ratings of war.
General Austin resigned in April and was replaced by General Joseph L. Votel at Centcom.
The U.S. won land hockey in the fourth match in a row, so today the decisive match will be played in the UK team
Katie Bam in the match against Japan, which ended with a win 6:1, scored three goals and just a day later for the American women's land hockey team scored the first two goals of the match, in which on Thursday America defeated India 3:0.
Five goals in two matches are a success worth remembering, but Bam (27) said she was not sure if she had ever succeeded.
“I don’t know,” she said.
I am not one of those who write their goals.
But this knows: Americans on the Olympic tournament lead to 4-0 matches and share their first place in the group with Britain, which remained on Thursday after Japan's 2-0 defeat remains unbeaten.
The United Kingdom and the United States will meet on Saturday in the last match of the first round.
Both teams qualify to the quarterfinals and the match decides who in the group of six teams will end in the first and who in the second place.
The team of the first place will take a little longer away from the strong Danish, who are in the head of the second group.
Whatever the Saturday match ends anyway, the Americans here with their surprising race triggered trouble, four years after they ended between 12 teams at the London Games.
In that team there was Bam.
She grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, and took land hockey for the first time in her hands when she was 3 years old (her older sisters twins played in Drexel) and joined the national team when she was 16 and became his youngest player at all.
The 2008 Olympics took place because she did not get to the final list.
Then came the 2012 year, when neither her nor her team members had a lot of success.
The next year the coach was named English Craig Parnham and things began to change.
“Cultural change, mental change, physical change,” Bam said.
In London, we didn’t have the work rate we have today.
We made a complete turn.
On Thursday night, Bam started in the first half by shooting the goal by a bekend from the vicinity.
India entered the match without a win in the tournament, but the team turned out to be surprisingly hard and kept the score 1-0 until the end of the third quarter, when Bam took advantage of the opportunities.
She escaped on the left side of the playground, then climbed to the center and shot the ball into the goal to get the Americans to lead 2-0.
Melissa Gonzalez added the last goal in half the fourth quarter.
The departure of the American goalkeeper, Jackie Briggs, who in each of the three victories helped one goal, was the first at the tournament.
It is in excellent form.
Just like Bam.
"We are now in a good place," Parnham said, but how good it is, it will depend on the result of the Saturday match.
Zen trampolines in the middle of the Olympics
It doesn’t matter where you are, it doesn’t matter how many hours it is – it’s an Olympics.
From the events in Rio de Janeiro it is to feel a persistent, undescribed and busy shift of competitiveness and effort.
It’s like the Olympic walk itself would be a fierce stafet colique, which is transferred from the shooter to the swimmers, the gymnast and the triathlonist.
You can’t turn on the TV, read the newspapers, or listen to your neighbor’s conversation on the front of the cafe without hearing about Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky, or the discouragement between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.
It is also Logan Dooley.
Dooley, the upcoming girlfriend of women with faces, is on the Olympics for the first time and could also be among those whose names will sound in the households in the main broadcast time between the advertising and spots of sponsors, if he would be a swimmer, a gymnast or even a shermer.
But Dooley (28) from Lake Forest in California fights for Olympic gold in trampoline jumping.
The Olympic fire does not shine on all competitions the same way.
Far from the center, a little in the shadow are sports that are not generally recognized: air pistol shooting, shooting, badminton, taekvondo.
We will always have success in the classic swimming style - and will probably rule for a long time.
But if I can name my extraordinary favourite, let me point out the invisible magic of the trampoline.
Although jumping on the trampoline is an Olympic sport since 2000, when it was first launched at the Sydney Games, after 16 years of intervention, this sport remains almost unnoticed - many people I have been questioned, even didn't know it's an Olympic sport.
It can be regional indifference.
The U.S. has never won a medal in the trampoline jump and until 2012 no athlete has reached the final.
Prices in the male category are usually divided between China and Russia and in the female category between China and Canada.
This year the gold medals will be won by Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennan from Canada.
But jumping on the trampoline has another misfortune, partly because the ear of the unconscious will rather seem to be more suitable for the clown university than for the Olympics.
I have to admit that I am not an expert, but only an enthusiast watching from the country.
It has a comic potential - the comic vibrations of infinite reflection - but also the laidness of gymnastics and immersion, two sports that it combines in itself.
The word “trampoline” is derived from the Spanish “el trampoline” which means “the jumping plate.”
The aspiring champions jump on an enormous trampoline, which will shoot them up to a height of 10 meters and show compilations with several elements (salt, wheels and combinations) before they finally land again on their feet.
According to the official Olympic program, they are evaluated by performance, difficulty and “time in the air”.
There will be 23 athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women.
The usual trajectory of the Olympic Trail is in advance.
Fighters for the gold medal must go further, faster and even higher, sometimes to the end, sometimes there and back, up and down.
They are trying to pursue not only the target tape or the starting wall, but, as television news reports, also another imaginary line: the world record or the Olympic record.
This unanimous effort is noble, admirable, a bit fanatic - and sufficient to bring the audience to tears.
But I think it’s a bit exhausting when you watch the Olympics.
Jumping on the trampoline in this regard brings relief.
The trail of the athlete on the trampoline is upward.
It does not mean moving forward.
He or she reflects as if they were in a state of weightless as astronauts, flying up, then down, and then again without effort up.
Without competition and of course even difficulty, it cannot be done, but for the duration of the composition, there is no angry struggle for the goal, no distance measurement, but only the perfect, gentle flexion of time and gravity.
This is just the closest time when the Olympics and Zen are approaching.
Women’s Qualifications and Finals are held on Friday afternoon, at 13 a.m. Eastern time, and men’s competitions on Saturday at the same time.
The NBC station will broadcast the final in the afternoon block, which starts after both days at 14 p.m.
In the middle of the Olympic madness they promise quiet, pleasant moments that you will probably overlook through the other matches.
And if the attention has to be reached only by the fact that male athletes will be the subject of loving views and materialization - as according to the Wall Street Journal recently proposed by U.S. gymnastes - then Logan Dooley only awaits his new fans, who are leaping after breath.
“Protesting Generations” in Ethiopia, a long-standing U.S. ally
Violent protests in Ethiopia
Demonstrators calling for political change in Ethiopia have encountered the government’s violent resistance.
Witnesses claim that many protesters were shot dead during the strikes with the police.
Is there a war in Ethiopia?
In the last decade it was one of the most stable nations in Africa, a solid Western alliance with a rapidly growing economy.
Over the past few months, however, the country has been captured by anti-government rebellions, which are spreading to more and more areas.
Only in the last week, thousands of people have gone out to the streets calling for substantial political changes.
According to organizations fighting for human rights, the government’s reaction was immaculate.
Witnesses claim that the police shot and killed a crowd of unarmed protesters.
On the rolling videos of the protests that are probably coming from the end of last year or the beginning of this year, security forces are captured as they beat young people with holes after they were forced to stand at the wall on their hands.
The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights is now calling for a thorough investigation.
“It has always been difficult to keep this country together and making a step forward will be even harder,” said Rashid Abdi, Head of the Horn of Africa project for the International Crisis Group.
Ethiopia is the second most populated nation in Africa after Nigeria and its stability is supported by the West.
The U.S. military and intelligence services are working closely with the Etiopans to eliminate the danger of a terrorist attack in the area, especially in Somalia, and few of the African countries, if any, get such assistance from the West.
The economy of Ethiopia was developing at an impressive pace.
Its infrastructure has been significantly improved – even a new suburb train runs in the capital Addis Ababa.
And the streets of the city are typically quiet, safe and clean.
However, Ethiopia is hard to describe as a model of democracy – organizations fighting for human rights constantly talk about government repressions – opposition in the country was suppressed, dissidents effectively silenced.
Many of them were expelled, imprisoned, murdered or expelled far into the desert.
However, this can change.
“When you shoot people and they don’t have any other option than to protest, there’s a breakthrough,” said Seyoum Teshome, a lecturer at the University in Central Ethiopia.
Every youth is protesting.
A whole generation protests.
There are many complaints and they deal with everything from land disputes to the absolute control of the power of the ruling coalition.
After last year’s elections, which were widely criticized, the ruling party and its allies gained the last seat held by the opposition and now controls 100 percent in parliament.
At the same time, the pressure on the border with Eritrea is rising. the conflict along this inaccurately marked, controversial border has caused hundreds of lives in June.
Anylitians are concerned that separatist groups that have been more or less suppressed over the past years, such as the Oromic Liberation Front or the Ogaden National Liberation Front, may try to take advantage of confusion and rearm themselves.
There are several factors that explain why now, after years of smoking under the surface, these ugly feelings have burned up again.
The first of them is apparently harmless: smart phones.
Many Etiopans can communicate through social networks until the last few years, when cheaper smartphones have become commonly available and the provision of internet services has improved.
And even though the government prohibits access to Facebook or Twitter, as it is commonly happening especially during protests, many people can still communicate through internet proxy that hide the location of these people.
A few young Etiopans talked about how they gathered for the protests.
Moreover, there is greater solidarity between Oromas and Amharas, the two largest ethnic groups in Ethiopia.
Orom and Amhar are not natural allies.
For long ages, the Amhars, mostly from the Christian mountains of Ethiopia, have emerged in politics and trade and have used the Oromas, many of which are Muslims and live in the lowlands.
But that also changes.
“We are on the way to a united leadership,” said Mulatu Gemechu, the leader of the Oromos.
The major protests occurred in the areas of Amhara and Oromy.
Many Amhars and Oroms believe that Ethiopia is wrongly dominated by the Tigers, which make up about 6 percent of the population and controls the army, intelligence, trade and politics.
The third reason for the unrest is the death of Melese Zenawi.
Zenawi, the former leader of the rebels, was the Prime Minister of Ethiopia for 17 years until his death in 2012, when he suffered from unknown illness.
He was considered a tactical genius, a man who was able to see the corner.
Analysts say that he masterfully managed to reveal the initial signs of dissatisfaction and used the ambassadors to process and get the opponents on his side.
“The current regime lacks basic knowledge,” said Abdi, an analyst of the conflict.
The new Prime Minister of Ethiopia, Hailemariam Desalegn, was pulled out of relative ignorance in order to replace Zenawi.
Unlike Zenawi, who originated from the Tiger region of northern Ethiopia, Hailemariam comes from the south.
Analysts say they do not trust the security services controlled by the Tigre.
Many are concerned that the result will be further blood flow.
The last time Ethiopia experienced such unrest was in 2005 after thousands of people protested against what analysts described as elections that the government scammed and then stolen.
It followed a harsh intervention, during which many protesters were killed – although less than in the past months – and this period of turmoil passed relatively quickly.
Development experts appreciated the leaders of Ethiopia for the visionary infrastructure planning, such as the new suburban train and measurable progress in the fight against poverty.
However, it is clear that the gradual rise of disputes within the Ethiopian government did not stop it.
And there is a dangerous ethnic formation.
Last month, protesters in the Amhar city of Gondar attacked the business companies owned by the Tigers and the hatred against the Tigers on social networks is becoming more and more common.
Analysts say the protests put into the unpleasant situation of the United States and other Western allies.
The U.S. government is using Ethiopia as a base for drones over neighboring Somalia, although it has recently stated that the base was closed.
While the West clearly wants to support democracy, it does not want its ally to break down in an unstable region.
“This,” Abdi said, “is a very sharp border of sharp.”
Donald Trump explains his statement about Obama and the financing of ISIS as “sarcasm”
Donald J. Trump on Friday tried to bagatelize the latest controversy that flooded his campaign, stating that he did not think seriously when several times this week he insisted that President Obama and Hillary Clinton were the “founder” of the terrorist group Islamic State.
The explanation raised new questions about the Republican presidential candidate’s ability to speak clearly with the U.S. public.
He also puts his supporters into an unpleasant situation, who hardly defended him in a stormy time and must explain that his notes may not be thought seriously.
After this proposal at the meeting on Wednesday night, Trump confirmed the statement on Thursday and insisted in the talks that he did not really intend to say that President and H. Clinton created the IS.
However, in a tweet on Friday morning, Trump said he was just sarcastic.
The post was the opposite of the old claim only one day when Trump said in several talks that his accusations, on the contrary, he thought seriously.
When the conservative radio moderator Hugh Hewitt tried to help Trump relieve the note by reminding that Obama is trying to destroy ISIS, the Republican candidate for the president did not respond.
The latest storm comes in the moment when Trump tried to focus his campaign’s attention on the economy, while his preferences in pre-election surveys are falling.
Trump and Clinton took part in the Michigan duel on economic issues this week.
On Friday, Trump attempted to return to the issue.
On Twitter, he warned again that Clinton’s proposals are associated with tax increases, and said that according to Nick, her speech was boring.
Trump used the defense of sarcasm earlier.
At the end of July, when he gathered a wave of criticism when he spoke with the proposal that the Russians should penetrate Clinton’s emails, his note later explained with the words: “I’m, of course, sarcastic.”
This approach allows Trump to push the boundaries of political statements and mitigate them as needed.
“I think it’s his way of testing, to what extent some reports have a response to his supporters to find out how they react, and according to the reaction then in one way or another “shaped the explanation,” said Ruth Sherman, a communication specialist who followed the language that both candidates used.
But I also think he is skilled in his statements and knows that they are unclean enough to explain them differently.
Because the results of the pre-election surveys continue to decline in his favour, Trump has chosen in recent days even more upset tone, instead of mitigating things for general voters.
A new NBC/Wall Street Journal/Marist survey, which was published on Friday, showed that Tump is far behind Clinton in North Carolina, Virginia and Colorado and very close behind her in Florida.
Trump is trying to avoid apologies for the provocative statements he says, but often accuses his criticism of misinterpretation of his words or misunderstanding of his sense of humor.
But along with how Trump faces increased attention in the last months of the presidential campaign, Trump’s jokes have led to the unpleasant situation of his dedicated supporters, who have to stand behind him publicly, no matter how provocative his comments are.
Rudolph W. Giuliani, a former New York City mayor, who is one of Trump’s most prominent supporters, had to defend the candidate on Thursday in an interview with CNN.
“I think what he says is a legitimate political comment,” Giuliani said when asked about Trump’s claim that Obama and Clinton founded the Islamic State.
This is true in the sense that before Obama, the Islamic State was almost unknown, a small organization that he completely mistakenly called a novice.
The majority of ordinary Republicans are trying to argue that the Obama government, in which Clinton served as a foreign minister, allowed the Islamic State to flourish and failed to handle the situation in the Middle East aggressively.
Before Friday’s meetings in Pennsylvania, Trump continued to throw a fire on the media around him on Twitter because they’re overwhelming every word of him and being interested in him.
He smiled to the “bad, pathetic” television scientists who are trying to understand him, and said, “It can’t!”
A number of Democrats have shaken Trump’s apology with the fact that it is just another proof that he is not eligible for the presidency.
The coffee shop dropped from the market price. now it returns to Greenpoint
Verb Cafe was a shunted place in Williamsburg where you could only pay in cash, without Wi-Fi, but where coffee has been served for 15 years.
It was naturally the case that she was printed out of the front of the house on Bedford Avenue.
Soap Cherie - the store that Verb replaced in the summer of 2014 - sells soap in the form of cakes.
It was the last loss of a growing city.
Artist Molly Crabapple wrote on Twitter: “New York is a change, I know, but I still can’t believe that CBGB is dead, Chelsea’s hotel is overwhelmed, and Verb is now a trade with soap.”
But if New York is a change, then it is also a rediscovery.
The Resurrected Verb Cafe opened last November in Greenpoint, less than a mile north of the original place.
The new Verb has wifi and receives credit cards, but some of the original employees work there and there is a similar, humble atmosphere.
Coffee is also good.
The manager of the new Verbu is Cisco Rodriguez, a long-time employee of the original cafe, who is also the owner and executive director of the new place.
In Verb began in 2001 and remained until the end.
When one of the customers offered him to pay for the transfer to a new place, he said he would do it with joy.
Rodriguez (36) left a lot of things as they were.
Verb still has the same bread supplier and bought the same model of the espresso machine.
He even again used the lighting from the old Verba.
But Rodriguez said he also wanted to try something new.
He started using new ingredients.
In the menu are sandwiches with shunk, egg and cheese and toppings, such as cabbage and fried cabbage.
You’ll also find a snack of brown rice.
The cafe no longer supplies beer, but offers you fresh fruit juices.
After nine months, Rodriguez noticed a constant flow of original stamps.
“A number of original customers had to move from Williamsburg because of the prices,” he said.
Last Sunday, one of these customers was here, Rebecca Oliveir.
Mrs. Oliveir (34) lived in Williamsburg and frequently went to Verb Cafe.
It even happened when the cafe moved to Greenpoint.
She said that when Verb closed, for a while she completely stopped drinking coffee.
“I found that what I like is coffee and culture in Verba,” she said.
Now she drinks coffee again, but on that day she instead of her usual ice coffee gave a mixed chai, another news.
Tom Rosenthal, another long-standing customer, has been dedicated to Verba since 2003.
He goes before work and always orders the same thing.
“On the fourth and eighth every day, I come here, like the clock, and they are already preparing my housekeep with everything and with butter for me,” he said.
Photo: Rodriguez said he wanted to try something new and add new ingredients to the menu.
Mr. Rosenthal continues to order what it is usual, but sometimes he will give a salad, an egg, and a shunk on his shell.
Rodriguez said he was not sorry that the soap shop took his old place.
The truth is that the owners of Soap Cherie offered him to make a special soap for Verb and use the filtered coffee from the cafe as an additive.
“I think we could still take advantage of it,” Rodriguez said.
Also, the traditional Polish inhabitants of the Greenpoint cafe accepted well.
One of the new customers translated the offer into Polish and Rodriguez said he wanted to find a place where he would soon expose it to make his new neighbors feel like at home here.
The new place has other advantages.
The local fruit juice manufacturer wants to stack into bottles and sell filtered coffee.
It offers the possibility for the cafe to expand to the neighboring building.
Many customers are enough to get back their old favorite.
Joseph Whitt was a regular customer and when the cafe closed, he said it broke his heart.
Mr. Whitt says that when the cafe is open again, entering and drinking coffee is like coming home.
“I missed the smell,” he said.
Depressive food from the time of crisis – in “Square Meal”
Shortly after taking office in March 1933, Franklin Delano Roosevelt was sitting in the Oval Workshop and spending lunch.
Labužnik President Roosevelt tasted on selected meals from 5th Avenue, such as a slurry of husses and a maryland shark soup.
But his menu for this day was more modest: eggs in the devil way in the paradise sauce, potato pyré, and as a dessert smooth pudding.
“It was an act of cooking solidarity with the people who suffered,” said Jane Ziegelman.
Her husband Andrew Coe added: “It was also a message to the Americans how they should eat.”
A couple living in Brooklyn Heights is dedicated to gastronomic history.
Andrew Coe’s last book “Chop Suey” was about Chinese cuisine in America, while Jane in her book “97 Orchard” tells the life story of a residential house on the Lower East Side through food.
Their new joint work “A Square Meal”, which Harper will publish on Tuesday, is the history of American cuisine during the great economic crisis.
They showed their cooking solidarity and met with the reporter for dinner in the Eisenberg sandwich shop, a small tight buffet in the Flatiron neighborhood, which has been operating since the crisis, since 1929.
Jane (54) ordered a cream cheese and a sandwich with cut olives, and Andrew (57) gave her crocana, potato cakes and mixed vegetables.
The reporter ordered a mass carbanate, which, according to the couple, was well suited to talk about food during the crisis.
“The carbanates were very popular,” Ms. Ziegelman said.
It was sold a bulk, liver and beef carbanate.
They were made from that mixture and other cheap foods that set the ingredient.
Create the amount of foods you need to eat for dinner.
And Andrew Coe was angry.
“They would lie in your stomach like a pen,” he said.
In the years before the crisis, American cuisine, especially in rural areas, was served in the form of a buffet of foods that you eat.
The women's teams cooked for the farm workers, and for breakfast, lunch and dinner a fresh cooked cake was served.
It was the Americans who sent food to the hungry Europeans during the First World War. “A Square Meal” follows how the nation was dealing with the fact that it was suddenly not a country of abundance.
“It was the time when food became a central, fearful point for the American people,” Coe said to explain why he and his wife decided to write about it.
The new budget diet was equally worried: Mysterious foods, such as carbanates and cabbage foods, and cabbage foods, were spread as a “wonderful way to take advantage of the remains,” Ziegelman noted, because chefs could hide unesthetic additives under a layer of cream sauce.
Fresh fruits were replaced with cheaper dried fruits.
Meat - for many years the central point of American food - has become a economically allocated luxury.
Strange mixture, which should serve as a calorie and nutritional filling, had preference over taste or even a healthy mind when cooking.
During the research for a book that contains recipes, Mrs. Ziegelman prepared a time meal from baked cheese filled with butter.
“It wasn’t a favorite add-on to the evening table,” said Andrew Coe.
Jane Ziegelman said, “It was surrealistic.”
Butter with baked butter does not go together.
It was typical for a lot of home recipes.
As never before and never after, domestic economists - among them Louise Stanley, the chief of the federal office for the domestic economy between 1923 and 1943 - governed the country's eating habits.
They published recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines, calling on women to take over the burden of the budget, and slides, such as cream spaghetti with carrots, turned into delicious foods.
The book “A Square Meal” is a celebration of historical flavours.
First of all, the snacks were created in the response of the government to its hungry citizens, such as President Herbert Hoover’s post “I’ll give me a cake.”
While he publicly praised his childhood’s simple Iowa farm kitchen, he stood as the chosen millionaire he became.
“He loved to eat continental cuisine like fish with corn sauce,” said Andrew Coe.
He ate in a almost golden room, wearing smoking.
He was incredibly ancient.
President Roosevelt would probably make the same mistake if his wife Eleanor did not make him go as an example with his own stomach.
As the book tells, Mrs. Roosevelt hired a hostess who was not interested in the taste at all. This led to the fact that the White House "not only served almost the most wealthy food throughout Washington, but also the most unpleasantly prepared."
A number of eating habits from the time of the crisis disappeared as the country again stood on its feet.
The link remained in our constant study of calories and nutritional values, says Mrs. Ziegelman, and in the way science applies to cooking.
The couple say that during the writing of the book they better understood Miss Ziegelman's mother's eating habits - for example why she couldn't throw out the food.
“She was really afraid of wasting food,” said Andrew Coe.
Ziegelman said, “The people were bad.”
There was an accident with the wheels.
When the tables were clean at Eisenberg, she and Mr. Coe pulled out the dessert they prepared at home: the snack dessert President Roosevelt ate for lunch.
“He’s called a smooth cream,” Ziegelman said, adding that the usual trick was to give the modest recipes elegant names.
There was no cream, just slices, a little flour, sugar, water and scratch.
Everyone unwillingly pulled a teaspoon into a thick brown matter.
Surprisingly it was bad.
Andrew Coe added, and then again.
And as the right farmer, he said to his wife, “It would be good for a little bit of crawl.”
Europeans: Migrants go for benefits.
Most of the refugees who come to Europe come for economic reasons.

Gilead is entitled to payment of legal representation fees in the case of a patent against type C yellowness against Merck Group
A court judge ruled that Gilead Sciences Inc. is entitled to reimbursement of the fees for the lawyers incurred by it in the proceedings regarding the patent against type C yellowness against the drug manufacturer of Merck & Co Inc.
In June, the ruling was abolished, according to which Gilead had to pay 200 million for damages due to the violation of two Merck patents in connection with the very successful medicines of Gilead, Sovaldi and Harvoni, after a federal judge found repeatedly illegal actions on the part of Merck, among other lies under oath and other unethical practices.
Federal judge Beth Labson Freeman said in the case on Thursday that Gilead has the right to forgive the fees incurred in connection with the representation in the case.
Merck is trying to reach Gilead, which dominates the market of new generation anti-Yellowness drugs that can heal more than 90 percent of patients with this liver disease.
The case comes from 2013, when Gilead and Merck appealed each other and claimed that they owned a basic laboratory research for sofosbuvir, the active component of the medicine from Gilead.
U.S. supported military units claim to have gained full control over the city of Manbij
U.S.-backed troops gained full control over the northern city of Manbij near the border with Turkey after the last Islamic State fighters fled from the city, a spokesman said on Friday.
The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) is now cleansing the city after the left of the rest of the group of radicals who hid in the city.
The units have released more than 2,000 civilians detained by radicals, Reuters said Sharfan Darwish from the Alliance of the SDF and the Manbij Military Council.
“The city is now fully under our control, but we are still searching for it,” he told Reuters.
In 2015, Clinton earned $10.75 million and paid a federal tax rate of 34.2 percent.
Hillary Clinton on Friday published her tax declaration for 2015, in which it is stated that the Democrat candidate and her husband had a revenue of $10.75 million in that year and paid a real tax of $34.2 percent.
Former President Bill Clinton contributed to the joint cash amount of almost a fee of $5.3 million for lectures, and the former Foreign Minister granted a revenue of $3 million from the publishing company Simon & Schuster for his book on his work at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
Clinton’s co-candidate, U.S. Senator Tim Kaine, from Virginia, and his wife Anne Holton have published a 10-year tax declaration.
In 2015, they paid a real tax of 20.3 percent.
“Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine continue to be a pattern of financial transparency,” Jennifer Palmieri said in a statement that helped Clinton with the campaign.
On the contrary, Donald Trump is hiding behind false excuses and withdraws from his earlier promises that he will publish his tax declarations.
It is a habit that the US presidential candidates publish their tax declarations, even if it is not required by the law.
Trump, a New York-based trader, and his lawyers quoted the audit of the U.S. Department of Finance as a reason for his refusal to publish the tax declaration.
“Your move,” Hillary Clinton’s campaign subsidiary tweeted and followed the Democratic candidate’s tax declaration.
Michael Cohen, Trump’s special adviser, told CNN on Thursday that he would not allow Trump to publish tax declarations until audits are over.
According to Trump’s critics, including Republican 2012 presidential candidate Mitt Romney and other Republican members agree that his refusal raises questions about his net profit, charity contributions, trade transactions and various other relations, including his relations with Russia.
Clinton is strongly standing up on the issue and on Friday she posted a video reminding how the high-ranking Republicans on Trump urge to publish their tax declarations.
The question will be mentioned on Thursday in his speech on economic issues in Michigan.
“She refuses to do what all the other presidential candidates have done for decades – to publish their tax declarations,” she said before the people.
Politico said Trump has paid no or very low taxes in the past two years of the 1990s, and the New York Times publisher quoted a number of tax advisors and accountants who claim that it may be so today.
Federal tax rates have become a topic in the presidential election.
Clinton is pursuing the rule named after billionaire Warren Bufett, which would ensure that everyone who earns more than $1 million a year will pay a tax of at least 30 percent.
President Barack Obama also supports the proposal.
Last week, Buffet at the Clinton Assembly in Omaza, Nebraska, where Buffet's Conglomerate Berkshire Hathaway is located, called on Trump to meet and exchange tax declarations.
Buffett said he also passed an IRS audit and that Trump is “not afraid” of the financial office, but of the voters.
The Clinton campaign published the tax declaration back until 2007.
Clinton, who now lives in Chappaqua, New York, paid an average federal tax of 32 percent between 2007 and 2014 and a combined tax of approximately 40,5 percent.
Clinton’s 2015 tax declaration shows that unlike most Americans, they make in their income salaries of just $100.
Their main investment was a low-cost mutual index fund, from which Clinton received $109,000 in dividends and interest revenues.

Condoms filled with chili or fireworks to protect elephants in Tanzania
Nature defenders in Tanzania use a neo-Orthodox way to prevent elephants from going into human houses - they throw on them condoms filled with chilli powder.
The Honeyguide Foundation, which came with the idea a few years ago, together with the American ecological organization The Nature Conservancy, promotes and trains volunteers in northern Tanzania’s villages to protect their homes and harvests without hurting animals through this non-violent procedure in four steps.
Many of them used copies for their defense.
Friday is the World Elephant Day dedicated to the protection of these animals.
“Since they have developed this ... set of tools, we have noticed a change in behavior in these communities. People are much more convinced that they can keep the elephants out of their fields without hurting them,” Honeyguide Foundation’s Executive Director Damian Bell said in a statement.
The first and second steps are to light the passing elephant with a battery and run the clakson.
If this does not prevent him, the so-called “chilli shell” will be thrown away.
The chilli powder mixed with salt, together with the petard, is packed into a preservative, its end is shed so that only a knot looks out of it.
After the burning, the preservative explodes and a delicate chilli powder disperses into the air.
Usually, one wing is enough and the elephant goes in a different direction.
The last option is a fireworks explosion, which will trigger a loud, bright explosion.
A Jewish director rushed to a Berlin hotel for removing the call code to Israel on the 'demand' of the Arabs - RT News
A French film director of Jewish origin raised the media after he found that the hotel Kempinski Bristol in Berlin has no call code in Israel, according to the employee’s words on the basis of the “request” of Arab customers.
Claude Lanzmann, the author of the documentary about the Holocaust “Shoah”, ventilated his frustration from the Kempinski Bristol hotel in Berlin in an open letter to the German newspaper FAZ.
During his recent stay, Lanzmann tried to find Israel in the hotel call codes list.
The state, however, was not listed among countries to which it is possible to call directly from the room.
How is it possible that in 2016 in Berlin, the capital of Germany, Israel was removed and deleted?
Written by Lanzmann.
Kempinski Bristol instead offers the possibility of calling to Israel through its own call center.
The director sought an explanation and with a problem turned to the hotel reception.
The answer he received, Lanzmann, according to his words, “shocked.”
The hotel employee replied that the measure was “decised by the management of Kempinski Hotels.”
The reason for this step was even more encouraged by the director.
“Most of our guests are Arabs and they demanded the Israeli call code to be deleted,” Lanzmann quoted employees in his letter.
According to the Suddeutsche Zeitung, Israeli ambassador to Germany Yakov Hadas-Handelsman called the case “a great shame.”
We were scared and shocked by the event.
It is a huge shame in itself.
The fact that something like that happened in Germany and in addition in such a hotel chain is even more shameful.
No further explanation is needed.
We expect the hotel to draw the right conclusions,” he said.
The event caused a strong online reaction, people called it a scandal.
Some believe that Hotel Kempinski simply “lost” in the demands of Arab customers.
“Sorry to you,” it is said in another post, pointing to the fact that the hotel, located in the noble Kurfurstendamm Street, stands near the synagogue.
According to the Spiegel newspaper, the hotel itself quickly rejected any accusations by calling the incident a “preview” and “forgiveness” to Lanzman.
"No direct order has ever been issued" to not include Israel in the list of call codes, the Suddeutsche Zeitung quotes representative of the Hotel Kempinski.
It adds that the call code has been added to the list.
Police use tear gas and rubber missiles against Brazilian students
A student and police strike occurred in Brazil’s San Paolo on Thursday when students gathered to demonstrate against government reforms in the public education system.
Police used tear gas and rubber missiles against the protesters.
The problem worsened when government orders tried to break the students, which ended with the police using rubber missiles and tear gas.
The demonstration attended several hundred students to express their concerns about the plans.
Among the proposals of San Paulo Governor Gerald Alckmina to save money is also closing almost a hundred public schools and moving 300,000 students.
Some of the participants in the demonstration were able to see spraying on the walls the inscriptions against the temporary president Michel Temer.
The latest protest comes just a few days after the protesters went massively to the streets in support of President Dilmy Rousseff, when the Senate in the country decided to accuse her.
Trade between Russia and Iran increased by 71% - RT Business
According to the Russian ambassador to Iran Levan Dzhagaryan, the trade turnover between Moscow and Tehran has increased by 70.9 percent over the year.
As the ambassador said, since the international sanctions against Iran were abolished, there has been an increase in interest from the Russian companies that trade in the country.
Russian companies are restoring existing ties with Iran, while new companies are ready to enter the market.
Further expansion of trade is, of course, one of the main priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran,” Dzhagaryan said.
He noted that during the first five months of 2016, the trade turnover between Russia and Iran increased by 70.9 percent compared to the same period in 2015 and reached $856 million.
Specifically, Russia’s export to Iran jumped 91.5 percent and reached $697 million.
Russian imports from Iran increased by 16 percent to $158 million.
The jumping growth of trade has been achieved by the supply of machinery, ground vehicles and weapons,” the ambassador said.
Dzhagaryan also expects that Russia will visit a record number of tourists from Iran this year.
Last year, the Russian diplomatic mission in Iran issued approximately 35,000 visas, mostly travel.
Iran is among the top 20 countries for the first time according to the number of tourists arriving in Russia.
It is safe to say that the record number of tourists from Iran in Russia from last year will be overcome,” he said.
At the same time, however, a relatively small number of Russians visit Iran. the ambassador hopes that there will be a change here.
“I can personally recommend a visit to the towns of Isfahan, Shiraz and Yazd, where the memories of ancient Persian civilization are in good condition,” he said.
Scot Callum Skinner runs home after the British got gold in cycling
Callum Skinner from Scotland entered the Hall of Fame last night in a male team sprint at the Rio Grand Prix, when the VB team's trio defended the 2012 London title.
The twenty-three-year-old resident of Glasgow was in the role of the brake he took for his Scott Sir Chris Hoy, and the young legend was pleased when he came to the goal and steal the victory from the hands of the favourite New Zealand.
Four years ago, Britain surprisingly won and Hoy won the fifth of its six Olympic gold medals.
And the same trick they repeated after the end of the modest sixth at the World Championship in Track Cycling in March, even though Hoy intermittently ended his career.
The problem between Beijing and London was the replacement for the specialized start-up rider Jamie Staff.
Hinduism appeared in time.
After Hoye's departure, the place was also released, which Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton tried to fill.
Skinner was the man of British coaches and the search for potential is now confirmed.
Kenny Hindes - who was champion with Hoy four years ago - and with Skinner reached an Olympic record in the qualification, but the trick took over in the first round New Zealand.
And the British trio won gold in the team sprint.
Hindes was slightly behind after their round, but Kenny's team pushed forward and Skinner held the lead.
The change of strategy was a big part of the transformation, when Hindes went to a higher transition to slow down and allow Kenny and, in part, Skinner to keep the pace.
Hoy watched the race from his position as a BBC commentator, and when Skinner, Kenny and Hindes came to the stage, he didn’t leave their eyes.
The twenty-three-year-old Skinner, a resident of Glasgow, said, “It’s a gentle comparison.”
I am here to get the best of myself and to honor my name.
We made the Olympic record in the final and defeated the best.
It was simply incredible.
There is no better way to win it.
After triumphing alongside Kenny and Hoye in London in 2012, Hindes admitted that he intentionally fell on the track after a weak start.
The note was later withdrawn back and the opponents of Britain had no chance to appeal.
There was no such problem this time around this victory.
Hindes said, “With all those British flags on the tribunes, I felt like in London.”
In the last three months, we’ve all been a team.
We lost in many world races, so to win the Olympics again is simply amazing.
It is one event, one gold medal for the nation who won seven out of ten competitions in Beijing and London.
If this is to be an indicator of progress over the past five months, then we are waiting for a successful five days on the Velodrome.
With the form Kenny showed, it’s not unthinkable that he would repeat Hoy’s success and win three gold medals at one Olympics at the same time.
That would then mean for Kenny - who is exactly a day 12 years younger than Hoy, also has birthdays on March 23 (this date seems to be sacred for British sport, this day celebrates birthdays also Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister) - a total of six gold and one silver medal.
How much he has earned.
As a next, Kenny will take part in the sprint, which starts today and will take another three days.
A twenty-eight-year-old citizen from Bolton said, “I’m enjoying this now.
The team race is always the best.
You win with others.
To say the truth, winning for yourself is a little lonely.
Hindes said, “When he wins another two gold medals, he should get the Knight’s title.”
It was the only medal race that day, but Britain was waiting for more good news.
Sir Bradley Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull qualified as the fastest in the four-kilometre race.
The time ended at 3:51.943.
The world record that fell in London in 2012 was 3:51.659.
The first round and final (22:42) will be held on the second day of the race, which Wiggins will focus on.
Yesterday before the qualification race he debated with the commissioners, when he was asked to measure the height.
In the similar women race, which continues and ends tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald of Milngavie reached the world record with time 4:13.260.
The VB team relied on its strong track cycling team and dominated the middle season of the Olympic Games and won a lot of medals.
After truly exceptional performances, demonstrating absolute superiority in Beijing and London, expectations decreased during the Rio preparations.
On the background were dramatic events, not least the resignation of the technical director Shane Sutton in April for accusations of sexism and discrimination, and the end of the career of giants such as Hoy or Victoria Pendleton.
However, as the first night of the races on the Velodrome shows, it seems that the legendary reputation that the UK team can give top performance with perfect timing could be re-confirmed.
The uncertain future of the Portland tavern after the end of the energy supply contract
The future of the Portland aluminum tavern in Victoria - and the jobs of hundreds of workers - is uncertain due to the power plant that the company supplies electricity and which informed the intention of one of the owners of the tavern to terminate the electricity supply contract.
This step takes place after the government of the state of Victoria earlier this year decided not to extend the granting that the company keeps in operation.
The fixed 20 year grant expires in November.
In Alcoa Portland, up to 2,000 jobs may be in danger.
At closure, up to 2000 jobs can be threatened - direct or indirect.
And since the tavern consumes about 10 percent of the total electricity produced in Victoria, there can be further lavinistic impacts.
Alcoa closed Point Henry in 2014, which led to the closure of the power plant in England last year.
Alcoa’s portland tavern is deadly and it is threatened to be closed.
This step follows after several years of speculation about the future of the company, initially in response to the strong Australian dollar and recently due to the prices for the production of the factory.
AGL, which supplies electricity from the Loy Yang A power plant in Latrobe Valley, said it expects one of the other three owners to also decide to terminate the contract.
The majority owner of the factory is the joint venture of Alcoa and Alumina, small business shares are held by the Chinese company CITIC and the Japanese Marubeni Corp.
“AGL expects that the Portland plant will continue to operate, in other words, that the demand for electricity from the tavern will continue,” she said.
AGL stated that the contracts are so-called “assurance contracts” which had to enter into force from November 2016.
The contracts have a 12-month termination, so their validity will actually end in 2017.
“AGL continues to assume that the contracts will be part of the profit for the fiscal year 2017,” the power plant said.
Any possible impact on the AGL profits from the fiscal year 2018 is currently limited due to the strong outlook of the commodity market for wholesale electricity prices.
AGL said it has already recorded the value of the contracts according to its accounts of $187 million “for the event that the termination occurred.”
Alcoa said that the decision to terminate the contract “no affects its ability to operate a tavern or to provide electricity to the tavern.”
The U.S. company said it signed a 20-year contract with Loy Yang in 2010, which was scheduled to start from November this year, although it still has to explain why it withdrew from the contract.
Analysts are very cautious with regard to the possible closure of the Portland tavern in Victoria and Tomago factory near Newcastle due to the weak economy in the industry.
AGL operating manager Stehpen Mikkelsen, who addressed analysts at the beginning of this week, said that Portland consumes about 600 megawatts of electricity per year and Tomago about 900 megawatts.
If both of these enterprises were withdrawn from the market, this would mean a substantial decrease in the demand on the [electricity] market.
It would not be good for us as a manufacturer,” he said.
Kendall is not only the real estate TV show star of Kardashian - now is the cover of the September Vogue
Kendall Jenner (20), a model and fourth daughter of the mother-manager of the clan Kris Kardashian-Jenner, appeared on the title page of the September edition of the American magazine Vogue.
Kendall, brand ambassador Estee Lauder, who showed at the fashion week in Milan, Paris and New York, announced the news on Thursday on her Instagram account.
“In a room full of people I love, I want to cry when I look at this title page,” Kendall wrote.
The discovery of the title page followed by a bizarre (or simply a continuation of the humor in the presentation of the Kardashian?) filmed video in which the whole family of the Kardashian-Jenner (colored scratchers Rob and Caitly and together with them all the favorite uncle from the show business, producer Keeping Up Ryan Seacrest). On the cover of their sisters they forgot, just so that the scene could end with a classic turn: they prepare a secret party.
It’s a narrative line of almost every “birthday” piece of a children’s television show (Seacrest tells, “Do you think we’ve forgotten you?” with the sincerity of a cartoon rabbit in the show at eight am), but Kris somehow needed to ensure that the other girls on this publicity could live.
Because when we look at the September number of the Vogue magazine, we’ve entered the new era of the Kardashian.
Kim's older sister may have Kendall pressed on the Vogue cover (she was on it together with her husband Kanye West in April 2014), but the title of the magazine's September edition is a different league.
The Vogue magazine is the best-selling number of the year.
The edition, which its thickness reminds more of a book for advertising purposes than a fashion magazine, attracts a number of advertisers (Fashionista estimated that from 832 pages in last year’s edition there were 615 pages with advertising content).
The discovery of the star that appears on the title page is unexpectedly expected, so it is no wonder that in the last two years the images of the magazine have escaped even before its official publication.
Women who appeared on the cover in the past include Naomi Campbell, Linda Evandelista or Kate Moss.
In the last few years, more “sellebrity making models” have appeared on the title page than “sellebrity making models.”
Jennifer Lawrence, the Oscar winner and Dior’s ambassador, appeared on the title in 2013, a year later, she was honored by Lady Gaga.
But even though it’s very unlikely that Kendall – which the magazine describes as a “through model” of her generation – will fall into the first category, it’s going to be in a very good company.
These celebrity are not the relatives of familiar people, nor the stars of real estate shows, or the children of today who know how to make a well cut video (although Jenner represents all this).
They are proven talented women who stand out in the entertainment industry.
Beyoncé, who appeared on the title page last year, had one of the strongest years in her career thanks to the release of the album Lemonade.
Of course, not everyone is excited about Jenner's success.
Her position in the world of fashion will always be difficult because of her participation in a reality show.
Stephanie Seymor, the original Victoria's Secret model in June, criticized Jenner and her colleague Gigi Hadid and called them "the girls of the moment."
These feelings were again angry with the news that Jenner will appear on the Vogue cover.
But this dissatisfaction is not in place.
Kendall Jenner is on the cover of the September Vogue.
It is a supermodel in the true sense of the word.
Showing for Mark Jacobse.
It is made up by Estee Lauder.
She and all her sisters sell you images of themselves on their own paywalls.
She sells the photos of the daughter of Cindy Crawford, which she photographed for the LOVE magazine.
And in the free moments she works in the reality show, just as one of the ways to see Kourtney and her children.
Community legal aid centers reject 160,000 people annually
More than 160,000 most endangered citizens are rejected every year in community legal aid centers, and in the sector itself they are going to have the effects that will have further restrictions on funding on already excessive services.
In Queensland, three out of five people – mostly older people, immigrants, endangered workers, victims of violence and people without funds to fight unfair displacement and so on – are rejected when they seek free legal assistance and representation.
Community legal services, which are already so tensioned to break down, are preparing for further cuts.
From June next year, these legal aid centers will lose another 30 percent of federal finances.
James Farrell, director of the Queenslad Community Legal Assistance Centers, said that according to the latest summary report of the National Association of Community Legal Assistance Centers, it was found that five thousand people are rejected each year.
Mr Farrell said that without the cancellation of the federal government's decision, the situation will worsen.
“Community Legal Assistance Centres in Queensland are chronically underfinanced, meaning thousands of people are rejected the vital services they need,” he said.
People who have escaped from relationships with a violent, people with excessive and shrinking debt, families passing through separation, workers who are unfairly released - all of these people have problems with legal dimensions and this report shows that they have no chance to get the help they need.
From June 2017, the federal government will reduce funding by 30 percent, which will lead to the fact that thousands of other endangered people from Queensland will have to be oriented into complex legal issues without assistance.
We call on Queensland Prosecutor and Senator George Brandis to prevent this financial cuts immediately, so that people get the help they need when they get into legal problems.
In the past year, the government has been committed to ensuring the financing of legal aid up to the national average.
Now it is time to look at the needs of community legal aid centers and the community of their clients and the Palaszczuk government has to invest in this important work.
Donald Trump's campaign after a staff member allegedly targeted a gun
New York: Donald Trump’s campaign was charged with alleged inactivity after they were informed that the North Carolina Operations Director targeted a gun on a staff member during a jeep drive in February.
The incident was described in a court file that was handed over on Wednesday at the Charlott State Court by Vincent Bordini, the former software trainer of the campaign in the state.
Bordini said he had been waiting months for the situation to be resolved internally before he came to the conclusion that “this will not happen.”
Director Earl Phillip “marked the fingers of the pistol, placed the right indicator on the launch and directed the head to Vincent on the cheek,” Bordini said in the appeal.
Bordini, after a complaint with the local and regional campaign leadership, found that at least four other people experienced the same with Phillip.
“The weapons do not need to shoot to cause harm,” Bordini said in the case.
The appeal comes just two days after the Republican candidate for the presidency caused an elevation when he told the North Carolina voters that weapons owners and holders could proceed (which is regulated in the U.S. in the second amendment to the Constitution) if his opponent Hillary Clinton is elected and will be able to appoint his judges.
Trump’s campaign says the media pulled his words out of the context and that Trump did not defend violence.
In the lawsuit, Bordini demands compensation from the campaign for negligent supervision and from Phillip for the threat to personal security, illegal use of violence and causing emotional harm.
Trump’s spokeswoman Hope Hicks did not immediately respond to the request for a comment.
The attempts to get an expression from Phillip were unsuccessful.
WCCB, a local intelligence branch in Charlotta, announced that Phillip recently left the campaign.
No one responded to the call to his Innovative Consulting Services consulting company in a short time.
The Republican candidate for President Donald Trump is conducting a controversial presidential campaign.

Britain has to spread the Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow
Heathrow will also be a source of restoration and prosperity not only for our local communities and across London, but throughout the country.
For me Heathrow is enormously attractive, just as it was London 2012, when we made extraordinary efforts to ensure that all of our nations and regions will be able to benefit from the Olympic Games.
The Olympic Games made huge benefits for Startford and East End.
And we will do it again by creating opportunities for local people and near Heathrow.
Only for our local communities, we will create 10,000 new teaching jobs, 40,000 new jobs and end the unemployment of young people around the airport.
Like before the 2012 London Olympics, there will also be those who will think that Heathrow’s expansion is too big.
I was told that Britain will never be ready for the Olympics and that we will be laughing on the world stage.
The suspects mistaken in 2012 and even in the case of Heathrow it turns out that they were not right.
It will always be necessary to overcome obstacles, but Heathrow can answer any question that concerns him.
Like the Olympic Games, Heathrow is an infrastructure project that involves many people and companies, not just a few.
The expansion is an opportunity to create 180,000 new jobs, economic growth of £211 billion, to leave heritage in the form of skills and employment both around the airport and throughout the UK.
We have a great team at Heathrow, who on a deadline and with a fixed budget introduced a 11 billion pounds infrastructure investment program, starting with the T5 terminal - which was chosen as the best terminal in the world five years in a row, after the T2 terminal, which was built among the two most busy ranways in the world.
Now they are ready to deliver a third ranway, which costs £16 billion of private investments.
The games in London in 2012 were a huge success for the UK and I am convinced that Heathrow’s expansion will be it too.
It’s time to further spread the spirit of the Olympic Games and expand Heathrow, ensure trade in the future and leave the inheritance of the skills and employment that Britain can be proud of.
Lord Paul Deighton is the Chairman of the Board of Directors and former Deputy for Business Affairs of the Ministry of Finance.
Adblock Plus - Facebook in the Cat and Mouse Game in Adblocking
From attempts to overcome advertising-blocking programs, it has become a cat and mouse game for companies that make money on online marketing.
On Thursday, just two days after Facebook announced that it will block advertising filters on its desktop pages, Adblock Plus on its pages posted a post in which it states that users can update filters in their program and re-block advertising on this social network.
Facebook said on Tuesday that its desktop website will change the encoding around ads, making it more difficult for advertising filters to find out which parts of the page are advertising.
But Adblock now claims that the new codes have already passed.
Adblock spokesman Ben Williams wrote in a blog post that “this kind of war between the open-source advertising blocking community and those who are trying to escape it has lasted since advertising blocking was invented,” and that Facebook is likely to come with another own repair.
The fact that the company owning the largest social network in the world has engaged in the war only demonstrates how big a problem the blocking of advertising for the industry has become.
According to a study conducted last year by Pagefair and Adobe, around 200 million people worldwide use advertising filters – almost four times as much as it was in 2013.
Mobile advertising now reaches 84 percent of Facebook’s advertising profits, with 1,03 billion active users visiting Facebook from mobile devices every day.
The spokesman said the company, however, goes against the advertising filters on the desktop because the mobile filters of advertising on mobile apps for social networks and Instagram do not work.
Advertising on desktop still represents profits so high that Facebook decides to invest in it.
Facebook also said on Tuesday it will update the “ad preferences” tool to give people the opportunity to better control how their ads are displayed.
On Thursday, Facebook said the new Adblock filters are concerned because they could also block content that is not related to advertising.
“It’s not a pleasant experience for people and we want to solve this problem,” a Facebook spokesman said in an email statement.
Blocking advertising is an insensitive tool, and therefore we prefer to focus on building tools such as Ad Preferences that give people control.
A woman crashed in a car on a Swiss highway
The victim was on the road in the middle of the night.
Police are searching for witnesses to the incident in which a woman who was likely to attempt suicide on the highway on Thursday in the morning had been trapped by several cars.
The accident occurred on the A1 highway near Morges in Vaud canton shortly after midnight on Thursday.
The police in Vaud said in a statement that the actress of the “desperate act” was in the darkness on the road and passed through several cars.
It is clear that the victim, a 49-year-old woman, wanted to kill herself and hit her several cars, including a truck.
He died in place.
A few drivers have already been heard, but according to the police, they are still not all identified. the police calls on these drivers and all the others who witnessed the accident to sign up.
A criminal investigation was opened, a “logical” step in a situation like this, advocate Gilles Hofstetter told Le Tribune de Geneve.
It is still necessary to find out if any of the involved drivers will face any charges.
Was it possible to prevent the attack?
This is what the prosecutor must find out,” Hofstetter said.
Based on two similar cases from the past five years it seems that drivers will not bear responsibility.
In both cases – one of which was a person walking the highway – it was decided that drivers can’t expect a pedestrian passing the highway in the middle of the night, as the newspaper.
Last year, a police officer was released from the accusation of murder due to negligence after in the night of August 2014 she crashed and killed a man who was lying on the A1 highway near Paynerne.
The court said the victim, aged 22 years old, was drunk and drowned on the road.
The court found that the police officer, who responded to the emergency calls, walked in a reasonable way and that the man’s presence on the road was “a completely exceptional and unpredictable situation,” the judge said.
Anyone with information about the Thursday incident that occurred at Morges should register to the police at 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44.
A tolerant city.
Prague is the favorite destination of the LGBT community.
The Association of Czech travel agencies and agencies (AČCKA) expects that up to 20,000 visitors will arrive in Prague Pride.
This was by the executive director of AČCKA Kateřina Petříčková on Friday.
The sixth year Prague Pride begins on August 8, the festival approaches the life of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT).
Last year about 35 thousand people participated in the event.
“Prague is one of the most popular destinations of the LGBT community, for a high level of tolerance and a wide range of specialized,” said Petříčková.
According to the organizers’ survey, foreign visitors spend an average of 3,100 SEK per person per day.
Gay tourists are available to support their travel special maps of Prague with a complete list of Prague gay and gay-friendly bars, clubs, cafes and restaurants in the form of mobile applications, etc.
“For tourism in general, LGBT clientela is very lucrative, interested in staying in higher price sessions with a high standard of travel services and spends more than others,” said Petříčková.
The first Pride Tourism Symposium will be held this year.
It is presented by experts from the LGBT tourism sector from Europe, the US and China.
The festival continues until Sunday, August 14.
The main theme of this year is love, but the event will also focus on several thematic areas such as family, AIDS prevention and transgender issues.
The peak of the festival will be on Saturday a traditional pass with algorithic cars, which will go from Václavsky Square to Summer.
The demonstration, which has been attended by thousands of people in the past years, this year commemorates a minute of silence to the victims of the June nightclub in Orland, where the attacker shot 49 people, mostly homosexuals.
Pat and Matt celebrate their 40th anniversary.
The unavoidable patterns Pat and Mat, whose effort usually ends with a disaster, have been entertaining both small and large spectators for forty years.
The pilot part of this evening series directed by Lubomir Beneš was released on August 12, 1976.
Following the creation of this animated series, which is now known to viewers in more than a hundred countries of the world, the cartoon jokes of the painter and director Lubomir Beneš, which he invented for the magazine with two shells Mr. Ouholíček and Sedlec.
Beneš then invited to collaborate with the dramatist Jiří Kubíček and the artist Vladimir Jiránka and jointly created the film Kuťáci.
Today's shape with the yellow and red trick and the curve and the radio was given by the characters in 1979, when the short film Prague began to create a series for Slovak television.
The names of Pat and Mat then kutil received in 1985, this time it turned directly for the Short Film Prague.
In 1990, Lubomír Beneš founded his own studio of animated film AIF Studio in Prague and Zurich, where other works were created.
After his death in 1995, further works were continued with other creators, many of them were involved by Beneš's son Marek.
Currently, there are more than ninety episodes with the stories of these curtains, whom everything sits under their hands, but never angry on themselves and are always full of optimism, ideas and curtains enthusiasm and ultimately are satisfied with their work, which will be demonstrated by a well-known gesture "...and it is!".
Pat and Mat even moved from TV screens to books, to DVDs and to the theater, and the characters or other toys with the picture of Pata and Mata are the hit of every toy industry.
A story for Fiji and for the two-year Harmony.
The end of the week is in the sign of fairy tales, we have chosen for you one sports and one of life.
Both have a good end.
So let’s go to see.
Fiji has achieved a historic success.
What is the reason for the joy of the whole world?
A two-year-old British girl has an identical girlfriend and is happy with her.
What are the things people spend most on the airports?
This is a Friday review from the world’s websites.
The first medal from the Olympic Games.
Historic success is celebrated by the island state of Fiji.
The Rugby selection of this island was defeated in the final of the Seven Rugby Olympic tournament by the United Kingdom team.
This is the first medal to be won by Fiji at the Olympics.
Waiting for the earnings of the first precious metal took 60 years since the first excursion to the Olympic Games was sent.
A great merit for the success is the coach Fiji.
But it’s ironic that he’s the British Ben Ryan.
The team has been leading since 2013 and after the final as a British citizen could be satisfied unlike its citizens.
“Let us play freely and easily and see if we can manage the biggest match in our history,” the coach said before the final.
Fiji finally dominated it sovereignly and the small state with 900,000 inhabitants is now experiencing the Olympic fairy tale.
This was by the French newspaper Le Monde.
Good luck and good luck for a little girl.
2 year old Harmonie-Rose Ivy Allen, who has lived 11 months without hands and legs, has got a new friend.
A doll that looks like her.
"Mommy, she's like me," the two-year-old girl was glad, as her mother told ABC News.
She added that her daughter loves dolls throwing their hands and legs and then sitting together without protheses.
Harmony was diagnosed with type B meningitis in less than a year of life, doctors gave it only a 10% chance of survival.
There is nothing I would not love for her.
She is beautiful, smart, funny and never give up.
He has an overview.
I saw her presenting herself to the other children with the words Hi, I am Harmony and I have no hands.
Look at what joy the doll has caused.
How much do we spend at the airport?
According to CNN, people in airports spend the most on packed water.
The Hudson’s travel essential stores chain has published data for the last year, where it summarizes the 10 products that customers in its shops at the airports buy most often.
Water was the first.
The drinks were generally very popular, with eight in the first ten.
The ninth place was occupied by a large package of M&M sweets with coconut flavour.
Can you guess who will finish the first 10?
As the only thing mentioned above, you can’t eat.
According to CNN, it is the Wall Street Journal.
Other popular newspapers sold at the airports include: The New York Post, The New York Times USA Today.
The magazines include US Weekly, In Touch and The Economist.
The sovereign.
We just go to win, Murray and Bond laughed.
Eric Murray and Hamish Bond from New Zealand have ruled sovereignly the category of couples without a controller for seven years and have confirmed their dominance at the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro.
At first glance, the untouched couple passed to a smaller crew after the Olympics in Beijing and has dropped the competition since 2009.
At the Laguna of Rodriguez de Freitas, they won the 69th in a row in the Thursday final.
What are we different from others?
We are just more beautiful, Murray laughed already during the Olympic regate when he had to answer questions about the domination of the New Zealand couple.
To be honest, we do nothing different from others.
We are training hard, hard.
And we are constantly trying to improve our technique, that’s our philosophy, Murray said more seriously.
Their domination is remarkable because they are physically different.
Murray is a almost two-meter and stack-cylinder cast, academically-looking Bond is five centimeters smaller and 15 kilograms lighter.
They also have a different nature.
Bond studies and finances, and Murray has a charitable boxing match.
Even because of this, they don’t spend a lot of time together.
Eric goes to the ship in essence with the fact that we can’t lose.
We are just going to win.
I have a tendency to think about what might be wrong, Bond acknowledged, who even on a press conference clearly showed that the dominant in the crew is Murray.
He always responded first and Bond was waiting for his opportunity.
On the water, however, they destroy the opponent with a quiet force.
They go their pace, and although often still in the middle of the track they are not in the forefront, for their gradual acceleration yet opponents have not found a recipe.
We run on a two-kilometre track and we never wanted to go the first kilometre upwards.
We just try to run a pace that no one else can.
We know what we have to do to win, said the thirty-four-year-old Murray.
With his four-year-old partner, he won seven gold medals at the World Championship.
They triumphed in 2007, when both members of the Golden Four were without a kormidelnik.
Just after an unexpected failure, a larger crew at the Olympics in Beijing a year later decided to move to a double without a controller.
At the Olympics in London, the biggest defeat in their career was revealed and the dominance was confirmed in Rio.
London was very intense.
We did everything the coach told us, and they didn’t ask anything.
This time it was a bit more fun.
We knew it would be devastating hard, and we had to make sure we were mentally well on it, Murray said.
We all want to get rid of the throne.
We always have that target on our back.
But we are trying to be half a step ahead of all, he added.
NASA's climate model: Venus was once habitable
According to NASA’s new climate model, Venus was once habitable.
Scientists at NASA’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies have developed a model to explore Venus using tools and algorithms similar to those used by scientists involved in the study of climate.
The model was designed to determine whether once on Venus, whose surface is hot, water-free and CO2 saturated, conditions could be similar to the conditions on Earth.
Scientists have previously suggested that the low rotation rate of Venus can be explained by its density of atmosphere.
According to the latest simulations, however, it seems that Venus once could be proud of a rare Earth-like atmosphere, while turning slowly.
The model also dealt with the previous topography of Venus.
The planet’s areas were probably dryer than the Earth, but once there was enough water and geographical diversity to dominate life and provide protection against rapid evaporation.
Venus used the Sun, which was 30 percent more suppressed.
“In the simulation of the GISS model Venus during a slow rotation exposes its daily side to the sun for almost two months at once,” GISS scientist Anthony Del Genio explained in a new report.
This is the way the surface is heated and the formation of rain, which creates a thick layer of clouds that behave like a shadow and the surface protects against excessive solar heat.
The result is a climate with average temperatures that are actually slightly lower than currently on Earth.
The model compiled the story of Venus similar to the evolution, which was previously hypothetically compiled by planetary scientists.
Although Venus was probably habitable in the past — over a few billion years — it was exposed to excessive heat and ultraviolet radiation.
Its oceans were evaporated and the water vessels were burned by ultraviolet light.
The hydrogen escaped and there was only a density atmosphere of carbon dioxide with the deadly effect of greenhouse gas—this is Venus, as we know it today.
The researchers have published their results of the new climate model of Venus in the Geophysical Research Letters.
Patrick Roy resigns as Colorado Avalanche coach
Patrick Roy on Thursday resigned from his post as coach and vice president of the Colorado Avalanche team's hockey operations, as a reason he stated the impossibility of participating in the decision-making process in team issues.
Colorado Executive Vice President/General Manager Joe Sakic confirmed the move and said the club will start looking for a new coach immediately.
“The last three years I have been the chief coach and vice president of the Colorado Avalanche hockey operations, with energy, passion and determination,” the 50-year-old said in a statement.
For a long time and intensely during the summer I thought about how I could improve the team, give him the depth he needs, and get him to a higher level.
To this, it is necessary that the vision of the coach and vice president of the hockey operations be in line with the vision of the organization.
They must also be able to participate in decisions that have an impact on the performance of the team.
These conditions are currently not met.
Sakic, who received Roye on May 23, 2013, thanked him for his contribution to the team.
“Patrick informed me about his decision today,” Sakic said.
We appreciate everything he has done for our organization and wish him good luck in the future.
Roy was nominated to win Jack Adams as the best coach of the league during his first season with Avalanche 2013/2014.
The team gained 112 points and the first place in the Central Division. however, Colorado faced Minnesota in the first round of play-off and in the last two years he had not always played after the season.
The Avalanche team in the 2015/2016 season reached a score of 39:39:4 and missed five points to win the second wild card in the Western Conference.
The goalkeeper Roy, who entered the Hall of Fame, won the Stanley Cup four times — twice with Montreal Canadiens and twice with Avalanche.
North Sea Oil Platform Workers Renew Talks and Stop Strike
The top representatives of the negotiating parties said the strikes for the wages for the North Sea oil platform workers are being interrupted, while all the parties in the dispute gathered for a new round of negotiations.
The strikes against the oil field services company Wood Group occurred sporadically on the North Sea platforms operated by Royal Dutch Shell.
“Wood Group and unions Unite and RMT can confirm that they have agreed to restore the process to resolve current disagreements,” the statement said.
Starting next week, we will have a series of day-to-day meetings over the coming weeks, where we will try to look at the problems from new angles.
According to trade unions, their recent action, which, according to them, was the first in more than 25 years, is to protest up to 30 percent against wage cuts.
Wood Group lowered rates this year and paid its North Sea suppliers about 9 percent less due to negative market pressure.
Companies’ interest rates decrease comes after a 10-percent decrease for coastal companies in 2014.
The company claims that further cuts would provide companies with room to cope with market decline.
On the other hand, Shell has removed thousands of people from its payments and announced plans to leave oil and gas operations in up to 10 countries due to the modernization of its processes – immediately after a mega fusion with the British energy company BG Group.
Energy companies are under pressure due to low oil prices, the economic situation associated with the June decision of Britain to leave the European Union.
Scottish parliamentary member Dave Anderson met with trade union leaders earlier this week to discuss one of the greatest working disputes of the whole generation that led to the strike in the North Sea.
The North Sea, as he said, is vital for the economy in the region.
“In the North Sea and throughout the country, we need an economy that works for all, not just for some,” he said in a statement.
For comparison, in 2016 it is expected to invest $1.4 billion in new projects in the North Sea, while the average in the last five years was around $7 billion.
Kepler measures the speed of the rotating of the stars in the Pleiades
The latest mission of Kepler's space telescope to help astronomers is to obtain a almost complete list of the rotating speeds of the stars from the Playout.
New data help astronomers understand why the stars in a star group rotate at different speeds, and also how the time of rotation is related to the formation of the planet.
“We hope that by comparing our results with other star groups we will learn more about the relationship between the star matter, its age and even its history in its solar system,” said Luisa Rebull, a researcher at the Caltech’s Infrared Processing and Analysis Center in Pasadena.
Playa is located 445 light years from Earth.
Many of the stars in the shell are now in adulthood and have emerged over 125 million years ago.
It turns the fastest.
In the moments of maximum rotation speeds, these adolescent stars release an enormous amount of star wind.
Because these winds move along the magnetic fields of the stars, they have a slowing effect on them.
As the star ages, its rotation speed also slows down.
Kepler measures the rotation rate of each star by measuring the time between the discovery of identifiable points on the stars — similar to the sun's spots.
According to the latest data on rotation speeds, larger stars turn slower than less massive stars.
The rebel compares the stars to the dancers, the larger make the piruets slower than the smaller.
“In the ‘ballet’ of the Plejad, we see that the slower rotating stars are more massive, while the fastest rotating stars are usually very light,” Rebull said.
Because the Playout is so close, it serves as the ideal space laboratory for comparing the quality of the stars and the speed of rotation.
“The plays provide us with a coat for theoretical models of star rotation in both directions, for younger and older stars,” Rebull said.
There is still a lot we want to learn about how, when and why the stars slow down their rotation speed and thus saying “they will hang their dance shoes on their nails.”
Rebull and her colleagues detailed the latest analysis of the Plejad rotation speed in three studies, which will soon be published in the Astronomical Journal.
Is a qualification agreement necessary?
If I did not apply, then would the qualification agreement not be concluded and after a few months I could go to another hospital?
Is it possible to work after graduation without enrollment in specialization education?
It’s about me that in the field I’d like to work, there’s now a vacancy in a slightly distant hospital, but in about a half year it could be a vacancy in another where I’d like to work.
I don’t know how to deal with the situation about that six months, the question continues.
The answer is Mr. Wolf.
No legislation stipulates the obligation to conclude a qualification agreement with the employer - the hospital.
A qualification agreement is a legal institution regulated by the Labor Code and may be concluded between the employee and the employer in order to ensure the return of the costs incurred in connection with the increase or deepening of the qualification of the employee.
In the field of health care, there is a long-term pressure to not conclude these agreements with a view to ensuring the mobility of health workers and not all hospitals are currently requiring this agreement.
According to Law No. 95/2004 Coll., on the conditions for the acquisition and recognition of professional qualifications and specialized qualifications for the exercise of the medical profession of a doctor, a dentist and a pharmacist, the participation in specialized education is considered to be a deepening of qualifications (not to increase them).
This means that the qualification agreement can be concluded according to the Labour Code only if the costs reach at least CZK 75,000.
There is no legal obligation to apply for specialization.
The law only establishes the conditions for the application for inclusion in the field of specialization education.
However, according to law, a doctor is entitled to perform the profession of a doctor already thanks to the completion of the necessary university studies, even if under the law-defined conditions (under the professional supervision of a doctor with specialized qualification in the relevant field).
The law provides for a situation in which professional experience completed in another field of specialization may be included in the doctor's specialization training, provided that its content and scope correspond to the relevant educational program.
In theory, it would be possible to calculate the time worked elsewhere, which would correspond to the questioner's situation.
However, having regard to the fact that I do not know the closer circumstances of this case, it may be recommended to consult the relevant department of the Ministry of Health (the department of science and medical professions), since the Ministry of Health by law provides a consulting and consulting service related to the inclusion into specialized education and its course.
The consultancy service is also provided free of charge by the Czech Medical Chamber, the member of which every doctor must be.
Doctors from the Syrian Halab are calling for US intervention.
The United States did not make any efforts to end the occupation (the rebellion parts of the city by government troops) and did not use its influence to promote the protection of civilians, the White House letter quoted by the agency AFP.
“We don’t need tears, compassion, and even prayer; but we desperately need to create an air-free zone over the eastern Halab to stop attacks, and we need an international action to ensure that Halab will not be surrounded again,” the doctors said.
The Russian forces, which support the army loyal to President Bashar al-Assad, announced that they will stop attacks every day for three hours in the Halab area to allow a safe passage to humanitarian convoys.
From 9:00 to 12:00 SELČ all military activities, air attacks and artillery shooting are to be stopped.
U.N. head of humanitarian operations Stephen O'Brien welcomed this, but stressed the need for at least two-day ceasefire.
15 of the 35 doctors operating in the eastern part of Halab, which is controlled by the rebels, were addressed to Obama in a letter.
He writes that during the five-year war they witnessed the violent, cruel deaths of countless patients, friends and colleagues.
The world sees and constates how complex Syria is, but it does little to protect us.
Recent offers of evacuation of the inhabitants from the Syrian regime and Russia sounds like a slightly hidden threat, said pediatricians, surgeons and other doctors.
Doctors said 42 attacks on medical facilities in Syria were recorded over the past month, 15 of them on hospitals in which they work.
The most sad is that we have to decide who will live and who will die.
At emergency, small children with such serious injuries come to us that we have to choose among them those with the greatest chance they will survive.
And sometimes we don’t even have the necessary material to help them, the doctors describe.
Two weeks ago, four newborns drowned when the explosion interrupted the supply of oxygen to their incubators.
They lapped after breath and then their life ended - before they could actually begin, they remembered.
The military loyal to President Bashar al-Assad, supported by the Russian forces, in recent weeks surrounded the rebels-controlled eastern part of Halab, where more than 200,000 people were without food supplies.
The rebels, who are under constant attacks by the Russian and Syrian air forces, were able to break the surroundings on Saturday after three weeks and launch an anti-offensive.
Both sides were subsequently strengthened in the city and its surroundings.
