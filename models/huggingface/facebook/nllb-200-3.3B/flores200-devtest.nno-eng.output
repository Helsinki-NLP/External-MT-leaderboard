This not only confirms that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, a widely held theory, but also provides details that fossils generally cannot, such as colors and three-dimensional arrangements.
Researchers say that this animal's feathered coat was chestnut brown on the upper part with a bleached or carotenoid-colored underpart.
The find also provides insight into the evolution of feathers in birds.
Since the feathers of dinosaurs did not have a well-developed shaft, called a rachis, but had other features of feathers  barbs and barbules , researchers assumed that the rachis was most likely a later evolutionary development than these other features.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used in flight, but rather for temperature regulation or display, and although this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the specimens show a mature feather-drought and not the plumage of a bird's tongue.
The researchers noted that although this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the specimens show the feathered coat and not the tail of a young bird.
A car bomb detonated at the police headquarters in Gaziantep, Turkey, on the morning of yesterday, killing two police officers and injuring more than 20 others.

The luminosity and rotation are used to determine a star's Rossby number, which is related to plasma flow.
The smaller the Rossby number, the less active the star is when it comes to magnetic reversal.

The work that had been done was mostly theoretical, but the program was written to simulate observations made of the Sagittarius galaxy.
The effect the team was looking for would be a result of the tidal force between the galaxy and the Milky Way's dark matter.
Just as the Moon exerts a gravitational force on the Earth that causes tides, the Milky Way exerts a gravitational force on the Milky Way galaxy.
The researchers were able to conclude that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way that ordinary matter does.
This theory says that most of the dark matter around a galaxy is located around the galaxy in a kind of glory, and is made up of many small particles.

In France, voting has traditionally been a low-tech experience: voters isolate themselves in a box and place a pre-printed paper seat indicating their choice of candidate in a convoluted box.
After the official verifies the voter's identity, the voter puts the ballot box and signs the voting form.
French civil law codifies the treatment relatively strictly.
Since 1988, ballot boxes have been made to be transparent so that voters and observers can see that no convolutters are present at the start of the voting process and that no convolutters are added except those of carefully selected and authorized voters.
Candidates may send representatives to follow any part of the process, and in the evening, the votes are tallied by volunteers under close observation and following specific procedures.

In her second Grand Slam, she came in tenth in the women's sitting group with a combined time of 4:41.30, 2:11.60 minutes slower than the winner Claudia Loesch, from Austria, and 1:09.02 minutes slower than ninth-place Gyöngyi Dani, from Hungary.
Four skydivers in the women's seated group failed to complete their turn, and 45 of the 117 total skydivers in the grand slalom failed to rank in the heats.
The Madhya Pradesh police found the stolen laptop and mobile phone.
Assistant police inspector general D K Arya said, "We have arrested five persons who assaulted the Swiss woman and have recovered her laptop and mobile phone".
They are referred to as Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar and Vishnu Kanjar.
Police Chief Inspector Chandra Shekhar Solanki said that the accused appeared in court with their faces covered.
Although three people were inside the house when the car struck it, none of them were injured.
The driver of the car was severely injured.
The road where the crash occurred was temporarily closed while emergency services freed the driver from the raucous Audi TT.
He was first admitted to the James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was later transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya has since been charged with the murder of his son in Edinburgh's court of justice.
She is awaiting remand and trial, but eyewitness evidence has been manipulated as her photos have been widely published.
This is common practice elsewhere in the UK, but Scotland's legal system operates differently and the court has deemed the publication of the images to be possibly biased.
Professor Pamela Ferguson, from the University of Dundee, said: "Journalists seem to be taking a dangerous direction if they publish photos and similar of suspects".
The Crown Prosecutor's Office, which has overall responsibility for prosecutions, has indicated to journalists that it will not be giving any further commentaries in any case until the prosecution.
According to the leak, the document will refer to the border dispute, which Pakistan wants based on the pre-1967 borders of the Middle East.
Other topics covered, according to reports, include the future of the state of Jerusalem, sacred to both nations, and the Jordan Valley conflict.
Israel requires an ongoing military presence in the valley for ten years after an agreement is signed while the Palestinian authorities are only limited to such a presence for five years.
The shooters in the supplemental damage control's test project were to be monitored thoroughly by the weighers while the effect of the test project was assessed and monitored.
In a partnership with Tenesta for National Parks and Wildlife and Sports Shooter's Organisation of Australia (NSW) Inc., qualified volunteers were recruited to the Sports Shooter's organisation's hunting programme.
According to the current director of Park Conservation and Heritage at Tenesta for National Parks and Wildlife, the first four selected shooters for the first shooting operation received safety and training instructions.
Martelly swore in a new nine-member provisional electoral council (CEP) yesterday.
This is the fifth time Martelly has been elected in four years.
Last month, a presidential commission recommended the former provisional election council's resignation as part of a package of measures to guide the country toward new elections.
The commission was Martelly's response to a widespread anti-regime protest that began in October.
Occasional violent protests were triggered by the failure of elections, some dating back to 2011.
It has been reported that about 60 cases of iPods have been overopted, leading to a total of six fires and four people suffering minor burns.
The Department of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said it was aware of 27 accidents related to the units.
Last week, the Ministry of Trade and Industry announced that Apple had informed them of 34 more cases of over-optimization that the company called "not serious".
The Department responded by calling Apples's postponement of the report "extremely regrettable".
The quake struck the Marianas at 07:19 local time (21:19 GMT on Friday).
According to the Northern Mariana Islands Crisis Management Agency, no damage was reported to the Commonwealth.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also said there was no sign of a tsunami.
A former Philippine policeman took Hong Kong tourists hostage when he hijacked their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza used an M16 rifle when he shot the tourists.
Several hostages have been rescued, but at least six people have been confirmed dead so far.
Six hostages, the children and the eldest, were released at an early date, and so were the Filipino photographers.
The photographers then took the place of an elderly woman who had to go to the bathroom, and Mendoza was shot.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and began a career in medicine.
He trained as a midwife and began working at Auckland's National Women's Hospital in 1959.
While working at the hospital, Liggins began researching premature birth in his free time.
His research showed that if a hormone was administered, it could cause the fetus' lungs to mature.
Xinhua reported on Wednesday that government investigators had found the two "black boxes" containing the plane's audio recordings.
Other athletes also praised Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said "Luna was the first drewn of extreme. My first manager. Luna died on the night of two moons. Quite unique, just like her. Strong Woman".
Dustin Gullstøv Runnels commented that Luna was as crazy as I was...maybe even more so...love her and will miss her...hopefully she is in a better place.
A poll of 1,400 people prior to the 2010 federal election showed that the number of people opposed to Australia becoming a republic has increased by 8 percent since 2008.
The interim Prime Minister Julia Gillard stated during the 2010 federal election campaign that she thought Australia should become a republic by the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
34% of those who took part in the poll shared this view and wish that Queen Elizabeth should become Australia's last monarch.
At the top, 29 percent of those asked thought Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent thought Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist was scheduled to swim the 100m and 200m freestyle and in three relays in the Commonwealth Games, but his complaints have raised questions about his form.
He has not been able to take the necessary medications to overcome his pain, as they are illegal in the games.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number on January 25.
Several people verified the challenge using various hardware and software at the beginning of February, and it was announced on Thursday.
Comets may have been a source of water supplies to Earth, along with organic material that could form proteins and support life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets take shape, especially how the Earth took shape since comets collided with the Earth long ago.
Cuomo, 53, began his term as governor earlier this month and signed a bill legalizing same-sex marriage last month.
He referred to the rumors as politisk prat and tull.
He is expected to run for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that the U.S. Air Transportation Safety Board claims can allow aircraft to fly shorter routes, saving millions of gallons of fuel each year and reducing emissions of carbon dioxide.
It uses satellite-based technology in place of older ground-based technology to allow air traffic controllers to locate aircraft with better precision and provide pilots with more accurate information.
No additional services have been added and the train over the ground will not stop at Wembley, in addition to the parking and car park facilities not being available at the venue.
Fears of a lack of transportation have raised the possibility that the fight will take place behind closed doors without the team's supporters.
A study published in the journal Science on Thursday reported the formation of a new species of bird on the Ecuadorian Galápagos Islands.
Researchers at Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that the new bird species evolved after only two generations, although this process was believed to have taken much longer, due to the breeding of the endemic Darwin's finch, the mid-earth spur, and the immigrant cactus, Geospiza conirostis.
Gold can be worked into any formation, or rolled into very small shapes.
It can be spun into a thin thread that can be twisted and braided, or it can be hammered and rolled out to sheet.
It can be made very thin and attached to other metals, so thin that it can sometimes be used to decorate hand-painted images in books called "opplished manuscripts".
This is called a chemical's pH, and you can make an indicator using the juice of kale.
The candle changes color depending on the acidity or base of the chemical.
The pH level is indicated by the amount of Hydrogenions (H) in the test chemical.
Hydrogenions are protons that have been striped for electrons (since hydrogen atoms consist of a proton and an electron).
Mix the two dry powders to make a ball with your clean, wet hands.
The moisture on your hands will react with the outer layers, which will feel strange and form a kind of shell.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo had a spyle toilet in almost every house, connected to a sophisticated sewer system.
Remains of the sewerage system have been found in the houses of the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini in Greece.
Toilets also existed in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China, and in the Roman civilization, they were sometimes part of public baths where men and women were present together.
When you call someone thousands of miles away, you're using a satellite.
The satellite in space is receiving the object and reflecting it back down, almost as if it were going around.
The satellite was launched into space by a rocket. Researchers use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts some of our view.
It takes a big rocket that's over 100 feet high to put a satellite or a telescope into space.
The wheel has changed the world in incredible ways. The greatest thing the wheel has done for us is to give us much easier and faster means of transportation.
It has given us the train, the car and many other transport units.
Among them are more medium-sized cats that eat medium-sized prey ranging from hares to antelopes and deer.
Finally, there are many small cats (including loose pet cats) that eat a much more varied selection of small prey such as insects, rodents, lizards and birds.
The secret of their success is the concept of niche, a special job each cat has that keeps them from competing with others.
Lions are the most social of cats and live in large groups called flocks.
Flock is made up of one to three adult male lions, along with as many as thirty lionesses and their cubs.
The Lovin's are usually related to each other, and are a large family with sisters and daughters.
Lions are very similar to a wolf pack or dogs, animals that are surprisingly similar to lions (but not other large cats) in behavior, and also very deadly to their prey.
As a highly flexible sportsman, the tiger can climb (though not so well), swim, jump long distances and draw with five times the strength of a strong human.
The tiger is a member of the same group (genus Panthera) as lions, leopards, and jaguars, and is the only cat that roars.
The tiger's roar is not as powerful as that of a lion, but more like a set of growling, roaring words.
Ocelots prefer to eat small animals, and they will catch monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds if they can; almost all animals that the ozelot hunts are much smaller than these.
Researchers believe that ozelots follow and find animals to eat (bytte) by smell, they sniff until they have been on the ground.
They have night vision, which allows them to see very well at night, and they also move very smoothly.
When a small group of organisms (a small population) is separated from the main population from which they originate (such as if they move over a mountain range or a river, or if they move to a new island so that it is difficult for them to return) they will often find themselves in a different environment than the one from which they originated.
This new environment has different resources and other competitors, so the new population will need different characteristics or adaptations to become a strong competitor, than they needed before.
The original population has not changed at all, and they need to continue to adapt as before.
Over time, the new population has started to adapt to their new environment, which causes them to become more and more different from the other population.
Eventually, after thousands or millions of years, the two populations will be so different that they can no longer be considered the same species.
We call this process "species formation", which means the formation of new species.
Plants produce the oxygen that humans breathe, and they take in the carbon dioxide that humans exhale (in other words, exhale).
Plants make their food from the sun by photosynthesis, and they also provide shade.
We make our houses from plants and we make clothes from plants and most of the food we eat is from plants and without plants, animals could not survive.
Mosasaurus was a top consumer in its day, so it feared nothing except other mosasaurs.
The long-jawed males were surrounded by more than seventy silver-tipped teeth, and with an extra set of jaws, there was no way out for those who crossed the path.
We don't know for sure, but he may have had a split tongue, his diet included shellfish, large fish, other mosasaurs, he may even have been a cannibal.
He attacked everything that went into the water - even the giant dinosaurs, such as Tyrannosaurus rex, were no object to him.
While most of their food would be familiar to us, the Romans did add some unusual dishes to their feasts, including wild boars, peacocks, snails and a type of rodent called the shusovars.
Another difference was that while poor men and women ate their meals sitting down, the rich men liked to have banquets together while they were lying on their sides when they ate their meals.
Ancient Roman meals could not have included foods that were introduced to Europe or America from Asia in later centuries.
They didn't have, for example, corn, tomatoes, potatoes, cocoa and no Romanians had ever tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built a primary temple to each of their gods, which they considered their home.
People brought sacrifices to the gods, and the priests tried to take care of the needs of the gods through ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open courtyard and a free inner courtyard, to which only priests had access.
Sometimes, pyramidal towers, called ziggurats, were built as part of the temple complex.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary for the god.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, the house was not particularly important.
Most of the life of the Hebrew family was spent outdoors.
The women cooked on the courtyard; the shops were open disks facing the street, and the stone was used to build the houses.
There were no large forests in the land of Canaan, so woodwork was extremely expensive.
In the Norse sagas, Erik the Red is said to have been banished from Iceland for murder, and when he traveled further west he found Greenland and named it Greenland.
Although he made this discovery, there were already Eskimo tribes living there at this time.
Although each of the countries was skandinaviske there were major differences between the people, kings, customs and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland.
If you've seen the movie National Treasure you might think that a tax map was drawn on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
This is not true, though, because even though it says something on the back, there is no tax card.
Written on the back of the Declaration of Independence are the words original declaration of independence dated July 4, 1776, and the text at the bottom of the document, upside down.
While no one can say for sure who wrote it, it is known that the large parchment document (measuring 293⁄4 inches by 241⁄2 inches) was rolled up for storage early in its life.
So it's very likely that the notation was simply added as a marker.
The D-Day landings and subsequent battles had liberated the northern part of France, but the southern part was still not liberated.
It was ruled by the French Vichy regime, which had made peace with the Germans in 1940 and cooperated with the invaders instead of fighting them.
On 15 August 1940, the Allies invaded southern France, the invasion became known as Operation Dragon.
In just two weeks, the Americans and independent French forces had liberated the south of France and were on their way to Germany.
A civilization is a unified culture shared by a group of people of significant size living and working together, a society.
The word civilization derives from the Latin word civilis, meaning civil, related to the Latin civis, meaning city, and civitas, meaning city or city state, and in a sense also defines the size of society.
City states are the drivers of nations, a civilizational culture insinuates the transmission of knowledge across generations, a lingering cultural imprint and equitable dissemination.
Minor cultures often disappear without leaving relevant historical evidence and fail to be recognized as proper civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, the thirteen states first formed a weak central government with the Congress as its only component under the decisions of the Confederacy.
The Congress lacked any power to impose taxes, and, lacking an executive or judicial body, it relied on state authorities, who were often uncooperative, to enforce all its decisions.
Nor did it have the authority to override tax laws and interstate tariffs.
Acts required unanimous consent of all the states before they could be changed, and the states so easily relied on the central government that their representatives were often absent.
Italy's national football team, along with Germany's national football team, are the second most successful football teams in the world, and were FIFA World Cup winners in 2006.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fekting, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey and F1 motor racing.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern regions, with Italians competing in international games and Olympic events.
Japan has almost 7,000 islands (Honshu is the largest), which makes it the 7th largest island in the world!
Due to the clusters of islands it has, Japan is often referred to, from a geological perspective, as an  archipelago.
The origins of Taiwan go back to the 15th century when European seafarers passing through recorded the name as Ilha Formosa, or Beautiful Island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan, initiating a transformation of its native grain production practices and employing Chinese workers to work on its rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683 Qing dynasty forces (1644-1912) took control of Taiwan's western and northern coast, and in 1885 declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire.
In 1895, after the defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, which transferred the sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the country until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main structures, namely the Intihuatana, the Sun Temple and the Room with the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings at the edge of the complex have been reconstructed to give tourists a better idea of how they looked in the beginning.
By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been reconstructed and the rebuilding process continues today.
For example, the most common still image format in the world is 35mm, which was the dominant film size at the end of the analog era.
It is still produced today, but more importantly its aspect ratio has been inherited by digital camera sensor formats.
The 35mm format is actually, a little bit confusing, 36mm in width and 24mm in height.
The aspect ratio of this format (divided by twelve to obtain the simplest full-length ratio) is therefore 3:2.
Many common formats (the APS family of formats for example) are similar to, or approximately the same as, this side ratio.
The much-criticised and often derided rule that thirds are a simple line of inquiry that creates dynamics while maintaining a measure of order in images.
It states that the most effective placement for heads is at the intersection of lines, which divide images into vertical and horizontal threads (see example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become wealthy and powerful, came under scrutiny.
For over a thousand years, Christianity had bound together European states, despite differences in language and customs.
It had an all-encompassing power that affected everyone from the king to the common citizen.
One of the most important Christian principles is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that the money of the church is there for this very reason.
The central authority of the Church had been in Rome for over a thousand years, and this concentration of power and money caused many to question whether this principle was being met.
Shortly after the outbreak of hostilities, Britain initiated a naval blockade of Germany.
The strategy proved effective in cutting off vital military and civilian supplies, though this blockade broke with generally accepted international laws, codified by several small international agreements over the past two decades.
Britain was mining in international waters to prevent all ships from sailing into the whole sea area and was damaging even neutral ships.
Since there was a limited response to this tactic, Germany expected a similar response to its unlimited submarine warfare.
During the 1920s, the prevailing attitudes of most of the inhabitants were pacifism and isolation.
After witnessing the hardships and heartbreak of war during the First World War, nations wish to avoid such a situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to take a job at the Edison Company in New York City.
He came to the United States with 4 cents to his name, a book of poetry, and a testimony from Charles Batchelor (his former manager in his previous job) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of describing different periods of time; each stage of China and each family in power became a distinctive dynasty.
Also between each dynasty was an unstable age of divided provinces, the best known of which was the Three Kingdoms epoch of 60 years, between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During these periods, there was frequent warfare between many nobles who fought for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest eras in ancient Chinese history, thousands of people died while fighting for the highest seat in the great palace of Xi'an.
There are many social and political effects, such as the adoption of the metric system, a shift from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism and the belief that the country belongs to the people and not to a single ruler.
After the revolution, there were also open positions for all male applicants, allowing the most ambitious and successful to succeed.
The same was true for the military, where rankings were based on rank rather than on class.
The French Revolution inspired many other people, from the oppressed working classes of other countries, to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was very interested in matters outside of his daily life, often using a mine known as Hira on the mountain Noor (light) for his musings.
The tomb itself, which survived through the ages, gives a very vivid picture of Muhammad's spiritual decline.
The mine sits on the top of the mountains north of Mecca, and is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
It's not really easy to find, even if you know it exists, because when you're inside the mine, you're completely isolated.
There is nothing to see but clear, beautiful clouds above, and the many mountains around. Very little of this world can be seen or heard from inside the mine.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World still standing.
The Great Pyramid was built by the Egyptians in the third century BC, and is one of the many pyramidal structures built to honor the deceased pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau or Giza necropolis in the Egyptian Valley of the Dead contains several pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the largest), several small tombs, several temples and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built to honor Pharaoh Khufu, and many of the smaller pyramids, tombs and temples were built to honor Khufu's wives and family members.
The up-arrow mark looks like a V and the down-arrow mark like a stift or square is missing on the underside of it.
Up means you should start at the top and push the bow, and down means you should start at the frog (which is where your hand holds the bow) and pull the bow.
An up-bending usually produces a softer sound, while a down-bending is stronger and more determined.
Make your own notes, but remember that the markings are there for a musical reason, so they should usually be respected.
The surviving King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (Marie Therese, aged 11, and Louis-Charles, aged 4) and the King's sister, Madam Elizabeth, were forced back to Paris from Versailles on October 6, 1789, by a mob of market women.
They returned to Paris in a wagon surrounded by a mob of people shouting threats against the king and queen.
The crowd of people forced the king and the queen to keep the carriage windows wide open.
At one point a member of the mob held up the head of a royal guard who was killed in Versailles, in front of the living queen.
The war expenses of American imperialism in the Philippines were paid by the Filipino people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the American colonial regime to cover a large part of their expenses, and they were interested in bonds issued in the name of the Philippine government through Wall Street banking.
The super-profits derived from the prolonged exploitation of the Filipino people would, of course, constitute the basic achievements of American imperialism.
To understand the Templar Knights, one must understand the context in which they were created.
The era of these events is usually referred to as the High Middle Ages, the period of European history in the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (c.
The High Middle Ages followed the Early Middle Ages and were followed by the Late Middle Ages, which by convention ends about 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a wide range of ideas, from technological development or the technological imperative, to a strict sense that the human destiny is driven by an underlying logic linked to scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general ideas: that the development of technology itself feels a way beyond cultural or political influence, and that technology in turn has effects on the society that is emerging, rather than social impact.
One could say, for example, that the motor vehicle will necessarily lead to the development of roads.
However, a nationwide road network is not economically viable to service a handful of cars, so new production methods are being developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
Public ownership also increases the number of accidents on the road, which in turn leads to the discovery of new techniques for treating injuries.
Romanticism had a large element of cultural determinism, drawn from writers such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, the individualized geography was formed, and over time the customs and culture related to this geography emerged, and these, which were in harmony with the place of society, were better than arbitrarily imposed laws.
Just as Paris is known as the fashion capital of the contemporary world, Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its reputation as a center of luxury began in about 400 AD and lasted until about 1100 AD.
This status was reduced during the twelfth century, mainly due to the fact that the Crusaders had returned with gifts such as silk and spices that were valued higher than what Byzantine markets could offer.
It was at this time that the title of the capital of fashion, from Constantinople to Paris, was transferred.
Gothic style peaked in the period between the 10th and 11th centuries and the 14th century.
At the beginning, the dress was very much influenced by the Byzantine culture of the East.
The traditional wooden communication channels could delay the western styles by 25 to 30 years.
In the late Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the major developments of the modern era was the result of the Crusaders.
Agriculture for livelihood is agriculture practiced for the production of food to meet the needs of the farmer and his/her family.
Agriculture of livestock is a simple, often organic system that uses stored seeds from the eco-region combined with avlingsrotation and other relatively simple techniques, to maximize yield.
Historically, most farmers were engaged in agriculture for livelihood and this is still the case in many developing nations.
Subcultures bring together like-minded individuals, who feel neglected by societal standards, and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures may be characterized by age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender of their members.
The qualities that define a subculture as distinct may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographic, or a combination of factors.
Members of a subculture often signal their membership through a distinctive and symbolic use of style, which includes fashion, behavior, and argot.
One of the most common ways of illustrating the importance of socialization is to highlight the few unfortunate cases of children who, through neglect, accident or deliberate abuse, were not socialized by adults as they grew up.
Some children have been abandoned by humans (usually their own parents); in some cases, this abandonment of children as a result of their parents' rejection of a child's serious, intellectual or physical disabilities.
Children may have experienced child abuse or trauma, before being abandoned or removed from their homes.
Others have been claimed to have been raised by animals; some have been thought to have lived alone in the wild.
When fully raised by non-human animals, would-be children exhibit behavior (within physical limits) almost completely similar to that of their caregivers, such as fear or indifference to humans.
Whereas project-based learning should make learning easier and more interesting, constructivist design takes learning a step further.
Constructed design is not a learning method, but rather a tool to support individuals engaging in a new learning experience, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
A sticker can be both virtual and real, in other words, a teacher is a form of sticker, but so is the little binders-man in Microsoft Office.
Virtual simulators are internalised in the software and are meant to ask questions, guide, and explain procedures that might have been too demanding for the student to handle on their own.
Children are placed in foster care for a wide variety of reasons ranging from neglect, to abuse and even to extortion.
No child should have to grow up in an environment that is not nurturing, caring and educational, but they do.
We look at the child protection ordinance as a safety zone for these children.
Our child protection agency is meant to provide safe homes, caring caregivers and stable education, as well as reliable healthcare.
Foster homes were meant to cover all the needs of the children who were missing in the homes they were taken from.
The Internet combines elements of both mass and interpersonal communication.
The distinctive characteristics of the Internet led to its multiple dimensions in terms of its approach to use and satisfaction.
For example, learning and socialization are suggested as important motivations for networking (James et al., 1995).
Personal involvement and constant relationships were also identified as new motivational aspects by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they examined audience reactions on websites.
The use of video recording has led to important discoveries in the interpretation of micro-impressions, facial movements lasting a few milliseconds.
In particular, it is claimed that one can detect a person's lying by interpreting the micro-expressions correctly.
Oliver Sacks, in his essay The President's Speech, indicated that people who are unable to understand speech as a result of brain damage, are still able to assess distance correctly.
He even suggests that such a capacity to interpret human behavior may be shared by domestic animals such as dogs.
Research in the twentieth century has shown that there are at least two stocks of genetic variation: hidden and expressed.
Mutation adds new genetic variation, and selection removes it from the range of expressed variation.
Segregation and recombination move the variation back and forth between the two forests with each generation.
In the savannah, it is difficult for a primate with a digestive system like a human to meet its need for amino acids from available plant sources.
And failure to do so has serious consequences: growth depression, malnutrition, and finally death.
The most available panteressurane would have been the proteins available in leaves and berries, but these are difficult for primates like us to digest.
In contrast, not only are animal foods (e.g., ants, termites, eggs) digestible, but they also make a high amount of protein containing all the necessary amino acids.
Given all this, it shouldn't be surprising if our own ancestors solved their protein problem in some way similar to how chimpanzees in the savannah do today.
Sleep disturbance is the process of intentionally waking up during your normal sleep period and falling asleep again shortly after (10-60 minutes).
This can be done simply by using a silent alarm to bring you to consciousness without waking you up completely.
If you find yourself resetting the clock in your sleep, it could be placed on the other side of the room, forcing you to get out of bed to set it off.
Other biorhythmically-based alternatives involve drinking plenty of fluids (especially water or tea, known as water-driven fluids) before sleep, which will force one to stand up to urinate.
The amount of inner calm a person feels is the opposite of the amount of tension in one's body and mind.
The lower the stress, the more positive the vitality, every person has the potential to find absolute peace and contentment.
Anyone can access it, and the only thing standing in the way of that goal is our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but was expanded by the Haikayan way of love and by many techniques from Indian Yoga.
The Tibetan Buddhism is very simple in principle, consisting of Kundalini yoga, meditation and the path to all-embracing love.
In Kundalini yoga, the Kundalini energy is awakened through the practice of yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras, and visualization.
The center of Tibetan meditation is the god-yoga, where through the visualization of various gods, energy channels are cleansed, chakras are activated, and information consciousness is created.
The Soviet Union and the United States were enemies in World War II, and their mutual hostility led to the end of the war, and the two countries' conflicting systems, processes, and cultures were no longer at odds.
Two years after the end of the war, the two were allies and the Cold War began.
It would last for the next 40 years and was fought on real, proxy battlefields from America to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places.
By 17 September 1939, the Polish defense was already broken, and the only hope was to withdraw and reorganize along Romanian lines.
However, these plans were delayed overnight, as over 800,000 soldiers of the Soviet Red Army entered and created the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts, after having invaded the eastern regions of Poland in violation of the Riga Peace, the Soviet-Polish non-aggression pact and other international treaties, both bilateral and multilateral.
Using ships to transport goods is clearly the most effective way to move large numbers of people and goods across the seas.
The job of the Marines has traditionally been to ensure that your country retains the ability to move people and goods, while at the same time, impeding your enemy's ability to move their people and goods.
One of the most recent examples that is most noteworthy of this was the North Atlantic campaign of the Second World War, in which the Americans tried to move men and material across the Atlantic to help the United Kingdom.
At the same time, the German Navy tried to stop this traffic, mainly by means of submarines.
If the Allies had failed, Germany would have probably conquered Britain as well as the rest of Europe.
Goats appear to have been domesticated for the first time about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Animal husbandry was started in ancient cultures to have easy access to milk, hair, meat and skin.
Domesticated goats were normally kept in flocks that grazed on high ground or other grazing areas, often herded by shepherds who were often children or young - a form of herding.
Railroad tracks of wood were built in England as early as the 16th century.
Although these rails consisted of parallel wooden planks, they enabled the horses to reach higher speeds and to pull heavier loads than on the rough roads of the time.
The use of the shovel was relatively early in keeping the skins in place, but gradually it was realized that the skins became more effective if they were fitted with a little iron on top.
This became common, but the iron caused greater wear on the three-wheeled carriage.
The three-wheeled vehicle was eventually replaced by the iron wheel, and in 1767 the first rails, made exclusively of iron, were introduced.
The first known form of transportation is walking, and humans, known as Homo erectus, started walking upright two million years ago.
Their predecessors, the Australopithecus, did not regularly perform their feats.
Two-legged specializations have been found in Australopithecus fossils from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can start being nice to the environment, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even become activists to reduce the future burden to some degree.
This is the same thing as treating symptoms in many cases, but if we want to get away from just a temporary fix, we need to find the root of the problem and solve it in that way.
It is obvious that the world has changed a lot because of the scientific and technological advances of humans and problems have been increased by overpopulation and extravagant lifestyles of humans.
After the Congress adopted the declaration on July 4, a handwritten draft signed by the president of the Congress, John Hancock, and the secretary, Charles Thomson, was sent some quarters further away to the printer John Dunlap.
During the night, between 150 and 200 copies were printed, now known as the Dunlap broadsides.
The first public reading of the document was given by John Nixon in front of Independence Hall on July 8.
A copy was sent to George Washington on July 6, who read the document to the troops in New York on July 9. On August 10, a copy arrived in London.
The 25 "Dunlap broadsides" that are known to survive are the oldest extant copies of the document, though the original handwritten copy has not survived.
Many paleontologists today believe that one group of dinosaurs survived and are alive today.
A lot of people don't think of them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and they can fly.
But the birds have many similarities to dinosaurs.
They have feet with shells and claws, they lay eggs, and they walk on their two hind legs just like a T-Rex.
So virtually all computers that are in use today are based on manipulating information that is coded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can have only one of two values, i.e. 0 or 1, and these numbers are called binary siffers  or bits, for the sake of data jargon.
It is not always easy to detect internal poisoning, as symptoms (such as vomiting) can be so diffuse that it is impossible to diagnose immediately.
The best indication of internal poisoning is an open pill box or toxic household chemicals in front of you.
Check the label to find out what kind of first aid you are to give for the drug in question.
In formal usage, entomologists use the term insekt for this group of insects.
This concept is derived from the old familiarity with wall animals, which are insects very well adapted to be parasites on humans.
Both predators and wall-dwelling animals are nidicolae, adapted to live in nests or in the house of their host.
In the United States, there are approximately 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), making it the most common neurological disease in younger and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which is the brain, spinal cord, and visual nerves.
According to research, women are twice as likely to get MS as men.
A couple might decide that raising a baby isn't in the best interest of them, or the child.
This couple can choose to adopt the baby.
By adoption, the biological parents give up their parental rights, so that another couple can become parents of the child.
The main goal of science is to find out how the world works, through the scientific method. This method serves as the guideline for most of the scientific research.
But not only that, experimentation is also used an experiment is a test that is used to eliminate one or more possible hypotheses by asking questions and making observations.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts, and especially the Bible, in Latin.
Aristotle's view of everything related to science was accepted, including psychology.
As knowledge of Greek declined, the West was torn away from its philosophical and scientific roots.
Many observed rhythms in physiology and behavior are often highly dependent on the presence of endogenous cycles and the production of these through biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms, which are not simply responses to external periodic signals, are documented for most living organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants and animals.
Biological clocks are self-acting swinging generators that will continue to have periods of free cycling, even when there are no external signals present.
The Hershey and Chase experiment was one of the leading theories that DNA was genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages, or viruses, to implant their own DNA into a bacterium.
They performed two experiments in which they either marked the DNA in the radioactive phosphorus phage or the protein in the radioactive sulfur phage.
Mutations can have a number of different effects depending on the type of mutation, how important the affected genetic material is, and whether the affected cells are kimberly cells.
Some mutations in the kim cells can be passed on to children, while mutations elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism attracts people who are interested in visiting natural areas to see the beautiful landscape, including plant and animal life.
Examples of activities include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, visiting parks and studying information about the ecosystem.
Another example is to visit, photograph and learn about orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people take the car and leave small suburbs to go to work, while others pass by them on their way to work at the place they just left.
In this dynamic transport back and forth, everyone is somehow connected to, and supports, a transportation system based on private cars.
Research now suggests that this massive CO2 economy has disrupted the biosphere from the stable state that has underpinned human evolution for the last two million years.
Almost everyone in society uses transportation systems, and almost everyone complains about them.
In the developed world, you rarely hear as many complaints about the quality of water or bridges collapsing.
Why do transportation systems get so many complaints and fail every day? are transportation engineers simply incompetent? or is there something more fundamental going on?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the intersection of those points.
Unfortunately, it is difficult to study traffic flow because we cannot predict the driver's behavior with 100% certainty.
Fortunately, drivers tend to behave within a reasonably stable range, and traffic flows are thus often fairly stable and can be represented roughly mathematically.
A relationship between the three main characteristics has been established to better represent traffic flow: (1) flow, (2) density and (3) speed.
These conditions are useful when planning, designing and using road facilities.
Insects were the first animals to learn to fly, and their ability to do so made it easier to avoid enemies and to find food and mates.
The advantage of most insects is that they can spread their wings backwards along their body.
This gives them a choice of several small places to hide from predators.
The only insects that cannot penetrate the wings are the eye stingers and the night flies.
Many thousands of years ago a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system moved around the sun.
Some believed him, but many believed the opposite, that it was the solar system that moved around the earth, including the sun (and all other stars).
It's not so strange, because it doesn't feel like the earth is moving, right?
The Amazon River is the second longest and largest river on Earth, containing more than eight times as much water as the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on earth, at some places 9.5 km wide.
A full 20 percent of all the water that goes out of all the Earth's rivers into the ocean comes from the Amazon basin.
The mainstream of the Amazon River is 6387 km long, drawing water from thousands of small streams.
Although the stone pyramid building continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the Giza pyramids were never surpassed in size and technical performance.
Ancient Egyptians in the New Kingdom marveled at the monuments of their predecessors, which were well over a thousand years old.
The Vatican City State has a population of about 800, making it the smallest sovereign state in the world with the lowest population.
The Vatican City uses italics in its legislation and official communications.
Italian is also the language of daily life for most of the working people of the state, while Latin is often used during religious ceremonies.
All of the inhabitants of the Vatican City are Roman Catholic.
The basic chemical elements of gold, silver and copper have been known to mankind since antiquity, as they all occur naturally and are relatively easy to extract with primitive tools.
The philosopher Aristotle had a theory that all things were made of a mixture of one or more of four elements, namely earth, water, air, and fire.
This was more like the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas and plasma, although he also created a theory that they change into new substances and form what we see.
Alloys are mixtures of two or more metals, and they are also the elements that are found in the periodic table.
Elements like calcium and potassium are counted as metals and of course there are the metals silver and gold.
You can also have alloys that are made up of small amounts of non-metallic elements, like carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter, and all matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so extremely small that there's room for many billions of them in the period at the end of this sentence.
The pencil was therefore a good friend to many at the time of its discovery.
Unfortunately, the pencil has been downgraded to a lower status and is used less and less as newer writing methods have been introduced.
People now write notes on computer screens and never need a pencil sharpener.
We just wonder what's going to happen to the keyboard when something new comes out.
The atomic bomb works on the principle that it takes energy to put together a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
It's like pushing a heavy truck up a hill, and then when you split the nucleus, some of that energy is released.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, meaning that they are separated from each other with little or no interaction.
The surface of the moon is made of rocks and dust, and the outer layer of the moon is called the crust.
The shell is about 70 km thick at its nearest point and 100 km thick at its farthest point.
It is thinner under the dark areas and thicker under the light areas.
There may be more marshes on the nearest side because the crust is thinner, and it was easier for lava to rise to the surface.
Content theories are centered around figuring out what motivates people, or what appeals to them.
These theories suggest that humans have certain needs and/or desires that are internalized as we grow into adulthood.
The theories look at what it is about certain people that makes them want the things they want, and what it is in their environment that makes them do or not do certain things.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs and Hertzberg's two-factor theory.
Generally, there are two behaviors that can arise when leaders start hiring colleagues that they were previously on the same level with. At one end of the spectrum, you have the leader who is trying to keep on being "one of the gang".
This type of leader has trouble making unpopular decisions, correcting employees, conducting evaluations, assigning responsibilities and holding employees accountable.
At the other end of the spectrum, you have the leader who becomes a complete stranger, and who feels that he or she has to change everything that the group has been doing and make it their own.
After all, it is the seventh and final leader who is responsible for both the ups and downs of the group.
This behavior often results in conflict between the leaders and the rest of the group.
Virtual teams have the same superior standards as conventional teams, but there are subtle differences.
Virtual group members often serve as the point of contact for the nearest physical group.
They often govern themselves more independently than conventional group members because their groups often meet at varying times, which may not be met with understanding by the local leadership.
The fact that groups are indeed us (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p109) is also a unique component of a virtual group.
The invisible group is the leadership group to which each member reports, and the invisible group sets the standards for each individual member.
Why would an organization go through such a time-consuming process as establishing a learning organization?
When all available resources are used efficiently in all the functional departments of an organization, creativity and inventiveness can flourish.
One result of this process of an organization collaborating to tackle an obstacle is that it leads to a new innovative process to meet the customer's needs.
Before an organization can become innovative, leadership must establish a culture of innovation in addition to shared knowledge and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) defines the Continuum approach as a method used to help organizations achieve higher performance.
Nevrobiological data provide physical evidence for a theoretical approach to the study of cognition, and thus the research area becomes narrower and much more accurate.
The correlation between brain pathology and behavior supports the researchers in their research.
It has long been known that various types of brain injuries, traumas, lesions and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in certain mental functions.
New technologies are allowing us to see and examine brain structures and processes that we have never seen before.
This gives us a wealth of information and material to build simulation models that can help us understand what's going on in the brain.
Although science fiction strongly associates artificial intelligence (AI), AI is a very important part of computer science when it comes to handling performance, learning and intelligent adaptation in a machine.
AI research involves building machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples of this include control, planning and scheduling, the ability to respond to diagnoses and questions from customers as well as handwriting, voice and face recognition.
These things have become separate disciplines that focus on providing solutions to real problems.
The system is now widely used in the fields of economics, medicine, technology and the military and is incorporated into several PC-apps and video game-apps.
Excursions are a big part of teaching, and often a teacher might think of taking students to places where they cannot travel by bus.
Technology offers solutions with virtual excursions, where students can view museum artifacts, visit an aquarium, or admire beautiful artwork while sitting in the classroom.
Sharing a virtual excursion is also a great way to reflect on a trip and share experiences with future classes.
For example, every year, students at the Bennet School in North Carolina design a website about their trip to the largest city in the state, rebuilding the website, but keeping old versions online as a sort of scrapbook.
Blogging can also help students improve their writing skills, and although students often start blogging with poor grammar and spelling, this usually changes when they gain an audience.
Since students are often the most critical audience, the blogger begins to strive to make his writing better to avoid criticism.
Blogging also encourages students to "understand the world around them better" and the need to satisfy the audience inspires students to be smart and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that inspires collaboration and encourages students to learn something outside of the traditional school day.
Proper use of blogs can enable students to become more analytical and critical, by actively responding to material on the Internet, students can define their positions in the context of others' texts and sketch their own perspectives on particular issues (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is the charming bilingual capital of Canada, and home to a number of art galleries and museums that showcase Canada's past and present.
Further south lies Niagara Falls, and its northern part is home to the untouched and naturally beautiful Muskoka.
All of this and more highlights Ontario as the most typical Canadian city for foreigners.
Large areas further north have fairly scattered settlements, and some areas are near wilderness.
Here's a comparison that surprises many: There are more African Americans living in the United States than there are people in Canada.
The East African Islands are located in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is the world's largest and most diverse continent in terms of wildlife.
Most of the smaller islands are independent nations, or are associated with France, and are known as luxury resorts with beautiful beaches.
The Arabs also brought Islam to the islands, and it had a great influence on the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 14th century when the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the Kapp route from Europe to India.
To the north, the region is bounded by the Sahel, and to the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: It is recommended that all female travelers state that they are married, regardless of actual civil status.
It also helps to wear a ring (not just one that looks too expensive).
Women should be aware that cultural differences can lead to what they would consider harassment, and it is not uncommon to be followed, taken in the arms, etc.
Be firm in rejecting men, and don't be afraid to stand your ground.
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 9th century BC and was used by the Phoenicians, Romans and Mererids as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed the city and rebuilt it under the name Casa Branca, but abandoned it after an earthquake in 1755.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city as Daru l-Badya, and it was named Casablanca by Spanish traders who established trading posts there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to shop in all of Morocco.
Around the old medina, you can find traditional Moroccan goods such as tagine, ceramics, leather goods, water pipes and a whole range of fjas, but everything is for tourists.
Goma is a tourist town in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, located in the far east of the country, near the border with Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was devastated by lava from the Nyiragongo volcano, and most of the city streets, especially in the city center, were covered by lava.
Goma is relatively safe, but if you are going to travel outside Goma, you must investigate carefully to find out how the situation is in the province of North-Kivu with regard to the ongoing conflict there.
It is also used as a base camp for those who want to visit the Nyiragongo volcano, and is the starting point for those who want to take one of the most affordable tours in Africa to see mountain gorillas.
You can use the boda-boda (motorcycle van) to get around Goma. The usual (local) price is ~500 Congolese francs for a short trip.
Combined with its relatively difficult accessibility, Timbuktu is often used as a metaphor for exotic, distant lands.
Today, Timbuktu is a city of poverty, although its reputation makes it a tourist attraction, and it has an airport.
In 1990, the city was added to the World Heritage List of World Heritage in Danger, due to the threat posed by desert sands.
It was one of the big stops in Henry Louis Gates's program, Wonders of the African World, which aired on PBS.
The city contrasts sharply with the rest of the country, being more Arabic than African in style.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the north-east of South Africa, bordering Mozambique to the east and Zimbabwe to the north, with the Crocodile River forming the border to the south.
The park covers an area of 19 500 km2 and is divided into 14 different ecological zones, each with different animal and plant life.
It is one of the main attractions of South Africa and is regarded as the flagship of the South African National Parks (SANParks).
Like all South African national parks, the park has a nature management fee and an entrance fee.
You can also buy a Wild Card, which gives you free entry to either selected parks in South Africa or all national parks in South Africa.
The island of Hong Kong gives its name to the territory of Hong Kong and is the place many tourists see as their main destination.
The parade of buildings that make up the silhouette of Hong Kong has been compared to a glittering column of water that opens Victoria Harbour.
The best way to see Hong Kong is to leave the island and take the Kowloon Beach Line on the other side.
Most of the urban development on Hong Kong Island is concentrated on volcanoes along the northern coastline.
This was the place that the British colonizers took as their own, so if you want to see evidence of the colonial past of the territory, this is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans is the largest marshy area in the world, stretching 80 km inland from the coast of Bangladesh and India.
The Sundarbans is a UNESCO World Heritage Site and the part of the forest that is in Indian territory is called Sundarbans National Park.
The forests are not just mangrove swamps, but also some of the last remaining remnants of the enormous jungles that once covered the Ganges Strait.
The Sundarbans cover an area of 3850 km2, of which about a third is covered by water/myr area.
Since 1966, the Sundarbans has been a wildlife and plant reserve, and it is estimated that there are now 400 Bengal tigers and around 30 000 Akshash herds in the area.
Buses run from the bus station (on the other side of the river) all day, although most, especially those with a course towards the east and Jakar/Bumthang, run between 06.30 and 07.30.
As these buses are often full, it is wise to buy tickets a few days in advance.
Most districts have small Japanese Dei Coaster buses that are comfortable and solid.
Shared taxis are a quick and comfortable way to travel to nearby places, such as Paro (No. 150) and Punakha (No. 200).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a skyscraper bridge that spans the Oyapock River and connects the towns of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The two towers are 83 metres high, the bridge is 378 metres long and has two arches that are 3.50 metres wide.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 metres, construction was completed in August 2011 and the bridge opened to traffic in March 2017.
The bridge is scheduled to be fully operational by September 2017, when the completion of the Brazilian toll controls is expected.
The Guaraní were the main group of people living in what is now called the East of Paraguay, where they lived as semi-nomadic hunters who also made their livelihood from agriculture.
In the Chaco region, other indigenous groups such as the guaycurú and the payaguá survived by hunting, fishing and logging.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, formerly known as the "Giant Province of the Indies", arose as a result of the encounter between Spanish conquerors and native indigenous groups.
The Spanish began a period of colonization that lasted three hundred years.
Since its founding in 1537, Paraguay has managed to preserve much of its indigenous identity and distinctiveness.
Argentina is known for having one of the best polo players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year takes place at the polo grounds in Las Cañitas in December.
At other times of the year, tournaments and smaller-scale matches are held.
Contact the Asociación Argentina de Polo to learn more about tournaments and where to buy tickets for polo games.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Pound (FKP) with a fixed exchange rate to the British Pound (GBP).
You can change money in the only bank on the islands, in Stanley, on the other side of the FIC West store.
British pounds are generally accepted everywhere on the islands, and in Stanley credit cards and US dollars are also commonly accepted.
On the outer islands, credit cards are unlikely to be accepted, although British and US currency may be accepted.
It's almost impossible to exchange pounds outside the islands, so you should do this before leaving the islands.
Since Montevideo is south of the equator, it is summer there when it is winter in the northern hemisphere, and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropics, and in the summer months temperatures above +30 °C are common.
The winter can be miserable cold, with temperatures rarely below the freezing point, but the combination of wind and high humidity means that it is known to be colder than the thermometer indicates.
There are no special rainy or dry seasons, but there is about the same amount of rainfall throughout the year.
Although many of the animals in the park are used to seeing humans, the wildlife is still wild, and one should not feed or disturb the animals.
The park service asks you to stay at least 100 meters away from bears and wolves and 25 meters away from all other wild animals!
No matter how compassionate they may seem, bison, deer, elk, bear and most other large animals can attack.
Every year, many visitors get injured because they haven't kept enough distance. These animals are big, wild and potentially dangerous, so give them the space they need.
In addition, you must be aware that the smell attracts bears and other animals, so you should avoid bringing or cooking food that smells, and the clay must be kept clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa, located on the island of Upolu and has a population of just under 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
In 1889 a special situation arose at the port, as seven ships from Germany, the United States and Great Britain refused to leave.
All ships were sunk, except one British warship, and nearly 200 American and German lives were lost.
Under the independence struggle organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful gathering in the city led to the assassination of its leader, Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
As Auckland is situated between two harbours, it has many beaches, the most popular of which are located in three areas.
The North Harbour district's northern coastline is the Pacific Ocean, stretching from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Almost all of them are sandy beaches with safe conditions for swimming, and most of them also have shade from the Pohutukawa-tre.
Tamaki Drive beaches are located at Waitemata Harbour, in the exclusive suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers in central Auckland.
These are sometimes crowded family beaches with a good selection of boutiques along the coast.
The local beer is called Number One and is not a complex beer, but is good and refreshing.
There are many French wines to be had, but New Zealand and Australian wines would probably be a better choice.
Tap water is perfectly safe to drink, but bottled water is easy to get if you want to be on the safe side.
A flat white will be distant for an Australian, a small black coffee is an espresso, a cappuccino is served with a mass of cream puffs, and tea is served without milk.
The hot chocolate is a Belgian standard, but the fruit juices are expensive, but they're good.
Many tours are organized throughout the year, and damage to the reef is rare.
It is nevertheless advisable to follow the advice of the authorities and to follow all signs and warnings.
Cubic meters are found near beaches and river mouths from October to April north of the small town of 1770.
There are sharks, but they rarely attack humans, and most sharks are afraid of humans and swim away.
The saltwater crocodile does not live actively in the ocean, but its primary habitat is in river mouths north of Rockhampton.
By booking in advance, travellers can be sure that they have a place to sleep when they arrive at their destination.
Travel agencies often have agreements with specific hotels, but it may be possible to book other forms of accommodation, for example at a camping site, through a travel agency.
Travel agencies usually offer packages that include breakfast and transportation to and from the airport, and sometimes combined flight and hotel packages.
It is also possible to keep the reservation if you need time to think about the offer or arrange other documents for the destination (e.g. visa).
Any changes or requests should be sent to the travel agency first, not directly to the hotel.
At some music festivals, most participants choose to clay the festival, and most participants consider this an important part of the experience.
If you want to be close to what's happening, you have to get there early to get a tent near the music.
Note that although the music on the main stage has ended, there may be other places on the festival where music is played late into the night.
Some festivals have their own camping areas for families with small children.
If you're going to cross the Baltic Sea in winter, check the location of the cabin, some people will hear it especially well when the ship is passing through the ice, it's very noisy.
A cruise to St. Petersburg will give you a little time in the city, and cruise passengers do not need a visa (check the conditions).
Casinos make sure that their guests spend as much time and money as possible in the casino.
Special prices are often offered for food, drinks and entertainment to keep the mood up.
Some places offer free drinks with alcohol, but it is known that intoxication weakens the judgment, and every good gambler knows the importance of staying sober.
Anyone who is to drive on higher latitudes or over mountain passes must know that they may encounter snow, ice or cold.
On icy and snowy roads, friction is low, and you cannot drive in the same way as on bare asphalt.
During a snowstorm, so much snow can fall in a short time that you can get stuck.
The visibility may also be impaired by snow falling or snow on the route, or when snow is falling or ice is forming on car winds.
On the other hand, icy and snowy conditions are common in many countries, and traffic runs virtually uninterrupted all year.
Safari is perhaps the biggest tourist attraction in Africa and the highlight of many visitors.
In popular usage, the term safari refers to trips on land to see the fantastic African wildlife, especially the savanna.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to walk near cars, and standard equipment will provide good visibility.
Lions, cheetahs and leopards are sometimes a bit shy, and you'll see them better with binoculars.
A hiking safari (also called a bush walk, hiking safari, or footing safari) is a series of hikes that can last from a few hours to several days.
The Paralympics will be held from August 24 to September 5, 2021, with several events scheduled to be held in other locations in Japan.
Tokyo is the only Asian city to host two Summer Olympics, as it hosted the 1964 Games.
If you booked flights and accommodation for 2020 before the games were postponed, it might get difficult.
The rules for cancellation vary, but as of the end of March, most of the coronavirus-based cancellation rules will not apply until July 2020, when the Olympics were scheduled.
It is expected that most tickets will cost between 2500 JPY and 130 000 JPY, with the most common tickets costing around 7000 JPY.
Wet clothes can be dried by being ironed. Many hotels have ironing boards and ironing irons for rent, although these are not always available in the room.
If you can't borrow an iron, or if you don't want to wear stroked socks, you can try using a hair dryer.
Be careful not to overheat the material (which can cause it to shrink or, in the worst case, cause it to sink).
There are different ways to purify water, and some are more effective against specific threats.
In some areas, the water boils for one minute, while in others it boils for several minutes.
Filter efficiency varies, and if you don't feel completely confident, consider buying bottled water with a seal from a reputable company.
Travelers may encounter pests they are not familiar with at home.
Pests can damage food, cause irritation, or in the worst case cause allergic reactions, spread poison, or transmit infections.
Infectious diseases, or dangerous animals that can harm or kill humans by force, do not normally qualify as pests.
In a duty-free market, goods can be purchased free of duty and tax at certain points.
Travelers to countries with high taxes can sometimes save a lot of money, especially on products such as alcohol and tobacco.
The stretch between Point Marion and Fairmont offers very challenging driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Highway, and one must often drive through the open woods.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, you must keep your head cool when you encounter steep climbs, narrow roads and sharp turns, which are typical for this stretch.
The speed limits are noticeably lower than earlier and later road sections, usually 5664 km/h (3540 mph), and it is even more important than otherwise to follow these.
Strangely enough, the mobile coverage is much better here than on many other lines along the route, such as Pennsylvania Wilds.
German bakeries are quite good, and in Bayern they are quite powerful and varied, as well as in their southern neighbour, Austria.
Baked goods with fruit are common, with apples added to the baked goods all year round, while cherries and plums are used in summer.
Many German bakery products also contain almonds, hazelnuts and other nuts, and a cup of strong coffee is often a good addition to such popular cakes.
If you want a small but powerful pastry, you can try what, depending on the area you are in, is called Berliner, Pfannkuchen or Krapfen.
Curry dishes are based on herbs and spices that are mixed with either meat or vegetables.
