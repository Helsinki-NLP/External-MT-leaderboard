Not only does this confirm that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, which is a theory that already exists, but it also provides details like color and three-dimensional arrangement that fossils generally cannot.
Scientists say that the animal's feathers are pale or carotenoid in color on the lower half of the body and chestnut-brown on the upper half.
The discovery also provides insights into the evolution of feathers in birds.
Since dinosaur feathers did not have a well-developed feather stalk called a bird's feather stalk but had other feather features, such as hooks and pegs, the researchers concluded that the bird's feather stalk was probably an evolutionary development that came after these features.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used for flight, but rather for temperature regulation and imaging purposes, and the researchers say that although this was the tail of a young dinosaur, the specimen showed adult hair, not juvenile hair.
Although this is the tail of a juvenile dinosaur, the researchers claimed that it indicated adult feathers, not, for example, a chick's.
A car bomb exploded in the police headquarters in Gaziantep, Turkey yesterday morning, killing two police officers and injuring more than twenty.

The work was largely theoretical, but the program was written to simulate observations of the Sagittarius galaxy.
The effect the team was looking for would be caused by tidal forces between the galaxy's dark matter and the Milky Way's dark matter.
Just as the moon pulls the Earth and causes tides, the Milky Way also exerts a force on the Milky Way.
Scientists have been able to determine that dark matter affects other dark matter just like normal matter.
This theory states that much of the dark matter around a galaxy is found in a similar way to the light ring around the galaxy, and is made up of many tiny particles.

Voting in France has traditionally been a low-tech experience: voters sit alone in a booth, putting a pre-printed piece of paper in an envelope, showing the candidate they have chosen.
Once the authorities have confirmed the identity of the voter, the voter places the envelope in the box and signs the voter list.
The French electoral law regulates the process very strictly.
Since 1988, ballot boxes have been transparent, so that voters and observers can confirm that there were no envelopes in the ballot boxes at the beginning of voting, and that no envelopes were added to the boxes, except for those that were thrown by voters who were deemed to be legitimate and approved.
Candidates can send representatives to witness each stage of the process, and in the evening, votes are counted by volunteers under close observation following certain procedures.

The crash site was temporarily closed as emergency responders removed the driver from the red Audi TT.
First, he was removed to James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was later transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya, who was accused of killing his son, has since been in the Edinburgh Sheriff Court.
He's in custody awaiting indictment and trial, but the fact that the photo has been widely published could compromise the credibility of the evidence that witnesses will present.
This is a common practice elsewhere in the United Kingdom, but Scottish courts and tribunals have found the publication of the photographs potentially objectionable.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee says that "journalists seem to be walking a dangerous line when they publish photos of suspects and so on".
The Crown Prosecution Service, which is in charge of the investigation, has told reporters that it will not comment further until at least the indictment is prepared.
The leaked document allegedly refers to a border dispute in which Palestine demands a return to the borders that existed before the 1967 Arab-Israeli War.
Other issues covered include the future state of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both nations, and the Jordan Valley.
Israel demands that the troops be stationed in the valley for ten years after the signing of the agreement, while the Palestinians agree to limit this requirement to only five years.
The hunters participating in the complementary insecticide trial were scheduled to be closely monitored by guards while the experiment was observed and the efficiency was assessed.
The NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc. have teamed up with a team of qualified volunteers from the Sporting Shooting Association's shooting program.
According to Park Conservation Deputy Director Mick O'Flynn and NPWS Legacy, the four hunters selected for the first hunting operation received extensive safety and training.
Martelly was sworn in yesterday by the new nine-member Provisional Electoral Council (CEP).
This will be Martelly's fifth Provisional Electoral Council in four years.
Last month, a presidential commission recommended the CEP's resignation as part of a package of measures to force the country into a new election.
Martelly responded with this commission to the high-profile anti-regime demonstrations that began in October.
The failure to hold the necessary elections has set the stage for sometimes violent protests, some of which have been pending since 2011.
A total of six fires and about 60 cases of iPod overheating were reported, causing minor burns in four people.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) has announced that it is aware of 27 accidents involving devices.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had given them information on 34 new extreme warming events, and that the company had classified these events as "not serious".
The ministry responded by calling Apple's delay in the report "really sad".
The earthquake occurred at 07:19 local time (Friday 09:19 GMT) in Mariana.
The Northern Marianas Emergency Management Office said there were no reported damage in the country.
Also, the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said there was no indication of a tsunami.
A former Filipino policeman has taken Hong Kong tourists hostage by hijacking their bus in the Philippine capital of Manila.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 at the tourists.
At least six people have been confirmed dead so far in the rescue of numerous hostages.
Six hostages, including children and elderly, were released along with the Filipino photographers.
Then the photographers replaced an old woman who had to go to the bathroom.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and embarked on a career in medicine.
She trained as a gynaecologist and began her residency at the Auckland National Hospital for Women in 1959.
While working at the hospital, Liggins began to study premature birth in his spare time.
His research showed that if the hormone was administered, it would accelerate the fetal lung maturation.
Xinhua reported that government investigators recovered two 'black box' flight recorders on Wednesday.
And his fellow wrestlers paid their respects to Luna.
"My first manager, Luna, died in a night two months old, just like her, a very unique, powerful woman".
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels said, "Luna was as strange as I am... maybe even more so... and I love her and I'll miss her... and I hope she's in a better place".
A poll of 1,400 people before the 2010 federal election showed that opposition to Australia becoming a republic had risen by 8 per cent since 2008.
Interim Prime Minister Julia Gillard said during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed that Australia should come to a republican betrayal at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
Thirty-four percent of those polled share this view, and want Queen Elizabeth II to be Australia's last queen.
At the extreme end of the poll, 31 percent believe Australia should never be a republic, while 29 percent of those polled believe Australia should be a republic as soon as possible.
The Olympic gold medallist was due to swim the 100m and 200m freestyle and the triple-flagged Commonwealth Games but due to complaints her fitness is in doubt.
He couldn't get the medication he needed to ease his pain because he was banned from competition.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest prime number known to date on January 25.
In early February, many people using different hardware and software confirmed this discovery, and it was announced on Tuesday.
Comets could be the source of water that brings water to the Earth, along with the organic matter that makes up proteins and could support life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets, especially Earth, formed when comets collided with Earth long ago.
Cuomo, 53, took office earlier this year and signed a bill last month that legalized same-sex marriage.
He described the rumors as "political gibberish and stupidity".
There's speculation that he'll be the presidential nominee in 2016.
NextGen is a system that the FAA says will allow planes to fly shorter routes, save millions of gallons of fuel every year, and reduce carbon emissions.
Airborne uses satellite-based technology, unlike the old ground radar-based technology, to allow air traffic controllers to more accurately detect aircraft and provide more accurate information to pilots.
There will be no extra rides, no overground trains stop at Wembley, no surface parking and no use of the facilities.
The possibility of being forced to play behind closed doors without fans of the team because of the fear of lack of transportation.
A study published Thursday in the journal Science reports the discovery of a new species of bird in the Galapagos Islands of Ecuador.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that the species evolved in only two generations, although it was believed that this process took much longer due to the breeding between an endemic Darwin's spinoch, Geospiza fortes, and a migratory cactus spinoch, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be shaped into any shape, and rolled into small shapes.
It can be made into a thin cable that can be folded and bent, it can be beaten into a sheet or cut into a mold.
It can be made very thin and glued to other metals, so thin that sometimes it's used to decorate hand-painted pictures called "techies" in books.
This is called the pH of a chemical, and you can use the juice of red cabbage to make an indicator.
Cabbage juice changes color depending on how acidic or basic (alkaline) the chemical is.
The pH level is determined by the amount of hydrogen ions (H in pH) in the test chemical.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have lost their electrons because hydrogen atoms are made up of one proton and one electron.
Mix two spoons of dry powder, then shape it into a ball with your clean, wet hands.
It's going to react with the moist outer layers of your hands, and it's going to give you a fun feeling, and it's going to create a kind of shell in your hand.
Nearly every house in Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had a toilet with a drain connected to a sophisticated sewer system.
In Greece, the remains of a sewage system were found in the houses of the cities of Minos on the island of Crete and Santorini.
Ancient Egypt, Iran, and China all had toilets, and in Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of baths, where men and women were mixed together in a mixed company.
When you're looking for someone who lives thousands of miles away, you're using a satellite as a vehicle.
The satellite in space picks up the call and bounces it back almost instantly.
The satellite is launched into space by a rocket, and because the Earth's atmosphere blocks some of our light and vision, scientists use telescopes in space.
To put a satellite or a telescope into space, you need a massive rocket more than 100 feet long.
The wheel has changed the world in incredible ways, and the greatest thing it has done for us is it has made transportation so much easier and faster.
He brought us the train, the car, and many other means of transportation.
In the lower layer of these, there are more moderate cats that eat the prey of the mid-sized animals, from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
Finally, there are many small cats (including free-ranging domestic cats) that eat many small prey such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret of their success is the concept of niche, a special job that each cat has and which prevents them from competing with others.
Lions are the most social of all cats, living in large groups called herds.
A lion herd consists of about thirty adult male relatives, ranging from one to three, along with a female and a cub.
Females are usually closely related to each other and are part of a family of older sisters and daughters.
Lion herds behave very similar to wolf or dog herds, animals that are surprisingly similar to lions (but not other large cats) in behavior, and are also very lethal to their prey.
A versatile athlete, the tiger can climb (though not well), swim, jump great distances, and pull with five times the force of a strong man.
Tigers, along with lions, leopards, and jaguars, are the only four cats that can roar.
The tiger's roar is not the full-voiced roar of a lion, but rather a murmur, a phrase made up of shouting words.
The ocelot loves to eat small animals, and it catches monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds if it can, and almost all the animals that the ocelot hunts have bodies that are much smaller than its own.
Scientists think that the ocelots, other animals, follow and find food by sensing where they are on the ground, by smelling.
With their night vision, they can see very well at night and they can also move very stealthily, and the oselo will integrate with their environment and catch them.
When a small group of organisms (a small population) leaves the population from which they came (for example, if they go behind a ridge or river, or if they go to a new island where it is not easy for them to return), they will often find themselves in a different environment from their previous environment.
This new environment has different resources and different competitors, so the new population will need different characteristics or adaptations to become a stronger competitor than it previously needed.
The original population has not changed, they still need the same adaptations as before.
Over time, as the new population begins to adapt to their new surroundings, they begin to look more and more different from the rest of the population.
Eventually, thousands or even millions of years from now, these two animals will look so different that they will not be considered the same species.
We call this process "mutation", which means the formation of new species, and mutation is an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce the oxygen that humans breathe in and absorb the carbon dioxide that humans exhale (that is, exhale).
Plants get their nutrients from the sun by photosynthesis.
We make our homes from plants and we make our clothes from plants, and most of the food we eat is plant-based, and without plants, animals couldn't survive.
The Mosaurus was the top predator of its day, so it was afraid of nothing but other mosaurians.
Its long jaws were filled with more than 70 razor-sharp teeth, along with an extra set of teeth at the top of its mouth, which meant there was no escape for anything that crossed its path.
We don't know for sure, but maybe it had a forked tongue, and it ate turtles and large fish and other mosasaurs, and maybe it ate its own kind.
It also attacked anything that entered the water, and even a giant dinosaur like a T. rex was no match for it.
While we are familiar with much of their food, the Romans took their share of unusual or unusual feast items, such as wild boar, peacock, snail, and a type of rodent called the nut mouse.
Another difference was that the poor and women liked to sit in chairs and eat their meals, while the rich men liked to sit side by side and feast.
Ancient Roman cuisine could not have included the foods that would come to Europe from America or Asia in later centuries.
For example, they had no corn, no tomatoes, no potatoes, no cocoa, and no ancient Roman turkey meat.
The Babylonians built a primary temple to each god, which was considered the house of that god.
People offered sacrifices to the gods, and the priests tried to satisfy the gods' needs with rituals and festivals.
Each temple has an open temple courtyard and then an inner sanctuary, which only priests can enter.
Special pyramidal towers, sometimes called ziggurats, were built as part of temples.
The top of the tower was a special temple for the god.
In the hot climate of the Middle East, the house was not so important.
Most of the Hebrew family's life was spent outdoors.
Women cooked in the garden, shops were just open stalls facing the street, and stone was used to build houses.
The land of Canaan was devoid of large forests, so the cost of wood was prohibitive.
Greenland is sparsely settled, and Scandinavian legends tell of Erik the Red being banished from Iceland for murder, and travelling west, finding Greenland and naming it Greenland.
But despite his discovery, the Eskimo tribes were already living there at the time.
Although each country was 'Scandinavian', there were many differences between the people, kings, customs and histories of Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland.
If you've seen the movie National Treasure, you might think that there's a treasure map drawn on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
But it's not true, and although there's something written on the back of the document, it's not a treasure map.
The back of the Declaration of Independence was inscribed "Original Declaration of Independence, July 4, 1776", the text appearing upside down at the bottom of the document.
Although no one knows for sure who wrote it, it is known that early in his life the large parchment roll (293⁄4 inches by 241⁄2 inches) was wrapped for concealment.
So it's likely that the information will be added in a simple way, as a label.
The Normandy Expedition and subsequent wars liberated the north of France, but the south was still occupied.
It was ruled by the Vichy French, who were the French who made peace with the Germans in 1940 and worked with the occupiers instead of fighting them.
On 15 August 1940, the Allies invaded southern France, the name "Operation Dragoon" was used for the invasion.
In just two weeks, American and Free French forces liberated southern France and moved on to Germany.
Civilization is a singular culture shared by a substantially larger group of people, a community, who live and work together.
The word civilization comes from the Latin civilis, meaning 'civil', and is related to the Latin civis, meaning 'citizen', and the Latin civitas, meaning 'city' or 'city-state', and also describes the size of a society.
City states are the precursors of nations, and civilization culture is the transmission of knowledge over several generations, a lasting cultural imprint and a fair distribution.
Small cultures often disappear without leaving any historical evidence of themselves, and are not considered true civilizations.
During the American Revolutionary War, the thirteen colonies established a weak central government under the Confederate Constitution, and Congress was the only component of that government.
Congress had no power to tax, and with no executive or judicial authority at the national level, it relied on state officials, who were often uncooperative, to enforce all its acts.
He had no authority to override tax laws and interstate tariffs.
The amendments required the unanimous consent of all the provinces, and the provinces were so dismissive of the central government that their representatives were often not in office.
Italy's national football team is the second most successful team in the world, along with the German national football team, and were the 2006 FIFA World Cup champions.
Football, basketball, volleyball, softball, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, ice hockey, and F1 motor racing are some of the popular sports.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern regions, and Italians compete in international games and Olympic events.
The Japanese have about 7,000 islands, the largest of which is Honshu, making Japan the seventh largest island on earth!
Because of the island group it has, Japan is often referred to as an "island" geographically.
Taiwan's turning point dates back to a time in the 15th century when European sailors recorded the island's name as Ilha Formosa, or Beautiful Island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company built a plant in southwestern Taiwan, changing the local grain production methods and employing Chinese workers to work in the rice and sugar fields.
In 1683, Qing dynasty (1644-1912) forces took control of the western and northern coastal regions of Taiwan, and in 1885 declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire.
In 1895, following its defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, which ceded sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which would govern the island until 1945.
Macchu Picchu is made up of three main structures known as the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Temple of the Three Windows.
Many of the buildings around the site have been reconstructed to give tourists a better idea of what they looked like in the original.
In 1976, 30 percent of Machu Picchu was restored, and the restoration is still going on today.
For example, the most common still image photography format in the world is 35 mm, which was the dominant film size at the end of the analogue film era.
It's still being produced today, but more importantly, it gets its en-boy ratio from digital camera image sensor formats.
The 35mm format is actually 36mm wide and 24mm tall, which is a bit confusing.
The aspect ratio of this format (the simplest integer ratio is divided by twelve) is therefore said to be 3:2.
Many common formats (e.g. the APS family of formats) are equal to or very close to this en-size ratio.
The oft-overused and often-neglected rule of thirds is a simple rule that creates dynamism in a photograph while maintaining proportion.
It states that the most effective area for the main subject is the point of convergence of the lines that divide the image longitudinally and horizontally into three (see example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become wealthy and powerful, was controlled.
For more than a millennium, Christianity had held the nations of Europe together despite their differences in language and customs.
His all-pervasive power has affected everyone from the king to the crown prince.
One of the most important beliefs of Christianity is the use of wealth to alleviate suffering and poverty, and the church's capital is used specifically for this purpose.
The centrality of power and money in Rome, where the church had been for more than a thousand years, led many to question whether the church had acted according to this principle.
Immediately after the war began, Britain imposed a naval blockade on Germany.
This siege, although it violates international law, which has been accepted as general law in many international treaties over the past two centuries, has been strategically effective and has prevented the delivery of vital military and civilian supplies.
Britain has threatened even neutral ships by laying mines in international waters to prevent any vessel from entering the entire ocean.
As this tactic was met with limited response, Germany expected a response similar to the submarine warfare that had been unleashed.
In the 1920s, the prevailing attitude of most citizens and the nation was one of pacifism and isolationism.
In World War I, nations that had experienced the horrors and atrocities of war wanted to avoid facing such a situation again in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to accept a job with the Edison Company, based in New York City.
He came to the U.S. with four cents, a book of poetry, and a letter of reference from Charles Batchelor, his former manager, to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of showing different periods of time; each period of China or each ruling family was a separate dynasty.
There was also an unstable period of territory divided between each dynasty, most famously the Three Kingdoms period, which lasted 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During this period, there were fierce battles between many nobles vying for the throne.
During the Three Kingdoms period, one of the bloodiest periods in ancient Chinese history, thousands died fighting for the highest position in the great court of Xi'an.
There are many social and political influences, such as the use of the metric system, the transition from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism, and the belief that the country belongs to the people, not to a single ruler.
Again, after the Revolution, the professions were open to all male candidates, ensuring that the most ambitious and successful would win.
The same is true for the army because the army ranks are now based on Cailaber, not on class.
The French Revolution inspired many working-class people in other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was deeply interested in matters beyond this ordinary life, and often went to a cave on the Mount of Light, later called the Hira, to meditate.
The cave itself, which dates from that time, provides a very clear picture of Muhammad's spiritual inclination.
Located on top of a mountain north of Mecca, the cave is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, even if it's known to exist, it's not easy to find, and it's completely isolated inside the cave.
Nothing is visible except the clear, beautiful sky above us and the surrounding mountains, and very little of this world can be seen or heard from inside the cave.
The Great Pyramid at Giza is the only one of the seven wonders of the world still standing today.
The Great Pyramid, built by the Egyptians in the third century B.C., is one of many great pyramids built to honor deceased pharaohs.
The Giza Plateau or "Necropolis of Giza" in the Egyptian Valley of the Dead contains several pyramids (the Great Pyramid being the largest), several smaller tombs, several temples, and the great Sphinx.
The magnificent pyramid was built to honour the Pharaoh Khufu, and much of the smaller pyramids, tombs and temples were built to honour Khufu's wives and family heiresses.
The upper bow mark is a V-shape and the "lower bow mark" looks like a plaster or a missing square below.
It means that you have to start from the top and push the bow, and from the bottom, you have to pull the bow from the stem.
The upper bow generally produces a softer sound, while the lower bow is stronger and sharper.
Feel free to make your own markings with the pencil, but remember that the bow-pull markings are there for a musical reason, so you usually have to follow them.
The terrified King Louis XVI, his two young children, 11-year-old Marie Therese and four-year-old Louis-Charles, Queen Marie Antoinette and the King's sister Madam Elizabeth were forcibly deported from Versailles to Paris on 6 October 1789 by a large group of women.
They're back in a car in Paris, surrounded by a mob of people who are yelling and threatening the King and Queen.
The human crowd forced the King and Queen to open the carriage windows.
At one point, one of the crowd shook the head of a royal guard who had been murdered in Versailles in front of the frightened Queen.
The war expenses incurred by US imperialism to conquer the Philippines were paid by the Filipino people themselves.
They had to pay taxes to the US colonial regime to cover a large part of the interest and expenses of the bonds that were held on behalf of the Philippine government through Wall Street banks.
Undoubtedly, the extra profit from the long years of exploitation of the Filipino people is among the main gains of US imperialism.
To understand the Templars, one must understand the circumstances that led to the creation of the sect.
The period in which the events occurred is often referred to as the High Middle Ages, which is the time span of the 11th, 12th and 13th centuries in European history (1000-13000 AD).
The High Middle Ages preceded the Early Middle Ages and were followed by the Late Middle Ages around 1500, when the agreement ended.
Technological determinism is a term that covers a very wide range of ideas in practice, including views such as the technological drive or the inevitability of technology, which holds that human destiny is determined by scientific laws in the subconscious and by a logic associated with the application of these laws in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general ideas: that the development of technology itself largely follows a path beyond cultural or political influence, and that technology also has some "impacts" on societies that are internal rather than socially conditioned.
For example, one might say that the motor car was a necessary precursor to the development of roads.
But having a nationwide road infrastructure is not economically feasible if there are fewer vehicles, so new production methods are being developed to reduce the cost of owning a vehicle.
Mass car ownership also leads to more accidents on the roads, which leads to new techniques in the health sector for repairing injured bodies.
Romanticism was characterized by a broad cultural determinism that passed through writers like Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography shaped people, and over time, traditions and culture related to that geography emerged that were more in tune with where the society was and were better than arbitrarily imposed laws.
Just as Paris was considered the fashion capital of the modern world, so Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
It gained a reputation as a center of luxury about 400 C.E., and it maintained that reputation until about 1100 C.E.
It declined in status by the twelfth century, as the Crusaders returned with gifts such as silks and spices, which were valued far more than those offered by the Byzantine markets.
The fashion capital has been moved from Constantinople to Paris in recent years.
The Gothic style reached its peak between the 10th and 11th centuries and in the 14th century.
Initially, clothing was heavily influenced by Byzantine culture in the east.
However, due to the slowness of the communication channels, the western styles were 25 to 30 years behind.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to form its own style, and one of the great advances of the period, with the end of the Crusades, was the use of buttons to tie the clothes of the common people.
Subsistence farming is farming that produces enough food to meet the needs of the farmer and his family.
Subsistence farming is a simple and mostly organic system where protected seeds specific to the ecological zone and crop rotation or other relatively simple methods are used to obtain the maximum yield.
Historically, most farmers were subsistence farmers, and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together like-minded people who feel excluded by societal norms and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures may be distinctive because of the age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender of their members.
The qualities that distinguish a subculture individually may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or a combination of various factors.
Members of a subculture express their identity as part of that culture by using a distinct and symbolic style, often involving fashion, attitude, and slang.
One of the most common ways to demonstrate the importance of socialization is to point out a few unfortunate incidents involving children who were socialized by adults who neglected, unwittingly or intentionally abused them while growing up.
Some feral children are confined by humans (mostly their own parents) to confined spaces, and in some cases, abandonment of children has been due to the parents' rejection of a child's serious mental or physical disability.
Wild children may have been exposed to severe child abuse or trauma before they were abandoned or escaped.
Others are claimed to have been raised by animals, and some are said to live on their own in the wild.
When raised entirely by animals, feral children exhibit behaviors that are almost entirely those of the animal that raised them, such as fear of humans or insensitivity to humans (as far as physical limitations allow).
Project-based learning makes learning easy and engaging, while mentoring goes one step further.
Orientation support is not a learning method but a support to individuals experiencing a new learning experience such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
The referral support can be both virtual and real, in other words, a teacher is a referral but so is the little attaché in Microsoft Office.
Virtual scaffolds are embedded in software and are meant to interrogate, guide and explain procedures that the student may find challenging to handle on their own.
Children are placed in foster care for a variety of reasons, from neglect to abuse to even rape.
No child should grow up in a place that lacks protection, affection and education, but unfortunately, that is not the case.
We see the Protective Family System as a safe zone for these children.
Our expectations of our foster care system are safe homes, loving caregivers, stable education, and reliable health care.
Child welfare is obliged to meet all requirements that were not previously met in the host home.
The Internet combines elements of both mass communication and interpersonal communication.
The distinctive features of the Internet add an extra dimension to the approach to use and satisfaction.
For example, learning and socialization are recommended as important motivations for Internet use (James et al., 1995).
When investigating audience responses to websites, personal engagement and enhanced relationships were also identified as new incentives by Eighmey and McCord (1998).
The use of video images has led to important discoveries in the interpretation of facial expressions, which last for several milliseconds.
It is suggested that a method of correctly interpreting microexpressions in particular can be used to detect whether a person is lying.
Oliver Sacks, in his article called The President's Speech, noted that people who have trouble perceiving speech properly due to brain damage can still accurately assess sincerity.
He even claims that pets, like dogs, may have these same abilities to interpret human behavior.
Research in the 20th century has shown that there are two different pools of genetic variation: hidden and expressed.
Mutation creates new genetic differentiation, and selection removes it from the pool of differentiation that it expresses.
In each generation, the separation and re-merging of the two pools mixes the variation back and forth.
In the savannah, a primate with a digestive system similar to that of humans would have difficulty meeting its amino acid requirements from available plant sources.
Moreover, failure to do so has serious consequences, including growth depression, malnutrition, and eventual death.
The easiest plant sources to access would be proteins from leaves and beans, but plants are not likely to be digested by primates like us without being cooked.
In contrast, animal foods (ant, termites, eggs) are not only easily digestible but also provide high amounts of protein containing all the essential amino acids.
All things considered, it should come as no surprise that our ancestors solved the "protein problem" in much the same way that chimpanzees do today in the savanna.
Sleep disruption is the process of consciously awakening during normal sleep and then falling back to sleep after a short period of time (about 10 to 60 minutes).
This can be done quite easily by using a relatively quieter alarm clock to keep your consciousness open without waking you completely from your sleep.
If you find yourself setting the alarm again in your sleep, the clock can be placed on the other side of the room, forcing you to get out of bed to turn off the alarm.
Other biorhythm-based options include drinking too much fluid (especially water or tea, a known diuretic) before sleep, and forcing someone to urinate.
The amount of inner peace that a person has is inversely related to the amount of tension in his body and soul.
The less stress, the more positive the life force is, and every human being has the potential to find absolute peace and contentment.
Everyone can achieve enlightenment, and the only thing standing in the way of that is our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is a teaching based on the teachings of the Buddha, but extended by the mahayana love path and many techniques taken from Indian Yoga.
Tibetan Buddhism is very simple in principle, it's a combination of Kundalini Yoga, meditation and a path of love that embraces everything.
Kundalini Yoga, through Yoga poses, breathing exercises, mantras and visualizations, is the awakening of the Kundalini energy (energy of enlightenment).
The center of Tibetan meditation is the God Yoga, where the visualization of various gods cleanses energy channels, activates chakras, and creates enlightened consciousness.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, and this led to cooperation between the USSR and the U.S. At the end of the war, system, process and cultural conflicts divided the countries.
Two years after the war ended, the old allies were now enemies, and the Cold War began.
It was going to be fought by proxy armies for the next 40 years in the war zones from Africa to Asia, Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places.
By September 17th, 1939, the Polish defense had already been dispersed, and the only hope was to retreat and reorganize along the Romanian bridgehead.
But these plans were rendered invalid almost overnight when more than 800,000 Soviet Red Army troops invaded Poland's eastern territories and invaded the White Russian and Ukrainian fronts, violating the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact and other international agreements, both bilateral and multilateral.
The use of ships to transport goods is by far the most efficient way of transporting large quantities of people and goods across the oceans.
The Navy's mission has traditionally been to protect the transportation capacity of your country, your people and your goods, and to interfere with the enemy's transportation capacity.
One of the most notable contemporary examples of this was the North Atlantic front of World War II, where the Americans were trying to transport troops and equipment across the Atlantic Ocean to deliver aid to Britain.
Meanwhile, the German Navy, using mostly U-boats, was trying to stop this traffic.
If the Allies had failed, Germany would have probably taken over Britain as well as the rest of Europe.
Goats are estimated to have been domesticated for the first time about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to feed them milk, wool, meat and mail for easy access.
Domesticated goats were often kept in flocks roaming on hillsides or other pasturelands, often herded by goat herders who were children or adolescents, similar to the more commonly known herders.
Wagon roads were not built in England until the 16th century.
Although the wagon tracks were only parallel wooden pallets, they allowed the horses pulling them to reach higher speeds and to pull larger loads than the slightly more rugged tracks of the day.
Travers were used to hold rails in place at a very early date, but over time it was discovered that rails could be more efficient when there was an iron band on top.
This became a common practice, but caused more wear on the wooden wheels of the iron carriages.
As a result, wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels. In 1767, the first all-iron rails were put into service.
The first known mode of transport was walking, and humans started walking upright two million years ago with the appearance of Homo erectus, which means upright man.
The previous generation of Australopithecus could not walk on two legs normally.
The first known use of two feet is in Australopithecus fossils from 4.2-3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have walked on two feet as early as seven million years ago.
We can start to live more environmentally consciously, join the environmental movement, even become activists to reduce the problems of the future a little bit.
This is like symptomatic treatment in most cases, but if we want to get to the root of the problem and neutralize it, we need to get to the root of the problem.
It is clear that the world has changed so much because of man's scientific and technological advances, and the problems have been made worse by overpopulation and man's wasteful way of life.
After its adoption by Congress on July 4, the manuscript, signed by Congress President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson, was sent to John Dunlap's print shop a few blocks away.
The pamphlets, now known as the Dunlap Broadsides, were printed in 150 to 200 copies in one night.
The first public reading of the document was by John Nixon on July 8 in the courtyard of Independence Hall.
One of these documents was sent to George Washington on July 6 to be read by his troops in New York on July 9, and a copy arrived in London on August 10.
The earliest known copies of the document are the 25 Dunlap pamphlets, of which no original handwritten version has survived.
Most paleontologists today believe that a group of dinosaurs survived and are alive today, and we call them birds.
Most people don't think of them as dinosaurs because of their feathers and their ability to fly.
But there are still many things about birds that look like dinosaurs.
They have furry feet and claws, and they lay eggs and walk on two hind legs like a T-Rex.
Almost all computers in use today rely on the misuse of information encoded in binary form.
A binary number can have only one of the values 0 and 1, which in the field of information technology are called bits.
Internal intoxication may not be immediately apparent, symptoms like vomiting are too general to be immediately diagnosed.
The most common sign of indoor poisoning is the presence of an open medicine bottle or toxic household chemicals.
Check the label for specific first aid instructions for the poison in question.
The term bug is used formally by entomologists for this species of insect.
The term is derived from its ancient similarities with the bed bug, which has adapted to establish a parasitic relationship with humans.
Both the Killer Bug and the Woodpecker are nest-dwelling animals that have adapted to living in their nests or homes.
There are approximately 400,000 known cases of Multiple Sclerosis (MS) in the United States, which means that the most common neurological disease in younger and middle-aged adults is Multiple Sclerosis (MS).
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which is made up of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerves.
Studies have shown that women are twice as likely to develop MS as men.
A couple may decide that having children is not in their best interests or in the best interests of the child.
These couples may choose to make an adoption plan for their baby.
When adoption is being processed, the biological parents terminate parental rights so that the child's family can be another couple.
The fundamental purpose of science is to discover how the world works by the scientific method, which is actually the direction of most scientific research.
But experiments are not alone. Experiments are tests used to rule out one or more possible hypotheses, ask questions, and observe guidelines for scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on the classical texts, especially the Latin Bible.
He accepted Aristotle's views on all scientific subjects, including the science of the soul.
As Greek science declined, the West broke away from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many rhythms observed in physiology and movement are largely dependent on the existence of internal cycles and the production of these cycles through biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms that are not responsive to external periodic cues have been documented in most living things, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators, maintaining a free-circulation period even in the absence of external signals.
The Hershey and Chase experiment was one of the leading proposals that DNA was genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages and viruses to implant their own DNA into a bacterium.
They did two experiments, labeling the DNA in either radioactive phosphate phage or radioactive sulfur protein phage.
Mutations can have many different effects depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the piece of genetic material affected, and whether the affected cells are germline cells.
Mutations in germline cells alone can affect children, while mutations in other regions can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism attracts people interested in visiting natural areas to enjoy the scenery, including plant and animal wildlife.
Examples of activities on site include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, visiting parks and studying information about the ecosystem.
Another example is to visit, photograph, and learn about the orangutans of Borneo.
Every morning, people leave small country towns in cars to go to work, passing by other workers who are going to the same place they just left to go to work.
In these dynamic inter-transport journeys, everyone is somehow connected to and supports a transportation system based on private cars.
Science shows that this giant carbon economy has disrupted the stable state of the biosphere that has supported human evolution for the past two million years.
Everyone is part of society and uses the transportation system, and almost everyone complains about the transportation system.
You rarely hear about the same level of complaints in developed countries, like water quality or collapsed bridges.
Why do transportation systems get so many complaints, why do they fail on a daily basis, are transportation engineers incompetent, or is there something more fundamental?
Traffic flow is the study of the movements of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and their interactions with each other.
Unfortunately, it's hard to work on traffic flow because driver behavior can't be predicted with 100% accuracy.
Fortunately, drivers tend to behave in a reasonably stable range, so traffic flows tend to have an acceptable consistency and can be roughly described mathematically.
To better represent the traffic flow, relationships between three main characteristics are identified: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These relationships help plan, design and operate railway facilities.
The first animals to fly were insects, and their ability to fly helped them escape their enemies more easily, and find food and mates more easily with less effort.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings backwards along their bodies.
This gives them a wider and smaller range to hide from predators.
Today, the only insect species that cannot fold their wings backwards are the hummingbirds and the mayfly.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system revolved around the sun.
Some people thought he was right, but many people believed the opposite, that the solar system, including the sun (and even other stars), revolved around the earth.
That seems reasonable, because it doesn't feel like the Earth is moving, does it?
The Amazon River is the longest and second largest river on earth, carrying more than eight times the second largest river.
The Amazon, at over six miles wide, is also the largest river on earth.
Exactly 20 percent of the water that flows from the planet's rivers into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The main stem of the Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 mi) long, and it collects water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although the stone pyramid was built by the end of the Old Kingdom, the pyramids of Giza were never surpassed in terms of their size and technical perfection of their structure.
The ancient Egyptians in the New Kingdom looked with wonder at the monuments left by their predecessors, which were at that time more than a thousand years old.
With a population of about 800, the Vatican is the smallest independent country in the world and the least populated.
The Vatican uses Italian in its legislation and in its official communications.
Italian is the everyday language spoken by most of the state's employees, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of Vatican City are Catholic.
Since the earliest times, humans have had knowledge of basic chemical elements such as gold, silver and copper, since all of them can be discovered in nature in their original forms and extracted with relatively simple means.
Aristotle, a philosopher, theorized that everything was made up of a mixture of one or more of the four elements: earth, water, air, and fire.
It's more like the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas and plasma, but it also theorized that they transform into new substances to take the forms we see.
Alloy is basically a mixture of two or more metals, and remember, there are many elements on the periodic table.
Elements like calcium and potassium are considered metals, and of course there are metals like silver and gold.
There are also alloys that contain small amounts of amethylated elements, such as carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter, each matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly small that trillions of them could fit into the period at the end of this sentence.
So, in short, when lead pencils first came out, they were a good friend to a lot of people.
Unfortunately, as new ways of writing came into existence, the pen's use and frequency declined.
People can now type messages from computer screens without ever having to go near a pencil.
Who knows what the keyboard will be like when something new comes out?
A fusion bomb works by taking energy to bring together an atomic nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
In a way, it's like taking a wheelbarrow up a hill, and the core is then recharged and then some of that energy is released.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, meaning they can be broken apart with little or no intervention.
The surface of the moon is made up of rock and dust, and the outer layer of the moon is called the crust.
The earth's crust is about 70 kilometers thick on the near side and 100 kilometers thick on the far side.
It's thinner underneath the Maria, thicker in the highlands.
Since the shell is thinner, there could be more maria on the side, so it was easier for the lava to rise to the surface.
Content theories focus on finding things that trigger or attract people.
These theses reveal that as individuals mature into adulthood, they have certain internalized needs and/or desires.
These theories deal with what causes some people to desire the things they do, and what causes things around them to do or not do certain things to them.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs theory and Hertzberg's Two Factor theory.
In general, managers may be two-faced when they start to dismiss and manage their former colleagues. One aspect of the dilemma is trying to remain "one of the guys" (or one of the girls).
These types of managers have difficulty making decisions that are not in the majority's favor, taking disciplinary action, evaluating performance, assigning responsibility, and holding people accountable.
At the other end of the spectrum, the individual becomes an unrecognizable individual who changes everything the team does and thinks he should do it himself.
After all, the leader is ultimately responsible for the team's success or failure.
This behavior often causes friction between the leader and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams are held to the same standards of excellence as conventional teams, but there are subtle differences.
Virtual team members often act as referrals for their close physical groups.
Because virtual teams can meet at varying times that may not be understood by their local management, they often have more autonomy than traditional team members.
The existence of a real invisible team (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p.109) is also a unique component of a virtual team.
The invisible team is the management team, where each member reports to the other, and the invisible team sets the standards for each member.
Why would an organization want to go through the time-consuming process of establishing a learning organization?
Creativity and mastery can emerge when all possible resources are used effectively in the functional departments of an organization.
As a result, an organization's process of working together to overcome a hurdle can pioneer a new innovative process that will serve the needs of customers.
To be innovative, an organisation must create a culture of innovation, as well as encouraging leadership, knowledge sharing and in-house training.
Melek (2006) describes the Sustainability approach, a method used to help organizations achieve a higher level of performance.
Neurobiological data provide physical evidence for a theoretical approach to the study of cognition, thus narrowing the field of research and making it much more precise.
The link between brain pathology and behavior supports scientists in their research.
It has long been known that different types of brain damage, trauma, lesions and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in some mental functions.
The emergence of new technologies is allowing us to see and study brain structures and processes that we've never seen before.
This gives us a lot of information and material support to design simulation models that help us figure out how our mind works.
While AI has a strong resemblance to science fiction, AI constitutes a very important branch of computer science that deals with behavior, learning, and intelligent adaptation in a machine.
AI research involves developing robots that can automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include control, planning and programming, responding to customer diagnoses and questions; handwriting; voice and facial recognition skills.
Each of these skills has become a separate discipline focused on providing solutions to real-life problems.
AI systems are now being used in economics, medicine, engineering, and military applications as well as in home computers and video game software.
School trips are an important part of all classes, and teachers often love to take their students to places where a bus ride is not possible.
Technology provides the solution by offering a virtual tour, where students can explore the structures in a museum, visit an aquarium, or be enchanted by beautiful works of art while sitting in a classroom.
Sharing a school trip online is a great way to share thoughts and experiences about the trip with other classes.
For example, students from the Bennett School in North Carolina design a website about their trips to the State Capitol each year, the website is re-edited each year, but older versions are kept online for use as a notebook.
Blogs can also help students improve their writing, and while students often begin their blogging experience with sloppy grammar and spelling mistakes, the presence of a readership often changes this.
Since the most critical audience is usually students, bloggers try to improve their writing to avoid criticism.
Blogging "forces students to become more aware of the world around them".[22] The need for followers to nurture their interest inspires students to be intelligent and engaging (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that opens doors to collaboration and encourages students to take learning beyond the traditional school curriculum.
Appropriate use of blogs "may enable students to be more analytical and critical; students may actively react to online materials to determine their own position in the context of others' writings and their own point of view on certain issues" (Oravec, 2002).
Canada's charming bilingual capital, Ottawa, has many art galleries and museums that showcase Canada's past and present.
Further south are Niagara Falls, and to the north, Muskoka and beyond, home to untouched natural beauty.
All of this and more underlines the fact that Ontario is being labeled by outsiders as a self-righteous Canadian.
The vast areas to the north are fairly sparsely populated and some are almost deserted wilderness.
To give you a population comparison that surprises most people: there are more African Americans in the United States than Canadians.
The East African Islands are located in the Indian Ocean, off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest of the islands and is a continent in itself when it comes to wildlife.
Many of the smaller islands are independent nations or dependencies of France, and are known as luxury beach resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam to these lands and it became very widespread in the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonization began in the 15th century, with the discovery of the Cape Route from Europe to India by Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama.
The region is bounded by the Sahel to the north and by the Atlantic Ocean to the south and west.
Women: It is recommended that every female traveler, regardless of actual civility, declare that they are married.
You may also find it helpful to wear a ring (not a very expensive-looking one).
Women should be aware that cultural differences can result in things they would consider harassment, and that it is not unusual to be followed, held in the arms, etc.
Be firm and not afraid to say no when rejecting men (even if there are cultural differences, it doesn't mean it's right!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC and was used by the Phoenicians, Romans and Merenids as a strategic port, called Anfa.
The Portuguese demolished it and rebuilt it as Casa Branca, but abandoned it after an earthquake in 1755.
The sultan of Morocco rebuilt the city as Daru l-Badya and it was later named Casablanca by the Spanish merchants who established trading centers in the city.
If you're looking to do some shopping in Morocco, Casablanca is one of the least appealing places.
Around the old medina, it's easy to find places selling traditional Moroccan products such as tajin, pottery, leather goods, nuts and various trinkets, but these are always for tourists.
Goma is a tourist town in the easternmost part of the Democratic Republic of Congo, near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was devastated by lava from the Nyiragongo volcano, which covered most of the city's streets, especially the city center.
Even if Goma is reasonably safe, all visits from outside Goma should be investigated in order to understand the state of the ongoing conflict in the North Kivu region.
The city, which has some of the cheapest Mount Gorili viewing routes in Africa, is also a base for those who want to climb Nyiragongo.
To get around Goma, you can use the boda-boda (motorcycle taxi).The normal (local) price is about 500 Congolese Francs for a short distance.
Combined with its relative inaccessibility, "Timbuktu" came to be used as a metaphor for exotic, distant lands.
Today, Timbuktu is a city that attracts tourists with its fame and an airport, but it is a poor city.
In 1990, it was added to the list of World Heritage Sites in Danger due to the threat of desert sands.
The PBS special was one of Henry Louis Gates's most important stops during Wonders of the African World.
The city is in stark contrast to other cities in the country, as it is more influenced by the Arab air than by Africa.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the north-east of South Africa and stretches along the border of Mozambique in the east, Zimbabwe in the north, and the southern border is formed by the Timsah River.
The park covers an area of 19,500 km2 and is divided into 14 different ecoregions, each supporting a different wildlife.
As well as being one of South Africa's most popular attractions, it is also seen as the flagship of the South African National Parks (SANParks).
As with all South African National Parks, there are daily conservation fees and entrance fees for the park.
It may be useful to purchase a Wild Card, which provides access to various parks in South Africa or to all of the South African National Parks.
Hong Kong Island gives its name to the Hong Kong region and is considered by many visitors to be the main focal point.
The buildings that make up the Hong Kong skyline are likened to a sparkling columned graph that rises to even greater prominence with the waters of Victoria Harbour.
For the best view of Hong Kong, leave the island and go to the beach opposite Kowloon.
Much of Hong Kong Island's urban development has been acquired from reclaimed land along its northern coast.
This is where the British colonists took it for themselves, and so if you're looking for evidence of the region's colonial past, this is a good place to start.
Stretching some 80 km from the coast to the interior of Bangladesh and India, the Sundarbans is the world's largest belt of coastal mangroves.
Sundarban has been declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO. The remaining part of the forest within the borders of India is called Sundarban National Park.
But the forests are not just mangrove swamps - they also include the last remnants of the great forests that once covered the Ganges plain.
The Sundarbans covers an area of 3,850 km2, about one-third of which is wetland/marshland.
The Sundarbans has been a wildlife sanctuary since 1966 and is now thought to have 400 Royal Bengal tigers and about 30,000 spotted deer.
Buses depart from the inter-regional bus stop (across the river) throughout the day, but mostly, especially those going east and Jakar/Bumthang, depart between 06:30 and 07:30.
It is advisable to buy tickets a few days in advance, as inter-regional buses are often full.
Most of the neighborhoods are served by small Japanese vans, which are comfortable and sturdy.
Shared taxis are a speedy and comfortable means of getting to nearby places like Paro (No. 150) and Punakha (No. 200).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge that spans the Oyapock River connecting the city of Oiapoque in Brazil to the town of Siant-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guinea.
The two towers are 83 meters high, with two lanes of 378 meters long and 3.50 meters wide.
The bridge has a vertical clearance of 15 metres (49 ft). Construction was completed in August 2011, and it was not opened to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is scheduled to be fully operational in September 2017, when the completion of the Brazilian customs checkpoints is expected.
The Guaraní were the most important indigenous group of semi-nomadic hunters and subsistence farmers in the territory of present-day eastern Paraguay.
The Chaco region was home to the Guaycurú, Payaguá, and other indigenous tribes, who subsisted by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
Formerly called the "Great Land of the Indians", Paraguay was formed in the 16th century when Spanish conquistadors encountered indigenous communities.
The Spanish began a three-century colonization period.
Paraguay has managed to largely preserve its indigenous identity and character since the founding of Asunción in 1537.
Argentina is famous for having one of the best polo teams in the world and the best players.
The biggest tournament of the year takes place in December on the polo fields in Las Cañitas.
Smaller tournaments and matches can also be seen here at other times of the year.
For news on where to buy tickets for tournaments and polo matches, see Asociacion Argentina de Polo.
The official currency of the Falklands is the Falklands pound (FKP), which is pegged to a British pound (GBP).
You know, the only bank of the islands in Stanley, across from the FIC West store, has a change of currency.
British pounds are generally accepted throughout the islands, and Stanley credit cards and US dollars are also commonly accepted.
Credit cards will probably not be accepted on remote islands, but Sterling and U.S. dollars may be used.
It's almost impossible to exchange the Falkland Islands pound outside the islands, so change your currency before you leave here.
Montevideo is south of the equator, so it's summer in the northern hemisphere and winter in the southern hemisphere.
Montevideo is in the subtropical climate zone, with temperatures above 30°C common in the summer months.
Winter can be deceptively cold, temperatures rarely fall below freezing, but the combination of wind and humidity can make you feel colder than the thermometer indicates.
There are no distinct seasons that can be described as wet and "dry".
Although most of the animals in the park are used to seeing humans, wildlife is still wild and animals should not be fed or disturbed.
According to park officials, you must stay at least 100 yards away from bears and wolves and 25 yards away from all other wildlife!
No matter how tame they may appear, bison, moose, deer, bears, and almost any other large animal can attack.
Every year, dozens of visitors are injured because they don't keep a proper distance, and these animals are big, wild and potentially dangerous, so give them space.
Also, remember that smells attract bears and other wildlife, so avoid handling or cooking smelly food and keep a clean camp.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. It is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of just under 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
In 1889, seven ships from Germany, the United States, and England refused to leave the harbor, making a show of their hulls, thus giving the port its unfortunate reputation.
All but one British cruiser were sunk, with the loss of about 200 American and German lives.
A peaceful meeting in the town, organized by the Mau movement, resulted in the assassination of Grand Chief Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
Because Auckland is situated between two harbours, there are many beaches, the most popular being three-square.
The North Shore beaches (in the North Harbour area) are on the Pacific Ocean and extend from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Almost all are sandy beaches that are safe for swimming, and most have shade provided by the pohutukawa tree.
Tamaki Drive beaches are located between the Waitemata Harbour, the luxury suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers in Central Auckland.
These are family beaches, sometimes crowded, with a variety of shops lining up along the shore.
The main local beer is 'Number One' which is not a very complex beer but is nice and refreshing and the other local beer is called 'Manta'.
Although there's plenty of French wine to drink, New Zealand and Australian wines might do better.
Local tap water is perfectly safe to drink, but if you're afraid of it, bottled water is easy to find.
The idea of 'flat white' coffee is foreign to Australians. It is a short black 'espresso', cappuccino comes topped with high cream (not topped), and tea is served milkless.
The hot chocolate is Belgian by the standards, the juices are expensive but delicious.
The reef is visited by many trips throughout the year, and for these reasons, reef injuries are very rare.
However, please consult with the appropriate authorities, follow all signs and pay close attention to safety warnings.
The box jellyfish appears from October to April in the north of 1770 near the coasts and near the river estuaries, and can sometimes be seen outside these times.
Sharks do exist, but they rarely attack humans, and most of their sharks are afraid of humans and swim away.
Saltwater crocodiles don't live in the ocean all the time, and their primary habitat is the riverbanks north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance helps travelers to feel comfortable, knowing that they will have a place to sleep when they arrive at their destination.
Travel agencies usually have agreements with specific hotels, but you can also choose other forms of accommodation, such as camping through a travel agency.
Travel agents often offer packages that include breakfast, airport/airport transport arrangements, and even combined flight and hotel packages.
If you need time to think about the offer or to obtain other documents (such as a visa) for your destination, they may put your reservation on hold for you.
Any changes or requests should be sent to the travel agent first, not directly to the hotel.
At some festivals, the vast majority of music festival attendees decide to camp on the festival grounds, and many attendees see this as an important part of the experience.
If you wish to be close to the action, you must go ahead to grab a campground close to the music.
Keep in mind that even if the music is finished on the main stages, there may be parts of the festival that will continue to play music late into the night.
Some festivals have special campgrounds for families with young children.
If you're crossing the North Baltic in the winter, make sure you know where the cabin is, because crossing through the ice makes a terrible noise for the sensitive.
Saint Petersburg cruises include time in the city. Tourist cruise passengers are exempt from visa requirements (check conditions).
Casinos often make a great effort to maximize the amount of time and money that guests spend, and there are often no windows or clocks, and exits can be difficult to find.
To keep the guests in good spirits and to please them, there are usually special food, drink, and entertainment.
Some establishments may offer alcoholic beverages as a treat, but getting drunk can negatively affect your judgment, and all good gamblers know the importance of staying sober.
Anyone who is going to drive a vehicle on high latitudes or mountain passes should consider the possibility of snow, ice, or freezing.
On icy and snowy roads, friction is very low, and you can't drive like you're on dry asphalt.
Snow can fall quickly enough to keep you stuck in the snowstorms.
Vision may also be limited by snow, hail, condensation on vehicle windows, or icing.
On the other hand, icy and snowy weather is common in many countries, and traffic usually flows uninterrupted throughout the year.
Safari is perhaps the biggest tourist attraction in Africa and a highlight for many visitors.
The common usage of the term safari refers to trips made to observe the spectacular African wildlife, especially those that live in the savannah.
Some animals, like elephants and giraffes, tend to get closer to cars, so standard equipment provides good visibility.
Lions, cheetahs and leopards are sometimes shy, and you'll see them better with binoculars.
A walking safari (also called a "nature walk", "nature walking safari", or "walking") is a hike of several hours or days.
The 2021 Summer Olympics will take place from 24 August to 5 September 2021. Some of the events will be held in other locations across Japan.
Tokyo, which hosted the games in 1964, will be the only Asian city to host the Summer Olympics twice.
If you have made your flight and accommodation reservations for 2020 before the announcement of the postponement, you may encounter a difficult situation.
Cancellation policies vary, but as of late March, most coronavirus cancellation policies do not extend until July 2020, when the Olympics are scheduled to be held.
The vast majority of event tickets are expected to cost between ¥2,500 and ¥130,000, with average prices around ¥7,000.
Most hotels have an ironing board and an ironing board that can be borrowed even if you are not in the room.
If you don't have a lock or don't like wearing iron socks, you can try using a hair dryer if one is available.
Do not allow the fabric to overheat (this can cause itching or even burning in extreme cases).
There are different ways to purify water, some more effective against specific threats.
In some areas, it takes only a minute to boil the water, while in others, it takes several more minutes for it to boil.
Filters vary in effectiveness, and if you're worried about that, you might want to consider buying your water in a sealed bottle from a well-known brand.
Travelers may encounter insects unfamiliar to them from their own region.
Insects can spoil food, cause irritation, or worse, cause allergic reactions, poison, or spread infection.
Dangerous animals that can inflict infectious diseases themselves or that can injure or kill people by force are generally not covered by pests.
Duty-free shopping is the opportunity to buy goods that are exempt from taxes in certain places.
Travelers to heavily taxed countries can save, sometimes significantly, especially on alcoholic beverages and tobacco products.
The terrain between Point Marlon and Fairmont offers some of the most challenging driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Highway, which often passes through remote, backward regions.
If you are not used to driving in the countryside, beware of steep slopes, narrow lanes, and sharp turns.
The published speed limits are noticeably lower than those of the previous and subsequent installments  typically 35-40 mph (56-64 km/s)  and are more important than a strictly enforced opposite.
Strangely, cell phone signals here are stronger than in other parts of the route, like the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German pastries are very good and in Bavaria, like in its southern neighbour Austria, they are very rich and varied.
Cooked apples are poured into the dough work throughout the year, and fruit dough work is common with cherries and plums showing themselves in the summer.
Many German pastries also include almonds, nuts and other tree nuts. The much-requested cakes generally make a particularly good pairing with a cup of unsweetened plain coffee.
If you want a small but rich bakery, try what's called a Berliner, Pfannkuchen or Krapfen, depending on which region you're in.
Curry is a dish containing dried herbs and spices in addition to meat or vegetables.
Curry can be called "dry" or "wet" depending on the amount of liquid it contains.
In the interior parts of northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is used in curries; in southern India and some other coastal parts of the subcontinent, coconut milk is widely used.
When referring to Indonesia, with its 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian cuisine is a catch-all term that encompasses a variety of regional cuisines found throughout the country.
However, when used without another qualifier, the term is used for food from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Javanese cuisine, which is now widespread in the archipelago, is distinguished by a number of basic, spiced dishes. The main spices important to Javanese are peanuts, bitter pepper, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar), and various aromatic spices.
The surface is the supports for the rider's legs, which swing on either side of the saddle.
They provide more stability for the rider, but they can have safety issues because of the possibility of the rider's foot getting stuck on them.
If a rider falls from a horse and one of his legs gets caught in the leg, and the horse runs away, the rider may be dragged.
First of all, most riders wear very narrow riding boots with heels and smooth soles.
Some saddles, especially British saddles, have safety bars that allow the saddle to fall off the saddle by pulling the saddle backwards as a falling rider pulls back.
Chile's premier climbing destination is the Cochamó Valley, known as the Yosemite of South America for its high granite walls and steep cliffs.
Peak climbing involves the spectacular view of the summit, and climbers from all over the world are constantly finding new routes through endless possibilities of climbing.
Downhill snow sports, such as skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports that involve skating or snowboarding down snow-covered terrain.
Skiing is an important travel activity for many enthusiasts, also called "skiing buffs", who plan their entire vacation to ski in a particular location.
The idea of skiing is very old. The cave paintings of skiers date back to 5000 BC!
Alpine skiing as a sport dates back to at least the 17th century, and in 1861 the first ski club for sporting purposes was opened in Australia by Norwegians.
Backpacking: This activity is also called backpacking, backpacking, backpacking, backpacking, backpacking, backpacking, backpacking, backpacking, backpacking, backpacking, backpacking, backpacking, backpacking, backpacking, backpacking, backpacking, backpacking, backpacking, backpacking, backpacking, backpacking, backpacking, backpacking, backpacking, backpacking, backpacking, backpacking, backpacking, backpacking, backpacking, backpacking, backpacking, backpacking, backpacking, backpacking, backpacking, backpacking, backpacking, backpacking, backpacking, backpacking, backpacking, backpacking, backpacking, backpacking, backpacking, backpacking, backpacking, or other activities that are common in rural areas.
It is similar to but usually slightly different from alpine style skiing or mountaineering, which are sports performed on steep terrain and require much harder skis and boots.
Think of a ski route as a kind of walking route.
If conditions are good, you'll be able to cover much more distance than you would walk, but without well-maintained tracks and a heavy backpack, you'll rarely reach cross-country ski speeds.
Europe is a relatively small continent but home to many independent countries. Under normal circumstances, traveling to more than one country means going through many visa applications and passport controls.
The Schengen area, in this sense, is more or less a single country.
As long as you're in this area, you can usually cross the border without going through passport control again.
Similarly, by obtaining a Schengen visa, you do not have to apply for a visa to each Schengen country separately, thus saving time, money and paperwork.
There is no comprehensive definition of what manufactured items are antiques, and some tax authorities define goods as antiques when they are over 100 years old.
The definition of antiquities varies by geography, as the age limit may be shorter in regions such as North America than in Europe.
Handcrafted products can be classified as antiques, even though they are newer than similar mass-produced products.
Deer farming is an important source of livelihood for the Sami people, and the culture surrounding the trade is also important to many people in other professions in the Rhine.
Although traditional, not all Sami subsisted on large-scale reindeer husbandry, but on fishing, hunting, or similar occupations, and often used reindeer as their livestock.
Today many Lapons work in modern trades.
Although widely used, especially among non-Romani people, the word "gypsy" is often considered offensive due to its association with negative stereotypes and incorrect perceptions of the Romani people.
If the country you are visiting is subject to a travel warning, this may affect your travel health insurance or your cancellation insurance.
You can also consult the advice of governments outside your own government, but their advice is for their own citizens.
For example, American citizens in the Middle East may face different situations than Europeans or Arabs.
Advice is only a brief summary of the political situation in a country.
The ideas put forward are often superficial, general, and oversimplified in comparison to more detailed information elsewhere.
Severe weather is a general term for hazardous weather conditions that can cause damage, serious social damage, or loss of life.
Severe weather can be found all over the world and has different types depending on geography, topography and atmospheric conditions.
Like high winds, hail, heavy rain, and wildfires, storms, tornadoes, water tornadoes, and hurricanes are among the forms and effects of severe weather.
It includes regional and seasonal severe weather events, snowstorms, ice storms, and dust storms.
Passengers are strongly advised to be aware of the risk of severe weather affecting the area they are going to, otherwise their travel plans may be adversely affected.
Anyone planning to visit a country that could be considered a war zone must have professional training.
An online search for "enemy perimeter route" will likely yield the address of a local company.
In a course, all the topics normally discussed are often covered in more detail and with practical experience.
A course normally lasts 2-5 days and includes acting, quite a bit of first aid training and sometimes weapons training.
Books and magazines on trying to survive in the wilderness are common, but publications on overcoming war zones are rare.
Travelers planning sex-change operations abroad should make sure they have valid documents with them on the way back.
Each government's willingness to issue gender-non-X passports or renewed documents to accommodate desired names and genders varies.
The preference of foreign governments for these documents varies widely.
Security checkpoint searches became much more invasive in the post-9/11 era.
Trans people who are pre-op should not expect to pass through the scanners without compromising their privacy and reputation.
Rip currents are currents that often return from waves that have been broken on a reef or similar shore.
Due to its underwater topology, the return flow is concentrated in several deep sections, where a fast current into deep water can occur.
Most deaths are the result of trying to swim against the current, which can be impossible, due to exhaustion.
It's no different than normal to swim back out of the current.
Try to aim for a place where you won't get caught again, or you can choose to wait for help, depending on your skills or if you're not noticed.
Re-entry shock is more pronounced than culture shock, honeymoon is shorter, it lasts longer, and it can be more severe.
Travelers who can easily adapt to a new culture sometimes have a hard time adjusting to their local culture again.
When you return home after living abroad, you have adapted to a new culture and lost some of the customs of your native culture.
When you first go abroad, people are probably patient and understanding, knowing that travelers in a new country have to adapt.
People may not foresee that they will have to be patient and understanding with travelers returning to the country.
The pyramid sound and light show is one of the most interesting things for kids in the area.
You can see the pyramids in the dark and watch them silently before the show starts.
You usually hear the voices of tourists and vendors all the time, and the story of the voices and the light is like a storybook.
The sphinx has been identified as the background and narrator of a long story.
The scenes are projected onto the pyramids and different pyramids are illuminated.
Various countries have claimed rights to the South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, and the islands have the most active bases, with sixteen in 2020.
The largest island in the archipelago is King George Island, 120 km north of the peninsula, where the settlement of Villa Las Estrellas is located.
Others include Livingston Island and Deception, where the flooded caldera of a still-active volcano has created a magnificent natural harbor.
Ellsworth Land is in the southern part of the peninsula, surrounded by the Bellingshausen Sea.
The Peninsula mountains here join the plateau, then resurface to form the 360 km Ellsworth Range, which is split in two by the Minnesota Glacier.
The northern part, or Sentinel Mountains, contains the Vinson Massif, the highest mountains in Antarctica, with the summit being Mount Vinson at 4,892 m (16,920 ft).
In remote areas where cell phone coverage is limited, satellite may be your only option.
To make a phone call, you need to be able to see the satellite clearly, and for that you need to be out in the open, so the satellite phone is often not a replacement for the cell phone.
This service is frequently used by cruise ships and transport vessels, including explorers with remote data and voice requirements.
Your local telephone service provider should be able to provide more information about connecting to this service.
An increasingly popular option for those planning a gap year is to travel and learn.
This is especially popular among high school dropouts, and allows them to take a year off before college without sacrificing their education.
Enrolling in a course abroad, often for a gap year, can actually increase your chances of returning to higher education in your home country.
These courses usually cost a fee to enroll in.
Finland is a wonderful boating destination, and the "land of a thousand lakes" has thousands of islands, mostly in lakes and offshore islands.
You can't be a yacht on the islands and lakes.
While the coastal islands and the largest lakes are indeed large enough for any yacht, smaller boats and even a raft offer a different experience.
In Finland, where one boat is lost to every seven or eight people, boating is a traditional activity.
It's the same as Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but it's pretty unique outside of that.
Most authentic Baltic cruises include a long stay in St. Petersburg, Russia.
That means you can sleep back on the ship at night and tour the historic city for a couple of full days.
From 2009, if you only go ashore by boat, you won't need a visa either.
Some cruise brochures also list Berlin, Germany. As you can see from the map above, Berlin is not close to the sea and travel to the city is not included in the price of the cruise.
Flying can be a frightening experience for people of all ages and cultures, especially those who have never flown before or have experienced a trauma related to flying.
This is nothing to be ashamed of: it is no different from the personal fears and other dislikes that many people have.
For some, understanding how an airplane works and what happens during a flight may help overcome a fear of the unknown or of being out of control.
Large payments are made to courier companies to deliver goods quickly, often with commercial documents, goods, or spare parts for an emergency repair.
Some routes have their own planes, but other routes and smaller companies were having trouble.
If the goods were shipped by airline cargo, it could have taken days to unload and clear customs on some routes.
The only way to get through it faster is to send it as checked baggage, because airline regulations won't allow them to send baggage without a passenger, and that's where you come in.
The obvious way to fly first class is to pay a hefty sum of money for the privilege (or, better yet, have it done for you by your company).
But it's not economical, and you can pay up to four times the normal price for business class and up to eleven times the normal price for first class!
Generally speaking, it doesn't even make sense to call for a discount on business or first-class seats on direct flights from A to B.
Airlines realize that there is a core group of passengers who are willing to pay a fortune for the privilege of getting somewhere quickly and comfortably, and they set their prices accordingly.
The capital of Moldova is Chisinau. The country's native language is Romanian, but Russian is widely spoken.
Moldova is a multiethnic republic that is heavily affected by ethnic conflicts.
In 1994, this conflict led to the establishment of the self-proclaimed Republic of Transdniester in eastern Moldova, which had its own government and currency but was not recognized by any UN member states.
Despite the failure of the political talks, economic relations between these two parts of Moldova have been re-established.
The main religion in Moldova is Orthodox Christianity.
Izmir is the third largest city in Turkey, with a population of about 3.7 million, the second largest port after Istanbul and a very good transportation hub.
Once an ancient city, Izmir has now become a modern, developed and busy trading center, built around a large bay and surrounded by mountains.
Although the city has a more Mediterranean European air than traditional Turkey, with its 18th-century market, historic mosques and churches, the wide boulevards, glass buildings and modern shopping malls are surrounded by traditional red tiled roofs.
The village of Haldarsvík offers views from the nearby island of Eysturoy and has an unusual octagonal church.
In the churchyard, several tombs have interesting marble statues of pigeons.
It's worth spending half an hour to wander through the charming village.
To the north and within easy reach is the romantic and enchanting town of Sintra, made famous by foreigners after Lord Byron recorded his eulogy of its grandeur.
The 403 Scotturb bus, which stops fairly frequently at Cabo da Roca, goes to Sintra.
Also to the north, visit the great Shrine of Our Lady of Fatima, the site of the world-famous apparition of the Virgin Mary.
Please remember that you are visiting an area that is essentially a mass grave, and also an area that has almost incalculable significance for a significant portion of the world's population.
There are many men and women who are still alive, who managed to escape from here, and there are many loved ones, both Jews and non-Jews, who were murdered here or forced to die.
Please treat the camp with all the dignity, seriousness and respect it deserves, and don't make jokes about the Holocaust or the Nazis.
Do not disrespect them by carving buildings or writing graffiti.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. About half of the population prefer to speak Catalan, the vast majority understand it, and almost everyone speaks Spanish.
However, most of the signs are only Catalan, as it is designated by law as the first official language.
Yet, Spanish is also widely used in public transportation and other facilities.
Regular announcements in the Metro are made only in Catalan, but unplanned disruptions are announced by an automated system in a wide variety of languages, including Spanish, English, French, Arabic and Japanese.
Parisians have a reputation for being self-centered, rude and arrogant.
While this is often a false superstition, the best way to stay out of trouble in Paris is to act in a dignified manner, like a "bien élevé", which will make it much easier to stay out of trouble.
The hard exterior of Parisians will be quickly lost when you show some basic subtlety.
The Plitvice Lakes national park is a dense forested area, mostly of pine, cypress and conifer trees, and reflects a composition of Alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
Due to the microclimate diversity, different soils and varying altitude levels, it has a fairly wide plant diversity.
The region is also home to a very wide variety of animal and bird species.
Many more common species can be found here, as well as rare fauna such as the European badger, wolf, eagle, owl, falcon, wildcat and woodpecker.
When visiting monasteries, women are required to wear skirts that cover their knees and their shoulders are also covered.
Most monasteries offer blankets for women who come unprepared, but if you bring your own, especially if it's a bright color, the monk or nun at the entrance will smile at you.
Similarly, men should wear pants that cover the knees.
This one can be borrowed from the stack in the entrance, but these clothes don't wash off after every user, so you can avoid wearing these skirts.
Mallorcan cuisine, like that of similar regions in the Mediterranean, is based on bread, vegetables, and meat (especially pork), and uses olive oil in all dishes.
A popular dinner, especially in summer, is Pa amb Oli, which includes bread, olive oil, tomatoes, and easily available cheese, tuna, and other flavorings.
With Sie, which means you, all names always start with a capital letter, even in the middle of a sentence.
This is an important way to distinguish between certain verbs and objects.
It's a little more complicated to write because of the need to find out if a verb or adjective is used in the noun form, but it probably makes it easier to read.
Italian is easier than other languages because in Italian most words are pronounced exactly as they are written.
The main letters to watch out for are c and g, whose pronunciation varies with the vowel that follows.
And make sure you pronounce the R and rr differently: "Caro" means sweetheart, and "carro" means carriage.
Persian has a relatively easy and predominantly regular grammar.
Therefore, reading this grammar book will help you learn a lot about Persian grammar and better understand expressions.
Needless to say, learning Portuguese will be easier if you know a language from the Latin family.
However, even those who know a little Spanish may conclude that it is a language close to Spanish in a short time, so that they also do not need to study Portuguese.
Premodern observatories are today generally outdated and continue to exist as museums or educational spaces.
In their heyday, light pollution was not as much of a problem as it is today, but they were often found in cities or on campuses that were more accessible than those built in modern times.
Most modern research telescopes are huge facilities in remote areas with suitable atmospheric conditions.
The sight of the cherry blossom, known as hanami, has been a part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
The concept comes from China, where the most popular flower is the plum blossom.
In Japan, the first cherry blossom parties were held by the emperor and only he and other members of the aristocracy around the Imperial Court could attend.
Plants look their best when they are in a natural environment, so resist the temptation to take "just one" sample.
If you're visiting an officially sanctioned garden, collecting "examples" will also get you fired without question.
Singapore is generally a very safe place and very easy to get around, so you can get everything you want as soon as you arrive.
But in Singapore, just a few degrees north of the equator, in the "high tropics", you have to deal with both heat (always) and strong sun (rarely when the weather is cloudless).
There are several buses that go to El Halil, the traditional burial place of the apostles Abraham, Isaac, Jacob and their wives, mentioned in the Bible.
Make sure that the bus you are thinking of taking is not only going to the nearby Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba, but also to El Khalil.
As the main theme of a holiday, the waters are a good choice.
For example, you can visit the Loire Valley, the castles of the Rhine Valley, or take a boat trip to interesting cities on the Danube River or the Erie Canal.
They also set routes for popular nature walks and bike trails.
Christmas is one of the most important Christian holidays and is celebrated as the birthday of Jesus.
Many of the traditions associated with the holiday have been adopted by nonbelievers in Christian lands and by non-Christians around the world.
It is customary to spend Easter night awake in an open field to watch the sunrise.
There are Christian explanations for this tradition, of course, but it's possible that it was a pre-Christian ritual that symbolized spring and fertility.
More traditional churches hold the Saturday night Easter Vigil during Easter weekend, and congregations often begin midnight celebrations to celebrate Christ's resurrection.
All the first animals to arrive on the islands came here by swimming, flying or hovering.
The distance to the mainland has prevented the mammals from making the journey, making the giant tortoise the main grazing animal on the Galapagos.
Since the arrival of the human being on the Galapagos, many mammals have been brought in, including goats, horses, cows, rats, cats and dogs.
If you visit the Arctic or Antarctic in the winter, you experience the polar night, which means that the sun does not rise above the horizon.
This provides a good opportunity to see the aurora borealis, as the sky will be dark almost every hour.
Since the regions are sparsely populated and therefore light pollution is usually not a problem, you will also be able to enjoy the stars.
Japanese work culture is more hierarchical and formal than Westerners are used to.
Standard workwear is a suit, and co-workers address each other by their surnames or job titles.
It's more important to have a workplace that celebrates the team's efforts than to celebrate individual achievements.
Workers must often seek the approval of their superiors for any decision they make and are expected to obey their superiors' orders without question.
