"We now have four-month-old mice that are no longer diabetic", he added.
According to Dr. Ehud Ur, a professor of medicine at Dalhousie University in Halifax, Nova Scotia, and chairman of the clinical-scientific division of the Canadian Diabetes Association, research is still in its infancy.
Like some other experts, he doubts that diabetes is curable, noting that these findings do not apply to people who have already developed type 1 diabetes.

In late 2017, Siminoff appeared on the QVC shopping channel.
In addition, Ring settled a lawsuit with competitors, the security firm ADT Corporation.
Although an experimental vaccine has been found to reduce mortality from Ebola, no drug has yet been shown to be effective in treating an existing infection.
The ZMapp antibody cocktail initially showed promise in this area, but official research has shown that it has less of a benefit in preventing death than previously expected.
In the PALM trial, ZMapp served as a control level, meaning that the scientists used it as a baseline and compared it to the other three treatments.
The USA Gymnastics Federation supports the letter from the U.S. Olympic Committee and agrees with the absolute need to create a safe environment for all of our athletes.

Not only does this confirm that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, which is already a widely held theory, but it also provides details that are not normally obtained from fossils, such as colour and three-dimensional structure.
Scientists say that the animal's plumage was brownish-brown on the upper side and pale or carotenoid on the lower side.
The find also provides insight into the evolution of feathers in birds.
Since dinosaur feathers lack a well-developed rod called a rachis, but still have other distinctive features - beards and whiskers - researchers have concluded that the rachis likely evolved later through the evolutionary development of other distinctive features.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used for flight, but rather for temperature regulation and demonstration, and the researchers hypothesized that although it is the tail of a juvenile dinosaur, the specimen represents adult plumage, not the plumage of a chick.
The researchers hypothesized that, although it was a young dinosaur's tail, this specimen had adult feathers, not chickens' plumage.
Yesterday morning, a car was blown up outside the Gaziantep police headquarters in Turkey, killing two police officers and injuring more than 20 others.
The governor's office said that 19 of the wounded were police officers.

They found that the Sun works on the same basic principles as other stars: they found that the activity of all the stars in the system is determined by their brightness, their rotation and nothing else.
The sum of luminosity and rotation is used to determine the Rossby number of the star associated with the plasma flow.
The smaller the Rossby number, the less active the star is in relation to the inversions of the magnetic field.

The work was mostly theoretical, but the program was written to simulate observations of the Sagittarius galaxy.
The effect the team was looking for could be caused by tidal forces between the galaxy's dark matter and the Milky Way's dark matter.
Just as the Moon is pulling on the Earth, causing tides, the Milky Way is pulling on the Sagittarius.
Scientists were able to conclude that dark matter would interact with other dark matter in the same way that ordinary matter does.
According to this theory, a large portion of the dark matter around the galaxy is arranged in a halo and consists of a large number of small particles.
Television reports have reported white smoke coming from the plant.

In a study in the KwaZulu-Natal region of South Africa , Dr. Tony Moll was able to detect extremely drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB).
In an interview, he said that the new strain "is of great concern because it leads to a very high mortality rate".
Some of the patients could have been infected in the hospital, Dr. Moll thinks, and at least two were health care workers in the hospital.
In one year, an infected person can infect 10 to 15 people with close contact.
However, the percentage of people with multidrug-resistant TB in the entire TB population still seems low; 6,000 out of the 330,000 infected at this particular time in South Africa.

They're colder than the surrounding surface during the day, and warmer at night.
Their thermal characteristics are not as stable as those of large caves on Earth, which often maintain a nearly constant temperature, but they correspond to what are deep pits in the ground,  reported Glen Cushing of the planetary geology department of the US Geological Survey and Northern Arizona University, located in Flagstaff, Arizona.
In France, voting is traditionally done by low-tech methods: the voter closes in the booth and puts a pre-printed sheet of paper indicating the chosen candidate in an envelope.
After the officials have verified the identity of the voter, he puts the envelope in the ballot box and signs the voter list.
The French electoral law is rather rigid in its procedures.
Since 1988, ballot boxes must be transparent so that voters and observers can be sure that there are no envelopes inside at the beginning of the vote and that no envelopes are added to them other than those of the people who were allowed to participate in the vote and whose votes were counted properly.
Candidates can send their representatives to monitor the process, and in the evening, the votes are counted by volunteers under strict supervision in accordance with a special procedure.

UN peacekeepers who arrived in Haiti after the 2010 earthquake have been blamed for the spread of the disease, which started near their military camp.
The suit alleges that the waste from the UN camp was not properly treated, and that the bacteria ended up in the Artibonite River, one of the largest rivers in Haiti.
Before the arrival of the troops, the state of Haiti had not faced any problems with this disease since the early 19th century.

The accused are named Baba Kanjar, Bhut Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar and Vishnu Kanjar.
Police Chief Chandra Shekhar Solanki said that the accused were presented before the judges with their faces covered.
Although three people were inside the building when the car hit it, no one was hurt.
However, the driver sustained serious head injuries.
The road where the accident occurred was temporarily closed while emergency services released the driver from the red Audi TT.
He was initially admitted to James Padgett Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was subsequently moved to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
The Edinburgh Sheriff's Court subsequently charged Adecco with the murder of her son.
She is in custody awaiting indictment and trial, but any witness statements could be distorted as her popularity was widely used by the media.
This is common practice in other parts of the UK, but Scottish justice works differently, and the courts have deemed the publication of the photos potentially damaging.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee notes that "journalists seem to be really on the edge of their seat, publishing photos and other details about the suspects".
The Crown Prosecution Service, which is in overall charge of the prosecution, told reporters that no further comment would be made, at least until the indictment was handed down.
The document, according to the leak, will address the dispute over the borders that Palestine wants to establish based on those that existed before the start of the 1967 Six-Day War.
Other topics reportedly touched upon included the future status of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both peoples, and the issue of the Jordan River Valley.
Israel demands a permanent military presence in the valley for ten years after the agreement is signed, while the PNA agrees to maintain such a presence for only five years.
The arrows that were included in the additional pest control test had to be closely monitored by the rangers, as this test was supervised and its effectiveness was evaluated.
As part of a partnership between the NPWS and the Sport Shooting Association of Australia (NSW), a qualified volunteer was recruited through the Sport Shooting Association's hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, acting director of parks and heritage conservation for the Wildlife and National Parks Service, the four shooters selected for the first shooting operation have undergone comprehensive safety training and briefings.
Yesterday, Mr. Martei took the oath of office for the new nine-member Provisional Electoral Council (PEC).
This is Martei's fifth CEP in four years.
Last month, a presidential commission recommended the previous Provisional Electoral Council resign as part of a package of measures to move the country towards new elections.
The commission was Martelli's response to the mass protests against the state regime that began in October.
These sometimes violent protests were triggered by the failure to hold elections, some of which were due to take place as early as 2011.
There were about 60 cases of overheating faulty iPods, resulting in six fires and four minor burns.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said it was aware of 27 cases involving these devices.
Last week, the Ministry of Economy, Labour and Industry announced that Apple had informed it of 34 additional cases of overheating, which the company called "insensitive".
In response, the ministry called the delay in Apple's report "very regrettable".
At 7:19 am local time (21:19 GMT on Friday) an earthquake occurred in Mariana.
The Northern Mariana Islands Emergency Management Agency said there were no reports of damage in the country.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also said there were no signs of a tsunami.
A former Filipino policeman has hijacked a tourist bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines, and taken Hong Kong tourists hostage.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 rifle at the tourists.
Several hostages have been rescued, and at least six are presumed dead at this time.
Six hostages, including children and elderly people, were released earlier, as were the Filipino photographers.
Later, photographers took the place of an elderly woman who had gone to the toilet.
Lygins followed in his father's footsteps and began a career in medicine.
He trained as an obstetrician-gynecologist and began working at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
When Liggins was working at the hospital, he started investigating preterm births in his spare time.
His research showed that if you inject the hormone, it enhances the maturation of the baby's lungs during the fetal development.
State investigators discovered two onboard jukeboxes, or "black boxes", on Wednesday, Xinhua reports.
The fellow wrestlers also paid their respects to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said, "Luna was the first Queen of Extreme. She was my first manager. Luna passed away on the night of the two moons. It's an event as unique as she is. She's a strong woman".
Dustin "Goldast" Runnels said, "The moon was as bad as I am... maybe worse... I love her and I'll miss her... hopefully she's in a better place".
Of the 1,400 people polled in the run-up to the 2010 federal election, the number opposing Australia becoming a republic has risen by 8 percent since 2008.
Acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard during the 2010 federal election campaign expressed the view that Australia should become a republic after the reign of Queen Elizabeth II.
34% of those polled share this view and want Queen Elizabeth II to be Australia's last monarch.
The survey showed that 29 percent of respondents believe that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, and 31 percent believe that it does not need this form of government.
The Olympic gold medalist was due to compete in the 100m and 200m freestyle and the three relays at the Commonwealth Games, but due to his complaints his fitness is now in doubt.
He was unable to take the medication needed to relieve the pain, as it is forbidden in the Games.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest prime number known to date on January 25.
On Tuesday, it was announced that by early February, several people had confirmed the discovery using various hardware and software.
Comets may have been the source of water on Earth, as well as the source of organic matter that could form proteins and support life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form, especially Earth, because comets have been colliding with Earth for a very long time.
Cuomo, 53, took office as governor earlier this year and signed a bill legalizing same-sex marriage last month.
He called the rumors "political chatter and nonsense".
He is expected to run for president in 2016.
NextGen  is a system that the Federal Aviation Administration says will allow planes to fly on shorter routes and save millions of gallons of fuel annually, as well as reduce carbon emissions.
It uses satellite technology instead of the old technology based on ground-based radar, which will allow air traffic controllers to better determine the position of aircraft and give pilots more accurate information.
Wembley has no additional transportation, no overhead trains, and no surface parking or intercepting.
Concerns about the lack of transportation have led to speculation that the game may have to be played behind closed doors without fans.
A study published Thursday in the journal Science describes the emergence of a new species of bird in the Galapagos Islands of Ecuador.
Researchers at Princeton University (U.S.A.) and Uppsala University (Sweden) reported that by mating the endemic Darwin's cranberry (Geospiza fortes) with the migratory cactus cranberry (Geospiza conirostris), a new species evolved in just two generations, although it was thought that this process would take much longer.
Gold can be shaped into any shape, and it can be rolled into very small shapes.
It can be stretched out into a thin wire that can be braided and plated, it can be beaten or rolled into rolls.
It can be made very thin and attached to another metal, and it can be made so thin that it was sometimes used to decorate hand-painted illustrations in books -- so-called "face handwriting".
It's called the pH of a chemical, and you can make an indicator out of the juice of a red cabbage.
Cabbage juice changes color depending on how acidic or alkaline the chemical is.
The pH value is determined by the degree of hydrogen ion saturation (H in pH) of the chemical compound being studied.
Hydrogen ions  are protons that have been separated from electrons (hydrogen atoms are composed of one proton and one electron).
Mix two dry powders in a container to make a new mixture, and then with clean, wet hands, mold the balls from the mixture.
The moisture on your hands will react with the top layer, which is unusual, and then a shell-like structure will form.
Almost every house in Harappa and Mohenjo-Daro had a flush toilet connected to a complex sewer system.
Fragments of the sewer system have been found in houses in Minoan cities on the Greek islands of Crete and Santorini.
Toilets were also used in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public baths, where men and women bathed together.
When you call someone thousands of miles away, you're using a satellite.
A satellite in space receives a call and reflects it back down almost instantly.
A satellite was launched into space by a rocket, and scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts our light and our view to some degree.
To launch a satellite or a telescope into space requires a giant rocket more than 100 feet high.
The wheel has changed our world in an incredible way, and the most important thing it has done for us is give us a much easier and faster way to get around.
It has given us a train, a car, and many other means of transportation.
Beneath them are larger numbers of medium-sized cats that eat small prey ranging from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
And finally, many small cats (including stray domestic cats) eat and hunt many more small animals, such as insects, rodents, lizards and birds.
The secret to their success is the concept of niche, the specific job that each cat species does, which keeps it from competing with others.
Lions are the most social of the cats, living in large groups called pride.
The pride consists of one to three adult males in a relationship, as well as females and chicks, the number of which can reach up to thirty.
Females are usually related to each other and form a large family of sisters and daughters.
Lion pride behaves very similarly to wolf or dog packs - animals that are remarkably similar in behavior to lions (but not other large cats) and are also very dangerous to their victims.
Being a well-rounded athlete, the tiger can climb trees (though not very well), swim, jump long distances, and pull with the strength of five strong men.
The tiger is of the same genus (Panthera) as the lion, leopard, and jaguar. These four cats are the only ones that have the ability to growle.
The tiger's roar is not like a full-blown lion's roar, but more like the shouting of sentences of unreadable words.
The ocelot prefers to eat small animals, and if it has the opportunity, it will hunt monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds, and almost all the animals it hunts are much smaller than it.
Scientists believe that the ocelots track animals and find prey by smell, tracking its movement on the ground by means of their sense of smell.
They have excellent night vision and can move almost unnoticed, so they track prey by blending in with their environment and then pouncing on prey.
When a small group of organisms (a small population) separates from the main population from which they originated (for example, if they move across a mountain range or river, or if they move to a new island from which they cannot easily return), they often find themselves in an environment that is different from the one in which they were previously.
This new environment has different resources and different competitors, so the new population will need different characteristics or changes from those it had before to become a strong competitor.
The original population hasn't changed at all - it still needs the same adaptations as before.
Over time, as the new population begins to adapt to the new environment, it begins to look less and less like the rest of the population.
Over time, in thousands or even millions of years, these two populations will look so different that you can't say they're the same species.
We call this process species formation, that is, the emergence of new species, and the formation of species is an inevitable consequence and a very essential part of evolution.
Plants produce the oxygen that we breathe and absorb the carbon dioxide that we exhale.
Plants feed off the sun by photosynthesis, and they also cast shade.
We build our houses and make our clothes from plants, and most of our food comes from plants, and without plants, animals couldn't survive.
The mosasaur was the most fearsome predator of its time, so it feared no one but other mosasaurs.
Its long jaws were studded with more than 70 sharp teeth, plus an extra row of teeth on its beak, so that those who came in its path were not saved.
We don't know for sure, but it's possible that his tongue was split open, that he ate turtles, big fish, other mosasaurs, and he could have been a cannibal.
It also attacked anything that entered the water; even a giant dinosaur like a tyrannosaur would not have matched it.
Although much of their food would be familiar to us, the Romans did have their own strange and unusual dishes served at feasts, such as the wild boar, the peacock, the snail, and a type of rodent called the soni.
Another difference was that while the poor and the woman ate seated, the rich enjoyed a shared feast, eating on their sides.
The diet of ancient Romans could not have included the foods that came to Europe from the Americas or Asia in later centuries.
In particular, they had no corn, no tomatoes, no potatoes, no cocoa, and no ancient Roman had ever tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built a temple for each of their gods, one for each of their gods.
People offered sacrifices to the gods, and priests tried to please the gods by ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open temple courtyard and an inner sanctuary that could only be entered by priests.
Sometimes, as elements of the temple, special towers in the form of pyramids called "zikkurati" were built.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary for the god.
In the warm Middle Eastern climate, a house was of little importance.
Most of the Jewish family's life was spent outdoors.
Women cooked in the courtyard; shops were open stalls facing the street.
The land of Canaan was not heavily forested, so timber was extremely expensive.
The Norse sagas tell of Erik the Red being banished from Iceland for murder, and, moving further west, discovering Greenland and giving it a name.
But whatever the reason, the Eskimo tribes were already living there.
Although each of the countries was Scandinavian, there were many differences between the people, rulers, traditions and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland.
If you've seen the movie "Treasure of the Nation", you might think that the back of the Declaration of Independence was a treasure map.
Although it says something on the back of the document, it's not a treasure map.
The back of the Declaration of Independence reads, "This Declaration of Independence is signed July 4, 1776". The text is written on the bottom of the document and upside down.
Although no one knows for sure who wrote it, it is known that early in its existence, this large parchment document (measuring 293⁄4 by 241⁄2 inches) was rolled up for better storage.
So it's likely that the entry was added as a mere footnote.
Operation Neptune and the subsequent battles had liberated the north of France, but the south had not yet been liberated.
It was under the control of the "Vichist" French, who made peace with the Germans in 1940 and worked with the invaders instead of opposing them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies invaded southern France, an invasion that became known as Operation Dragoon.
In just two weeks, Free French and American forces had liberated southern France and were moving toward Germany.
A civilization is a separate culture, which is carried by a fairly large group of people living and working together, a society.
The word "civilization" comes from the Latin civilis, meaning "civic", and is a cognate of the Latin civis, meaning "citizen", and civitas, meaning "city" or "city-state", and it also expresses the size of a society in a certain way.
City-states are the precursors of nations, and civilization culture implies the transmission of knowledge across generations, a continuous cultural presence and continuous dissemination.
Small cultures often disappear without leaving any relevant historical evidence, and therefore cannot be recognized as genuine civilizations.
During the American Revolutionary War, the thirteen states, under the Articles of Confederation, first formed a weak central government, whose sole organ was Congress.
Congress lacked any authority to impose taxes, and since there was no national executive or judicial power, it relied on the power of the states, which often refused to cooperate and were unwilling to enforce all its acts.
Nor did it have the authority to override state tax laws and tariffs.
The amendment requires the unanimous approval of all the states, but the states have been so irresponsible to the central government that their representatives have often been absent.
The Italian national football team is the second most successful team in the world, along with Germany, and won the 2006 FIFA World Cup.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and Formula 1 motor racing.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern regions, where Italians from these regions compete in international competitions and the Olympics.
Japan has some 7,000 islands (the largest of which is  Honshū), making it the 7th largest island in the world!
Because of its cluster/group of islands, Japan is often referred to as an archipelago.
Taiwan's history goes back many years, to the 15th century, when European sailors passing by recorded the island's name as Ilha Formosa, or "beautiful island".
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan, initiating a transformation of aboriginal grain production methods and hiring Chinese laborers to work on its rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, Qing Dynasty forces (1644-1912) took control of the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan and in 1885 declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire.
In 1895, after its defeat in the Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, ceding Taiwan to Japan, which had ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main structures, namely the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun and the Three Window Rooms.
Most of the buildings on the edges of the complex have been rebuilt to give tourists a more accurate idea of what they looked like originally.
By 1976, 30% of Machu Picchu had been restored, and restoration work continues to this day.
For example, the most common format in the world for still photographs is 35 mm, and this was the dominant film size at the end of the analogue era.
It's still being made today, but more importantly, its aspect ratio has inherited the dimensions of digital camera images.
The 35mm format is actually a bit confusing, it's 36mm wide and 24mm high.
The aspect ratio of this format (divided by twelve to get the ratio with the smaller integers) is therefore taken as 3:2.
Many common formats (such as the APS family of formats) are equal to or close to these proportions.
The all-too-used and often-ridiculed rule of thirds is a simple recommendation that creates dynamism while maintaining a certain amount of order in the image.
It states that it is best to place the main object at the intersection of the lines that divide the image into three parts vertically and horizontally (see example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, having become rich and powerful, came under intense scrutiny.
For more than a thousand years, Christianity has united European states despite differences in language and tradition.
Her all-pervading power has touched everyone from the king to the commoner.
One of the main Christian principles is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that church funds exist for that very purpose.
The center of church power was based in Rome for over a thousand years, and this concentration of power and wealth led many to question whether this dogma was being upheld.
Soon after the war began, Britain imposed a naval blockade on Germany.
This strategy has proven effective in cutting off vital military and civilian supplies, though this blockade has violated universally accepted international laws, spelled out in several international agreements over the past two centuries.
Britain had mined international waters to prevent ships from entering entire sectors of the oceans, endangering even neutral vessels.
Since the reaction to this tactic was restrained, Germany expected a similar reaction to its unimpeded underwater warfare.
The majority of citizens and nations in the 1920s were pacifist and isolationist.
After witnessing the horrors and atrocities of World War I, nations wanted to avoid a similar situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States and accepted a job offer at the Edison Company in New York City.
He came to the United States with four cents in his pocket, a book of poems, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor, who was his superior in his previous job, to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of marking time periods; each stage of China or each family in power was a particular dynasty.
Moreover, the fragmentation and instability between each dynasty's reigns was the most notable of which was the 60-year Three Kingdoms era of the Han and Jin dynasties.
During this period, there were fierce military engagements between many of the nobles vying for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms period was one of the bloodiest periods in ancient Chinese history, with thousands of people dying fighting for a place on the throne in the great palace of Xi'an.
There are many social and political effects, such as the use of the metric system, the shift from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism and the belief that the country belongs to the people rather than to a single ruler.
Also, after the Revolution, the possibilities of work opened up to all men, allowing the most ambitious and talented to succeed.
The same is true of the military, because ranks are now based on merit, not origin.
The French Revolution also inspired many other repressed working-class representatives in other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was very interested in subjects that were not connected with the worldly life. He often visited the cave, which became known as "Hira" on the mountain "Nur" (light) for meditation.
And the cave that has survived to this day is a very vivid example of Muhammad's spiritual aspirations.
The cave is located on a mountain top north of Mecca and is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
It's very difficult to detect, even for someone who knows it exists.
You can see nothing but the clear, beautiful sky above you and the many mountains around you, and from the depths of the cave, you can see and hear only a very small part of this world.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders of the World that exists today.
The Great Pyramid was built by the Egyptians in the third century B.C.E. and is one of many large pyramidal structures built to honor the memory of the pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau, or Giza Necropolis, in Egypt's Valley of the Dead, includes several pyramids (the Great Pyramid of Giza being the largest), several small tombs, several temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built in honor of the pharaoh Khufu, and many smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built in honor of Khufu's wives and relatives.
The symbol for the upward movement of the arrow looks like a V, and the symbol for the downward movement of the arrow looks like a bracket or square without a bottom.
"Up" means you should start at the tip and bring the bow forward, and "down" means you should start where your hand holds the bow and bring it back.
Moving the bow upwards usually produces a softer sound, while the bow downwards is more forceful and forceful.
You can draw your own pattern, but remember that the pattern is printed for musical reasons, and it's usually the one you should follow.
On October 6, 1789, an angry mob of women from the market forced King Louis XVI, Queen Marie-Antoinette, their two young children (Marie-Thérèse, 11, and Louis-Charles, 4) and the King's sister, Madame Elisabeth, to return to Paris from Versailles.
They returned to Paris in a carriage, surrounded by a crowd of people who were shouting threats at the king and queen.
The crowd forced the King and Queen to open the windows wide.
At one point, one of the members of that crowd waved the head of a royal guard killed at Versailles in front of the frightened queen.
The military costs of American imperialism in the Philippines were paid by the Filipino people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the American colonial regime to pay for much of the expenses and interest on the bond loans that were moved on behalf of the Philippine government through Wall Street banking offices.
Of course, the extra profits brought by the long exploitation of the Filipinos were the main income of American imperialism.
To understand the Templars, you have to understand the context that led them to form the Order.
The era in which these events took place is called the High Middle Ages, a period of European history covering the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000-1300 B.C.E.).
The High Middle Ages succeeded the earlier Middle Ages and preceded the Late Middle Ages, which, according to the accepted view, ended around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a wide range of practical ideas, from technical progress or technological imperative to the strict view that human destinies are driven by fundamental logic associated with the laws of science and their manifestation in technology.
Most views of technological determinism share two common ideas: that the direction of technology development is virtually independent of cultural or political influence, and that, in turn, the "impact" of technology on society is determined by its own properties rather than by society.
For example, one could say that the automobile is the compulsory cause of the development of roads.
However, the nationwide road network is economically disadvantageous for only a small group of cars, so new production methods are being developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
The mass ownership of cars also leads to an increase in road accidents, which leads to the invention of new methods in health care to treat injuries.
Romanticism was largely a cultural determinism, borrowed from writers such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography shaped people, and over time, it shaped customs and cultures that were more in harmony with the place of residence of a society than arbitrary laws.
Just as Paris is called the fashion capital of the modern world, Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its fame as a center of luxury began about 400 C.E. and continued until about 1100 C.E.
Its status declined during the twelfth century mainly because the Crusaders returned with gifts such as silk and spices, which were valued higher than the goods offered in Byzantine markets.
It was at this point that the title of the Capital of Fashion was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style flourished between the 11th and 14th centuries.
At first, clothing was heavily influenced by Byzantine culture in the east.
However, due to slow communication channels, styles in the west can lag behind by 25-30 years.
The style of the vestments began to develop in Western Europe towards the end of the Middle Ages, and one of the great achievements of the time, thanks to the Crusades, was the use of buttons to fasten clothes.
Natural agriculture is agriculture that is conducted to produce enough food to satisfy the needs of the farmer and his/her family.
Natural farming is a simple, often organic, farming system that uses seeds from plants growing in a given ecosystem, along with the use of rotation and other relatively simple methods of increasing yield.
Historically, most farmers have been subsistence farmers, and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together like-minded people who feel they're being held back by society's standards, and allow those people to define who they are.
Differences between subcultures may be due to age, nationality, social status, place of residence and/or gender of the people it consists of.
The characteristics that define a subculture as distinct may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographic, or a combination of factors.
Representatives of a particular subculture often declare their belonging through the idiosyncratic and symbolic use of style, including through fashion, mannerisms, and jargon.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to illustrate several unfortunate cases where children, due to lack of due attention, unfortunate circumstances or intentional abuse, did not have contact with adults during their adulthood.
Some of these children were isolated by humans (usually their own parents), and in some cases, the rejection of their child was the result of parents' rejection of their child's serious intellectual or physical disability.
Street children may have experienced severe forms of violence or trauma before they fled or were abandoned.
Others are said to have been raised by animals; some of them lived in the wild on their own.
If he is raised entirely by animals instead of humans, the feral child exhibits behaviors (within the physical limits) that are similar in almost every way to the particular animal that raised him - for example, his fear or indifference to humans.
While project-based learning should be easier and more fun, scaffolding is ahead of many technologies.
Scaffolding is not a method of learning, but rather a form of helping those who are going through a new learning experience, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
A scaffolding can be both virtual and real, in other words, a teacher is a form of scaffolding, but it is also a form of Scrap in Microsoft Office.
The virtual learning scaffold is built into the software and is designed to remind, explain and ask questions about procedures that the learner might find too difficult to handle on their own.
Children are taken into care for a variety of reasons, ranging from neglect to abuse and even extortion.
Children should not grow up in an environment that does not provide education, care and education, but they do.
We believe the foster care system is safe for children.
Our foster care system should provide safe housing, loving guardians, stable education and reliable health care.
Patronal education should provide all the needs that were lacking in the home from which they were taken.
The Internet combines elements of both mass and interpersonal communication.
The distinctive features of the Internet lead to additional scale in terms of approach to use and satisfaction.
For example, it has been suggested that "learning" and "socialization" are important motivating factors for using the Internet (James et al., 1995)
"Personal engagement" and "long-term contacts" were also named by Ammy and McCord (1998) as new frontiers of motivation when they studied how people respond to websites.
The use of video recording has led to important discoveries in the field of microexpressions  facial movements lasting several milliseconds.
In particular, it is claimed that it is possible to tell if a person is lying by correctly interpreting their micro-expressions.
In his article "The President's Speech", Oliver Sacks described how people who have been rendered speech-impaired by brain damage can still correctly assess the sincerity of the speaker.
He hypothesized that animals such as domestic dogs might have similar abilities to interpret human behavior.
Research in the 20th century showed that there are two types of genetic variation: latent and expressed.
Mutation introduces a new genetic variation, while selection removes it from the set of variations that emerge.
Segregation and recombination with each generation blur variations between the two pools.
In the savanna, primates with a digestive system like humans have a hard time meeting their amino acid needs from available plant resources.
Moreover, failure to do so can result in such serious consequences as stunted growth, malnutrition, and eventual death.
The most accessible plant resources would be proteins found in leaves and beans, but they're poorly absorbed by primates like us if they're not cooked.
In contrast, animal foods (ant, termite, egg) are not only easily digestible but also a rich source of protein containing all the essential amino acids.
So it's no surprise that our ancestors solved the protein problem in much the same way that chimpanzees do today.
Sleep interruption is the process of purposefully waking up during normal sleep and falling back asleep after a short time (10-60 minutes).
This can be easily done with a relatively quiet alarm clock to bring you to consciousness without waking you up completely.
If you find yourself resetting your alarm clock in your sleep, you can put it on the other side of the room, which will force you to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other options, which are based on biological rhythms, involve drinking large amounts of fluids (in particular, water or tea, a known diuretic) before bedtime, which causes the person to get up to urinate.
The amount of inner peace a person has is inversely proportional to the amount of tension in his body and soul.
The lower the tension, the more positive the life force within you, and every human being has the potential to achieve absolute peace and contentment.
Anyone can achieve enlightenment, and the only thing that stands in the way of that goal is our own tension and negative attitude.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but has been supplemented by the Mahayana path of love and a host of Indian yoga techniques.
The Tibetan Buddhist principle is very simple, it consists of Kundalini yoga, meditation and the path of all-embracing love.
The Kundalini energy (energy of enlightenment) in Kundalini yoga is awakened through yoga poses, breathing exercises, mantras and visualizations.
The heart of Tibetan meditation is the Yoga of the Gods, where the visualization of various deities cleans the energy channels, activates the chakras, and brings enlightenment to the consciousness.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, which led to cooperation between the USSR and the U.S. After the war, disagreements over system, process, and culture led to friction between the countries.
Two years after the war ended, the former allies became enemies, and the Cold War began.
It was to last for the next 40 years, and it was to be fought in the real world, using proxy armies, on the battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, in Cuba and in many other places around the world.
On 17 September 1939, the Polish defences had already been broken, and the only hope was to retreat and reorganize along the Romanian K-platzdarm.
However, these plans became irrelevant almost overnight, when about 800,000 soldiers from the Soviet Red Army formed the Belorussian and Ukrainian Fronts after seizing eastern regions of Poland in violation of the Peace of Riga, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other international agreements, bilateral and multilateral.
Using ships to transport goods is by far the most efficient way to transport large numbers of people and cargo across oceans.
The job of the mariner has traditionally been to ensure a country's ability to move its people and goods, while also impeding an enemy's ability to move its people and goods.
One of the most notable recent examples of this was the North Atlantic Company during World War II, where the Americans tried to move people and supplies across the Atlantic to help the British.
At the same time, the German navy, using mostly its submarines, tried to stop this movement.
If the anti-Hitler coalition had failed, Germany would have been as likely to conquer Britain as the rest of Europe.
Goats were probably first domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began keeping them for themselves, to have milk, wool, meat and skin on hand.
Domesticated goats were generally kept in herds, which roamed the hills or other pastures, often with the care of goat herders, usually children or adolescents, which resembled the more common activity of a shepherd.
Carriage roads were built in England as early as the 16th century.
Although the paved roads were just parallel timber logs, they allowed the horses to carry heavier loads and at a higher speed than the slightly rougher roads of the time.
The splints were used for a while to keep the rails in place, but it was later found that the rails were more effective with an iron track on top.
This became a common practice, but the iron caused more wear on the wooden wheels of the carriages.
In time, wooden wheels were replaced by iron ones, and in 1767 the first rails were made entirely of iron.
The first known form of transportation was on foot, and humans began walking just two million years ago with the appearance of Homo erectus (which means upright man).
For their Australopithecine ancestors, uprightness was not so common.
Bipedal specialization is found in the Australopithecus fossil from 4.2 to 3.9 Ma, although it is possible that the sahelanthropus walked on two legs as early as 7 Ma.
We can start living more environmentally conscious lives, we can become part of the environmental movement, and we can even become activists to alleviate some of the suffering.
It's like treating symptoms, but if we want more than a temporary solution, we need to find the root of the problem and fix it.
Clearly, the world has changed dramatically as a result of mankind's scientific and technological advances, and overpopulation and extravagant lifestyles have added to the problems.
After being passed by Congress on July 4, the handwritten draft, signed by Congressman John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson, was sent several blocks away to John Dunlap's printing workshop.
In one night, 150 to 200 copies were made, now known as the "Dunlap leaflets".
The first public reading of this document was made by John Nixon in the courtyard of Independence Hall on July 8.
On 6 July, a copy was sent to George Washington, who ordered it read to his troops in New York on 9 July, and a copy arrived in London on 10 August.
The 25 Dunlap leaflets known to exist today are the oldest surviving copies of the document, the original manuscript copy having not survived.
Now, many paleontologists believe that one group of dinosaurs survived and lived to our day, and we call them birds.
They're not often considered dinosaurs because they have feathers and they can fly.
But there's a lot more to be said about birds that still look like dinosaurs.
They have scaly legs and claws, they lay eggs and walk on two hind legs like a T. Rex.
Almost all computers that are used today are based on information processing that is encoded in binary numbers.
A binary number can have only one of two values, that is 0 or 1. These numbers are called "binary numbers"  or "bits" if you use computer jargon.
It can be difficult to detect oral poisoning right away, and symptoms like vomiting are too common to diagnose quickly.
The best indication of internal poisoning may be an open container of a drug or toxic household chemical.
Read the label for the specific first aid instructions for poisoning with this particular poison.
The term "buck" is used by entomologists formally to refer to a group of insects.
The term comes from the ancient bed bugs, an insect that is well adapted to parasitise on humans.
Both predators and bedbugs are nesting species, adapted to live in their host's nest or home.
There are about 400,000 cases of multiple sclerosis (MS) in the United States, making MS the leading neurological disease of young and middle-aged people.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which is made up of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerves.
Studies have shown that MS affects twice as many women as men.
A couple may decide that raising a child is not in their best interests or in the best interests of their child.
These couples can choose to create an adoption plan for their child.
In adoption, the biological parents give up their parental rights so that the other couple can adopt the child.
The main purpose of science is to find out how the world is made by using the scientific method, which is actually the basis of most scientific research.
Scientific research is also guided by experimentation (an experiment is a test used to rule out one or more possible hypotheses), asking questions, and making observations.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on ancient texts and especially on the Latin Bible.
Aristotle's views were adopted in all scientific matters, including psychology.
As knowledge of the Greek language declined, the West found itself cut off from its philosophical and scientific Greek roots.
Many of the observed rhythms in physiology and behavior are often largely dependent on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production by the biological clock.
Periodic rhythms, which are not simply responses to external periodic stimuli, have been recorded in most living organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that will continue to self-cycle over a period of time, even in the absence of external stimuli.
Hershey and Chase's experiment was one of the first to suggest that DNA was genetic material.
Hershey and Chase implanted their DNA into the bacteria using phages, which are viruses.
They conducted two experiments, staining the DNA of phage with radioactive phosphorus and the radioactive grey protein of phage.
Mutations can produce a large number of different outcomes, depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the affected segment of genetic material, and whether the mutated cells are germline cells.
Only mutations in germline cells can be passed on to children, while mutations elsewhere can lead to cell death or cancer.
Nature tourism is interesting for those who like to travel in nature to enjoy the landscape, including wild animals and plants.
Examples of active recreation at the facility include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, visiting parks and learning about the ecosystem.
For example, visiting, photographing, and studying orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people leave small towns in the countryside to go to work, and they're passed by people whose work is in the place they just left.
In this active transportation movement, everyone is somehow connected to and supports the personal car-based transportation system.
Now, science is showing that this huge hydrocarbon economy has affected one of the stable states of the biosphere that has supported human evolution over the last two million years.
Everyone is a member of society and uses transportation systems, and almost everyone complains about these systems.
In developed countries, you rarely hear such complaints about water quality or falling bridges.
Why do we get so many complaints about transportation systems, why do they break down every day, are transportation engineers just incompetent, or are there more fundamental reasons?
The study of the movement of individual drivers and cars between two points and their interaction with each other is carried out within the framework of the study of traffic flows.
Unfortunately, it's difficult to study the intensity of motor vehicle traffic because you can't predict with 100% certainty the behavior of the driver.
Fortunately, the behavior of drivers is often quite systematic; thus, traffic flows in general have some systematicity and can be approximated mathematically.
To better represent the transport flow, relations were established between three basic quantities: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These relationships help in the planning, design, and operation of railway facilities.
Insects were the first animals to take to the air, and their ability to fly helped them evade enemies, find food and partners.
Most insects have the ability to fold their wings along their bodies, which gives them an advantage.
This gives them more places to hide from predators.
Streptococcus and coelacanths are the only insects that cannot fold their wings backwards.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system revolves around the sun.
Many believed that he was right, but many believed the opposite: that the solar system revolved around the Earth, including the Sun (and even other stars).
It seems like a good idea, because we don't feel the Earth moving, do we?
The Amazon River is the second longest and the first largest river on Earth, carrying more than 8 times the water of the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, sometimes reaching six miles in width.
A full 20 percent of the water that flows from our planet's rivers into the oceans flows from the Amazon.
The main Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 mi) long and is fed by thousands of smaller rivers.
Although the stone pyramids continued to be built until the end of the Old Kingdom, the size and technical perfection of the Giza pyramids was never surpassed.
In the New Kingdom, the ancient Egyptians admired the monuments created by their predecessors over a thousand years ago.
With a population of about 800, Vatican City is the smallest independent state in the world and the least populous.
In the Vatican, Italian is used in legislation and official communications.
Italian is also the everyday language for most people working in the state, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of the Vatican are Catholics.
People have known since antiquity about the basic chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper, as they are all found in nature in pure form and relatively easy to extract with primitive tools.
The philosopher Aristotle believed that everything was made of a mixture of one or more of the four elements: earth, water, air, and fire.
They were similar to the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although he also assumed that they would change to a new state to produce what we see.
Alloys are essentially a mixture of two or more metals.
Elements like calcium and potassium are considered metals, and of course there are metals like silver and gold.
You can also make alloys that contain small amounts of nonmetallic elements like carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter, all matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly tiny that a trillion of them could fit in the dot at the end of this sentence.
So the pencil became a good friend to many people when it came out.
Sadly, as new ways of writing came into existence, the pencil lost its status and became less widely used.
Now people are writing messages on computer screens, and they never have to deal with a hairbrush.
One can only wonder what will happen to the keyboard, as more new technologies come into use.
The principle of how an atomic bomb works is that it takes energy to get a lot of protons and neutrons to be in one nucleus.
It's like rolling a heavy cart up a hill, so the re-splitting of the nucleus releases some of that energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means they tend to decay with little or no impact.
The Moon's surface is made up of rock and dust, and the outer layer of the Moon is called the crust.
The thickness of the crust is about 70 km under the oceans and 100 km  under the continents.
It's thinner under the moon-shaped seas and thicker under the hills.
The visible side of the moon may have more moon seas because the crust is thinner, and the lava was easier to rise to the surface.
Content theories are focused on finding what makes people act or what might interest them.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that accumulate inside them as they grow up.
These theories address what makes certain people want to do what they do and what makes their environment make them do or not do certain things.
Two popular theories about content are Maslow's pyramid of needs and Herzberg's two-factor motivation theory.
There are two types of behavior that can occur when managers start managing people who were previously their equals: One extreme of the spectrum is trying to remain "your boyfriend" (or girlfriend).
Such managers have difficulty making unpopular decisions, disciplining, evaluating work, assigning responsibilities, and holding employees accountable.
At the other end of the spectrum, the individual becomes an unrecognizable individual who feels like he has to change everything the team has done and take it to himself.
Because the leader is ultimately responsible for the success or failure of the team.
This often leads to conflict between leaders and other team members.
Virtual teams follow the same standards of skill as regular teams, but there are slight differences.
Virtual team members often act as a point of contact for their immediate physical group.
They are usually more autonomous than the staff in traditional teams, because their teams can meet according to different time zones, which local management may not always understand.
The presence of a true "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p. 109) is also a unique component of a virtual team.
The "invisible team" is the leadership team to which each participant reports. The invisible team sets the norms for each participant.
Why would organizations go through the time-consuming process of creating a self-learning organization?
When all available resources are efficiently used across all functional units of the organization, creativity and inventiveness can emerge.
Ultimately, the organization's collective effort to overcome the obstacle can lead to a new innovation process that is in the best interest of the client.
Before an organization can become innovative, leaders must create a culture of innovation, knowledge sharing and experience.
Engel (2006) explains the Continuum approach as a method used to help organizations achieve higher levels of efficiency.
Neuroscience data provides physical evidence for a theoretical approach to the study of consciousness, and in this way narrows the field of study and makes it much more precise.
The relationship between brain pathology and behavior is used by scientists in their research.
It has long been known that various types of injuries, trauma, lesions and tumors in the brain affect behavior and cause changes in some mental functions.
The advent of new technologies is allowing us to see and explore structures and processes in the brain that we've never seen before.
This gives us a wealth of data and material to create simulation models that help us understand the processes that are going on in our minds.
Although AI is strongly associated with science fiction, it forms a very important branch of computer science, which considers the behavior and learning of machines and the "implementation" of intelligence.
Research in AI involves creating machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Some of the examples that I can give are: monitoring, scheduling and scheduling, responding to client diagnoses and questions, and facial, handwriting and voice recognition.
These questions are divided into separate disciplines, the purpose of which is to solve the problems we face in everyday life.
Currently, AI systems are often used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering, and the military, having been incorporated into some software applications for home computers and video games.
School field trips are very important for any classroom, and very often teachers want to take their students to places that they can't get to by bus.
Technology offers a solution through virtual tours, where students can visit a museum, an aquarium, or a beautiful artwork while sitting in a classroom.
Putting the virtual tour on public view is also a great way to remember the tour and share what you learn with future classes.
For example, every year, students at North Carolina's Bennett School create a website about their visit to the state capital, and every year, that website is updated, but the old versions are still accessible -- they serve as a commemorative album.
Blogs can also improve students' writing skills, although students often start their blogs using sloppy grammar and spelling, this usually changes due to the presence of an audience.
Since students are often the most critical audience, the blogger starts to strive to improve his writing in order to avoid criticism.
Blogging also "provides students with a better understanding of the world around them". Students are inspired to be smart and interesting by engaging readers (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a collaborative tool that motivates students to spread their learning beyond the traditional classroom.
Proper use of blogs can enable students to become more analytical and critical. By actively responding to online materials, students can define their own position in the context of others' work, as well as express their own views on specific issues (Oravek, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada's beautiful bilingual capital, with a wealth of art galleries and museums that reveal Canada's past and present.
Further south is Niagara Falls, and the north is the home of the pristine natural beauty of Muskoka and surrounding areas.
All of these things and more make Ontario truly Canadian to foreigners.
Large areas further north are sparsely populated, and some of them are virtually uninhabited.
An amazing comparison of population: There are more African Americans in the United States than there are Canadians.
The East African Islands are located in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is much larger than the others and is a unique continent in terms of wildlife.
Almost all the smaller islands are independent states or are associated with France and are known as luxury beach resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam to the region, especially in the Comoros and Mayotte.
The spread of European influence and colonization began in the 15th century, when Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered a route from Europe to India via the Cape of Good Hope.
The region is bounded on the north by the Sahel, and on the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
For women: All tourists are encouraged to say they are married, regardless of their actual marital status.
It's also good to wear a ring (just don't make it too expensive).
Women should be aware that because of cultural differences, they may feel that they are being harassed, that women are often persecuted, that they are being held by the hand, and so on.
Say no to men and don't be afraid to stand up for yourself (this is unacceptable regardless of cultural differences!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century B.C.E. It was used by the Romans, Phoenicians, and Meronids as a strategic port, called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it as Casa Branca, but abandoned it after the 1755 earthquake.
The Sultan of Morocco rebuilt the city as Ed-Dar-el-Beyda, and Spanish traders who established trading bases here called it Casablanca.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to shop in all of Morocco.
Around the old medina, it is easy to find places where traditional Moroccan goods are sold, such as tajin, pottery, leather goods, hookah and a whole assortment of trinkets, but all for tourists.
Goma is a tourist town in the easternmost part of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, on the border with Rwanda.
In 2002, the city of Goma was destroyed by the Nyiragongo volcano, which buried most of the city's streets, especially the central part of the city.
Although Goma is a safe place, it is important to check in advance on any travel outside Goma to understand the state of the fighting in North Kivu province.
It is also the starting point for climbing Nyiragongo volcano, and it is also where you can see mountain gorillas in the wild at one of the cheapest rates in Africa.
You can go around Goma by mototaxi, the usual (local) price is 500 CFA for a short trip.
Due to its relative inaccessibility, Timbuktu has become a metaphor for an exotic far-away land.
Today, Timbuktu is a poor city, but its reputation attracts tourists, and it has an airport.
In 1990 it was added to the list of World Heritage in Danger due to the danger from desert sands.
When Henry Louis Gates was filming his PBS program "Wonders of the African World", one of the most important stops was made here.
The city is very different from other cities in the country, as it is dominated by the Arabic color rather than the African.
Kruger National Park is located in northeastern South Africa, bordering Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and the Crocodile River to the south.
The park covers an area of 19,500 square kilometers and has 14 different ecological zones, each of which is home to a variety of wildlife.
It is one of the main attractions of South Africa and is considered to be the leading national park in South Africa (SANParks).
As with all South African national parks, there is a daily fee for visiting and guarding this park.
It may also be beneficial to buy a Wild Card, which allows you to visit South Africa's national parks either selectively or all of them.
The territory of Hong Kong was named after the island of Hong Kong, a place that many tourists consider the main focus of their attention.
The row of buildings that form the skyline of Hong Kong has been compared to the sparkling columned diagram of Victoria Bay.
To see the most picturesque sights of Hong Kong, you should leave the island and head for the coast of the Julong Peninsula, which is opposite.
Most of the urban development of Hong Kong Island is concentrated on the landlocked northern coast.
This is the place that the British colonists took for themselves, and if you're looking for evidence of the territory's colonial past, this is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans is the largest belt of coastal mangrove forests, extending from the coast 80 km (50 mi) inland into Bangladesh and India.
The Sundarbans is a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and part of the forest within Indian territory is called the Sundarbans National Park.
These forests are not just mangrove swamps - they also include some of the last remaining of the mighty jungles that once covered the Gangetic plain.
The Sundarbans covers an area of 3850 square kilometres, of which approximately one third is covered by water or swamps.
Since 1966, Sundarbans have been a wildlife sanctuary, and according to estimates, the area is now home to 400 Bengal tigers and about 30,000 spotted deer.
Buses depart from the inter-district bus station (across the river) throughout the day, although most, especially those heading east and to Jakarta/Bumtang, depart from 06:30 to 07:30.
Since inter-district buses are often crowded, it is advisable to buy a ticket a few days in advance.
Most areas are served by small, comfortable, and reliable Japanese Coaster buses.
The  route is a quick and convenient way to reach nearby places like Paro (150 nqltr) and Punakha (200 nqltr).
The Oiapok River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge that spans the Oiapok River and connects the cities of Oiapok in Brazil and Saint-Georges-de-l'Oiapok in French Guiana.
The two towers are 83 meters high, and the bridge itself is 378 meters long and has two lanes that are 3.5 meters wide.
The height of the bridge deck is 15 meters. Construction was completed in August 2011, it was not opened for traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is scheduled to be fully operational in September 2017, when the Brazilian customs checkpoints are expected to be completed.
The Guaraní were the most significant indigenous group inhabiting the area now occupied by eastern Paraguay, they lived as semi-nomadic hunters who also practiced subsistence agriculture.
Chaco was home to various groups of indigenous tribes, such as the Guaicuru and the Payagua, who subsisted by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, previously called the "vast province of the East Indies", was created by the Spanish conquistadors in a conflict with indigenous groups.
The Spanish began a period of colonization that lasted three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has largely managed to retain much of its original character and identity.
Argentina is known for having one of the best teams and players in the world in a sport like polo.
The biggest tournament of the year is held in December at the Las Cañitas Polo Grounds.
Smaller tournaments and matches can also be seen at other times of the year.
To find out about the news and where to buy tickets for the polo matches, visit the website of the Argentine Polo Association.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falklands Pound (FKP), which is equivalent to one British pound sterling (GBP).
Money can be exchanged at the only bank on these islands, which is located in Port Stanley opposite the FIC West store.
As a rule, British pounds are accepted throughout the islands, and credit cards and US dollars are often accepted in Stanley.
On remote islands, credit cards may not be accepted, although British and American currency may be accepted; check with the owners beforehand to see which payment method is acceptable.
It is almost impossible to exchange Falkland Islands currency outside the Falkland Islands, so exchange your money before leaving the islands.
Because Montevideo is south of the equator, it is summer when it is winter in the Northern Hemisphere, and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropics, and temperatures above 30°C are common in the summer months.
Winter can be deceptively cold: temperatures rarely fall below freezing, but the combination of wind and humidity creates a feeling of colder weather than the thermometer indicates.
There are no particularly "rainy" or "dry" seasons: the amount of precipitation is approximately the same throughout the year.
Although many of the animals in the park are used to seeing people, nature is still wild, so there is no need to feed or disturb the animals.
The park's warning is: stay within 100 yards of bears and wolves, and within 25 yards of all other wildlife!
No matter how peaceful they appear, bison, moose, bear, and virtually any large animal can attack.
Dozens of visitors are injured every year because they don't keep their distance, and these animals are big, wild and potentially dangerous, so you need to respect their privacy.
Also, remember that smells attract bears and other wildlife, so avoid preparing or carrying stinky food, and keep the camp clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. It is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of just under 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The bay was the site of a notorious naval standoff in 1889 when seven ships from Germany, the United States and Britain refused to leave the bay.
All ships were sunk except one British cruiser, and about 200 American and German sailors were killed.
During the independence struggle organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful assembly in the city led to the assassination of the Tupua chief Tamese Lealofi III.
There are many beaches, because Auckland is situated on the shores of two harbours, and the most popular beaches are in three areas.
The beaches of the North Shore (in the North Harbor area) are washed by the Pacific Ocean and stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Almost all of these beaches are sandy, safe for swimming, and many are shaded by trees such as the pohutukawa.
In central Oakland, where the prestigious residential suburbs of Mission Bay and St. Heliers are located in the Waitemata Bay, the beaches of Tamaki Drive are sprawling.
These are sometimes crowded family beaches with a good selection of shops along the shore.
The most popular local beer is "Number One", which has a simple, pleasant and refreshing taste. Another local beer is called "Manta".
There are many French wines that you can drink, but New Zealand and Australian wines are better transported.
Local tap water is perfectly safe to drink, but if you are still apprehensive, bottled water is not difficult to find.
Australians are obsessed with the idea of flat white. "Little black" is an espresso, cappuccino is served with a high layer of whipped cream (not with foam), and tea is served without milk.
The hot chocolate meets Belgian standards, and although the fruit juices are expensive, they are of excellent quality.
There are a lot of trips to the reef year-round, and injuries caused by any of these causes on the reef are rare.
However, follow the instructions of the authorities, obey all signs, and pay close attention to safety warnings.
The Kubo-medusa occurs near beaches and estuaries north of 1770 from October to April, and occasionally outside this period.
Sharks do exist, but they rarely attack people.
Crested crocodiles are not active in the ocean, and their main habitat is in the estuaries north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance allows the traveller to avoid worrying about where to stay when arriving at their destination.
Travel agents often make deals with specific hotels, but you can book through travel agents other forms of accommodation, such as camping sites.
Tour operators usually sell package deals that include breakfast, airport transfers, or even combined packages that include a flight and hotel accommodation.
They can also save the reservation if you need time to think about the offer or to obtain other documents for the destination (e.g. visas).
Any changes or requests should be made to the travel agency first, not directly to the hotel.
At some music festivals, the vast majority of participants stay overnight on the festival grounds, and most of them consider this a mandatory part of the program.
If you want to be near the stage, you'll need to arrive early to find a camping spot near the music.
Remember that even if the music on the main stage has already ended, there may be sections of the festival where the music will continue to play until late at night.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with young children.
If you are crossing the northern part of the Baltic Sea in winter, be sure to check the cabin's position, as crossing the ice creates a rather creepy noise that can disturb the most sensitive people's sleep.
Cruises to St. Petersburg include city walks, and cruise passengers are exempt from visa requirements (see conditions).
Usually, casinos make every effort to spend as much time and money as possible in the establishment, since there are no windows or clocks, and the exits are often difficult to find.
They usually offer special food, drinks, and entertainment to keep guests in a good mood and not leave the establishment.
Some establishments offer free alcohol, but drunkenness is mind-boggling, and all good players know the importance of staying sober.
Anyone who is planning to drive over high latitudes or mountain passes should take into account the possibility of snow, ice or frost.
On icy and snowy roads, friction is low, and you can't drive the car like you would on normal asphalt.
During a blizzard, enough snow to get stuck can fall in a very short period of time.
Visibility may also be limited by snow, blizzard, condensation, or ice on vehicle windows.
On the other hand, snow and ice are normal in many countries, and traffic runs almost continuously year-round.
Safari is probably the biggest tourist attraction in Africa and the main event for many travelers.
The term "safari" in everyday usage means a ground trip to see the amazing wildlife of Africa, especially in the savannah.
Some animals, like elephants or giraffes, often get close to the cars, so even with the usual equipment, you can get a good view.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards are sometimes cautious, and you'll see them better through binoculars.
A walking safari (also called bush exploration, hiking safari, or walking safari) is a hike that lasts from a few hours to a few days.
The Paralympic Games will be held from 24 August to 5 September 2021, with some events taking place in different locations across Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to host the Summer Olympics twice, the first time being in 1964.
If you have booked tickets and accommodation for 2020 before the date of the changeover is announced, you may be faced with a difficult situation.
The rules for cancellation of orders may vary, but as of the end of March, most of the coronavirus-related rules do not apply to July 2020, when the Olympic Games were scheduled.
Most tickets for the event are expected to cost between 2,500 and 130,000 yen, with a standard ticket price of around 7,000 yen.
Many hotels provide ironing boards and irons for rent, even if they are not in the room.
If you don't have any iron or you're not thrilled with the idea of wearing polished socks, you can try a fan if one is available.
Do not expose the fabric to too high a temperature (which may cause shrinkage or, in very rare cases, burn).
There are different ways to purify water, some of which are more effective against specific threats.
In some places, boiling water for a minute is enough; in others, it may take several minutes.
Filters vary in their effectiveness, and if in doubt, consider buying bottled water from a trusted company.
Travelers may encounter pests that they have not seen in their native lands.
Pests can spoil food, cause irritation, or worse, cause allergic reactions, release toxins, or transmit infections.
Infectious diseases in themselves or dangerous animals that can harm or kill humans are not generally considered pests.
Duty-free shopping is the ability to buy goods at certain points without paying taxes or excise duties.
Travelers to countries with high taxation can sometimes save a considerable amount, especially on such goods as alcohol and tobacco.
The section between Point Marion and Fermont has the most difficult driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh highway, often passing through isolated wilderness and wooded terrain.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, be on the lookout for steep slopes, narrow alleys, and sharp turns.
The established speed limits are significantly lower than on the previous and subsequent sections  usually 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h)  and strict adherence to them is even more important than the others.
However, oddly enough, the cell phone service here is much better than many other places on the route, such as the Pennsylvania Wilderness.
German confectionery is quite good, and in Bavaria it is very plentiful and varied, and is similar to that of their southern neighbour, Austria.
Fruit cakes are common, apple cakes are available all year round, and cherries and plums appear in summer.
Almonds, fondue, and other tree nuts are often used in German baking, and popular cakes often go well with a cup of strong coffee.
If you want small but filling flour confectionery, try what, depending on the region, is called a salad or doughnut filling.
Curry is a dish made with herbs and spices, mixed with meat or vegetables.
Depending on the liquid content, curry can be "dry" or "wet".
In the interior of Pakistan and Northern India, yogurt is used in curries, while coconut milk is commonly used in Southern India and some coastal regions of the subcontinent.
Indonesian cuisine, with 17,000 islands to choose from, is a catch-all term used to designate the huge variety of regional cuisines found throughout the country.
But without specifications, the term most often refers to food originating from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Javanese cuisine, which is now widespread throughout the archipelago, includes a range of simple dishes, with the greatest preference given to flavorful additives such as peanuts, chile, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar) and various aromatic spices.
The saddle is a foot support suspended from both sides of the saddle.
They provide the rider with better stability, but there can be safety issues, as there is a possibility of the foot getting stuck.
If a rider is thrown off but his foot is caught in the stirrup, the running horse may pull him back. To minimize this risk, a number of precautions can be taken.
First, most riders wear riding boots with a heeled heel, which have a smooth and fairly thin sole.
In addition, some saddles, especially English ones, have safety arches that allow the leather strap to fall off the saddle if it is pulled back by a falling rider.
The Cochamo Valley is the main destination in Chile for mountaineering. It is known as the Yosemite of South America and has a large number of large granite walls and rocks.
At the top, you can enjoy the stunning mountain scenery, and climbers from all over the world are constantly creating new routes in its vast potential for mountaineering.
Skiing and snowboarding are popular winter sports, which involve descending on snow-covered terrain on skis or snowboards attached to feet.
Skiing is a major tourist destination for many ski lovers (sometimes called "ski bumpers"), who plan their vacation around skating in a particular place.
The idea of skiing is very old: rock paintings of skiers date back to as early as 5000 B.C.E.!
Skiing as a sport dates back to at least the 17th century, and in 1861 the Norwegians opened the first recreational ski club in Australia.
Ski tourism is also known as backcountry, skiing or ski-hiking.
This is related to, but usually does not include, the pedestrian ascent to the summit and then the descent on unprepared slopes, as skiing on celery requires harder skis and boots.
Imagine that a ski trail is a hiking trail.
In good conditions, you can cover a few more distances than you would if you were walking, but you can only reach that speed on a cross-country ski in the very rare case that you don't have a heavy backpack and have a paved ski.
Europe is a relatively small continent, but it has many independent states. Under normal circumstances, traveling through many countries would require a visa application and multiple passport controls.
But the Schengen area is functioning as one country in this respect.
Once in this zone, you can usually cross the border without going through the passport control again.
Similarly, if you have a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply for a visa in each of the Schengen countries separately, which will save you time and money and avoid paperwork.
There is no universal definition of what products are considered antiques, and some tax authorities define goods that are 100 years old as antiques.
This concept has geographical variations where the age limit in places like North America may be smaller than in Europe.
Craft items can be defined as antiques, despite the fact that they are younger than similar mass-produced goods.
Reindeer herding is an important source of livelihood for the Sami people, and the culture surrounding this activity is also important for many other professions.
Although this is a tradition, not all Sámi people were engaged in the mass reindeer breeding; they lived by fishing, hunting and other similar occupations, using deer mainly as pack animals.
Today, many Sami people are employed in modern professions, and tourism is an important source of income in the Sami region of Lapland.

The course usually lasts from 2 to 5 days and includes rehearsal of situations, a large amount of first aid information and sometimes weapons training.
Books and magazines on survival in the wilderness are common, but there are few publications on the battlefield.
People planning to undergo sex reassignment surgery abroad should make sure that they have valid documents for the return journey.
Governments' willingness to issue gender-free passports or documents updated with the desired name and gender varies from place to place.
The willingness of foreign governments to fulfill their obligations under these documents is also very different.
The surveillance at checkpoints also became much more intense after the events of September 11, 2001.
Transgender people who are preparing for surgery should not expect to pass through the scanners, and their privacy and dignity should not be compromised.
A rip current is a current created by waves that crash into a shore or sometimes a reef or something like that.
The reverse current is concentrated in several deeper areas, where a fast current can be formed, leaving for a greater depth, due to similar underwater topology.
Most deaths are the result of fatigue while trying to swim back upstream, which may be impossible.
Once you're out of the current, swimming back won't be any harder than it usually is.
Try to go somewhere where you won't be caught again, or, depending on your skills and whether you've been spotted, you may have to wait for rescue.

Travelers who are able to adjust to a new culture can sometimes find it especially difficult to adjust to their own.
When you return home after living abroad, you are adapted to a new culture and have lost some of your native culture.
When you first traveled abroad, people were likely to treat you with patience and understanding, knowing that travelers need to adjust to a new country.
It may be surprising to people that patience and understanding are also needed when travelers return home.

Others include Livingston Island and Decepshin, where the flooded caldera of a still active volcano provides an impressive natural harbor.
Ellsworth Land is the area south of the Antarctic Peninsula that is washed by the Bellinghausen Sea.
The mountains of this peninsula merge with the plateau here, and then rise again to form the 360-kilometer-long Ellsworth Mountain System, divided into two parts by the Minnesota Glacier.
In the northern part, the Sentinel Range, is the highest mountain range in Antarctica, the Vinson Massif, which reaches a height of 4892 m and is called the Vinson Peak.
In remote areas outside of cell phone coverage, a satellite phone may be your only option.
A satellite phone is not generally a replacement for a mobile phone, as you need to be outside in direct view of the satellite to make a call.
The service is often used in shipping, including cruise and high-speed vessels, where there is a need for remote data and voice communications.
You can usually get more information about how to connect to the service from your local telephone company.
An option that is becoming increasingly popular for those planning to take an academic year is to travel and study.
It's especially popular among high school graduates, allowing them to take a year off before entering university without jeopardizing their education.

The cost of these courses is usually a fee.
Finland is a great place for boating.The "Land of a Thousand Lakes" also has thousands of islands in lakes and in coastal archipelagos.
You can do without a boat when you explore the archipelago or visit a lake.
While the coastal archipelagos and the largest lakes can indeed accommodate any yacht, smaller boats or even kayaks leave a very different impression.
Boating is a national pastime in Finland, with one boat for every seven or eight people.
The situation is similar in Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but in other cases it is quite unique (for example, in the Netherlands it is between one and forty).
Most of the Baltic cruises include an extended stop in St. Petersburg, Russia.
That means you can spend several full days in this historic city and spend the night back on the ship.
If you only go ashore as a boat tourist, you do not need a separate visa (since 2009).
Some cruise brochures feature Berlin, Germany, as you can see in the map above, Berlin is far from the sea and a visit to the city is not included in the cruise price.

Freight services are well paid for their speed of delivery, and often the speed of delivery of commercial documentation, goods, or spare parts for urgent repairs is very important.
On some routes, the larger companies have their own planes, but for other routes and smaller companies, this was a problem.
If they were shipping anything as air cargo, on some routes, unloading and clearing customs could take days.
The only way to get it out of the way faster is to send it as checked baggage, which is against airline regulations, so you need to be involved.
The most obvious way to fly first or business class  is to pay for the privilege (or  optionally  get your company to pay for you).
But it's not cheap. If you're trying to estimate, you'll pay four times more for business class and eleven times more for first class.
In general, it doesn't even make sense to look for discounts on business class or first class for direct flights from A to B.
Airlines are well aware that there is a certain core group of passengers who are willing to pay a hefty sum for the privilege of getting anywhere quickly and comfortably, and so they charge a corresponding fee.
The capital of Moldova is Chisinau, and the local language is Romanian, but Russian is also widely spoken.

The unwelcoming appearance of the Parisians will evaporate if you show a little basic courtesy.
The Plitvice Lakes National Park is heavily forested, mostly beech, fir and spruce, and is a mixture of alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
Due to the combination of microclimates, different soils and height differences, it presents a particularly wide diversity of plant communities.
