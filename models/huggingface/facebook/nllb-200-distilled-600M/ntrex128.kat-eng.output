Members of the Welsh Assembly are alarmed by the similarity to the muppets.
Some members of the Assembly are seriously concerned about the proposal to change their current title to MWP (Member of the Parliament of Wales).
The issue arose because the name of the Assembly is to be changed to the Parliament of Wales.
Members of the various political parties complain that they may be subject to protection.
One Labour member of the Assembly says his group is concerned that the Zs are supporting the Twp and the Pwp".
To the non-Welsh reader: in Welsh, twp means smart, and pwp means loud.
And one of the members of the Plyde Party said that his team was unhappy and that they had some alternative names.
Welsh Conservatives said they were thrilled to have come across the new name, but noted that the pronunciation of MWP is very similar to Muppet (the UK's short-lived toy television series).
In this context, the Welsh letter w is pronounced like the letter u in Yorkshire English.
The Assembly Committee, which is currently working on a bill to introduce a new name, says: "The final decision on any interpretation of the names of the members of the Assembly is, of course, made by the members themselves".
The Welsh Assembly has been granted the right to change its name by the Welsh Government's 2017 decision.
In June the Commission published the results of a public review of the options, where it won wide support for the Assembly's proposal to name the Welsh Parliament.
As for the rank of Member of the Assembly, the Commission chose the name Member of the Welsh Parliament, or WPM, but the MWP option received more support during public debate.
Members of the House are still choosing alternative options, so reaching a consensus will be a concern for Speaker Ellen Johnson, who has to introduce the bill in a few weeks.
The reform bill also includes other changes to the work of the Assembly, including the rules for disqualifying Assembly members and the scheme of the committee system.
The members of the Assembly will make a final decision on the name during the debate on the bill.
The Macedonians hold a referendum on changing the country's name
Voters will decide on Sunday whether to adopt the new name of the country, the Republic of North Macedonia.
The vote was called because of decades of dispute with neighboring Greece, which also has a province called Macedonia.
Athens has long claimed that its northern neighbor by this name is claiming its territory and is constantly opposed to its EU and NATO membership.
Macedonian President George Ivanov, who opposes the name change, says he will not pay attention to the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, say changing the name is simply the price of joining the EU and NATO.
The St. Martin's Church has been silenced because of the church's problems in Harlem.
The greedy people I spoke to say that historically, every neighborhood had a bar and a church", Mr. Adams said.
Today, none of them are.
He said the bar's disappearance was understandable.
People today are different, he said.
The bars are no longer the place where the dark gathered, where the neighbors would go all the time.
As for churches, he fears that the money from the sale of assets will not last as long as leaders have predicted, and sooner or later they will be back where they started.
Churches can be replaced with co-operative housing, where people who don't care about the churches left in the neighborhood live, he added.
The vast majority of the owners of these co-operative buildings will be white, he said, so they'll be accelerating the day when all of these churches close because people who come into these co-operative buildings won't become parishioners.
Both churches were built by the White Congregation before Harlem became a black metropolis - the Township Community Church in 1870, and St. Martin's - a decade later.
The first white Methodist congregation moved from here in the 1930s.
A nearby Congregation of Black Worshippers obtained the building rights.
St. Martin's Church was acquired by the Congregation of the Black under the leadership of St. John Howard Johnson, who boycotted the main shopping district of Harlem, 125th Street, against traders who refused to hire and encourage Black workers.
In 1939, the building was badly damaged by a fire, but because Father Johnson's rebuilding plan was drawn up, the bell was rung.
St. David Johnson, son and heir of Father Johnson, proudly called this carillon the "Lord of the Ringing of the People".
In July, a Carillon performer expert called it another name: Cultural Treasure and the Unforgettable Historical Instrument.
Tiffany Ng, an expert at the University of Michigan, also noted that this was the carillon performed by Dionysius A. Lindy, the world's first black musician, who moved to a wider carillon 18 years ago at Riverside Church.
Mr. Merrillinger said that St. Martin's Church did not change him.
In recent months, what has been done at St. Martin's has been a complex project of architects and contractors, partly by the assistant chaplain of the church, the rest by the bishopric.
The ecclesiastical council, the governing body of the parish, which consists of the assistant chaplain, wrote to the parish in July with regret that the parish was trying to pass on the expenses to the ecclesiastical council, although the latter was not involved in hiring architects and contractors sent by the parish.
Some in the parish expressed their regret over the lack of transparency on the part of the parish.
Zwichen has hired a 13-year-old cybersecurity collector in California.
According to official reports, on Saturday, the opening day of the California cyber season, Zwiggen attacked a 13-year-old boy who was shopping for cybersecurity.
The attack occurred at about 7:00 a.m. in Encinitas, near Shukura Beach.
Chad Hamel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that after a half-hour of tea on Saturday morning, he heard a boy screaming for help and he and his friends ran quickly to help him out of the water.
Hamel said that at first he thought it was a clamour of cheerleaders, but then he realized that he was screaming!
I'm going to be a little bit more careful.
When I approached, I saw that the leaf had completely healed, Hamel said.
When everyone came out of the water, I would shout, 'Swigeny is in the water!' " Hamel added.
The boy was flown by helicopter to San Diego Rade Children's Hospital, where his condition was critically evaluated.
It's unclear what kind of victim the attacker was.
Rescue Captain Larry Giles told a press conference that a few weeks ago, the locations were marked with swarms of lizards, but he said that the species was not dangerous.
Gill added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries to the upper body.
Police have banned 48 hours of beach access from Casablanca's Ponto Beach to the Ecinitas Swamy Beach for investigative and security purposes.
Gill noted that there are over 135 species of birds in these areas, but most are not considered endangered.
Sainsbury's is planning to enter the UK cosmetics market.
Unlike Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams, Sainsbury's offers customers cosmetics supplied by supermarket water heaters and specialists on duty to assist.
The £2.8 billion cosmetics market continues to grow as sales of clothing and household goods fall, a key differentiator of such a market invasion, with cosmetics delivered on grass shelves like a supermarket to be tested in 11 of the country's largest retailers and, if successful, added to more stores next year.
Cosmetic investments are being made as supermarkets are searching the shelf space that was once used for TVs, microwave ovens, and other household items.
Sainsbury's says it's doubling its list of cosmetics to 3,000 brands, including the first-ever appearance of Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman, and Dr. PawPaw.
Existing products from L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will be made even more diverse in stores like Boots.
The supermarket is resuming its Boutique make-up offering that is vegan and does not contain animal products, and the demand for such products is growing rapidly among young consumers.
In addition, the fragrance shop will be tested at Sainsbury's's in two markets, one of which opened last week in Croydon, South London, and will open at the end of the second year in Selby Oak, Birmingham.
The trend of online shopping and the daily shift to buying a small amount of food in nearby small shops is forcing supermarket owners to work harder to get visitors.
Mike Coop, CEO of Sainsbury's, says outlets are very similar to universes, as supermarket chains try to compete with frequently discounted Aldi and Lidl by offering more service and inexpensive products.
Sainsbury's has introduced Argos outlets to hundreds of supermarkets and has also developed a number of Habitats since purchasing both of these two networks two years ago, improving sales and making purchases more profitable.
The supermarket's previous attempt to transform its cosmetics and appetizers departments has failed.
In the early 2000s, Sainsbury's tried to partner with Boots, but they couldn't agree on how to split the revenue from its supermarket pharmacies.
Sainsbury's launched a new strategy three years ago by selling 281 pharmacies to Celesio, owner of Lloyds Pharmacy, for 125 million pounds.
Lloyds had to play a role in this plan, expanding into four markets with more expensive brands of skincare products like La Roche-Posay and Vichy.
Paul Mills-Hicks, chief commercial officer at Sainsbury's, says: "We've been around the city, and we've been giving people a lot of cosmetic-filled stalls.
There are also specialised staff there to assist.
Our list of brands meets all the requirements, and our attractive environment and convenient location is a serious competitor to the traditional way of shopping.
Peter Jones is furious that Holly Willoughby has terminated his £11 million contract.
Dragons Den contestant Peter Jones was angered by TV presenter Hall Willab's actions when Hall terminated his £11 million lifestyle brand business contract to focus on his new business with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Willab doesn't have time for home-made clothing and accessories for their brand Truly.
The couple's business was associated with the late Peltrou brand Goop.
This morning, the 37-year-old executive announced on Instagram that he was leaving.
Peter Jones of the Hall Willoughby Dragons' Den left a disillusioned when he left the lucrative business of their lifestyle brand at the last minute to devote all his time to a new contract with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
A source said Jones was upset when, at a tense meeting at the headquarters of his business empire, Mallow, on Saturday, the TV Gold Girl revealed that her £1.5 million new deal would not allow them time to continue to be involved in the Truly family-owned clothing and accessories brand.
The business is linked to the late Peter's brand Goop and hoped to double Willab's £11 million business.
When 37-year-old Willab announced on Instagram that he was leaving Truly, Jones left Britain for one of his summer villas.
Sources say, "Truly Hall was a top priority.
It was his long-term business, and he was going to be busy with it for the next few decades.
His decision to quit was a complete shock to everyone involved.
No one could figure out what happened on Saturday, because it was so close to starting.
The headquarters of Malmö is full of merchandise for sale".
Experts estimate that the departure of the head of This Morning, one of Britain's most high-profile celebrities, will cost the firm millions, as solid investments have been made in clothes and pyjamas, starting with pillows and candles, and likely delaying their release.
Besides, it will be the end of a long friendship.
The mother of three, Willab, and her husband, Dan Baldwin, were close friends of Jones and his wife, Tara Cap, for ten years.
Willab started with Truly Kap in 2016, and in March, Jones, 52, joined them as chairman.
In addition to the fact that couples spend holidays together, Jones owns 40 percent of the shares in Baldwin's Television Productions.
Willoughby will become M&S's brand ambassador, replacing Matt McPartly as host of the ITV show I'm A Celebrity.
A source close to John said last night that he would not comment on his business activities.
After a difficult conversation, we fell in love.
He joked that the news media criticized him, some viewing it as an unpresidential comment, and also disliked his positive attitude toward the North Korean leader.
Why does President Trump have so much?
Trump said in a voice that mimicked the speaker.
I'm not giving anything away.
He noted that after Trump's first meeting in Singapore in June, which marked a major step toward denuclearization of North Korea, Kim is interested in a second meeting.
But the negotiations on denuclearization have been slow.
Three months after the June meeting in Singapore, North Korean chief diplomat Ri Yong-hom told world leaders at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that the North did not see a response from the United States to the disarmament efforts launched by North Korea.
Instead, he added, the United States is continuing its sanctions aimed at maintaining tensions.
Trump was much more optimistic in his summary.
Our business with North Korea is going very well, he said.
There was a war with North Korea.
Millions of people would die.
And now we have a wonderful relationship.
He said his efforts to repair relations with Kim had yielded positive results -- complete missile tests, help free the hostages, and return the remaining American service to their homes.
He also defended his unusual approach to talking to Kim.
"It's very easy to be president, but instead of the 10,000 people outside trying to get into the mobile arena, we have 200 people here", Trump said, referring directly to the crowd gathered in front of them.
A tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia devastated the island, killing hundreds
For example, foreign NGOs have been told that they are not needed to assess the effects of the Lompoc earthquake.
Although 10 percent of Lombok's population is displaced, a national disaster has not been declared, which is a prerequisite for accelerating international aid.
In many cases, they have been very clear that they are not asking for international assistance, which is a little thought-provoking", Ms. Sumbun said.
Although Save the Children is already preparing a team to travel to Palo, it's not clear whether foreign workers will work on site.
Mr. Sutopo, the spokesman for the National Disaster Service, said that the Indonesian civil service is evaluating the situation in Palo Alto to determine whether to allow international aid agencies to participate.
Given the frequency of earthquakes in Indonesia, we can say that the country is completely unprepared for natural disasters.
Asha's built tsunami shelters, but you don't see them in other areas.
The lack of a tsunami warning alarm in Palo Alto, despite being known to be one of the reasons for the high death toll, has been revealed.
It is quite difficult to travel between many of Indonesia's islands, even in good weather.
Natural catastrophes will make transportation even more difficult.
A hospital ship that was docked in Lombok is on its way to Palou to treat the victims of the earthquake, but it will take at least three days to reach the new crash site.
President Joko Widodo has been a key player in his campaign to improve Indonesia's decaying infrastructure and invested a lot of money in roads and railways.
But Mr. Joko's administration has been hampered by funding problems, as he is up for re-election next year.
Mr. Joko also has a problem with sectarian conflict in Indonesia, where the majority of Muslims follow the most conservative form of faith.
More than 1,000 people have died and tens of thousands have been displaced from their homes as a result of clashes between Christians and Muslims using machetes, child-slashes and other weapons in the streets.
See: Liverpool's Daniel Sturge has hit a high ball at Chelsea's door
Daniel Sturge saved his Premier League defeat to Chelsea in the 89th minute at Stamford Bridge Stadium in London on Saturday.
Sturge received a call from Harden Sugar about 30 yards from Chelsea's gate as his team led 1-0.
He moved the ball to his left foot before hitting the distal bone.
The high-stroke penalty was passed from the top to the top right corner of the net.
Eventually, the ball fell from the top of the Cape Arisabalaga into the stream.
It was just trying to get in position, to get the ball and players like Shaq always push it as far as possible, so I was just trying to get as much time as I could", Sturge told LiverpoolFC.com.
When I saw the song coming and I played it with one hand, I didn't think much of it, so I hit it.
Chelsea won 1-0 in the 25th minute of the first half with a goal scored by Belgian star Eden Hazard.
Then the Blue Bomber returned the ball to Mateus Kovacic with a hammer before he sent the ball from the middle of the field to halfway through Liverpool.
Kovacic took it to the center of the court and quickly hit the wall.
Then he made a great, well-crafted transmission, which put him on a hefty fine.
The twin defended and the left footed ball hit a distal hip in the Liverpool Allison Baker gate.
On Wednesday, at 3 pm, Liverpool will meet at the Stade de Naples in Naples, Italy, for the group match of the Champions League.
Chelsea will play the UEFA Europa League game at 3pm on Thursday in Videoton, London.
The number of tsunami victims in Indonesia has risen to 832
On Sunday morning, the National Disaster Service reported that 832 people died in the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia.
Many people were swept away by the building's ruins when a 7.5-magnitude earthquake struck on Friday, causing waves up to 20 feet high, the ministry's press secretary, Sutopo Purwo, told a news conference.
The city of Palo Alto, home to 380,000 people, is in ruins.
Police arrested a 32-year-old man suspected of manslaughter for stabbing a woman to death
A murder investigation has been launched this morning after a woman's body was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside.
A 44-year-old woman was found dead of a gunshot wound at John Street's Grayson Mouse at 7:55 a.m., with a 32-year-old man arrested on suspicion of murder.
Police are calling neighbors who have seen or heard anything about the case.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Shaughnessy says, "The investigation is still in its infancy, but I would like to ask anyone in the John Street area of Birkenhead if they see or hear anything suspicious to contact us.
I also ask everyone, especially taxi drivers, who may have taken a video, to contact us through the registrar, because this information could be vital to the investigation.'
A police spokesman said the woman whose body was found was local and was found in a residential home.
In the afternoon, friends who knew the deceased woman came to the scene to ask where she had been found this morning.
Police say they are investigating the incident and are trying to contact the victim's immediate family.
A taxi driver who lives in Grayson Moose recently tried to return to his apartment, but police told him no one was allowed to enter or leave the building.
He couldn't say anything when he heard what had happened.
Residents were told that the investigation would take several hours before they were allowed back into the building.
A police officer told a man that this entire area is now considered a crime zone.
There was a woman crying.
He kept saying, "What a terrible thing".
At 2 o'clock in the afternoon, two police cars were inside the line, and another truck was outside.
Several officers were watching the apartment buildings from inside the line.
Anyone with any information can ask DM @MerPolCC to call 101 or anonymously contact the Crime Control Service staff at 0800 555 111 citing the September 30 247 record.
The Cromwell statue of Parliament has become the latest memorial hit in the history rewrite chain.
His portrayal is an artistic punishment for the Taliban's incursion and destruction of many of England's cultural and religious artifacts by his fanatical Puritan followers.
But the Cromwell Society calls Mr. Crick's proposal "unthinkable" and describes it as an attempt to rewrite history.
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Society, says: "In recent debates, it was inevitable that the statue of Oliver Cromwell outside the Palace of Westminster would be targeted.
Cromwell was neither commanded nor engaged in the English Civil War to fight against traditional beliefs.
Perhaps another Cromwell is being punished for the actions of his ancestor Thomas in the last century.
The masterpiece by Sir William Thornecroft is a fine testament to the 19th-century attitude towards Cromwell and is part of the historiography of the person who many consider to be of great value today.
Mr Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "It may have been more in the second half of the 19th century than it is today, but Cromwell is still considered by many to be the protector of the Parliament from external pressure during the monarchy's invasion.
Historical debates about the accuracy of this idea are still ongoing.
But one thing that can be said for sure is that the conflict in the 17th century gave impetus to the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell was a key figure in that division.
His achievements as Lord Protector are also worthy of recognition and respect.
A killer pig stabbed a Chinese farmer to death
In southwestern China, a market dog attacked and killed a farmer, local media reported.
A man with a damaged artery, bleeding, identified only as Yuan, was found dead in a market near a pig station on Sunday morning in the southern Chinese city of Liushanchu in Jiangsu Province.
A pig is preparing vaccines for pigs at a pig farm in Xi'an, China, on May 30, 2005.
On Wednesday, he reportedly went to the market with his cousin from the neighboring province of Yunnan to sell 15 pigs.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and noticed that the door to the nearby pig station was open.
He said there was a big pig in the station, digging in blood.
The forensic investigation confirmed that a 550-pound bush fell and killed the farmer, the report said.
"My cousin's feet were covered in blood and bruises", said the cousin, who was mentioned in the Guiyang Evening News as Zhuo.
Security camera footage shows Yuan entering the market at 4:40 a.m. on Thursday morning to feed pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed Juan does not belong to him or his nephew.
The market manager told Evening News that the pig was locked up in a safe, so that no one else would be attacked until the police picked up the material on the scene.
It is said that the family members and the market leaders are in talks to compensate for his death.
Although rare, there have been instances of human-to-human swine attacks before.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in Massachusetts, causing a man to become severely paralyzed.
Ten years earlier, a 450-pound Welsh farmer attacked his tractor before his frightened wife threw the animal away.
When the original farmer ate the pig in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba told CBC News that pigs are generally not aggressive, but the taste of blood can motivate them.
They're just playing.
Their children are very curious... they are not designed to hurt you outside.
"We just have to treat them with respect", he said.
Following the storm, a large-scale heavy rainfall in the southwestern United States
It is estimated that Hurricane Rosa will weaken as it approaches the cold waters of the northern coast of Mexico.
However, in the coming days of Rosa, flood-induced rains will follow in the northern regions of Mexico and the southwestern United States.
The storm, which reached a peak of 85 miles per hour at 5 a.m. on Sunday morning, was a Category 1 hurricane at 5 a.m. eastern time and was located 385 miles southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
The weekly Rose is expected to move north.
Meanwhile, a storm wall begins to form over the Pacific Ocean and it begins to move eastward toward the west coast of the United States. As Rosa Bayas approaches the California peninsula as a tropical storm on Monday, heavy tropical moisture will follow northward into the southwestern United States.
On Monday, Rosa will send 10 inches of rainfall to parts of Mexico.
Then, in the coming days, tropical moisture will interact with the nearby walls to create a large-scale storm surge in the southwest.
In places, 1 to 4 inches of precipitation will cause sudden flooding, landslides, and possibly landslides in wilderness areas.
Heavy tropical humidity will cause rainfall to rise by 2-3 inches an hour in places, especially in southern Nevada and Arizona.
2 to 4 inches of rain is expected in the southwest, especially in most parts of Arizona.
Sudden flooding can occur in rapidly deteriorating conditions due to the confused nature of tropical rainfall.
It would be particularly unwise to go out and walk in the open in the face of heavy tropical rain.
Heavy rainfall can turn canyons into heavy rivers, and heavy winds and dust storms can cause the shower to erupt.
The approaching storm will bring a wave of rainfall in parts of the southern California coast.
The total amount of precipitation can be half an inch, which will cause small clumps and road weeds.
This is the first heavy rainfall in the region during the dry season.
Mixed tropical rainfall is approaching Arizona on Sunday evening and Monday morning, and it will become more extensive on Monday evening and Saturday.
Heavy rain will hit Foor Corner on Saturday and continue through the entire Wednesday.
The United States is expected to experience frequent temperature fluctuations in October as the Arctic gets colder, but the tropics are still quite hot.
Sometimes this causes a sharp temperature difference in nearby areas.
An example of a sharp change in temperature in the central United States during the week.
The temperature difference will be 20 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska, and St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
The summer heat that has remained for the next few days will continue to increase and expand.
The central and eastern United States will be affected by the October mild start of the year, with temperatures spreading from the southern plains to some parts of the northeast.
In New York City, temperatures can reach as high as 80 degrees on Saturday, which is about 10 degrees above average.
Our long-term weather forecast for the first half of October shows a high probability of above-average temperatures in the eastern United States.
Over 20 million people watched the interview
More than 20 million people watched a heartbreaking show on Thursday of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and a woman accusing him of sexual assault allegedly committed in the 1980s, by Christine Blaze Ford, on six television networks.
Meanwhile, political strife continued, with broadcasters suspending programming for Friday's last-minute change: an agreement arranged by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake for the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that he was 100 percent sure Kavanaugh was trying to get his hands dirty and dressed up at a senior party.
Kavanaugh, in an emotional display, said he was 100 percent sure it didn't happen.
It looks like over 20.4 million people watched it, according to a Nielsen report released Friday.
The company counted the average viewership on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel, and MSNBC.
At the time, there was no data available from other networks that were also broadcasting this, including PBS, C-SPAN, and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen also has a hard time figuring out how many people are watching the show in their offices.
And if you look at it objectively, it's the number of people watching football playoffs or the Oscars.
Fox News Channel, whose experts blindly supported Kavanaugh's appointment, leads the way among other channels with an average of 5.69 million viewers a day, Nielsen said.
ABC's ratings were 3.26 million.
CBS had 3.1 million viewers, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million, and CNN had 2.52 million viewers, Nielsen said.
After hearing this, interest remained high.
The main character in Friday's drama was Flake.
After the moderation, the Republican office officially told the press that he was voting in favor of Kavanaugh, CNN and CBS cameras recorded Friday morning when opponents shouted at him for trying to get into the elevator for a legal committee hearing.
He stared for a few minutes before being chatted at, and it was live on CNN.
"I'm standing in front of you", said one woman.
Do you think he's telling the truth to the country?
They told her you had power when so many women were powerless".
Flake said his office issued a statement saying that before the elevator was closed, he could have said more about the committee hearing.
Cable and broadcast networks were broadcasting live after hours when the legal committee had to cast a ballot for Kavanaugh's candidacy for the entire Senate.
But Flake said I'd only do it if I knew the FBI would investigate the charges against the candidate next week that the Democratic minority had made.
Flake was partially convinced when he spoke to his friend, Senator Chris Koons, a Democrat.
After talking to Coon and then several other senators, Blake made a decision.
Flake's choice was powerful because it was clear that Republicans would not vote for Kavanaugh without an investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
UK Prime Minister May is accusing critics of Brexit as a political game.
Prime Minister Theresa May in an interview with the Sunday Times accused critics of her plan to leave the European Union of playing politics and ignoring national interests about Britain's future.
British Prime Minister Theresa May is attending a Conservative Party conference in Birmingham, UK, on 29 September 2018.
While his interview was on the front page of the paper, a second interview was published alongside it, where his former foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, spoke out against his so-called Brexit checker plan, saying that the goal of Britain and the European Union agreeing tariffs on each other is completely absurd.
Wade Sims shot: Police arrested suspected of killing LSU player Yeton Simpson
Police have arrested 20-year-old LSU basketball player Wade Sims on suspicion of fatal shooting.
Yeton Simpson, 20, has been arrested and is serving a life sentence for second-degree murder, the Baton Rouge Police Department said.
The agency released a video of Sims and Simpson's confrontation, police said Sims lost an eye in a fight.
Police recovered the eyepiece and CBS's WAFB reports said it contained Simpson's DNA.
After Simpson was questioned, police said he confessed to accidentally shooting Wade.
His financial liability was set at $350,000, the lawyer said.
The East Baton Rouge Parish Coroner's Office released a preliminary report Friday saying the cause of death was gunshot wounds to his area, specifically the chest.
The department thanks the Louisiana State Police Crime Detection Team, the State Police Criminal Laboratory, the Southern University Police Department and the citizens of the district for their assistance in the investigation that led to the arrest of the perpetrator.
LSU Athletic Director Joe Aleva thanked law enforcement in the region for their thorough and consistent investigation.
Sims was 20 years old.
The 6-foot-6 forward grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for LSU.
Last season, he averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team was devastated and in shock over Wade's death.
Weid always said that he was nervous.
The volcano's peak reached Mexico City
The eruption of the Popocatepetal volcano has reached the southern districts of Mexico City.
On Saturday, after activity reached the crater and 183 gas and oil explosions were recorded over 24 hours, the National Center for Disaster Management warned Mexicans not to approach the volcano.
The center has recorded many crashes and landslides.
Social media images showed a thin layer of paint on a carload of mines in the Ho Chi Minh City neighborhood.
Geophysicists have been looking at the volcano's activity since the 7.1-magnitude earthquake in central Mexico in September 2017, 45 miles (72 km) southeast of the capital.
The volcano, known as Don Goios, has been active since 1994.
Clash between police and Catalan separatists on the anniversary of the independence referendum
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after clashes between pro-independence protesters and law enforcement, with thousands joining the protest to mark the first anniversary of the polarized Catalan vote.
A group of separatist masked men were arrested by law enforcement officers who shot at eggs and onion peels, creating dark clouds of dust on the streets, which are usually crowded with tourists.
The police were also attacked the same day the police used the gloves.
For several hours, independence supporters chanted "Forgetfulness, forgiveness", which was attacked by pro-unity protesters screaming "Long live Spain".
Fourteen people were rescued from minor injuries sustained during the protests, local media reported.
One year after the referendum in Madrid was declared illegal on 1 October, tensions in the region still remain high, with Catalan separatists celebrating an anniversary.
Many people voted for independence, but more opponents of the split boycotted the referendum.
According to Catalan officials, about 1,000 people were injured last year when police tried to stop the current referendum and clashes broke out in the region's constituencies.
Pro-independent groups have been on strike all night on Friday to stop the demonstrations and support the national police.
The ongoing demonstration was forced to continue on a different route.
Nancy Thermes, 68, an electrician, who took part in the separatist protests with her husband, said, "I no longer hope that Catalonia will become independent in the future".
Last year we had our best moments.
I watched my parents cry out for joy because they had the right to vote for independence, but now we're done", she said.
Despite the life-changing, even minor victories in the regional elections last December, pro-independent parties in Catalonia are struggling to keep pace this year, as many of their well-known leaders have either left the country voluntarily or are in jail, and awaiting a court ruling over their role in organising a referendum and the resulting declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who uses her cell phone to protest in support of the police, says the conflict has been fueled by politicians on both sides.
The tension is rising, he said.
Orioles Zanceras, one of nine Catalan leaders awaiting trial, who was arrested last year, announced on Saturday that he would contest the European Parliament elections next year.
Running for the European elections is the best way to declare the decline in democratic values that we have seen from the Spanish authorities", he said.
London: A number of men arrested for hitting a house
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, have been arrested after a car struck a London home again.
The incident occurred at Balinagar Crescent on Thursday, at about 19:30 BST.
According to Detective Inspector Bob Blemings, the glass and the building itself were damaged.
It's possible that at some point, the car was under fire.
The Menga goal gave Livingston a 1-0 win over Rangers
The first goal of Dolly Menga led Livingston to victory.
Livingston, who had been out of the game, forced Rangers to hand over Steven Gerrard for only the second loss in 18 games to manager Ibrox.
Dolly Menga's goal proved the difference, with Harry Holt's team advancing to the second tier with Hibernian.
Gerard's team went undefeated in the Premier League this season, and then next week they face leader Hart, who they're eight points behind.
Meanwhile, Rangers will host Rapid Vienna in the Europa League on Thursday.
Meanwhile, Livingston continues his unbeaten streak in the division for six games, with the head coach still missing a game with a holt after replacing Ken Miller last month.
Livingston never took the chance to meet the Dune guests.
Holt's team had to be promoted long before the goal was scored, their live play in all zones was a problem for Rangers.
Scott Robinson cut well, but the one in front of the door broke the blow, then Alan Litgow could only hit the head through the door of Craig Holkitt's door.
The hosts were happy to give the Rangers a chance to play in front of them, knowing that they would cause trouble for guests from standard situations after the game was updated.
And that was the tactic that made the ball go down.
Rangers gave him a free kick, and Livingston worked on the opening, and Declan Gallagher and Robinson teamed up to deliver the manga, which was touched and scored from the penalty spot.
At that point, the Rangers had the ball-ownership advantage, but the defense was impeccable, and the tough Liam Cale didn't cause any problems.
This continued into the second half, but Alfredo Morello beat and Curry Kelly rescued.
Scott Pittman's batted-in Rangers keeper Alan McGregor won on foot, also beating from a distance to Lithgow in another standard position match against Livingston.
There were constant calls at Livingston Penalty and the ball was always taken out of the penalty box, but two penalties were imposed - after replacing Holkitt with Glenn Middleton and for a second-hand game - both of which were passed.
The "Fenomenal" from Livingston - Analysis
BBC Scotland's Alder Lamont Tony at the Macaroon Arena
Livingston's phenomenal game and score.
All of them, as one, are brilliant players, constantly exceeding expectations on this ascending trajectory.
Their style and lineup has changed significantly since their return to the top flight, but a special thanks to Holt for putting them in the team's custody after his arrival.
He had many heroes.
Captain Holkitt was a disabled, highly organized head of defense, and Menga never gave Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall a break.
In addition, the Ranger was also discouraged.
They're sometimes very good under Gerard, and this time they've cut a lot of ground to that standard.
They didn't score their final ball -- they only got one hit from the home team -- and when the Rangers woke up, they were in the middle of the table.
The first meeting of the Turkish army in Kiev was held in the city of Kiev.
On Saturday, September 29, the leaders of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast in Berlin, and there was a lot of smiles and a lot of blue skies.
It was the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, with the aim of improving relations between NATO members.
They have different views on issues like human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's accession to the European Union.
Then the Erdoğan traveled to Kiev for the opening of a new giant mosque.
This city has the largest number of Turks living outside Turkey.
Police blocked 25,000 people from gathering in front of the mosque for security reasons, but a large number of supporters still gathered nearby to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters - many of them Kurds - also tried to get their voices heard, criticizing Erdogan's policies and the decision by the German authorities to invite him into his country.
The dual protest expresses a different attitude towards the guest, with the German Turks calling him a hero, while the latter calling him an autocrat.
Deptford: A bicycle rider dies after being hit by a car
A cyclist died in a collision involving a car in London.
The collision occurred at the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, Deptford's busy street, southeast of the city, at about 10:15 BST.
The driver of the car stopped and emergency medical services arrived, but the man died on the spot.
The collision occurred on Childer Street a few months after another cyclist died, about a mile from the crash on Saturday.
Metropolitan Police said identification work is underway and will be reported to the immediate family.
The road has been closed and buses have been diverted, and drivers have been advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six officers were wounded in riots
Six prison officers were wounded in the men's prison riots, the prison official said.
The riot began at HMP Long Lartin Prison in Worcestershire at around 09:30 BST on Sunday and continues to this day.
Special Forces have been called to the storm to resolve the situation involving eight prisoners and taking place in one wing of the prison.
Officers were called to the scene for medical attention for minor injuries.
The prison press secretary said that a specially trained prison staff is involved in the ongoing unrest at HMP Long Larin.
Six employees were treated for injuries.
We're not in favor of prison violence, we're making it clear that the perpetrators are turned over to the police and they're going to have to wait longer to get away with it.
HMP Long LaTine has more than 500 inmates, including some of the most feared criminals in the country.
As the report states, in June, the prison warden was hospitalized after the prisoner committed suicide.
And last October, law enforcement officers were called to prison for a serious riot in which they attacked their employees with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rose threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City with flash flooding (which may be helpful in the future)
Tropical depression rarely strikes Arizona, but this is what's going to happen early next week, as the remaining energy from Hurricane Rosa moves to the desert southwest, likely to be followed by flash floods.
The National Weather Service has already announced flash flood watches on Monday and Saturday in western Arizona, southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, as well as the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to pick up gas directly towards Phoenix on Saturday, with rain approaching late Monday.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix tweeted that only 40 tropical cyclones have maintained tropical storm or depression status 200 km from Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane 40 miles from the Arizona border".
The latest models from the National Hurricane Center suggest a 2 to 4 inch nalex, with an isolated 6 inch Arizona logo in Rim.
The wilderness in other areas of the Southwest, including the Central Rock and Great Basin, is likely to be 1 or 2 inches, while total insulation can be up to 4 inches.
For those at risk of sudden flooding, the rain of the rose can be beneficial because the region is very clear.
Although flooding is a serious concern, some heavy rainfall is likely to be beneficial, as the southwest is currently in the drier weather.
Of the United States Weather Bureau, 40 percent of Arizona is in extreme weather, the second highest category.
Hurricane Rosa is tracking Mexico on the Bay Area in California.
Rosa, still a strong storm on Sunday morning, with maximum sustained winds of 85 mph, is 385 miles south of Punta Eugaña and is moving north at 12 mph.
The storm is interacting with the cold waters of the Pacific Ocean and is therefore calming down.
Thus, the storm is expected to make landfall in Mexico after midnight or on Monday night.
Heavy rainfall in parts of Mexico can be very severe, with severe flooding.
Total 3-6 inches of rainfall is expected in northwestern Sanora Bay, California, with up to 10 inches of rainfall, weather.com reports.
The Rose then travels north through Mexico in the form of tropical rain before reaching the Arizona border in the early hours of Saturday as a tropical depression, which then moves into Arizona and reaches southern Utah late Saturday night.
The main threat from the storm or its debris is very heavy rainfall in northwestern Sonora Bay, California and the desert regions of the United States, the National Hurricane Center says.
These rains are expected to be followed by life-threatening flash floods and landslides in the desert, as well as landslides in the mountainous region.
Midsomer Norton attack: Four people arrested for murder
Three teenage boys and a 20-year-old man have been arrested for the murder of a 16-year-old with multiple stab wounds on his body, which was discovered in a throat.
A young boy was found injured on a high terrace in Midsomer Norton County at about 4:00 a.m. on Saturday.
He was taken to the hospital, where his condition is stable.
According to police in Avon and Somerset, two 17-year-olds, 18-year-olds and 20-year-olds were arrested the night before at Redstock's bars.
Police have contacted and contacted anyone who may have a complaint from any phone recording about what happened and what happened during the events.
As Trump has said, Kavanaugh is grieving over the pride and anger of the Democratic Party.
"The voice for Kavanaugh is a voice for the Democratic Party's brutal and overwhelming tactics", Trump said at a meeting in Willing, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh has been harassed and influenced by the Democratic Party during his nomination process.
Before being presented to Congress on Thursday, Kavanaugh denied all the evidence presented by Christina Blaise Ford, who allegedly sexually assaulted her ten years ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also gave a testimony at the hearing.
On Saturday, the president said that "the American people have seen the beauty, the quality and the purpose" of Kavanaugh.
"Every vote given to the Kavanaugh is a vote of confidence for one of the greatest civil figures of our time, to serve in the courtroom with record of accomplishments in civil service", he told supporters in West Virginia.
The president also spoke quietly about Kavanaugh's nomination when he spoke about the state of the Republican Party in the midterm elections.
"We're only about five weeks away from the most important decisions of our lives.
I didn't seem to buy the ball, but actually, it turns out I did", he said.
"That's why, in every place, I will fight to the end for these wonderful candidates".
Trump said the current primary mission of the Democrats is to stop the president and resist him".
The first preliminary vote on Kavanaugh's nomination will be held in the Senate chamber no later than next Friday, a GOP aide told CNN.
Hundreds of people died in the earthquake, tsunami, and huge rising waves in Indonesia.
On Saturday, state officials said at least 384 people died in the disaster, many of them hit by massive waves, while a powerful tsunami and earthquake damaged the Indonesian island of Sulawesi.
Thousands of people gathered at the beach of Palo on Friday when waves of 18 feet [6.0 m] high struck the beach, killing many people and destroying everything they could find.
The tsunami was followed by a 7.5-magnitude earthquake.
"When the tsunami first struck yesterday, people did not run away and were stranded on the beach again, becoming victims of the disaster", said the spokesman for the Indonesian Disaster Organization, Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, at a briefing in Jakarta.
"In this case, not only was there no place for the tsunami, it was carrying cars, logs, houses and everything else along the way", said Nuqrohom, noting that before the damage to the coast was done, the tsunami was traveling at a speed of 800 km/h (497 mph).
He claimed to have even moved some trees to save himself, and that method was justified.
About 16,700 people were evacuated from 24 different Palos centers.
Documentary footage released by the Emergency Management Agency showed many buildings, shops, and bridges that were damaged by the disaster, as well as a mosque surrounded by a large amount of water.
Then, there was the coastal town on a Sunday.
Seismic series occurred in an area of 2.4 million people.
The BPPT said that the energy released during the disasters was 200 times greater than the atomic bombing of Hiroshima during World War II.
In terms of the geographical location of the city, it is located along the coast, which may have contributed to the increased damage caused by the disaster.
Nughroho called the incident "large-scale" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels were destroyed.
The bodies of the victims were found in the ruins of the destroyed buildings, but he added that 540 people were injured in the accident, and 29 are still being sought.
Nugrohom also said that the casualties and damage could have been greater in the northern outskirts of Palo Alto, 300 kilometers (190 miles) from the city, in the Dongla area, where the epicenter of the earthquake was located.
Communication was "completely limited in terms of information transmission" between the donegal and other sources, said Nugroho.
300,000 people live in these areas", the Red Cross said, adding that volunteers and staff were heading to the scene.
"It's a tragedy, but it could have been worse", they said.
On Saturday, the agency was under considerable criticism for providing unusual information about the disaster that hit the city of Palos, with authorities saying that the waves had reached another city while the letter of alarm was still fresh.
On social media, you can see a man on the roof trying to warn people and give them a voice about the coming waves.
Within minutes, a huge stream of water washed up on the beach, taking away buildings and cars.
The news agencies were unable to take appropriate action in time.
The earthquake and tsunami damaged the city-to-city source of water and made it virtually impossible for officials to share information.
Soldiers have started sending emergency aircraft to the disaster area from Jakarta and other cities, but the victims still need food and other basic necessities.
The city's airport has been reopened for emergency use only and will return to normal operations only in October.
President Joko Widodo is planning a visit to the Palo Alto evacuation center this week.
The tsunami in Indonesia has reached a height of over 800 feet.
This is very bad.
Mr. Doseb said that as World Vision staff were traveling from Donggala to Palus, they had to see increasing scenes and locations before reaching the special areas designated for defense.
He said that "they saw a lot of houses destroyed by the disaster".
This is very bad.
Although various local relief organizations have started their activities and carried out various relief work or operations, several similar foreign organizations have been banned from entering the Palos areas.
Under Indonesian regulations, co-financing, assistance or support can only enter the country if it is recognized as an international disaster area and acquires similar status.
It hasn't happened yet.
"It is still a low level of non-emergency disaster", said Auliya Aryan, a spokesperson for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"As soon as the government declares it's a national disaster, we can get international aid, but we haven't received a message yet".
The following night, after the earthquake and tsunami of Friday, the friends and family of the missing continued to hope with a heart full of hope that their loved ones still had a chance to survive, and that the dark traces left by the natural disaster would not remain forever in their lives.
On Saturday, a little boy was pulled from a drainage ditch.
On Sunday, rescuers rescued a woman who had been trapped for two days under the rubble, next to her mother's body.
Jendon Subandono, coach of the Indonesian parachute team, was training two missing pilots to compete in the upcoming Asian Games in Indonesia this month.
Other people who had been trapped in the ruins of the Ro Ro Roas Hotel turned out to be his disciples.
"As a parachutist, I have my emotional boundaries", he said.
Mr. Gendon said how quickly, within hours, the events at the Roa Roa Hotel spread to the paraplane flying community, sending desperate messages via WhatsApp to the participants at the Polo that were attending the beach festival.
However, only one blue mark appeared on his text, not two blue ones.
'I think that means they didn't get the message,' he said.
The thieves stole $26,750 when they filled a bank in Newport, Missouri.
According to the Newport Police Department's news team, thieves were able to steal $26,750 from the seamen who were filling the ATM at the time on Friday.
The driver was cleaning the ATM and setting up a seat for more money, Detective Dennis McCarthy told the news.
While the driver was busy with his mission, another "went to the border guard" and stole a bag full of money to be transported.
Witnesses have spotted several suspects involved in the ongoing trial, but according to the press release, the police have not specified the number of people out.
Any person with information about the identity of the suspect should contact the Newport Police at 859-292-3680.
Kenny West: The rapper's new name is Ye
Rapper Ken West is changing his name to Ye.
He tweeted about the change on Saturday, "I'm formally known as Kenny West".
West, 41, was nicknamed Ye for a while, and he used that name for his eighth album, which was released in June.
In addition, Saturday's live performance is expected to see Ken's different visuals, which is where his new album, Yandhi, is expected to be released.
The show's host said he's replacing Alan Grande, who declined to speak because of "emotional background".
In addition to having the current professional name, which is a bit of an abbreviation for Ken, West said the word has religious value to him.
"I believe 'ye' is the most frequently used word in the Bible, and it means 'you' in the Bible", Ken said in an interview this year when he was discussing the title of his album with Big Boy on the radio.
"I am you, I am us, this is us.
From Kenye, which means only Yours, the name has become Ye-D -- an anarchy of our good, our bad, our mess and everything.
The album is largely anorexic of who we are.
He's one of the famous rappers who changed his name.
Sin Combs is known for names like Puff Daddy, P. Diddy, or Daddy, but this year he announced that he preferred the names Love and Brother Love.
And the former Western collaborator, Jay-Z, emphasized the need for capital letters and a deff in his name.
AMLO Mexico has sworn to refrain from using military force against civilians.
Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has vowed to abstain from military force against civilians as the country approaches the 50th anniversary of the bloody crackdown on students.
Lopez Obrador promised the people at a meeting in Tlatelolco Plaza on Saturday that he would "never use military force to repress the Mexican people".
On October 2, 1968, soldiers attacked civilians, killing 300 left-wing activists, who had roots throughout Latin America.
Lopez Obrador promised young people monthly grants and the opening of new public universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities are driving young people into the criminal world.
The U.S. needs to double its funding for AI.
Kai-Fu Li, an AI inventor and practitioner with experience working for companies like Google, Microsoft and Apple, said that as China becomes more active in AI, the United States should double the amount of money spent on research.
This commentary was published after various parts of the US government made a statement about AI, highlighting the fact that the US does not have a formal strategy on the subject.
And China, meanwhile, just last year presented its plan: It plans to become the number one AI country by 2030.
"Doubling research funding would be a good start for America, given how far behind other countries are in this regard from the United States, and we expect more new developments", Lee said.
Doubling the money will further increase the chance that the next new discovery will be in America based on artificial intelligence, Lee said in an interview with CNBC this week.
Lee, whose book "The Superpowers of Artificial Intelligence: China, the Silk Road, and the New World", was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, a company that has invested in one of China's largest AI-focused organizations.
In the 1980s, he worked on AI systems that beat America's top players at Carnegie Mellon University, and later served as the CEO of Microsoft Research and president of Google's China subsidiary.
Lee sympathized with the U.S. government's previous technology competitions, such as the Defense Systems Robot Competition, and wondered when the next such event would be held to better picture the future.
Lee said that in America, researchers often need a lot of work to be able to get grants.
"China is not attracting academic leaders; it is attracting corporations", he said.
Facebook, Google, and other tech companies are hiring successful people from universities to work with them on AI.
Lee also said immigration reforms could also help develop artificial intelligence.
"I think we should automatically give green cards to people with a PhD in artificial intelligence", he said.
The State Consulate of China presented its plan for the development of the next generation of artificial intelligence in July 2017.
Li noted that the China Science Foundation funds academic scientists, like government agencies, and that funding is available to U.S. citizens, but the quality of research is still lower in China.
Recently, the United States Department of Defense has created a United Artificial Intelligence Center to bring together people from industry and academia. The White House has also announced its readiness to form an AI committee and select its members.
DARPA also announced a $2 billion investment they plan to make in a project called AI Next.
And for NSF, DAPRA invests $100 million a year in AI.
Yet the US legislature, which called for a Security Committee to be set up on the basis of artificial intelligence, has not taken any action this month.
Macedonians will participate in a referendum on changing the country's name
On Sunday, the Macedonians took part in a referendum in which they expressed their desire to change the name of their country to the "Republic of North Macedonia", a move similar to the one that would resolve the decades-long conflict between Macedonia and Greece that has prevented Macedonia from joining the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which owns the province of Macedonia, has said that Macedonia is claiming Greek territory in its name, which has led to Greece vetoing Macedonia's entry into NATO and the EU.
Representatives of the two countries agreed to change the name in July, but nationalist opponents say such an action would erode Macedonian Slavic origins and cost them their lives.
President Georgy Ivanov has said he will not participate in the referendum, thus declaring a boycott and siding with those who are trying to break the 50 percent barrier.
The referendum bulletin asked the following question: "Do you want to join NATO and the European Union through an agreement with Greece?"
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, said that this was the price to pay to join the EU and NATO, as Macedonia was one of the countries formed as a result of the collapse of Yugoslavia.
"I came here today to vote for the future of our country, to vote for the young people who can live in peace under the umbrella of the European Union, because that means being safer for all of us", said 79-year-old Olga Georgijeva, of Skopje.
Despite the lack of legal connections, MPs said they would wait for the election results and see if the number of votes would become crucial for the country.
The change of the name of the country from Parliament would require more than two-thirds of the vote.
The Election Commission said no reports were recorded as of 1 p.m.
However, only 16 percent of the population has been announced at this time, which is significantly lower than the 2016 election, when 34 percent of the population had already been announced and 66 percent finally expressed their opinion on the newsletter.
"I came here to vote for my children, our place is in Europe", said Jose Taniewski, 62, a voter from the capital, Skopje.
The Prime Minister of Macedonia, Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Dusko, have supported the name change for Macedonia, which will pave the way for the country to join NATO and the European Union, Macedonia on September 30, 2018.
At that time in Skopje, in front of Parliament, Vladimir Kavardaikov, 54, was setting up a small stage, bringing chairs and putting them in front of tents for those who opposed the referendum.
"We want NATO and the EU, but we want to unite these organizations on a head-on basis, not at the expense of help from others.
"We are a poor country, but we feel dignity.
If they don't want us to be accepted as Macedonia, we can join Russia and China and become members of the Eurasian Union".
Prime Minister Zaev said that integration into NATO would bring more investment benefits to Macedonia, a country with a high unemployment rate of over 20 percent.
"I believe that the majority will make this choice because 80 percent of the country is in favor of NATO and EU integration", Zaev said in his newsletter.
He said that "yes" would be a result that "confirms our future".
According to a poll published last Monday by the Macedonian Research Institute, 30 to 43 percent of the population will participate in the referendum - which is not enough.
According to a second survey conducted by Macedonian Telma TV, 57 percent of the population plan to vote on Sunday.
And 70 percent of respondents say they're going to vote yes to the referendum.
It takes 50 percent plus one vote to get a referendum through.
The referendum defeat represents one of the biggest shortcomings of the pro-Western government, which came to power in May last year.
See: Manchester City player Sergio Aguero manages to maneuver the defence of Brighton to score.
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling quickly beat the defending champions of Brighton in a match on Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England, and ended in a 2-0 win over Manchester City.
Augusto presented scoring for an opponent as a relatively simple task in the 65th minute of the game.
The Argentine striker got the ball in the middle of the field.
He slipped through the three players of the Brigton defense before he was out in the open.
After that, Aguero was surrounded by four green jerseys.
He pushed one of the guards before he could train the others and found himself on a 12-inch belt.
After that, he handed the ball over to Sterling.
The first touch was used by the Stirling to return the ball to Augusto, and Augusto was able to use his right foot to score for the right corner of the goal for the goalkeeper Matthew Ryan of Brighton.
"Aguirre has foot problems", said the club's coach, Pep Guardiola, to reporters.
"We were planning to give him 55, 60 minutes of playing time.
And that's what happened.
We were lucky that he was able to score at this point".
But it was Sterling who managed to give the Blues a lead in the Premier League.
His goal came in the 29th minute.
Auguro earned the ball in halftime at Brighton.
He did a great performance under Leroy Sane.
Sanne touched the ball several times before he was sent to Sterling.
The Blue's forward has hit the ball more times than he has put it in the opponent's door.
In the Champions League group stage, City will face Hofheim and play Saturday at 12:55 p.m. at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Schenectady, Germany.
The watchman wants to play Spoiler vs. Rockies.
After I left the Nationals playoffs, there was not much point in starting over.
But, always a competitive shooter, he hopes his team can win against the Colorado Rockies this week, only if the Rockies are still in the playoffs, and have a one-game lead over the Los Angeles Dodgers in the Western Conference Baseball Championship.
Friday night, the Rockies won 5-2 against the Nationals in a tight game, but they still want their first division title.
"While we're playing for nothing, at least we can get the most out of the field and know that with the atmosphere created by the Denver fans and the team, we can create the highest level of play that's on the map this year.
Why should you not want to participate in such a contest?
The Nationals' starting lineup has yet to be announced for the week, but in that case, the pitcher will definitely be in the starting lineup.
This will be Schesser's 34th start, as he was out of the bullpen on Thursday, which is why he's going to be pitcher of the week.
The Washington right-hander has a record of 18-7, 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings.
Trump is running a stock market in West Virginia.
President Al-Muzer spoke about the events surrounding Brett Kavanaugh in the Supreme Court when he spoke about the state of the Republican Party in the midterm elections.
"Everything we've done will be done in November.
We're only five weeks away from the most important choices in our lives.
It's one of the biggest, biggest events -- it's like I didn't get the ball, but I did, and that's why I'm trying everywhere to fight for these great candidates", he said.
Trump also added, "You see the horrible, horrible groups of Democrats, and you're watching all this right now.
They're trying to take power back with all their might, and you see that cruelty and filth.
They don't care who they hurt, who they pass on, what matters is that they gain power and control, that's what they want power and control, and we're not going to give it up for them".
He said the current primary mission of the Democrats is to "contain and resist".
"And you see that in the last four days", he said, and responded to the Democrats, "how brazilian, rude and unreasonable they are".
He also addressed the Senate Judiciary Committee, and the Democratic Senator Dean Feinstein, who earned a pretty loud response from the audience.
"Do you remember his answer?
You've been leaked from official documents?
Uh, uh, what?
No, no, no, no, no, no. It was the worst body language gesture I've ever seen".
Work will no longer lose the church.
He's intolerant of people who say what they think.
When the activists of my party's driving force voted for my censorship, I was very surprised.
After all, I'm the last member of the Labour MP list they don't want to accept - and that's all just because I'm talking about what I think.
My colleague in parliament, Joan Ryan, deserved a similar response because she was a strong opponent of anti-Semitism.
In my case, the censorship movement criticized Jeremy Corbyn for his disagreements.
Jeremy didn't agree with leaders before on issues like responsible economic policies for public sector agencies, Europe and the like.
A letter from the East Nottingham meeting said: "We want the meeting to be inclusive and productive".
After eight years as a local MP, this Friday night meeting was just like that for me.
Unfortunately, today's meetings don't sound like that, and the policy of "good and kind" has been forgotten if anything like it has ever existed.
It is quite clear that there is a very intolerant attitude within the Labour Party towards different views, and that each view is only criticized based on whether the party leaders agree with it.
It started shortly after Jeremy became the leader, as a colleague, and he expected me to change my mind completely on different issues and take a position I would never have agreed to in my life -- go on the subject of state defense, go on the subject of EU unilateral trade.
When I speak publicly -- whatever that means -- there's a lot of violence going on on social media about calling for early elections, breaking up the political center, and leaving my party.
And it's not just my experience.
On the contrary, I feel lucky because some of the comments I've made are political.
I appreciate the professionalism and hard work of colleagues who hear sexist or racist calls every day, but never run away from them.
In today's politics, it's disappointing that this kind of violence has become normal for us.
Jeremy Cronin said last week that the Labour Party should embrace a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we no longer resemble the church, and every "unstable" step or change in the inner workings of the party makes it even smaller.
I've had quite a few tips over the last two years to keep my head down, not to raise my voice, and only in this case, "Everything would be fine".
But that's not what I came into politics for.
Since I became a member of the Labour Party 32 years ago as a student, and this decision was driven by Thatcher's policies that affected the classroom system, I've set myself the goal of serving those in the civil service sector who need it most - whether as a local representative or as a government minister.
I've never hidden my politics, not even in the last election.
In East Nottingham, it is impossible for anyone to be confused about my political position and the disagreements I had with the ruling party at the time.
To those of you who took the lead at Friday's meeting, the only thing that I'm hoping to say is that when your country is heading for Brexit, which can damage real estate, business and civil services, I don't see why you should want to spend time and energy on such a loyal attitude towards a Labour Party leader.
But one message I have is not for the members of the Nottingham Movement, but for my colleagues, the Labour Party and others: I am proud to be able to serve you, and I promise you, no threat or bad political intention will stop me from doing what I believe is in your best interests.

Eyre 38-17 Melrose: The undefeated Eyre topped the table
The last two games could have had some effect on the outcome, but there's no doubt that Erie deserved the triumph that this team has achieved in the Premier League with today's game.
They're currently at the top of the table, the only undefeated team out of ten.
It was their good defense and their chances that eventually led the team to a dominant position at home, which is why they were able to make coach Peter Marsh a pleasure.
"In every game we've tested our abilities, and we're still unbeaten, so I have to be happy", he said.
"Honor to Ayr, they took advantage of the opportunity better than we did", said Robin Christian of Melrose.
In the 14th minute, Grant Anderson's attempt by Frazier Clemos led the Ayr team to the finish, but for Scottish captain Horry Hugh, the yellow card gave the Warriors a wide margin and allowed Melrose and Jason Begot a chance.
After that, Climax was able to increase the lead of Ayr by penalties, just before the end of the first half, and made the score 17-5.
Melrose got off to a pretty good start in the second half, which is why, with Patrick Anderson's effort and Bagot's finishing, they were able to cut the lead to five points.
This was followed by a serious injury to the Rward Knott, who had to leave the field, but Ayr was still able to make the distance and climb the transition thanks to McDowall.
Active Air Captain Blair McPherson earned the yellow card again, which led Melrose to make a failed attempt to convert players through a large press.
At home, the players were able to play the game, and when Struan Hutchison earned a yellow card to hit the cliff, McPherson was able to score a touchdown and lead Eyre Mole.
Climom was able to turn the ball around, and he was able to do it every time, every time, since Kyle Rowe sent David Armstrong's pitcher a cookie to Gregor Henry, the fifth time the players had come home.
The TV series, solid game star is preparing to establish himself in a restaurant career.
The hardcore star Ford Kieran is about to move into the hospitality industry, and this story has been spread after he was named the manager of a licensed restaurant company.
Jack Carviss, 56, stars in the popular BBC comedy series, where he writes and collaborates with longtime comedy partner Greg Hampfield.
The duo has announced that the ninth series is the final one for the series, and it appears that Kearnan will be making a number of changes after the Kreiglange.
According to official sources, he is the owner of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment, but a Scottish source reports that Kearney is planning to join Glasgow's "restaurant trading industry".
'The sea is ours': Bolivia, in the midst of a tumult, hopes to be released to the Pacific Ocean
The Marines are patrolling the Ridge-Clad administration in La Paz.
The public institutions are lit by dark blue flags.
The shipyards from Tikitaka to the Amazon have a motto: "The sea is ours.
It's our duty to bring him back".
Bolivia's closure is the result of the 19th Saxon conflict that ended in bloodshed with Chile, a conflict that still plagues the Pacific.
Five years after the trial, Bolivia is eagerly awaiting the International Court of Justice's ruling, which is scheduled for October 1.
"Bolivia has an impulse, a sense of unity and purity, and of course, a positive response", said Roberto Calzadaila, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians are going to go live to the international courtroom, and of course most of them believe that decades from now, Chile will be tasked with negotiating with the country and going to sea.
Evo Morales, the charismatic Bolivian president who is running for office next year, also has a say in Monday's procession.
"We are very close to the return of the Pacific", he said last August.
But some analysts think that the chances of a decision in favor of Bolivia are very low, and if it were, it would change a lot.
One of the United Nations' centers, based in the Netherlands, has no influence on Chile, and said that their intervention would have no influence on the negotiations.
The International Court of Justice said the verdict was due within six months of the final hearing, meaning the case was not "closed", said Paz Zarate, a Chilean expert on international law.
And the improvement in Bolivia may have slowed down over the last four years.
"The case of the return of the ship was referred to the Bolivian administration", Zarate said.
Bolivia's military spirit may even reduce Chile's last drop of goodwill, he said.
Bolivia and Chile will start negotiations at some point, but it's going to be a pretty tough thing to continue after all this.
The two countries have not had ambassadors to each other since 1962.
Former Bolivian president and country's representative to The Hague, Eduardo Rodriguez Veltz, rejected the view that the court's process was unusually fast.
Monday will give Bolivia a chance to "explore new opportunities for new relations with Chile" and give it a chance "to resolve a 139-year dispute by satisfying both sides", he said.
Caldalí also denied that Morales, one of Latin America's most popular presidents, had used the conflict as a political lever.
"Bolivia will never bet on the opportunity to travel to the Pacific", he added.
"The return of the past is a chance to prove that we're out of the past".
North Korea has said it will not begin its nuclear disarmament process until it trusts America.
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-hoon has said they will never arm a nuclear weapon unless they trust Washington.
The United Nations General Assembly was convened on Saturday.
He called on the United States to honor the pledges made at the Singapore summit between the two rival countries.
Of course, the United States has commented on his remarks. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is on the verge of renewing talks with Kim Jong-un that began in Singapore three months ago.
Lee says the U.S. sanctions and the declaration of an end to the war with Korea are a "zero dream" for North Korea to leave.
Washington plans to agree to the declaration before the Fenian takes the first step toward disarmament.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump want a second summit.
On the other hand, there is a common skepticism that the Fenian is seriously considering refusing to take up arms because it is the only way to peace.
Pompeo plans to visit Fenian next month to prepare for the second Kim Trump summit.
The Paris Fashion Show will showcase the latest collection of massive shelters that could cover your streets.
If you want to increase the size of your helmet, or to protect your body completely from the sun, don't go far.
Designers Valentino and Tom Brown have unveiled a huge and bizarre set of dolls for their SS19 collection, which has taken the Paris style to the forefront of this week's fashion week.
The extremely uncomfortable streets have covered the entire Instagram world this summer, and designers are still watching the trend from a distance.
The demo version was made by Valentino, and the details inside it dropped a massive bubble that completely covered the models' heads.
Other huge accessories included a sliced ice cream, a witch's tail and pineapple - but their main purpose is not to keep your head warm.
Tom Brown also published his collection of weird masks just as Halloween was coming to the door.
Most of them are completely covered in touchbags and show a cannibal reader rather than a representative of the fashion world.
One creature lost its goat's clothing, its swimming glasses and fins, when the other was shaped like a frozen ice.
And if you keep up with the trend of huge things, you're lucky.
Stylist experts suggest that the huge bonnets may even cover the streets near you.
The huge boots in the collection are high-end La Bomba shoes, which have a two-foot upper bound and can be seen on people like Ryan and Emily Ratayakovsky.
The cult creatures, in the form of huge boots that completely covered social media, laid the foundation for a new creature on the podium -- a long beach bag that's as big as the model that wears it.
The dark orange raffle bag, saturated with raffle headings and bearing a white wool design, is part of Jacquemus' La Riviera SS19 collection from Paris Fashion Week.
Famous facial stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: "I expect the big streets and beaches to be busy for next summer - because the designer has had such an impact, it's going to be very difficult to ignore and ignore demand.
John Edward: Knowing foreign languages is an important skill for global citizens
The Scottish Association of Independent Schools monitors academic achievement, and they will continue to do so in 2018, focusing on good academic performance, which has recently strengthened in sports, arts, music and other social sectors.
The Schools are represented by the 30,000 pupils represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), and they are always committed to providing the highest level of service to pupils and parents.
Independent schools try to prepare their students for higher education, their chosen careers, and their ability to become global citizens.
As an education sector that is able to produce the right curriculum in schools, we see foreign languages as the most popular and sought-after subject to be chosen in schools in the future.
Nelson Mandela said: "When you speak to a person in a language they understand, what you say is directly reflected in their mind.
If you speak in his mother tongue, the words go straight to his heart".
It reminds us once again that we cannot rely solely on English when we try to build relationships and trust with people from different countries.
Among independent schools, it is clear from the results of the last years that foreign languages are the most successful in their respective fields.
68 percent of foreign language learners earned the highest A.
According to data collected from 74 schools in SCIS, 72 percent of students earned the highest marks in Chinese, while 72 percent of students in German, 69 percent of students in French, and 63 percent of students in Spanish also earned the highest marks.
This reflects once again the fact that independent schools in Scotland support the development of foreign languages as the most important skill for children's future.
Languages are now being given as much attention as STEM (science, technology, engineering, math) subjects in independent schools and elsewhere.
A 2014 UK employment survey found that 17 percent of applicants were reluctant to apply because of language barriers.
Therefore, more and more attention is being paid to foreign languages to prepare young people for future careers.
In a global world, the more jobs are available in different languages, the more demand for these skills is rising.
Regardless of what career choice you make, if you learn a second language, you will have a real advantage in the future in acquiring a skill that will always be useful.
Communicating with people of another nationality in their native language always helps them to get ahead in terms of employment.
According to a YouGov survey of 4,000 British teenagers in 2013, 75 percent could not communicate in any other language, and 15 percent could only have a simple conversation in French.
And now that language learning is important to our children, we're investing more in it.
Learning several languages, especially in developing economies, will equip children with skills that will be essential for their employment.
In Scotland, each school will be different depending on the foreign language classes.
Part of the schools will focus on popular classical languages, while the second part will focus on languages that will be important to the UK by 2020, and those languages are Chinese or Japanese.
Whatever your child's interests may be, there will always be a language that will interest him and enable him to learn from experienced staff and professionals.
The Scottish Independent Schools Association aims to create the right learning environment for children and to equip them with all the skills they need in the future.
No one can deny that foreign languages play a huge role in the economic development of a country, and that should be included in education.
Moreover, foreign languages should be considered as "a necessary skill for international communication".
Independent schools will continue to offer students choice, diversity and excellence.
It has to be done.
John Edward is the Director of Independent Schools in Scotland
LeBron's Lakers debut came in San Diego.
Fans are eagerly awaiting the arrival of LeBron James as a first-round pick of the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that LeBron will play Denver Nuggets in a preseason game Sunday in San Diego.
But how long he'll play is still unknown.
"The number of times you'll be playing is going to be more than one and less than 48", Walton said on the Lakers' official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudeau tweeted that James is likely to play for a limited time.
Last week, in practice, James was asked about his plans for the preseason games.
"I don't need pre-season games to train at this point in my career", he said.
Trump's speech in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump is launching a campaign series today in Willing, West Virginia.
This is Trump's first of five meetings scheduled for next week, and he's going to be following up with destinations like Tennessee and Mississippi.
The letter requesting the Supreme Court to file a petition confirms Trump is going to create support for midterm elections because Republicans are at risk of losing control of Congress in November.
What time is Trump's meeting in West Virginia, and how can we watch it online?
Trump's Willing West Virginia meeting is scheduled for 7:00 p.m. today, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump's speech live via the YouTube link below.
It's likely that at this meeting, Trump will nominate Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh, who has been embroiled in a sexual violence-related conflict over the past few days that the Federal Bureau of Investigation is investigating.
But the Republicans' main goal in these meetings is to gain some confidence in the November election.
Accordingly, the Trump campaign office said the next five meetings will be aimed at "strengthening volunteerism and support as Republicans seek to protect and strengthen the majors in the Senate and House", Reuters said.
"Control over Congress is crucial because the president has a plan to get as many states as possible during the busy election campaign", said a Trump campaign spokesman who denied calling himself Reuters.
According to Metro News of West Virginia, this meeting, which will be held at Westbank Stadium in Willing, may attract supporters from "Ohio and Pennsylvania, and it will be covered by the Pittsburgh media".
Last month, next Saturday, Trump visits West Virginia, a state where he won more than 40 percent of the vote in 2016.
Trump is trying to help West Virginia Republican Senate candidate Patrick Morrissey, whose results vary in the polls.
"It's not a good sign for Morrissey when the president goes to him to get his support", said Simon Heather, a political scientist at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA hopefully prepares to head to the weekly individual tournament
After three one-off seasons, the four-man race on Saturday night may be what the Ryder Cup has been looking for so long.
The variability of momentum and fate is a perfectly imaginary model in sports, but athletes still hope for it, especially in a competition like the Ryder Cup.
What the hell are they gonna say now, where's their momentum?
"We had a six-hour lead, and now we have four, so we're going to take that as a small boost", Jordan Spit said of his trip to the destination today.
Of course, Europe has the advantage, you have four extra points and a chance to score another 12.
Americans, Spit says, feel that they're bothered by a very small sense of fear because they have a very high motivation before the game, and that's reflected in the level of play of Spit and Justin Thomas, who trained together and scored three out of four points.
Spit was a failure on the court, and that's what he's leading on.
The opening round was even louder, as Thomas and Spit scored two points in the second.
His 15th victory in the event was also called a similar victory, indicating that the Americans were not going to be out of the championship.
"The only thing that's bothering you is to focus and worry about your game", Spit said.
That's what's left for every player right now.
There's 18 more to go.
The only players with more points on the spit and Thomas are Francesco Molinari and Tom Fleetwood, the rival story from the Ryder Cup.
Europe doesn't have much of a lead, but a great couple dropped four out of four and can't beat it.
Hollywood is the only place where they didn't shoot a boxer on a Saturday night, they shot a boxer on a Saturday morning, and they did it on a Friday night and at 9:00 a.m.
From the meeting, and from the energy that both players have, it's clear that it's not funny to the viewer that no player can cover a European victory and the sun will necessarily set on Le Golf National or Molinari.
Maybe both, but at different depths.
But it's still too late to talk about European greatness.
Bubba Watson and Webb Wimpson did a little work from Sergio Garcia, the morning four-legged hero who teamed up with Alex Noren.
The Spaniard scored a double and the Swede scored a double and they've never been this close to a lead.
But on Sunday, no one can help you get out of your body.
Quadrangles and couples are very interesting to watch, as you watch the relationships of couples, the advice they give each other, and the strategy that may change in a moment.
Europe did play a much better game as a team and they had a remarkable lead for the last day, but the American team showed that they had a fighting perspective and they weren't going to stand aside, so everything was still questionable.
Europe leads 10-6 for the final day of the Ryder Cup
Europe will have a big lead on the final day after beating the United States 10-6 in the final on Saturday.
Tom Fleetwood and the duo of Francisco Molinar won the Tiger Woods, who was desperately trying to get a pair at Le Golf National.
Thomas Bayonne, from Europe, is doubtful he can recover the trophy he won two years ago, as Europe dominated America in the morning match, a 3-1 win.
The United States needs even more resilience, and despite two victories, it cannot reach its goal.
Jim Farry's team needs eight points from 12 games a week to win the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to win four times since he and Molinari won the Moliwood and came close to winning the Ryder Cup.
After defeating Woods and Patrick Reed, their main goal is to defeat American rookie Bryson DeCambeau with a 5&4 lead.
Despite an unusual performance on Saturday, Woods has 19 losses in 29 games, losing seven in a row.
Justin Rose is a free agent for the Morning Star, and he represents partner Henrik Stenson, who defeated 2&1 alongside Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka in the World Series - the number one and third-place players.
In the sluggish southwest of Paris, Europe really didn't have easy games.
The three-time winners, Jordan Spit and Justin Thomas, set a two-point line after Saturday's game against the Americans.
They earned a 2&1 win against Spaniard John Ram and Ian Poulter and then returned to beat Poulter and Rory McLaurie 4&3, where the pair lost the first two crucial 20s.
In the history of the game, only two times have a team made a comeback from a four-way tie, and it's also worth noting that only a match of points is needed by the Fury team to win.
After two days of being at the top, we're expecting more than a week of counter-attacks.
North Korea says it will not disarm unilaterally without confidence
Speaking to the United Nations, North Korea's foreign minister said the sanctions would create even more distrust of the United States and would not disarm at that point.
Ri Yong-Hom told the World General Assembly that China has taken "smart steps" over the past few years and stopped testing nuclear and military weapons, further studying them, and vowed not to spread nuclear weapons and nuclear technology further.
"But we don't see any response or action from the United States", he said.
"Without the United States of America, we cannot be confident in our national security, and we will not be the first to arm our country under such conditions".
When Ri made a statement about what they were going to resist in America's current "phase", his statement seemed to sharply highlight the act that he did not fully reject the unilateral arming that Fhaynan had undertaken two years earlier.
He also noted the agreements and shortcomings of Kim Jong-un and Donald Trump in Singapore, at the June 12 summit where Kim promised Trump to "work on the disarmament of the Korean Peninsula" when Trump promised him security in North Korea.
North Korea was nearing the formal end of the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States declared that the Phnom Penh nuclear weapon had to be dropped first.
Washington also refrained from discussing lifting sanctions on North Korea.
"The United States demands that Korea "first disarm" and increase pressure in the form of sanctions to achieve this goal, and also rely on the "Declaration of the End of the War"," said Rhim.
"The idea that sanctions can get us down is just a dream for those who have no idea about us.
But the problem is that sanctions will only deepen our distrust.
What he didn't mention about the plans for the second summit between Kim and Trump, which the American leader highlighted at a UN meeting this week.
Instead, the minister highlighted the three meetings he had held over the past five months with South Korean leader Moon Jae-in, adding: "If the weapons problem had been with the United States instead of South Korea, the disarmament of the Korean Peninsula would not have been so difficult".
However, the tone of his speech was markedly different from that of his speech at the United Nations last year. The General Assembly, which aimed to negotiate between the United States and North Korea, became irreplaceable after "Mr. Bad President" Trump called Kim "Rocket Man" on a suicide mission.
At a joint meeting last year, Trump, who last year promised complete destruction to Kim and North Korea, summoned the North Korean leader, but said there was more to be done and sanctions would continue until Korea began the disarmament process.
On Wednesday, Trump said he didn't have time for it, "If it takes two years, three months, five months, it doesn't matter".
China and Russia say the UN Security Council should reward the brave move.
Meanwhile, the United States Secretary-General told the UN Security Council on Thursday that "the Security Council must continue to implement the joint orders without any delay in order to finally confirm the armistice".
The Security Council unanimously imposed sanctions on North Korea in 2006 to limit and reduce funding for Phnom Penh in the development of nuclear and firearms.
Pompeo met at a UN meeting and announced that he would be coming to Phnom Penh next month for a second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last meeting did not go so well.
He left the bench in July, saying that only North Korea had made progress in formulating its "extreme demands".
North Korea promised to review the disarmament process this month and "take the necessary measures".
Rim said Kim told him that the "reasonable measures" he was pursuing were security guarantees Trump promised him in Singapore and where he promised him normalization of relations with Washington.
Harvard students took a course on getting enough rest
Harvard University has offered a special course to all students that focuses on teaching students to get enough rest, while the trend toward night sweats and caffeine addiction among younger generations is growing daily.
Academics have found that students who go to number one universities don't even know how to behave.
Charles Zissler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, designed this course, which he believes is the first of its kind in the United States.
She decided to start a course like this after learning how sleep disorders affect learning.
"After one meeting, a girl came up to me and said, 'Why are they telling me this now, in my senior year?'
He said that no one had ever told him about the importance of sleep, which surprised me,' he told the Telegraph.
This course, I took in my first year, is designed to explain to students how much good sleep affects academic and athletic attendance, and overall health.
Paul Barrera, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and the university's chief health officer, said the university decided to offer a similar course after seeing how many children had been sleeping poorly during the week.
The one-hour course includes a set of interactive assignments.
One of the images in this section shows different items, such as coffee cups, blankets, exercise shoes, and books, and shows the effect of caffeine and sunlight on how they affect your athletic performance and what it means to have a sleeping routine.
In another section, visitors are asked how much of a risk of stroke, cancer, and depression is associated with sleep disorders.
A map on campus, with its markings, gives students an incentive to reflect on their daily routines.
'We know that all of this will not change the behavior of students at once.
But we believe that they have the right to know - just as they know the consequences of smoking", said Professor Siessler.
The 'night-time' culture still exists, he said, adding that modern technology and the increased pressure on students are further contributing to the problem of sleep disorders.
Well, quality sleep should be the 'secret weapon' for students to fight stress, fatigue, and irritability - and to avoid being overweight, because lack of sleep makes our bodies fearful and makes them constantly hungry.
Raymond Sowe, a 19-year-old Californian who studies chemistry and physical biology, helped Professor Seussler write the course after Sowe took him through one class with a professor last year as a freshman.
He said the course opened his eyes and motivated him to take a broad-minded course.
The next step he hopes is to ask all graduates to take a similar course before they get back into the learning environment.
Professor Sisler advises students to set an alarm both before bed and after waking up, and he also suggests that students should avoid the blue light that electric screens and LEDs emit, and can alter their heart rate sensitively, causing subsequent sleep disturbances.
Livingston 1-0 Rangers: The Mango goal defeated the Gerard boys
The Rangers suffered another defeat on the road after Dolly Menga's goal defeated Steven Gerrard's team 1-0.
The Ibroncs were hoping to record their first win since a 4-1 win over St Johnstone last February, but Gary Holt's side beat Gerard and gave him a second loss in 18 games as manager, leaving his side eight points behind Ledbrook in the Premier League lead.
The menga struck seven minutes before the end of the first half and broke the ranger line, which had never been at that level of supply.
When Rangers dropped to sixth, Livingston came in third, only one goal behind Hibernate.
And besides, the Rangers may have an additional problem after their starting quarterback Calum Spencer hit his head with an off-field shot.
Gerard made eight changes during the game to the very part of the team that beat Ayr in the quarter-finals of the Betfred Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, has finished 11th in the same points he scored last week, and he's grateful for the reaction his players' form has generated in every game.
The Rangers may have had more balls, but Livingston did more with the ball than they did.
The Ranger was usually to be sent off two minutes before Menga could catch the ball for Scott Pittman on the first pitch, but the Ranger's attack was cancelled by the opposing midfielder.
The kick from Keegan Jacobs made it to Skipper's Craig, but defensive back Alan Litgow was able to get the ball back.
The Rangers were able to get the ball back, but eventually they had more faith than hope.
Alfredo Morello believed he was being given a chance at a penalty kick after he hit Stephen Lowell, but the judge denied the request by raising the flag.
The Rangers managed to make two strikes in the first half, but it was not that difficult for the opposing team's goalkeeper, Liam Cale, to beat the balls thrown by Lasana and Ovie Azaria.
Livingston's opening in the 34th minute could have been crucial, and no one can deny that he deserved it.
The Rangers still couldn't cope with Jacobs' deep defense.
Scott Arfield is not hurt because Deccan Gallagher handed the ball to Robinson, who gave the ball to him and handed the Menga to finish the attack.
Gerard replaced Ryan Kent on the break, and the change had some effect on the flank, but the block from the defensive player erased everything.
But Livingston was still able to maintain the pace he wanted, and thus destroy the opponent, using the long lines of Litgow and Hacklet.
Holt's team could have taken the lead last time around, but McGregor was firm on the field and didn't give up every maneuver Jacobs made until Litgoum made a corner from a distance.
With the Rangers' change, Glen Middleton also demanded a penalty shoot-out at the end of the game, but the referee also refused.
Almanac: The inventor of the integers
And now a page from our Sunday Morning Almanac: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago, and the counting process is going on... the day that the future physicist Johann Wilhelm "Hans" Hagger was born in Germany.
Gagher invented a method of calculating and detecting radioactivity, a discovery that laid the foundation for the Gagher number.
In science, the Agarwal has since become a part of the popular culture, as well as in the 1950 film Colorado Call, which features a dialogue between scientist Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: "What is this world?"
ROGERS: This is a Giger molecule, used to make radioactive minerals like uranium.
When you do these headphones, you can understand the effects of mineral atoms, which are radioactively trapped".
Evans: "You said it would really blow up right now!"
Hans Agger died in 1945, just days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name is still alive.
A new cancer vaccine teaches the immune system to detect cancerous cells
The new cancer vaccine teaches the immune system to find and kill the cancerous cells.
The discovery of cells that have been destroyed by the vaccine is part of the treatment.
The method involves removing immune cells from the patient's body and making laboratory changes to them.
After the change, they can "find" the proteins that are typical of many types of cancer and then re-inject them.
The trial vaccine has shown satisfactory results among cancer patients.
One woman's ovarian cancer was cured for more than 18 months.
The method involves extracting immune cells, changing them in laboratory conditions to "find" the HER2 protein that is characteristic of many types of cancer, and then re-injecting them.
"The results show that the vaccine is promising", says Jay Berzowski, a professor at the U.S. National Cancer Institute in Maryland.
"HER2 causes the growth of cancers such as breast, ovarian, lung, and intestinal", he says.
This approach to immune cells is also used to treat leukemia.
Ken West started his protracted appeals on Saturday Night Live with the caption, "Make America Great Again".
All of this didn't go well.
Kanye West's performance caused outrage on the show. In his performance, he accused US President Donald Trump of running again in 2020.
When he performed the third song, "Ghost Town", he was struck by a sign that read, "Let America Be Great Again". His emotional speech was directed against Democrats and reaffirmed his support for Trump.
"Every time I talk to a white person, they say, 'How can you like Trump when he's racist?'
West said, "If I was worried about racism, I would have left America a long time ago".
Saturday Night Live began with a sketch in which Hollywood star Matt Damon humiliated Brett Kavanaugh's performance before the Senate Judiciary Committee. Kavanaugh's Christian Ford is accused of sexual assault.
Although West's performance was not televised, it was uploaded to social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It's unclear if he was trying to sell the post to Rocky West.
West was also worried that he was having problems with the Hood behind the scenes.
"They got me in the back of the room.
They said, "Don't go on stage like that".
They got me!
And then they said I was drowning", reports the Washington Examiner West.
West continues, "I was wearing Superman's hat, because that means you can't tell me what to do.
"I'm not a man, but I'm a man".
His comments have caused at least two disagreements between the audience and the cast. One person told Variety: "There was a lot of silence in the studio".
West was invited to perform in place of the singer Amanda Grande, whose former lover, rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days earlier.
West has been playing a lot of people with his song "I Love You" in which he wears a Perry's Bottle costume.
West was endorsed by the head of the conservative NGO TPUSA, Kennedy Turner, who tweeted, "One of the most fatherly people: Thank you for standing up against the mob".
Karen Hunter, the host of the talk show, said on Twitter that West was just "be who you are, and that's great".
"But I cannot reward anyone (by buying their music or supporting their creation) who promotes an ideology that is harmful to my society.
He's free.
We are free too", he added.
Before the show started, the rapper tweeted that he had changed his formal name to YE.
He's not the first artist to change his name. Big Diddy, also known as Pop Daddy, Poppy and P Diddy, has followed.
The rapper Snoop Dogg was also known as Snoop Lion, a musical legend, the Prince, who changed his name to "The Artist Who Was Known as Prince".
The murder attempt at a Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after he stabbed a man at a restaurant in East Belfast on Friday.
Police said the incident took place in Balihacamore.
The defendant is due in Belfast Magistrates' Court on Monday.
The DA's office will review the charges.
The King's Speech star Keith Harington speaks about "toxic musculature"
Keith Harington is best known for his role as John Snow in the HBO fantasy series Kingdom Gate Games.
The 31-year-old actor talks about the stereotype of the hero Macho. He says that when boys see such roles on screen, they think that if they are annoying, they will get respect from others.
Speaking to The Sunday Times Culture, Keith notes that "something is wrong" and wonders how to solve the problem of toxic masculinity in the #Me era.
Keith, who recently married 31-year-old "Kingdom Gate" star Rose Leslie, admits that he feels strongly about dealing with this problem.
"I feel strongly about what we have done wrong with masturbation", she says.
"What did we teach boys when they were growing up? That's why we see these problems now".
Keith believes that the existence of masculine heroes on television is partly responsible for this problem.
He continues, "What is natural and what is learned?
What is it that they teach on the street and on TV that forces boys to stand up for what it means to be a man?
I think one of the most important questions of our time is, how can we change this?
Because obviously, something is not right for young men".
In an interview, he admitted that he would not be touching the prequel and sequel to "Kingdom Gate Games" when the series finale comes out next summer.
From November, Keith will star in Sam Shepard's upcoming film The True West, a story about a film producer and his deaf brother.
The actor recently said that the best thing about being a part of the "Kingdom Gate Games" was meeting his wife, Rose.
"I met my wife on this show, which is, in fact, this show, which is where I started my family, and that's where my life begins", he said.
Rose plays the role of Igrit, who falls in love with Keith's character, John Snow, in the Emmy Award-winning fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 on Leslie's family estate in Scotland.
AIDS: China is talking about a 14 percent increase in new cases
China has announced that the number of people living with HIV has increased by 14 percent.
More than 820,000 people have been infected in the country, according to the Health Ministry.
About 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018.
Most of them were transmitted through sex, which is different from past experiences.
Traditionally, HIV spread rapidly through blood transfusions in different parts of China.
But the number of people infected with this disease has almost gone to zero, say representatives of China's Ministry of Health at a conference in Yunnan province.
Yet, every year the number of people living with AIDS in China increases by 100,000.
HIV transmission through sex is a major problem in China's LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but LGBT discrimination continues there.
Studies show that because of the conservative values of the country, 70 to 90 percent of men who have sex with men will eventually marry a woman.
The transmission of the disease is due to the use of improper means of self-defense during sex.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has pledged to make AIDS treatment accessible to everyone to help alleviate the problem.
Maxine Waters denies that staff members have leaked Republican Senate data, calling it "dangerous lies" and "fraud theories".
U.S. House of Representatives member Maxine Waters denies Wednesday's allegations that a member of her staff shared the personal information of three Republican senators and posted it on Wikipedia pages.
He claimed that the allegations were being handled by far-right experts and sites.
"Lies, lies, and more disgusting lies", Waters said in a statement posted on Twitter.
The personal information released included the addresses and phone numbers of South Carolina Senators Lindsey Graham and Utah Senators, Mike Lee and Orin Hatch.
The information was leaked online on Thursday by an unknown person during a Senate panel hearing on charges of sexual assault of Useness Court of Appeals candidate Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak came after three senators asked Kavanaugh questions.
Conservative sites like Gateway Pundit and RedState say the post was uploaded from an IP address that connects to the WaterStreet office.
"This is a baseless accusation, it is false and it is absolutely false", Waters continues.
"My staff member is not responsible for any of this leakage. We have made a compromise on their identity, personal information and security.
"This is a baseless accusation, it is a false one and it is an absolute lie".
Waters's claim was quickly followed by critical reviews, including from former White House press secretary Arie Fletcher.
"He denies it in anger", writes Fletcher.
"This fact tells us that Waters does not have the temperament to be a member of Congress.
When someone is accused of something they didn't do, they don't get angry.
A person does not become a Jew.
People don't ask questions about the motives of the accusers.
Rather, it keeps you calm and calm".
Fletcher apparently compared Waters' reaction to criticism from Democrats of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused by critics of looking very angry at Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, the Republican candidate who votes for Waters to run for office in the midterm elections, also tweeted his views.
"Oh, if that's true", he tweeted.
In a statement, Waters said his cabinet had warned "the relevant services and law enforcement agencies about this fraud.
We're making sure that the perpetrators are found, he continued, and that they are legally held accountable for all their actions, which are destructive and dangerous to any and all of my employees.
John English's review of the new hit - a weak parody of the spy by Rowan Atkinson
It's now a tradition to look for Brexit meaning in any new British-themed film, and it seems to be a reference to this new version of the Johnny English action-comedy parody franchise - which began back in 2003 with Johnny English and was revived in 2011 with the film adaptation of Johnny English.
Is ironic self-sacrifice supposed to become our nation's new export opportunity on the subject of what clear rubbish we are?
Anyway, the Englishman's license for the blind, rubber-faced, incompetent Johnny was renewed for a second time to make things weird -- which is more than anything else a sign that he's a broad comic book creature designed for non-English-speaking movie-loving areas.
Of course, he's a stupid secret agent who, despite his bizarre pretensions, has a slightly cluttered glamour, Mr. Bean's stripes, and the unbridled qualities of a gel that contributes one note to the motivation for the fire wheel at the opening ceremony of the 2012 London Olympics.
It's also based on the traveler and international mystery man Atkinson once played in a forgotten Barclaycard TV commercial that was sowing chaos on his way.
There's a good moment or two in this last part of John English.
I liked it when John in England, dressed in medieval clothes, approached the helicopter and the rotor face gently reclined on its back.
Atkinson's physical comedy talent is on the surface, but humor seems a little weakened and oddly blurred, especially when serious movie brands like 007 and Mission: Impossible themselves confidently offer comedy as an ingredient.
It feels like humor is meant for kids, not adults, and for me, the silly accidents of Johnny English are not as creative and focused as the Atkinson Motion Picture jokes of Mr. Bean.
The constant message today is that the UK is in serious trouble.
A cyber hacker has accessed the top secret British spy website, revealing the identities of all British field agents, to the dismay of other agents -- unfortunately, a minor role for Kevin Eldon.
This is the final cut for the prime minister, a pompous and militant figure who is already suffering a full-blown political dislike: Emma Thompson is doing the best she can for this Quasi-Theresa-Me character, but there's not much to work with in the script.
His intelligence advisers tell him that since every spy is compromised, he needs to get someone back from retirement.
It means fooling John English himself, who is now a teacher at some prestigious institution, but informally teaches you how to become a secret agent: Here are some good jokes when a school in England offers a spy rock academy.
In England, he was sent back to Whitehall for an emergency briefing and reunited with his longtime companion, Buffy, who is still played by Ben Miller.
Buffy is now a married man, married to a submarine captain, a fun hockey blue roll where Vicky Pepperdine is a little lost.
So, as Batman and Robin, Her Majesty's Secret Service, are again involved in the terrible miscarriage of justice, they suddenly meet Olga Kurilenko's beautiful fortune-teller, Ophelia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the prime minister is being dangerously haunted by the magic of a charismatic tech billionaire who claims to be able to solve Britain's computer test: the villain Jason Volta, played by Jake Les.
English and Buffy begin their odyssey with Persian high-pitched groans: carrying a whisper, they set fire to a expensive French restaurant; they create chaos and steal from the Waltz on a luxurious yacht; and in England, he induces a holy anarchy when he tries to use a virtual reality device to get a good grasp of the interior of the Waltz house.
All the stops, of course, are made in this last order, but as kind and energetic as it is, there's not enough children's TVs for that.
It's pretty average.
And like in any other British film, I couldn't help but wonder, can the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that's really fair to his talent?
The Labour Party has refused to develop a plan for Britons to work four days a week and get five days' pay.
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party is considering a radical plan that British people will work four days a week - but get paid five.
The party is reportedly expected to be paid by the company's executives for the savings from the AI revolution, giving them an extra day off.
This will allow employees to enjoy the three-day weekend, but they will still be paid the same amount at home.
Sources say the idea was based on the party's economic agenda and plans to rejuvenate the country for the benefit of its employees.
The shift to a four-day week has already been approved by unions as a way for employees to benefit from a changing economy.
A senior Labour Party source told The Sunday Times: "A policy review is expected to be announced by the end of this year".
'This will not happen suddenly, but the four-day workweek is an ambition that is consistent with the Party's approach to balancing the economy to the benefit of employees, as well as the overall industrial strategy of the Party.'
The Labour Party is not the first to come up with this idea, the Green Party promised a four-day work week in the 2017 general election campaign.
The Labour Party's aspirations are not fully appreciated at the moment, however.
A Labour Party spokesman said: 'The four-day work week is not Party policy and is not considered by the Party.'
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell used last week's Labour Party conference to clarify his view of the economy on socialist economics.
Mr. McDonnell said he was willing to delegate power to "unnamed directors" and "speculators" in utilities.
The shadow chancellor's plans also suggest that current shareholders in water companies may not fully recover their interests because the Labour government could prosecute them for a perceived crime.
He also confirmed a plan to put employees on the board and create an inclusive ownership fund to give 10 percent of the private sector companies' capital to employees, which is equivalent to an annual dividend of £500.
Lyndsey Graham, John F. Kennedy, say whether the 60 Minutes will replace the FBI's investigation into Kavanaugh.
The Federal Bureau of Investigation has delayed the final vote process for Judge Brett Kavanaugh's appointment to the Supreme Court for at least a week and raises the question of whether the bureau's findings will force Republican senators to back them.
In an interview with the weekly 60 Minutes, Scott Pell asked Republican senators John F. Kennedy and Lindsay Graham if the Federal Bureau could boast anything that would change their minds.
Kennedy was more open than his colleague in South Carolina.
"I mean, of course", Kennedy said.
"I said I was going to the hearing, I said I was talking to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after it happened, when the charges were filed, and I said, 'Are you that Ken?'
He was tough, tough, and distinct".
However, the sound of the grime seems to be a bit of a curve.
"My mind is completely filled with Brett Kavanot, and that would be a dynamite charge", he said.
"Dr. Ford, I know what happened, but I know this: Brett firmly denied it", Graham added, referring to Christine Blessey Ford.
"And no one who calls him can confirm it.
This is 36 years old.
I don't see any change".
What is the World Citizen Festival, and has it done anything to alleviate poverty?
This Saturday, New York City is hosting the World Citizen Festival, an annual music event that has an extremely impressive cast of performing stars and an equally impressive mission to end global poverty.
Now in its seventh year, the World Citizen Festival will see tens of thousands of people rallying on the grandstand of Central Park, not only to enjoy the performances of Janet Jackson, Cardy Bee and Sean Mendes, but to raise awareness of the event's true purpose, which is to end extreme poverty by 2030.
The World Citizen Festival, which began in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international advocacy group that hopes to end poverty, increase the number of people who fight it.
To receive a free event ticket (unless you want to buy a VIP ticket), concertgoers must complete a number of tasks, or "activities", such as volunteering, writing to a world leader, making a phone call, or any other important way to raise awareness about the event's true purpose, which is to end poverty.
But just how successful is the World Citizens' Festival, 12 years before it's done?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert the real way to convince people to take action, or is there just another instance of so-called "clictivism" - when people think they're making a real difference by signing an online petition or posting a tweet?
Since 2011, Global Citizen reports that it has counted 19 million more "activities" from its supporters, pushing the hosts for different goals.
He says these activities have helped motivate world leaders to announce commitments and policies worth more than $37 billion, which are expected to impact the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the Group cited 390 liabilities and declarations based on its activities, of which at least $10 billion has already been distributed or raised.
The group estimates that the money provided has directly affected more than 649 million people worldwide.
Some of these commitments include the Food Power, a UK-based partnership of investors and performers that has committed to "helping children reach their full potential", which they pledge to donate Rwandan $35 million to help end the country's food shortage after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from global citizens.
"With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and global citizens like you, we can make history with the social injustice of food shortages", Food Force Ambassador Tracy Ullman told a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 activities were held, calling on the UK to improve food for mothers and babies, the government announced it would fund a project to provide food power to 5 million women and children.
And on their website, they answer one of the most frequently asked questions, "Why do you think we can end extreme poverty?"
The World Citizen replied, "It's going to be a long and difficult road - sometimes we'll give up and lose.
But just like the great civil rights and anti-apartheid movements before us, we will succeed because together we are stronger.
Janet Jackson, The Weeknd, Sean Mendez, Cardi B, Janelle Moane are among some acts performed at this year's event in New York City, hosted by Deborah-Lee Ferness Hugh Jackman.
The U.S. could use the Navy to blockade Russian energy exports.
"If necessary", Washington could use its Navy to interfere with Russian energy, hitting markets, including in the Middle East, U.S. Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zink, quoted by the Washington Examiner as saying.
Zincke argued that Russia's involvement in Syria - specifically where it operates at the invitation of a legitimate government - is the basis for exploring new energy markets.
"I believe that the reason they're in the Middle East is because they want to buy energy, just like they do in Eastern Europe, in the southern heart of Europe", he said.
And, according to official data, there are ways and means to deal with it.
"The United States has the ability, with our Navy, to ensure that shipping is open and, if necessary, to blockade to ensure that their energy is not floating in the market", he said.
Zinc addressed the event, which was hosted by Consumers Energy Association, a nonprofit group that describes itself as "the voice of energy consumers" in the United States.
He went to compare Washington's approach to Russia and Iran, and he said they were basically the same.
"The economic option for Russia and Iran is less, more fuel to use and replace as fuel barges", he said, citing what Russia "has as a specialism" that its economy depends on fossil fuels.
Reports are coming in that the Trump administration is aiming to increase its liquefied gas exports to Europe and replace Russia, a much cheaper option for European consumers.
To that end, Trump administration officials, including US President Donald Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to reject the "unsuccessful" North Stream 2 pipeline project, which Trump says is a "treachery" to Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the 11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which is designed to double the existing pipeline volume to 110 billion cubic meters, is a clean economic project.
Kremlin believes that Washington's blunt opposition to the project is simply driven by economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I believe we share the view that energy cannot be a means to exert pressure and that consumers should be able to choose suppliers", Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said after meeting with US Energy Minister Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The US position was displeased by Germany, which confirmed its participation in the project.
Germany's leading industry organization, the German Industrial Federation (BDI), has called on the United States to abandon the EU's energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when a third state interferes with our energy supply", said the chairman of the German Federation of Industries (BDI), Dietrich Kempf, after the last meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will "look seriously" at running for president in 2020, says a Massachusetts senator
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday she would "take a serious look" at running for president after the midterm elections.
In the town hall of Holloway, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that he was considering a participation.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and build our broken government, and that involves having a woman in your head", she said, according to Hill.
"After November 6, I will seriously consider running for president".
Warren summoned President Donald Trump to the mayoral office, saying that he was "leading this country in the wrong direction.
"I'm so concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy", he said.
Warren was sincere in his criticism of Trump and his Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh.
On Friday, Warren tweeted, "Of course, we need to get the FBI to investigate before we can vote".
However, a poll published on Thursday showed that most Warren voters don't think he should cast a ballot in 2020.
According to a poll by the Center for Policy Research at Suffolk University/Boston Globe, "probably" 48 percent of Massachusetts voters said the senator should not cast a ballot.
Twenty-two percent support running for office.
The poll showed more support for former Governor Deval Patrick, with 38 percent supporting the potential candidate and 48 percent against him.
Other, more well-known names among Democrats are considering a likely 2020 election involving Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden has said he will officially make a decision in January, reports the Associated Press.
Sarah Palin quotes the post-traumatic stress disorder of Track Palin at the Donald Trump rally.
Track Pailin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after being called in in September.
He was arrested and charged with domestic violence on Monday night.
"What my own son is going through, and what it's going to affect him when he comes back, I'm going to link it to other families who are suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder and some of the injuries that our soldiers were getting back", she told the audience at a Donald Trump rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Paine called his arrest "a blind eye to a clear problem", and said of his son and other war veterans, "They're going back a little bit, they're going back a little bit, they're going back a little bit, they're going back a little bit, and they're wondering if they're getting the respect that their friends soldiers and pilots and other members of the military have given for their country".
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence against a woman, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department, who said the message included domestic violence and being unconscious while carrying a gun.
18 States and the District of Columbia support the new asylum law
Thirteen states and the District of Columbia support a legal challenge to a new U.S. policy that does not provide shelter for victims of gang or domestic violence.
On Friday, representatives from 18 states and the District of Columbia filed a court-appointed summary in Washington, D.C., to support asylum seekers in their policies, NBC News reports.
The full name of the defendant in the case against Grace Sessions, which the American Civil Liberties Union filed in August against federal policy, has not been released.
He said that his partner "and his violent gang member's children" had abused him, but U.S. officials denied him asylum on July 20.
He was arrested in Texas.
State officials who support Grace have described El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala as making large numbers of asylum seekers in the United States because these nations face acute problems of gangs and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy overturned a 2014 decision by the Immigration Appeals Board that allowed undocumented immigrants to flee domestic violence and seek asylum.
In a statement Friday, the Chief of Staff of the District of Columbia, General Carl Rassin, said the new policy "ignores decades of state, federal, and international law".
"Federal law requires that all asylum claims be based on specific facts and circumstances of the claim, and this restriction violates that principle", the court-appointed judge said.
The clergy then argued in a resume that the immigration policy that forbids entry is contrary to U.S. policy, saying they are becoming more entrepreneurial and "providing us with the necessary workforce".
Reverend General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges in June to stop providing shelter to victims of domestic and gang violence.
"Asylum is available to those who leave their country because of persecution or fear of leaving because of race, religion, nationality, or membership in a particular social group or political opinion", Sessions said during a policy announcement on June 11.
There's never been a refuge to alleviate all the problems -- even all the serious problems -- that people face every day around the world.
The sacrifice of the rescuers in Palo Alto, where the death toll in the race for survivors is doubling
For the survivors, the situation was getting worse.
"It feels very tense", said 35-year-old mother, Risa Kusuma, before giving her cold-heated baby a hug in the evacuation center of the devastated city of Palo.
"Every minute, bodies are being brought to the ambulance.
Clean water is not enough".
People are going back to their ruined homes, they're going to dig up the watered-down properties, they're going to try to recover everything they find.
Hundreds of people were injured, and hospitals that were hit by the 7.5 magnitude earthquake were overcrowded.
Some of the injured, including D. Harris, who has broken legs and shoulders, were resting outside the Palos Military Hospital, where patients were being treated outside due to sustained severe aftershocks.
His eyes were filled with tears as he began to re-align his senses when a giant earthquake struck the fifth floor of the hotel where he lived with his wife and daughter.
"It was not time to sacrifice yourself.
I took it to the ruins of the Wall, I think", Harris told The Associated Press, adding that his family was in town for the wedding.
"I heard my wife ask for a shower, then a silence.
I don't know what happened to him and my son.
I hope they are safe".
US ambassador accuses China of "propaganda" and "violence"
A week after the official Chinese newspaper published a four-page ad in which the US daily called for a common trade dispute with China, the US ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the American press to spread propaganda.
US President Donald Trump last Wednesday appealed to the Des Moines Register, Iowa's best-selling newspaper, for the price tag of China's daily daily, after China's allegations of interference in the US congressional elections on November 6 were denied.
Trump's allegations that Beijing is trying to meddle in the US election, which made clear what US officials told Reuters, became a new phase in Washington's escalation of its campaign to pressure China.
While it's normal for foreign governments to place ads to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently caught up in an escalating trade war, where they're raising tariffs on each other's imported goods.
China's counter-tariffs were designed at the beginning of the trade war to hit states for exporters in states like Iowa, which supports Trump's Republican Party, Chinese and American experts say.
Terry Branstead, U.S. ambassador to China and longtime governor of Iowa, China's top exporter of agricultural products, says Beijing has hurt American workers, farmers, and businessmen.
Bransted wrote in the Des Moines Register's Monday issue that China "is now doubling the violence by spreading propaganda in our free press".
"In spreading propaganda, the Chinese government is taking advantage of America's oral tradition of free speech and free press, by placing pricey advertisements in the Des Moines Register", writes Branstead.
"In contrast, here in the Beijing street-side newspaper stall, you'll see a limited difference of opinion and you won't see a real difference of opinion that the Chinese people may have about the trajectory of China's troubled economy, which shows us that the media is under heavy pressure from the Chinese Communist Party", he writes.
He added that "one of China's most famous newspapers refused to publish" his article, but did not say which.
Cavanos' defeat is alienating Republicans from female voters ahead of the midterm elections, analysts warn.
While high-ranking Republicans are in the waiting regime, defending Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, on multiple counts of sexual assault, analysts have warned that they will receive a negative response in the midterm elections, especially from women.
The excitement surrounding this was extremely high, and most Republicans already registered to vote and feel they need to move forward.
There's no way to back up that view", Grant Richer, a professor of political science at the Maxwell School at Syracuse University, told Hill in an article published on Saturday.
Richer said he doubted that Senator Jeff Flake's last-minute push to investigate the Federal Bureau would be enough to calm angry voters.
"Women will not forget yesterday - they will not forget tomorrow or November", said Karen Jean-Pierre, senior advisor to the progressive group MoveOn and national speaker, Friday, according to The Washington Post.
On Friday morning, during a demonstration in the Senate chamber, protesters chanted "November is Coming!" when Republicans who control the Judiciary Committee decided to push ahead with Kavanaugh's appointment, despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blaise Ford, reports Mic.
"The enthusiasm and motivation of the Democrats will be very high", said Steve Rosenberg, a nonpartisan political analyst, to the news site.
"People say it's already high; it's true.
But it can be higher, especially among women voters in the suburbs and young voters, 18 to 29 years old, who, despite disliking the president, often don't run".
Even before Ford's public appearance that reflects his allegations of sexual assault against a Supreme Court nominee, analysts have speculated that it would have a negative outcome if Republicans were to move forward with evidence.
"It's become a silly mess for Republicans", said Michael Still, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, earlier last week, NBC News reported.
"It's not just about the committee vote, or the final vote, or whether Kavanaugh gets elected, it's about how Republicans approach it and how they handle it", said Jesse, director of U.S. Priorities, a group that promotes Democratic choice, in a news release.
However, Americans seem to be somewhat confused about who to trust in the testimony of Ford and Kavanaugh, and a little more supportive of the latter.
A new YouGov survey shows that 41 percent of respondents either absolutely or probably believe in Ford's shows, while 35 percent say they absolutely or probably believe in Kavano.
Additionally, 38 percent say Kavanaugh is likely or unlikely to change his testimony, when only 30 percent say the same on Ford.
Following pressure from Flake, the Federal Bureau is currently investigating charges brought by Ford, as well as at least one other plaintiff, Deborah Ramirez, the Guardian reports.
Ford testified last week under oath to the Senate Judiciary Committee that Kavanaugh had been drinking on him when he was 17.
Ramirez claims that a Supreme Court nominee showed him his sex organs when they were at a party while he was a student at Yale University in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web plans to create a new Internet to take over Google and Facebook.
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, is launching a new project that will challenge Facebook, Amazon, and Google.
The latest project of a technology legend, Inrupt, is the company that is building the Berners-Lee Open Platform Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where to store their data and what rights people have to access any information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that Inrupt's intent is "world dominance".
"We have to do this now", he said at the launch.
"This is a historic moment".
The app uses Solid technology to allow people to create their own personal online data warehouse, or POD.
It may include contact lists, a to-do list, a calendar, a music library, and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack, and Spotify being available in one browser at a time.
What's unique about an online personal data store is that it's entirely up to the user who has access to what kind of information.
The company calls it "data-first authorization".
As CEO John Bruce explains, the idea behind Inrupt is to pool resources, processes, and relevant skills to help make Solid accessible to everyone.
The company currently consists of Burners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform bought by IBM, a few developers signed to work on the project, and a volunteer coding pool.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world will be able to create their own decentralized apps using tools on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team will not talk to "Facebook and Google about whether they're going to bring about a complete change where all their business models are completely self-contained in one day.
"We do not ask for their permission".
In an article published on Saturday on Medium, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt's "mission is to provide commercial energy and ecosystems to protect the integrity and quality of the newly created network on Solid".
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he formed the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been a powerful voice in the net neutrality debate.
Even with Inrupt launching, Berners-Lee will be the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation, and the Open Data Institute.
"I'm very optimistic about this next era of networking", Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Van: The celebration of the victorious victory of the Victorian Cross by a clergyman in World War I
The only clergyman in the Church of England to receive the Victoria Cross as a warrior in World War I was commemorated in his hometown 100 years later.
Lieutenant-Colonel Bernard Van won the award on September 29, 1918, during the attack on Benghazi and Leccar.
However, he was killed by a sniper four days later and never realized he had received Britain's highest military honor.
On Sunday, at a parade, her two grandchildren erected a memorial in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Van, said it was "amazingly symbolic" that the stone was erected on the 100th anniversary of his grandfather's award.
On September 29, 1918, Lieutenant-Colonel Van led his battalion along the St. Cantine Canal, "despite the heavy fire of very heavy knives and artillery and shells", according to the London Times.
Then he went to the line of fire and "very valiantly" led the line forward toward the artillery and fired three of them.
Lieutenant Colonel Van was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, exactly one month before the war ended.
Michael Van, 72, said that his grandfather's actions were "what I couldn't do, but what humility".
He and his brother, Dr. James Van, were also crowned after the parade, led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Van said that he "feels very appreciated for being in the parade", adding that "the courage of a true hero is shown by the support that many people give".
Mixed martial arts fans spent the night watching Bellator 206 instead of the Goose Peppa.
Imagine you hired a whole thirteen to rent a Bellator 206 and couldn't catch the main event.
The San Jose account included 13 battles, including six on the main card, and was shown live in the United Kingdom on Channel 5.
At 6 a.m., as Gerard Moses and Rory McDonald were preparing to meet, viewers in the United Kingdom were stunned when the broadcast switched to Goose Peppa.
Some are heartbroken after being set up all night specifically for that night.
One fan of the children's cartoon tweeted that it was "some sick joke".
"It's a state regulation that at 6 a.m. this show was inappropriate, so they had to switch to a children's program", said David Schwartz, Bellator's senior vice president of marketing and communications, when asked about the show.
"Peppa, yes".
Bellator president Scott Cocker said they were working on their schedule to cater to UK viewers in the future.
"I think when I think about repetition, I think we might think about something", said Cocker.
"But it's six o'clock in the morning on Sunday, and we can't work on it until our time is Sunday, and their time is Monday.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when it was changed, there were a lot of texts going back and forth, and none of them were friendly.
We were trying to fix this, we thought it was a technical flaw.
But it wasn't. It was government business.
I promise you, it won't happen again.
We're going to have five fights instead of six, as we usually do -- we tried to make ourselves look more like fans, and we just got too much.
It's a sad situation".
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley was feeling depressed because of his sexual orientation.
Olympic trainer Tom Daley says he grew up feeling more comfortable than others because of his sexual orientation - but that motivated him to succeed.
The 24-year-old says that he didn't realize it until he went to high school, where "not everyone is like me".
First, speaking on Radio 4's Desert Island Discs, which Lauren Laverne brings, she said she spoke about gay rights to give others "hope".
She also said that after becoming a parent, she's less interested in winning the Olympics.
The long-running show's regular host, Kirsty Young, was ill for several months.
In the first Laverne show, Daley revealed that as a child, she felt "less" than others because "she was socially unacceptable when boys and girls liked her".
She said, "To this day, the feeling that I felt less and different than others was real, and that gave me the strength to succeed".
She wanted to prove that she was "something", she said, so she wouldn't let anyone down when they finally found out about her sexual orientation.
The two-time Olympic bronze medalist became a prominent LGBT campaigner and used her looks at this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to protest the discrimination against homosexuality in the presence of more countries.
He said he took the vote because he was lucky, lived an open life without modification, and wanted to give hope to others.
The three-time world champion said that she fell in love with a man - US filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, who met her in 2013 - "I suddenly fell in love".
Dale married Oscarosan, who is 20 years older than her, last year, but she said age difference was never a problem.
"When you're that old", she said - she competed in her first Olympics at age 14 and her father died of cancer three years later - she said that it was hard to find someone her age who had experienced such a rise and fall.
The couple became parents of a son in June, who was named Robert Ray Black-Daily, and Dailey says his "total values" have changed.
"If you ask me last year, all I wanted was to win a gold medal", he said.
"You know, there are more important things than an Olympic gold medal.
My gold medal is Robbie".
His son is named after his father, Robert, who died in 2011 at age 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his father didn't accept the fact that he had to die, and one of the last things he asked was if they had tickets to London 2012 - because he wanted to be in the front row.
"I couldn't tell him, 'You can't be first, Dad,'" he said.
"I held his hand when he stopped breathing and it didn't happen, until he really stopped breathing and died, I finally couldn't realize that he wasn't immortal", she said.
The following year, Daley competed in the 2012 Olympics and won bronze.
"I knew that this was what I had dreamed of all my life - to be in front of my fans at the Olympics, there was no better feeling than that", she said.
It also inspired her to choose her first song, Proud by Heather Small, which resonated with her at the Olympics and still resonates with Jürgen Spruantell.

The retired Michelsson was in the Ryder Cup application on Saturday.
American Phil Mickelson will set a record this week when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup game, but he has to get back in shape so it doesn't become an accidental stage for him.
Michelsson, who will be competing in the two-year event for the 12th time in a row, was asked by Captain Jim Furyk on Saturday's Foursquare and Forsam.
Instead of being at the center of the action, as it often was in the United States, the five-time major winner divides his day between being a cheerleader and working on his game in the hope that what is hurting him will be fixed.
Never, the most correct driver, even at the peak of his career, is a 48-year-old who is not perfectly suited to a National Golf Course for a long and heavy penalty of a continuous wrong-handed shot.
And if the course itself isn't tough enough, Michelsson, in Week Nine, will be facing the exact British Open champion Francisco Molinari, who is competing with rookie Tommy Fleetwood to win four games this week.
If the Americans start 12 singles games four points down, with a hot start, the Michelsons game will be absolutely important.
Furyk expressed confidence in his man, not that he could say too much.
"He was completely taken by the role he played today, he put his hand on the ring, he touched my arm, and he told me he'd be ready tomorrow", Furyk said.
"He's very confident.
He's in the Hall of Fame, and he's added a lot to these teams in the past and this week.
I probably didn't realize he was playing two games.
I'm more straightforward, but that's how it worked, and that's the way we thought we should share.
She wants to be there, just like everyone else".
This week, Mickelson will be beating Nick Faldo, the record holder for most Ryder Cup appearances.
This could mark the end of Ryder Cup career that never matched the heights of his individual records.
Michelsson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven half-centuries, although Furyk has said his absence brought some uncomfortable feelings.
"He's funny, he's sarcastic, he's talkative, he likes to joke about people, and he's a good guy to have on your team", she explained.
"I think young players joined him, as well as this week, which was a good sight to see.
It offers much more than just playing".
The European captain, Thomas Byrne, knows that the big gap could soon disappear.
Thomas Byrne, the European captain, knows from experience that being ahead by a great margin in the final day's singles can easily turn into an unpleasant race.
Dean made his debut in 1997 for Valderama, where the side captained by Steve Ballesteros had a five-point lead over the Americans but came close to the finish line with a slight margin of victory of 141⁄2-131⁄2.
"You remind yourself that we had a big difference in debt; we had a big difference in Brooklyn where we lost, and we had a big difference in debt where we won, but only", said Björn, after a 5-3 win in 2018 both Friday and yesterday when they had a 10-6 lead over Le Golf National.
So the story tells me and everyone on the team that it's not over.
You're playing full time tomorrow.
Go and do whatever you have to do.
It's not done until you get your points on the board.
We have a goal, and that's to try and win the Cup, and that's what we're focused on.
I've been saying all this time, I'm focused on the 12 players on our side, but we know exactly what's on the other side -- the greatest players in the world".
Satisfied with the way his players played a stressful golf game, Byrne added: "I never imagined it.
Tomorrow we have another beast waiting for us.
We're having individual performances tomorrow, and that's a different thing.
It's a great feeling to be there with your partner, when everything's going well, but when you're out alone, you're going to be checked out as a full golfer.
This is the message you have to get to the players, show your best tomorrow.
Now, you have your partner behind you, and he has to come out and do his best".
Unlike Björn, on the other hand, Jim Furyk expects his players to perform better individually than in pairs, with the exception of Jordan Spit and Justin Thomas, who scored three out of four.
Furyk himself was at both ends of that big run the day before, being part of what was a winning team in Brooklyn until he was defeated when Europe had the "Wonder of the River".
"I remember every damn word out there", he said in response to a question about how captain Ben Crenshaw addressed his players on his final day of the 1999 season.
"We have 12 big games tomorrow, but you want to get off to a fast start like you did in Brooklyn, like you did in the arena.
When this momentum is in one direction, it puts a lot of pressure on those mid-matches.
We've put our lineup together and put our guys out as modestly as we felt, you know, we're trying to do some magic tomorrow".
Thomas took the task to the challenge and sees Rory MacIlroy in the main match, with Paul Case, Justin Rose, John Ram, Tom Fleetwood and Ian Puller and other Europeans in the top half of the lineup.
"I went out with this group of guys in this order because I think it covers all the roads I've been through", Björn said when choosing his single.
The German warship's new delivery was once again postponed.
A new frigate for the German Navy was supposed to be delivered in 2014 to replace the outdated Cold War war warships, but it will not be delivered until at least the future due to faulty systems and rising costs, local media reported.
The takeover of the Rheinland-Pfalz, the flagship of the new Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigates, has been postponed until the first half of 2019, as Die Zeit quotes a military spokesman.
The ship was scheduled to join the fleet in 2014, but problems following a troubled supply delayed the completion of this ambitious project.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg-class ships ordered by the fleet in 2007 are to replace the outdated Bremen-class frigates.
Of course, they'll have a powerful submarine, a range of anti-ship and anti-ship missiles, as well as certain stels technologies, such as radar reduction, infrared and acoustic technologies.
Other important features are long storage periods - it should be possible to deploy new frigates away from home port for two years.
However, the constant delays mean that the latest warships - which are designed to strengthen the German Navy - will be outdated by the time they enter service, Die Zeit reports.
The Abedid F125 frigate made headlines last year when the German Navy officially refused to accept the ship and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
It was the first time the German Navy had returned a shipbuilder after it had been delivered.
The reason for the withdrawal is not well known, but German media noted a number of significant "programming and hardware defects" that rendered the warship useless if it were to be launched on a combat mission.
The software defect was particularly significant, as the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class ship was operated by a crew of 120 sailors - only half the personal strength of an outdated Bremen-class frigate.
It also turns out that the ship is dramatically overweight, which reduces its performance and limits the ability of the fleet to add improvements in the future.
The 7,000-ton Rheinland-Pfalz will be twice as heavy as the similar class of ships used by Germany in World War II.
With the hardware problem, the price tag of the entire project - involving crew re-training - is another issue.
It's reportedly rising to an astonishing 3.1 billion euros ($3.6 billion) from the initial 2.2 billion euros.
The continuing problems of the latest frigates are of particular importance given the recent warning that the German fleet is declining in strength.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, chairman of the German parliament's Defense Committee, admitted that the fleet was actually "defensive of deployable ships".
The spokesman says the problem will build up over time, as old ships have been phased out but no replacement ships have been found.
He complained that not a single Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigate could join the fleet.
The National Trust keeps an eye on the secret lives of the whites
A new study in the Highlands of Scotland aims to investigate how the night owls use the landscape for dinner.
They hope that the findings will shed light on the unique behavior of flying mammals and help us to lead future conservation efforts.
A National Trust for Scotland science study tracks the common and small owls, as well as the brown owls and the dubbenton owls, in the gardens of West Ross.
Special recordings will be set up at key locations along the property to monitor nighttime activities during the season.
NHS staff and volunteers also conduct moving observations using hand-held detectors.
Experts analyze all the sound recordings to determine the frequency of the whistles and what species does.
Then a habitat map and report is created to create a detailed picture of their behavior across the landscape.
Rob Dewar, a conservation adviser to the National Trust for Scotland, hopes the results will reveal which areas of habitat are most important for the birds and how each species will use them.
This information will allow you to determine the benefits of habitat management work, such as how to create meadows to preserve forested areas for nightlife and other related species.
The population of the nightingale in Scotland and the United Kingdom has declined significantly over the past century.
They are threatened by construction and development work that affects their habitat and habitat.
Wind turbines and wind turbines are also at risk, as are paper pulp and some building materials chemicals, as well as domestic cat attacks.
The sleeping pets are not really blind.
However, their nocturnal hunting habits make their ears more useful than their eyes when it comes to preying on prey.
They use sophisticated eco-location techniques to locate insects and track their flight paths.
The National Trust for Scotland, which is responsible for over 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land across the country, takes the hoarding very seriously.
Matt has ten trained experts who regularly conduct research, conduct inspections, and sometimes perform reconstruction work.
The organisation also set up Scotland's first and only overnight nature reserve, the Trevi Land, in Dumfries and Galloway, which is home to eight of Scotland's ten overnight species.
Land manager David Thompson says the land is the perfect area for them.
"Here in Tripoli, we have a lot of room for the nights", he said.
"We have old buildings, lots of old trees, lots of good habitats.
But there's a lot we don't know about the nights yet, so the work we do here and in other lands will help us learn more about what it takes to grow them".
It highlights the importance of nighttime checks on property before security work is done, as the accidental destruction of a single birthstone could kill up to 400 adults and young people, potentially leading to the complete destruction of the local population.
The night owls are protected and killing, burning, harassing or destroying their buffalo is illegal.
Elizabeth Farrell, an officer in the Scottish Night Watch Trust, is raising public awareness to help them.
He said, "We still have a lot to learn about our nights, and we just don't know how our species live".
Ronaldo is acquitted of rape charges and lawyers are suing German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo has called the rape allegations against him "fake news", stating that people "want a cover" using his name.
His lawyers are going to sue the German news magazine Der Spiegel, which published the charges.
A Portuguese and Juventus attacker is accused of raping an American woman named Catherine Majorga at a Las Vegas hotel in 2009.
He's also charged with $375,000 in compensation for keeping quiet about the incident, Der Spiegel reports Friday.
Speaking to 142 followers of Tavi on Instagram live, hours after the allegations were made, Ronaldo, 33, called the allegations "fake news".
"No, no, no, no, no.
What they said today is fake news", says the five-time Golden Ball winner in front of the camera.
"They want to advertise using my name.
That's normal.
They want to be famous for calling my name, but that's part of their job.
I'm a happy man, and everything is fine", the player added with a smile.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to file a lawsuit against Der Spiegel for the heart of the charges, which they have dubbed "a prohibited report based on suspicion in the area of private life", reports Reuters.
Lawyer Christian Chercy says the player is being compensated "for moral damage, the appropriate amount of the severity of the violation, which may be one of the most serious violations of privacy rights in recent years".
The incident is said to have occurred in June 2009 at the Palm Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After a nightclub meeting, Ronaldo and Majorga reportedly returned to the player's number, where he was charged with assaulting him in a file filed filed in Clark County Court in Nevada.
Majorga says that after the incident, Ronaldo fell to his knees and told him that he was "99 percent" a "good guy" who was "one percent".
According to the evidence, Ronaldo admitted that the couple had sex, but it was by mutual consent.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and showed him pictures of her injuries taken in hospital, but then agreed to settle the case out of court because she felt "fear of revenge" and feared she would become "publicly humiliated".
The 34-year-old says that he is now trying to recover from the case, as he is still injured in the incident.
Ronaldo was on his way to Real Madrid from Manchester United on the attack charge, and this summer he was transferred to the Italian giant in July for a €100 million deal.
Brexit: The UK is calling for the loss of car manufacturers.
The UK is in the process of losing its position as a world leader in automotive manufacturing, business secretary Greg Clark has said since Brexit.
He added that it was significant that Toyota UK told the BBC that if Britain left the EU without a deal, it would cause temporary production delays at its plant in Burnstone, near Derby.
We need a deal", Mr. Clark said.
A Japanese automaker said that the impact of border delays in the event of a default would be on Brexit jobs.
The Burnstone plant (which produces the Toyota Auris and Avensis) produced about 150,000 cars last year, and 90% of them were exported to other EU countries.
"I think if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, we'll see production stopped at our factory", said Marvin Cook, CEO of Toyota, in Burnaston.
Other UK carmakers fear leaving the EU without agreements on cross-border trade, including Honda, BMW, and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW, for example, says it's closing its mini-factory in Oxford a month after Brexit.
The main issue that concerns the opinions of car manufacturers is the risks to the supply chain in the event of a failure to implement the Brexit deal.
Toyota's production line operates on a so-called timeline, where spare parts are delivered every 37 minutes to cars already ordered from suppliers in both the European Union and the United Kingdom.
If the UK leaves the EU without a deal on 29 March, this could lead to border disruptions, which could lead to delays and a shortage of parts in the industry.
Toyota would not be able to stop inventory for more than a day at its Derbyshire plant, the company said, and so production would be halted.
Mr. Clark said that Theresa May's plan for future relations with the EU is designed to prevent such checks at the border.
We want to get the best deal that will allow us, as I said, to succeed at this stage and also to take advantage of this opportunity in the future".
In addition to the evidence from other manufacturers, we definitely need the ability to continue to implement highly successful supply chain events.
Toyota has not commented on the shutdown, but it warned that if it continues for a long time, it will reduce the competitiveness of the plant and ultimately reduce jobs.
Peter Zwalaris, who has worked at the Burnstone facility for 24 years and is the head of the union at the plant, says that his members are very concerned about this fact.
The government spokesman said: "We have presented a precise and rational plan for our future relations with the European Union".
The White House has announced that Trump's meeting with Rosenstein could be postponed further.
According to a White House statement on Sunday, senior officials at the White House said that Donald Trump's meetings with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be postponed to next week, as the battle with Supreme Court nominee Brett Kaufman continues.
Rosenstein is monitoring the work of Special Counsel Robert Mueller, who investigates Russian election meddling, links between Trump's assistance to Russia, and potential legislative oversight by the president.
Whether Trump will confront his deputy attorney general and pose a threat to Mueller's independence will be the subject of Washington's rumours for months.
Earlier this month, in an interview with the New York Times, Rosenstein said he was considering using hearing aids in a conversation with Trump, and the possibility of removing the president under the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denied the report.
Last Monday, he went to the White House, and according to the report, he was planning to retire.
As a result, Trump's meeting at the United Nations in New York was postponed to Wednesday.
Trump said he did not want to disagree with Rosenstein, but he has since postponed a meeting with the Senate Judiciary Committee to avoid a conflict, which at the time was listening to Kavanaugh and one of the ladies, Christine Blaise Ford, testify about her sexual crimes.
On Friday, Trump ordered the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation into Kavanaugh's complaint, and then postponed the vote to the Senate plenary.
On Sunday, Trump's press secretary Sarah Sanders was on Fox News.
Regarding the meeting with Rosenstein, he said: "The exact date has not yet been set, a remark may be made this week, I think the postponement of the meeting is related to the Supreme Court's ongoing issues.
But we'll see and we'll definitely report the news to the media.
Several reporters are going to challenge the evidence that Sanders hasn't been briefed at the White House since September 10.
The host was interested in the reason for this.
Sanders said the lack of briefings was not related to the unacceptability of the TV's performance, but he added: "I agree that this performance is intended to have a special effect".
Later, he said that the direct link between Trump and the media would grow.
The president has more Q&A sessions than his predecessors, added a reviewer, and without citing evidence, added, "We've reviewed their numbers".
Sanders said that there will be briefings in the future, but if the press has a chance to directly question the president of the United States, it's much better than talking to me.
We're trying to do a lot, and as you can see, a lot of work has been done in the last few weeks, and we're also planning to hold briefings where you'll have the opportunity to speak directly to the president of the United States.
Trump regularly listens to questions when he leaves the White House, or attends open sessions and high-level press conferences.
Special press conferences are rarely held.
This week in New York, the president is supposed to demonstrate why ideas are being freely generated and the original image is being shown to a gathering of reporters.
The Minister of Health wrote to an EU employee at NHS Scotland about fears of Brexit
The Minister of Health wrote to EU staff at the NHS in Scotland, expressing their gratitude and desire on behalf of the country to keep their jobs after Brexit.
MSP Jean Freeman wrote a letter at least six months before the UK left the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed to cover the compensation claimed by EU citizens working in public services.
In her letter, Ms Freeman writes: "Throughout the summer, negotiations have been underway between the EU and the UK, with a decision likely to be made in the autumn.
However, the UK government is also preparing for a possible default scenario.
I understand that this can happen at a time that is uncomfortable for you.
So I want to remind you once again how much I appreciate the contributions of each member of staff, regardless of their nationality.
Colleagues from the European Union and other regions share with us valuable experience and knowledge that will strengthen and improve healthcare, and benefit patients and communities in our country.
Scotland is actually your homeland, and we really want you to stay here.
Christian Abercrum is undergoing surgery after suffering a spinal cord injury
Tennessee State Tigers quarterback Chris Abercrum underwent surgery after suffering a season-ending injury in a 31-27 loss to the Vanderbilt Commodores, according to Mike Organ of Tennessee.
Tennessee State head coach Rod Reed told reporters that the player suffered a mid-game injury.
And then he came up to the side of the line, and then this accident happened, and Reed was chasing him.
The trainers and medical staff gave Abercrumb oxygen on site before he was moved to the podium and taken to further investigation.
A Tennessee State official told Chris Harris of WSMV, Tennessee, in Nashville that Abercrum was being prepared for surgery at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harry added that he has no further information about the injury at this time and the state of Tennessee is trying to determine the location of the injury.
Abercrumb, a Redskins athlete, is playing his first season in Tennessee after moving to Illinois.
On Saturday, he scored five touchdowns, and he scored 18 total touchdowns this season.
Foreign buyers are ashamed of higher taxes on property purchases in the United Kingdom
Foreign buyers are embarrassed by higher interest rates when they buy property in the UK with extra cash used for decaying layers under the new Tor plans.
Moving will neutralize the success of carbon in the way of attracting young voters
The increase in excise duties will be due to those who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom
The House estimates it will increase to £120 million a year to help homeless people.
Theresa May's announcement today will require foreign buyers to pay higher property taxes when buying property in the UK with additional cash to help homeless citizens.
The move is seen as an attempt to neutralize Jeremy Corbyn's success in attracting young mortgage-holders to provide more affordable housing and rely on higher-income citizens.
The increase in the tax will be imposed on individuals and companies who do not pay taxes in the UK, with additional funds to help the authorities fight the problem of homeless citizens.
Sub-taxation in addition to the current tax rate, including the high levels introduced two years ago on second homes and rental homes, will be charged at a rate of three percent.
The line predicts an increase to £120 million a year.
Thirteen percent of newly built London properties are bought by non-residents, raising prices and slowing the entry of first-time home buyers into the sector.
Many of the rich districts of the country, especially the capital, have been transformed into so-called ghost towns, since most of them have been bought by foreigners who are not in the country.
A new policy is being developed at this stage after Boris Johnson called for a reduction in the federal income tax to allow young people to buy their first home.
He accuses major development companies of keeping prices high, and of not using them, and he calls on Mrs. May to cancel quotas on affordable housing.
Mr. Corbin made a statement on the major reforms proposed in the real estate sector, including the control of rent and the completion of the unfair tax cuts.
It also intends to give the councils (electors) more power to build new homes.
Ms May said: "Last year I realized that I would dedicate my entire prime to the British dream, and that life would be better for the next generation.
And that means we're going to react to the unsatisfactory real estate market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build their lives here.
However, it would not be right if we simplified the procedures for buying real estate to people who do not live in the UK, or to foreign companies, unlike UK residents who work.
For many people, buying a home is a dream come true, and the humiliating nightmare of being under the sun is a reality.
Jack Ross: My greatest ambition is to run Scotland.
Jack Ross, the head of Sunderland, says his greatest ambition is to become the ruler of Scotland at some point.
Scott, 42, enjoys the rebound of the Northeast club, who are currently third in the Premier League, and he has scored three points to his highest point.
This summer he moved to the Stadium of Light under St Mirren for the final season of the Scottish Premiership.
I wanted to represent my country as a player.
I got the B line, which is what I wanted", Ross said in an interview with BBC Scotland Sportsand.
Since I was a kid, I've been watching Scotland's Cup with my dad in Hampden, and it all brings me back to my childhood.
We're only going to use this opportunity to run the club if I succeed.
Ross's predecessors at Sunderland were the lawyer Dick, David Moyes, three Allardys, Martin O'Neill, Roy Kane, Gus Poyet, and Paulo Di Canio.
Alloa Athletic's former manager has said he was not uncomfortable with such famous faces at a major club, and has previously declined Barnsley and Ipswich Town's initiatives.
Is my success at this point in time based on my desire to bring this club back to the Premier League?
If you look at the structure of this club and the infrastructure, it's definitely a place in the Premier League, he says.
It's not an easy task, but I probably consider myself a successful manager, my club will be in the Premier League.
Ross began his managerial career three years ago, first as an assistant manager at Dubuarton and then spent 15 months on the coaching staff at Hearts.
He later helped the All-African League to promotion to the Third Division and won the Championship title for St Mirren the following season.
And Ross says he's feeling better than he did before when he played for Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
He remembers it as a real crossroads.
Well, I really believe that management is the right move, much more correct than playing.
It's weird, but I feel good, I'm making a reasonable income, and I've reached certain heights.
But the game is difficult.
You've got a lot of challenges to overcome in a week.
I deal with the stress and pressure that is characteristic of my job, but I still feel I'm not good at management.
I've always been attracted to management, and I'm really into it now.

According to a study, Saturday at 5:30 p.m. is a great time for painting.
The hot summer nights boosted the revenue of British pubs, but the burden on restaurant chains.
Pubs and bars saw sales rise 2.7 percent in July, but restaurant revenue fell 4.8 percent, according to estimates.
Peter Martin, CGA business consultant who carried out the calculation, says: "Continued warm weather and England's surprise World Cup performance were the same in July as last month when club revenue rose 28 percent and restaurants saw a bigger loss.
The decline in restaurant sales in June by 1.8 percent was even worse in July.
Bar and pubs selling drinks have been stepping up their position in proportion to the decline in restaurant ratings.
Food-shop pubs suffered from the heat, but not as badly as restaurant operators.
It seems that the citizens simply wanted to drink.
While drinks sales in bars and pubs increased by 6.6 percent in one month, food sales fell by three percent.
Paul Newman, a tourism analyst at RSM, said: "These results continue the trend we set at the end of April.
The impact of weather and major social or sporting events are important factors in domestic sales.
There's no doubt that restaurant groups will continue to struggle, as their sales are falling 4.8 percent a year, which is especially painful in the current tax bracket.
A long hot summer is not a good time for grocery operators, and time will tell us whether the moderate temperatures expected in August will provide the basis for breathing.
Total sales growth in pubs and restaurants, including newly renovated facilities, reached 2.7 percent in July, reflecting a slowdown in brand development.
Coffer Peach Tracker monitors sales in the UK pub, bar and restaurant sector, collecting and analysing information from 47 operating groups with a combined turnover of over £9 billion and a defined industry focus.
One in five children has a secret social account that they hide from their parents.
According to a recent study, one in five children under the age of 11 has a secret social account hidden from their parents and teachers.
A study of 20,000 high school students found an increase in fake Instagram profiles.
The news has raised fears that sexual content will be published
And 20 percent of the students surveyed said they have a root page for their parents to show.
One in five children, some of them under the age of 11, create a social media account that their parents hide.
A study of 20,000 high school students found an increase in fake Instagram profiles.
The news has raised fears that sexual content will be published.
Twenty percent of students say they use a clean-root account to show their parents, and they also have their own personal accounts.
A parent found his 13-year-old daughter on a secret site where she was offering to rape her.
According to a study by the UK's Digital Technology Consciousness Workshop and the Directorate of Independent Schools, 40 per cent of pupils aged 11 to 18 use two profiles, and half of them have been granted permission to use personal profiles.
HMC Director Mike Buchanan said: "It's alarming that so many teenagers are exploring online space that their parents and teachers are not aware of.
Eid Doyle will become the sportsman's replacement in Scotland's powerhouse.
Eild Doyle was elected to the Scottish Strength Council as a non-executive director of the Annual General Meeting governing body.
Doyle is a well-known Scottish strength and conditioning coach and chairman, and Ian Beatt described this move as a good opportunity for those who want to benefit from the sport over the past decade on the basis of his extensive international experience.
Jailyd is highly respected in Scotland, the UK and the world's power community, and we are confident that her appointment to the council will be beneficial to Scottish athletes", said Beattle.
Doyle said he was delighted to be able to act as an athlete and hoped to make a significant contribution to the sport in Scotland.
The American, who ran the 200m and 400m at the 1996 Atlanta Games and is a four-time Olympic gold medalist, is now a regular BBC commentator, having trouble moving after a transitional Islamian attack.
She tweeted: "I had a stroke just a month ago.
I needed a move.
Doctors say that time will tell us when and how much I will recover.
Through hard work, I have made a full recovery, learned to walk, and now I live an active life.
Thank you for your encouraging messages!"
A breastfeeding commercial that compares a mother to a cow is sharing the idea online.
The breastfeeding company has shared its opinion online through an advertisement that compares breastfeeding cows to fat cows.
To mark the new launch, as it is said to be "the world's first silent breast tube", consumer technology company Elvie has released a promotional video in the style of a music video used to show the freedom that the new tube gives to breastfeeding mothers.
Four real mothers dancing in a cow's nest full of hay, against the background of a song that includes the words, "Yes, I breastfeed myself, but you can't see the cuddle" and "If you haven't noticed, these aren't jeans, these are my breasts".
The team goes on, "Amotumba, amotumba, I eat this to the children, amotumba, amotumba, I chew on my ladies".
However, the ad posted on the company's Facebook page sparked controversy online.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video received a mixed response from viewers, and many said it sheds light on the "horrors" of the dairy industry.
"It was a very bad decision to use cows in advertising this product.
For us, they have to get pregnant and give birth to breastfeed, except they give birth to their babies a few days after they are born", writes one.
Elvie's breast tube is unconsciously ruptured in the mammary lining.
Another commented: "The decision is traumatic for both the mother and the child.
But why not use them in breastfeeding ads for those who are having babies?
Someone added, "That's a very inappropriate ad".
One woman admits that she thought the song was "humorous".
"I think this is a brilliant idea.
I would have one if I was a mammoth.
When I was getting high, I felt like a real cow.
The ad is a little crazy, but I got it as it was.
It's a brilliant product", one wrote.
Another commented: "This is a funny ad for mothers who are milking (often at work or in the bathroom) and feel like cows".
This is not an advertisement that makes or judges the dairy industry".
The video ends with women dancing with hidden pipes in the strings.
The concept behind the campaign is that most women who are getting older say they feel like cows.
And Elvie's tube is completely hollow, with no ropes or wires, and a slightly creased leaf, which allows women to move freely, hold their children in their hands, and even go outside during a walk.
Anna Ballarin, partner and ECD mother commented: "Elvie's pipe is such a revolutionary product that it deserves to be bold and provocative.
As we crossed the line between female self-expression and mating cows, we wanted to pump milk from the breast, and all of its problems came to the forefront, in a fun and exciting way, demonstrating the incredible sense of freedom that a new tube gives us.
This isn't the first time Elvie's drumming has made headlines.
During London Fashion Week, the mother of two children appeared on the podium at a design show by designer Marta Yakubovsky using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children have quietly moved into a tent camp near the Texas border
The number of migrant children in custody has risen sharply, but the monthly border crossing has remained relatively unchanged, in part because the Trump administration has introduced a strict rhetoric and policy that has made it difficult to place children with sponsors.
Traditionally, most sponsors were self-imposed immigrants who feared they would threaten their ability to stay in their country as a step forward in the demand for a child.
The risk increased in June when federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult members of their families would be required to submit fingerprints and pass their data to immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albance, a senior immigration and customs official, testified before Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who had requested sponsorship of a patriotic minor.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had no prior criminal record.
"Approximately 80 percent of those who are sponsors or family members of sponsors are in the country illegally, and a significant proportion of them are criminal residents.
So we will continue to persecute these people", Mr. Albanes said.
To speed up the process, officials have introduced new rules that some of the children must be brought to court within a month of their arrest, rather than 60 days of the previous standard for asylum workers.
Many come to the immigration judge via videoconference rather than in person to declare their legal status.
Those who do not receive assistance are deported immediately.
According to a report from the refugee workers and reports that have emerged from the system over the past few months, the longer children are in prison, the more likely they are to become nervous or depressed, which can lead to violent outbreaks or attempted escape.
Lawyers say these problems have been amplified in larger institutions like the gym, where signs are that the child is more likely to ignore the difficulties of struggling because of his size.
They also added that without giving children enough time to prepare emotionally and to make friends, moving their tents to the city could aggravate the trauma that most already struggle with.
Syria has ordered the US, French and Turkish "occupation forces" to withdraw their troops immediately.
Speaking to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Mu'allem also called for Syrian refugees to return, despite the country's eighth year of war.
Muallem, who is also deputy prime minister, said foreign forces were illegally on Syrian soil on the grounds of fighting terrorism and would be "treated accordingly".
"They must leave immediately and without any conditions", he told the congregation.
Muallem claimed that the "war on terror" in Syria was "almost over", with more than 360,000 people killed and millions displaced since 2011.
He said Damascus would continue "this holy fight until it liberates the entire territory of Syria" from terrorist groups and "any illegal alien presence".
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, mostly training and training both Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs who are fighting President Bashar al-Assad.
France has over 1,000 soldiers in war-torn lands.
As for the refugees, Muallem said that the conditions for their return were good and he blamed "some Western countries" for "inciting irrational fear" that forced them not to return.
"We call on the international community and humanitarian organizations to help them return", he said.
"They are advocating what should be merely a humanitarian issue".
The United States and the European Union warn that Syria will not receive reconstruction aid until a political agreement to end the war between Assad and the opposition is reached.
UN diplomats say the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to create a buffer zone among the last main rebel forces in Idlib has created an opportunity to continue political negotiations.
The Russian-Turkish agreement cancelled a Russian-backed, large-scale attack by Syrian forces on the province of three million people.
However, Muallem stressed that the agreement had "clear terms" and expressed hope that military action would be directed against jihadists, including al-Qaeda-linked Nusra Front fighters, who would "be wiped out".
UN spokesman Staffan de Mistura hopes to convene the first meeting of the new committee soon, which will include representatives of the government and opposition, to develop a post-war constitution and a path to elections for Syria.
Muallem defined the conditions for the Syrian government's participation in the committee, stating that the commission's activities should be limited to "examining the articles of the present constitution" and warned against interference.
Why Trump Will Win a Second Term
With that logic, Mr. Trump will win re-election in 2020 unless, as many liberal viewers hope, he ends the impeachment and scandal of his presidency prematurely.
What would be, beyond any doubt, "the most dramatic end of the presidency!
There's no sign of audience fatigue at this point.
Since 2014, prime-time ratings on CNN have doubled to 1.05 million and nearly tripled to -1.6 million on MSNBC.
According to Nielsen, Fox News has an average of 2.4 million prime-time viewers, up from 1.7 million four years ago, and MSNBC's "Rachel Meadows" has surpassed 3.5 million on the cable newscast's mainstream newscast.
"This is the fire that people are dying for, because this is not what we're hearing". says Neil Baer, director of ABC drama, "The Last Candidate, Cabinet Secretary, becomes president after the attack that destroys the Capitol".

And yet, it goes beyond the knowledge of an informed citizen when you see for six hours a panel of experts debating the deep-field used by Bob Woodward for his book "The Hunger Games", Paul Manafort's $15,000-worth Syracuse leather bomber hat, (a medically-washed outfit, as the Washington Post said) and Storm Daniel's rough descriptions of the results of Trump's anatomy.

Beyond the money, it grew into the Revolutionary House's tough midterm elections.
Not surprisingly, Pennsylvania's 17th Congressional District is suffering from a money shortage, thanks to the restructuring of congressional districts that have held two seats in the same race for the same seat.
This newly renovated suburb of Pittsburgh was met by Democrat House member Connor Lamb, who won a second round of the special election last spring.
Lamb is running against another official, Republican Keith Rothfuss, who now represents the 12th District of old Pennsylvania, which is partly the same as the new 17th.
The maps were reworked when the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old districts were unconstitutional in favor of the Republicans.
The new 17th Tour resulted in a reduction in campaign funding from the party finance department, the Democratic Congressional Commission (DCCC) and the Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamby became famous in Pennsylvania after narrowly winning the general election in March in Pennsylvania's 18th District.
The seat has been held by a Republican for a decade, and President Donald Trump has defeated the county by 20 points.
Political experts have given the Democrats a minor priority.
The United States has lifted the sanctions on El Salvador for its support of China.
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama recognized Beijing with a small amount of land outside Washington
Mr. Trump held a warm meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varella in June 2017 and had a hotel in Panama before the partners expelled the Trump Organization's management team.
State Department officials decided to expel the heads of U.S. diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic, and Panama over "the final decision to deny Taiwan recognition", Department spokesman Heather Navert said earlier this month.
But the fines were only for El Salvador, which received $140 million in U.S. aid in 2017, including drug control, development and economic support.
The proposed fines, which include a reduction in financial aid and targeted visa restrictions, would be painful for Central American countries and their high unemployment and murder rates.
In line with the development of local meetings, North American and Central American officials moved to a high-level conference focused on security and economic well-being, following meetings like last year as a step forward in preventing immigration to the United States.
But by mid-September, administration officials had made it clear that they wanted the conference to move forward and actually stopped discussing the fine for El Salvador.
Diplomats said Vice President Mike Pence will now speak at a conference scheduled for mid-October as a sign that the administration is changing meeting places.
And three American ambassadors returned peacefully to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic, without any further harsh messages or punishments from Washington.
White House Speaker Mr. Bolton declined to comment on the details of the debate, which was described by three American officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss the terms of anonymity in internal discussions.
Their reports were confirmed by a third-party analyst who is close to the administration and also spoke on the terms of anonymity.
The Bible is a book of history.
The next step could be Special Counsel Robert Mueller's report on a possible obstruction of justice for Mr. Trump, which is now well documented in public accounts.
Mr. Mueller also says his investigation is moving forward to determine whether Mr. Trump's campaign was involved in a conspiracy with Russia during our election.
If Congress goes hand in hand, then Mr. Trump himself will be held accountable, just as he is preparing to speak to the electorate, and ultimately to a jury of his colleagues.
That's a lot, and I'm not referring to the idea that Mr. Trump's downfall is inevitable, as are his counterparts in Europe.
We're all going to make choices on both sides of the Atlantic, which will affect the duration of the battle.
In 1938, German officers were ready to take over against Hitler, only the West resisted him, rallied and supported the Czechoslovak troops in Munich.
We lost it and missed the opportunity to avoid the bloodshed.
The course of history revolves around this inflation and the continuing march of democracy, accelerating or delaying.
Americans are facing these turning points today.
What would we do if Mr. Trump removed Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein is already in hot water after the paper reported that last year he decided to secretly sign up for the president and talk about his worthlessness in office.
Mr. Rosenstein says the Times story is wrong.
"How should we react if the recently requested FBI investigation into Brett Kavallo is not complete or fair - or if he has testified in the Supreme Court despite credible allegations of sexual assault and dishonest evidence?
And first of all, will there be a midterm vote for Congress that will bring justice to Trump?
If we pass this test, democracy will last a long winter.
But I believe we can, from the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied the embassy.
He survived, immigrated to America, and 60 years later sent me to light the Sunday candles on this Swiss table.
So as a legacy, how can I not be optimistic about the future?"

Ranger Graham Dorrance is optimistic about the Wayne Rapids game.
On Thursday, the Rangers hosted the Vienna Rapids, knowing that a win against the Austrians, after an impressive draw with Villarreal in Spain earlier this month, would have secured their place in the Europa League Group G.
Due to a knee injury, midfielder Graham Doran, who was out for the first time in the season with a 2-2 draw with Villarreal, failed to make his debut, but he believes that Rangers can use these results as a backdrop for better results in the future.
"It was a good time for us because the villain is a good side", said the 31-year-old.
"We came into the game because we thought we could get something and we got one point.
We might have done something in the end, but in the end, it was a fair result.
They were probably better in the first half, but we came out in the second half and we got better.
Thursday is another big European night.
I hope we can score three points, but it's going to be a tough game because they did a good job in the last game, but with the fans, I'm sure we can make it and get a positive result.
It's been a really tough year, starting with my injuries and ending with the club changes, but now it's an optimistic factor.
The team is good, and the guys are really good at it; the training is good.
I hope we can move on, leave the past behind, and make it work".
Women can't sleep because they're afraid of saving their pensions.
Although the participants had a clear idea of how they wanted to take care of themselves, some of them talked about it with their family members.
About half of the nationwide surveys said they talked to their spouses about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they'd talked to their children about it.
"People want a family member to take care of them, but they don't take a step forward", says Holly Snyder, vice president of life insurance at Nationwide.
That's where we should start.
Tell your spouse and children: You cannot prepare your family to care for you unless you know in advance what you want.
With your counselor and your family, to discuss where and how to get care, because that choice can be a big factor in determining the value.
Get your financial advisor: Your financial advisor can also help you find ways to cover those expenses.
Long-term care funding options can include a traditional long-term insurance policy, a life insurance policy with a hybrid cash value to help cover those expenses, or self-insurance with your own property - while you have the money.
Organize your legal documents: Leave legal battles in the past.
Get a medical representative authorized to approve your representative who will monitor the quality of your medical care and ensure that professionals meet your requirements if you are unable to communicate.
Also, consider the legal authority of your finances.
You have to choose a trusted person who makes financial decisions and pays taxes if you don't become competent.

A man fired a number of pneumatic guns at Ilfracombe.
The man was shot multiple times with a pneumatic pistol when he was returning home at night.
The 40-year-old victim was in Oxford Grouse in Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, abdomen and arm.
Officials said the shooting, which occurred at about 2:30 BST, was a "coincident".
The victim was never seen by his attacker.
His injuries are not life-threatening, and the police have begun looking for witnesses.
The earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia.
Officials say at least 384 people have died in the powerful earthquake and tsunami that struck the Indonesian city of Palus on Friday, and the death toll is expected to rise.
Due to the disruption of communication, officials could not receive information from the administration of Donggala, an area north of Palau, near the epicenter of the 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
More than 16,000 people have been evacuated in Palos since the disaster.
Here are some important facts about Palo and Dongala, Sulawesi Islands:
Palau is the capital of the province of Central Sulawesi, located at the end of a narrow district on the western coast of Sulawesi Island, with a population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city was celebrating the 40th anniversary of the earthquake and tsunami.
Donggala is located on the northeastern coast of Sulawesi Island, more than 300 km (180 mi) off the coast.
The administration, the administrative region below the province, had a population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture are the main destinations of Central Sulawesi province, especially the Donggala coastal area.
Nickel mining is also important in the province, but is mostly concentrated in Moraval, on the Sulawesi coast.
According to the Indonesian Disaster Management Agency, the tsunami has struck Palau and Tonga several times in the past 100 years.
In 1938, the tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggala.
A tsunami also struck the western Donga in 1996, killing nine
Indonesia is located in the seismic Pacific Ocean, where earthquakes occur regularly.
There have been several major earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: On August 26, an earthquake along the western coast of Aceh province, northern Sumatra, Indonesia, caused a tsunami that devastated 14 countries, killing 226,000 people along the Indian Ocean coast.
2005: In late March and early April, a series of powerful earthquakes hit the western coast of Sumatra.
Hundreds of people died on Nia Island off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A magnitude 6.8 earthquake struck the most populous island of Indonesia, southeast of Japan, causing a tsunami that destroyed the southern coast, killing about 700 people.
2009: A magnitude 7.6 earthquake struck near Padang, the capital of Western Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: A 7.5-magnitude earthquake struck Sumatra, on the island of Mentawai, triggering a 10-meter-high tsunami that destroyed dozens of villages and killed 300 people.
2016: A weak earthquake occurs in the Pidey Jaya administration in Aceh, causing devastation and panic as people are reminded of the devastation caused by the 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
This time, there was no tsunami, but more than 100 people died in the damaged buildings.
2018: More than 500 people died in a powerful earthquake on the Indonesian tourist island of Lombok, mostly in the north of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of tourists in the area
Sarah Palin's eldest son was arrested for domestic violence.
The eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, Trey Palin, has been arrested on charges of assault.
Pauline, 29, of Vassilla, Alaska, was arrested on charges of domestic violence that contradict the report on domestic violence and resistance to arrest, according to a report released by the U.S. Marshals Service in Alaska.
According to a police report, when a woman he knew tried to call the police and report a suspected crime, she took her phone from her hand.
According to KTUU, Pauline Mat-Su is in the detention center and is under $500 bail.
When he appeared in court on Saturday, when he was asked to plead guilty, he declared himself completely innocent, the networks reported.
Pauline faces a sentence of three Class A misdemeanors, which carries a maximum of one year in prison and a $250,000 fine.
He's also charged with a Class B misdemeanor, which means one day in jail and a $2,000 fine.
This is not the first criminal case against a defendant.
In December 2017, he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palm, called the police to report an alleged attack.
The case is now before the Alaska Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, forgery of a report of domestic violence and possession of a firearm in a state of disrepair in connection with the incident.
Her boyfriend claimed she was hit in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veterans groups in 2016 after being linked to her son's violent behavior with post-traumatic stress disorder caused by her service in Iraq.
The earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia: Hundreds of people died
At least 384 people have died in the earthquake that struck Sulawesi, Indonesia, on Friday.
A 7.5-magnitude earthquake caused a tsunami that destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks are down, and the death toll is expected to rise in the coming days.
The earthquake struck in the center of Sulawesi, north of Jakarta, the capital of Indonesia.
Social media is spreading videos that show the events.
Hundreds of people gathered for a beach festival in Palos when the tsunami hit the beach.
The federal prosecutor's office opts for a rare death sentence for a suspected terrorist attack in New York City.
The New York State Attorney's Office is seeking the death penalty for a suspected mail fraud in the New York City terror attack that killed eight people - the rare death penalty imposed by the state for a federal crime since 1953.
The 30-year-old suspect, reportedly in October, used a rented car from Home Depot to attack pedestrians, walkers and cyclists along the West Side of lower Manhattan.
To seek the death penalty, prosecutors must prove that the robbery "intentionally" killed eight people and "intentionally" caused serious bodily harm to people, according to a written request for the death penalty in the Southern District of New York.
Both of them are facing a possible death sentence, according to court documents.
A few weeks after the attack, a federal grand jury indicted 22 people, including eight of the murder victims, on charges of ganglandism used by federal prosecutors in organized crime, violence and car wrecking.
The prosecutor's office said the attack required "detailed planning and planning", describing how it was "abused with disgust, violence and brutality".
"The discovery of the Saiful Khabatvavich site has caused damage and loss to families and friends of Diego Enrique Angel, Nicolas Clevens, Am-Laura Decad, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Herman Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucho, the message of the intentions of the states.
Five of the victims were Argentine tourists.
It's been 10 years since the Southern District of New York has had a criminal case involving the death penalty.
Defendant Khalid Barnes was convicted of killing two drug dealers, but was eventually sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last time a death sentence was carried out in New York City was in the 1953 federal case of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple accused of spying for the Soviet Union two years earlier during the Cold War.
Both Rosenbergs were executed in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
A native of Uzbekistan, Saif, did not express deep regret after the attack that day and several months later, according to court documents.
According to police, he told investigators that he did what he did well.
According to the indictment, Saifov told authorities that he was inspired by watching ISIS video on his phone.
He also demanded the ISIS flag be dropped in a hospital room, police said.
He pleaded not guilty to the charges of 22 pounds.
David Patton, one of the federal prosecutors in the city, said they were "clearly disappointed" with the prosecutor's decision.
"We think that the death penalty, not life in prison without amnesty, will only prolong the trauma of all those involved in this incident", Patton said.
The prize winning team had earlier asked the prosecutors not to apply for the death penalty.
A Tory MP has said Nigel Farage should be in charge of Brexit negotiations.
Nigel Farage pledged to "mobilise the People's Army" today at a conference in Toru during a protest.
The former British leader said politicians "must feel the heat" from the euro - as parliamentarian Theresa May suggested, she should be responsible for negotiations with the EU.
Conservative MP Peter Bon, in Birmingham, said Britain would be "already gone" if Mr Farage was Brexit secretary.
But the challenge that Ms May faces, in line with her sharply stated claims, has been highlighted by the pro-Remain Tory, who joined the separate protest against Brexit.
The Prime Minister is trying to keep his Chechnya's compromised plan against attacks by the Brexiteers, Remainers and the EU.
The allies claimed that he would continue to try to negotiate with Brussels despite the negative reaction - and force Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between his package and "chaos".
Mr. Bon announced during the Leave Means Leave protest in Solihull that he wanted to get rid of the Chechers.
He offered Mr Farage to become a colleague and take responsibility for the negotiations with Brussels.
"If he were responsible, we would be out now", she said.
The Wellingborough MP added: "I'm for Brexit, but we need to get rid of the checks.
When confronted by the European Union, he said, 'We did not fight world wars to be submissive.
We want to make our own laws in our country".
Mr. Bon rejected speculation that public opinion had changed since 2016: 'The idea that the British people have changed their minds and should remain is a complete lie.'
Tory Brexiteer Andrew Jenkins was also at the march and he told reporters, "I'm just saying, Prime Minister, listen to the people.
"Czech is unpopular in society, the opposition is not going to vote for it, it's unpopular among our party and our activists who actually take to the streets and judge us first.
Please, put down your keys and start listening.
In a sharp message from Mrs May, she added: "Prime Ministers keep their jobs when they keep their promises".
Mr Farage said politicians should feel the heat", if they are going to overturn the 2016 referendum.
'It's a matter of trust between us now - the people - and our political class,' he said.
"They're trying to break Brexit, and today we're here to say, 'We're not going to let you do that.'"
In a message to the enthusiastic crowd, he added: "I want our political class, which is on the brink of Brexit betrayal, to feel the heat.
"We are mobilizing the people's army of this country, which defeated us in Brexit, and will not rest until we become an independent, self-governing and glorious United Kingdom".
Meanwhile, the Remainers marched through Birmingham for two hours into the city centre.
Several activists have been banning the Tories against Brexit after launching groups this week.
Labour's Lord Adon mocked the Conservatives for the security issues they face when opening the conference after the party's app launches.
"These are the people who told us that they could invent IT systems on the ground and all the technology for Canada plus, no-conflict borders, no-conflict free trade in Ireland", he added.
"This is a complete farce.
There is no good Brexit, he said.
Warren plans to "watch closely" the presidential campaign.
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren has said that after the November election, she will "watch closely" the presidential race.
The Boston Globe reports that a Massachusetts Democrat spoke about his future on Saturday in West Massachusetts' Rattusa.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, is running for re-election in November against Republican Jeff Dille, who co-chaired Trump's Massachusetts campaign in 2016.
He was at the center of speculation that Trump might get in 2020.
On Saturday afternoon, the Holyooks held their 36th Ratous-style meeting with voters since Trump took office.
The audience asked if he would run for president.
Warren said it was time for women to go to Washington and build a broken government, and that includes a woman at the head of the government.
There was an arrest at LSU in the shooting that ended with the deaths of the Sims.
In Baton Rouge, Louisiana, police said on Saturday they've arrested a suspect in the shooting of Wade Sims, a LSU basketball player, Friday.
The Mr. Rouse Police Department announced the arrest of 20-year-old Dayton Simpson at 11:00 a.m. at a press conference on ET.
On Friday, they released a video of the shooting, asking for help identifying the culprit.
Sims, 20, was shot and killed on the university's South Campus on Friday afternoon.
"Wade Sims was shot in the head with a gunshot wound, killing him", police chief Morphy J. Paul told 247 sports journalists on Saturday.
Wade defended his friend and was killed by the Simpson.
Simpson was questioned, and he confessed to being at the scene, holding a gun, and shooting Wade Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and was taken into custody at the East Baton Rouge County Police Department.
The 6-foot-6, 6-inch youngster, who grew up in Baton Rouge, played in 32 games last season with 10 starts and averaged 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Louis Hamilton approaches the World Cup title after the team demands that he win against Sebastian Vettel.
It was reported from the last moment that Walter Bottas was ahead of Louis Hamilton on Saturday, and Mercedes' orders played a big part in the race.
Bottas got off to a good start, almost beating Hamilton after he defended his position in the first two rounds and led Vettel to his teammates' attack.
Vettel was the first to enter Pittsburgh and left Hamilton to settle a traffic group code, which was to be crucial.
Mercedes entered the circuit late and left the rear of the Vettel, but Hamilton came out ahead after several laps of the wheel collided, causing the Ferrari driver to reluctantly leave the interior free, at the risk of holding back after a double turn to defend in the third corner.
Max Verstappen started from the back row and finished seventh on his 21st birthday at the end of the first round.
He then ran much of the race over his salt to finish fast and crossed Kim Reikon's line of fourth place.
He eventually made it to round 44 of the boxing, but failed to improve pace in the remaining eight rounds and Reikonen finished fourth.
It's a tough day because Walter did a fantastic job for a week and turned out to be a real gentleman, so tell me what to do about it.
The team did exceptionally well, losing first and second place", Hamilton said.
That was a really bad way to put it.
President Donald Trump blamed Senator Diana Feinstein for failing to deliver a letter from Christina Blesford in which Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh was charged with sexual assault.
Speaking at a meeting in West Virginia, the president did not directly testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee about Ford, instead commenting that events in the Senate showed that people were "disgusting, disgusting, and deceitful".
"The only thing that can happen and the wonderful thing that's been going on in the Senate for the last few days is when you see anger, when you see people who are angry and disgusting and disgusting and cheating", he said.
"When you see the releases and the leaks and when they say, 'Oh, I didn't do it.
I didn't do that".
Do you remember?
Diana Feinstein, have you released the information?
Remember his answer-- I didn't have a letter left -- "Oh, oh, what?
Oh, no, I did not.
I'm not going to leave".
Then wait a minute.
We spread... No, we didn't", he added, with impressions from the senator.
A letter was sent to Feinstein detailing the charges brought against Kavanaugh by Ford in July, which were uncovered in early September - but Feinstein denies the leak came from his office.
"I have not been informed of Dr. Ford's allegations, nor have I been informed of any other matter, to be referred to the Feinstein Committee", Hill said.
"He told me it was confidential, and I took it confidentially, as he asked".
But his refusal seems to have displeased the president, who responded at the meeting on Saturday, "I'll tell you, it was a really bad gesture.
It may not have been done, but it was the worst gesture I've ever seen".
By continuing to defend the Supreme Court's candidacy for the three women who have been accused of sexual assault, the president has said Democrats are using the charges for their own ends.
"They're trying to get back to power by any means.
You see the disgust, the disgust, they just care who they hurt, who they put in over their heads to gain power and control, MediaTimes reports.

Patrick Dwyer scored two goals against Dundee for the Giants.
The Dandee Stars have won their Elite League game on Friday against the Belfast Giants on Saturday in a 5-3 win over the Dandee.
The Giants soon took a two-point lead thanks to the goals of Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauiller.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cooney took it to the hosting level before Duvier reestablished leadership for the Giants.
Francois Boucher tied the score with Dandé before Lucas Lundwald Nilsson scored two goals to win.
It was the third Elite League defeat of the season for the Adam Kiffe people who came from far away to watch Dundee beat Belfast 2-1 on Friday night.
It was the fourth meeting of the season where the Giants had won their last three games.
Dwyer scored the opening goal in the fourth, 3:35 thanks to a pass by Kendall McFall, a pass by David Rutherford, and Bowie doubled the gap four minutes later.
After the opening minutes, Sullivan kicked a ball to the hosts at 13:10 of the game before Matt Marquard helped Cohn tie the score at 15:16.
Before the break, Dwyer led the Giants to another victory when he scored the second goal just after the end of the first half.
The hosts regrouped and Bouchard returned the game with a strong 27-37 lead.
The combination of Cooney and Charles Corcoran helped Nilsons to lead Dundee to the second half for the first time in the match and he led his team to victory, finishing fifth in the final.
The Giants, who have lost four of their last five games, will play their home games at Milton Keynes on Friday.
A flight attendant dies to save hundreds of people on board the plane from an earthquake
In Indonesia, a flight attendant was posthumously hailed as a hero after he secured a safe landing for hundreds of people.
More than 800 people have died and many are missing after the tsunami that struck Sulawesi on Friday.
The area is still experiencing strong underground tremors and many have been reared in the ruins of the city of Palo.
But even though his colleagues fled to save their lives, 21-year-old Antonio Gunavar Agung refused to leave the post office in the control tower, which was heavily quarried at Muteara Si Al Jaffra Palos Airport.
He remained in place to ensure safe flight for the Batik Air Flight 6321 aircraft that was on the runway at the time of the flight.
Then he came down from the air tower when he thought he was going to crash.
He later died in hospital.
According to the Indonesian Air Navigation Commissioner Johannes Sirait, the decision saved hundreds of lives, ABC News reported in Australia.
We prepared a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take him to another city, a larger hospital.
Unfortunately, he died the morning before the helicopter reached Palos.
"We were very happy to hear about this", he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear that the death toll will rise to thousands, as the Disaster Relief Agency says access to Donggala, Siji and Butong cities is restricted.
"The number of casualties is expected to continue to rise, as many bodies were still under the rubble and many were still unreachable", said a spokesman for the government of Sudope Puervo Nuguero.
Waves that reached six meters destroyed the palace, which will lead to a mass burial on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft are being supplied with aid and supplies.
A 35-year-old mother, Riza Kusuma, told Sky News: "Every minute, ambulances are bringing bodies.
Clean water is not enough".
Minimarketers have been stolen everywhere".
Ian Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is rushing to help the survivors, but we don't know what they're going to see there.
"It's a tragedy, but it could have been worse".
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palo and told the country's armed forces, "I urge all of you to work day and night to complete all the evacuation tasks.
Are you ready?" reports CNN.
In Indonesia, earlier this year, an earthquake in Lombok killed more than 550 people.
Air Newgin reports that one person has been missing since a plane crashed in Laguna.
The airline, which operated a flight to Pacific Lagoon, Micronesia, is now reporting one person missing after it finally announced that all 47 passengers and crew had escaped safely from the sinking plane.
Ayr Nugini told a news release that on Saturday afternoon, he was unable to accurately estimate male passengers.
The airline says it's been working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to find the man.
The airline did not provide timely details of the passengers, such as age or nationality.
Local boats helped rescue other passengers and crew after the plane crashed into the water while attempting to land at Chucky Island Airport.
Officials said Friday that seven people were taken to hospital.
The airline said six passengers were hospitalized on Saturday and all were in stable condition.
The exact sequence of events remains unclear.
The airline and the United States Navy said the plane landed in Laguna near the runway.
Some witnesses thought the plane was trying to fly the runway.
American traveler Bill Gaines said the plane was flying too low.
"It's really good", says Janey.
Janees said that she and others managed to get out of the water-filled plane that was still sinking for a year, the escape route.
He said the crew were panicking and screaming, and that he had suffered a minor injury.
The United States Navy said sailors at a nearby dock also assisted in the rescue process, moving passengers to the shore of the passenger boat before the plane sank to a depth of 30 meters (100 feet).
According to the Air Safety Network, 111 people have died in PNG-registered airline crashes over the past two decades, but none of them were connected to Air Newgin.
The analyst gives the timeline of the night the woman was burned alive.
Prosecutors on Saturday opened a case against a man charged with the 2014 murder of a woman in Mississippi for burning her alive.
Paul Rowlett, an analyst at the United States Department of Justice, has been presenting for hours as an expert in intelligence analysis.
He told the jury how he used cell phone records to bring together the timeline of the movements of 29-year-old accused Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers on the night of the murder.
Rowlett said he received location data from several cell phones that showed Teles and Jessica were together the night of his death, contrary to his previous statements, Clarion Ledger reports.
When the data showed that his cell phone was with Chambers, when he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford at the time, the police went to Sanford to talk to him.
Sanford gave a speech on Saturday and confirmed that he was not in town that day.
When prosecutors asked if T.V. was telling the truth when he said he was in a Sanford truck at night, Sanford said he cheated because my truck was in Nashville.
Another inconsistency was that Tell told me that she knew the shooter for about two weeks at the time of his death.
Cell phone records indicate they only knew each other for a week.
Rowlett said that some time after Chambers' death, Teles deleted Chambers' messages, calls, and contact information from her phone.
"He took her out of his life", Hale said.
The defenders should begin their final arguments this week.
The judge said that the trial should be postponed to a later date.
The High Breed: What is conscious hip hop?
The hip hop trio wants to challenge the genre's negative outlook by adding positive messages to their music.
The High Breed, from Bristol, claim that hip hop is far from political ideas and social problems.
They want to get back to their roots and make conscious hip-hop popular again.
Artists like Fugees and Common have recently become part of the UK Renaissance thanks to artists like Akala and Lowkey.
Another black man?!
A sister in New York City sued a couple for "racist" lyrics
A New York City nursing home sued the couple for discriminatory removal from office after receiving a misjudged text from her mother, in which she was accused of being "another black person".
The spouses deny that they are racist, comparing the lawsuit to "exclusion".
Lynce Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, expressed concern when it was discovered that the new childcare provider, Jill Morris, was black when she arrived on her first day of work in 2016.
"There is no other black person", Ms. Placco-Flaxman wrote to her husband in a text.
However, instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it to Mrs. Morris twice.
After realizing the mistake, a frustrated Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman released Mrs. Moore, saying that their estranged brother, an African-American, was doing his job poorly and instead was expecting the Philippines, the New York Post reported.
His mom was paid for a day's work, and then he was sent home in an Uber.
Now Morris is suing the couple for compensation for his release and demanding compensation of $350 a day for the six-month period he was originally hired for, but without a contract.
"I want to show them, watch out, not to do anything like that", he told the Post on Friday, adding, "I know this discrimination".
The couple responded to accusations that they were racist by saying that releasing Morris was reasonable, fearing they could no longer trust Maddie after being abused.
"My husband sent her something she didn't want to say.
He's not racist.
We are not racist people", said husband Joel Plasco in the Post.
"But would you be able to give your children to those you were being rude to, even if it was a mistake?
Your newborn child?
"What is it?"
Comparing the lawsuit with the "expulsion", Plasco stated that his wife was only two months pregnant and was in a very difficult condition.
"Would you go with someone like that?
It's not a very pleasant job", added the investment banker.
While the trial is still ongoing, the court of public opinion immediately sent the couple to social media, where they were accused of behavior and logic.
The publishers of Paddington feared that readers would not be positive about the speaker, says the new letter.
Bond's daughter Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was published, wrote: "It's hard to imagine yourself as someone else when you first read it before it's published.
It's really exciting to know that we know about Paddington's huge success".
To say that her father, who worked as a BBC operator before he was inspired to write a book about a small toy farm, would be optimistic, because his work was rejected, and he added that the book's 60th anniversary was "sweet-hearted" a year after his death.
Regarding Paddington, whom he refers to as "a very important member of our family", he added that his father quietly talked about his possible success.
"He was a rather calm person and he was not a selfish person", she said.
"But because Paddington was so real to him, it's almost like having a child who describes success: you're proud of it, but it's not really what you do.
I think that's how he viewed Paddington's success.
Even though it was his design and his idea, he always respected Paddington himself".
My son was dying, and I got a phone call to say goodbye.
On the flight, his daughter was rushed to the Nice Louis Pasteur 2 hospital, where doctors tried unsuccessfully to save her.
"She didn't regularly say that it was really bad, that she didn't want to do it", says Mrs. Ednan-Laperoy.
"Then Nadine called me and said that she was going to die in two minutes and I had to say goodbye to her.
And I did that.
I said, "I love you so much, babe.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The medications doctors gave her for her heartbeat were slowly decaying and leaving her body.
He died and everything went wrong.
I just had to sit back and wait, knowing that this was all over.
I couldn't cry or cry or cry because I was surrounded by family and close people.
I had to keep it all inside of me".
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperois, mourning the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane with the other passengers - despite the severe ordeal that had befallen her.
"No one knew", she said.
"I was so upset and I kept crying.
It's hard to describe, but it was during that flight that I felt the tremendous compassion for Nad.
I knew she needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much she loved him".
Open cards for grieving women to end suicide on bridges.
Two women who have lost loved ones to suicide are working to eradicate the suicide of others.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphrey placed messages on the Wells Bridge with soul-saving messages and phone numbers where people could call for help.
Mrs. Davis' son, Tyler, was 13 when he began to suffer from depression and committed suicide at age 18.
"I don't want any parent to feel the way I feel every day", she said.
Mrs. Davis, 45, who lives in Lydney, said her son was a promising chef with a smile.
"Everybody knew him with a smile.
They always said that her smile would light up any room".
But before he died, he quit his job because he was "in a really dark place".
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 at the time, discovered that his brother had committed suicide.
Ms. Davis says, "I'm constantly worried that it won't work.
Ms. Davis created these cards so people knew that there were people you could go to and talk to, even if they were your friends.
Do not be silent - you need to talk".
Mrs. Humphrey, who had been a friend of Mrs. Davis for many years, lost her partner of 15 years, Mark, shortly after her mother's death.
"She didn't tell him that she felt bad or depressed or anything like that", he said.
"A few days before his birth, we noticed a change in his personality.
On Christmas Day, when the children were giving away their gifts, he didn't even look at them.
She said her death was a huge blow to them, but they have to let it go: "It's a big hole in the family.
We'll bring her to tears.
But we all have to keep going and fight".

Brett Kavanaugh's future is on the grass, and the FBI is investigating.
"I thought that by doing what he asked - a limited investigation in time, within a limited framework - we could have some unity", Mr. Flake said on Saturday, adding that he feared the committee would break down on the platform of a party splinter.
Why didn't Mr. Kavalo and his Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate?
They didn't want to because of the weather.
Interim elections are in five weeks, on November 6th -- if the Republicans go as expected, they'll be seriously weakened in their efforts to get the person they should be electing to the nation's highest court.
George Bush took the phone and called the senators, lobbying them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked at the White House during Bush's time, and that he met his wife's uncle while she was Bush's private secretary.
What happens after the FBI prepares its report?
The vote will be held in the Senate, which currently has 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It's not clear whether Mr. Kavanaugh will receive at least 50 votes in a Senate hearing that would allow Vice President Mike Pence to dissolve the union and affirm it in the Supreme Court.
The number of North Korean rebels is falling under the Kim regime
Since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, the number of North Korean rebels to South Korea has declined, South Korean lawmakers said.
Park Byeong-seug, based on data from the Union Ministry of the South, says there were 1,127 layoffs last year, up from 2,706 in 2011.
Mr Park said the tightening of border controls between North Korea and China and high tariffs imposed by counter-terrorists were important factors.
Pyongyang has not made any public comments.
The vast majority of North Korean citizenship is finally offered to South Koreans.
Seoul claims that more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the Korean War ended in 1953.
Most pass through China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the reliably defended demilitarized zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China considers displaced persons illegal immigrants, not refugees, and often forces them to return.
Relations between the North and the South, which are still at war, have improved dramatically in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang for talks focused on halting nuclear weapons.
This was after a historic meeting in Singapore in June between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un, when they generally agreed to work on the Korean Peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed U.S. sanctions for the lack of progress since then.
"Without trust in the United States, there will be no trust in our national security, and in such a situation, we cannot unilaterally disarm", Mr. Rhim said in his speech to the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh a "historian", and says she's not fit to serve on the Supreme Court.
Minority leader Nancy Pelosi calls Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh a "candidate" and says he is unfit to serve on the Supreme Court because of the temperature.
Pelosi commented in an interview on Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I couldn't, but I think if a woman had acted like her husband, they would have called her 'hysterical,'" Pelosi said of her reaction to the Canadian show before the Senate Judiciary Committee.
Kavanagh emotionally denied allegations that he had sexual relations with Dr. Christina Blesford in her youth.
His introduction was very emotional, sometimes almost screaming and drowning while talking about his family and school days.
He also specifically condemned the Democrats on the committee and called the accusations of his husbands a "coordinated murder of a group of people" organized by angry liberals that Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said he believed Kavanaugh's testimony confirmed that he could not work in the Supreme Court because it showed that he was anti-democratic.
"I think he's disqualifying himself with these statements and the way he went after Clinton and the Democrats", he said.
Pelosi was upset when asked if he would try Kavanaugh's impeachment, if he did, and if the Democrats would win a majority in the House.
"I'll say this -- if he doesn't tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, then he's not just fit for the Supreme Court, but for the court he's in now", Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat, he was concerned about Kavanaugh's potential decisions against the Affordable Care Act or Roy W. Wade because he was considered a conservative judge.
At the hearing on the issue of his confirmation, Kavanaugh avoided questions about whether he would overturn any of the Supreme Court's decisions.
"This is not the time for a hysterical, biased person to go to court and expect us to say how beautiful", said Pelosi.
And women should use it.
It's a fair talk, a brass-blowing for months and years, and she can't show it without tears.
"We cry when we are angry", Mr. Steinmeier told me 45 years later.
"I don't think this is unusual, do you?"
She continued, "I was a great help to a woman in government somewhere who said that she was crying when she was angry, too, but she developed a technique that meant that when she was angry and she started crying, she would say to the person she was talking to, 'You might think I'm upset because I'm crying.
I'm angry with you".
And then he just kept going.
And I thought it was great".
Tears are allowed in part as an expression of anger because they're fundamentally misunderstood.
One of my most bitter memories of an early job where men dominated was when I once discovered that an old lady was crying over an unwritten rage, and she was pushing me on the bench -- a cold manager I was always afraid of -- and she was walking me down the stairs.
"Never be seen crying", she told me.
"They don't know you're angry.
They think you're bored and they'll be happy to get what they want".
Patricia Schrader, then a Democratic congresswoman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart during his presidential campaign.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught out of wedlock on a boat called Monkey Business, and left the race, Mrs. Schrader, very disappointed, decided that there was no reason why she should not resign her own presidential candidacy.
"It was not a well-thought-out decision", she laughed at me 30 years later.
"The Asparagus had a son who was already a candidate, and they wanted the least of it to be another candidate.
Someone said, "Sweetie and her baby is a bitch".
Because it was too late for the campaign and he was behind the fundraiser, he promised not to participate in the campaign unless he raised $2 million.
It was a losing battle.
He found that some of his supporters, who gave men $1,000, gave him only $250.
"Do they think I'm getting a discount?" he asked.
When he spoke and said he wasn't going to start a formal campaign, he was so overwhelmed by emotions -- gratitude to the people who supported him, frustration with the system that made it harder to raise funds and focus on voters than delegates, and brazen sexism -- that he was brazen.
"You think I had a nervous breakdown", said Mr. Schrader, referring to the press' reaction to him.
"You thought Clinix was my corporate sponsor.
I remember thinking, what would they write on my gravestone?
"She was crying?"
How can a U.S.-China trade war be good for China?
The root causes of the US-China trade war have been shaken, and while the war is still far from over, a cold war between the two countries may be beneficial to Beijing in the long run, experts say.
Donald Trump, the president of the United States, issued his first warning earlier this year, imposing tariffs on major Chinese exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most significant escalation began this week, with new tariffs affecting $200 billion worth of goods, effectively taxing half of all goods imported into the U.S. from China.
Beijing has responded every time, most recently with tariffs of five to 10 percent on US goods worth $60 billion.
China has promised that the U.S. will be cut off from the rest of the world, and the world's second-largest economy is less likely to slow down anytime soon.
Forcing Washington to back down means meeting demand, and bad, for the U.S., publicly turning down might be very uncomfortable for Chinese President Xi Jinping.
However, experts say that if Beijing buys its cards properly, the pressure of the US trade war could have a positive effect on China in the long run, reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
"The fact that a swift political decision in Washington or Beijing could create conditions for a country to start a recession is actually far more dangerous than observers have previously admitted", says Abigail Grace, associate researcher at the New American Security Center, an analytics center focused on Asia.
Syria 'ready' to accept refugees, Foreign Minister says
Syria says it is ready to accept returning refugees and is asking for help to rebuild a war-torn country that has been in ruins for more than seven years.
Speaking to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Muallem said that conditions in the country would improve.
"Today, the situation is more stable on the ground and thanks to the progress made in the fight against safe terrorism", he said.
The government is continuing to rehabilitate areas destroyed by terrorists to restore the normal situation.
Now all the conditions are in place to allow the refugees to return voluntarily to a country that they had to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures that affected their daily lives and their livelihoods.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have been expelled since the war began in 2011.
Another six million people in the country are in need of humanitarian assistance.
Al-Mu'allem said the Syrian regime would be happy to receive help to rebuild the destroyed country.
But he stressed that he would not receive conditional assistance from countries that had funded the rebels.
Europe celebrates the Ryder Cup win in Paris
The European team won the 2018 Ryder Cup, defeating the USA team by a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National outside Paris, France.
The U.S. now has a record six losses on European soil and hasn't won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe regained the crown after captain Thomas Byrne's team scored 14.5 points, which was enough to beat the United States.
U.S. star Phil Michelsson, who had been trying to win most of the tournament, threw his first shot into the water at the 16th hole of the Par-3 before losing to Francesco Molinar.
Italian golfer Molinari excelled in all his rounds, becoming the first player out of four to score 5-0-0 since the tournament's current format was created in 1979.
American Jordan Spit was defeated 5-4 by Torbjörn Olsen, the lowest-ranked Danish player in the European team.
The world's highest-ranked player, Dustin Johnson, has been awarded 2-1 to England's Ian Poulter, who may have played in his final Ryder Cup.
Spanish rider Sergio Garcia, a veteran of the Ryder Cup, won the tournament in all European history with 25.5 points.
"I don't usually cry, but I can't stop now.
It's been a rough year.
So I'm thankful that Thomas took the initiative and trusted me.
I'm happy, I'm so happy to have my cup back.
It's teamwork, and I'm happy to be able to help", said the excited Garcia after winning Europe.
He gave the crown to his fellow golfer John Ramm, who won the week-long American golf legend Tiger Woods 2 and 1 in a single game.
"I feel incredibly proud to have defeated Tiger Woods, I grew up watching this guy", says 23-year-old Rah.
Woods has lost all four games in France and now has a Ryder Cup record of 13-21-3.
The odd statistic of one of the greatest players of all time, with 14 major titles won, is only betting on Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team struggled for a black week to find a goalie, except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas, and Tony Finaus, who played high-caliber golf throughout the tournament.
U.S. captain Jim Furyk said after his team's heartbreaking game, "I'm proud of these guys, they fought.
There was a moment this morning when we were a little bit in Europe.
We were destroyed.
We turned a rock in front of Thomas.
He's a wonderful captain.
His 12 players played well.
We'll regroup, I'll work with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup committee, and we'll move forward.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud to be their captain.
You have to pay your dues.
We are better".
