The Commission shall, by means of implementing acts, adopt delegated acts in accordance with Article 21 of Regulation (EC) No 396/2005 laying down the rules for the application of this Regulation and in accordance with Article 21 of Regulation (EC) No 396/2005 and with Article 21 thereof.
The cumulative incidence of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) cases shows similar trends in the European Union/European Economic Area countries and the United Kingdom, confirming that although it is at a different stage depending on the country, the COVID-19 pandemic is advancing rapidly in all countries.
Based on the experience of Italy, countries, hospitals and UTIs should prepare more for an outbreak of COVID-19 patients who will need care and, above all, intensive care.
On 31 December 2019, a portion of cases of unknown etiology pneumonia were reported in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
On 9 January 2020, the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention reported the causative agent as a new coronavirus, now referred to as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2) coronavirus 2.
Since then, the disease resulting from SARS-CoV-2 infection has been called coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
The evidence so far is that 80% of people with COVID-19 develop a mild form of the disease, that is, a respiratory tract infection with or without pneumonia, and most of them recover.
In about 14% of cases, COVID-19 evolves into a more serious illness, requiring hospitalization, while the remaining 6% of cases evolve into a critical illness, requiring intensive care.
Mortality of hospitalized patients due to COVID-19 is 4%.
In this study, we assessed the trends in the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 in each EU/EEA country and the UK and compared them with those in Hubei Province, China.
We also compared the current number of COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and the UK with that in Italy between 31 January and 15 March 2020.
COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and the UK
After China, COVID-19 spread geographically, and the dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic in the rest of the world currently follow that country's.
On 11 March 2020, the director-general of the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a pandemic.
The March 5 issue of Eurosurveillance 2020 reported the first confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Europe, according to WHO case definition.
In the EU/EEA, the first three confirmed cases were reported by France on 24 January 2020 in people returning from Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
As of 15 March 2020, COVID-19 cases had already been detected in all 30 EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom, and between 31 December 2019 and the above date, 39,768 cases and 1,727 deaths had been reported, with 17,750 cases and 1,441 deaths in Italy alone.
Obtaining cumulative numbers and cumulative incidence of COVID-19 cases
At the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), the number of reported cases of COVID-19 in each country in the world, obtained only from official sources, such as the country's Ministry of Health, national and regional health authorities and WHO, is updated daily at 8 a.m.
This data was used to assess COVID-19 trends in the EU/EEA and the UK and to compare them with those in Italy.
As an approximation of the prevalence of active COVID-19 cases, we calculated the cumulative truncated incidence of 14 days of COVID-19 cases, taking therefore into account the natural evolution of COVID-19 in each EU/EEA country and the UK during the period from 1 January to 15 March 2020.
We also presented the cumulative number of reported cases from each country by 15 March 2020 at 8 a.m. and compared with Italy for the period from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
COVID-19 trends in EU/EEA countries and the UK
Trends in the cumulative 14-day truncated incidence of COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and the UK in general followed those in Hubei Province, China (Figure 1).
In general, for the EU/EEA and the United Kingdom, the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 began to increase around 21 February and increased significantly then around 28 February 2020 (additional material).
This was mainly due to the rapid increase in reported cases in Italy, but all other EU/EEA countries and the UK have shown similar upward trends in cumulative incidence of COVID-19 (additional material).
Figure 2 shows the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom compared to Italy for the period from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
It notes that by 8am on 15 March 15 other EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom had already reported a total number of cases comparable to that of Italy three weeks or less ago.
Our results indicate that the number of reported cases of COVID-19 is increasing rapidly in the EU/EEA and the UK.
The trends observed in the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 suggest that the pandemic is progressing at a similar pace in all countries.
This is despite countries being at different stages, variations in the actions of national public health systems and possibly different case definitions in countries and different protocols for selecting patients to be tested for COVID-19 confirmation, including testing for updates.
In early March 2020, doctors in the affected regions of Italy described a situation in which 10% of COVID-19 patients needed intensive care, and media reported that hospitals and intensive care units in those regions had already reached their maximum capacity.
Data on hospitalization for COVID-19 cases in a hospital and/or an IUT are currently available at EU/EEA level for only 6% and 1% of cases respectively (data not shown).
They should, however, be collected in a systematic manner to complement current surveillance data with a focus on the number of reported cases and the number of deaths.
A study conducted between 2010 and 2011 showed a huge variation in the availability of ICU beds and semi-intensive units in Europe, ranging from 29.2 beds in Germany to 4.2 beds in Portugal for every 100,000 people.
This means that countries may have more or less resources than Italy (12.5 beds of ICU and semi-intensive treatment for a population of 100 000 between 2010 and 2011).
Modelled scenarios related to health system capacity saturation, with estimates for each EU/EEA country and the UK of the prevalence of COVID-19 hospitalization cases associated with a greater risk of 90% of intensive care bed capacity, are provided in the sixth update of the ECDC's rapid COVID-19 risk assessment.
Since cases have so far been concentrated in certain regions of EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom, and hospitals and intensive care units generally serve a defined population of regional scope, information on intensive care cases and beds should be made available preferably in the Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistical Purposes 2 (NUTS-2).
The example of Italy and trends in other countries show that the COVID-19 pandemic is progressing rapidly in the EU/EEA and the UK.
Countries, hospitals and UTIs should therefore prepare for a sustained community transmission scenario of SARS-CoV-2 and for an increase in the number of COVID-19 patients who will need medical care, mainly intensive care, as is the case in the affected regions of Italy.
As highlighted in the ECDC's Rapid Risk Assessment, a fast, proactive and comprehensive approach is essential to delay the spread of SARS-CoV-2, with a shift from a containment approach to a mitigation approach, as the expected rapid increase in the number of cases may not provide sufficient time for decision-makers and hospitals to understand, accept and adapt their actions appropriately if not implemented in advance.
The rapid risk assessment also lists public health measures to mitigate the impact of the epidemic.
There is a small window of opportunity during which countries have the possibility to step up their control initiatives to slow the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and reduce pressure on the health system.
If these initiatives fail, health systems in other EU/EEA countries are likely to have an outbreak of patients who will need intensive care in the coming days or weeks.
The 2019 coronavirus disease epidemic (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus disease 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has killed more than 3,000 people and infected more than 80,000 in China and the rest of the world, resulting in a catastrophe for the population.
Similar to its homologous virus, SARS-CoV, which caused SARS in thousands of people in 2003, SARS-CoV-2 could also be transmitted from bats and causes similar symptoms through a similar mechanism.
However, COVID-19 has lower severity and mortality than SARS, but it is much more transmissible, and affects older people more than young people, and more men than women.
In response to the rapid increase in the number of publications on the new disease, this article seeks to provide a current and comprehensive assessment of the research object, which is developing rapidly.
We will deal with the basic principles of epidemiology, etiology, virology, diagnosis, treatment, prognosis and prevention of disease.
While many questions still need answers, we hope that this study will help us to understand and eradicate this hostile disease.
The Spring Festival on January 25, 2020 became a unique and unforgettable memory for all Chinese who were forced to remain confined for the entire holiday and for several weeks thereafter due to the epidemic of a new viral disease.
The virus has a strong resemblance to the coronavirus (CoV) which caused an outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003; therefore, it was designated SARS-CoV-2 by the World Health Organization (WHO) on 11 February 2020, and the respective disease was designated as COVID-19 disease (COVID-19).
The epidemic began in Wuhan, China, and spread rapidly across the country and to nearly 50 other countries around the world.
As of March 2, 2020, the virus had resulted in more than 80,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19, with more than 40,000 patients recovering and more than 3,000 patients dying.
WHO warns that COVID-19 is the "public enemy number one", and is potentially more powerful than terrorism.
According to PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/), in less than two months, more than 200 articles have been published on COVID-19, including its virology, epidemiology, etiology, diagnosis and treatment, since the first report on January 7, 2020, which determined the sequencing of the isolated virus from several patients.
This article seeks to summarize the progress of research in this new area of rapid development.
Where relevant, we will compare COVID-19 to SARS and the other disease caused by COVID, the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS, an epidemic in 2012).
We will also discuss what we have learned so far about disease prevention and prognosis, as well as other pressing issues.
CoVs are traditionally considered non-lethal pathogens to humans, primarily causing about 15% of common colds.
However, in this century, we've seen twice as many highly pathogenic human viruses, which are SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, causing an epidemic that originated in China in 2003 and Saudi Arabia in 2012, respectively, and that soon spread to several other countries with frightening morbidity and mortality.
So, the current COVID-19 is the third COVID epidemic in documented human history.
As shown in Fig. Fig.1,1, a portion of pneumonia cases with unknown origins were initially reported in Wuhan on 31 December 2019 to the National Health Commission of China.
Seven days later, the sequencing of the VC was published.
On 15 January 2020, the first fatal case of Wuhan was reported.
Meanwhile, the epidemic spread rapidly to neighboring cities, provinces, and countries.
On January 20, the infection of healthcare professionals was reported, suggesting that transmission between people was possible.
On January 23, the city of Wuhan was shut down, with all public transport interrupted.
On 24 January, the first clinical study on the disease reported that out of 41 patients with confirmed cases only 21 had direct contact with the Wuhan seafood market, which was considered the place of origin of the infection by an unknown animal source.
On January 30, the WHO declared the epidemic a global health emergency.
As of this report, the disease has spread to China and almost 50 other countries worldwide (Fig. (Fig. 2).2).
As the situation worsens rapidly, the extent and final severity of the epidemic still need to be determined.
On 11 February 2020, a multi-centre study of 8,866 patients, including 4,021 confirmed COVID-19 patients, provided a more up-to-date illustration of the epidemic, as follows (https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/UlBi-HX_rHPXa1qHA2bhdA).
SARS-CoV-2 has infected people of all ages, mainly in the age group of 30 to 65.
Nearly half (47.7%) of those infected were over 50, some were under 20, and only 14 infected were under 10.
SARS-CoV-2 has infected more men (0.31/100,000) than women (0.27/100,000).
COVID-19 has spread in groups, mainly in Hubei and its surroundings.
COVID-19 received an average of 5 (2 to 9) days for diagnosis based on the onset of symptoms.
The average incubation period was 4.8 (3.0 to 7.2) days.
The mean time of death based on the onset of symptoms was 9.5 (4.8 to 13) days.
The basic reproduction number (R0) was 3.77 (95% CI: 3.51 to 4.05), and the adjusted R0 was 2.23 to 4.82.
The number of infected people increased exponentially before 23 January 2020, corresponding to the mass transit time before the Spring Festival in China.
The mortality of patients with confirmed cases was 1.44% (95% CI: 1.10% to 1.86%), and the adjusted mortality of all patients was 3.06% (95% CI: 2.02% to 4.59%).
The three main risk factors for COVID-19 are gender (male), age (over 60 years) and severe pneumonia.
CoVs are a subfamily of large, encapsulated viruses that contain a unique chain of RNA with a certain meaning.
They can be divided into four genera, namely alpha, beta, gamma and delta, of which alpha and beta coronaviruses are known to infect humans.
The envelope spike (S) glycoprotein binds to its cellular receptors from angiotensin 2 (ECA2) and dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) converting enzyme for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, respectively and subsequently membrane fusion occurs.
The viral RNA genome is released into the cytoplasm; after replication of the viral genome, the genomic RNA accompanied by encapsulated glycoproteins and nucleocapsid proteins forms vesicles containing viruses, which bind to the plasma membrane and release the virus.
The first SARS-CoV-2 genome sequence was reported on 10 January 2020.
SARS-CoV-2 was found to be a new type of betacoronavirus with over 99.98% genetic identity among 10 sequentially sampled samples collected from the same original outbreak site, the Huanan Seafood Market in Wuhan.
SARS-CoV-2 is genetically more similar to SARS-CoV than MERS-CoV.
Through the transmission electron microscope, SARS-CoV-2 particles were discovered in ultrafine sections of the human airway epithelium.
Human ECA2 has been found to be a receptor for SARS-CoV-2, as well as SARS-CoV.
However, the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 binds to human protein ECA2 more weakly than the SARS-CoV protein, which coincides with the fact that SARS-CoV-2 causes less severe infection in patients than SARS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 can also form a new short protein encoded by orf3b and a secreted protein encoded by orf8.
SARS-CoV-2 orf3b may play a role in viral pathogenicity and inhibit expression of IFNβ; however, orf8 contains no known domain or functional motif.
On 18 February 2020 Zhou, et al., reported the total length human ECA2 cryo-EM structure at a resolution of 2,9 Å in a complex with the amino acid transporter B0AT1.
It was found that the complex, which had open and closed conformations, was grouped as a dimer, and the ECA2-B0AT1 complex can bind two S proteins, which provides evidence for recognition and infection by COVID-19.
B0AT1 may become a therapeutic target for drug screening to suppress SARS-CoV-2 infection.
The host of origin and the intermediary
Both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV are known to have originated from bats and have been transmitted to humans through civets and camels, respectively.
Through a phylogenetic comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with other CoVs, bats were considered the native hosts of SARS-CoV-2, as the new virus is 96% identical to two SARS-like bat-like CoVs designated bat-SL-CoVZX45 and bat-SL-CoVZX21.
However, the intermediate host that helped the virus cross species barriers and infect humans remains unknown, and the route of transmission still needs to be discovered.
Ji, et al., suggests that snakes carry the bat virus to humans, which involved a homologous recombination in the S protein.
According to one study, researchers in Guangzhou, China, suggested that pangolins, long-nosed mammals that feed on ants and are frequently used in traditional Chinese medicine, are the potential intermediate hosts of SARS-CoV-2, based on the 99% genetic homology between a COVID discovered in pangolins and SARS-CoV-2.
However, a difference of 1% in two genomes is a big difference; therefore, conclusive results for concrete tests are awaited (Fig. (Fig.33).
The physicochemical properties of SARS-CoV-2 are, for the most part, still unknown.
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV can survive in vitro for 48 hours in dry environments and up to 5 days below 20 °C with a humidity of 40% to 50%.
SARS-CoV-2 may have similar properties.
SARS-CoV-2 has been reported to be sensitive to ultraviolet rays and 56 °C heat for 30 minutes; ether, 75% ethanol, chlorine disinfectant, peracetic acid, chloroform and other organic solvents, but not chlorhexidine, are effective in deactivating the virus.
In general, the entire human population does not have immunity to SARS-CoV-2 and is therefore susceptible to the new virus.
Currently, no detailed studies have been reported regarding the immune response to SARS-CoV-2.
Therefore, we can only consult previous studies on other CoVs, mainly on SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Fig. (Fig.4).
Generally, after a virus has invaded the host, it is first recognized by the host's innate immune system through pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), including type C lectin receptors, Toll-type receptor (TLR), NOD-type receptor (NLR) and RIG-I-type receptor (RLR).
By different routes, the virus induces the expression of inflammatory factors, the maturation of dendritic cells and the synthesis of type I interferons (IFNs), which limit the spread of the virus and accelerate the phagocytosis of viral macrophages.
However, the N protein of SARS-CoV can help the virus escape immune responses.
In a short time, the adaptive immune response joins the fight against the virus.
T lymphocytes, including CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, play an important role in defense.
CD4+ T cells stimulate B cells to produce virus-specific antibodies, and CD8+ T cells directly kill virus-infected cells.
Collaborative T cells produce pro-inflammatory cytokines to help defend the cells.
However, CoV can inhibit T cell functions by inducing T cell apoptosis.
Humoral immunity, including supplements such as C3a and C5a antibodies, is also essential for fighting viral infection.
For example, isolated antibodies from a recovered patient neutralized MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, an exacerbated immune system reaction generates a large number of local free radicals that can cause serious damage to the lungs and other organs and, in the worst case, multiple organ failure, and even death.
SARS-CoV-2 infection, characterized by the onset of symptoms in a group of people, affects older people with comorbidities and pregnant women more.
It is common for people exposed to a large number of viruses or whose immune system is compromised to have a higher chance of being infected than other people.
The estimated average incubation period of SARS-CoV-2 is 1 to 14 days and most often 3 to 7 days, based on a study of the first 425 cases in Wuhan.
However, a study of 1,099 cases shows that the incubation period was on average 3 days and ranged from 0 to 24 days.
A more recent study, as described above, shows that the incubation period was 4.8 (3.0 to 7.2) days, based on the demographics of 8,866 cases.
It is essential that health authorities adjust the effective quarantine time based on the most accurate incubation period, thus preventing infected persons who do not show symptoms from transmitting the virus to others.
As a common practice, individuals exposed to the virus or infected with it usually need to be quarantined for 14 days.
Should the quarantine period be extended for 24 days?
Fever is usually the initial and main symptom of COVID-19, which can come alone or accompanied by other symptoms, such as dry cough, shortness of breath, muscle pain, dizziness, headache, sore throat, cough, chest pain, diarrhea, nausea and vomiting.
Some patients experienced dyspnea and/ or hypoxia a week after the onset of symptoms.
In severe cases, patients quickly developed into acute respiratory syndrome, septic shock, metabolic acidosis and coagulopathy.
Patients with fever and/ or respiratory symptoms and acute fever, even without abnormalities in the lung imaging diagnosis, should undergo virus screening in order to receive an early diagnosis.
A demographic study in late December 2019 showed that the percentages of symptoms were 98% for fever, 76% for dry cough, 55% for dyspnea, and 3% for diarrhea; 8% of patients needed ventilation support.
Similar results were reported in two recent studies of a family group and a group with transmission from an asymptomatic individual.
In comparison, a 2012 demographic study showed that MERS-CoV patients also had fever (98%), dry cough (47%) and dyspnea (55%) as primary symptoms.
However, 80% of patients needed ventilation support, far more than COVID-19 patients, which is the highest mortality from MERS compared to COVID-19.
Diarrhoea (26%) and sore throat (21%) were also observed in MERS patients.
In SARS patients, fever (99% to 100%), dry cough (29% to 75%), dyspnea (40% to 42%), diarrhea (20% to 25%) and sore throat (13% to 25%) were shown to be the main symptoms, and ventilation support was required for approximately 14% to 20% of patients.
As of February 14, COVID-19 mortality was 2%, when the confirmed cases worldwide reached 66,576.
In comparison, the mortality rate from SARS up to November 2002 was 10% of the 8,096 confirmed cases.
For MERS, based on a June 2012 demographic study, mortality was 37% of the 2,494 confirmed cases.
A more recent study reported that the baseline reproduction number R0 of SARS-CoV-2 was up to 6.47 with a 95% confidence interval (IC) of 5.71 to 7.23, while the R0 of SARS-CoV varied from 2 to 4 only.
A comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV with respect to its symptoms, mortality and R0 is presented in Table 1.1.
The above figures suggest that SARS-CoV-2 has a greater spread capacity than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, but is less lethal than the latter two.
So it's a much bigger challenge to control the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV.
Symptoms in a group of people usually occur in the same family or in the same group or vehicle, such as a cruise ship.
Patients generally have a history of travel or residence in Wuhan or other affected areas, or contact with infected individuals or patients in the two weeks prior to the onset of symptoms.
However, it has been reported that people can carry the virus for more than two weeks without showing symptoms, and cured patients who have been discharged from hospitals can contract the virus again, which generates an alarm for prolonged quarantine time.
Patients have a normal or reduced number of peripheral white blood cells (mainly lymphocytes) at the initial stage.
For example, lymphopenia with white blood cell counts below 4 x 109/L including lymphocyte counts below 1 x 109/L, and elevated levels of aspartate aminotransferase and viremia were detected in 1,099 patients with COVID-19.
Enzymes and myoglobin levels in the muscles and liver were increased in the blood of some patients, and C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation were increased in the blood of most patients.
In patients with severe cases, the level of dimer-D, a blood-derived fibrin degradation product, was elevated and lymphocyte count was progressively reduced.
Abnormalities in chest X-rays are present in most COVID-19 patients and present bilateral irregular shadows or opacity in dark glass in the lungs.
Patients generally developed atypical pneumonia, acute lung damage and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ADRS).
When SDRA occurs, uncontrolled inflammation, fluid buildup and progressive fibrosis severely impair gas exchange.
Type I and type II pneumocytes dysfunction decreases the surfactant level and increases surface tension, thus reducing the capacity of the lungs to expand and increasing the risk of lung collapse.
Therefore, the most severe chest x-ray results usually correspond to the most severe form of the disease.
On 18 February 2020, the first pathological analysis of COVID-19 demonstrated pneumatic clearance, hyaline membrane formation, infiltration of interstitial lymphocytes and sincytic cells into the lungs of a patient who died from the disease, consistent with the pathology of viral infection and SDRA, and similar to the pathology of patients with SARS and MERS.
Detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA by reverse polymerase  transcriptase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used as the main criterion for the diagnosis of COVID-19.
However, due to the high rate of false negatives, which may accelerate the epidemic, clinical manifestations began to be used for diagnosis (which became not derived from RT-PCR only) in China on 13 February 2020.
A similar situation has also occurred with the diagnosis of SARS.
Therefore, a combination of disease history, clinical manifestations, laboratory tests and radiological results is essential and indispensable to an effective diagnosis.
On 14 February 2020, the Feng Zhang group described a protocol for using the CRISPR-based SHERLOCK technique to detect SARS-CoV-2, which detects synthetic RNA fragments of SARS-CoV-2 at 20 x 10-18 mol/L to 200 x 10-18 mol/L (10 to 100 copies per input microlitre) using a measuring rod in less than an hour, without the need for complex instrumentation.
We hope that the new technique can dramatically increase sensitivity and convenience if tested in clinical samples.
Due to the lack of experience with the new COVID-19, doctors can provide, to the best of their ability, palliative treatment for COVID-19 patients while trying a variety of therapies that have been used or proposed previously for the treatment of other COVIDs such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV and other viral diseases (Table (Table2).2).
These therapies include current and potential treatments with antiviral drugs, immunosuppressants, steroids, cured patient plasma, Chinese medicine and psychological support.
Even plasma from patients who recovered has been suggested as a treatment.
Pharmaceutical companies are running against time to develop antibodies and vaccines against the virus.
SARS-CoV-2 primarily attacks the lungs at the beginning and probably also attacks, to a lesser degree, other organs with ECA2 expression, such as the gastrointestinal system and kidneys.
However, respiratory dysfunction and organ failure are the main threats to patients and the leading causes of death.
Therefore, respiratory support is essential to alleviate symptoms and save lives, and includes general oxygenation therapy, high-flow oxygenation, non-invasive ventilation and invasive mechanical ventilation depending on the severity of the disease.
Patients with severe respiratory symptoms need extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), a modified alternative cardiopulmonary technique used to treat severe heart or respiratory failure.
In addition, maintaining electrolyte balance, preventing and treating secondary infections and septic shock, and protecting vital organ functions are also essential for SARS-CoV-2 patients.
Cytokine cascade is known to result from an exacerbated immune system response in patients with SARS and MERS.
Cytokine cascade is a form of systemic inflammatory response characterized by the release of a number of cytokines including TNFα, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6, IFNα, IFNβ, IFNγ, and MCP-1.
These cytokines cause immune system cells to release a large number of free radicals, which are the main cause of SDRA and multiple organ failure.
Immunosuppression is essential in the treatment of cytokine cascades, especially in severe patients.
Corticosteroids and tocilizumab, a monoclonal anti-IL6 antibody, are being used to treat cytokine cascade.
Other immunosuppression treatments for cytokine cascade include modulation of the targeted immune response to T cells; blocking of IFN-y, IL-1 and TNF; inhibition of JAKs, blinatumomab; cytokine signaling suppressor 4; and HDAC inhibitors.
Steroids, such as immunosuppressants, have been widely used in the treatment of SARS to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage.
However, high-dose steroids were not beneficial for severe lung injury in patients with SARS and COVID-19.
They can cause serious side effects, especially avascular osteonecrosis, which drastically affects the prognosis.
However, short periods of low to moderate doses of corticosteroid treatment have been recommended for cautious use in seriously ill COVID-19 patients.
At the time of writing, no effective antiviral therapy has been confirmed.
However, intravenous administration with remdesivir, a nucleotide analogue, was found to be effective in an American patient with COVID-19.
Remdesivir is a new antiviral drug developed by Gilead, initially intended to treat diseases caused by Ebola and Marburg viruses.
Subsequently, remdesivir also demonstrated a possible inhibition of other simple-tape RNA viruses, including MERS and SARS viruses.
Based on this, Gilead supplied the compound to China to conduct some testing on individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2, and the results are long awaited.
In addition, baricitinib, interferon-α, lopinavir/ ritonavir, and ribavirin have been suggested as potential therapies for patients with acute respiratory symptoms.
Diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, liver damage and other adverse reactions may occur after combination therapy with lopinavir/ritonavir.
The interaction of these treatments with other drugs used in patients should be closely monitored.
Plasma of cured patients and antibody generation
The collection of blood from patients who have been cured of a contagious disease to treat other patients suffering from the same disease, or to protect healthy individuals from contracting the disease, has a long history.
In fact, treated patients usually have relatively high levels of antibodies to the pathogen in their blood.
Antibodies are an immunoglobulin (lg) produced by B cells to fight pathogens and other foreign bodies, and they recognize unique molecules in pathogens and neutralize them directly.
Based on this, plasma was collected from the blood of a group of patients who had recovered from COVID-19, and injected into 10 patients in critical condition.
His symptoms improved within 24 hours, with reduced inflammation and viral loads, and improved oxygen saturation in his blood.
However, verification and clarification are necessary in order to propose the use of the method on a large scale before the development of specific therapies.
In addition, given the therapeutic effects, some plasma-related disadvantages should be carefully considered.
For example, antibodies can over-stimulate the immune response and cause cytokine release syndrome, which is a potentially fatal toxicity.
The concentration of antibodies in the blood is usually low, and the demand for plasma is high to treat patients in serious condition.
It is difficult to develop and produce specific antibodies quickly enough to fight a global epidemic.
Therefore, it is more important and practical to isolate B cells from cured patients and identify the genetic codes that encode effective antibodies or to screen for effective antibodies against essential proteins of the virus.
That way, we can quickly increase the production of antibodies.
Traditional Chinese Medicine, or TCM, has been used for thousands of years to treat a variety of diseases in China.
However, its effects depend enormously on a combination of multiple components in a formula that varies depending on the diagnosis of a disease based on the theories of TCM.
Most effective components remain unknown or vague, as it is difficult to extract and verify these components or their optimal combinations.
Currently, due to the lack of specific and effective therapies for COVID-19, TCM has become one of the main alternative treatments for patients with mild or moderate symptoms, or for patients who have recovered from severe stages of the disease.
For example, Shu Feng Jie Du and Lian Hua Qing Wen capsules have been found to be effective in treating COVID-19.
The best cure rates for COVID-19 patients were observed in several provinces in China that used TCM in 87% of patients, including Gansu (63.7%), Ningxia (50%) and Hunan (50%), while Hubei Province, which used TCM in only about 30% of COVID-19 patients, achieved the lowest cure rate (13%).
However, this is a difficult comparison, since many impact factors, such as the number of patients and the severity of the disease, must be included in the assessment.
On 18 February 2020, Boli Zhang and colleagues published a comparative study between exclusive treatment with Western medicine and combined treatment with Western medicine with TCM.
It was found that the time required for recovery from body temperature, for the disappearance of symptoms and for hospitalization was considerably shorter in the Western medicine and TCM treated group than only in the Western medicine treated group.
The rate of worsening of symptoms (from mild to severe) was considerably lower for the group treated by Western medicine and CTM than for the group treated by Western medicine alone (7.4% versus 46.2%), and mortality was lower in the group treated by Western medicine and CTM than in the group treated by Western medicine alone (8.8% versus 39%).
However, the effectiveness and safety of the TCM still awaits further properly controlled testing at larger scales and at more centres.
It would also be useful to characterize the mechanisms of action and explain the effective components of TCM treatments or combinations thereof, if possible.
Patients confirmed with COVID-19 or suspected of the disease generally feel great fear of the highly contagious and potentially fatal disease, and quarantined people also feel bored, lonely and angry.
In addition, symptoms of infection, such as fever, hypoxia, and cough, as well as adverse treatment effects, such as corticosteroid insomnia, can increase anxiety and psychological distress.
In the early phase of the SARS epidemic, several psychiatric illnesses including persistent depression, anxiety, panic attacks, psychomotor arousal, symptoms of psychosis, delusion and even suicidal tendencies have been reported.
Contact tracking and mandatory quarantine as part of the public health system's actions against the COVID-19 epidemic can make people more anxious, and they can feel guilty about the effects of contagion, quarantine, and stigma imposed on their families and friends.
Therefore, mental health care should be provided to COVID-19 patients, to people suspected of the disease and to people who have had contact with them, as well as to the general population, who need it.
Psychological support should include the establishment of multidisciplinary mental health teams, clear communication with regular and accurate updates on the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic and treatment plans, and the use of professional electronic devices and applications to avoid direct contact between people.
Effective vaccines are essential to disrupt the chain of transmission from animal reservoirs and infected people to susceptible hosts, and are generally complementary to antiviral treatment in the control of epidemics caused by emerging viruses.
Initiatives have been taken to develop S-protein-based vaccines to generate potent and long-lasting neutralizing antibodies and/or protective immunity against SARS-CoV.
Vaccines have been evaluated in animal models for SARS.
However, the in vivo efficacy of these vaccine candidates in older individuals and the lethal challenge models and their protection against zoonotic virus infection still need to be determined before a clinical trial can begin.
This is probably because SARS disappeared 17 years ago and no new cases have been reported since.
On the other hand, sporadic cases and outbreaks of MERS continue to occur in the Middle East and spread to other regions due to the persistence of zoonotic sources in endemic areas.
Vaccination strategies have been developed for MERS using inactive viruses, DNA plasmids, viral vectors, nanoparticles, virus-like particles and recombinant protein subunits, and some have been evaluated in animal models.
The development of a safe and effective vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 for non-immune individuals is an urgent and essential task for the control of the current epidemic.
However, it is a challenge to overcome the difficulty, due to the long time (18 months, on average) needed to develop a vaccine and the variations in the dynamics of the VOCs.
As a new disease, COVID-19 has just begun to manifest its full clinical evolution, reaching thousands of patients.
In most cases, patients recover gradually without any consequences.
However, just like SARS and MERS, COVID-19 is also associated with high morbidity and mortality in patients with severe cases.
Building a disease forecast model is therefore essential for health agencies to prioritize their services, especially in resource-poor areas.
Based on clinical studies reported so far, the following factors may affect or be associated with the prognosis of patients with COVID-19 (Table (Table33):
Age: Age was the most important factor in the prognosis of SARS, which also applies to COVID-19.
COVID-19 mainly affects people aged 30 to 65, with 47.7% of patients aged over 50, in a study of 8,866 cases, as described above.
Patients who needed intensive care were more likely to experience underlying comorbidities and complications, and were significantly older than patients who did not need intensive care (average age 66 years versus 51 years), suggesting that age is a prognostic factor for the health outcome of COVID-19 patients.
Gender: SARS-CoV-2 has infected more men than women (0.31/100,000 men and 0.27/100,000 women), as described above.
Comorbidities and complications: patients with COVID-19 who need intensive care are more likely to suffer acute heart injury or arrhythmia.
Heart attacks were the leading cause of death in patients with SARS.
It has been reported that SARS-CoV-2 may also bind to ECA2 positive colangiocytes, which may lead to liver dysfunction in patients with COVID-19.
It is important to note that age and underlying diseases are strongly correlated and can interfere with each other.
Abnormal laboratory results: blood C-reactive protein (CRP) level reflects the severity of inflammation or tissue injury and has been proposed as a potential prognostic factor for disease, response to therapy and final recovery.
The correlation of CRP level with severity and prognosis of COVID-19 was also proposed.
In addition, high lactate hydrogenase (LDH), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and creatine kinase (CK) may also assist in predicting the outcome.
These enzymes are expressed in various organs, mainly the heart and liver, and are released during tissue damage.
So they're traditional markers for heart or liver dysfunction.
Key clinical symptoms: chest x-ray and temporal progression of clinical symptoms should be considered in conjunction with other issues for predicting outcomes/compliances of COVID-19.
Steroid use: as described above, steroids are immunosuppressants commonly used as adjunct therapy for infectious diseases to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage.
In view of the widespread use of high doses of corticosteroids in patients with severe SARS, many survivors suffered from avascular osteonecrosis, permanent disability and low quality of life.
Therefore, if necessary, steroids should be used in low doses and for a short period in patients with COVID-19.
Psychological stress: As described above, during the COVID-19 epidemic, many patients suffer from high stress as they go through long quarantine periods and uncertainties, and witness the deaths of loved ones and other patients.
Providing psychological counseling and lasting support is essential to help these patients recover from stress and resume a normal life.
According to demographic studies so far, COVID-19 appears to have different epidemiological characteristics from SARS.
In addition to replicating in the lower respiratory tract, SARS-CoV-2 can replicate efficiently in the upper respiratory tract and does not cause symptoms in the early stages of infection (or causes only mild symptoms), similar to other common cold-causing CoVs.
Therefore, patients infected in the initial stage or in the incubation period can produce a large amount of the virus during their daily activities, causing a great difficulty in controlling the epidemic.
However, transmission of SARS-CoV has been considered to occur when patients are seriously ill, with most transmissions not occurring in the early stage.
So the current COVID-19 epidemic is much more severe and difficult to control than the SARS epidemic.
Major efforts are currently being made in China, including the confinement of Wuhan and nearby cities, and the continuing quarantine of almost the entire population, in the hope of halting the transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
Although these actions have drastically affected the economy and other sectors of the country, the number of new patients is declining, indicating the remission of the epidemic.
The most optimistic estimate is that the epidemic will end by March, and the slowdown phase will last between three and four months.
However, other experts are not so optimistic.
Paul Hunter, et al., estimated that COVID-19, which appears to be substantially more infectious than SARS, will not end in 2020.
Ira Longini, et al., established a model to predict the outcome of the epidemic and suggested that SARS-CoV-2 could infect two-thirds of the world's population.
A Canadian group reported that SARS-CoV-2 was detected in the throat and middle cornea swabs of patients who recovered and were discharged from hospital in the previous 2 weeks, indicating that the newly identified virus may become a flu-like cyclical episode.
However, promising evidence has emerged in China based on the decline in the number of new cases, indicating that current strategies could be working.
Ebola was originally predicted to cause up to a million cases, with half a million deaths.
However, with strict quarantine and isolation, the disease was finally kept under control.
It is possible that SARS-CoV-2, like SARS-CoV, may become weaker in terms of its infectiousness and, at some point, become a less pathogenic virus coexisting with humans.
A comparison of the COVID-19 epidemic with SARS and MERS is shown below (Fig. (Fig.55)).
SARS-CoV-2 is highly transmissible through coughing and sneezing and possibly through direct contact with materials contaminated with the virus.
The virus has also been found in feces, which creates a new possibility: oral-fecal transmission.
A recent study of 138 cases reported that 41% of cases were possibly caused by nosocomial infections, including 17 patients with underlying diseases and 40 healthcare professionals.
Therefore, greater precautions should be taken to protect people, especially healthcare professionals, social workers, family members, co-workers and people in direct contact with infected patients or individuals.
The first line of defence that can be used to reduce the risk of infection is the use of face masks; the use of surgical masks and N95 respiratory masks (series No. 1860s) helps to control the spread of the virus.
Surgical face masks prevent fluid droplets from a potentially infected individual from being carried through the air or adhering to the surfaces of objects where they can infect other people.
However, only N95 masks (series 1860s) protect against inhalation of viruses ranging in size from 10 nm to 80 nm, with only 5% of viruses being able to penetrate completely; SARS-CoV-2 is similar to SARS-CoV in size, and both are approximately 85 nm.
Since particles can penetrate up to five surgical masks together, healthcare professionals in direct contact with patients should wear N95 masks (series 1860s) but not surgical masks.
In addition to masks, healthcare professionals should wear insulation clothing to further reduce contact with the virus.
Viruses also infect an individual through the eyes.
On January 22, 2020, a doctor was infected with SARS-CoV-2, although he was wearing an N95 mask; the virus could have entered his body through his inflamed eyes.
Therefore, healthcare professionals should also wear transparent facial protectors or protective glasses when serving patients.
For the general public in affected or potentially affected areas, it is highly recommended that everyone wash their hands with disinfectant soap more often than normal, try to stay home in isolation and limit contact with potentially infected people.
A meter is considered an adequate distance to stay away from a patient.
These actions are effective methods to reduce the risk of infection as well as prevent the spread of the virus.
Although SARS-CoV-2 emerged as a new virus for humans, its high homology to SARS-CoV, as reported on 7 January 2020, should have caused a major alert for China, based on its recent history with the SARS epidemic in 2003.
However, it was not until January 19, 2020 that the director of the Wuhan Center for Disease Control reassured citizens, saying that the new virus has a low rate of infection and limited reproductivity among humans, and that it was not difficult to prevent and contain the disease.
This message left people more relaxed, especially as the whole country was preparing for the Spring Festival, and the critical period for the containment of the disease in Wuhan on a minimal scale was lost.
Disease control agencies in China can take advantage of this hard time and make crucial improvements in the future.
For example, these agencies should: (1) be more cautious in making public statements, as everything they say is absorbed by citizens and can influence their attitudes and decisions; (2) be more sensitive and responsive to unusual information from hospitals, rather than waiting for formal communications from doctors and authorities; (3) be more restrictive in containing a potential early-stage epidemic, rather than trying to comfort the public; and (4) more frequently issue targeted and effective simulations to raise public awareness of epidemic diseases and periodically test and improve society's response system.
The COVID-19 epidemic caused by the new SARS-CoV-2 virus began in late December 2019.
In less than two months, it had spread throughout China and to nearly 50 other countries around the world at the time this text was written.
Since the virus is very similar to SARS-CoV, and the symptoms are also similar between COVID-19 and SARS, the COVID-19 epidemic has generated a sense of SARS returning.
However, there are significant differences between COVID-19 and SARS, which are essential for epidemic containment and patient treatment.
COVID-19 affects older people more than young people, and more men than women, and the severity and mortality rate are also higher in older people than in young people.
SARS has a higher mortality rate than COVID-19 (10.91% versus 1.44%).
Patients with COVID-19 transmit the virus when they do not show symptoms, while patients with SARS usually transmit it when they are seriously ill, which causes greater difficulty in containing the spread of COVID-19 than SARS.
This explains, in part, why SARS-CoV-2 spreads much faster and affects more regions than SARS-CoV.
Regular RNA testing for SARS-CoV-2 may be negative in some patients with COVID-19.
On the other hand, cured patients may get tested positive for the virus again.
These results dramatically increase the risk of the virus spreading.
Given the rapid progress in research on COVID-19, several crucial issues still need to be resolved, as follows:
Where did SARS-CoV-2 come from?
Although a 96% genetic homologue has been found between SARS-CoV-2 and two SARS-like bat-like CoVs, we cannot yet conclude that SARS-CoV-2 originated in bats.
Which animal was the intermediate species that transmitted the virus from the original host, the bat, say, to humans?
Without knowing the answers to questions 1 and 2, we cannot effectively cut off the transmission and the epidemic could recur at any time.
Although molecular modeling and biochemical trials have shown that SARS-CoV-2 binds to ECA2, how exactly does the virus enter the respiratory tract cells and cause subsequent pathological changes?
Does the virus also bind to cells that express ECA2 in other organs?
Without clear answers to these questions, we cannot get a quick and accurate diagnosis and effective treatment.
How long will the epidemic last?
How is the virus evolving genetically during transmission between humans?
Will it become a global pandemic, disappear like SARS or have a seasonal recurrence like the flu?
It is essential, but it may take some time to search for answers to the above questions and many others.
However, regardless of the efforts required, we have no choice but to stop the epidemic as soon as possible and return to our normal lives.
Zoonotic origins of human coronavirus
Mutation and adaptation have driven the coevolution of coronavirus (CoVs) and their hosts, including humans, for thousands of years.
Prior to 2003, two human CoVs (HCoVs) were known to cause a mild illness, such as a common cold.
The outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) have changed how people thought about CoVs and revealed how lethal and devastating an HCoV infection can be.
The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in central China in late 2019 has brought the COVID-19 back into the spotlight and surprised everyone with its high transmissibility and reduced pathogenicity compared to its sibling SARS-CoV.
HCoV infection is zoonotic, and understanding the zoonotic origins of HCoVs is of great help.
Most HCoVs originated in bats, in which they are nonpathogenic.
The intermediate reservoir hosts of some HCoVs are also known.
The identification of animal hosts has direct implications for disease prevention in humans.
Investigation of the interactions of the host of the VC in animals can also provide important information on the pathogenesis of the VC in humans.
In this study, we present an overview of the information available on the seven HCoVs, with a focus on the history of their discovery as well as their zoonotic origins and interspecies transmission.
One important analysis is what we do of comparing and contrasting different HCoVs from a perspective of virus evolution and genome recombination.
The current outbreak of COVID-19 disease 2019 (COVID-19) is discussed in this context.
In addition, the requirements for effective transition between hosts and the implications of the evolution of the virus on the severity of the disease are also highlighted.
Coronaviruses (CoVs) belong to the family Coronaviridae, which comprises a group of encapsulated, positive polarity and simple-tape RNA viruses.
These viruses that have the largest genome, between 26 and 32 kilobases, among RNA viruses have been termed "CoVs" due to their crown morphology when observed under an electronic microscope.
As for structure, VOCs have unsegmented genomes that share a similar organization.
Approximately two thirds of the genome contain two overlapping open reading structures (ORF1a and ORF1b), which are translated into the pp1a and pp1ab replicase polyproteins.
The polyproteins are re-transformed and generate 16 non-structural proteins, designated nsp1 to nsp16.
The remaining portion of the genome contains ORFs for structural proteins, including spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M) and nucleoproteins (N).
Some ancillary proteins of specific lineage are also encoded by different CoV lineages.
Based on the difference in protein sequences, CoVs are classified into four genera (alphaCoV, betaCoV, gammaCoV, and deltaCoV), among which the betaCoV genus contains most HCoVs and is subdivided into four lineages (A, B, C, and D).
Phylogenetic evidence has shown that bats and rodents serve as the genetic source for most alphaCoVs and betaCoVs, while birds are the main reservoir of gammaCoVs and deltaCoVs.
For thousands of years, CoVs have consistently crossed species barriers, and some have become relevant human pathogens.
So far, seven human co-vests (HCoVs) are known.
Among them, HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63 are alphaCoVs.
The other five betaCoVs include HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV), and SARS-CoV-2.
HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63 viruses generally cause mild symptoms such as a common cold and/or diarrhea.
In contrast, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and the newly identified SARS-CoV-2 are highly pathogenic and cause severe lower respiratory tract infection in a relatively large number of patients, with a high chance of developing acute respiratory distress syndrome (ASDR) and extrapulmonary manifestations.
The first strain of HCoV-229E, B814, was isolated from the cluster of common cold patients in the mid-1960s.
Since then, more knowledge has been accumulated through comprehensive studies on HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, both of which cause self-limiting symptoms.
In fact, the concept that HCoV infection is generally harmless was widely accepted until the SARS epidemic.
The SARS epidemic that occurred in 2003 is one of the most devastating in recent times, infecting more than 8,000 people, with a confirmed case-related gross mortality rate of approximately 10%.
Ten years later, the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) epidemic resulted in a persistent epidemic in the Arabian Peninsula, with sporadic spread to the rest of the world.
The new 2019 (2019-nCoV) HCoV, which was later renamed SARS-CoV-2, is the causative agent of the current 2019 coronavirus disease epidemic (COVID-19), which has claimed more than 3,120 lives and infected more than 91,000 people as of March 3, 2020.
The alarm is sounding, and the world needs to prepare for the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic that is coming.
All seven HCoVs have zoonotic origin in bats, mice or domestic animals.
Multiple lines of evidence corroborate the evolutionary origin of all HCoVs from bats, where viruses are well adapted and non-pathogenic but demonstrate great genetic diversity.
The COVID-19 epidemic presents enormous medical, scientific, social and moral challenges for China and the rest of the world.
Tracing the zoonotic origins of HCoVs provides a framework for understanding the natural history, driving force and restrictive factors of virus migration to other species.
This may also guide and facilitate the search for hosts for the reservoir, intermediate and amplifier of SARS-CoV-2, with important implications for future prevention of viral migration between species.
In this article, we present an overview of the zoonotic origins, interspecies transmission and pathogenesis of HCoVs.
In particular, we highlighted and discussed the common theme that the parent viruses of HCoVs are generally nonpathogenic in their natural reservoir hosts, but become pathogenic after interspecies transmission to a new host.
We also reviewed the evolutionary trend of HCoV, where increased transmissibility is usually accompanied by decreased pathogenicity.
The outcome of the current SARS-CoV-2 epidemic is also discussed in this context.
Animal VOCs have been known since the late 1930s.
Prior to the first isolation of the B814 strain of HCoV-229E from the cranes of patients who contracted the common cold, different CoVs had been isolated in several infected animals, including turkey, mouse, cow, pig, cat and dog.
In the last decades, seven HCoVs have been identified.
A brief summary of the history of the discovery of HCoV in chronological order (Table 1) would be informative and instructive.
The first strain of HCoV-229E was isolated from the respiratory tract of patients with upper respiratory tract infection in 1966, and was subsequently adapted for growth in WI-38 lung cell lineages.
Patients infected with HCoV-229E have experienced symptoms of common cold, including headache, sneezing, discomfort and sore throat, with fever and cough present in 10% to 20% of cases.
Subsequently, in 1967, HCoV-OC43 was isolated from organ culture and subsequent serial passage in the brains of lactating mice.
The clinical characteristics of HCoV-OC43 infection appear similar to those caused by HCoV-229E, which are symptomatically indistinguishable from infection by other respiratory tract pathogens, such as influenza A viruses and rhinoviruses.
HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 are globally distributed, and tend to be transmitted predominantly during the winter season in temperate climates.
In general, the incubation period of these two viruses is less than one week, followed by the disease for approximately 2 weeks.
According to a study with human volunteers, healthy individuals infected with HCoV-229E developed a common mild cold.
Only a few immunocompromised patients exhibited severe lower respiratory tract infection.
SARS, also known as "atypical pneumonia", was the first documented pandemic caused by HCoV in human history, and the etiological agent is SARS-CoV, the third HCoV discovered.
The first case of SARS dates back to 2002 in Guangdong Province, China.
The SARS epidemic resulted in 8,096 reported cases with 774 deaths, spreading across several countries and continents.
With the exception of the "super-spreaders", it has been estimated that each infected person can infect approximately two others, with an incubation period of 4 to 7 days, and with the peak of viral load occurring on the tenth day of the disease.
Patients infected with SARS-CoV initially experience myalgia, headache, fever, malaise and chills, followed by subsequent symptoms of dyspnea, cough and breathing discomfort.
Lymphopenia, hepatic dysfunction and elevated creatine kinase are common abnormalities of SARS in laboratory tests.
Diffuse alveolar damage, proliferation of epithelial cells and increased macrophage count have also been observed in SARS patients.
Approximately 20% to 30% of patients will need intensive care and mechanical ventilation at some point.
In addition to the lower respiratory tract, several organs, including the gastrointestinal tract, liver and kidneys, may also be affected in these severe cases, usually with the occurrence of a cytokine cascade, which can be fatal, especially in immunocompromised patients.
The virus was first isolated in a lung biopsy of a relative of the zero patient traveling from Guangzhou to Hong Kong.
Since then, enormous efforts have been devoted to research on HCoV.
HCoV-NL63 was isolated from a 7-month-old baby in the Netherlands in late 2004.
The virus was initially found to be prevalent in young children, the elderly, and immunocompromised patients with respiratory diseases.
Symptoms of colds, conjunctivitis, fever and bronchiolitis are common in the disease caused by HCoV-NL63.
Another independent study described isolating the same virus from a nasal specimen of an 8-month-old baby suffering from pneumonia in the Netherlands.
Although he was identified in the Netherlands, he's scattered around the world.
It has been estimated that HCoV-NL63 accounts for approximately 4.7% of common respiratory diseases, and its peak incidence occurs in winter, spring and early summer.
HCoV-NL63 is associated with obstructive laryngitis, also known as croup.
In the same year, HCoV-HKU1 was isolated from a 71-year-old man hospitalized with pneumonia and bronchiolitis in Hong Kong.
In addition to community-acquired pneumonia and bronchiolitis, HCoV-HKU1 was reported to be associated with exacerbation of acute asthma.
In the same way as HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 has been found worldwide, causing mild respiratory diseases.
All four of these community-acquired HCoVs have adapted well to humans and are generally less likely to mutate and cause highly pathogenic diseases, although accidents have occurred for unknown reasons in the rare case of a more virulent subtype of HCoV-NL63, which was recently reported as causing severe lower respiratory tract infection in China.
In general, when these HCoVs acquire the ability to be transmitted efficiently and to persist continuously in humans, they also become less virulent and less pathogenic.
MERS-CoV was first isolated in 2012 from the lung of a 60-year-old patient who developed acute pneumonia and kidney failure in Saudi Arabia.
While most laboratory-confirmed cases originate in the Middle East, cases imported with occasional secondary spread to close contacts have been reported in several European countries and Tunisia.
Another secondary epidemic occurred in South Korea in 2015 with 186 confirmed cases.
The clinical manifestations of MERS are similar to those of SARS, characterized by progressive acute pneumonia.
Unlike SARS, many patients with MERS also develop acute renal failure, which is therefore quite peculiar to MERS, among diseases caused by HCoV.
More than 30% of patients experience gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhea and vomiting.
As of 14 February 2020, more than 2,500 laboratory-confirmed cases have been reported with a high confirmed case-related mortality rate of 34.4%, making MERS-CoV one of the most devastating viruses known to man.
In the mid- to late-December 2019, groups of patients with pneumonia, which was known in retrospect to be associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection, were detected in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
The World Health Organization has declared the ongoing epidemic of lower respiratory tract infection caused by SARS-CoV-2 to be an International Public Health Emergency and has also named the disease COVID-19.
As of 3 March 2020, 90,053 cases have been confirmed worldwide, with a confirmed case-related gross mortality rate of 3.4%.
It is noted that the confirmed case fatality in Hubei, China, is 4,2%, while the fatality outside that city is 1,2%.
SARS-CoV-2 causes severe respiratory infection, as does SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, with fever, cough and dyspnea.
Some patients also have diarrhea.
Pneumonia is one of the most severe symptoms and can quickly develop into acute respiratory distress syndrome.
Although SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are very similar due to the high homology of 82% in the nucleotide sequence, they cluster in different branches in the phylogenetic tree.
SARS-CoV-2 is apparently less pathogenic but is more transmissible compared to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Asymptomatic individuals have been reported infected with SARS-CoV-2, and they may contribute to the rapid spread of the virus worldwide.
The comparison and contrast of SARS-CoV-2 with the other six HCoVs reveal similarities and differences of great relevance.
First, the incubation period and the duration of evolution of HCoV disease are very similar.
In this sense, SARS-CoV-2 follows the general trend of the other six HCoVs.
The Commission has also concluded that the severity of the symptoms of COVID-19 lies between the severity of SARS-CoV and the severity of the four community-acquired HCoVs (HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63).
On the one hand, SARS-CoV-2 infection has characteristics that are most observed during infection with community-acquired HCoVs, including the presence of non-specific, mild or even no symptoms.
On the other hand, a small subset of severe cases of COVID-19 can also be observed, as in the case of SARS-CoV infection, although the proportion is slightly lower.
Third, transmission of SARS-CoV-2 also shows interesting patterns in both community-acquired HCoVs and SARS-CoVs.
On the one hand, the transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 is at least as high as that of community-acquired HCoVs.
On the other hand, it should be confirmed whether the transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 decreases after passing to humans, as in the case of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Finally, just like other HCoVs, SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in fecal samples.
It is still necessary to clarify in future studies whether or not the fecal transmission of SARS-CoV-2 plays an important role, as in the case of SARS-CoV, at least in some circumstances.
It is also of great interest to find out whether SARS-CoV-2 can exhibit seasonality, as in community-acquired HCoVs.
In any case, the characteristics of SARS-CoV-2, including its transmissibility, pathogenicity and sustainable spread after its passage to humans, will influence the outcome of the current COVID-19 epidemic.
All community-acquired HCoVs that cause mild symptoms have adapted well to humans.
From another perspective, it may also be true that humans have adapted well to these four HCoVs.
In other words, both could be survivors of ancient HCoV pandemics.
HCoVs that cause serious disease in humans and people who develop serious HCoVs disease have been eliminated.
For this to happen, HCoVs need to replicate in humans to a sufficient extent to allow for the accumulation of adaptive mutations that neutralize the restriction factors.
In this sense, the longer the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic lasts, the more people will be infected, and the greater the chance that the virus will adapt to humans.
If adaptation is appropriate, its transmission to humans would be difficult to control with quarantine or other infection control measures.
For several years, the four community-acquired CoVs have been circulating in human populations, causing a common cold in immunocompetent individuals.
These viruses don't need an animal reservoir.
In contrast, highly pathogenic SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV have not adapted well to humans, and their transmission between humans cannot be sustained.
They need to stay and spread in their zoonotic reservoirs and take the chance to migrate to susceptible human targets, possibly through one or more intermediate hosts and amplifiers.
SARS-CoV-2 has similar characteristics to SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and the four community-acquired HCoVs.
It is highly transmissible, just like community-acquired HCoVs, at least so far.
However, it is more pathogenic than community-acquired HCoVs and less pathogenic than SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
It remains to be discovered whether it will fully adapt to human beings and circulate among us without a reservoir or intermediate animal host.
Before discussing the animal origins of HCoVs, it would be useful to discuss the definitions and characteristics of evolutionary, natural, reservoirs, intermediates and amplifiers of HCoVs.
An animal serves as the evolutionary host of an HCoV if it hosts a direct ancestor, sharing high homology at the nucleotide sequence level.
The ancestral virus is usually well adapted and nonpathogenic in that host.
In the same way, a reservoir host hosts HCoV continuously and permanently.
In both cases, hosts are naturally infected and are natural hosts of HCoV or its parent virus.
In contrast, if HCoV is newly introduced to an intermediate host just before or near its introduction to humans, it does not adapt appropriately to the new host, and is usually pathogenic.
This intermediate host can serve as the zoonotic source of human infection and perform the function of an amplifier host, allowing the virus to replicate transiently and then transmit it to humans and increasing the scale of human infection.
An HCoV may have the infection stopped if it cannot sustain its transmission in the intermediate host.
In contrast, HCoVs can also adapt to the intermediate host and establish long-term endemism.
In this case, the intermediate host becomes the natural reservoir host.
Epidemiological data revealed that the zero SARS patient had a history of contact with game animals.
Subsequent surveys of the prevalence indicated that animal traders had a higher prevalence of IgG antiSARS-CoV compared to the general population.
Masked palm doves (Paguma larvata) and a water dog in live animal markets were initially identified as carriers of SARS-CoV-like viruses.
The identification was indirectly corroborated by the fact that no other SARS was reported after all the civilians were slaughtered in the markets.
However, it has been reported that wild or farm-to-farm masked palm civets without exposure to live animal markets were highly negative for SARS-CoV, suggesting that masked palm civets could only be the amplifier intermediate host but not the natural reservoir for SARS-CoV.
It is noted that 80% of different animals in Guangzhou markets have antibodies to SARS-CoV; the possibility that several species of small mammals may serve as intermediate hosts amplifying SARS-CoV cannot be excluded.
All of these animals appear to be terminal hosts of SARS-CoV.
Subsequent search by the natural animal host of SARS-CoV revealed a closely related bat VC, named SARS-related bat HKU3 Rhinolophus (SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3), which exists in the Chinese bat-rod.
These bats are positive for antibodies to SARS-CoV and for the genomic sequence of SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3.
This and other bat CoVs share 88% to 92% homology to SARS-CoV in nucleotide sequence.
These studies formed the basis for the new concept that bats are the hosts of emerging human pathogens.
Several SARS-like CoVs (SL-CoVs) have also been identified in bats, but no CoV, except the designated WIV1, can be isolated as a living virus.
The human angiotensin 2 (ECA2) converting enzyme is known to be the receptor for SARS-CoV.
WIV1 derived from bat fecal samples has been shown to use ECA2 from bats, civets and humans as a receptor for cell entry.
It's intriguing that the serum of convalescing SARS patients was able to neutralize WIV1.
So far, WIV1 represents the closest ancestor to SARS-CoV in bats, sharing 95% homology in the nucleotide sequence.
Despite the high homology between these two viruses, it is generally believed that WIV1 is not the immediate parent virus of SARS-CoV, and that bats are not the immediate reservoir hosts of SARS-CoV.
The phylogenetic analysis groups MERS-CoV into the same group as the CoV-HKU4 in bats and that the CoV-HKU5 in bats.
Bat CoV-HKU4 and MERS-CoV use the same host receptor, dipeptidylpeptidase 4 (DPP4), for the entry of the virus.
RNA-dependent RNA polymerase sequences of MERS-CoV are phylogenetically closest to homologues in betaCoVs of bats identified in Europe and Africa.
So far, no live MERS-CoV has been found in wild bats.
MERS-CoV and its closest relative, the bat CoV-HKU25, share only 87% homology in nucleotide sequence.
Therefore, bats may not be the immediate reservoir host for MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, studies in the Middle East have shown that dromedaries are seropositive to specific MERS-CoV neutralizing antibodies, as are Middle Eastern camels in several African countries.
Living MERS-CoV, identical to the virus found in humans, has been isolated from dromedary nasal swabs, increasing evidence that camels serve as the legitimate reservoir host for MERS-CoV.
It is also worth noting that symptoms are generally mild but with massive transmission of the virus, have been observed in camels experimentally infected with MERS-CoV.
It is noteworthy that infected camels transmit the viruses not only through the respiratory tract but also through the fecal-oral route, which is also the main route of transmission of viruses to bats.
However, there is still a lack of response, as many confirmed cases of MERS do not have a history of contact with camels before symptoms occurred, which can be plausibly attributed to human-to-human transmission or to transmission routes involving unidentified animal species that host MERS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 shares 96.2% nucleotide homology with a bat RaTG13 CoV, isolated from Rhinolophus affinis bats.
As in the cases of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the sequence divergence between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is too large to attribute a parental relationship.
That is, bats may not be the immediate reservoir hosts of SARS-CoV-2 unless near-identical bats CoVs are discovered in the future.
It is assumed that intermediate animal hosts of SARS-CoV-2 should be set up among wild species sold and slaughtered at the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, to which many of the initial cases of COVID-19 have been associated, indicating a likely event of animal-to-human transmission.
Several recent studies based on metagenomic sequencing have suggested that a group of small endangered mammals known as pangolins (Manis javanica) could also harbor ancestral betaCoVs related to SARS-CoV-2.
These new pangolin VC genomes share 85% to 92% homology in nucleotide sequence with SARS-CoV-2.
However, they are also directly related to RaTG13 with about 90% nucleotide sequence identity.
They group into sub-linings of SARS-CoV-2-like viruses in the phylogenetic tree, one of which shares a receptor-binding domain (DLR) with SARS-CoV-2, with 97.4% identity in amino acid sequence.
In stark contrast, the DLRs of SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 are more divergent, although they exhibit a high degree of sequential homology across the genome.
A recent study on sick pangolins also reported detection of viral consensus sequences from lung samples, which are closely related to SARS-CoV-2.
This study adopted different methods of manual configuration and curation to generate a partial genomic sequence, corresponding to about 86.3% of the viral genome in total size.
We cannot rule out the possibility that pangolym is one of the intermediate animal hosts of SARS-CoV-2.
However, there is currently no evidence to confirm the direct origin of SARS-CoV-2 from pangolin due to the sequence divergence between SARS-CoV-2 and pangolin-related SARS-CoV-2 beta-CoVs.
In addition, the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is even shorter than the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and pangolin-related SARS-CoV-2 beta-CoVs.
The evolutionary route of SARS-CoV-2 in bats, pangolins and other mammals still needs to be clarified.
While the highest sequential homology was found in DLRs between SARS-CoV-2 and pangolym, the SARS-CoV-2-related betaCoVs, SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 share the highest broad genomic sequential homology.
It is highly speculative that the high degree of similarity between the DLRs of pangolin betaCoVs related to SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2 stems from convergent evolution mediated by selectivity.
A counterargument counts in favor of recombination between SARS-CoV-2-related pangolin betaCoV and RaTG13 in the third wild animal species.
As a driving force in evolution, recombination is quite present in betaCoVs.
The immediate zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2 remains under investigation.
In addition to highly pathogenic HCoVs, the zoonotic origin of HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1 viruses has also been studied.
Phylogenetic evidence has indicated that both HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E may have originated from bat CoVs, while the parent viruses of HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 have been discovered in rodents.
It was reported that a bat VC named ARCoV.2 (Appalachian Ridge VC) detected in the American tricolor bat had a direct relationship to HCoV-NL63.
On the other hand, HCoV-229E was genetically related to another bat COVID-19, called Hipposideros/GhanaKwam/19/2008, which was detected in Ghana, and camellids are also suspected to be its intermediate hosts.
For clarity, current knowledge on the known animal origins of HCoVs is summarized in Figure 1 and Table 2.
Phylogenetic analysis has provided evidence for interspecies transmission events of HCoVs throughout history.
When HCoV-OC43 crossed species and infected humans from domestic animals around 1890, a respiratory infection pandemic was recorded.
The interspecies transmission history of HCoV-229E is less clear.
Bat alpha-CoVs closely related to HCoV-229E have been discovered.
Among them, there's an alphaCoV from alpacas.
Several lines of evidence support the direct transmission of the bat virus to humans.
First, humans, but not alpacas, can have contact with bats in a shared ecological niche.
In contrast, humans have direct contact with alpacas.
Second, bat alphaCoVs related to HCoV-229E are diverse and non-pathogenic in bats, while alpaca alphaCoVs have caused an epidemic of respiratory disease in infected animals.
Finally, alpaca alphaCoV has not been found in wild animals.
Therefore, the possibility cannot be excluded that alpacas derive from humans the HCoV-229E-related alphaCoV.
In fact, bats are the direct source of pathogenic viruses for humans, including the rabies virus, Ebola virus, Nipah virus, and Hendra virus.
So it's not surprising that bats transmit HCoV-229E directly to humans.
Alternatively, while alphaCoVs serve as the genetic pool of HCoV-229E, alpacas and dromedaries can serve as intermediate hosts that transmit viruses to humans, just as in the case of MERS-CoV.
MERS-CoV serves as an excellent example of interspecies transmission from bats to dromedaries and from dromedaries to humans.
The evolutionary origin of MERS-CoV from bats is known from its initial identification and has been corroborated by subsequent results.
It's obvious that bats provide a rich pool of viral species for interspecies exchange of genetic fragments and interspecies transmission.
Longevity, high-density colonies, close social interaction and high flight ability are all favorable conditions for bats to be the ideal "viral spread".
On the other hand, the introduction of MERS-CoV into dromedaries goes back decades.
He is well adapted to these camels, and has migrated from an intermediate host to a natural and stable reservoir host.
MERS-CoV is a very mild disease-causing disease and maintains a relatively low rate of mutation in these animals.
Its sporadic transmission to humans is an accident, and humans remain terminal hosts of MERS-CoV as its transmission cannot be sustained.
In contrast to the role of camels in MERS-CoV transmission, the role of pangolins, if any, in SARS-CoV-2 transmission is different.
Specifically, pangolin betaCoVs are highly pathogenic in pangolins.
They may be a terminal host for SARS-CoV-2-related betaCoVs, similar to civets in the case of SARS-CoV.
Several possibilities for interspecies transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from animals to humans need to be confirmed or dismissed in future studies.
First, bats could be the reserve host of a SARS-CoV-2 related virus, almost identical to SARS-CoV-2.
Humans could share the ecological niche with bats by slaughter or coal mining.
Second, pangolins could be one of the amplifier intermediate hosts, in which a SARS-CoV-2 related virus had recently been introduced.
Humans get the virus through the slaughter and consumption of game meat.
It is possible that many mammals, including domestic animals, are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2.
Research on antibodies produced from domestic and wild animals is needed.
Thirdly, as mentioned above, recombination and adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 could have occurred in a third species that has contact with both bats and pangolins.
The search for the animal origins of SARS-CoV-2 is still active.
In addition to the different types of animal hosts, three major factors in the virus are important in facilitating the crossing of species barriers by the CoVs.
First, its relatively high rate of mutation in RNA replication.
Compared to other single-tape RNA viruses, estimated mutation rates of the VOCs can be considered to be from 'moderate' to 'high' with an average replacement rate of approximately 10-4 replacements per year per site, depending on the stage of adaptation of the VOC to new hosts.
CoVs have the revision mechanism exorribonuclease, whose exclusion results in excessively high mutability and mitigation, or even inviability.
Interestingly, the remdesivir nucleotide analog suppresses the replication of the VOC by inhibiting this exorribonuclease and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase.
Remdesivir is one of the most promising anti-SARS-CoV-2 agents tested in clinical trials.
However, the mutation rates of the VOCs are almost a million times higher than those of their hosts.
Moreover, the mutation rate is usually high when the CoVs are not well adapted to the host.
Compared to SARS-CoV, which has a high mutation rate, the mutation rate of SARS-CoV-2 is apparently low, suggesting its higher level of adaptation to humans.
Presumably, he has already adapted to another host who keeps in contact with humans.
In addition to SARS-CoV-2, this also applies to MERS-CoV, which is well adapted to dromedaries.
Theoretically, it is unlikely that a genetic change would quickly render SARS-CoV-2 vaccines and antivirals ineffective.
Second, the large RNA genome in CoVs exert extra plasticity in modifying the genome for mutations and recombinations, thus increasing the likelihood of interspecies coevolution, which is advantageous for the emergence of new CoVs when conditions become appropriate.
This is corroborated by the abundance of unique reading frames and encoded protein functions relative to the last three inches of the genome end.
Third, the CoVs randomly and frequently exchange models during RNA replication by means of a unique 'copy-selection' mechanism.
In a host that serves as a mixing vessel, tape exchange often occurs during the transcription of the RNA from the VOC.
Highly homologous and subgenomic long RNAs can recombine to generate new CoVs.
Phylogenetic evidence of natural recombination has been found in both HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43, as well as in animal CoVs such as bat SL-CoV and batCoV-HKU9.
The virus-host interaction with transmission
In addition to the three viral factors mentioned above, viral interaction with the host receptor is another key factor influencing interspecies transmission.
Here, recombination of SARS-CoV is taken as a typical example, which also showed evidence of positive selection during interspecies transmission events.
Based on comparative analysis of SARS-CoV isolates from humans and civets, SARS-CoV is believed to undergo rapid adaptation in different hosts, mainly with mutations in the S protein DLR.
In general, the DLR in the S protein of a VOC interacts with the cellular receptor and is highly selected by the host antibody response.
In SARS-CoV, DLR is in the amino acids 318o to 510o in the S1 fragment, which binds to human ECA2, as well as its correceptors for viral entry.
The SARS-CoV DLR is capable of recognizing ECA2 receptors from several animals, including bats, civets, mice and rat dogs, enabling interspecies transmission of the virus.
In fact, only six amino acid residues were observed to be different from human and civet viral isolates in the DLR, and four of them are located on the receptor-binding motif for interaction with the ECA2 receptor.
Civet SARS-CoV has K479N and S487T mutations in its DLR, which could increase the affinity of spike protein interaction with the human ECA2 receptor.
In other words, these two amino acid substitutes could be critical for viral adaptation in humans.
It is worth noting that SARS-CoV-2 shares the same cellular receptor with SARS-CoV.
A 30% difference between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV in S1 unit of S protein implies that the binding affinity of its S protein to human ECA2 could have been altered.
In fact, an electron chromomycoscopy study indicates a 10 to 20 times greater affinity for this link than between human ECA2 and SARS-CoV S protein.
It will also be useful to determine whether any other correceptor may be needed for transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
It's intriguing that HCoV-NL63 also binds to ECA2, but with a different part of the S protein.
There are several other HCoV receptors, such as aminopeptidase N for HCoV-229E and 9-O-acetyl sialic acid for HCoV-OC43.
They could also respond by effectively adapting these CoVs to humans after interspecies transmission from their animal hosts.
In addition to cellular receptors, the outcome of interspecies transmission of HCoVs is also governed by other factors of restriction and host dependence.
The divergence of these host proteins between humans and HCoVs' natural reservoir hosts such as bats, dromedaries and rodents could constitute a barrier to interspecies transmission.
HCoVs need to usurp host dependence factors and subvert host restriction factors for effective interspecies transmission.
In this sense, the molecular determinants in this important area of virus-host interaction still need to be identified and characterized.
Non-biased screening with genome-wide scope of host dependence and restrictive factors for SARS-CoV-2 using modern CRISPR technology can yield good results.
Emergence of new HCoVs: Back to the zero stake
The diversity of bats' CoVs provides wide possibilities for the emergence of new HCoVs.
In this sense, bats' COVs serve as a genetic pool of HCoVs.
In addition, rapid mutation and genetic recombination also drive the evolution of HCoV and serve as two important steps in this process.
For example, the acquisition or loss of new protein-coding genes has the potential to drastically alter viral phenotypes.
Among the SARS-CoV ancillary proteins, ORF8 is believed to be important in its adaptation to humans, since SARS-CoV-related bat viruses have been isolated, but they have been found to encode divergent ORF8 proteins.
A nucleotide 29 exclusion feature of SARS-CoVs was discovered in isolated strains at the beginning of the human epidemic.
The exclusion divides ORF8 into ORF8a and ORF8b, and it is believed to be an adaptive mutation that promotes host alternation.
In addition, SARS-CoV has a possible recombination history with alphaCoVs and gammaCoVs lineages, where a large number of smaller recombinant regions have been identified in RNA-dependent RNA polymerase.
Recombination sites have also been identified in nsp9, most of nsp10 and parts of nsp14.
Similarly, it has been demonstrated that the epidemic MERS-CoV has undergone recombination events between different lineages, which occurred in dromedaries in Saudi Arabia.
In addition to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, recombination events have also been observed in other HCoVs, in which HCoVs recombine with other animal CoVs in their non-structural genes.
It should also be noted that artificial selection may contribute to unwanted changes in viral genomes, likely resulting from the relief of selection pressure on viruses, such as host immune system pressure.
An example of these effects is the loss of a long ORF4 in the HCoV-229E prototype strain due to the exclusion of two nucleotides.
While intact ORF4 can be observed in bats and camel viruses related to HCoV-229E, alpaca alphaCoV presents a simple insertion of nucleotides, resulting in a change in frames.
Last but not least, the evolution of new HCoVs is also driven by selection pressure in their reservoirs.
No symptoms or only mild symptoms were detected in bats when infected with CoVs, indicating mutual adaptation between CoVs and bats.
It is likely that bats are well adapted to the VOCs anatomically and physiologically.
For example, defects in activating the pro-inflammatory response in bats effectively reduce pathology triggered by the CoVs.
In addition, the activity of natural exterminating cells in bats is suppressed due to the adaptation of the natural exterminating cell receptor NKG2/CD94 inhibitor and the low degree of expression of class I molecules of the main histotocompatibility complex.
In addition, the high level of reactive oxygen species (ERO) generated from high metabolic activity in bats may both suppress the replication of the VOC and affect exorribonuclease review, thus providing selective pressure for the generation of highly pathogenic virus strains when introduced into a new host.
More pathogenic strains of CoV could also evolve by recombination, leading to the acquisition of new proteins or protein characteristics for host adaptation.
So it's no coincidence that three new HCoVs have emerged in the last two decades.
CoVs are nonpathogenic, or cause at most mild symptoms in their reservoir hosts, such as bats and camels.
They replicate immensely without provoking a high immune response from the host.
This document provides explanations for the discovery of asymptomatic carriers and the cause of serious cases of human infection.
Severe symptoms are mainly due to hyperactivation of the immune response and cytokine cascade, where the greater the immune response, the more severe the lung damage.
In contrast, in asymptomatic carriers, the immune response was switched off from the replication of the VOC.
The same immune response shutdown strategy could have beneficial effects on SARS-CoV-2 therapy.
The interferon response is particularly strong in bats.
Therefore, administration of type I interferon at the early stage of SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans should be beneficial.
In addition, the activation of NLRP3 inflammatory factor in bats is poor.
Following this reasoning, inhibition of the inflammatory NLRP3 with MCC950 could be useful in the treatment of COVID-19.
The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 follows the same principles as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
While betaCoV of bats has been found to share 95% nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV, there is a bat VC that shares 96% nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV-2.
Although it has been found that civets and other animals in the markets host viruses identical to SARS-CoV, intermediate hosts for SARS-CoV-2 have not been identified.
Pangolin betaCoVs, with high homology to SARS-CoV-2, have been discovered, indicating that pangolins may serve as one of the intermediate hosts, or pangolin betaCoVs may contribute genetic fragments to the final version of SARS-CoV-2.
While questions remain, there is no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 is accidentally or intentionally produced by humans.
The COVID-19s have returned to global attention due to the recent SARS-CoV-2 outbreak.
The study of CoVs in bats and other animals has dramatically changed our perception of the importance of zoonotic origins and animal reservoirs of HCoVs in human transmission.
Widespread evidence shows that SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 originate from bats and are transmitted to humans through intermediate hosts.
Since SARS-CoV infection originated from contact between humans and civets in markets, the closure of wet markets and the slaughter of civets in those markets could have put an end to the SARS epidemic.
Following the same reasoning, pangolins should be removed from wet markets to prevent zoonotic transmission, as multiple pangolins beta-CoV lineages closely related to SARS-CoV-2 have been discovered.
However, it is still to be clarified in future studies whether SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted to humans through pangolins and other mammals, and how this transmission is carried out.
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has been around in dromedaries for a long time.
These camels serve as an important means of transportation, and are an essential source of meat, milk, leather, and wool for the local community.
They are widely distributed in the Middle East and Africa.
Therefore, it is impossible to sacrifice all camels for MERS control, as has been done in wildlife markets in China to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
To stop recurrent MERS outbreaks, a comprehensive approach should be adopted to develop effective vaccines against MERS-CoV for camels, in combination with other infection control measures.
Since we can't eliminate these viruses, new genotypes could emerge and cause epidemics.
A variety of zoonotic COVs circulate in the wild.
Specifically, the VOCs of bats with zoonotic potential are very diverse.
There are several possibilities that these zoonotic CoVs will evolve and recombine, resulting in the emergence of new CoVs that are more transmissible and/or lethal to humans in the future.
The culture of eating wild animals in some parts of China must be abandoned to reduce unnecessary contact between humans and animals.
With the SARS, MERS and COVID-19 crises, a better response and preparedness plan should be adopted.
In fact, many viruses have been around for a long time.
They stay in their natural reservoirs until there's a chance of migrating to another species.
Although bats have many characteristics that favor the spread of the virus, the chance that people will be in contact with bats and other wild species can be minimized if people are taught to stay away from them.
Continuous monitoring in mammals is necessary for a better understanding of the ecology of the VOCs and their natural hosts, which will prove useful in preventing animal transmission to humans and future epidemics.
To conclude, the most effective way to prevent viral zoonoses is to keep people away from the ecological niches of the natural reservoirs of zoonotic viruses.
Several pieces of the zoonotic origin puzzle of SARS-CoV-2 are still missing.
First, if bats transmit an ancestral SARS-CoV-2 virus to pangolins, it is important to find out under what circumstances bats and pangolins could share the same ecological niche.
Second, if bats play a more direct role in transmission to humans, it should be determined how people come into contact with bats.
Third, if a third mammal has the role of the true intermediate host, it needs to be clarified how it interacts with different species, including humans, bats, and pangolins.
Finally, since several mammals, including domestic animals, may be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2, both surveillance and experimental infection should be carried out.
If it is a bat, pangolin or other mammal, SARS-CoV-2 or its parent viruses that are almost identical are expected to be identified in their natural hosts in the future.
Continued research in this area will shed light on the evolutionary pathway of SARS-CoV-2 in animals, with important implications for the prevention and control of COVID-19 in humans.
It is necessary to update the diagnostic criteria for "suspect case" and "confirmed case" of COVID-19
On February 6, 2020, our team published a quick guidance guide to the diagnosis and treatment of the 2019 new coronavirus infection (2019-nCoV). This guide conveys our experience and is a good reference for combating this global pandemic.
However, the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is new. Our understanding and knowledge is gradually increasing based on the constant findings of research and experiences in clinical practice; due to this, diagnostic and treatment strategies are also continuously updated.
In this letter, we respond to a comment on our guide and provide the latest diagnostic criteria for "suspect case" and "confirmed case" according to the latest COVID-19 Diagnosis and Treatment Guidelines (seventh version) published by the National Health Committee of the People's Republic of China.
In December 2019, the new 2019 coronavirus (2019-nCoV) caused an outbreak, which is officially now referred to as the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19), and the virus is referred to as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2).
On 11 March 2020, the WHO classified COVID-19 as a pandemic.
In order to combat SARS-CoV-2 infection, our team developed a quick guidance guide published online in Military Medical Research on February 6, 2020.
It has attracted excellent attention since publication.
However, note that COVID-19 is a new disease. Our understanding and knowledge is gradually increasing based on the constant findings of research and experiences in clinical practice; as a result, diagnostic and treatment strategies are also continually updated.
For example, the COVID-19 Diagnostic and Treatment Guides published by the National Health Committee of the People's Republic of China (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/) between 16 January 2020 and 3 March 2020 have a total of seven editions with substantial changes in context in some.
Our guide has now received a comment from Zhou et al., who presented a simple score proposal based on their clinical experience.
This work has added new evidence to our guide and also makes valuable references to this global pandemic.
We endorse your significant work and express our gratitude.
However, their work also needs to be updated in accordance with the latest COVID-19 Diagnostic and Treatment Guidelines (seventh trial version) and recent studies.
According to the seventh edition (3 March 2020), to confirm the suspected case, it is necessary to combine one item of epidemiological history with two items of clinical manifestations to perform a comprehensive analysis, or it is necessary to comply with three items of clinical manifestations where there is no clear epidemiological history:
Epidemiological history: (1) a history of travel or residence in Wuhan city and nearby areas or other communities where cases of COVID-19 were reported in the last 14 days prior to the onset of symptoms; (2) a history of contact with infectious cases of SARS-CoV-2 (with positive nucleic acid test); (3) a history of contact with patients with fever or respiratory symptoms originating in Wuhan city and nearby areas or other communities where cases of COVID-19 were reported in the last 14 days prior to the onset of symptoms; (4) a history of contact with a group of confirmed cases (greater than or equal to two cases of fever and/or respiratory symptoms occurring within 2 weeks in small spaces such as home, office, classroom, etc.).
Clinical manifestations: (1) fever and/or respiratory symptoms; (2) with imaging diagnostic features of COVID-19 infection; (3) total white blood cell counts showing normal, decreased or reduced lymphocyte counts at the initial stage of symptom onset.
The diagnosis of the confirmed case should be based on a suspicious case with any of the following serological or pathogenic items: (1) positive PCR test for SARS-CoV-2; (2) complete viral genome sequencing showing high homogeneity with respect to new known coronaviruses; (3) positive for serum test-specific IgM and IgG antibodies for SARS-CoV-2; or any change in the IgG antibody for SARS-CoV-2 from negative to positive or an increase in title greater than or equal to four times in the recovery phase above that in the acute phase.
We can note that the real-time PCR test for nucleic acid in blood or respiratory tract samples has been added to the second and third editions (January 18 and 22, 2020 respectively).
Pathogenic detection of blood sample was added to the fourth and fifth editions (27 January 2020 and 8 February 2020 respectively), and the serological evidence was added to the seventh edition.
These modifications are based on the ongoing work of researchers in search of an ideal nucleic acid detection kit for rapid diagnosis and respiratory tract samples, including blood sampling, which increased the availability of different specimens and helped bring the positive result of specific antibodies to the confirmed criteria.
In addition, there is increasing evidence that reminds us to pay attention to atypical symptomatic and asymptomatic patients.
Therefore, the fluxogram of Zhou et al. should be updated as it classifies the person without clinical symptoms as 'at low risk'.
The scoring system also needs to be checked in further studies and clinical practices.
In conclusion, we look forward to more direct evidence and ask readers to provide their comments.
For the diagnosis of "suspect case" and "confirmed case", we suggest that you check and follow the latest guidelines in your home countries.
Our team will also update our guide in due course to offer help.
Bangladesh reports five new deaths due to COVID-19, the highest daily number
Yesterday, Bangladesh confirmed five new deaths due to COVID-19 on the day.
That's the highest number of deaths in a single day from the virus.
On Tuesday, the Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research of Bangladesh (IEDCR) reported that the number of confirmed cases recorded included 114 active cases and 33 recovered cases remaining at home.
A total of 17 deaths have been recorded.
In an online news release, IEDCR director Dr. Meerjady Sabrina Flora said that the deaths included four men and one woman.
According to Dr. Meerjady, two cases were over 60, two were between 51 and 60 and one was between 41 and 50.
She also said two of the victims were from Dhaka.
The World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a pandemic on March 11.
A hospital officer told Anadolu Agency, a local news agency, that one of the dead was Jalal Saifur Rahman, director of the Bengal Anti-Corruption Commission, who was treated at Kuwait Maitree Hospital.
On Saturday, in an online video statement, Bengali Minister of Road Transport and Bridges Obaidul Quader said that public transport would be paralyzed for longer than originally planned until next Saturday.
This public transport shutdown began on 26 March and was scheduled to end on Saturday, 4 April.
Transport of essential products (medical products, fuel and food) was still permitted.
The first cases of COVID-19 infection in Bangladesh were recorded on March 8, in two people who returned from Italy and also in the wife of one of them.
By March 19, the three had recovered.
SARS-CoV-2 has surpassed one million infections worldwide
On Thursday, the total number of cases of coronavirus infections by SARS-CoV-2 in the world exceeded one million, data from Johns Hopkins University indicated.
At least 52,000 deaths were linked to COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus.
This milestone came on the same day that Malawi confirmed its first coronavirus infections and Zambia had its first virus-related death.
North Korea said that until Thursday it was one of the few remaining countries free of coronavirus infections.
As of yesterday, the World Health Organization reported 1,051,635 confirmed cases, including 79,332 cases in the 24 hours before 10 a.m. Central European Time (0800 UTC) on April 4.
In the United States, more than 244,000 cases of coronavirus have been recorded, linked to at least 5,900 deaths.
CBS News reported, citing data from Johns Hopkins University, that there were more than 1,000 deaths in the U.S. caused by coronavirus infections on Wednesday.
Countries around the world have announced tougher measures to curb the spread of the disease.
On Thursday, Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin extended the total blockade of the city until May 1.
On the national level, President Vladimir Putin declared that Russians would continue to be paid without attending work until April 30.
The Portuguese Parliament voted to extend the national state of emergency by 15 days, with 215 votes in favour, 10 abstentions and one vote against.
Saudi Arabia has extended the duration of the day-long gathering in the holy cities of Mecca and Medina, previously only from 3 to 6 p.m.
Thailand plans to implement a 10pm to 4pm pick-up call
Ohio Governor Mike DeWine announced that the state had extended the stay-at-home order until May 1.
Shops in Australia cut toilet paper limits per transaction
On Saturday and Sunday night, Australian store chains Woolworths and Coles reduced their restrictions on purchasing toilet paper to two packs and one packet per transaction in every store in the country, respectively.
On Monday, ALDI also implemented a one-package limit.
These limitations were communicated by messages in boxes and Facebook pages of the networks.
Out of fear of COVID-19, shoppers were reportedly stocking up in case there was a need to isolate themselves.
On Wednesday, Woolworths also limited home delivery toilet paper purchases to one package on demand.
These changes came after the previous four-package transaction restriction implemented by Woolworths and Coles on 4 and 5 March respectively.
Coles, in its March 8 press release, reported that even with the four-pack restriction, "many stores are still running out of stock in less than an hour after delivery" and called the demand "unprecedented", while ALDI called it "unexpected" in a Facebook post on Tuesday.
Sales were up sharply last week, according to a Woolworths spokesman.
Costco's Camberra store also limited the amount allowed to two packages last week.
To further alleviate the shortage, Coles ordered larger packages from suppliers and increased frequency of delivery, Woolworths ordered extra stock, while ALDI made stock available in advance for a promotion planned for Wednesday.
Russel Zimmerman, executive director of the Australian Retailers' Association, said retailers are trying to increase inventory, but local board restrictions on frequency of truck deliveries make this difficult.
He expects high production costs, as suppliers try to meet demand, and fewer promotions.
On Tuesday, ALDI announced that after the early release of the stock, some stores will not be able to hold the Wednesday promotion.
In a News.com.au report, Dr. Gary Mortimer, a retail specialist at Queensland University of Technology, said stores replenish the stock every night.
He pointed out that toilet paper is a bulky item with low quantity in stock, and that when depleted, it leaves many empty spaces on shelves, increasing the feeling of scarcity.
Coles and Woolworths are of the opinion that if there were an abundance of them on shelves, if products like toilet paper rolls and antiseptics could be bought and were there in quantities, you would probably reduce panic, Russell Zimmerman told ABC News.
The recycled toilet paper manufacturer Who Gives the Crap said last Wednesday they would run out of stock.
Kimberly-Clark, which produces Kleenex toilet paper, and Solaris Paper, which produces Sorbent, stressed that they were working 24 hours a day 7 days a week to maintain supply, according to a News.com.au report.
The real estate website domain.com reported that some real estate sellers were offering free toilet paper to early auction bidders in Melbourne, when fewer auctions were being held with buyers entering on holiday on the extended Labor Day weekend.
The Thursday edition of NT News, a printed Darwin diary, included an eight-page insert intended to be cut and used as toilet paper.
Initially, stores were reluctant to impose restrictions, according to a March 3 report by ABC Australia in which they said they had no plans to implement restrictions on purchases.
Russell Zimmerman added that other products are also in high demand, such as masks, antiseptics, dry products, hand soaps and flour.
As in Australia, on Sunday night, the British online supermarket Ocado limited the purchase of Andres toilet paper to two 12-reel packages.
World Health Organization declares COVID-19 a pandemic
On Wednesday, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the current outbreak of COVID-19  the disease caused by the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2  to be a pandemic.
While the word "pandemic" only indicates the extent to which a disease spreads, not how dangerous specific cases are, WHO stressed the need to push governments to act:
All countries can still change the course of this pandemic.
If countries are able to detect, test, treat, isolate, track and mobilize the population for a response, said Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General.
We are very concerned about the alarming levels of spread and gravity and the alarming levels of inaction.
According to Dr. Tom Frieden, former director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, it is a "precedence-less" pandemic.
In comments published by CNN in February, he stated that "except for influenza, no other respiratory virus has been monitored from the onset to its continued global spread".
Ghebreyesus expressed a similar position, stating that "we had never seen a pandemic started by a coronavirus".
And he continued, "and we've never seen a pandemic that could be controlled at the same time".
The new pandemic status follows the WHO's decision in January to declare the outbreak a public health emergency of international concern.
Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said that the outbreak "will, in short, get worse".
On Thursday, the Associated Press reported that there were at least 126,000 cases of COVID-19 worldwide, with more than 4,600 deaths.
The 201920 coronavirus pandemic is an ongoing pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome 2 (SARS-CoV-2) coronavirus.
The outbreak was identified in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, declared an international public health emergency of international concern on 30 January 2020 and recognized as a pandemic on 11 March 2020.
As of 10 April 2020, approximately 1.61 million cases of COVID-19 had been reported in 210 countries and territories, with approximately 97,000 deaths.
Some 364,000 people recovered.
The mortality rate is estimated to be 4% in China, while globally it ranges from 13.04% in Algeria to 0.08% in New Zealand.
Common symptoms include fever, cough and shortness of breath.
Complications may include pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome.
The time from exposure to onset of symptoms is approximately five days, but may vary from two to fourteen days.
There is no known specific vaccine or antiviral treatment.
The primary treatment is symptomatic and supportive therapy. Recommended prevention measures include washing hands, covering the mouth when coughing, keeping distance from people and monitoring and isolating people with suspected infection.
Authorities around the world responded by implementing travel restrictions, quarantines, collection points, workplace risk controls and closure of establishments.
The pandemic has caused a severe global socioeconomic disruption, the postponement or cancellation of sporting, religious, political and cultural events and widespread supply shortages exacerbated by panic-induced purchases.
Schools and universities have closed nationally or locally in 193 countries, affecting approximately 99.4% of the world's student population.
Misinformation about the virus has spread online and there have been incidents of xenophobia and discrimination against Chinese people, people of East and Southeast Asian descent and appearance and other people from areas with significant cases of the virus.
Due to reduced travel and heavy industry closures, there has been a decrease in air pollution and carbon emissions.
Health authorities in Wuhan, China (the capital of Hubei Province) reported a group of cases of pneumonia from unknown cause on 31 December 2019 and an investigation was initiated in early January 2020.
The cases were largely linked to the wholesale market of Huanan seafood and therefore the virus is believed to have zoonotic origins.
The virus causing the outbreak is known as SARS-CoV-2, a recently discovered virus that has close links to the bat, pangolin and SARS-CoV coronaviruses. The first person with symptoms known to have become ill on 1 December 2019 and had no visible connections to the later group of seafood market.
The Commission also concluded that the Commission had not yet established a market link between the two types of market surveillance and the market surveillance.
On 13 March 2020, an unverified report by the South China Morning Post suggested that one case pointed to 17 November 2019, in a 55-year-old individual from Hubei province, who may have been the first. On 26 February 2020, WHO reported that as new reported cases declined in China but suddenly increased in Italy, Iran and South Korea, the number of new cases outside China had exceeded the number of new cases in China for the first time.
There may be significant underreporting of cases, especially among people with milder symptoms.
By 26 February, relatively few cases had been reported among young people aged 19 and under, accounting for 2.4% of cases worldwide.The UK's leading scientific adviser Patrick Vallance estimated that 60% of the British population would need to be infected until effective collective immunity could be achieved.
Cases refer to the number of people who have been tested for COVID-19 and whose tests have been confirmed positive according to official protocols.
As of March 23, no country had tested more than 3% of its population and several countries adopted official policies not to test people with only mild symptoms, such as Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland.
A study published on March 16 found that in China, by January 23, it was estimated that 86% of COVID-19 infections had not been detected and that these undocumented infections were the source of infection for 79% of the documented cases.
A statistical analysis published on 30 March estimated that the number of infected people in Italy was considerably higher than the reported cases.
Initial estimates of the basic reproduction number (R0) for COVID-19 were 1.4 to 2.4.
A study published by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention concluded that it could be 5.7.
Most people with COVID-19 recover.
For those who do not recover, the time from the onset of symptoms to death has been between 6 and 41 days, with 14 days being the most common.
As of April 10, 2020, approximately 97,000 deaths have been attributed to COVID-19.
In China, as of February 5, approximately 80% of deaths occurred in people over 60 years of age and 75% had pre-existing medical conditions, including cardiovascular disease and diabetes.The official death count from the COVID-19 pandemic usually refers to people who died and who tested positive for COVID, according to official protocols.
The actual number of deaths from COVID-19 can be much higher, since it may not include people who died without having been tested, for example, those who died at home, in nursing homes, etc.
Partial data from Italy showed that the additional death toll during the pandemic exceeded the official death toll from COVID by a factor of 4-5x.
A spokeswoman for the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) acknowledged that "we know [the official death toll] is underestimated", a statement corroborated by episodic reports of underreporting in the U.S. This underestimation often occurs in pandemics, such as the 2009 H1N1 swine flu epidemic.
The first death outside China occurred on February 1st in the Philippines, and the first death outside Asia occurred in France on February 14th.
By February 28, outside China, more than a dozen deaths had already been recorded in Iran, South Korea and Italy.
As of 13 March, more than 40 countries and territories had reported deaths on all continents except Antarctica.
These numbers vary by region and over time and are influenced by the volume of tests, quality of the health system, treatment options, time since the initial outbreak and population characteristics such as age, sex and overall health.
Based on Johns Hopkins University statistics, the overall fatality rate is 6.0% (97.039/1.617.204) as of April 10, 2020.
The number varies by region.
In China, estimates of the fatality rate have dropped from 17.3% (in people with symptoms beginning between 110 January 2020) to 0.7% (for people with symptoms beginning after 1 February 2020).Other measures include the fatality rate (CFR), which represents the percentage of people diagnosed who die from a disease, and the infection fatality rate (IFR), which represents the percentage of infected (diagnosed and undiagnosed) who die from the disease.
These statistics are not static over time and follow a specific population of infection through case resolution.
Some academics have tried to calculate these numbers for specific populations.
The Oxford University Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine estimates that the infection fatality rate for the pandemic, in general, is between 0.1% and 0.39%.
The upper estimate of this range is consistent with the results of the first randomized COVID-19 test in Germany and with a statistical study that analysed the impact of the tests on CFR estimates.
WHO says the pandemic can be controlled.
The peak and maximum duration of the outbreak are uncertain and may change depending on the location.
Maciej Boni of Pennsylvania State University stated that "without proper control, infectious epidemics usually peak and then decline when no longer available hosts for the disease.
But it is almost impossible to make any appropriate projection at the moment as to when this will occur".
The Chinese government's senior medical adviser, Zhong Nanshan, argued that "it could be over by June" if all countries mobilize to follow WHO recommendations regarding measures to prevent the spread of the virus.
On 17 March, Adam Kucharski of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine stated that SARS-CoV-2 "will likely continue to circulate for a year or two".
According to a study by Imperial College, led by Neil Ferguson, physical distancing and other measures will be needed "until a vaccine is available (potentially in 18 months or more)".
William Schaffner of Vanderbilt University stated: "I do not think it is likely that this coronavirus will disappear completely, since it is highly transmissible" and "that it could become a seasonal disease, reappearing every year".
The virulence of the recurrence will depend on the group immunity and extent of the mutation.
The symptoms of COVID-19 can be relatively nonspecific and infected people can be asymptomatic.
The two most common symptoms are fever (88%) and dry cough (68%).
The least common symptoms include fatigue, production of respiratory secretion (diarrhea), loss of sense of smell, shortness of breath, muscle and joint pain, sore throat, headache, colds, vomiting, hemoptysis, diarrhea or cyanosis. WHO says that about one in six people becomes seriously ill and has difficulty breathing.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) lists that emergency symptoms include difficulty breathing, persistent chest pain or pressure, sudden confusion, difficulty walking, and blue-colored face or lips. It is advisable to seek medical help if these symptoms are present.
Some of the infected people may be asymptomatic, with no clinical symptoms, but with test results confirming infection, therefore, researchers recommend that those who have been in close contact with a person with a confirmed infection be closely monitored and examined to rule out infection.
Chinese estimates of the asymptomatic rate range from a few to 44%.
The usual incubation period (the time between the onset of infection and symptoms) varies from one to 14 days, but is usually five days. As an example of uncertainty, the estimate of the proportion of people with COVID-19 who lost their sense of smell was initially 30% and later dropped to 15%.
Some details about how the disease spreads are still being determined.
It is believed that this disease is spread mainly by close contact and by small droplets produced during the act of coughing, sneezing or talking, with close contact being considered to be 1 to 2 metres (3 to 6 feet).
Studies have found that coughing without covering your mouth can cause droplets to reach from 15 feet [4.5 m] to 27 feet [8.2 m].
Some people have suggested that the virus can also be transmitted by droplets that remain in the air for longer periods, which may have been generated during a conversation. Breathing droplets can also be produced during exhalation, including when speaking, although the virus is not normally in suspension.
The droplets can land in the mouth and nose of people nearby or possibly be inhaled by the lungs.
Some medical procedures, such as intubation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), can cause respiratory secretions to cloudy, resulting in airborne spread.
It can also occur when someone touches a contaminated surface, including the skin, and then touches their own eyes, nose, or mouth.
While there is concern that it may spread through feces, the risk of this happening is believed to be low.
The Chinese government has denied the possibility of oro-fecal transmission of SARS-CoV-2. The virus is most contagious during the first three days after symptoms appear, although transmission may be possible before symptoms appear and in later stages of the disease.
Positive tests for the disease have been conducted up to three days before symptoms appear, suggesting that transmission is possible even before significant symptoms develop.
There are only a few laboratory-confirmed reports of asymptomatic cases, but asymptomatic transmission has been identified in some countries during contact tracking investigations.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) states that although it is not entirely clear how easily the disease spreads, one person usually infects two to three other people.
Specifically, it was found that the virus is detectable for up to three days in plastic (polypropylene) and 304 stainless steel, for one day in cardboard and for up to four hours in copper.
This, however, varies according to humidity and temperature.
There is no evidence that animals can pass the virus on to humans, but British authorities advise washing hands after contact with animals and after contact with surfaces that infected people may have touched.
The severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV-2) coronavirus 2 is a new virus, isolated for the first time from three people with pneumonia connected to a set of acute respiratory disease cases in Wuhan.
All features of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus resemble those of related coronaviruses in nature. Outside the human body, the virus dies from homemade soap, which dissolves its protective envelope.
It is believed to have zoonotic origin.
Genetic analysis revealed that the coronavirus is genetically associated with the genus Betacoronavirus, subgenus Sarbecovirus (lineage B).
It has 96% similarity, across the genome level, to other bat-derived coronavirus samples (BatCoV RaTG13).
In February 2020, Chinese researchers discovered that there is only one amino acid difference in certain parts of the genome sequences between pangolin and human viruses.
The comparison of the entire genome so far has found a maximum of 92% genetic material sharing between the pangolins coronavirus and SARS-CoV-2, which is insufficient to prove that pangolins are the intermediate host.
Virus infection can be provisionally diagnosed based on symptoms, but definitive confirmation is by reverse transcription followed by polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) of infected secretions or by computed tomography (CT).
A study done in Wuhan comparing rRT-PCR to CT suggested that CT is significantly more sensitive, though less specific, with many of its imaging characteristics coinciding with other pneumonia and pathological processes.
Since March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommends that "CTs not be used for screening or as a frontline test for the diagnosis of COVID-19".
WHO has published several RNA testing protocols for SARS-CoV-2, the first of which was published on 17 January.
The test uses reverse transcription followed by real-time polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR).
The test can be done on breathing or blood samples.
Results are usually available within a few hours to days.
Usually this test is performed with nasopharyngeal rubbing, although throat rubbing is also used. Several laboratories and companies are developing serological tests capable of detecting antibodies.
As of 6 April 2020, none of these had been proven to be sufficiently accurate to be approved for general use.
A serological test developed by Cellex in the United States has been approved for emergency use only by certified laboratories.
The characteristics of X-ray and CT images of symptomatic people include asymmetrical peripheral opacity in dark glass and absence of pleural effusions.
The Italian Radiological Society is putting together an online international database of confirmed case imaging results.
Due to overlapping with other infections such as that of adenovirus, images without PCR confirmation are of limited specificity in identifying COVID-19.
A large study in China compared the results of chest CT to PCR and showed that although the image is less specific to infection, it is faster and more sensitive, suggesting its consideration as a research tool in epidemic areas.
Artificial intelligence-based convolutional neural networks have been developed for detecting the characteristics of virus imaging using X-rays and CT scans.
Strategies to prevent transmission of the disease include maintaining good overall personal hygiene, washing hands, avoiding touching the eyes, nose or mouth without washing hands, coughing or sneezing on a paper cloth and placing this cloth directly in a waste container.
Those who have been infected are advised to wear a surgical mask in public.
Physical distancing measures are also recommended to prevent transmission, and many governments have restricted or discouraged non-essential travel to and from countries and areas affected by the outbreak.
The virus, however, has reached the stage of Community spread in vast regions of the world.
This means that the virus is spreading within communities and that some community members do not know where or how they have been infected. Healthcare professionals who care for individuals who may be infected are advised to use standard precautions, contact precautions and eye protection. Contact tracking is an important method for health authorities to determine the source of an infection and to prevent further transmission.
The use of location data from mobile phones by governments for this purpose has raised privacy concerns, with Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations issuing a statement calling for limits on this type of surveillance.
Several mobile apps have been implemented or proposed for voluntary use. As of April 7, 2020, more than a dozen expert groups are working on privacy-friendly solutions such as using Bluetooth to record a user's proximity to other mobile phones.
Users then receive a message if they have been in close contact with someone who has tested positive for COVID-19. Some misconceptions about how to prevent infection have circulated, such as rinsing the nose and gargling with colutars, which have already proven ineffective.
There is no vaccine against COVID-19. However, several organizations are working to develop one.
Hand washing is recommended to prevent the spread of the disease.
The CDC recommends that people wash their hands frequently with soap and water for at least twenty seconds, especially after using the toilet or when their hands are visibly dirty.
That's because outside the human body, the virus is killed by homemade soap, which breaks its protective layer.
The CDC also recommends using an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with a minimum alcohol content of 60% when no soap and water are readily available.
WHO advises that you avoid touching your eyes, nose or mouth without washing your hands.
Surfaces can be decontaminated with several solutions (within up to one minute of disinfectant exposure to a stainless steel surface), including ethanol at 6271%, isopropyl alcohol at 50100%, sodium hypochlorite at 0,1%, hydrogen peroxide at 0,5% and iodopovidone at 0,27,5%.
Other solutions, such as benzalcone chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate, are less effective.
The CDC recommends that in case of suspected or confirmed COVID-19 in a location such as an office or a daycare center, all areas such as offices, bathrooms, common areas, shared electronic equipment such as tablets, touchscreens, keyboards, remote controls and electronic boxes used by sick people should be disinfected.
Health organizations recommend covering your mouth and nose with your elbow bent or with a paper cloth when coughing or sneezing, and discarding any cloth immediately.
Surgical masks are recommended for those who may be infected, as wearing a mask can limit the volume and distance of displacement of the expiratory droplets when speaking, sneezing, or coughing.
WHO has published instructions on when and how to wear masks.
According to Stephen Griffin, a virologist at the University of Leeds, "Wearing masks can reduce people's propensity to touch their faces, which is one of the biggest sources of infection without proper hand hygiene".
WHO has recommended the use of masks by healthy people only when they are at high risk, such as caregivers of people with COVID-19, although they also acknowledge that wearing masks can help people not touch their own face.
In several countries, the use of face masks by the general public has begun to be encouraged.
In the US, the CDC recommends the use of a non-medical face mask made of cloth. China has specifically recommended the use of disposable medical masks by healthy people in general, especially when coming into close contact with another person (staying 1 meter or less away).
In Hong Kong, surgical masks are recommended when using public transport or when staying in crowded places.
Thailand's health authorities are encouraging people to make cloth face masks at home and wash them daily.
In the Czech Republic and Slovakia, it is forbidden to go out in public without wearing a mask or covering your nose and mouth.
On March 16, Vietnam requested that everyone wear a face mask when going out in public areas to protect themselves and others.
The Austrian government has demanded that everyone entering supermarkets must wear a face mask.
In Israel, all residents were asked to wear face masks in public.
Taiwan, which has been producing 10 million masks a day since mid-March, has demanded that passengers on inter-city trains and buses wear face masks from April 1.
In Panama, wearing a face mask is mandatory when going outdoors, while at the same time, it is recommended that those who cannot afford to buy a face mask be produced at home.
Face masks have also been widely used in Japan, South Korea, Malaysia and Singapore.
Social distancing (also known as physical distancing) involves infection control actions aimed at slowing down disease transmission by reducing close contact between individuals.
Methods include quarantines, travel restrictions and the closure of schools, workplaces, stadiums, theatres or shopping centres.
Social distancing methods can be applied by all by staying at home, limiting their travel, avoiding crowded areas, using contactless greetings, and keeping distance from others.
At present, many governments are mandating or recommending social distancing in epidemic-affected regions.
The maximum number of people gathered recommended by U.S. government agencies and health organizations was quickly reduced from 250 people (if there is no knowledge of COVID-19 transmission in a region) to 50 people and subsequently to 10 people.
On 22 March 2020, Germany banned public meetings of more than two people. Older adults and those with underlying diseases such as diabetes, heart disease, respiratory disease, hypertension and compromised immune systems face a higher risk of serious illnesses and complications, and the CDC advises them to stay home as much as possible in areas of community epidemic.
The use of the term "social distancing" has led to implications that social isolation was needed entirely rather than encouraging contact through other alternative means.
These recommendations include having sex only with someone you live with who does not have the virus or symptoms of the virus.
Home self-isolation was recommended for those diagnosed with COVID-19 and for those suspected of being infected.
Health agencies have issued detailed instructions for proper self-isolation, and many governments have required or recommended self-quarantine for entire populations living in affected areas.
The most stringent self-quarantine instructions have been issued for those in high-risk groups.
Individuals who may have been exposed to others with COVID-19 and who have recently travelled to a country or region with widespread transmission were advised to self-quarantine for 14 days from the time of the last possible exposure.
The strategies for controlling an outbreak are containment or suppression and reduction.
Containment is carried out in the early stages of an outbreak and aims to track and isolate infected persons, as well as to introduce other infection control measures and vaccines to prevent the spread of the disease to the rest of the population.
When the spread of disease is no longer possible, efforts are made to reduce it: the measures now taken are intended to slow the spread and reduce its adverse effects on the health system and on the population.
Containment and mitigation measures may be taken simultaneously in combination.
Suppression calls for more extreme measures to reverse the pandemic to a basic reproductive rate below 1. Managing an outbreak of infectious disease is partly about trying to reduce the peak of the epidemic.
This reduces the risk of overloading health services, giving more time for vaccines and treatments to be developed.
Interventions other than pharmaceutical ones that can manage the outbreak include personal prevention measures such as hand hygiene, the use of face masks and self-quarantine; Community measures aimed at physical distancing, such as closing schools and cancelling events leading to crowds; Community involvement to encourage acceptance and participation in these interventions; and environmental measures such as cleaning contact surfaces. More drastic measures to contain the outbreak were taken in China when the severity of the outbreak became clear.
Other countries have taken various measures to limit the spread of the virus.
South Korea, for example, has introduced mass screening and localized quarantines.
In Singapore, the infected received financial support when they self-quarantine, and for those who did not, severe fines were imposed.
In Taiwan, there has been an increase in the production of face masks and those who stockpile medical supplies have been punished. Simulations conducted in the UK and the US show that reduction (the slowing of the rate of infection, without stopping the spread of the epidemic) and suppression (i.e. reversing the growth of the epidemic) present major challenges.
Ideal policies of reduction could reduce the spike in demand for health services by two thirds and deaths by half, yet it would result in hundreds of thousands of deaths while overloading health systems.
Suppression may be the best alternative, but it needs to be maintained as long as the virus is circulating through the human population or until a vaccine is available if it happens before.
A long-term intervention to suppress the pandemic entails social and economic costs.
There is no approved antiviral drug that is specific to COVID-19. However, there are efforts towards developing medicines, which include testing existing medicines.
Using cold medications that do not require a prescription, drinking plenty of fluid, and resting may help to relieve symptoms.
Depending on the severity of the case, oxygen therapy, intravenous fluid insertion or respiratory aid may be necessary.
Steroid use may make the condition worse.
Several compounds previously approved to treat other viral diseases are under investigation for use in the treatment of COVID-19.
The World Health Organization also stated that some "domestic and traditional" medicines may alleviate symptoms caused by the SARS-CoV-19 virus.
WHO describes increasing capacity and adapting healthcare to the needs brought about by COVID-19 as key measures to combat the outbreak.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, ECDC, and the WHO office in Europe have issued guidance for hospitals and primary healthcare services to move their resources at various levels, including the concentration of laboratory services for COVID-19 testing, the cancellation of non-mandatory procedures and the separation and isolation of patients who have tested positive for COVID-19, as well as the increase of intensive care capacities through staff training and the increase in the number of beds and ventilators available.
There are several theories about the emergence of the first case (the so-called patient zero).
The first known case of the new coronavirus is dated December 1, 2019, in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China.
In a month, the number of coronavirus cases in the region has gradually increased.
These cases were largely linked to the wholesale market of Huanan seafood. The market also sold live animals, which led to the theory that the virus came from one of these animals. In other words, it was believed that it had a zoonotic origin.
On December 30, a group of doctors at Wuhan Central Hospital warned their colleagues about a "SARS-type coronavirus".
Eight of these doctors, including Li Wenliang, were reprimanded by the police for spreading false news. Another doctor, Ai Fen, was reprimanded by his superiors for giving the alarm.
The Wuhan Municipal Health Commission on December 31 issued a statement to the population and informed WHO.
Enough cases of pneumonia of unknown origin had already been reported to Wuhan health authorities to generate an investigation in early January. During the early stages of the outbreak, the number of cases doubled every seven and a half days, approximately.
In early and mid-January 2020, the virus spread to other provinces in China, facilitated by the Chinese New Year migration and the fact that Wuhan is a transportation hub as well as a major railway connection point.

WHO noted the contrast between the 2002-04 SARS outbreak, where Chinese authorities were accused of omitting data that made prevention and containment efforts difficult, and the current crisis, where the central government "provided regular updates to avoid the near-coming lunar new year holiday panic".
On 23 January, in reaction to the decision of the top authorities to implement a transport ban in Wuhan, WHO representative Gauden Galea noted that "that was certainly not a WHO recommendation" and was also "a very important indication of the commitment to contain the epidemic in the area where it was most concentrated". On 30 January, following confirmation of human transmission outside China and the increase in the number of cases in other countries, WHO declared the outbreak as an International Public Health Emergency (PHEIC), the sixth PHEIC since the measure was first invoked during the 2009 swine flu pandemic.
WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom said PHEIC was invoked because of the "risk of global spread, especially in low- and middle-income countries without robust health systems.
In response to the implementation of travel restrictions, Tedros stated that "there is no reason for measures that unnecessarily interfere with international travel and trade" and that "WHO does not recommend limiting trade and travel".

This virus may be on the way and you need to be ready", insisting that the right response measures could help the world avoid "the worst".
Ryan also stated that current data did not authorize public health officials to declare a global pandemic, saying such a statement would mean that "we are essentially accepting that every human on the planet will be exposed to this virus".
On March 11, the WHO declared the outbreak of coronavirus a pandemic.
The Director-General said that WHO was "deeply concerned about the alarming levels of spread and severity, and the alarming levels of inaction".

The Chinese government has been criticized by the United States, the UK Cabinet Minister Michael Gove, and the son of Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, Eduardo Bolsonaro for managing the pandemic, which began in the Chinese province of Hubei.
Provincial-level administrators of the Communist Party of China (CPC) were dismissed because of their approach to quarantine efforts in Central China, a sign of discontent with the political establishment's response to the outbreak in these regions.
Some commentators believe that this action was intended to protect Chinese Communist Party General Secretary Xi Jinping from public anger over the coronavirus outbreak.
Some Chinese officials, such as Zhao Lijian, rejected early recognition of the coronavirus outbreak that started in Wuhan, favoring conspiracy theories about COVID-19 originating in the US or Italy.
The US administration of Donald Trump referred to the coronavirus as the "Chinese virus" or "Wuhan virus" saying that China's censorship "overfed a virus that has now become a global pandemic", which was in turn condemned by some critics as racism and "a way to deflect the administration's failure to contain the disease".
The Daily Beast obtained from a U.S. government cable a detailed communication strategy with apparent origins in the National Security Council, with a strategy being cited as "It's all about China.
It was advised that we try and get these messages in any way, including press conferences and television appearances. "Channels like Politico, Foreign Policy and Bloomberg have indicated that China's efforts to send aid to countries affected by the virus are part of a propaganda for global influence.
The European Union's foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, warned that there is "a geopolitical component including a struggle for influence through a biased viewpoint and 'generous policies'.
Borrell also said that "China is aggressively spreading the message that, unlike the United States, it is a responsible and reliable partner".
China also asked the United States to lift its sanctions on Syria, Venezuela and Iran while allegedly sending aid to those same countries.

This is certainly not a good sign of European solidarity.'
On March 22, after a phone call with Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, Russian President Vladimir Putin prepared the Russian military army to send military doctors, special disinfectant vehicles, and other medical equipment to Italy.
The Italian newspaper La Stampa quoted an anonymous "high-level political source" as saying that 80 percent of Russia's supplies were "useless or of little use to Italy".
The source accused Russia of embarking on a "geopolitical and diplomatic" offensive.
The President of the Lombardy region, Attilio Fontana, and the Italian Foreign Minister, Luigi Di Maio, have waived media reports and expressed their gratitude.
Russia also sent a cargo plane with medical supplies to the United States.
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said that "in offering assistance to fellow Americans, [Putin] assumes that when American manufacturers of medical equipment and materials are in a good state, they would also act reciprocally if necessary".
The planned NATO military exercise 'Defender 2020' in Germany, Poland and the Baltic States, the largest NATO military exercise since the end of the Cold War, will be kept on a reduced scale.
Secretary General for the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament Kate Hudson criticized the Defender 2020 exercise: "In the current public health crisis, this puts at risk the lives not only of the troops of the United States and the various European countries that are participating, but of the inhabitants of the countries in which they operate". The Iranian government has been heavily affected by the virus, with about a dozen members of parliament infected, as well as fifteen current or former political figures.
President Hassan Rouhani of Iran wrote a public letter to world leaders asking for help on March 14, 2020, saying that his country is struggling to combat the outbreak due to lack of access to international markets as a result of US sanctions against Iran. The outbreak has led the United States to adopt common social policies in other developed countries, including universal health care, universal child care, paid family leave, and high levels of public health funding.
Political analysts predicted that this could negatively affect Donald Trump's chances of being re-elected as president in the 2020 election. Diplomatic relations between Japan and South Korea have worsened due to the pandemic.
South Korea has criticized Japan's ambiguous and passive quarantine efforts after Japan announced that anyone coming from South Korea would be put into a two-week quarantine at government designated locations.
South Korean society was initially polarized about President Moon Jae-in's response to the crisis.
Many Koreans have signed petitions calling for Moon's impeachment in what they called inadequate management of the outbreak, or praising his response.
Some commentators expressed concern that this could allow governments to strengthen their control over power.
In Hungary, the parliament voted to allow Prime Minister Viktor Orbán to rule by decree indefinitely, suspend parliament as well as elections and punish those deemed to have spread false news about the virus and the government's handling of the crisis.
The outbreak of Coronavirus has been blamed on several cases of supply shortages, resulting from the increased use of equipment globally to combat outbreaks, panic-driven purchases, and disruption of factory and logistics operations.
The United States Food and Administration has issued warnings about shortages of medicines and medical equipment due to increased consumption and supplier interruptions.
Several locals also experienced panic-driven shopping events that led to empty shelves of essential products such as food, toilet paper, bottled water, including shortages of supplies.
The technology industry in particular has been warned of delays in shipping electronic products.
According to WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom, the demand for personal protective equipment has increased 100 times.
This demand led to an increase in prices up to twenty times the normal price and also led to delays in the supply of medical supplies for four to six months.
This has also caused a shortage of personal protective equipment worldwide, with the WHO warning that this would put workers' health at risk.
In Australia, the pandemic has provided a new opportunity for Chinese buyers, daigou, to sell Australian products in China.
The activity created a shortage of baby formulas in some supermarkets and was subsequently banned by the Australian government. Despite the high prevalence of COVID-19 cases in northern Italy and the Wuhan region, and the consequent high demand for food products, both areas were spared a severe shortage of food.
Measures taken by China and Italy against the illegal storage and trade of essential products have been successful in avoiding the acute food shortages that were expected in Europe as well as North America.
Northern Italy with its significant agricultural production did not see a major decrease, but prices may increase according to industry representatives.
Empty food shelves were only found temporarily, even in the city of Wuhan, and Chinese government officials released pork reserves to ensure sufficient food for the population.
Similar laws exist in Italy requiring food producers to keep reserves for such emergencies.
A damage to the global economy was felt in China: according to a media report on March 16, the economy in China was badly hit in the first two months of 2020 due to government measures to curb the spread of the virus, and retail sales fell 20.5%.
As mainland China is a major economy and manufacturing hub, the viral outbreak has been seen as a major destabilizing threat to the global economy.
Agathe Demarais of the Economist Intelligence Unit predicted that markets would remain volatile until a clearer picture emerged of possible outcomes.
In January 2020, some analysts estimated that the economic impact of the epidemic on global growth could outweigh the 2002-04 SARS outbreak.
An estimate by an expert at Washington University in St. Louis indicated a $300 billion impact on the world's supply chain that could last up to two years.
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) reportedly 'confused' itself after a sharp drop in oil prices due to low demand from China.
Global stock markets fell on February 24 due to a significant increase in the number of COVID-19 cases outside Mainland China.

All three other indexes ended the week at a low of more than 10%.
On 28 February, Scope Ratings GmbH claimed China's sovereign credit rating but maintained a negative outlook.
Stocks fell again based on concerns about the coronavirus, the biggest drop on March 16.
Many consider a likely economic downturn.
Economist Mohamed El-Erian praised the state and central banks' timely emergency measures.
Central banks are reacting faster than they did to the 2008 financial collapse.
Tourism is one of the most affected sectors due to travel restrictions, closure of public places including tourist spots, and the recommendation of governments against any travel around the world.
As a result, many airlines cancelled their flights due to low demand, including British Airways, China Eastern Airlines, and Qantas, while British regional airline Flybe collapsed.
The impact on the cruise industry was unprecedented.
Several train stations and ferry ports were also closed.
The epidemic coincided with Chunyun, a major travel destination associated with the Chinese New Year holiday.
Several events involving large crowds have been cancelled by national and regional governments, including the annual New Year's festivals, with private companies also independently closing their stores and tourist attractions such as Disneyland in Hong Kong and Shanghai.
Many Lunar New Year events and tourist attractions have been closed to avoid mass crowds, including the Forbidden City in Beijing and traditional temple events.
In 24 of China's 31 provinces, municipalities and regions, authorities have extended the New Year holiday to February 10, instructing most workplaces not to reopen by that date.
These regions accounted for 80% of the country's GDP and 90% of exports.
Hong Kong has raised its level of response to the infectious disease to the highest level and declared a state of emergency, closing schools until March and cancelling its New Year celebrations.
Retail visits in Europe and Latin America fell by 40%.
Retailers in North America and the Middle East saw a 50-60% drop.
This also resulted in a 33-43% drop in pedestrian traffic to shopping centres in March compared to February.
Shopping center operators around the world have imposed additional measures such as increased cleaning, installation of thermal scanners to check the temperature of shoppers, and cancellation of events. According to the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America, it is estimated that the pandemic-induced recession could leave between 14 and 22 million more people in extreme poverty in Latin America than would have happened in situations without the pandemic.
In January and February 2020, during the height of the Wuhan epidemic, about 5 million people in China lost their jobs.
Many of China's 300 million migrant rural workers were left at home in inland provinces or trapped in Hubei province. In March 2020, more than 10 million Americans lost their jobs and sought government assistance.
The coronavirus outbreak could cost 47 million jobs in the United States and the unemployment rate could reach 32%, according to estimates by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. Confinement in India left tens of millions of Indian migrant workers (who are paid through daily pay) unemployed. A survey by the Angus Reid Institute found that 44% of Canadian families have gone through some form of unemployment.
During the second half of March, 4 million French workers applied for unemployment assistance and 1 million British workers applied for a universal credit scheme.
The German reduced-hour wage programme was adopted by France and Britain.
The performing arts and cultural heritage sectors have been deeply affected by the pandemic, affecting the operations of organisations as well as people - both employed and self-employed - worldwide.
Arts and culture organisations have tried to maintain their mission (often publicly funded) to provide access to cultural heritage for the community, maintain the safety of their staff and the public, and help artists wherever possible.
In March 2020, around the world and at various levels, museums, bookstores, performance venues, and other cultural institutions were closed indefinitely with their exhibitions, events, and performances cancelled or postponed.
In response, intensive efforts have been made to provide alternative services through digital platforms. Another recent and rapidly accelerating impact of the disease is the cancellation of religious services, major sporting events, and other social events such as music festivals and concerts, technology conferences, and fashion events.
The Vatican announced that the Holy Week rites in Rome, which would take place during the last week of the Christian Lent period, had been canceled.
Many dioceses have recommended that older Christians stay home rather than attend Sunday services; some churches have made church services available via radio, online live streaming or television while others offer drive-in-style services.
With the Roman Catholic Diocese closing its churches and chapels and St. Peter's Square empty without Christian pilgrims, other religious bodies also canceled services and limited public crowds in churches, mosques, synagogues, temples, and gurdwaras.
Iran's Ministry of Health announced the cancellation of Friday prayers in areas affected by the outbreak and shrines were subsequently closed, while Saudi Arabia banned entry of foreign pilgrims as well as their residents to holy sites in Mecca and Medina.
The pandemic has caused the most significant disruption in the world sports calendar since World War II.
Most major events have been cancelled or postponed, including the 2019-2020 UEFA Champions League, the 2019-2020 Premier League, the 2019-2020 NBA season, and the 2019-2020 NHL season.
The outbreak interfered with plans for the 2020 Summer Olympics, originally scheduled to begin in late July; the International Olympic Committee announced on 24 March that the event would be "rescheduled to a date after 2020, but not later than the summer of 2021".[4] Casinos and other gaming venues around the world have been closed and in-person poker tournaments have also been postponed or canceled.
This led many players to play online, with several online gaming sites reporting significant increases in their new sign-up rates. The entertainment industry was also affected, with several music groups suspending or cancelling their tours.
Many major theaters like Broadway also canceled all shows.
Some artists have explored ways to continue producing and sharing their work online as an alternative to traditional live performances, such as live-streamed concerts or creating online "festivals" for artists to present, share and publicize their work.
Online, various memes on the internet about the coronavirus are spreading as many seek humor and entertainment amid uncertainty.
Since the outbreak of COVID-19, there has been an increase in prejudice, xenophobia and racism against people of Chinese or East Asian descent, and against people in the focus areas of Europe, the United States and other countries.
Incidents of fear, distrust, and hostility have been observed in many countries, especially in Europe, East Asia, North America, and the Asia-Pacific region.
February results (when most cases were still restricted to China) recorded racist feelings expressed in various groups around the world about the Chinese people deserving the virus or being given a fair punishment for what they caused.
Some African countries have also identified an increase in anti-Chinese sentiment.
Many residents of Wuhan and Hubei reported discrimination based on their regional origin.
This has been supported by Chinese, both online and offline, and is targeted at those in the areas affected by the virus.
Following the outbreak's advance in new target countries, citizens of Italy, the first country in Europe to experience a severe COVID-19 outbreak, could also be subject to mistrust and xenophobia.
In Japan, the hashtag #ChineseDontComeToJapan went to Twitter's Trending Topics.
The Chinese people, as well as other Asians in the UK and the US, have reported increasing levels of racist insults as well as attacks.
US President Donald Trump has come under fire for referring to the coronavirus as the "Chinese virus", a term considered by critics to be racist and anti-Chinese.
Protesters in Ukraine attacked buses carrying evacuated Ukrainians and foreigners from Wuhan to Novi Sanzhary.
Students from northeast India, which borders China, and students in major Indian cities have reportedly suffered persecution related to the coronavirus outbreak.
The head of the Bharatiya Janata Party's state unit in West Bengal, Dilip Ghosh, said the Chinese have destroyed nature and "that is why God turned against them".
The comments were later condemned by the Chinese consulate in Calcutta, which called them "wrong". In China, xenophobia and racism against non-Chinese residents were ignited by the pandemic, with foreigners being called "foreign garbage" and targets of "disposal".
Many paid-access newspapers have removed them from some or all of the coronavirus coverage.
Several scientific publishers have made scientific articles related to the outbreak available to open access.
Some scientists have chosen to share their findings as soon as possible on preprint servers, such as bioRxiv.

Laboratory analyses for 2019 coronavirus respiratory disease (COVID-19) and associated SARS-CoV-2 virus include methods that detect the presence of the virus and those that detect antibodies produced in response to infection.
The presence of the virus in samples is confirmed by RT-PCR, which detects the RNA of the coronavirus.
This test is specific and developed solely to detect the RNA of the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
It is used to confirm very recent or active infections.
Antibody detection (sorology) can be used for population diagnosis and monitoring.
Antibody tests reveal how many people have had the disease, including those whose symptoms were too mild to report or who have become asymptomatic.
An accurate rate of disease mortality and herd immunity level in the population can be determined from the results of this test.
Due to limited testing, as of March 2020 no country had reliable data on the prevalence of the virus in its population.
As of 23 March, no country had tested more than 3% of its population, and there are considerable variations in the number of tests performed in the countries.
This variability is likely to still substantially affect the mortality rates of registered cases, which may be significantly overestimated in some countries.
Using real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR), the test may be performed on respiratory samples obtained by various methods, including nasopharyngeal rubbing or saliva sample.
Results are usually available within a few hours or 2 days.
The RT-PCR test performed with pharyngeal rubbing is reliable only in the first week of disease.
Later, the virus can disappear in the throat while it continues to multiply in the lungs.
For infected persons tested in the second week, as an alternative, the sample material may be removed from the bottom of the airways by suction catheter or excretion material (secretion) may be used.
One of the first PCR tests was developed at Charité, Berlin, in January 2020 using the real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR), and serves as the basis for 250,000 kits for distribution by the World Health Organization (WHO).
The UK also developed a test on 23 January 2020. South Korean company Kogenebiotech developed a clinical type, a PCR-based SARS-CoV-2 detection kit (PowerCheck Coronavirus) on 28 January 2020.
It searches for the "E" gene shared by all coronaviruses beta, and the SARS-CoV-2 specific RdRp gene. In China, the BGI group was one of the first companies to receive emergency use approval from the National Medical Products Administration of China for the PCR-based SARS-CoV-2 detection kit. In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is distributing its innovative RT-PCR Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) diagnostic dashboard in real time to public health labs by International Reagent Resource.
One of the three genetic tests in older versions of test kits generated inconclusive testing for faulty reagents, and an impediment to testing at the CDC in Atlanta; this resulted in an average of less than 100 samples per day being successfully processed throughout the month of February 2020.
Tests using two components were not considered reliable until 28 February 2020, and only after that were local and state laboratories authorised to start testing.
The test was approved by the Food and Drug Administration under an emergency use authorization.
As of March 5, 2020, LabCorp announced the national availability of RT-PCR-based COVID-19 testing.
Quest Diagnostics also made testing for COVID-19 nationally available from March 9, 2020.
No quantity restriction has been announced; collection and processing of samples must be carried out in accordance with the requirements of the CDC.
In Russia, the test for COVID-19 was developed and produced by the State Research Center in Virology and Biotechnology, VECTOR.
On February 11, 2020, the test was registered by the Federal Health Service. On March 12, 2020, the Mayo Clinic claimed to have developed a test to detect COVID-19 infection. On March 13, 2020, Roche Diagnostics received FDA approval for a test that could be performed within 3.5 hours on a large scale, thus allowing a machine to process approximately 4,128 tests in a 24-hour period.
On March 19, 2020, the FDA issued an Emergency Use Authorization (USA) for Abbott Laboratories for a test on Abbott's m2000 system; the FDA previously issued an authorization for Hologic, LabCorp, and Thermo Fisher Scientific.
On March 21, 2020, Cepheid also received a US FDA test for a test that takes about 45 minutes.
The FDA has approved a test that uses isothermic nucleic acid amplification technology instead of PCR.
Since it does not require a series of alternating temperature cycles, this method can produce positive results in just five minutes and negative results in 13 minutes.
There are currently about 18,000 of these machines in the U.S. and Abbott expects to increase production to provide 50,000 tests per day. A test that uses a monoclonal antibody and binds it in a particular way to the nucleocapsid protein (N protein) of the new coronavirus is being developed in Taiwan, with an expectation to provide results in 15 to 20 minutes such as a fast flu test.
A literature review in March 2020 concluded that "thorax x-rays have a lower diagnostic value in the early stages, while CT, computed tomography, findings may be present even before symptoms appear".
Typical characteristics in TC include bilateral multilobar opacities in dark glass with a posterior, peripheral and asymmetrical distribution.
Subpleural dominance, mosaic paving and consolidation evolve as the disease progresses.
A study comparing PCR to CT in Wuhan at the point of origin of the current pandemic suggested that CT is significantly more sensitive than PCR, although less specific, with many of its imaging aspects coinciding with other pneumonia and pathological processes.
As of March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommends that "TC should not be used for screening or as a first-line test to diagnose COVID-19".
Part of the immune response to infection is the production of antibodies including IgM and IgG.
These can be used to detect infection in individuals initiated 7 days or shortly after symptoms occur, to determine immunity, and in population monitoring.
High-productivity automated systems in many clinical laboratories will be able to perform these tests, but their availability will depend on the rate of production of each system.
For CLT, a single peripheral blood sample is commonly used, although numerous samples can be used to monitor the immune response.
For PoCT, a single blood sample is usually obtained by skin puncture.
Unlike PCR methods, the pre-test collection stage is not required. On March 26, 2020, the FDA indicated 29 entities that notified the agency as required, and are now fit to distribute their antibody tests.
As of April 7, 2020, only one test has been approved by the FDA with an emergency use authorization. In late March 2020, Euroimmun Medical Laboratory Diagnostics and Epitope Diagnostics received European approvals for their test kits, which can detect IgG and IgA antibodies to the virus in blood samples.
The testing capacity is several hundred samples in a matter of hours and therefore much faster than conventional viral RNA PCR tests.
Antibodies are usually detected 14 days after infection begins.In early April, the UK considered that none of the antibody test kits acquired were suitable enough to be used.
Hong Kong has set up a system in which suspected patients can stay at home, "the emergency department will give a sample tube to the patient", they must expel saliva from the tube, send it back and get a result shortly after. The British NHS announced that it is coordinating a system to test for suspected cases at home, which eliminates the risk of a patient infecting others if they are in hospital or the need to disinfect an ambulance if any is used.
Drive-thru centers have helped South Korea to conduct some of the fastest and most comprehensive tests in a country. In Germany, the National Association of Medical Registered Health Insurance Professionals said on March 2 that it had the capacity for about 12,000 tests per day in outpatient care, with 10,700 being tested the week before.
Costs are covered by health insurance when the test is requested by a doctor.
According to Robert Koch, president of the Institute, Germany has a total capacity of 160,000 tests per week.
Since March 19, drive-in testing has been offered in several major cities.
As of 26 March 2020, the total number of tests carried out in Germany remains unknown, as only positive tests are recorded.
The first research lab revealed that from the 12th week of 2020 a total of at least 483,295 samples were tested through the 12th week of 2020 and 33,491 samples (6.9%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. In Israel, researchers from the Technion and Rambam hospitals developed and tested a method to test samples from 64 patients simultaneously, collecting samples and performing additional tests only if the combined sample was considered positive. In Wuhan, a 2,000 m2 improvised emergency detection laboratory called "Huo-Yan" (Chinese: 火眼, or "Fire Eye" in English) was opened on 5 February 2020 by BGI, which can process more than 10,000 samples per day.
With construction overseen by BGI founder Wang Jian and taking 5 days, modeling revealed that cases in Hubei would have been 47% higher and the corresponding cost of dealing with quarantine would have doubled if this testing capacity had no online access.
The Wuhan lab was promptly followed by Huo-Yan labs in Shenzhen, Tianjin, Beijing, and Shanghai, in a total of 12 cities across China.
On March 4, 2020, the total daily rate of testing was 50,000 tests per day. Open source multiplex models released by Origami Assays were released as capable of testing up to 1,122 patient samples for COVID-19, using only 93 trials. These balanced models can be run in small labs without the need for robotic fluid handlers.
In March, scarcity or insufficient quantities of reagent became an obstacle to mass testing in the European Union, the United Kingdom and the USA.
This led some authors to study sample preparation protocols that involve heating samples to 98 °C (208 °F) for 5 minutes to release RNA genomes for additional testing. On March 31, it was reported that the UAE is now doing more per capita testing in its population for the Coronavirus than other countries, and would be on track to increase the level of testing and reach the majority of the population.
This was due to a combination of drive-thru capacity, and the acquisition of a population-scale mass processing laboratory by Group 42 and BGI (inspired by its Huo-Yan Emergency Detection Laboratories in China).
Built in 14 days, the lab is capable of conducting tens of thousands of RT-PCR tests per day and is the first in the world of this scale to operate outside of China.
Different testing methods targeting different components of the coronavirus genetic profile have been developed in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan and the United States.
The World Health Organization has adopted the German method for manufacturing kits sent to low-income countries that do not have the resources to develop their own.
The German method was released on 17 January 2020; the protocol developed by the US Centers for Disease Control was not available until 28 January, there was a delay in testing made available to the US and China and the US faced problems with the reliability of test kits well into the outbreak, furthermore, these countries alongside Australia were unable to provide enough kits to meet the demand and recommendations for testing made by healthcare professionals.
In contrast, experts claim that South Korea's wide availability for testing has helped reduce the spread of the new coronavirus.
Testing capacity, largely in private sector laboratories, has been consolidated over many years by the South Korean government.
On March 16, the World Health Organization indicated that strengthening testing programs as the best way to slow the progress of the COVID-19 pandemic. The high demand for testing due to the widespread spread of the virus has caused the delay of hundreds of thousands of tests in private U.S. laboratories, and the supply of cotton pads and chemical reagents has been affected.
In March 2020, China accurately reported problems in its test kits.
In the United States, the test kits developed by the CDC showed "faults"; the government then removed the bureaucratic barriers that prevented private testing.
The company explained that the incorrect results could be the result of a failure to collect samples or incorrect use of the kits.
The Spanish minister stated that he would cancel the kits that generated incorrect results and replace them with a different testing kit provided by Shenzhen Bioeasy. 80% of the test kits that the Czech Republic purchased from China generated incorrect results.
Prime Minister Matovic suggested that they be discarded in the Danube. Ates Kara of the Turkish Ministry of Health said that the Turkish test kits purchased from China had a "high error rate" and that he would not "use them".
The testing, followed by quarantine of those who tested positive and monitoring of those with whom people who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 came into contact, had positive results.
Researchers working in the Italian city of Vò, the site of the first COVID-19 death in Italy, conducted two phases of testing of the entire population of approximately 3,400 people, with an interval of about ten days.
About half of the people who tested positive had no symptoms, and all the cases found were quarantined.
With the move to the commune restricted, this eliminated new infections completely.
With aggressive contact monitoring, travel restrictions to the country, testing and quarantine, the 2020 coronavirus pandemic in Singapore has progressed much slower than in other developed countries, and without radical restrictions such as the mandatory closure of restaurants and retail establishments.
Many events were canceled, and Singapore began seriously advising residents to stay home on March 28, but schools reopened within schedule after the March 23 holidays.
Many other countries have also managed the pandemic with aggressive contact monitoring, travel restrictions to the country, testing and quarantine, but with less aggressive lockdowns, such as Iceland and South Korea.
A statistical study identified that the countries that conducted the most tests, relative to the number of deaths, had the lowest mortality rates, probably because those countries are more able to detect those with no or little symptoms.
WHO recommends that countries that do not have testing capacity and have national laboratories with limited COVID-19 experience send their first five positive samples and the first ten negative samples to one of the 16 WHO reference laboratories for confirmatory testing.
Of the 16 reference laboratories, 7 are in Asia, 5 in Europe, 2 in Africa, 1 in North America and 1 in Australia.
In the following table, the column 'Positive in % of tests' is influenced by the country testing policy.
A country that tests only people in hospitals will have a higher percentage of positive tests than a country that has tested all citizens, whether they have symptoms or not, the other characteristics are equivalent.
Hand washing (or hand cleaning), also known as hand hygiene, is the act of washing hands in order to remove dirt, fat, microorganisms, or other unwanted substances.
Washing hands with soap constantly at certain 'critical times' during the day prevents the spread of many diseases, such as diarrhea and cholera, which are transmitted by the fecal route.
People can also become infected with respiratory diseases such as the flu or a common cold, for example, if they do not wash their hands before touching their eyes, nose or mouth (i.e. mucous membranes).
The five crucial moments during the day when washing hands with soap is important include: before and after defecation, after cleaning the baby's bumbum or changing diapers, before feeding a child, before meals and before and after preparing food or handling raw meat, fish or fish.
If soap and water are not available, you can wash your hands with ash.
Before, during and after preparing food.
Before and after taking care of a sick person.
After changing diapers or cleaning a child who used the bathroom.
After you blow your nose, cough or sneeze.
After touching animal, feed or animal waste.
Clinical hand hygiene refers to hygiene practices related to medical procedures.
Washing hands before administering medicines or medical care can prevent or minimize the spread of disease.
The main purpose of hand washing is to cleanse the hands of pathogens (bacteria, viruses, or other microorganisms that can cause disease) and chemicals that can cause damage or disease.
This is particularly important for people who handle food or work in the medical field, but it is also an important practice for the general public.
Handwashing has many health benefits, including reducing the spread of influenza, coronavirus and other infectious diseases; preventing infectious causes of diarrhea; reducing respiratory infections;
And reducing the infant mortality rate in home births.
A 2013 study found that better handwashing practices can lead to small improvements in the growth of children under five years of age.
In developed countries, child mortality rates related to diarrhea and respiratory diseases can be reduced by simply introducing behavioural changes, such as washing hands with soap.
This simple approach can reduce the mortality rate of these diseases by almost 50%.
Hand-washing can reduce diarrhea by about a third, which is comparable to providing clean water to areas in need.
48% of the reductions in episodes of diarrhea can be associated with hand washing with soap. Hand washing with soap is the most effective and cost-effective way to prevent diarrhea and acute respiratory infections (AIRs), as automated behavior performed in homes, schools, and communities around the world.
Pneumonia, the primary cause of death among children under five, kills an estimated 1.8 million children a year.
Diarrhea and pneumonia together account for nearly 3.5 million child deaths annually.
According to UNICEF, making washing hands with soap before eating and after using the bathroom a deep-rooted habit can save more lives than any vaccine or medical intervention, reducing deaths from diarrhea by almost half and deaths from acute respiratory infections in a room.
Hand washing is usually associated with other health interventions as part of water, sanitation and hygiene facilities (WASH) programmes.
Hand washing also protects against the impetigo that is transmitted by direct physical contact.
A less significant negative effect of hand washing is that frequent hand washing can cause skin lesions due to dry skin.
A 2012 Danish study found that excessive hand washing can cause a skin condition known as eczema or hand dermatitis, which is particularly common among healthcare workers.
Frequent hand washing is also perceived as one of the symptoms of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD).
There are five crucial times during the day when washing hands with soap is important to reduce fecal-oral transmission of diseases: after using the toilet (micing, defecation), after cleaning a child's bumbum (switching diapers), before feeding a child, before eating and before/after preparing a food or handling raw meat, fish or chicken.
Other situations where the correct technique for hand washing must be practiced in order to prevent disease transmission include before and after treating a cut or injury; after sneezing, coughing or sneezing; after touching animal waste or handling animals; and after touching garbage.
In many countries, there is a reduced rate of handwashing with soap.
A study on handwashing in 54 countries in 2015 found that an average of 38.7% of households had a habit of washing their hands with soap. A 2014 study found that Saudi Arabia had the highest rate at 97 percent; the United States was close to the average at 77 percent; and China had the lowest rate at 23 percent. Various methods for behavior change currently exist to increase acceptance of the habit of washing hands with soap during critical periods. Collective handwashing for children in schools at certain times of the day is an alternative in developing countries to instilling handwashing into children's habits.
The "Essential Health Services Program" implemented by the Department of Education in the Philippines is an example of large-scale action to promote children's health and education.
Deparasitism twice a year, supplemented by daily hand washing with soap, daily flushing with fluoride, are at the heart of this national programme.
It has also been successfully implemented in Indonesia.
The removal of skin microorganisms is enhanced by adding soaps and detergents to water.
The main action of soaps and detergents is to reduce the barriers to solution and increase solubility.
Water alone is an ineffective cleaning agent for the skin, because fats and proteins, components of organic dirt, are not easily dissolved in water.
Cleaning is, however, facilitated by a reasonable flow of water...
Bar soap, because of its reusable nature, can retain bacteria accumulated from previous uses.
A small number of studies that looked at bacterial transmission from a contaminated bar soap concluded that transmission is unlikely since the bacteria are rinsed with foam.
The CDC reiterates "liquid soap with automatic dosage controls is preferable".
Antibacterial soaps have been widely disseminated to the health-conscious public.
There is no evidence so far that using recommended antiseptics or disinfectants may lead to the selection of antibiotic resistant organisms in the wild.
However, antibacterial soaps contain common antibacterial agents, such as triclosan, which has an extensive list of resistant strains of organisms.
So while antibiotic-resistant strains are not selected by antibacterial soaps, they may not be as effective as they are being promoted.
In addition to surfactants and skin-protective agents, complex formulas may contain acids (acetic acid, ascorbic acid, lactic acid) as a pH regulator, antimicrobial active benzoic acid, and other skin moisturizers (aloe vera, vitamins, menthol, plant extracts). A comprehensive analysis by the University of Oregon School of Public Health indicated that common soaps are as effective at preventing disease and removing bacteria from the hands as end-user-oriented antibacterial soaps containing triclosan.
Hot water that is comfortable for washing hands is not hot enough to kill bacteria.
The bacteria grow faster at body temperature (37 °C).
However, hot soap water is more effective than cold soap water at removing the natural oily matter that holds dirt and bacteria.
Contrary to popular belief, however, scientific studies have shown that using hot water is not effective in reducing the microbial load on the hands.
A hand sanitizer or antiseptic is a non-aquatic hand sanitizer.
In the late 1990s and early 21st century, non-alcoholic basic hand hygiene agents (also known as alcohol-based hand hygiene product, antiseptic hand hygiene product, or hand hygienist) are beginning to gain popularity.
Most are made from isopropyl alcohol or ethanol formulated with a thickening agent such as carbomere (polymer or acrylic acid), in gel, or a moisturizer such as glycerin, in liquid, or in foam to facilitate use and reduce the drying effect of alcohol.
Hand hygiene products containing at least 60 to 95 percent alcohol efficiently kill germs.
Alcohol-based hygiene agents kill bacteria, multi-resistant bacteria (MRSA and VRE), tuberculosis, and some viruses (including HIV, herpes, RSV, rhinovirus, vaccine, influenza and hepatitis) and fungi.
Alcohol-based hygiene products containing 70% alcohol kill 99.97% (reduction of 3.5 logarithms, similar to 35 decibels reduction) of bacteria in the hands 30 seconds after application and 99.99% to 99.999% (reduction of 4 to 5 logarithms) of bacteria in the hands 1 minute after application. Hand hygiene products are more effective against bacteria and less effective against some viruses.
Alcohol hand hygiene products are almost totally ineffective against norovirus (or Norwalk), the most common cause of contagious gastroenteritis.
The back and palms of the hands, between the fingers and the extremities, are rubbed for approximately 30 seconds until the liquid, foam or gel is dry.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends washing hands with hand hygiene agents, especially when hands are visually dirty.
The increasing use of these agents is based on their ease of use and rapid extermination against microorganisms; however, they should not replace adequate hand washing unless soap and water are not available.
Frequent use of alcohol-based hand hygiene products may cause dry skin unless skin emollients and/or moisturizers are added to the formula.
The drying effect of alcohol may be reduced or eliminated by the addition of glycerin and/or other emollients to the formula.
In clinical trials, alcohol-based hand hygiene products containing emollients caused substantially less irritation and dryness in the skin than soaps or antimicrobial detergents.
Allergic contact dermatitis, contact hives syndrome or hypersensitivity to alcohol or to additives present in alcohol-based hand hygiene products rarely occur.
The lower tendency to cause irritating contact dermatitis became attractive when compared to handwashing with soap and water.
Despite their effectiveness, non-aquatic agents do not clean hands with organic matter, only disinfect them.
That is why hand hygiene products are not as effective as soap and water in preventing the spread of many pathogens, since pathogens still remain in the hands.
The effectiveness of alcohol-free hand hygiene is highly dependent on substances and formulations, and historically has been far behind alcohol and alcohol-based hygiene.
More recently, formulations using benzalcone chloride have been shown to have continuous and cumulative antimicrobial action after application, unlike alcohol, which has been shown to have reduced efficacy after repeated use, probably due to increasing adverse reactions on the skin.
Many people in low-income communities cannot afford a soap and instead use ash or earth.
Ash or earth may be more effective than pure water, but they may be less effective than soap.
One concern is that if the earth or ash is contaminated with microorganisms, the spread of the disease may increase rather than decrease.
Like soap, gray is also a disinfectant, since it forms an alkaline solution when in contact with water.
The WHO recommends gray and sand as an alternative to soap when soap is not available.
The proper hand washing technique recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control to prevent disease transmission includes the following steps:
Wash your hands with cold or hot running water.
Current water is recommended as fixed washing machines may be contaminated while the water temperature does not appear to be relevant.
Rub your hands, rubbing them with a generous amount of soap, including the back of your hands, the space between your fingers and under your nails.
Soap removes germs from the skin, and studies show that people tend to wash their hands more carefully when using soap instead of pure water.
Rub for at least 20 seconds.
The act of rubbing causes friction, which helps remove germs from the skin, and rubbing for longer removes more germs.
Rinse well with running water.
Washing in a sink can re-contaminate your hands.
Dry with a dry towel or let it dry outdoors.
Wet or wet hands are more easily re-contaminated, and the most commonly forgotten areas are the thumb, wrist, the areas between the fingers and under the nails.
Artificial oils and peeled enamels can harbor microorganisms.
Moisturizing lotion is often recommended to keep your hands hydrated; dry skin can cause skin lesions that can increase the risk of infection transmission.
Several low-cost options can be made to facilitate hand washing where there is no running water and/or soap, for example pouring one gallon or well-drained water and/or using ash if necessary in developing countries. In situations with limited water supply (such as schools or rural areas in developing countries), there are solutions for water storage such as 'improvised turbines' and other low-cost options.
An improvised faucet is a simple technology that uses a jar suspended by a rope, and a foot-operated lever to pour a small amount of water into the hands and a bar of soap.
Effective hand drying is an essential part of the hand hygiene process, but there is debate about the most effective way to dry in public bathrooms.
A growing body of research suggests that towel sheets are far more hygienic than the electric hand dryers found in many bathrooms.
In 2008, a study was conducted by the University of Westminster, London, and sponsored by the towel paper industry, the European Tissue Symposium, to compare the hygiene levels presented by towel paper, heated air hand dryers and the most modern air jet hand dryers.
After washing and drying hands with a heated air dryer, the total number of bacteria was considered to be on average 194% higher in the palm area near the fingers and 254% higher in the rest of the palm.
Air jet drying has resulted in an increase in the total number of bacteria, on average, by 42% in the palm area near the fingers and by about 15% in the rest of the palm.
After washing and drying hands with towel paper, the total number of bacteria was reduced, on average, by up to 76% in the palm area near the fingers and up to 77% in the rest of the palm.
The airjet dryer, which projects air out of the unit at indicated speeds of 180 m/s (650 km/h; 400 mph), managed to expel microorganisms from the hands and unit potentially contaminating other bathroom users and the environment up to 2 metres away.
Using a hot-air hand dryer spreads microorganisms up to 0.25 meters from the dryer.
Towel paper did not show a significant spread of microorganisms. In a 2005 study conducted by TÜV Produkt and Umwelt, different methods for hand drying were evaluated.
The following changes in bacterial counts after hand drying were observed:
There are many different hand dryer manufacturers, and hand dryers have been compared to paper towel drying.
Hand washing with wet hand sanitizer wipes is an alternative to lack of soap and water during travel.
Alcohol-based hand sanitizers shall contain at least 60% alcohol.
Clinical hand washing became mandatory long after the Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis discovered its effectiveness (in 1846) in preventing disease in the hospital environment.
There are electronic devices that provide feedback to remind the hospital staff to wash their hands when they forget.
One study found that infection rates decreased with its use.
Clinical hand washing is for a minimum of 15 seconds, using generous amounts of soap and water or gel to soak and rub all parts of the hands.
The hands should be rubbed simultaneously with the fingers intertwined.
If there are residues under the nails, a brush can be used to remove them.
Since germs can remain in the water on your hands, it is important to rinse well and dry with a clean towel.
After drying, the towel paper should be used to close the faucet (and open the door if necessary).
This prevents hand contamination from these surfaces.
The purpose of hand washing in the healthcare environment is to remove pathogenic microorganisms ('germs') and prevent their transmission.
The New England Journal of Medicine reports that the lack of hand washing remains unacceptable in most medical settings, with a large number of doctors and nurses constantly forgetting to wash their hands before touching patients, thus transmitting microorganisms.
One study found that proper hand washing and other simple procedures can reduce the rate of catheter-related infections in the bloodstream by 66 percent.
The organisation's hand hygiene guidance project can also be found on this website for comments.
A relevant review was carried out by Whitby et al.
Commercial devices may measure and validate hand hygiene if demonstration of regulatory compliance is required.
The World Health Organization defines "five moments" for hand washing:
after exposure to body fluids/blood fluids
before an ascetic task, and
The addition of antiseptic chemicals to soap (medicinal or antimicrobial soaps) gives a destructive action to a handwashing agent.
Such exterminating action may be desirable before surgery or in situations where antibiotic-resistant organisms are prevalent. To "clean" hands for a surgical operation it is necessary to have a faucet that can be opened and closed without touching it with your hands, some chlorhexidine or iodine antiseptics, sterilized towels to dry hands after washing, and a sterilized brush for cleaning and other sterilized tools for cleaning under your nails.
All jewels must be removed.
This procedure requires washing of the hands and forearms to the elbows, usually for 2-6 minutes.
A very long cleaning time (10 minutes) is not necessary.
At the time of washing, the water in the forearms should not flow to the hands.
After the hand washing is completed, the hands are washed with a sterilized towel and the surgical robe is dressed.
To reduce the spread of germs, it is best to wash your hands or use an antiseptic before and after you treat a sick person.
For the control of staph infections in hospitals, there was a greater benefit of hand cleaning in the first 20% of washing, and a slightly significant additional benefit was obtained when the cleaning frequency exceeded 35%.
Comparing hand hygiene with an alcohol-based solution to hand washing with an antibacterial soap for an average of 30 seconds for each revealed that the alcohol-based hand sanitizer reduced bacterial contamination by 26% more than an antibacterial soap.
However, soap and water are more effective than alcohol-based hand hygiene agents to reduce influenza A, H1N1 virus, and Clostridium difficile spores on the hands. Interventions to increase hand hygiene in hospital settings may involve raising team awareness about hand washing, increasing availability of alcohol-based hand hygiene agents, and verbal and written warnings to the team.
More research is needed on which interventions are most effective in different healthcare settings.
In developing countries, soap hand washing is considered an economically viable essential tool for good health and even better nutrition.
However, the lack of reliable sources of water, soap or resources for hand washing in people's homes, schools and workplaces makes this a challenge for achieving the universal practice of hand washing.
For example, in most rural Africa handwashing faucets near any public or private bathrooms are rare, although there are cheap options for building handwashing stations.
However, low rates of handwashing may instead be the result of entrenched habits and not the absence of soap and water.
The promotion and defence of handwashing with soap can influence political decisions, lead to awareness of the benefits of handwashing and lead to a long-term change in the behaviour of the population.
For this to work effectively, monitoring and evaluation are necessary.
A systematic review of 70 studies found that community-based approaches are effective in increasing handwashing in low- and middle-income countries, while social marketing campaigns are less effective. An example of promoting handwashing in schools is UNICEF's "Three Star Approach" which encourages schools to take simple, inexpensive steps to ensure that students wash their hands with soap, among other hygiene requirements.
When a minimum level is reached, schools can go from one to the top three stars.
The construction of hand washing stations may be part of hand washing promotional campaigns aimed at reducing childhood disease and mortality.
World Handwashing Day is another example of an awareness campaign that attempts to achieve a change in habit. As a result of the 2019-2020 coronavirus pandemic, UNICEF has announced the adoption of a handwashing emoji.
Few studies have considered the overall cost/benefit ratio of handwashing in developing countries to the DALY rating.
However, one analysis suggests that promoting handwashing with soap is significantly more cost-effective than other water and sanitation interventions.
The importance of hand washing to human health  especially for people in vulnerable circumstances such as mothers who have just given birth or wounded soldiers in hospitals  was initially recognized in the mid-19th century by two forerunners of hand hygiene: the Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis who worked in Vienna, Austria, and Florence Nightingale, the English "founder of modern nursing".
At that time, people still believed that infections were caused by unpleasant odors called miasmas.
In the 1980's, foodborne outbreaks and health-care-related infections led the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to more actively encourage hand hygiene as an important way to prevent the spread of infections.
The 2009 swine flu outbreak and the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic have caused a rise in awareness in many countries about the importance of hand washing with soap to protect against such infectious diseases.
For example, posters with 'appropriate hand washing techniques' have been hung near hand washing sinks in public toilets and in bathrooms of office buildings and airports in Germany.
The expression "wash your hands" means to declare a reluctance to take responsibility or to be complicit in something.
It originates from the Bible passage in Matthew, where Pontius Pilate washed his hands of the decision to crucify Jesus Christ, but it has become a more general phrase in some English communities.
In Shakespeare's Macbeth, Lady Macbeth begins to compulsively wash her hands in an attempt to clear an imaginary stain, representing her guilty conscience in relation to the crimes she had committed and led her husband to commit.
It has also been found that people, after remembering or witnessing unethical acts, tend to wash their hands more often than others, and they tend to place more importance on handwashing equipment.
In addition, those who can wash their hands after such a vision are less likely to perform other compensatory acts of "cleaning", such as volunteering.
Symbolic hand washing, using water but not soap, to wash hands is part of a ritual hand wash characteristic of many religions, including the Bahá'í faith, Hinduism, tevilah and netilat yadayim in Judaism, washing in Christianity, and washing in Islam.
Hinduism, Judaism, and Islam allow for hand washing after using the toilet.
And Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, and Islam allow for hand washing before and after meals.
Workplace hazard controls for COVID-19
Workplace hazard controls for COVID-19 are the application of occupational health and safety methodologies to hazard controls for the prevention of the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
Adequate workplace hazard controls depend on the workplace and work itself, based on risk assessment of exposure sources, severity of the disease in the community, and individual worker risk factors that may be vulnerable to COVID-19 contraction.
According to the Department of Occupational Health and Safety (OSHA), lowest-risk occupations have minimal occupational contact with the public and other coworkers, for which basic infection prevention measures are recommended, including hand washing, encouraging employees to stay home if they are sick, maintaining a breathing label and a routine cleaning and disinfection of the work environment.
Functions with medium exposure risk include those that require frequent or direct contact with people who are not known to be infected or suspected of being infected with COVID-19, but may be infected due to current community transmission or by having travelled abroad.
This includes workers who maintain contact with the general public such as in schools, high population density work environments, and the large retail market.
Hazard controls for this group, in addition to basic infection prevention measures, include ventilation using high-efficiency air filters, protective coverings and provision of individual protection equipment if a person is confirmed with COVID-19.
OSHA considers that health and mortuary workers who are exposed to people with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 are at high risk of exposure, which increases the risk of exposure to very high if workers perform procedures on people with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 and collect or handle specimens of those people.
Hazard controls appropriate for such workers include engineering controls such as negative pressure ventilation rooms and personal protective equipment appropriate to the work performed.
The COVID-19 epidemic can have a number of effects in the workplace.
Workers may be absent from work because they are sick, because they have to care for others, or because they fear exposure.
Trade standards may change in terms of both the products in demand and the means of acquiring those products (such as shopping outside peak hours or for delivery or drive-thru services.
Finally, the sending of items from areas severely affected by COVID-19 can be stopped. An infectious disease action and preparedness plan can be used to guide protective actions.
The plans address the risk levels associated with various workplaces and tasks, including sources of exposure, risk factors that arise at home and in the community, and individual worker risk factors such as advanced age or chronic medical conditions.
They also define the controls necessary to address these risks, and contingency plans for situations that may arise as a result of epidemics.
Infectious disease action and preparedness plans may be subject to national or regional recommendations.
The objectives for action for an epidemic include reducing transmission between employees, protecting people at higher risk of developing health complications, maintaining business operations and minimising adverse effects on other entities in the supply chains.
The severity of the disease in the community where the company is located affects the actions taken.
The hierarchy of hazard controls is a widely used structure in occupational health and safety to group hazard controls by effectiveness.
When the dangers of COVID-19 cannot be eliminated, the most effective controls are engineering controls, followed by administrative controls and finally individual protective equipment.
Engineering controls involve isolating employees from work-related hazards without taking into account worker behavior, and may be the most cost-effective implementation solution.
Engineering controls are changes in labour policy or procedures that require action by the worker or employer.
Individual protective equipment (PPE) is considered less effective than engineering and administrative controls, but may help prevent certain exposures.
All types of PPE shall be selected based on the hazard to the worker, adjusted appropriately as needed (e.g. breathing apparatus), used appropriately and continuously, inspected regularly, preserved and replaced as needed, and removed, cleaned and stored or disposed appropriately to avoid contamination.
According to the U.S. Department of Health and Safety at Work (OSHA), low-risk jobs have minimal occupational contact with the public and other coworkers.
Basic infection prevention measures recommended for all workplaces include frequent and thorough hand washing, encouraging workers to stay home if they are sick and using the breathing label, including covering up sneezing and coughing, preparing dishwashers and common garbage, preparing for telework or step-by-step shifts, where necessary, discouraging the use of tools and equipment by other workers and maintaining a routine cleaning and disinfection of the work environment.
Rapid identification and isolation of potentially infected individuals is an essential step in protecting workers, customers, visitors and others in the workplace.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that employees who have symptoms of acute respiratory illness stay home until they have no fever, signs of fever, or any other symptoms for at least 24 hours without using medication to reduce fever or alleviate other symptoms, and also recommends that sick leave policies be flexible, allow employees to stay home to care for a sick family member, and that they have knowledge of these policies.
According to OSHA, jobs with average exposure risk include those that require frequent or direct contact of 6 feet (1.8 m) with people who are not known to be confirmed or suspected COVID-19 patients, but may be infected with SARS-CoV-2 due to current community transmission at the company location, or because the individual has a recent history of traveling abroad, in a country with high COVID-19 transmission.
These include workers who have contact with the general public such as in schools, high population density work environments and some high sales volume retail stores.Engineering controls for this group and for higher risk groups include the installation of high-efficiency air filters, increased ventilation, the installation of physical barriers such as transparent plastic hygienic outer shelves and the installation of a drive-thru window to serve customers.Administrative controls for this group and some high-risk retail stores include encouraging workers to stay at home, replacing face-to-face meetings with virtual communication, setting up staggered shifts, cancelling non-essential travel to local protective areas with ongoing COVID-19 epidemic development, risk management of COVID-19, communication plans, including a mask and other measures to protect workers from COVID-19, including providing personal protective equipment, and providing for the use of personal protective equipment, providing for the use of personal protective equipment, and providing for the use of personal protective equipment, providing for COVID-19 safety and security, and providing for workers with adequate and effective protection against COVID-19, and providing for workers with adequate and effective tools to prevent the use of COVID-19, including personal protective equipment, personal protective equipment and equipment, and other tools to limit the use of personal protective equipment, and equipment, including the use of personal protective equipment, and equipment for the use of personal protective equipment, and equipment, and providing for the use of personal protective equipment, including the use of personal protective equipment against COVID-19, and providing for the use of personal protective equipment, and for the use of personal protective equipment of personal protective equipment, and for the use of personal protective equipment of workers against COVID-19 exposed.
Workers in this risk group rarely need respirators.
If a person becomes ill on an aircraft, appropriate controls to protect workers and other passengers include isolating the sick person from other people for a distance of 6 feet, with the appointment of a crew member to serve the sick person and offer him a face mask, or having the sick person cover his mouth and nose with handkerchiefs when coughing or sneezing.
The crew shall wear disposable medical gloves when serving a sick passenger or touching potentially contaminated body fluids or surfaces and possibly additional personal protective equipment if the sick patient has a fever, persistent cough or difficulty breathing.
Gloves and other disposable items should be discarded in a bag for biologically hazardous waste, and contaminated surfaces should be cleaned and disinfected afterwards.For commercial transport, including cruise ships and other passenger vessels, hazard controls include delaying the journey by the sick passenger, self-isolation and immediate communication to the medical centre on board if someone develops fever or other symptoms during the journey.
Ideally, medical monitoring should take place in the isolation cabin of the person. For schools and child care centers, the CDC recommends temporary closure for cleaning and disinfection if an infected person was present in the building, regardless of the spread of the virus in the community.
When there is minimal to moderate community transmission, social distancing strategies can be implemented, such as cancelling field trips, assemblies, and other large groups such as physical education classes or coral reefs, or meals at a snack bar, increasing the space between tables, stricter arrival and departure times, limiting non-essential visitors, and using a separate health care facility for children with flu symptoms.
When there is significant transmission in the local community, in addition to social distancing strategies, extended school breaks may be considered. For law enforcement officials who perform daily activities, the immediate health risk is considered low by the CDC.
It is recommended that police officers who come into contact with individuals with suspected COVID-19 or confirmed illness follow the same guidelines as emergency medical technicians, including the use of appropriate personal protective equipment.
If direct contact occurs during seizure, workers shall clean and disinfect their belts and other accessories before re-using them using a household cleaner spray or cloth and follow standard operating procedures for the containment and disposal of used PPE and for the containment and washing of clothing.
OSHA considers certain health and mortuary workers to be in high or very high risk exposure categories.
High-risk exposure roles include medication delivery, medical care, laboratory and medical transportation workers who are exposed to patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19.
The risk of exposure becomes very high if workers perform aerosol generation procedures on patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19, or collect or handle specimens of these patients.
Aerosol generation procedures include intubation, cough induction procedures, bronchoscopy, some dental procedures and examinations or invasive specimen collection.
High-exposure necrosis work includes workers involved in preparing bodies of people with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 at the time of their death; the risk of exposure becomes too high if they perform autopsies. Additional engineering controls for these risk groups include isolation rooms for patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19, including when aerosol-generating procedures are performed.
Specialised negative pressure ventilation may be appropriate in some mortuary and health settings.
Species shall be handled with the precaution of level 3 biosecurity.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that patients admitted to hospital be separated into two distinct waiting areas depending on whether they are a suspected case for COVID-19. In addition to other EPIs, OSHA recommends respirators for professionals working within 6 feet of patients with confirmed or suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection, and for professionals performing aerosol generation procedures.
In the United States, NIOSH-approved N95 particle-filtered facial respirators or higher quality respirators should be used in the context of a comprehensive written respiratory protection program that includes adjustment testing, training and medical examinations.
Other types of respirators can provide protection and improve worker comfort. WHO does not recommend the use of macaques, since COVID-19 is a respiratory disease, and is not transmitted by non-respiratory body fluids.
WHO recommends only a surgical mask for screening staff at the entry point.
For professionals who collect respiratory specimens, treat or transport patients with COVID-19 without aerosol generation procedures, WHO recommends a surgical mask, protective or facial goggles, surgical apron and gloves.
If an aerosol generation procedure is performed, the surgical mask is replaced by an N95 or FFP2 respirator.
Given the insufficient global supply of EPIs, WHO recommends minimizing the need for EPIs through telemedicine, physical barriers such as clear windows, allowing only those involved in direct patient care to enter a room with a patient with COVID-19, using only the EPI needed for the specific task, continuous use of the same respirator without removing it while treating multiple patients with the same diagnosis, monitoring and coordinating the EPI supply chain, and discouraging the use of masks by asymptomatic individuals.

We're in unusual circumstances this month.
The COVID-19 epidemic is something that makes clear our global human interconnection and our responsibilities to one another.
Their challenges are unprecedented, but we know that our best actions go hand in hand with global empathy, cooperation and community building, which are the foundations of this organization.
The fellowship and concern we've seen among all our colleagues through emails, calls and conversations is a remarkable validation of the amazing human beings we've been privileged to work with.
I am so grateful and proud to have you all as coworkers.
Last week, someone shared with me their appreciation for our work.
This person reminded me of how significant it is for the world to have access to Wikipedia now, and how powerful it is that this essential resource remains online and available to everyone.
Your work makes this possible because you keep the workplaces active, you pay our coworkers, and you keep our communities safe.
The world needs the information that Wikipedia provides, more than ever.
This is a time when not only what we do, but the way we do it, will have a significant impact on the world.
Given the importance of this mission and its role in it, we will make important adjustments to the way we work together, starting next week.
Adjustments to our work and schedules
As Robyn mentioned earlier, Team C met last night to discuss our approach and schedules for the next few days and months.
At this meeting, we discussed what we think is an appropriate action for what we are experiencing and the best way to keep the organisation sustainable during this period.
We want to put a stop to stress and support our mission in the long run.
If you need to be away for a while, that's fine.
For all employees, service providers and contract workers:
Our daily work expectation will be 4 hours, or 20 hours a week, until otherwise provided.
We're not declaring a holiday, but if you can work on normal hours, you could be useful to our mission.
However, the world is unpredictable now, and if you need to care for loved ones, buy groceries, or go to the doctor, your well-being is our priority.
We're not monitoring your schedules.
If you're sick, don't work.
That rule wouldn't even need to be expressed, but we decided to declare it.
No certification or paid leave is required, just tell your manager to help your team review the schedule and schedules to ensure that key areas of work are met.
(If you are diagnosed with COVID-19, inform Bryan from the training and certification industry so that his industry can help you and ensure that your situation receives appropriate management attention).
The hourly staff will be paid in full.
We've said that before, and we're committed to honoring our commitment to our contractors and employees who work hourly.
Everyone will receive their wages based on their normal work record under normal circumstances.
Wages depend on whether you are sick and unable to work.
If you want to work, we're fully supportive of you.
Many people view work as a way to channel stress because of the current situation in the world.
The work we do can be incredibly rewarding, especially at times like these.
Remembering that your well-being is more important.
We just ask that you contact your manager so we know what to expect and can help the activities properly.
Some functions are considered essential.
There are activities we must continue to carry out.
The Site Reliability, HR, Reliability and Security and Fundraising Engineering teams (among others) are carrying out essential activities that may require additional support.
We'll begin a process with all departments to evaluate our current objectives and shift our focus to support what's essential to our mission.
There is much to be done for all of us, and we will focus our efforts on the most essential projects.
Slowing down now won't hurt us in the future.
We have no intention of "working doubly to make up for lost time" after the pandemic is over.
You will not be expected to work overtime to meet deadlines that are now impractical.
We accept that circumstances have changed, and we will work to set new targets and deadlines as appropriate.
What will happen to the annual planning?
To adjust to our new reality and expectations of hours worked per day, we intend to adjust the timetable for the delivery of our Annual Plan 2020-2021.
Our intention is to propose an extension of our 2019-2020 plan, which will provide more time for the budget, and that employees prioritize essential work, personal care and the care of loved ones, while accommodating those who need or want to work on a reduced work schedule in the coming weeks.
The extension of the schedule greatly reduces the current planning workload and the pressure throughout the organisation.
We'll present our proposal to the board next week and update the representatives and teams on the next steps as soon as we have confirmation.
We thank the annual planning team for their leadership in this process.
Office status, exposure and cleanliness
Last week, we learned that one of our colleagues in San Francisco may have been exposed to the COVID-19 virus.
In view of this situation, as a precaution, we have employed an antiviral cleaning team to disinfect all surfaces in the San Francisco office.
They used a special antiviral solution for hospitals to disinfect all surfaces as well as the lobby and all the elevators that give access to our floor.
The building is using its own protocol of duty of care using products that are safe for its occupants.
We are relieved that the office will be properly prepared for when we decide to return.
Our Washington office is located in a WeWork, which shared its COVID-19 protocol with us and all employees in Washington.
Last week, our Washington office moved to a fully remote setting, in line with the guide shared with San Francisco.
As some of our colleagues in New York know, we're also discussing renting an office in Brooklyn.
These discussions continue, but may be delayed.
Some of our colleagues are working remotely for the first time.
Our colleagues who have been working remotely for a long time know that this can be an adjustment, and they'd like to offer some advice:
Limit the duration of meetings to a maximum of one or two hours.
If longer sessions are needed, consider splitting them into several days.
Set the meeting, have a schedule, and send in advance reading material.
Use videos as the default, with tools like Google Docs and Zoom to facilitate collaboration and connection in real time.
Have a leader to facilitate meetings, someone to monitor chat questions and the list of participants, and someone to help you make notes (or collaborative notes).
Email technical support if you need comfortable headphones.
Use your emergency aid to buy snacks.
Join the #remoties channel to talk to your colleagues about remote work
The HR operations team is researching ergonomics guides in the context of the webinar to help increase remote work at the Foundation.
Last week, we asked all community aid recipients to cancel public events funded by Wikimedia, such as the editing marathons, until the WHO declares the end of the pandemic.
We warned you that we understood that our request for cancellation and other restrictions could make it impossible for you to complete your agreed grant activities, and that no one would be penalized for extending or modifying your goals.
Next week we will continue with additional guides on Wikimania and other regional and thematic conferences for the community.
The general feeling in the global community seems to be sadness about the shutdown, but also relief from the clarity and ability to keep the focus on their own communities, on Wikimedia and in other situations.
The communication resources team is working on creating a page on Meta-Wiki to provide a space for the community to monitor impact and receive our communications to it.
Staying updated on COVID-19 related matters
We will send an invitation to your calendar for next Thursday at 14:00 UTC/ 07:00 PT for a special meeting with the staff.
We'll use that time to share additional updates, answer your questions, and spend some time connecting with each other.
We're in this together and we'll help with whatever it takes.
In the meantime, you can continue to find the information of this email and all other COVID-19-related information on the company's wiki.
The communication resources team will update those pages and all information in one place.
We are also working to maintain regular communication with employees living in significantly affected countries at present.
If you have any questions about travel, events, a main workflow, or coverage challenge, or anything else you may need help with, be sure to notify them and work with the communication resources team.
We're here to help provide support and collaboration as needed.
If you have a confidential or sensitive matter, please email Bryan Judan, Director of Global Human Resources Operations.
None of these changes should be seen as a departure from our work and obligations.
They are, however, a recognition that at this moment our work and obligations will probably have to adapt in a way that we have not adapted to in the past.
These are the steps we believe are necessary as support at this time, so that we can continue to work, providing our movement with the support they need and providing the world with the service it depends on.
Our planned work will be waiting for us when the time comes.
For now, it is time to support each other and make room for the important work that will be done in the weeks and probably months ahead.
We need all of you to make this happen, so we need all of you to take care of yourself and your family so that you are in your best shape when needed.
Wash your hands and don't touch your face!

The angiotensin converting enzyme type 2 (ECA2) is an enzyme coupled to the outer surface (cell membranes) of cells of the lungs, arteries, heart, kidney, and intestines.
ECA2 neutralizes the activity of the related angiotensin converting enzyme (ECA) by reducing the amount of angiotensin II and raising Ang (1-7), making it a promising drug targeted for the treatment of cardiovascular disease. ECA2 also acts as a cell entry point for some coronaviruses.
The human version of the enzyme is often referred to as hECA2.
The angiotensin converting enzyme type 2 is a zinc-containing metal enzyme located on the surface of the endothelial and other cells.
The ECA2 protein contains an N-terminal M2 peptidase domain and a C-terminal domain that carries amino acids and colectin to the renal system.
ECA2 is a type 1 single-pass membrane protein with its enzymatically active domain exposed on the surface of cells in the lungs and other tissues.
The extracellular domain of ECA2 is cleaved from the transmembrane domain by another enzyme known as sheddase, and the resulting soluble protein is released into the bloodstream and eventually excreted in the urine.
ECA2 is present in many organs: ECA2 is coupled to the cell membrane of major type II pulmonary alveolar cells, small intestine enterocytes, arterial and venous endothelial cells, and smooth arterial muscle cells in most organs.
ECA2 mRNA expression is also found in the cerebral cortex, striated body, hypothalamus, and brainstem.
The main function of ECA2 is to act as a counterweight to ECA.
ECA cleaves the type I angiotensin hormone to type II angiotensin causing vasoconstriction.
ECA2 in turn adheres to carboxiterminal amino acid phenylalanine from angiotensin II (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe) and hydrolysis in the vasodilator angiotensin (1-7), (H-Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-Gist-Pro-OH).
ECA2 also binds several other peptides, including [des-Arg9]-bradicinine, apellin, neurotensin, dinorphine A, and ghrelin.
ECA2 also regulates membrane transport of neutral amino acid transporter SLC6A19 and has been implicated in Hartnup disease.
As a transmembrane protein, ECA2 functions as the main entry point into cells for some coronaviruses, including HCoV-NL63; SARS-CoV (the virus that causes SARS); and SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19).
More specifically, binding of the spike protein S1 of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 to the enzyme domain of ECA2 on the cell surface results in endocytosis and translocation of the virus and enzyme into endosomes located within cells.
This entry process also requires the preparation of the S protein by the host serine protease TMPRSS2, whose inhibition is under investigation as a potential therapy. This has led some to speculate that reducing ECA2 levels in cells may help fight infection.
However, several professional societies and regulatory bodies have recommended that the ECA inhibitor and ARB therapy standard continue.
A systematic review and meta-analyses published on 11 July 2012 found that 'use of ECA inhibitors was associated with a significant 34% reduction in the risk of pneumonia compared to controls'.
In addition, ' the risk of pneumonia was also reduced in patients treated with ECA inhibitors who were at high risk of pneumonia, especially those with stroke and heart failure.
The use of ECA inhibitors has also been associated with reduced pneumonia-related mortality, although the results have been less robust than for overall pneumonia risk.'
Human recombinant ECA2 (rhACE2) is believed to be a novel therapy for acute lung injury, and it appeared to improve pulmonary haemodynamics and oxygen saturation in pigs with lipopolysaccharide-induced acute respiratory distress syndrome.
The half-life of rhACE2 in humans is approximately 10 hours and the onset of action is 30 minutes after the temporal evolution of effects (duration) of 24 hours.
Many findings suggest that rhACE2 may be a promising drug for those with intolerance to classic renin-angiotensin system inhibitors (RAS inhibitors) or in diseases in which circulating angiotensin II is elevated.
COVID-19 apps are mobile software applications to assist in monitoring in response to the 2019-2020 coronavirus pandemic, i.e. the process of identifying people ("contacts") who may have come into contact with infected individuals.
Numerous applications have been developed or proposed with official government support in some territories and jurisdictions.
Various structures have been developed to create contact monitoring applications.
Privacy issues were raised, particularly with regard to systems based on tracking the geographical location of users of the app.
Less intrusive alternatives include using Bluetooth signals to record the user's proximity to other phones.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple jointly announced that they would integrate the functionality to support such Bluetooth-based applications directly to their Android and iOS operating systems.
In China, the Chinese government, together with Alipay, have implemented an app that allows citizens to check if they have been in contact with a person carrying COVID-19.
It's in use in over 200 Chinese cities. In Singapore, an app called TraceTogether is being used.
The application was developed by the local IT community, released as open source and will be handed over to the government.North Macedonia has launched "StopKorona!", a Bluetooth-based application to track exposure to potentially infected people and provide a quick response to health authorities.
The application was developed by the Ministry of Communications and Technology and the Ministry of Health.
As of April 14, 2020, the app was awaiting approval from the Google Play Store and Apple App Store.
On 12 April, the government declared that the contact tracking application was in an advanced stage of development, and would be available for distribution in weeks.
Australia and New Zealand are planning applications based on Singapore's TraceTogether app and the BlueTrace protocol. Russia intends to implement a geographic delimitation application for COVID-19 diagnosed patients living in Moscow, designed to ensure they do not leave their homes.
Ross Anderson, a professor of security engineering at the University of Cambridge, listed a number of potential practical problems with application-based systems, including false positives and the potential absence of effectiveness if application acceptance is limited to only a small fraction of the population.
In response to concerns about the spread of fake or harmful "coronavirus" apps, Apple sets limits on the types of organizations that can add coronavirus-related apps to its App Store, limiting them to only "official" or otherwise respected organizations.
Google and Amazon have implemented similar restrictions.
Privacy advocates have expressed concern about the implications of mass surveillance using coronavirus applications, especially about whether the surveillance infrastructure created to deal with the coronavirus pandemic will be dismantled once the threat has passed.
Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations issued a statement calling for limits on this type of surveillance.
The organisations have stated eight conditions for government projects:
the surveillance should be 'lawful, necessary and proportionate';
the extension of monitoring and surveillance should have suspension clauses;
the use of data should be limited to COVID-19 purposes;
the security and anonymity of data should be protected and presented as evidence-based;
Digital surveillance should avoid any further discrimination and marginalization;
any data sharing with third parties should be provided for by law;
there should be safeguards against abuse and citizens' rights to respond to abuse;
The Commission has also published a list of the most important public health experts and the most important public health experts in the field of health and safety.
The plan proposed by Google/Apple aims to address the persistent surveillance problem by removing the tracking mechanism from its device operating systems when it is no longer needed.
Some countries have used network-based location tracking instead of applications, eliminating the need to download an application and the ability to avoid tracking.
In Israel, network-based tracking has been approved.
Network-based solutions that have access to raw location data have considerable potential privacy issues.
However, not all central server systems need to have access to personal location data; a number of privacy-preserving systems have been created to use central servers only for intercommunication (see section below).
In South Korea, a non-application-based system was used to perform contact tracking.
Instead of using a single application, the system gathered tracking information from a variety of sources, including mobile device tracking data and card transaction data, combining them to generate text message alerts for potentially infected individuals.
In addition to using this information to alert potential interlocutors, the government has also made location information publicly available, which is allowed due to comprehensive changes in information confidentiality laws following the MERS outbreak in the country.
This information is made publicly available through a number of applications and websites. Countries, including Germany, are considering using both the centralized and the privacy preservation system.
As of 6 April 2020, the details had not yet been disclosed.
Contact tracking while preserving privacy is a well-defined concept, with a significant body of scientific literature dating back to at least 2013. Since April 7, 2020, more than a dozen expert groups have been working on privacy-respecting solutions, using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) to record a user's proximity to other mobile devices.
However, PEPP-PT is a coordination effort that covers centralized and decentralized approaches and is not a single protocol.
In these protocols, personally identifiable data never leaves the device, and any combination is made on the device.
The Privacy Group at the MIT Media Lab has developed Safe Paths, a platform for using privacy preservation techniques during collection and use of location or traffic data to track the spread of COVID-19.
It is based on research from the technical publication "Apps Play Dirty: Maintaining Personal Privacy in an Epidemic" released in March 2020. Another similar effort is Enigma MPC's SafeTrace platform, a venture that develops privacy technologies and was originally founded at the MIT Media Lab.
SafeTrace uses secure hardware technologies to allow users to share sensitive location and health data with other users and controllers without compromising the privacy of that data.
On 5 April 2020, the Global TCN Coalition was founded by groups that came together around what was essentially the same approach and largely overlapping protocols, with the aim of reducing fragmentation, and enabling the global interoperability of alert and tracking applications, a key aspect of achieving widespread adoption.
On 9 April 2020, the Singapore government announced that the BlueTrace protocol, used by the government's official application, has become open source.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple, companies that control the Android and iOS mobile platforms, announced a contact tracking initiative, in which they claimed they would preserve privacy, based on a combination of Bluetooth Low Energy technology and encryption for privacy preservation.
They also published specifications of the main technologies used in the system.
According to Apple and Google, the system is planned to be implemented in three stages:
development of tools to enable the government to create official coronavirus tracking applications while preserving privacy
integration of this functionality directly into iOS and Android; Google and Apple plan to address persistent and assumed surveillance issues by first distributing the system through updates to running systems, and later removing it in the same way as soon as the threat is over.
Drug repositioning (also known as drug repositioning, reperfilation, re-attribution or therapeutic replacement) is the repositioning of an approved drug for the treatment of a medical condition or disease other than that for which it was originally developed.
This is one of the lines of scientific research that is currently being adopted to develop safe and effective treatments for COVID-19.
Other research directions include the development of a convalescent plasma transfusion and vaccine for COVID-19. SARS-CoV-2 has about 66 drug-enabled proteins, each with multiple binding points.
Analyzing these link points provides the reasonable design for developing an effective antiviral drug against COVID-19 proteins.
Among the most important target proteins of SARS-CoV-2 are papain-like protease, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, helicase, S protein, and ADP ribofosfatase.
Hussein A. A., et al., studied several candidate compounds which he later refined and analyzed for their structural similarities to the most similar approved drugs in order to accelerate the development of a potent drug against SARS-CoV-2 in his preclinical study to be recommended for a clinical study design.
Chloroquine is an anti-malarial drug that is also used against some autoimmune diseases.
On 18 March, WHO announced that chlorine and related hydroxychloroquine would be among the four drugs studied as part of the Solidarity clinical trial.
New York Governor Andrew Cuomo announced that trials with New York State's chlorine and hydroxychloroquine would begin on March 24. On March 28, the FDA authorized the use of hydroxychloroquine sulfate and chlorine phosphate through an Emergency Use Authorization (AUE).
The treatment has not been approved by the FDA clinical trial process and is authorised by the EU only as an experimental treatment for emergency use in hospitalized patients who cannot receive treatment in a clinical trial.
The CDC said that "the use, dosage, or duration of hydroxychloroquine for prophylaxis or treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection" has not yet been established.
Doctors said they're using the drug when "there's no other option".
In Istanbul, a Turkish research team is conducting a small study on the use of chlorine in combination with zinc, vitamin A, vitamin C and vitamin D.
Major studies are underway at Duke University and Oxford University.
NYU Langone School of Medicine is conducting a trial on the safety and efficacy of the preventive use of hydroxychloroquine.
Chinese clinical trials in Wuhan and Shenzhen claimed to demonstrate that favipiravir was "clearly effective".
In Shenzhen, 35 patients tested negative within four days on average, while the duration of the disease in the 45 patients who did not receive it was 11 days.
In a study conducted in Wuhan with 240 patients with pneumonia, half were treated with favipiravir, and half received umifenovir.
The Italian Pharmaceutical Agency reminded the population that the existing evidence to support the medicinal product is scarce and preliminary.
On April 2, Germany announced that it would buy the drug from Japan to store it and use the military to deliver it to university hospitals, where it would be used to treat patients with COVID-19.
According to the South China Morning Post, Shinzo Abe has created openings for the Trump administration about the purchase of the drug.
It may not be safe for pregnant women or women trying to get pregnant.
A lopinavir/ritonavir (Kaletra) study, a combination of lopinavir and ritonavir antivirals, concluded that "no benefit was observed".
Drugs have been developed to inhibit HIV replication by binding to protease.
A team of researchers at the University of Colorado is trying to modify drugs to find a compound that binds to the protease of SARS-CoV-2. There are criticisms in the scientific community about directing resources to replenish drugs developed specifically for HIV/AIDS.
The WHO included lopinavir/ritonavir in the international Solidarity trial.
Remdesivir was created and developed by Gilead Sciences as a treatment for Ebola virus disease and Marburg virus infections. Gilead Sciences later discovered that remdesivir exhibited antiviral activity in vitro against the phylum, pneumonia, paramyx and coronaviruses.
One of the problems with antiviral treatment is resistance to mutations, which can lead to more serious transmission or disease.
Some early pre-trial studies suggest that remdesivir may have a high genetic barrier to resistance. Several clinical trials are underway, including two conducted by Cleveland University Hospitals, one for people with moderate disease and one for those with more severe disease.
There are three intravenous vitamin C clinical trials taking place for hospitalized and seriously ill people with COVID-19: two of them are placebo-controlled (in China and Canada), while the other does not present a control group (Italy).
New York State began testing with azithromycin, an antibiotic, on March 24, 2020.
Japan's National Center for Global Health and Medicine (NCGM) is planning a clinical trial of Teijin's Alvesco (ciclesonide), an inhaled corticosteroid for asthma.
Phase II of a study with a type of angiotensin converting enzyme 2 is underway with 200 patients to be recruited from serious hospitalized cases in Denmark, Germany and Austria to determine the effectiveness of treatment.
Currently, researchers at the Heart Institute in Canada are investigating the role of colchicine in reducing lung complications and inflammation in patients with mild symptoms of COVID-19.
The study, called COLCORONA, is recruiting 6,000 adults over the age of 40, diagnosed with COVID-19 and with mild symptoms, who did not need to be hospitalized.
Pregnant women who are breastfeeding or who do not use effective contraception were not included in the tests.
Several blood thinners are being tested in Italy.
Low molecular weight heparin is being widely used in the treatment of patients, which has led the Italian Medicines Agency to publish guidelines on its use.
A multi-centric study involving 300 patients is examining the use of sodium enoxaparin in prophylaxis and therapeutic dosages.
Because SARS-CoV-2 is a virus, the scientific community's attention has been considerable in the direction of giving new purpose to approved and developed antiviral medicines for the treatment of previous outbreaks, such as those of MERS, SARS and West Nile virus.
Ribavirin: ribavirin has been recommended for the treatment of COVID-19, according to the 7th edition of the Chinese guidelines
Umifenovir: umifenovir has been recommended for the treatment of COVID-19, according to the 7th edition of the Chinese guidelines
Some antibiotics have been identified as being able to receive a new purpose for treating patients with COVID-19:
Tocilizumab (anti-IL-6 receptor): approved in China.
There are also tests in Italy and China.
The COVID-19 vaccine is a hypothetical vaccine against the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
Although there is no vaccine with completed clinical trials, there are several ongoing attempts to develop it.
In late February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) stated that it did not expect a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2, the disease-causing virus, to be available in less than 18 months.
Five vaccine candidates were in phase I of the safety studies in April.
COVID-19 was identified in December 2019.
There was a large spread of the outbreak in 2020, which led to considerable investment and research activities for the development of a vaccine.
Several organizations are using published genomes to develop possible vaccines against SARS-CoV-2.
The Coalition for Innovation in Epidemic Preparedness (CEPI) said in April that the needs for vaccine development are speed, manufacturing capacity, large-scale development and global access.
In April, CEPI scientists reported 10 different technology platforms being researched and developed during early 2020 to create an effective COVID-19 vaccine.
The main platforms that have advanced to Phase I security studies include:
Nucleic acid (DNA or RNA) (stage I developer and vaccine candidate: Moderna, mRNA-1273)
Viral vector (phase I developer and vaccine candidate: CanSino Biologics, type 5 adenovirus vector)
As reported by CEPI scientists in April, a total of 115 vaccine candidates are in the early stages of development, with 78 of them confirmed as active projects (79, according to the Milken Institute).
A phase I-II test performs preliminary safety and immunogenicity testing. It is typically randomized, placebo-controlled and multicentered, while determining more accurate and effective doses.
Phase III trials typically involve more participants in a control group, testing the vaccine's effectiveness in preventing disease while monitoring adverse effects at the optimal dose.
Of the 79 candidates for the active vaccine in development (confirmed in early April 2020), 74 have not yet been evaluated in humans (continuing preclinical research).
On January 24, 2020, in Australia, the University of Queensland announced that it is investigating the potential of a vaccine with a molecular cluster, which would genetically modify viral proteins to stimulate an immune response.
On January 24, 2020, in Canada, the International Vaccine Centre (VIDO-InterVac) at the University of Saskatchewan announced the start of work on a vaccine, with the goal of human testing by 2021.
Projects for vaccine development were announced at the China Centre for Disease Prevention and Control on 26 January 2020 and at the University of Hong Kong on 28 January.
On 29 January 2020, Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies, led by Hanneke Schuitemaker, announced the start of their work on developing a vaccine.
Janssen is co-developing an oral vaccine with its biotechnology partner Vaxart.
On March 18, 2020, Emergent BioSolutions announced a manufacturing partnership with Vaxart to develop the vaccine.
On 8 February 2020, the OncoGen laboratory in Romania published a paper on the development of a vaccine with technology similar to that used for neoantigen vaccination therapy.
On March 25, the head of the research institute announced that they had completed the synthesis of the vaccine and were beginning testing.
On February 27, 2020, a subsidiary of Generex, NuGenerex Immnuno-Oncology, announced that they were starting a vaccine project to create a li-Key peptide vaccine against COVID-19.
They wanted to produce a candidate vaccine that could be tested on humans "in the next 90 days".
On March 5, 2020, Washington University in St. Louis announced its plans to develop a vaccine.
On March 5, 2020, the United States Army Medical Research and Development Command at Fort Detrick and the Walter Reed Army Research Institute at Silver Spring, both in the western region of Maryland, announced that they were working on a vaccine.
Around March 10, 2020, Emergent Biosolutions announced that it had merged with Novavax Inc.
in the development and manufacture of a vaccine.
The partners subsequently announced plans for preclinical testing and Phase I clinical trials in July 2020.
On March 12, 2020, the Indian Ministry of Health announced that they are working with 11 isolated people and even at a fast pace, it would take at least one and a half to two years to develop a vaccine.
On March 12, 2020, Medicago, a biotechnology company in Quebec City, reported the development of a Coronavirus-like particle under partial funding from the Canadian Institutes of Health Research.
The vaccine candidate is currently undergoing laboratory research, with human trials scheduled for July or August 2020.
Earlier that week, The Guardian reported that US President Donald Trump offered CureVac "large sums of money for exclusive access to the Covid-19 vaccine" under German government protest.
On March 17, 2020, the pharmaceutical company Pfizer announced a partnership with the German company BioNTech to jointly develop an mRNA-based vaccine.
BNT162, an mRNA-based candidate vaccine, is currently in preclinical testing, with clinical trials expected to begin in April 2020.
In Italy on March 17, 2020, Takis Biotech, an Italian biotechnology company announced that it would have preclinical test results in April 2020 and its final vaccine candidate could depart for human trials in the fall.
In France, on March 19, 2020, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness (CEPI) announced a $4.9 million investment in a research consortium for the COVID-19 vaccine involving the Institut Pasteur, Themis Bioscience (Vienna, Austria), and the University of Pittsburgh, bringing the total investment of CEPI in COVID-19 vaccine development to $29 million.
The other CEPI investment partners for the development of the COVID-19 vaccine are Moderna, Curevac, Inovio, Novavax, the University of Hong Kong, the University of Oxford, and the University of Queensland.
On March 20, 2020, Russian health authorities announced that scientists have begun animal testing of six different vaccine candidates.
Researchers at Imperial College London announced on 20 March 2020 that they are developing a self-amplifying RNA vaccine for COVID-19.
The vaccine candidate was developed within 14 days of receipt of the sequencing from China.
In late March, the Canadian government announced C$275 million in funding for 96 medical countermeasures research projects against COVID-19, including several vaccine applications at Canadian companies and universities such as Medicago and the University of Saskatchewan initiatives.
Almost in the same period, the Canadian government announced C$192 million specifically to develop the COVID-19 vaccine, with plans to establish a national "vaccine bank" of several new vaccines that could be used if further outbreaks of the Coronavirus occur.
On April 2, 2020, researchers at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine reported the trial of PittCoVacc, a possible COVID-19 vaccine in mice, stating that "MNA delivered SARS-CoV-2 subunit S1 vaccines that triggered potent antibody responses to specific antigens [in the mouse] that were evident to have been initiated 2 weeks after immunization".
In Canada on April 16, 2020, the University of Waterloo School of Pharmacy announced the development of a candidate for a DNA-based vaccine as possibly a nasal spray.
Using bacteriophages, DNA will be designed to replicate within a human bacterium to produce harmless virus-like particles, which can stimulate the immune system to produce antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
In March 2020, the US government, industry and three universities joined forces to access IBM supercomputers, in combination with cloud computing from Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Amazon, Microsoft and Google.
Some vaccines have heterologous effects, also called non-specific effects.
That means they can have benefits beyond the disease it prevents.
A further randomized trial in Australia is looking to enroll 4,170 health workers.
Developing vaccines may not be safe or effective.
Initial research to assess the efficacy of the vaccine using COVID-19-specific animal specimens such as the ACE2-transgenic mouse, other laboratory animals and non-human primates indicate a need for level 3 biosecurity containment measures to manipulate live viruses, and international coordination to ensure standardised safety procedures.
Vaccines against SARS and MERS have already been tested on non-human animals.
As of 2020, there is no cure or vaccine that protects against SARS that has been proven safe and effective in humans.
According to research papers published in 2005 and 2006, identifying and developing new vaccines and medications to treat SARS was a priority for governments and public health agencies around the world.
When MERS became prevalent, it was believed that existing SARS research could provide a useful model for vaccine development and therapeutic treatment against MERS-CoV infection.
As of March 2020, there has been one MERS (DNA-based) vaccine that has completed Phase I of clinical studies in humans, and three others in progress, all of which are virus-vectored vaccines, two with adenoviral vector (ChAdOx1-MERS, BVRS-GamVac), and one vectored by MVA (MVA-MERS-S).
Social media posts promoted a conspiracy theory claiming that the virus behind COVID-19 was known and that a vaccine was already available.
Patents cited by various social media publications indicate existing patents for genetic sequences and vaccines for other strains of Coronaviruses such as SARS Coronavirus.
Betacoronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a severe acute respiratory syndrome of Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Common symptoms include fever, cough, and shortness of breath.
Other symptoms may include fatigue, muscle pain, diarrhea, sore throat, loss of smell and abdominal pain.
The time of exposure to the onset of symptoms is about 5 days, but may vary from 2 to 14 days.
Although most cases result in mild symptoms, some progress to viral pneumonia and multiple organ failure.
As of 17 April 2020, more than 2.24 million cases had been reported in 210 countries and territories, resulting in more than 153,000 deaths.
More than 568,000 people have been cured, and the virus is spread among people mainly through direct contact, usually through droplets produced by coughing, sneezing or speech.
Although these droplets are produced when they expire, they usually fall to the ground or remain on surfaces rather than remaining infectious over long distances.
People can also become infected by touching contaminated surfaces and then touching their eyes, nose or mouth.
The virus can survive on surfaces for up to 72 hours.
It is most contagious during the first 3 days after the onset of symptoms, although spread may be possible before symptoms appear and in later stages of the disease.
The use of masks is recommended for people suspected of the virus and for those responsible for their care.
Recommendations for the use of masks by the general population vary, with some authorities recommending not to use, some recommending use and others mandating use.
Currently, there is no specific vaccine or antiviral treatment for COVID-19.
Local transmission of the disease has been recorded in most countries in all six WHO regions.
Those infected with the virus may be asymptomatic or develop symptoms similar to influenza, cough, fatigue and difficulty breathing.
Emergency symptoms include difficulty breathing, pain or persistent pressure in the chest, confusion, difficulty staying awake, facial or lip bleaching.
Less commonly, upper respiratory tract symptoms such as sneezing, runny nose or sore throat may be seen.
Gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, vomiting and diarrhea were observed in different percentages.
Some cases in China initially showed only tight chest and palpitations.
In some, the disease may develop into pneumonia, multiple organ failure, and death.
This is called the incubation period.
The incubation period for COVID-19 is normally six days, but can vary from two to 14 days.
97.5% of people who develop symptoms will develop them within 11.5 days of infection.
The role of these asymptomatic agents in transmission is not yet fully known; however, preliminary evidence suggests that they may contribute to the spread of the disease.
The proportion of infected people who do not show symptoms is currently unknown and is being studied, and the Korean Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) reported that 20% of all confirmed cases remained asymptomatic during their hospital stay.
The National Health Commission of China began to include asymptomatic cases in its daily cases on April 1, of the 166 infections that day, 130 (78%) were asymptomatic at the time of testing.
The saliva and saliva can carry large viral loads.
Speaking out frees up more droplets than normal speaking.
A study in Singapore found that coughing without covering your mouth can cause droplets to reach 15 feet [4.5 m].
Although the virus is not usually carried by air, the National Academy of Sciences suggested that bioeerrol transmission may be possible and air collectors placed in corridors outside people's rooms contained positive samples for viral RNA.
Some medical procedures, such as intubation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), may generate respiratory secretions that will be aerosolised and therefore transmitted through the air.
Although there is concern that it may be transmitted through feces, if you believe the risk is low. The virus is more contagious when people are symptomatic. Although it is possible to have transmission before symptoms appear, the risk is low.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) states that although it is not entirely clear how easily the disease spreads, a person usually infects one or two.
Specifically, it was found that the virus was detectable for one day in cardboard, up to three days in plastic (polypropylene) and stainless steel (AISI 304) and up to four hours in 99% copper.
However, this depends on humidity and temperature.
Soap and detergent are also effective if used correctly. Soap products degrade the protective lipid envelope of the virus, disabling it, and removing it from the skin and other surfaces.
Other solutions, such as benzalcone chloride and chlorhexidine glyconate (a surgical disinfectant), are less effective.
In five of the six patients, the first sample had the highest viral load, while the sixth patient had the highest viral load on the second day of testing.
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a new acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus that was first isolated in three people with pneumonia who were related to a group of acute respiratory disease cases in Wuhan.
All the characteristics of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus occur in nature, in related coronaviruses.
Outside the human body, the virus dies in contact with household soap, which breaks its protective layer.
The lungs are the organs most affected by COVID-19 because the virus accesses the host cells through the angiotensin 2 converting enzyme (ACE2), which is most abundant in type II alveolar cells in the lungs.
The virus uses a special surface glycoprotein called "specilla" (peplomer) to connect to ACE2 and enter the host cell.
Acute heart injury has been observed in 12% of infected people who have been hospitalized in Wuhan, China, and is more common in serious illness.
The rate of cardiovascular symptoms is high thanks to systemic inflammatory response and immune system disorders during disease progression, but acute myocardial injury may also be related to ACE2 receptors in the heart.
ACE2 receptors are highly expressed in the heart and are involved in cardiac function.
A high incidence of thrombosis (31%) and venous thromboembolism (25%) was found in UTI patients with COVID-19 infections and may be related to poor prognosis.Necropsies of people who died due to COVID-19 showed diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) and inflammatory infiltrates containing lymphocytes in the lung.
Although SARS-CoV-2 has tropism for ACE2-expressing respiratory tract epithelial cells, patients with severe COVID-19 experience symptoms of systemic hyperinflammation.
In particular, pathogenic T cells that secrete GM-CSF have been shown to be correlated with IL-6-secreting inflammatory monocyte recruitment and severe lung pathology in COVID-19 patients.
Lymphocytic infiltrates have also been reported in the necropsy.
The WHO has published several test protocols for the disease.
The standard testing method is the polymerase chain reaction via real-time reverse transcription (rRT-PCR).
The test is usually performed on breath samples obtained by nasopharyngeal swab, however a nasal swab or cataract sample may be used.
Results are usually available in a few hours to two days.
Blood tests may be used, but for this you need to collect two blood samples with a two-week difference and the results have little immediate value.
Chinese scientists were able to isolate a strain of coronavirus and publish its genetic sequence so that labs around the world could independently develop polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests to detect infection with the virus.
As of 4 April 2020, antibody testing (which can detect active infections and whether a person has been infected in the past) was in development but has not yet been widely used.
The Chinese's test-testing experience has shown that it's 60 to 70 percent accurate.
The United States FDA approved the first remote laboratory test on March 21, 2020, for use later that month. Diagnostic guidelines released by Wuhan University Zhongnan Hospital suggest methods for detecting infections based on clinical resources and epidemiological risk.
Bilateral multilobar dark glass gaps with peripheral, asymmetrical and posterior distribution are common at the onset of infection.
Subpleural dominance, mosaic paving (thick lobular septum with variable alveolar filling) and consolidation may appear as the disease progresses.
There is little data available regarding the microscopic lesions and the physiopathology of COVID-19.
The main pathological findings during autopsies are:
Macroscopy: pleurisy, pericarditis, pulmonary consolidation and edema of the lungs
Four types of severity of viral pneumonia can be observed:
Lymphocytic infiltration of lymphocytic glands and formation of giant multinucleated cells
The following conditions are considered:
DAD is the cause of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ADRS) and severe hypoxia.
Treated pneumonia: organization of exudate in alveolar cavities and pulmonary interstitial fibrosis
Blood: diffuse intravascular coagulation (IDC); leukoerythroblastic reaction
Preventive measures to reduce the chances of infection include staying at home, avoiding crowded places, washing hands frequently with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, practicing good respiratory hygiene, and avoiding touching your eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands.
The CDC recommends covering your mouth and nose with a scarf when coughing or sneezing, as well as covering your mouth with the inner side of your elbow if the scarf is not available.
Proper hand hygiene after coughing or sneezing is encouraged.
The CDC has recommended the use of cloth masks in public places, in part to limit transmission by asymptomatic individuals. Social distancing strategies aim to reduce contact of infected people with large groups by closing schools and workplaces, restricting travel, and cancelling large public gatherings.
Distance guidelines also include people being at least 1.8 meters (6 feet) apart from each other.
An effective medication for COVID-19 prevention is not known. Since the vaccine is not to be launched before 2021, a key point for COVID-19 control is to try to slow the peak of the epidemic, also known as "curve shortening".
The CDC also recommends that individuals wash their hands frequently using soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the bathroom or when their hands are visibly dirty, before eating and after blowing their nose, coughing or sneezing.
He also recommends using alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol, but only when soap and water are not readily available.
In these formulations, antimicrobial activity is achieved by ethanol or isopropanol.
Hydrogen peroxide is used to help eliminate bacterial spores in alcohol; it is not "an active substance for hand asepsia".
Glycerol is added as a moisturizer.
People are treated with palliative care, which may include fluid therapy, oxygen support and support for other vital organs affected.
The CDC recommends that people who suspect they're infected with the virus wear a simple face mask.
Oxygenation of the extracorporeal membrane (ECMO) has been used to treat the problem of respiratory failure, but its benefits are still under review.
Personal hygiene and healthy lifestyle and diet are being recommended to improve immunity.
Supportive treatments can be helpful for those with mild symptoms and in the early stages of infection. WHO and China's National Health Commission have published recommendations for the care of people hospitalized with COVID-19.
Intensive care physicians and pneumologists in the U.S. have gathered treatment recommendations from various agencies into a free resource, the IBCC.
As of April 2020, there is no specific treatment for COVID-19.
For symptoms, some healthcare professionals recommend paracetamol (acetaminophen) instead of ibuprofen for first-line use.
Precautions should be taken to minimise the risks of transmission of the virus, especially in the health environment when aerosol-producing procedures such as manual intubation and ventilation are being carried out.
For healthcare professionals caring for people with COVID-19, the CDC recommends placing the person in airborne infection isolation rooms (AIICs) in addition to taking standard precautions, contact precautions and air precautions.
The recommended equipment is: EPI blanket, respirator or face mask, eye protection and medical gloves. When available, it is preferable to use respirators instead of face masks.
N95 respirators are approved for industrial environments, but the FDA has authorized the masks for use under the Emergency Use Authorization (USA).
They have been designed to protect against aerial particles such as dust, but their effectiveness against a specific biological agent is not guaranteed for unspecified uses.
When masks are not available, the CDC recommends the use of facial shields or, as a last resort, home masks.
Most cases of COVID-19 are not severe enough to require mechanical ventilation or alternatives, but a percentage of cases are.
The type of respiratory support for COVID-19-related respiratory failure individuals is being studied for people in hospitals, with some evidence that intubation can be avoided with a high-flow nasal duct or positive airway pressure at two levels.
Whether either of these benefits the same for people who are seriously ill is unknown.
Some doctors prefer to keep the invasive mechanical ventilation when it is available because this technique limits the spread of aerosol particles when compared to the high-flow nasal duct.
Many developing countries do not have enough per capita hospital beds, limiting the health system's ability to cope with the sudden escalation in the number of COVID-19 cases severe enough to require hospitalization.
One study in China observed that 5% were admitted to intensive care units, 2.3% needed mechanical ventilation support, and 1.4% died.
In China, about 30% of people in the hospital with COVID-19 were eventually taken to the UTI.
Mechanical ventilation becomes more complex as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ASDR) develops in COVID-19 and oxygenation becomes more and more difficult.
Ventilators with pressure control mode and high PEEP levels are needed to increase oxygen delivery while minimizing the risk of pneumothoracic and lung injuries associated with ventilation.
High level PEEP may not be available in older fans.
Research into potential treatments began in January 2020 and clinical trials with several antiviral drugs are underway.
Remdesivir seems to be the most promising.
Although new medicines may take until 2021 to develop, several of the tested medicines have already been approved for other uses or are in an advanced testing phase.
Antiviral medication can be tested on people with various diseases.
The WHO recommended that volunteers participate in the efficacy and safety testing of potential treatments. The FDA has granted temporary authorization for the use of convalescent plasma as treatment in cases where a person's life is seriously and immediately threatened.
The clinical studies necessary to demonstrate its safety and efficacy against the disease have not yet been conducted.
In February 2020, China launched a mobile app to deal with the outbreak.
Users are requested to provide their name and ID number.
The app can detect "close contact" using monitoring data and thus the potential risk of infection.
Each user can also check the status of three other users.
If a potential risk is detected, the app not only recommends quarantine but also alerts local health authorities.Big data analytics of cell phone data, facial recognition technology, mobile phone tracking and artificial intelligence are being used to track infected people and people they have come into contact with in South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore.
In March 2020, the Israeli government authorized security agencies to track mobile phone data of people who are allegedly infected with coronavirus.
The measure was taken to reinforce quarantine and protect people who may come into contact with infected citizens.
In March 2020, Deutsche Telekom shared aggregated phone location data with the German federal government agency, the Robert Koch Institute, to investigate and prevent transmission of the virus.
Russia has implemented facial recognition technology to detect who is not complying with quarantine.
Italian regional health commissioner Giulio Gallera said he was told by cell phone operators that "40% of people still circulate".
The German government conducted a 48-hour hackathon over the weekend with over 42,000 participants.
In addition, the President of Estonia, Kersti Kaljulaid, has made a global appeal for creative solutions against the spread of the coronavirus.
Individuals may experience difficulties in quarantine, travel restrictions, treatment side effects or fear of infection itself.
The BBC quoted Rory O'Connor as saying: "The rise of social isolation, loneliness, medical anxiety, stress and an economic crisis are a perfect storm to hurt people's mental health and well-being".
The disease may develop mildly, with few or no symptoms, resembling other common diseases of the upper respiratory tract, such as the common cold.
Mild cases usually recover within two weeks, while those with severe or critical illness may take three to six weeks to recover.
Pregnant women may be at a higher risk of severe COVID-19 infection, according to data from other similar viruses, such as SARS and MERS, but there is no data from COVID-19. In some people, COVID-19 can affect the lungs, causing pneumonia.
In those most severely affected, COVID-19 can progress rapidly to adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), causing respiratory failure, septic shock, or multiple organ failure.
Complications associated with COVID-19 include sepsis, clotting disorders, and damage to the heart, kidneys, and liver.
Coagulation disorders, specifically increased prothrombin time, were described in 6% of hospital admissions with COVID-19, while renal failure was seen in 4% of that group.
Approximately 20-30% of people who have COVID-19 have elevated liver enzymes (transaminases).
According to the same report, the median time between the onset of symptoms and death was ten days, with five hospitalizations.
However, patients transferred to a UTI had a median of seven days between hospitalization and death.
In an early case study, the median time from onset of initial symptoms to death was 14 days, with a total interval of six to 41 days.
In a study by China's National Health Commission (NHC), men had a mortality rate of 2.8 percent, while women had a mortality rate of 1.7 percent.
Histopathological examinations of postmortem lung samples show diffuse alveolar damage with cellular fibromyxoid exudates in both lungs.
Viral cytopathic changes have been observed in the pneumocytes.
The lung imaging looked like acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
In 11.8% of the deaths reported by the National Health Commission of China, heart damage was detected due to high levels of troponin or cardiac arrest.
According to March data from the United States, 89% of the hospitalized had pre-existing comorbidities.
Estimates of comorbidity mortality vary due to these regional differences but also due to methodological difficulties.
Under-reporting of mild cases may cause the mortality rate to be overestimated.
However, the fact that deaths are the result of past cases may mean that the current mortality rate is underestimated.
Smokers were 1.4 times more likely to have severe symptoms of COVID-19 and approximately 2.4 times more likely to need intensive care or die, compared to non-smokers.
The Hong Kong hospital authority has seen a 20 to 30 percent drop in lung capacity in some people who recovered from the disease, and lung tests have indicated organ damage.
This can also lead to post-intensive care syndrome after recovery.
Until March 2020, it was not known whether past infections would give effective and lasting immunity to people who recovered from the disease.
Immunity is seen as likely, based on the behavior of other coronaviruses, but cases have been reported where COVID-19 recovery was followed by positive testing for coronaviruses at a later date.
These cases are believed to be the worst of a prolonged infection rather than a reinfection.
The virus is believed to be natural and animal-derived, through overflow infection.
The actual origin is unknown, but as of December 2019, the spread of the infection has become almost entirely driven by human-to-human transmission.
A study with the first 41 confirmed cases of COVID-19, published in January 2020 in The Lancet, revealed that the earliest date of onset of symptoms was December 1, 2019.
Official WHO publications reported the earliest date of onset of symptoms as December 8, 2019.
Several measures are commonly used to quantify mortality.
These numbers vary by region and over time and are influenced by the volume of tests, quality of the health system, treatment options, time since the initial outbreak and population characteristics such as age, sex and overall health.
In late 2019, WHO assigned the emergency CID-10 disease codes U07.1 for laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection deaths and U07.2 for COVID-19 deaths with clinical or epidemiological diagnosis, without laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Based on Johns Hopkins University statistics, the overall fatality rate was 6.9% (153,822/2,240,191) on April 17, 2020.
Other measures include the case fatality rate (CFR), which reflects the percentage of individuals diagnosed dying from a disease, and the infection fatality rate (IFR), which reflects the percentage of infected individuals (diagnosed and undiagnosed) dying from a disease.
These statistics are not time-limited and follow a specific population from infection to case resolution.
Although not all infected people develop antibodies, the presence of antibodies can give information about how many people have been infected.
At the epicenter of the outbreak in Italy, Castiglione d'Adda, a small town of 4,600, 80 (1.7%) have already died.
In Gangelt, the disease was spread by Carnival festivals and spread to younger people, causing a relatively lower mortality, and not all COVID-19 deaths should have been formally recorded as such.
Moreover, the German health system was not overwhelmed.
In the Netherlands, about 3% may have antibodies, as found in blood donors.
69 (0.004% of the population) had COVID-19 deaths confirmed.
The impact of the pandemic and its mortality rate are different for men and women.
Mortality is higher in men in studies conducted in China and Italy.
The greatest risk for men is in the 50s, with the difference between men and women approaching only 90.
In China, the mortality rate was 2.8 percent for men and 1.7 percent for women.
The exact reasons for the gender difference are unknown, but genetic and behavioral factors may be the reason.
Immunological differences in sex, lower prevalence of female smokers and the development by men of comorbidities such as hypertension at a younger age than women may have contributed to higher mortality among men.
In Europe, 57% of those infected were men, and 72% of those killed by COVID-19 were men.
As of April 2020, the U.S. government was not tracking data on sex-related COVID-19 infections.
Research has shown that viral diseases like Ebola, HIV, influenza, and SARS affect men and women in different ways.
A higher percentage of health workers, especially nurses, are women, and they are more likely to be exposed to the virus.
The World Health Organization announced on February 11, 2020, that the official name of the disease was "COVID-19".
WHO chief Tedros Adhanon Ghebreyesus explained that "CO" is "corona", "VI", "virus", "D", disease and "19" is from when the outbreak was identified: December 31, 2019.
The name was chosen to avoid references to a specific geographic location (e.g.: China), animal species or group of people, in accordance with international nomenclature recommendations to prevent stigmatisation.
WHO also uses "COVID-19 virus" and "COVID-19 virus" in public communications.
Both the disease and the virus are commonly called "coronavirus".
During the initial outbreak in Wuhan, China, the virus and disease were commonly referred to as "coronavirus" and "Wuhan coronavirus".
In January 2020, WHO recommended "2019-nCov" and "acute respiratory disease by 2019-nCoV" as interim names for the virus and disease, in accordance with the 2015 guideline against the use of sites in disease and virus names.
The official names COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 were published on 11 February 2020.
Due to capacity limitations in standard supply chains, some digital manufacturers are printing healthcare material, such as nasopharynx shrimp and breathing parts.
In one example, when an Italian hospital urgently needed a ventilator valve, and the supplier was unable to deliver on schedule, a local startup reversed engineering and printed the 100 valves needed overnight.
After the initial outbreak of COVID-19, conspiracy theories, misinformation and misinformation about the origin, size, prevention, treatment and other aspects of the disease emerged, which quickly spread over the Internet.
Apparently, humans are capable of transmitting the virus to some other animals.
The study failed to find evidence of viral replication in pigs, ducks and chickens.
No medicines or vaccines have been approved for the treatment of the disease.
International research on COVID-19 vaccines and medicines is ongoing in government organizations, academic groups and industry researchers.
In March, the World Health Organization began the "SOLIDARITY Trial" to assess the effects of treatment with four existing antiviral components with the most likely efficacy.
There is no vaccine available, but several agencies are actively developing vaccine candidates.
Previous work on SARS-CoV is being used because both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 use the ACE2 receptor to enter human cells.
There are three vaccination strategies being investigated.
First, the researchers aim to develop a vaccine against the full virus.
The use of this virus, whether it is inactivated or dead, aims to provoke a rapid immune response of the human body to a new COVID-19 infection.
A second strategy, subunit vaccines, aims to create a vaccine that sensitizes the immune system to certain subunits of the virus.
In the case of SARS-CoV-2, this research focuses on the spindle protein that helps the virus enter the ACE2 enzyme receptor.
A third strategy is that of nucleic acid vaccines (DNA or RNA vaccines, a new technique for creating vaccines).
Experimental vaccines of any of these strategies should have safety and efficacy tested. On March 16, 2020, the first clinical trial of a vaccine began with four volunteers in Seattle.
The vaccine contains a harmless genetic code copied from the virus that causes the disease. Antibody-dependent enhancement has been pointed out as a potential challenge to developing a vaccine for SARS-CoV-2, but this is controversial.
There have been over 300 clinical trials underway since April 2020.
Seven trials evaluated approved treatments for malaria, including four studies on hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine.
The redirection of antiviral drugs makes up the bulk of Chinese research, with nine Phase III clinical trials of remdesivir in several countries due to a report in late April.
A dynamic analysis of clinical development of COVID-19 drug and vaccine candidates was ongoing in April 2020. Several existing antiviral medicines are being evaluated for COVID-19 treatment, including remdesivir, chlorokine and hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir and lopinavir/ritonavir combined with interferon beta.
There's been an attempt to prove the effectiveness of remdesivir since March 2020.
Clinical improvement was observed in patients treated with remdesivir by compassionate use.
Phase III clinical trials are being conducted in the US, China and Italy. Chloroquine, already used to treat malaria, was studied in China in February 2020, with preliminary results.
However, there are requests for a peer review of the research.
Korean and Chinese health authorities recommend the use of chloroquine.
However, the Wuhan Institute of Virology, while recommending a daily dose of one gram, warns that twice that dose is highly dangerous and can be fatal.
On March 28, 2020, the FDA issued an emergency use authorization for hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine at the discretion of physicians treating people with COVID-19. The 7th edition of the Chinese guidelines also includes interferon, ribavirin or umifenovir for use against COVID-19.
Preliminary data indicate that high doses of ribavirin are needed to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro.
Nitazoxanide was recommended for further in vivo study after demonstrating low inhibitory concentration of SARS-CoV-2. Studies have shown that the protein from the initial serine transmembrane protease 2 (TMPRSS2) preparation spindle is essential for entry of SARS-CoV-2 through interaction with the ACE2 receptor.
Studies on chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine with or without azithromycin have major limitations that have prevented the medical community from adopting these therapies without further studies.
The cytokine storm may be a complication in the later stages of severe COVID-19.
There is evidence that hydroxychloroquine may have cytokine storm-fighting properties. Tocilzumab was included in the treatment guidelines by the National Health Commission of China after the completion of a small study.
A nationwide phase 2 non-randomized test is underway in Italy, after showing positive results in people with the serious disease.
Combined with a serum ferritin blood test to identify cytokine storms, it is expected to neutralize these developments, which are thought to be the cause of death for some affected people.
The interleukin-6 receptor antagonist was approved by the FDA based on retrospective case studies on the treatment of a different-cause steroid-induced refractory cytokine release syndrome, CAR T cell therapy, in 2017.
So far, there is no controlled, randomized evidence that tocilzumab is an effective treatment for CRS.
Transferring purified and concentrated antibodies produced by the immune system of those recovering from COVID-19 to people who need them is being investigated as a non-vaccine method of passive immunization.
This strategy has been tested for SARS, with inconclusive results.
Viral neutralization is the expected mechanism of action by which passive antibody therapy can mediate a defense against SARS-CoV-2.
Other mechanisms, however, such as antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity and/or phagocytosis, may be possible.
Other forms of passive antibody therapy, for example, using manufactured monoclonal antibodies, are in development.
The production of convalescent serum, which consists of the liquid portion of recovered patients' blood and contains antibodies specific to this virus, could be increased for faster implementation.
Coronavirus diseases, a group of strongly related syndromes
Li Wenliang, a doctor at Wuhan Central Hospital, who later contracted and died of COVID-19 after becoming aware of the spread of the virus.
