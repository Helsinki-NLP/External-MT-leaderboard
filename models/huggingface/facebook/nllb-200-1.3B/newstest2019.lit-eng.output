MG Baltic case: new lawyer for Gustavo says he has not yet seen the case file
The 11th hearing of the MG Baltic case, which took place on Monday, was attended by all the accused: Šarūnas Gustainis, Gintaras Steponavičius, Vytautas Gabšas, Eligijus Masiulis and Raimondas Kurlianskis.
The trial began with the appearances of the defendants.
At the last hearing, Alexander Doroshev, Gustav's new state-appointed lawyer, told the jury that he had not yet seen the case file.
At that time, Linas Belevičius, lawyer for MG Baltic, stated that in order to ensure full defence of the person, the College of Judges had to allow the new lawyer access to the case file and requested that the hearing be adjourned.
'In order to ensure the defence of a person, he must have access to the material of the criminal case.
This is not just a formal meeting,' said Mr Belevičius.
The new lawyer, A. Dorošev, noted that he had not been able to see the indictment or the entire case.
At the previous hearing, the suspect, Mr Gustain, announced that he would resign his lawyer because he could no longer afford to pay him.
The hearing was also recorded.
The defendants' lawyers complained that the audio recordings they had submitted to the court were of poor quality.
The Commission notes that the Commission has not yet decided on the compatibility of the aid with the internal market.
The preliminary survey interviewed more than 150 people, including more than 50 current and former Members of Parliament, several former Ministers and Members of the European Parliament.
More than 200 surveys and more than 30 ratings were carried out.
Mr Gustain is alleged to have received more than EUR 8 000, Mr Steponavičius more than EUR 15 000, Mr Gapš more than EUR 27 000, Mr Masiulis is alleged to have received more than EUR 106 000.
The Labour Party is suspected of bribery and trade-related offences, the Liberal Union of bribery, trade-related offences and abuse, and MG Baltic is suspected of buying and trading these parties.
It is alleged that politicians consulted the vice-president of MG Baltic, Mr Kurliansky, on bribery and subsequently proposed or supported pro-group initiatives in the Seimas or other institutions.
Ethics guards: Board of the Liberal Union on the rights of the Vilnius chapter
"The decisions taken by the Board are in accordance with the statutes", its head Vytautas Tamošiūnas told BNS after the meeting of the committee.
"Our decision was not a new one.
The Commission had already made an explanation in July when the question of the Pagegi and the Utana was raised.
Then we said that, by law, it was a board matter.
And if the board decides that any department can do what it wants to do, go with the committee and the board agrees, then the department can go, but if the board decides that there will be party lists everywhere, which the board has agreed, then it's a decision that all departments form party lists.
And if you don't agree with the board, then there is the possibility of suspending membership and going with the committee,' he added.
According to V.Tamoshiuno, the party's board will now decide on further actions.
On 17 October, the board of the Liberal Union of the party annulled the decision of the Vilnius city chapter to participate in the municipal elections not with the party's list, but with the newly formed electoral committee.
The party board considers that the decision of the capital's liberals to participate in the elections in the form of a public election committee violated the party's statutes and decisions of the board.
By 31 October, the Vilnius branch had to withdraw its bid to participate in the municipal elections with the list of the committee.
But the department didn't.
The former head of the department, parliamentarian Aušrinė Armonaitė, has already withdrawn from the Liberal Union.
The mayor of Vilnius, former chairman of the Liberal Union Remigijus Šimašius, has already presented the team and ideas of the public election committee "For Vilnius, of which we are proud!"
He left the party too.
Municipal council and mayoral elections will be held next March.
Residents of a village in northern India have tracked a tiger that had previously stung a man, officials said Monday.
Forestry officer Mahavir Kaujlagi said that after the tigers stabbed a man working in the fields late Sunday, villagers surrounded the animal and drove it by tractor as the female tried to escape.
Residents say that the tiger also attacked and mauled a young man about 10 days ago.
The village is located in the Dudhva Tiger Reserve in Lakhympur Kheri district, about 250 km south-east of Lucknow, the capital of Uttar Pradesh.
The hunting of tigers in protected areas is prohibited.
The Director of the Wildlife Sanctuary, Ramesh Pandey, said that the case will be reported to the police under the Wildlife Protection Act.
In April, in the Nighan district of Uttar Pradesh, villagers beat up another tiger, seriously injuring it.
The tiger is the national animal of India; tigers are considered an endangered species under the Wildlife Protection Act.
Last year, government data showed that for the previous three years, at least one person was killed every day in encounters with wild tigers or elephants.
Human conflicts with tigers have been on the rise since the 1980's, when India began a tiger protection program that established sanctuaries in national parks and made it a crime to kill big cats.
Although methods of counting tigers have varied, censuses would indicate that the tiger population of around 1 800 at the time had increased to 2 226 individuals in 2014.
Proposal for mandatory micro-labelling of cats and dogs
The chairman of the Seimas Environmental Protection Committee, Kęstutis Mažeika, together with other members of the Seimas, registered amendments to the Animal Welfare and Protection Act, which propose that cats and dogs be marked with underwear microschemes.
'We propose that cats and dogs should be required to be marked with underwear microscopes, and that registration and marking should be organised by local municipalities, the Ministry of Agriculture and the State Food and Veterinary Service.
In 2019, all dogs will be marked free of charge with state funds, and in 2020 - even cats, so residents will not have to worry and the costs will be covered by the state funding provided specifically", said Kęstutis Mažeika, chairman of the Environmental Protection Committee of the Seimas.
The amendments to the law aim to address the systematic need for labelling of pet animals.
This is expected to help avoid problems caused by irresponsible breeders, illegal breeders or traders.
It is provisionally estimated that, based on the expected average price for the micro-scheme and the service, which will be around EUR 5, all animal owners will be compensated during the transitional period.
The total cost of labelling all pet animals may reach up to EUR 6 million.
The need for these funds is planned to be spread over three years and to amount to EUR 2 million per year.
It is envisaged that funding for the labelling programmes will be provided under the special programme for the support of the municipalities in the field of environmental protection, which will see a significant increase in revenue this year due to increased taxes on natural resources and redistribution of funds.
This money will be used not only for the labelling of cats and dogs but also for castration and other programmes.
According to Ms Mažeika, the practice of compulsory marking is widespread in almost all EU countries, which allows the animals themselves to be protected (because they can easily be returned to their owners if they are lost), and saves the time of the animal owners themselves, who have to spend a lot of time and money searching for a pet that has escaped and gone astray.
In addition, EU legislation provides that only marked pets may travel.
At the same time, the marking imposes a duty to care for the animal responsibly throughout its life.
Previous proposals for compulsory labelling were opposed because the programmes concerned were proposed to be financed by the public.
'The current model should avoid this criticism, as it proposes to finance animal protection through increased revenues from the environmental support programme and to grant the right to label not only veterinarians but also members of the public, i.e. persons in animal welfare establishments who have completed special courses at the Veterinary Academy,' say the project authors.
The draft law was registered by a group of members of the Seimas representing different Seimas factions - Kęstutis Mažeika, Algiman Dumbrava, Eugenijus Gentvilis, Edmund Pupinis, Rimas Andrikis, Antanas Vinkus and others.
13 government forces killed in Taliban attack in eastern Afghanistan
Arif Noori, spokesman for the provincial governor, said seven soldiers and six police officers were killed.
He added that four more soldiers were wounded in the attack on the joint army-police checkpoint in Chogyani district.
Noori said that six fighters were killed and 10 Taliban were wounded in a three-hour battle with Afghan forces.
Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid issued a statement to the media claiming responsibility for Monday's attack in the province of Ghazni.
Noori said that this post was set up two days ago in a strategic area to cut off the Taliban supply route.
The post was completely destroyed during the attack.
"Rytas" extended a helping hand to the Ukrainian club
On Wednesday, the fourth round of the FIBA European Cup will be played at the Ryto Arena in Vilnius, between clubs from Kosovo and Ukraine.
The Dwivedi will be held in the capital for political reasons.
The Vilnius "Morning" which has warm relations with Ukrainian basketball will host the Cherkasy "Cherkaski Mavpy" and Prishtina "KB Prishtina" teams on November 7 under its roof at the "Ryto" arena.
"Due to political reasons between Kosovo and Ukraine, we could not hold this match at home, so we are very happy that our friends from Vilnius agreed to host us", said Maxim Michelson, head coach of the Ukrainian team, thanking the "Ryut".
- We have many friends in Vilnius, and our countries always get along well.
Lithuania is one of the best countries with basketball traditions in the world, so it will be a real honor for us to play here.
We're hoping to get some support from the Wolves.
The Kosovo team was unable to enter Ukraine as these countries have no diplomatic relations.
At the moment, the Ukrainian team is in third place after the first round with one win in three meetings, while the Kosovo team is in second position with more wins.
This will be a very important group E event, as only two teams will qualify for the next stage.
In the past, Vilnius hosted the Ukrainian and Kosovo qualifying matches for the 2017 European Basketball Championship.
Then the Ukrainian team celebrated the victory with a score of 100:61.
The game is free for basketball fans on Wednesday, and the doubleheader starts at 7 p.m.
"Women lie better" star actress B. Arsobite is being haunted by lies
It's probably just a coincidence, but the brilliantly brown actress Brigitte Arsobite has been cast in roles involving lies on several occasions.
First, "Women Lie Better", then "Lies", and finally, "Lies" is a comedy.
In this film, Brigitte plays the clever wife of the hero of the musical, Daniel Kazlausko.
"I really enjoyed being in Lies because I'm more of a theater actress and I rarely do movies.
The amazing team of colleagues I've assembled has promised a great result from the start.
This experience is very important and valuable to me.
But the most interesting thing that happened on the court was the puppy Sunny!
All my life I thought if I had a dog, it would be really big and serious.
I never liked those little decorative "fifi" fours.
But during the filming, Sunny became so attached to me that the sympathy became mutual and eventually I even tried to buy her from the hostess, but without success", smiles the actress.
The comical and intriguing family-members' adventures are introduced from the very first minute by the new Lithuanian comedy "Legends", produced by the producer of the Lithuanian film hits "Inexperienced" and "Among Us, Boys"... Paulius Virbickas and producers Stasys Baltakis and Vladimir Razarionov.
Your love has just announced that she is waiting.
It would be great news, except... your lover is your brother's wife!
But that's not all.
When they are not able to share the "good news" with everyone, parents suddenly declare that they are different!
After 50 years together...
And all of this is happening just before the most beautiful holiday of the year - Christmas!
But the end will be even more surprising, for such a far-reaching event was not anticipated.
All heroes are not what they seem at first glance...
In addition to the comedy "Lies" by B. Arsobaita, the audience will be given a good mood by four generations of film stars: Giedrius Savickas, Dainius Kazlauskas, Edita Užaitė, Giedrze Giedraitytė, Liubomiras Laucevičius, Larissa Kalpokaitė and Gediminas Girdvainis.
The comedy "Lies" will be in theaters on November 9.
Decide whether to write off €100 million in unpaid taxes from emigrants
The Seimas on Tuesday adopted an amendment to the law on the declaration of residence prepared by the leader of the "state" Ramón Karbausky.
56 members of the Seimas voted in favour, 9 against and 25 abstained.
The Seimas will then consider the amendments on or after 6 December, after receiving the Government's conclusions.
According to Mr Karbauski, these contributions are calculated for persons who have not declared their departure from Lithuania.
According to the MP, in three years, one person does not pay about 1,000 euros, and now there are about 100,000 such people.
The Social Democrat Algirdas Sysas regretted that the Seimas would thus "incite some people to disregard their obligations" - to declare their departure and then no taxes would be charged.
The Conservative member of the Health Committee, Antanas Matulas, noted that Lithuanians living abroad benefit from the fact that they pay a small health insurance fee and come to Lithuania for treatment - they are provided with the same services as the residents who pay this fee.
The amendments provide that persons who pay social security contributions in the European Union, the countries of the European Economic Area or the Swiss Confederation will be considered as having left Lithuania, and that the Agreement will exempt them from paying health insurance contributions in Lithuania.
The Commission notes that the aid is limited to the minimum necessary to cover the costs of the construction of the airport.
A video of a hearing bear leaking online reveals a serious problem
The baby is still climbing, slipping down, and digging again.
The video received many views and comments.
People marveled at the persistence of the little bear, who had slipped down several times and climbed back to his mother.
He may not succeed at first, but he does not give up and finally achieves his goal.
The video is indeed eye-catching, but it also reveals the threat humans pose to animals.
Scientists say that it is also important to talk about the fact that people's desire to explore the wild can sometimes be harmful.
"I can see that the bears were very frightened by the drone.
You can tell by the way they move that they're panicking.
If there were no drones flying around, they would probably have chosen a safer route or traveled slower or more carefully.
This is a great example of how drones should not be used", said ecologist Mark Ditmer to The Verge.
A while ago, Mr. Ditmer and his colleagues studied how drones affect bears.
The animals were fitted with heart rate monitors.
When the drone approached, the bears would run away, the others would not run anywhere, but their hearts would start beating faster because of the terror.
Scientists advise using drones to film animals responsibly, not flying too close, making noises, and not flying in areas that are off limits.
The president-in-exile was addressed through the newspaper.
A Kiev court on Tuesday summoned deposed Russian President Viktor Yanukovych to appear in a trial for alleged treason in an unusual manner, the official press release said.
In a court summons published in the government news paper "Uriadovoj kurjer", the former leader was invited to attend a hearing of the criminal trial on November 19 for his closing arguments.
The document states that Mr Yanukovych is entitled to attend the meeting by videoconference.
On 30 October the Kiev court declared the proceedings in the case of Mr Yanukovych closed.
Mr Goroshinsky, Mr Yanukovych's lawyer in Russia, was given until 19 November to register as a foreign lawyer in order to attend the hearing where Mr Yanukovych is expected to give his last word by video link.
In February 2014, the Kremlin-backed Yanukovych was overthrown and fled to Russia during the Maidan uprising, provoked by the president's refusal to sign an association agreement with the European Union.
Russian President Vladimir Putin later revealed that the former Ukrainian leader had been taken to Russia in a special operation organized by Moscow.
In March of that year, Russia annexed Ukraine's Crimea peninsula, and soon afterward war broke out in the east of the country between Kiev and Russian-backed separatists.
Since then, fighting has claimed some 10,000 lives, despite numerous attempts by the international community to secure a lasting ceasefire.
The list of conservatives in the Vilnius City Council is led by Valdas Benkunskas
The Conservative candidate for the year was confirmed a year earlier by former economy minister, MP Dainius Kreivys.
On the weekend, during the conservative primaries, the party members rated the list of candidates for the Vilnius City Council.
According to the party, the leader of the list of conservatives was V. Benkunskas, chairman of the meeting of the TS-LKD Vilnius chapter.
Among the first ten candidates were Paulė Kuzmickienė, Adomas Bužinskas, Gediminas Švilpa, Audrius Skaistys, Rasa Bashkienė, former member of the Seimas Liutauras Kazlavickas, the chairman of the League of Young Conservatives Mantas Benkunskas, Arūnas Valinskas and Godzija Karaitė.
Direct elections for mayors and municipal councils in Lithuania will take place on 3 March next year.
Restrictions on cogeneration plants appealed to the Constitutional Court
The opposition in the Seimas, as promised, appealed to the Constitutional Court (CT) against the decision of the ruling party to pass a law on the possibility of stopping the construction of waste incineration plants.
On Tuesday, the opposition parliamentary group Patriotic Union-Lithuanian Christian Democrats (TS-LKD) announced that a group of parliamentarians had approached the KT asking it to investigate whether the amendments to the waste management law passed by the ruling party were in line with the Constitution.
"Parliamentarians stress that the provisions of the law are aimed at questioning the projects of waste incineration plants already underway, by ordering the Government to impose new restrictions (20 km from the residential area) on the waste incineration plants that have started to be built in Vilnius and Kaunas before the law enters into force", the report says.
'Parliamentarians note that, in view of the way in which the prohibition on the construction of waste management facilities of state importance (i.e. determining the distance and defining the concept of 'habitable area') is formulated in the law, it must be concluded that this prohibition disproportionately restricts or even denies the very essence of the right to carry out economic activities related to the incineration of waste for the production of energy, since the criteria laid down are formulated in such a way that, taking into account the density of the Lithuanian population and the distribution of the country, it would be practically impossible to build such facilities throughout the country,' it adds.
The applicant submits that the law adopted is contrary to the constitutional principle of the rule of law.
'The CJEU has repeatedly stated that the legislation does not apply to those legal facts and consequences which occurred before the entry into force of the new legislation.
In this case, the Government is granted the power to apply the law retroactively on the basis of an indeterminate criterion.
The introduction of such a legal regime would infringe the constitutional principles of legal certainty, legal certainty, protection of legitimate expectations and thus the constitutional principle of the rule of law,' the application states.
It also notes that significant financial investments have already been made in the Vilnius and Kaunas cogeneration projects.
If the current projects were to be stopped, the state would not only suffer hundreds of millions in financial losses, but also huge losses for the Lithuanian population - increased heating prices, and increased environmental pollution due to the increasing amount of waste disposed in landfills.
The letter to the KT was signed by members of the Seimas from the TS-LKD, the Liberal Union, the Social Democratic factions and the senior deputy of the ruling Social Democratic Labour faction, Algirdas Butkevičius.
A couple of weeks ago, the Seimas managed to gather 71 votes to reject President Dalia Grybauskaitė's veto amendments to the Waste Management Law, which provide the government with the right to stop the construction of cogeneration plants that have already begun, and also establish a "quarantine" zone for such plants 20 km from residential areas.
The amendments to the law, which were re-adopted by the Seimas, will enter into force on 1 January 2019.
The proposal is planned to be discussed at the autumn session of the Seimas.
However, there are no plans to waive the government's right to halt projects already underway.
The CCP will examine this case in a routine manner, no earlier than one year later.
They released questionable statistics on LeBron James at the Lakers.
LeBron James's start with the Los Angeles Lakers is not what he, the organization, and the basketball fans expected.
The Lakers started the season with four wins and six losses, and such a poor start helped to fuel rumors of a possible firing of coach Luke Walton.
But that was relieved by President of Basketball Operations Magic Johnson, who said he would not let the coach go, but that he needed to play better.
The team's biggest star, L. James, should be looking out for himself.
Although the offensive stats are usually impressive, with 26.8 points, 7.6 rebounds, and 7.7 assists.
But she's not telling the whole truth.
And other statistics that came out of the first 10 games of the season showed that the Lakers were better off without L. James on the field.
The attacker is not in favour of +/- statistics showing how many more points a team scores or misses when certain players are on the field.
With L. James on the court, the Lakers have lost by 30 points this season.
He's got the Lakers 19 points clear of the competition.
The Lakers are only 13th in the Western Conference, but a few wins could turn things upside down.
Spain will continue to contribute to the protection of Lithuanian airspace
The meeting noted that Spain will contribute to the protection of the airspace of Lithuania, Estonia and Latvia in 2019 and 2020.
"Lithuania highly appreciates Spain's cooperation with NATO and I note its contribution to ensuring the security of our country and the region", said Minister Linkevičius.
The Spanish Air Force has already carried out five NATO air police and air police reinforcement missions in the Baltic States, three of which were in Lithuania.
The last time Spanish Eurofighter fighters were deployed in Siauliai was between May and August of this year.
In addition, Spain will contribute to the protection of the airspace of Lithuania, Estonia and Latvia in 2019 and 2020.
The Minister also noted that regular consultations are taking place between Lithuania and Spain on security, political, economic and strategic communication in the fight against propaganda.
Mr Linkevičius expressed the hope that Lithuania and Spain would continue to cooperate closely on European, transatlantic and other multilateral issues.
Since 2004, when Spain opened its embassy in Vilnius, Ambassador José Maria Roblesas Fraga is the fifth Spanish representative in Lithuania.
On 29 October, José Maria Robles Fraga presented the letters of appointment to President Dalia Grybauskaite.
V. Ačienė on the arrest of Mr Ačo: I believe in the man's innocence and the rule of law
"It was the most unexpected thing I could ever think of.
On the other hand, I suppose the service does the work it's supposed to do.
We're all doing our jobs.
I believe in the law, I believe in my husband, that everything is right and fair, that no dishonest actions should be made by him", Ačiene told BNS.
Aça was arrested by the Special Investigation Service (STT) on Monday, when the police suspected that he had taken a large amount of bribes while he was still the director of the Raseiniai Municipality administration, and in return could have provided exclusive conditions to a private company that had signed a contract with the Raseiniai Bus Park, which is run by the municipality.
Representatives of private companies are suspected of having directly bought Mr Ača or of having been involved in masking bribery in various financial transactions.
The Rasein district municipal council dismissed Mr Ača from his post as head of the administration on April this year, after a motion of no confidence.
The former "organizer" became a member of the newly formed Lithuanian Social Democratic Labour Party led by Gediminas Kirkilo in March of this year, and he suspended his membership in this party on Monday.
Mr. Acz ran unsuccessfully for mayor a few years ago as a representative of the Tavo Rasiniai electoral committee.
Mr Ačienė says that the man did not intend to run for mayor of Rasein next year, but had not yet decided whether to contest the municipal council elections.
V. Ačienė was elected to the Seimas on the list of the Lithuanian Peasants and Greens Union, she is a member of the Seimas Anti-Corruption Commission.
The politician says she's waiting for further law enforcement action, depending on whether she steps down from the task force.
"I'm not really making any quick decisions today, I think I'll make them this week.
I'll see if there's a need to press charges, which is obvious, and I'll make one or the other.
I probably need to stay away from all the things that are being investigated by the Anti-Corruption Commission, but again, it's time to put everything back together,' she said.
Radvilė Morkūnaitė-Mikulėnienė, a representative of the opposition conservatives in the Seimas, urged Seimas President Viktor Pranckietis and the leader of the "state parties" Ramūnas Karbauskis to dissent from the statements of her colleague Vida Ačiena and to withdraw her from the Seimas Anti-Corruption Commission, moving her to work in another Seimas committee or commission.
It argues that the continued work of Ms Ačiena on the Seimas Anti-Corruption Commission 'would create a well-founded distrust in the public and discredit the work of the important parliamentary oversight committee'.
The music of Coldplay also fascinated famous Lithuanian couples
On Monday evening, music and film lovers gathered for the preview of Coldplay: A Head Full of Dreams.
The event was attended by a large group of well-known persons: John and Simon Naine, Ignatius Lely, Martin Tyla, and many others.
The film tells the story of one of Britain's most popular post-rock bands, Coldplay, which is intertwined with moments from concerts.
Matt Whitecross, the documentary director, met the band when they were still playing in bars and gathering only a few dozen people.
The film features never-before-seen footage from behind the scenes of concerts, rehearsals, and leisure time.
Vocalist and pianist Chris Martin and guitarist Jonny Buckland met in college in 1996 and formed the band Pectoralz.
Soon they were joined by bassist Guy Berryman and, shortly thereafter, drummer Will Champion.
The band changed their name to Coldplay and just twenty years ago released their first record, Safety, which contained three songs.
Of the 500 copies, most were distributed to radio stations, producers, and friends, and only 50 copies of Safety were sold.
Coldplay is now a well-known, respected, and beloved band worldwide, with seven albums that have sold more than 100 million copies.
Over the course of two decades, the band has won 107 awards, including nine Brit Awards and seven Grammys.
Juventus win by winning the MVP of the week

High is the fourth most valuable player this season.
Martyn Gecevičius and Kšištof Lavrinović (both Skycop from Prine), Yannick Franke (Milk Stars from Pasvali) and Jerai Grant (Neptune from Klaipeda) were among the five most useful players of the week, along with V. Čepukaic.
Just recently, the newest member of the Pasvali team, Y. Franke, scored 24 points, recovered 10 balls and caused 8 opponents to lose, collecting 31 utility points in a 88:93 loss to the Priene Skycop.
True, the team's defeat did not prevent him from becoming the most valuable player of the week.
The Guineans' tie with the Pasvalli team's legionnaire is made up of his opponent of the day - the Prine team representing M. Gecevičius.
He scored 19 points and recovered 9 balls.
These indicators guaranteed the sniper a usefulness score of 26.
In the high jump, another Skycop basketball player can be seen - K. Lavrinovičius scored 15 points in Sunday's matches (3/4 second, 9/11 penalty), provoked 7 opponents' losses and collected 23 utility points.
The fifth place was also taken by J. Grant, a forward from Klaipeda "Neptouno" who played a powerful match in Vilnius.
The American scored 25 points (10/11 second), returned 4 and took 3 balls in 25 minutes, and scored 29 utility points.
This legionnaire's performance allowed the Klepedans to triumph in the capital against local "Dawn" 78:66.

Palestinian knife-wielding Israeli killed in West Bank
The soldier "prevented this attack by identifying the terrorist who tried to stab civilians and an IDF (Israeli Defense Forces) soldier", according to a statement released by the Israeli army about the incident near the Kiryat Arba compound near Hebron.
"The soldier fired on the terrorist and neutralized him.
He was taken to the hospital.
No Israeli civilians or IDF soldiers were injured", the report added.
A military spokeswoman told AFP the attack was attempted by a Palestinian.
The video footage from the incident shows him with minor injuries.
A wave of similar Palestinian attacks began in 2015.
While such attacks have declined in recent years, there are fears of a new wave.
On October 22, a Palestinian man was shot dead after stabbing a group of Jewish soldiers near Hebron.
Grybauskaitė calls on China to create a more favourable investment environment for EU business
President Dalia Grybauskaitė calls on China to create a more favourable investment environment for investments from the countries of the European Union (EU) and to facilitate foreign imports.
At the opening of the Trade and Investment Forum at the China Import Expo in Shanghai, Mr Grybauskaitė stressed that, in the face of signs of economic slowdown, the common European and Chinese objective should be to 'unite efforts to prevent the spread of protectionism in the world' by addressing the root causes of the trade war tensions, 'overproduction and unfair competition'.
'The European Union attaches great importance to China's commitment to creating a more attractive and open environment for investment, which is important in the negotiation of the trade agreement with China.
It is important to conclude this trade agreement as soon as possible, ensuring that foreign business feels welcome and safe here, as well as strengthening the protection of intellectual property", said D. Grybauskaitė.
She said that China's opening up was important not only for Europe but also for the country and for global economic growth.
The Lithuanian leader stressed that investment transparency must "be above the interests of any business group".
"Transparency, the rule of law, strict compliance with international treaties - these must be essential to the new investment relationship environment", emphasised D. Grybauskaitė.
"Corrupt capital flows should not be expected in any country in the world - not just here or in our countries", she added.
The Chinese import fair is trying to mitigate criticism that it is avoiding opening its market and protecting only its own companies.
The exhibition is attended by heads of several countries, more than 2800 companies from 130 countries and regions of the world, including Lithuania.
According to the Lithuanian Statistics Department, China is currently ranked 25th among export partners.
Last year Lithuania's exports to China grew by 50 percent, reaching EUR 180 million.
At the same time, imports from China exceeded EUR 820 million.
Some officials are concerned that Chinese investment in Lithuania could bring unwanted political influence, and Beijing's focus on Eastern Europe is tearing the EU apart.
Trouble solved: mobile signatures are already in place
The Estonian IT provider SK ID Solutions, a provider of mobile signatures, reports that the failure of the mobile signatures system has been resolved and the service is operating as normal.

The Lion Air crash is revealed: the anger of the dead
The black box of the Lion Air flight from Indonesia showed a speedometer malfunction on at least four of its last flights, investigators said Monday.
The Chairman of the National Transportation Safety Committee (NTSC) Soeryantho Tjahjoon said that similar flights have occurred on four recent flights, including the fatal one on 29 October when the liner crashed in the Java Sea shortly after take-off from Jakarta.
All 189 people on board died in that crash.
Several media outlets reported problems on an earlier Boeing 737 MAX 8 flight from Denpasar to the Indonesian capital.
"When we opened the black box - yes, the real technical problem was the airspeed, in other words, the airspeed of the plane", Tjahjono said at a press conference.
'The black box data showed that the same problem was also present on two flights prior to the Denpasar-Jakarta flight,' he added.
"There are a lot of rumors on social media.
We now want to clarify that the black box (data was found) is about four flights where there were problems with the airspeedometer", the NTSC head said.
During a meeting with the families of the deceased, Mr Tjahjono said that the information from the flight recorder was consistent with reports that the plane had varied in speed and altitude after its last take-off.
Search teams have yet to find the second black box recording the cockpit conversations.
Lion Air stated that a technical failure on a flight from Bali to Jakarta was corrected in accordance with the manufacturer's recommendations.
One of the company's founders, Rusdi Kirana, was not invited to speak to Communications Minister Budi Karyos Sumadi, who hosted a meeting of family members with officials overseeing the search for the plane and the remains of the victims and the investigation into the crash.
However, he stood up and bowed his head when angry and grieving family members demanded that Mr. Kirana, who co-founded Lion Air with his brother Kusnan in 1999, present himself.
Lion Air was misbehaving", said one man, identifying himself as passenger Shandy Johan Ramadhano, the father of a prosecutor on the island where the plane was flying.
"I want Mr. Rusty Kirana and his team to pay attention", he stressed.
- Lion Air has never contacted me since the crisis.
We lost our child, but Lion Air showed no compassion".
After this meeting, Mr Kirana left in a hurry, avoiding any questions from the press.
Many families are waiting for the results of the lengthy identification process.
Nearly 140 body bags containing human remains were handed over to the medical experts.
Only 14 victims have been identified so far.
Relatives questioned why the airliner, which was launched two months ago, was allowed to fly after a crash on the 28 October flight from Bali to Jakarta, which caused passengers to panic and the plane plunged downward shortly after takeoff.
Lion Air said that the malfunction has been resolved.
"Is it true that the problem was solved?" asked the son of one of the victims.
- If not, the technicians involved must be held accountable.
The law is very clear, they didn't say the plane was allowed to take off again.
These bad technicians must be held accountable by law so that no more plane crashes occur in Indonesia.
The Commission also concluded that the aircraft had been damaged by the collision and that the aircraft had been damaged by the collision.
"The plane was uninjured when it crashed into the sea.
"The aircraft did not explode in mid-air, and when it hit the water, the aircraft's engines were in high gear, as evidenced by all the cracked turbines", the official explained.
The Lion Air crash is the worst aviation disaster in Indonesia since 1997 when a Garuda plane crashed near Medan killing 234 people.
After the accident, rescuers led from the wreckage: victim and minor
On Monday night, a BMW and a Mercedes-Benz collided on the Vasaiti-Plunges road near Tilvik.
Cars collided in a roundabout, with three people reported injured.
It is reported that a BMW driver born in 1999 was driving on the opposite side of the road and collided head-on with a Mercedes-Benz car carrying a father born in 1967 and a daughter born in 2005.
The BMW driver was rescued from the wreckage by firefighters.
A Mercedes-Benz girl has her teeth knocked out in an accident.
All the injured have been taken to the hospital.
Presidency: no artificial easing of the referendum
After the parliament approves the ruling party's proposal to reduce the referendum cartel to Section 1 of the Constitution, which currently has greater protection, the president will veto the amendment, says her adviser Mindaugas Lingė.
"More than half the population voted for the Constitution - that is the demand.
This and its amendment, in particular the articles in its first section, should certainly be by a majority not less than .
It is easy to predict that the president will veto", Dalia Grybauskaitė's adviser on domestic policy told Žini Radio on Tuesday.
He stressed that the first section of the Constitution defines the fundamental aspects of the state - language, flag, territory, capital, state sovereignty - and that reducing the number of votes required to change these articles would create a "negative precedent" and "open up an uncontrollable risk".
"The president believes that no artificial easing is needed, but rather preparation for the referendum itself, more dialogue with the people", he said.
The Seimas is scheduled to vote on Tuesday on the adoption of an amendment to the Referendum Law.
It provides that a decision on the amendments to the more protective sections 1 and 14 of the Constitution is to be taken if at least two fifths of the citizens entitled to vote vote in favour of it in a referendum.
At present, Articles 1 and 14 of the Constitution can be amended by referendum by more than half of all citizens entitled to vote.
About 2.5 million citizens in Lithuania have the right to vote: half would be 1.25 million voters, two-fifths - one million voters.
The proposal came after the Seimas approved in September a presidential veto on amendments previously passed by parliament that relaxed the voting requirements for changing Article 12 of Section 1 of the Constitution, which defines citizenship.
The referendum is proposed to be reduced in preparation for the referendum on dual citizenship, which should take place on 12 and 26 May next year, when the first and second rounds of the presidential election are planned.
Emigrants who have emigrated since the restoration of independence on 11 March 1990 are currently, with some exceptions, not allowed to hold dual citizenship.
The Lithuanian community worldwide is seeking dual citizenship, but fears that under the current conditions the referendum will not take place - not enough people will come to vote.
R. Masiulis: Lithuanian airports are 'crazy' and need to be upgraded
Lithuania's airports and road infrastructure are starting to fail and need to be upgraded, says Minister of Transport Rokas Masiulis.
The Commission notes that the Commission has not yet decided on the compatibility of the aid measure with the internal market.
'Air transport infrastructure is already in disrepair as it was designed for smaller passenger flows.
We have to renew Vilnius airport - it's not even in the long-term planning, it's the minimum we have to do", Masiulis said at a communication conference held by the Democratic Development Fund and the magazine "Valtnost" on Tuesday.
According to the Minister, the next decade will be very important, because important projects will have to be implemented - the completion of Via Baltica, Rail Baltica, the construction of the outer port of Klaipeda, the renovation of Vilnius and Kaunas airports, and possibly the construction of a new airport.
"The next decade will be very important - we have to complete the integration of roads, railways, the construction of the outer port in Klaipeda, the reorganization of airports, maybe decide on the construction of a new airport.
We must not sleep, we must start projects now that will reach our potential in 10, 20 or 30 years' time,' said the Minister of Transport.
Mr Masiulis reiterated that in recent years too little money has been allocated to road maintenance.
"The road situation is not improving because of insufficient funding.
We can build new roads, but even basic maintenance, such as highways, is underfunded.
We have to set the amount that should be spent on road maintenance if we want to improve their condition,' said Mr Masiulis.
He stressed that Lithuania's transport services exports grew by 18.6% this year, with Germany becoming the largest export market, overtaking Russia.
Mr Masiulis again criticised the European Commission's proposal that EU carriers would be obliged to return trailers periodically to the country of registration.
"We must make our exporters in Western Europe feel at home.
I think that the idea of sending the tractor-trailers home all the time is absurd, because in Europe, empty trucks would be running, burning fuel, increasing emissions.
The railways will benefit most from this, as costs will rise to the point where some of the transport will be shifted to rail.
We are looking for ways to defend our positions,' said Mr Masiulis.
According to the Ministry of Transport, the transport sector accounts for 12.2%.
The total value of the Union's external assistance is EUR 7 billion.
It employs more than 118,000 people and has more than 7,500 enterprises.
Dispute with the Heirs
Last week, Masiulis announced in the Seimas Economic Committee that he had begun negotiations on the cultural redevelopment of the Vilnius Airport building, which would allow the demolition of the old terminal and the construction of a new one.
However, the interim head of the Department of Cultural Heritage (KPD), Algimantas Degutis, called Masiulio's deliberations political pressure.
He said that the building built in the 1960s is a property, registered in 1993, and it is not the politicians but the professionals who have to decide whether to remove it.
Mr Masiulis then commented that a modern arrival terminal would contribute to improving Lithuania's image.
"Removing the old terminal from the heritage would be a politically important step, so that it can be demolished and a new modern arrival terminal built, so that when you fly to Vilnius you feel in a modern country, not in an interesting one that does not really represent our country as innovative", Masiulis said last week in the Seimas.
The Commission also notes that the airport's capacity is limited to a limited number of passengers, and that the airport is not subject to the State aid rules.
This transport hub should be operational in 2026 after the completion of Rail Baltica.
The Commission notes that the airport's capacity is not sufficient to cover the costs of the airport's operations.
The Commission notes that the airport services agreement was signed on 1 January 2009 and entered into force on 1 January 2009.
What are Lithuanian soldiers doing in Afghanistan?
The BNS shall report on the tasks they carry out.
In total, almost 50 Lithuanian soldiers are serving in Afghanistan.
The cabal.
The headquarters of the Kabul International Airport in the Afghan capital is staffed by soldiers from the logistics element, who serve all Lithuanians deployed in the country, organizing visits and rotations of soldiers.
The headquarters also houses two Lithuanian Special Operations Forces soldiers, who ensure the coordination of NATO mission command and combat support with the 'specialists' in Kandahar.
The NATO Mission for Strong Support is staffed by military police officers who are responsible for maintaining order.
The same headquarters is staffed by officers of the Lithuanian General Staff.
They are responsible for intelligence, operations, planning and logistics.
The Kandahar.
In Kandahar, southern Afghanistan, there are about 30 Lithuanian Special Operations Forces soldiers.
They trained a local police special operations unit, which has about 150 Afghans.
Officers of the SOP shall be trained by soldiers on or off their own training sites.
The Aitvaram also has a military Air Force fighter piloting drones.
Herat, you know.
The headquarters in this city in northwestern Afghanistan is staffed by staff officers.
They work in the boards responsible for military training, logistics, intelligence, operations and planning.
Direct flights from Vilnius to Madagascar next year
The next spring, the largest regular passenger plane, the Boeing 767, will land at Vilnius Airport, which will fly passengers from Lithuania directly to the island of Be, which belongs to Madagascar, according to the tour operator Itaka Lietuva.
It is announced that passengers of Blue Panorama will be able to choose from 259 seats in Economy Class and 8 in Business Class.
The new holiday route will be accessible directly from Lithuania from April 2019.
Dominic Milowskis, CEO of Itaka Lietuva, says that Lithuanian tourists are trying to find new holiday destinations.
Madagascar is an island in the Indian Ocean, off the eastern coast of Africa.
The Commission notes that the measures in question are not compatible with the internal market.
For example, Novaturas and Itaka will start direct flights from Vilnius to Tirana (Albania).
Finance Minister on the potential crisis: the importance of not talking about disease
"We must always be prepared for the worst.
What I want to rejoice about is that for the third year in a row, for the first time in Lithuanian history, we are accumulating reserves.
But it is also very important not to talk about disease,' said Mr Shapoka in Brussels on Monday.
ELTA recalls that on Monday and Tuesday, Finance Minister and Vice-Minister Migli Tuskien will attend the Euro Group and the EU Economic and Financial Affairs Council (ECOFIN) meetings in Brussels.
The ECOFIN meeting will discuss issues related to the taxation of digital services.
The new tax aims to avoid fragmentation of the EU single market, as some Member States have already introduced or are planning to introduce a certain tax at national level.
In the short term, it is proposed to agree on how the income generated from the provision of certain digital services should be taxed in the EU Member States, pending agreement at global level.
The Eurogroup will review the draft budgets of euro area countries submitted to the European Commission (EC).
On 23 October, the Commission rejected Italy's draft budget as not in line with the Stability and Growth Pact.
This is the first time that the EC has taken advantage of this opportunity.
Further information is requested from Belgium, France, Portugal, Slovenia, Spain.
The Eurogroup will also discuss issues of deepening economic and monetary union: the possibilities of implementing a European deposit insurance scheme and reforming the European Stability Mechanism (ESM).
Lithuania supports a stronger role for the ESM in financial support programmes, but it is considered that the ESM's functions need to be clearly defined in order to avoid duplication of functions between the ESM and other EU institutions.
White Boy. What are you doing?
Lithuanian work traditions and customs
Recently, 120 years have passed since the birth of the famous Lithuanian photographer and cultural artist, ethnographer and explorer Balio Buračo (1897-1972) in Sidariu, Šiaulėnai village, then in Šiauliai province.
On the occasion of the 100th anniversary of the Lithuanian state, we have the opportunity to recall how the reviving national revival called many Lithuanians, including brothers Buračus - Bali, Jon, Broni - from the very depths of the countryside to participate creatively in the cultivation, meaning and preservation of our cultural traditions.
By travelling around his native country with his camera in his hands for more than 50 years, Balys Burač has presented a broad and realistic picture of our country's customs, traditions, folk art and material culture.
He sought to preserve the rapidly disappearing fabric of national culture and had a rare ability to appreciate the enduring value of his work.
In Balio Buračo's photographs, Lithuanian landscapes, hills, everyday life and festive atmosphere were immortalized by our people in national costumes, which adorned the pages of Lithuanian newspapers and magazines.
This publication presents a large part of the legacy of Bali Buraco, which is devoted to the description of the national working customs and related traditions and, most importantly, their attractive iconography.
The material presented shows not only the uniqueness and beauty of these traditions but also the progress of our civilization over the past century, despite two world wars and heavy occupation.
The manuscript contains a rich record of the activities, festivals, and other traditions and customs of the people of the Zemaitians of the Trans-Urukia region, especially the Kupishkin, Shulyen, Telshish, and the people of Aukštaiti and Dzukija in Bali Burač.
From some 10,000 negatives in museums and archives, over 400 rare, mostly unpublished, photographs were selected and grouped by text.
They reflect the unique aspects of ethnic culture of the Kupishkin, Dzuks and other regions of Aukštaitija and Zemaietia.
In Panevėžys, a suspect escaped from a police car and was detained for four hours.
How a young man (born 1994) managed to escape from a service car is not yet clear to authorities.
He was taken into custody on suspicion of theft.
At about 4 p.m., police released a photo of the runner and appealed to the public for help: "Suspected burglar Dalius Malakauskas (born 1994) escaped from the official car.
The person escaped with the secondary.
If you see this person, please call 112 or 8700 60000.
It is completed.
It's 5:35.
The police department reported: "The suspect has been arrested in Panevėžys, facing another case for attempted escape.
Thank you all for your help.
Tragic fate of the couple: They died within hours of their wedding
A newlywed couple died just hours after a helicopter crash in southwestern Texas, U.S.A.
William Troy Byler, 24, and his wife of the same age, Bailee Raye Ackerman Byler, died shortly after midnight Sunday when a helicopter crashed into a hill ten miles northwest of Juwel and 80 miles west of San Antonio, said local Justice of the Peace Steven Kennedy.
The odd thing is that the accident happened about 15 miles [24 km] down, the same age as the newlyweds.
Helicopter pilot Gerald Douglas Lawrence, 76, was also killed.
The newlyweds were studying at Sam Houston State University in Huntsville, Texas.
They were married on Saturday night at the Byler family ranch near Juwelles and flew out on the family helicopter after the wedding.
The accident occurred when the helicopter landed at approximately 15 miles [24 km].
The newlyweds flew to San Antonio International Airport, where they were planning to board a plane and fly on their honeymoon, Kennedy said, without specifying the couple's final destination.
"It's a very rocky, uneven terrain, and the hill is about 400 to 1,000 feet [120 to 150 m] high", Kennedy said.
G.D. Lawrence flew the family's planes for many years.
Kennedy said he was a helicopter pilot and served in Vietnam.
An autopsy should determine the physical condition of the pilot and whether it could have been the cause of the crash.
The helicopter crashed about 5 to 10 minutes after takeoff.
Its debris is scattered over a steep slope and the hull remains "dangerously loose", said Craig Hatch, an aviation safety analyst with the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), at a news conference on Monday.
Investigators are planning to remove the debris and then examine it thoroughly, but it will not be easy for a tow truck or a truck to reach the site, he said.
The cause of the disaster has not yet been determined and the preliminary NTSB report is expected to be published in two weeks.
Israeli Prime Minister calls the entry into force of new sanctions on Iran "historic day"
"Today is a historic day", Netanyahu told members of parliament from his Likud party, his office said.
"Today is the day when under the leadership of President (Donald) Trump (Donald Trump) the United States imposed extremely harsh sanctions on Iran, the toughest sanctions on Iran since efforts to contain its aggression began", the Israeli prime minister said.
Earlier on Monday, Israeli Defense Minister Avigdor Lieberman said that the new sanctions would deal a "decisive" blow to Israel's actions in the region.
The measures, which Washington calls the "toughest sanctions ever", were imposed after Trump's controversial decision in May to withdraw from the world power accord with Tehran over its nuclear program.
The sanctions are aimed at significantly reducing Iran's oil exports, which have already fallen by around one million barrels per day since May, and at cutting off Tehran from international financing.
Israel has long opposed the Iran deal and says its scope and timing are too limited.
The State of Israel also claims that the lifting of sanctions has allowed Iran to finance militant groups and its own military activities.
Israel is particularly concerned about Iran's actions in neighboring Syria and has vowed not to allow it to establish a military presence there.
The other parties to the Iran deal - Britain, France, Germany, China and Russia - oppose the U.S. decision and say the deal has so far prevented Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons, as intended.
The court re-examines the circumstances of the death of a young motorcyclist
The death of a young motorcyclist in Vilnius, in the Northern Town, in the case of an accident that ended the court will hear the testimony of the witness.
The Vilnius District Court ruled on Tuesday that one of the witnesses will be questioned at the next hearing on November 26 in order to clarify all the relevant circumstances of the case.
The prosecution has already issued a declaratory judgment in this case, but it does not agree with it.
On August 22, the Vilnius City District Court acquitted the driver of a fatal motorcycle accident, declaring 79-year-old Eduard Osipova guilty of speeding and gross misconduct.
The Vilnius District Prosecutor's Office asks the district court to annul the judgment of the district court and claims that Mr Osipov is the main culprit in the accident, and the district court's conclusions are unfounded.
The lawyer for the family of the deceased motorcyclist also asks that the acquittal be overturned.
The accident occurred on 11 August 2015 at around 15.00 hours when a Škoda Fabia car driven by E. Osipov entered Zrmunu Street from Lakunou Street and collided with a motorcycle on the main road.
The prosecution accused the man of driving a car that violated the Road Traffic Act and caused a traffic accident that killed a man riding a Piaggio motorcycle on the main road.
Initial police reports stated that the motorcycle driver was killed, but later investigations determined that the vehicle was equivalent to a motorcycle in terms of power.
Judge Roland Bužinski of the Vilnius District Court told BNS that experts found that the motorcycle rider was travelling at 89.2 kilometres per hour, although the speed limit was 50 kilometres per hour.
"The driver could not have anticipated that the motorcycle would go at such a high speed", said the judge.
At the time, the elderly driver of the car claimed to have been traveling at only five or six miles per hour.
The motorcycle rider saw an obstacle and tried to brake and fell off the vehicle before colliding with the Škoda Fabia.
The prosecution believes that Mr. Osipov, who was driving from the sidewalk to the main road, must have given way to a motorcyclist.
The Novaya Gazeta: Six Wagner employees killed in Syria
The dead included five Syrian military personnel and six individuals belonging to the Wagner military company.
This is reported by the Nova Gazeta, a Syrian source.
According to the source, one of the units of the 5th Syrian Army Corps is deployed in the area, with a large number of Syrian volunteers and "mercenaries" joining it.
Novaya Gazeta sent a request to the Russian Foreign Ministry requesting information on the fate of the Russians.
The former King of Belgium will have to take a paternity test
This decision is a partial triumph for the artist Delphine Boel.
She has been seeking recognition as the child of the former monarch since 2013.
The 50-year-old woman claims that her mother, Baroness Sybille de Selys Longchamps, and Albert II had a wholly romantic affair decades ago.
The 84-year-old former king denies fatherhood.
According to the RTBF of the station, he can appeal to the Supreme Court against the DNA test.
According to the Court of Appeal, Jacques Boel, the ex-husband of Delphine's mother, is neither the biological nor the legal father of the artist.
The investigation was requested by Delphine to be recognized as the "real" father Albert's daughter.
The KLA will give money to the parties, but nothing to the social workers
The Central Electoral Commission (CEC) is planning to allocate almost €3 million in budgetary grants to the largest political parties this week.
The ruling Lithuanian Social Democratic Labour Party (LSDDP), which was founded in the spring of this year and is led by Deputy Speaker Gediminas Kirkilo, has not yet been allocated any budgetary funds.
However, they may be allocated in the near future by a separate decision of the NRA, should the legal environment governing the allocation of grants to the parties change.
Laura Matjošaiite, Chair of the CoR, informed the VP that "a committee meeting is planned for this Thursday, where a decision on the allocation of the half-yearly budget allocation to the parties is planned".
According to the Commission, the Board of Appeal must decide on this matter by 15 November.
The budget allocation is EUR 2,751 million for seven parties, six of which are parliamentary.
The opposition Patriotic Union-Lithuanian Christian Democrats is expected to receive more than EUR 0.66 million, the governing Union of States and Greens - about EUR 0.55 million, the opposition Social Democratic Party - about EUR 0.5 million, the opposition Union of Liberals - almost EUR 0.4 million, the Labour Party, which does not have its own parliamentary group in the Sejm - about EUR 0.23 million, the recently joined ruling Order and Justice Party - almost EUR 0.22 million, the parliamentary group represented by neither the governing party nor the opposition party in the Polish election campaign - the Union of Christian Families - about EUR 0.18 million.
Under the current law, which the RK will follow, grants are awarded to parties that meet the requirements of the law and have received at least 3% of the votes in the last elections to the Seimas, municipal councils and the European Parliament.
The current legal framework therefore does not allow the LSDDP, which was established only this spring, to expect to receive any money from the budget.
This party has not yet participated in any elections.
The ruling coalition is trying to change the law so that social workers can get at least a couple of hundred thousand euros in the run-up to three elections next year - municipal, presidential and European Parliament.
The amendments to the Political Parties and the Budget of this year's laws adopted by the Seimas were vetoed by President Dalia Grybauskaitė.
The Seimas has not yet decided on this veto, but the governing representatives of Mr Kirkil and the leader of the Peasant Greens, Ramunas Karbauskis, say that the MPs will try to reject the President's objections.
However, this will not be possible before the Board meeting on Thursday, and according to Mr Matjošaiytė, "the grants will be distributed according to the legal order that has existed until now".
The Chairperson of the Committee did not deny that if the Seimas rejects the presidential veto this week or next week and a new amendment to the allocation of budget funds to parties enters into force, a decision on the allocation of additional grants to individual political forces, including the LSDDP, may be under consideration in the committee.
"We will take into account the entire legal environment in our decision-making, as we are the executive body that has to implement the laws that are being passed", she said.
If the Seimas were able to reject the veto and the new laws came into force, the government would allocate additional money to the parties, and would borrow the corresponding amounts.
The grants already distributed to the seven lots would not be affected by such a decision.

Poroshenko: the people who ordered the murder of activist Handziuk must be punished
"I want to say that not one version - and there are more than 20 versions today - will be rejected.
Each will be examined in a very thorough manner, following the procedures of the investigation.
As president, I have no right or need to have access to information that could jeopardize the course of the investigation.
However, the government must ensure transparency and the law enforcement agencies must work efficiently.
Only then will the truth be known and the evil punished", Poroshenko told a youth meeting in Kiev on Tuesday.
He stressed that he was most interested in the investigation of the murder of Mr Handziuk and that the killers, organizers and sponsors of the crime "should be held to the necessary responsibility".
"After this case was reclassified as murder, they are rightly and rightly facing life imprisonment", the Ukrainian president said.
He rightly called the public's demand for an open and impartial investigation of this case.
Poroshenko stressed that the statements of law enforcement officials in parliament should show that "the government is determined to bring criminals and murderers to justice, whoever they are".
He also said that political speculation on the subject would not clarify the situation but would confuse matters further.
"I urge all forces, both those in power and those in opposition, not to waste unfounded arguments and, for God's sake, not to use this murder for public relations", the president said.
- On the contrary, we must now unite and ensure that the investigation is effective, fair and transparent, fast - one that builds public trust.
There is no other way".
"Nobody will be allowed to use this situation to destabilize the situation in the country", he assured.
In July, the anti-corruption activist K. Handziuk was attacked and acid-coated in the city of Cherson.
She was an adviser to the mayor of this southern Ukrainian town.
The woman was hospitalized after the attack, but died in hospital on Sunday.
After the police and prosecutors failed to identify the perpetrators of the attack, Ukraine's Prosecutor General Yuri Lucenka handed in his resignation on Tuesday.
After her death, authorities were accused by activists of failing to conduct an adequate investigation.
The activists also demanded the resignation of the Attorney General and the Minister of the Interior.
"I am resigning today", Mr Lucenka told MPs, reading the report of his inquiry.
Parliament has yet to approve the Prosecutor's resignation.
Lucenka accused activists of pressuring the investigation and leaking important information, making it difficult to identify those responsible for the murder of K. Handziuk.
Bill Gates has introduced the waterless toilet
In presenting the futuristic toilet, Bill Gates compared the transition from traditional toilets to waterless toilets to the computer revolution of the 1980s.
Microsoft founder Bill Gates has unveiled a high-tech toilet that doesn't need water from pipes at a trade show in Beijing, Reuters reports.
The waterless toilet operates on the principle of separation of solid and liquid waste.
Both types of waste water are processed into chemical fertilisers.
"The technology you see here is the greatest advancement in sanitation in 200 years", quotes Bill Gates from Bloomberg.
The tech toilet was built with the help of a charitable foundation founded by Bill Gates and his wife, Melinda.
The Foundation spent $200 million on a seven-year project to turn human waste into fertilizer or water.
In all, Bill Gates said, about 20 toilet models were created.
The device is now complete and available for sale.
But to make these toilets mass-produced, the Gates Foundation is willing to spend another 200 million.
According to the Gates Foundation, poor sanitation causes the death of 500,000 children under the age of five each year.
The fight against poor sanitation, such as cholera and other diseases, is increasing health spending, which has reached $233 billion.
To illustrate the sanitation situation that needs to be improved, Bill Gates has a toilet presentation with a glass of feces.
He says that this is a good reminder that in a small sample "there may be 200 trillion rotavirus cells, 200,000 bacteria that cause infectious diseases, 100,000 worm parasite eggs".
S. Slyva elected as President of the Football Association
On 5 November, an extraordinary meeting of the Lithuanian Football Association was held in Kaunas, where Sergei Slyva was elected as the new president of the organization.
An extraordinary general meeting of the members of the association was convened following the request of Anatoli Stecenko to resign as President of the association.
It was attended by 13 out of 15 members.
The main issue on the agenda was the election of a new President.
The election was contested by two candidates, Sergei Slyva and Vaidot Rastens.
Eleven members of the association voted for Mr Slyv, two members voted for Mr Rasteni.
Mr Slyva will complete the term of office initiated by Mr Stecenko, which runs until January 2021.
Anxiety in France: Concern over the deaths
French health officials announced on Monday that they have permanently banned a widely used pesticide, amid concerns about dozens of recent poisonings in the west of the country.
The ANSES Health Agency announced that the decision to ban all pesticide meth products was taken following a new safety review launched earlier this year, at least three months before the wave of poisonings that began in the departments of Maine and Loire in September.
The government had already suspended the use of the pesticide because of these cases.
This soil disinfectant should not come into contact with plants or farm workers.
The product must be used in large quantities to be effective.
In France, about 700 tons were used annually.
At least 70 people, including many farm workers, complained of eye and throat overload and breathing problems in the Anze region, which is rich in lettuce.
"These episodes confirm the correctness of our decision, but they did not precipitate it", Francoise Weber, deputy director of ANSES, told the newspaper Ouest France on Monday.
Metham, one of the most widely used pesticides in the United States and Europe, is considered by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to be a "probable human carcinogen".
This pesticide, marketed under the names 'Vapam' and 'Sectagon', is authorised in Europe until 2022, when a new safety review is due to be carried out.
"There was no choice but to take it off the market, regardless of whether there were alternatives", Weber told the newspaper.
"We understand the challenges that will be faced by lettuce growers, by the farmers in general, but public health is more important", she said.
Farmers have already expressed dissatisfaction with the government's decision last month to halt the use of methane in a region whose economy is heavily dependent on intensive agriculture.
The region near Nantes produces more than half of the 35,000 tonnes of lettuce consumed in Europe each year.
Next season will see "much less lettuce, peas and potatoes", Philippe Retiere, head of the Nantes breeders' federation, told AFP after the government stopped using methamphetamine last month.
EUR 70 million invested in a shopping centre with a shopping arcade in Tallinn
The new T1 shopping centre, which is being opened next weekend in the Estonian capital, has been developed with an investment of EUR 70 million by local real estate development company Pro Kapital Grupp.
The development will have a total area of 130,000 m2 or 55,000 m2 of leasable space, with 150 shops offering services or entertainment, and more than 30 cafes and restaurants, according to the developer's announcement.
In comparison, the total area of the Vilnius Acropolis (including office space) is about 110,000 sq. m.
T1 is the first shopping centre to have a rooftop observation wheel, according to the developer.
It will be operational early next year.
In addition, international transport ports will also be integrated into the area: trams will be parked next to the station and intercity buses will soon be on the route.
The main terminal of Rail Baltica is also under construction nearby, and is expected to serve 1 million passengers per year by 2026.
Paolo Michelozzi, CEO of Pro Kapital Grupp, says that the global shopping centre business is undergoing fundamental changes and that T1 has managed to stay ahead of them.
"We've created a next-generation shopping mall that offers an emotion and an experience that is not available online.
It is a place of attraction in the city centre, a gateway for travellers, an impressive and worthwhile sight to see, and at the same time a quality time spent with friends or family", Michelozzi was quoted as saying in the press release.
High Attention to Entertainment
According to the manager of the shopping centre, T1 also has the largest entertainment and discovery centre in the Baltic States.
The total area of the entertainment complex is 12,000 m2, or one fifth of the total area available for rent.
The highlight is the observation wheel on the roof.
It will lift guests to a height of 120 metres above sea level - higher than only the TV tower in Tallinn.
The tour will be followed by the Super Skypark on the fourth floor, which will open the largest shoe centre in Europe and the first basketball and netball courts in Estonia, the company says.
The SkyLAB Interactive Research and Discovery Centre promises to keep children occupied for at least five to six hours.
The entertainment complex will also feature a 360-degree 4D cinema.
In addition to the regular cinema in the six halls, visitors will be able to experience a virtual reality cinema with interactive 7D cinema.
In addition to the visual effects and the motion-picture chairs, the feel of reality is enhanced by the effects of the wind, rain or snow, as well as by the scents, smoke or smoke of the cinema.
According to the developer, the opening of T1 is expected to increase Estonia's tourism revenue by EUR 13 million per year, attracting over 300,000 visitors.
Pro Kapital Grupp is listed on the Nasdaq Baltic Exchange and also on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange.
Last year, the group generated sales revenue of EUR 1,8 million in Lithuania and suffered losses of EUR 350,000, according to Pro Kapital Grupp's financial report.
In 2016, sales revenue of almost EUR 9 million and a net profit of EUR 2,4 million were generated on the Lithuanian market.
The T1 shopping centre was built by the Estonian company Merko Ehitus.
Cameroon's President Paul Biya sworn in for a seventh term after controversial elections
In a ceremony presided over by parliament speaker Cavaye Yeguie Djibril, Biya, 85, pledged to preserve the "unity and unity" of the West African nation.
Africa's oldest president, who has ruled his country for 35 years, was declared the winner in the October 7 election, with 71 percent of the vote.
However, the election was marred by low voter turnout, violence and suspected fraud.
On the eve of Mr. Bias' inauguration, 79 students and three school staff, including the principal, were abducted from a Presbyterian school in the North West region, where English-speaking separatists are waging an armed campaign for independence.
The majority of Cameroon's 22 million inhabitants are French-speaking, and one fifth speak English.
In 2016, the North West and the neighbouring South West province began to demand autonomy following dissatisfaction with alleged discrimination in the areas of education, justice and the economy.
In 2017, Biya refused to relent and the radicals declared an independent state, the "Republic of Amazonia", and took up arms.
According to NGOs, at least 400 civilians and more than 175 security forces have been killed in separatist attacks and government retaliatory operations this year.
More than 300,000 people have fled the violence, some across the border into Nigeria, but many forced to live in the desolate forests.
In October, only 5% of voters in the North West region voted, compared with 15% in the South West province.
In both parts of the country, Mr Biya won two thirds of the votes.
Conservative primary: mistakes caused by non-examination
"There were some areas that were missing - you understand that the party organized everything with its own resources.
Some municipalities have allowed us to use their premises, but there were no polling booths everywhere because we cannot buy them ourselves.
Thank you to those who lent", said the politician.
He claimed that complaints were received but that their content did not change substantially and that the infringements themselves were not malicious.
"It was a challenge.
Not all the people who voted were experienced - it was new to them too.
So not all the actions from that test matched our schedule.
Therefore, the CRC had to warn that the principles we have described would be followed.
These complaints do not give any reason to doubt the results,' said Mr Anušauskas.
According to the Chairman of the CRC, there have been cases where ballots were not stamped and when they were found, the unmarked ballots were annulled.
In some municipalities, there was a shortage of seats, but according to Anušausko, the complaints and violations related to several dozen newsletters.
"Well, since the difference is a few thousand, it's really a substantial difference in the election results that doesn't do it", explained Anušauskas.
It is reported that the participation of party members in the elections reached 55%, while the participation of non-party voters reached 69%.
Both candidates had 400 observers and 600 people working in committees.
The results announced on Sunday also remain unchanged: 79% of voters voted for the winner, Ingrid Simonytė (16,418 votes), while 21% voted for Vygaud Ušacka (4441 votes).
On 17 November, the TS-LKD Council officially endorsed I. Šimonytė's candidacy in the presidential elections in May of the following year.
Trump says he probably won't meet Putin in Paris.
White House National Security Adviser John Bolton said earlier that Trump will meet with Putin in Paris, where events will be held this week to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the end of World War I.
But on his way to the last rally before the US midterm elections, Trump told reporters he wasn't sure if it would be a good opportunity to meet the Russian president.
"I'm not sure if we'll meet in Paris.
Probably not", the president of the United States noted.
However, the White House chief added, they will meet at the G-20 summit and "probably meet many times" after that.
Trump continues to try to "recharge" relations with Moscow despite allegations of Russian interference in the 2016 US presidential election.
Kęstuty Strup requests that the ECJ decision be annulled
Kęstutis Strupas, former director general of Vilnius University's Santaras Clinic, asks for the annulment of the decision of the Supreme Service Ethics Commission (SCEA) - which recognized that the transactions not declared in time were in violation of the law.
Mr. Strup's complaint was heard by the Vilnius District Administrative Court on Tuesday.
The decision will be published on 26 November.
The applicant claims that the decision of the ECJ of 23 May is annulled, as announced by the BNS by the representative of the Court, Sigita Jacinevičienė Baltaduonė.
Mr Strup believes that gifts to relatives should not be declared, he argues that he understands the exception in the law.
In May, VTEK announced that the then dismissed Director General of Santara Clinics, K. Strup, and the head of the Ambulatory Rehabilitation Department of the Vilnius University Hospital, Silvija Strupienė, had violated the provisions of the law governing the declaration of private interests.
The investigation revealed that four transactions were declared without the due dates: a loan taken from a bank with the spouse in 2010, a purchase of securities from a bank in 2017, a gift of an apartment to the daughter in 2017 and a loan granted to a natural person together with the spouse in 1996 and not repaid.
Strupienė also declared these transactions after the deadlines.
Persons who have infringed the law on the coordination of public and private interests in the civil service may not be promoted for one year.
The law requires that you declare not only your own data but also that of your spouse.
The investigation was carried out by VTEK on the basis of information from Info TV.
It is necessary to ascertain whether Mr Strup and his wife, S. Strupienė, head of the Ambulatory Rehabilitation Department of the Vilnius University Hospital, have properly and timely declared their transactions.
Last year, according to Info TV, Mr. Strup donated a property worth 125,000 euros to his daughter.
However, the former head of Santara Clinics and his wife did not mention this information in their declarations of interest.
Strup has been indicted by the Prosecutor's Office along with at least 10 other individuals in a corruption investigation, which the police believe is disguised as support for the illegal financial remuneration demanded from companies for the purchase of public computers and software in clinics.
In this way, Mr Strup is suspected of having made at least five allegations during the public procurement in the field of information technology at the Santara clinics.
Mr. Strup himself denies any wrongdoing.
Professor K. Strup, suspected of corruption, was dismissed from his position as head of the Santara clinic in September.
The decision of the Ministry of Health and the Vilnius University to terminate the employment relationship with Mr Strupov at his own request.
He has been in charge of the hospital since 10 November 2013.
Professor Juozas Raistenskis continues to lead the Santara Clinics on an interim basis until a competition for a new CEO is held, which is expected to be announced later this year.
Greetings from the Head of State on the occasion of the anniversary of Mr Gutausuks
According to the head of state, L. Gutauskas combines religious, historical and philosophical metaphors, eternal values, and opens the millennial wisdom and memory of the nation to the whole of art.
The author's beloved and appreciated work - poetry, prose, children's literature, painting, book illustrations - testifies to L. Gutauská as a multi-talented and awarded artist.
The President congratulated the artist on the occasion of the honourable anniversary and thanked him for his significant works that enriched Lithuania and wished him inspiration, happiness and success.
They want to teach differently in schools: less tests, more practice.
The Ministry of Education and Science is planning such changes in educational content, after introducing them at the forum "Change in educational content: foreign experience for solutions in Lithuania" held in Vilnius on Monday.
Speaking at the debate, Minister of Education and Science Jurgita Petrauskienė said that over 30 million euros have been invested in updating educational content over the past ten years, but no results have been seen.
"According to the results of the international PISA, students' achievements are below the average in OECD countries", said Minister of Education and Research Jurgita Petrauskienė.
The OECD expert Phil Lambert, quoted in the Ministry of Education and Research report, said that Lithuania was too focused on the provision of knowledge rather than on the practical application of knowledge.
According to him, in Lithuania, general education programmes pay great attention to the literacy, critical thinking, respect and responsibility of students, but it is also necessary to develop children's creativity, entrepreneurship, financial literacy, empathy.
In presenting the changes in the general educational content, Deputy Minister of Education and Science Gražvydas Kazakevičius said that the number of programmes to be updated this academic year will be smaller, more specific and the disciplines will be more closely linked.
According to the Vice-Minister, the education of pupils will be more individualized, schools will become more autonomous - they will be allowed to prepare between 10 and 30% of their unique educational content, the current system of evaluating pupils will change to a cumulative score, more weight will be given and the competence of the learner acquired informally.
Small standardized tests.
The common training programmes are promised to be a digital, user-friendly, e-resource-related task bank.
The aim of the updating of the curriculum is to improve pupils' achievements in the international PISA survey by at least 10%, to reduce the achievement gap by one third, to provide pupils with modern skills in school and to provide them with literacy in various fields.
Lithuania plans to allocate EUR 7,8 million from the European Union and the State budget for the updating of training content from May 2018.
It is envisaged that the updated draft general education programmes will be tested in some schools in the academic year 2019-2020 and will be implemented in all schools from September 2021.
In early October, the Ministry received criticism over the nearly €8 million project by the Centre for the Development of Education to update the general programmes for primary, primary and secondary education.
The four-year budget is €7.8 million, and the first call for proposals for training programmes, worth €1.3 million, was announced in early October.
After the experts criticized the purchase, it was suspended, and Minister of Education and Science J.Petrauskienė dismissed the Director of the Centre for the Development of Education, Giedrių Vaidelė.
Lithuania - Exercises on how to respond to extreme flooding
Lithuania will begin a 10-day exercise on Monday to improve the authorities' response to extreme flooding.
As reported by the Fire and Rescue Department (PAGD), the exercise will check how public authorities are prepared to work in the country after a state-level emergency, such as a flood, to eliminate its effects, coordinate the search, rescue and emergency evacuation of people from flooded areas, organize their supply of drinking water, food, ensure the necessary energy supply and provide other measures to protect the population.
The exercise will involve more than 100 representatives from all ministries and other institutions in the country, as well as members of the emergency operations centres of 12 municipalities.
On 5-13 November, the preparation phase of the exercise will take place, during which the municipalities, which received information from the Hydrometeorological Service from the PAGD about the incessant rainfall and the onset of flooding, will take decisions on the management of the emergency situation.
The active phase of the exercise is scheduled for 14-15 November.
The Department will be run by the State Emergency Operations Centre, while the State and municipal authorities will be run by the Institutions' Emergency Operations Centres.
Following the Government's declaration of a state-level emergency for the effects of the floods, the Chief of Operations appointed by the Prime Minister will lead the emergency response, mitigation, protection and rescue operations for the population and property.
The Deputy Director of the SDC, Mindaugas Kanapickas, says that the most important aspects of the exercise are to check the readiness of the institutions to carry out the functions provided for in the legislation, to assess the possibilities for exchanging information, to check the readiness to warn and inform the population, state and municipal institutions, bodies and enterprises about the impending disaster, and to "improve the skills of state authorities in managing emergency situations".
The exercise will also demonstrate the joint capability of Lithuanian, Latvian and Estonian firefighters to pump large quantities of water from flooded areas.
The Baltic FloodCombat module was set up in 2009 for this purpose.
Resignation of the Prosecutor General of Ukraine Yuri Lucenka
Ukraine's Prosecutor General Yuri Lucenka announced his resignation on Tuesday in parliament over the outcry over the death of acid-laden anti-corruption activist Katerina Gandziuk, according to the Ukrainian news agency Unian.net.
According to Ukrainian law, the Prosecutor General must submit a resignation request to the President of the country, who must submit it to the Verkhovna Rada for approval by a majority of votes.
On Tuesday, the Prosecutor General, J. Lucenko, presented the progress and results of the law enforcement investigation into the murder order of K. Gandziuk to the Supreme Council.
In his speech to MPs, he described the investigation as effective, but expressed outrage that the death of Gandziuk was being used for political public relations.
Gandziuk was a Ukrainian anti-corruption activist who spoke publicly about police corruption in her hometown of Kherson in southern Ukraine.
On July 31, outside her home, an unknown assailant, K. Gandziuk, sprayed acid on her face.
She died in hospital on November 4 from her injuries.
Protesters outside the Ukrainian Interior Ministry demand answers on who killed Gandziuk, AFP/Scanpix quotes.
According to Mr Lucenko, the investigation by the authorities has 12 individuals who may have been involved in ordering the murder of Mr Gandziuk.
However, one of the most likely versions of the investigation has been leaked to the media, which threatens the success of the investigation.
The Attorney General said that the leak gave the suspects essential information.
Mr Lucenko added that he knew Ms Gandziuk personally and was angry that some politicians were using her blood for public relations.
"So that no one can say that someone is obsessed with power, I am hereby resigning.
I will present it to the President of Ukraine today and you will have to discuss it in parliament,' quotes the newspaper Obzrevatel as saying.
It is reported that Mr. Lucenko added that "a country cannot tolerate a dual system, where the justice system is broken without any evidence, even for exposed crimes".
He is considered a close comrade of President Petro Poroshenko.
He was appointed Prosecutor General on 12 May 2016 following prolonged attempts to remove his predecessor, Viktor Shokin, from the post, suspected of covering up corruption of high-level officials and politicians.
Minister of Energy J. Vaičiūnas meets with representatives of Orlen Lithuania
The Commission also notes that the Commission has not yet decided on the amount of the aid.
According to the European Commission (EC), transport is the only sector not currently following the trajectories set out in the national renewable energy action plans at EU level, with a share of renewable energy of 6% in 2015.
The Commission considers that progress towards the mandatory 10% target in the transport sector is rather slow due to various difficulties, including the relatively high costs of reducing greenhouse gases and unclear regulation.
Renewable energy in this sector is mainly derived from biofuels (88%), with electricity playing a smaller role at this stage.
The Seimas has taken up the issue of the proposed corruption investigation to supplement the appeals of the conservatives to the KT
The Seimas on Tuesday approved a proposal registered by the head of the "state" Agna Širinskienė for an investigation into illegal influence on political processes.
The vote was taken by 58 members of the Seimas, with nine abstaining.
The draft will be considered by the committees of the Seimas, the main appointment being the Committee on Law and Order, headed by A. Širinskienė.
After receiving its conclusion, a vote will be taken on the adoption of an amendment to the resolution.
The Parliament's interim investigation commission, which is currently conducting a new investigation into political corruption, has been instructed to investigate possible illegal influence in 2008-2016.
Mr Širinskienė proposed extending this deadline, stating that 'significant information has emerged in the public space on possible unlawful influence and influence on political processes and state institutions'.
The draft lists 'potential representation of the interests of pension funds in the legislative process or by appealing to the Constitutional Court or attempts to influence the decision-making processes of significant independent bodies such as the High Commission for Ethics in Service'.
The appeal to the Constitutional Court on pensions was initiated by the opposition conservatives.
The ruling "nationalists" found that the Conservatives relied heavily on the arguments of private pension fund lawyers in their appeal.
The leaders of the "countries" of the influential Supreme Committee on Service Ethics (SCEE) accuse former comrade Povil Urbsh.
According to them, the former chairman of the State Administration and Municipalities Committee of the Seimas could have ordered the members of the VTEK to dismiss the former head of the Prevention Section of the commission, Mindaugas Siauri.
At the end of September, the Sejm set up a committee to investigate the possible illegal influence of interested persons or groups of interested persons, the impact on the electoral process, coalition formation, parliamentary groups, the work of individual politicians, the activities and financing of parties and social movements, the legislative processes, the election and appointment of members of state-owned enterprises, public bodies, management or supervisory bodies.
It is also suggested to inquire what information law enforcement and intelligence authorities have provided to the competent authorities and how they have responded.
The researchers should submit their findings by 1 May of the following year.
The campaign for the European Parliament will take place at that time.
Seven of the 12 members of the Commission are representatives of the 'countries'.
The Commission also appointed two social workers, one "Torgkiet", a liberal and a representative of the Lithuanian Polish Electoral Action-Union of Christian Families.
The Conservatives and the Social Democrats refused to participate in the work of the Commission.
The new investigation was initiated by the chairman of the ruling Lithuanian Peasants and Greens Union, Ramūnas Karbauskis.
He claimed that the investigation by the National Security and Defence Committee (NSDC) at the last session on essentially the same issues showed that the investigation needed to be continued.
The head of German internal intelligence lost his job
The 55-year-old Maassen has fuelled the controversy by claiming that the "radical left" in Merkel's coalition is to blame for his troubles.
As a result, he was not transferred to another post as previously promised, and was forced to go into reserve.
In fact, it was revealed last weekend that at a meeting of representatives of European internal intelligence agencies in Warsaw a few weeks ago, H. G. Maassen criticised Merkel's "naive" immigration policy.
Horst Seehofer, the German interior minister who has long defended the intelligence chief, said at a press conference on Monday that Maassen's recent comments were unacceptable and "personally disappointing".
Seehofer, who was under pressure both because of the dispute and because of his party's poor performance in the Bavarian local elections, asked President Franz-Walter Steinmeier to release Maassen into the reserves.
A shark attack has terrorized the island, killing a third person
The Queensland Ambulance Service said the victim suffered "severe injuries to his leg and wrist" in an attack near Sid Harbor, a seashore island off the coast of Queensland.
The man was taken to hospital by helicopter.
Sekmin Island is the largest of the archipelago of the same name, attracting many diving and surfing enthusiasts from all over the world.
Shark attacks in this region have been relatively rare.
On September 19th, a woman was attacked in Sid Harbor, and the next day, a 12-year-old tourist was attacked in the same bay.
The last time a shark attack occurred before the last attack in this hall was in 2010.
The CoR has two new members, Viscount and Pux.
Mr Puks was nominated as a member of the Board by the Lithuanian Bar Association.
He will replace the Law Society's delegate, Dreamy Winterfell, who has resigned from the CLC.
Mr Justice E. Visconti has been nominated to the Board of Appeal on the basis of the proposal of the Law and Justice party.
This party has no representative in the PSC since Donat Laurinavičius resigned.
In a secret ballot, 74 members of the Seimas supported the candidacy of Mr Puksa, 5 were against, 6 members abstained.

Naked Girls Destroy the Stereotypes of Wedding Dresses
Naked girl in white bloated bridal dress - mission (not) possible?
Can a white pigeon floating toward the altar be larger than S or M and still look attractive?
The participants in the reality show "The Evolution of the Big Dipper" will prove today that the beauty and elegance of a bride really do not depend on a woman's weight.
But that's not all. One of the girls on the project is going to shed tears of happiness tonight when her boyfriend shows up on the set.
"Some people think that bigger girls don't attract attention or looks from boys.
It's just a myth - my boyfriend is an athlete himself, but he likes me the way I am, he doesn't expect me to be a standard figure", Aurika, a contestant on the show, will say before the performance in the wedding dress.
A wedding dress is not easy, in every sense, a dress is a complex construction, it has a lot of materials, the dress is heavy, it is not easy to move.
Some women also feel that a bigger girl in a white dress will look bigger and thus less confident.
I can assure you that a well-chosen dress model will certainly solve this 'problem,'" explained one of the show's judges, fashion designer Robert Kalinkin.
The girls' fate is decided by R. Kalinkinas together with the whole committee - plus the fashion house opened by Erika Vitulskien, photographer and social media star Nagli Bierancu and TV producer Laura Paukšte.
"There's a lot of friction between the judges when it comes to deciding which girl should leave the show, because we're all from different backgrounds and we have different ideas about who's going to win the show.
And what made the wedding dress demonstration even more difficult was that -- and I can tell you now -- there were two new ones that were definitely no worse than the old ones.
It was a special night in every way", says Kalinkin.
The newcomers - Eve, who at 23 years of age became famous for her scandalous behavior on a summer reality show, and Dovile, a 31-year-old mother of two children of exceptional beauty - were among the other girls who participated in the "Great Evolution" selection and made it to the top 20.
Unfortunately, after the first very open photo shoot of the girls in the streets of Vilnius, they had to say goodbye to the project.
The girl was brought back to the show by LNK viewers, who voted for her favorite on the TV portal.
The international beauty reality show is already in its second week in Lithuania, where plus-size girls compete for the title of the first plus-size star in the country.
So far, there are only eight of them left, and they all know that there can only be one winner.
The intriguing and unpredictable reality show "The Evolution of the Big Dipper" is starting this week at 8:30 p.m. on the LNC.
Actor I. Elba voted the sexiest man in the world
People magazine in the United States has named the sexiest man in the world this year.
He was 46-year-old British actor Idris Elba.
Although the man claims that the news was unexpected when he spoke about the new title, he did not take the joke.
I thought, "This can't be happening!
Are you serious?"
And then I looked at myself in the mirror and I thought, yeah, I look sexy today, and I laughed, and I said, "Hey, I'm a good actor".
To be honest, Idris said that the title was a very pleasant feeling that had eaten away at his ego.
The British star says he was often subjected to harassment and abuse, which made his childhood difficult because, as he describes himself, he was "very tall and unpretentious".
The young actor was unreliable with his peers and became the object of a lot of attention, both because of his rare and unusual name and his African heritage.
"I just grew a mustache and muscles and became the hottest guy in my neighborhood", Idris smiles.
When her husband loses his big screen reputation, Elba works as a disc jockey at parties in Spain, particularly in the bustling city of Ibiza.
In his spare time, he enjoys Thai boxing and has a fashion sense that he realizes by creating his own clothing line.
The British actor says that his family is the most important thing in the world, so he plans a wedding with his fiancée Sabrina Dhowre.
Elba has been voted the 33rd sexiest man alive by People magazine.
In 2017, the title went to Blake Shelton.
Man beaten to death during a drinking party in the district of Shirvinta
A man was beaten to death during a drinking party in the village of Šalkišky on Monday evening in the district of Širvinit.
According to the Vilnius district police, at 9:16 p.m. a report was received that a man had beaten a neighbor during a drinking party.
When the doctors arrived, they found the man, born in 1943, dead.
A 1994-born suspect was arrested with a D.U.A. of 2.53.
Police are investigating the circumstances of the incident.
No longer requires 20 km for the construction of waste incineration plants
The Vilnius cogeneration plant is being built near Gariunius market.
The authorities no longer intend to keep the incineration plants within 20 kilometers of the settlements.
The head of the Environmental Protection Committee, Kęstutis Mažeika, registered an amendment to the Waste Management Law in the Seimas on Monday, denying such a requirement.
According to Mr Mažeika, the 'national' faction, which had previously supported the 20 km distance provision, promised to support the amendment on its rejection.
The amendment to the Polish Mining Act provides that from January 2019 waste incineration plants may be constructed in accordance with the requirements of the legislation on environmental protection and public health.
He acknowledges that the amendment has raised the President's doubts about such a ban.
'It is clear from the definition of residential area that it would be almost impossible to find a site where the above-mentioned buildings could be built,' says the chairman of the committee.
The ruling majority in October opposed the president's veto amendments to tighten the construction of waste incineration plants.
In addition to prohibiting the construction of waste incineration plants within 20 km of settlements, the amendments provided for the permission for the Government to take decisions on the future of the two power plants already under construction, taking into account the public health interests.
Mr Mažeika does not propose any adjustments to the latter.
In Vilnius, the energy group "Lithuanian Energy" is building a waste-to-biomass power plant, and in Kaunas, together with Fortum Heat Lietuva, a company of the Finnish energy group Fortum.
The latter already incinerates waste in Klaipeda.
There is talk of a possible compromise in the Brexit negotiations
The leaders of the United Kingdom and Ireland discussed a possible compromise on Monday to resolve the complex issue of Northern Ireland that has plagued the Brexit negotiations, Dublin said.
In a telephone call, British Prime Minister Theresa May offered the possibility of reviewing the so-called safeguard mechanism agreement, which would allow the UK province of Northern Ireland to remain open to the Republic of Ireland, which is part of the European Union.
Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar promised to consider the proposal but rejected any possibility of Britain unilaterally withdrawing from the deal, the Irish government said in a statement.
In the interview, Mrs May 'has raised the possibility of reviewing the hedging mechanism', it said.
'The defendant has indicated that it is open to a review of new proposals, provided that the outcome of such a review does not involve a unilateral decision to terminate the application of the safeguard measures', the government said in a statement.
Brexit negotiators are unable to find a viable solution to avoid checks at the UK-Ireland land border when Britain leaves the single market and customs union in March next year.
The two parties agree on 'safeguard measures' to keep the border between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland open until a larger trade agreement is signed to ensure that no additional customs checks are carried out at the border.
The EU wants Northern Ireland to continue to comply with EU customs rules, but London wants them to be applied temporarily to the whole of the UK.
The Daily Telegraph reported on Monday that Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab is seeking Britain to withdraw from the bailout deal unilaterally in three months.
However, Varadkar told reporters in Dublin that his government "cannot support it".
'Three-month or limited-term hedging instruments are not worth the paper they will be written on,' he said.
London and Brussels have previously refused to confirm the breakthrough in Brexit negotiations following the report that a deal was in the pipeline in Britain over the weekend.
"I would say we are still making progress in the negotiations, but there is still work to be done", said May's spokesman in London.
European Commission spokeswoman Margarita Schin also told reporters: "We are not there yet".
Nobel Laureates call for access to reliable information
A group of eminent thinkers, including Nobel laureates, issued a declaration on Monday calling for the right to reliable information in the Internet age.
Among the 25 signatories to the International Declaration on Information and Democracy are economists Amartya Sen and Joseph Stiglitz, Iranian lawyer and human rights activist Shirin Ebadi, winner of the Nobel Peace Prize, and Nobel Prize for Literature author Mario Vargas Llosa.
"We urge leaders of goodwill on all continents to take action to strengthen democratic models and open public debates where citizens can make decisions based on facts", the group said in a statement.
They argue that the 'global information and communication space' is a common good that 'must be protected in order to strengthen freedom of expression and opinion'.
'People have a fundamental right to information which is freely collected, processed and disseminated, based on the principles of truthfulness, pluralism of approaches and rational methods of fact-finding,' the authors of the declaration added.
The document asks for the help of world leaders, including US President Donald Trump, who is often critical of "fake news" but regularly accused of distorting facts.
The signatories called for world leaders to express their position on the issue when they gather in Paris for the Paris Peace Forum on 11-13 November.
The declaration was prepared over a period of two months under the direction of Mr Ebadi and Christophe Deloire, the head of Reporters Without Borders (RSF), a Paris-based organisation for media freedom and the rights of journalists.
Other signatories include former Senegalese President Abdou Diouf (Abdu Diuf), Chinese lawyer and human rights activist Teng Biao and political scientist Francis Fukuyama (French).
Seimas approved higher fines for harmful products
The Seimas approved amendments to the Law on Product Safety, which provide for increased fines for product safety violations.
The shoes were adopted unanimously in the Chamber.
As Antanas Vinkus, member of the Seimas Health Committee, said about the new project, it is welcome that the objectives set are related to better consumer protection of products.
In addition, its provisions are adapted to the requirements of the Decision of the European Parliament and of the Council.
"My head, in the proposed bill, is more fully and specifically distributed to all the actors involved in the supply and distribution process: manufacturers, service providers, importers, distributors and others.
As practice shows, the current system of fines does not always prevent further infringements, as entities that have paid fines continue to commit repeated infringements,' said Mr Winkus.
The project was prepared by the Ministry of Agriculture and after the Government's approval, the Economic Committee of the Seimas supplemented it with its proposals.
The amendments aim to increase fines for infringements, strengthen consumer protection, give more power to market surveillance authorities and create a clear system for monitoring the requirements for product safety and compliance.
According to the Ministry of Agriculture, there is currently no obligation for producers to properly label the product to ensure its traceability.
In addition, according to the Ministry, market surveillance authorities are not granted access to the premises, buildings and premises of producers and suppliers to carry out inspections in the course of the state control of product safety, which complicates the work of the authorities.
The Ministry considers that the six-month period for imposing fines and warnings is too short to identify the infringement, investigate and impose a fine.
The Ministry also stated that the penalties imposed are not sufficiently effective.
The Commission notes that the Commission has not yet established the existence of a significant number of such infringements.
The Ministry of Agriculture proposed to impose an obligation on manufacturers to properly label the product and thus ensure its traceability in order to facilitate the clarification of non-compliant suppliers by the market surveillance authorities.
It is also proposed to give market surveillance authorities the right to access, in the context of state controls on the safety of products, the premises, buildings and premises of operators who produce or supply products on the market.
The fines for violations of the law are to be increased.
The manufacturer, importer or authorised representative who places dangerous goods on the market and the distributor who places them on the market, the provider of dangerous services or the provider of dangerous services would be fined between EUR 150 and 2 500 (currently between EUR 144 and 1 448).
A decision by the State Consumer Protection Authority (SPCA) or another market surveillance authority to prohibit the placing on the market and supply of dangerous products or the provision of dangerous services would result in a fine of between EUR 1 000 and EUR 5 000 (currently between EUR 868 and EUR 4 344).
Failure to comply with the requirement to withdraw dangerous products from the market, recall them from consumers and destroy them would result in a fine of between EUR 2500 and EUR 6 500 (currently between EUR 1 448 and EUR 5 792).
If dangerous products cause harm to the health of the consumer, a fine of between EUR 2 500 and EUR 15 000 (currently between EUR 1 448 and EUR 11584) would be imposed.
If the dangerous products caused the death of the consumer, a fine of between EUR 6 500 and EUR 25 000 (currently between EUR 5 792 and EUR 23 169) would be imposed.
According to the Ministry, in Poland and Austria, infringements of product safety legislation are punishable by fines of up to EUR 25 000 (no minimum fine), in Belgium by fines of between EUR 26 000 and EUR 600 000, in Romania by fines of between EUR 155 000 and EUR 6 666, and in Bulgaria by fines of between EUR 125 000 and EUR 7 500.

The Norwegian armed battalion has participated in the most remote and harshest NATO exercises
Soldiers from the Norwegian Armed Forces have been taking part in a series of complex exercises in the mountains north of the capital, Oslo.
This is part of NATO's Triangle Connection 2018 exercise, the largest NATO exercise since the end of the Cold War.
Most soldiers in the 2nd Battalion of the Norwegian Armed Forces after the 9/11 terrorist attacks spent a lot of time away from home in places like Afghanistan - that is, in warmer countries.
But they are best suited to warfare in Arctic conditions, and their skills are especially useful now that NATO is shifting its focus.
In recent days, soldiers have been engaged in staged battles against real British soldiers in the mountains east of Tyneside, often in the most remote and harshest of places.
Soldiers have the skills to survive in the cold, wild environment, but in harsh climates they must carry much more weight - about 50 kilograms [50 kg] per suitcase.
Soldiers in command say they share their skills in surviving and fighting in these conditions with other NATO soldiers.
The soldiers say that this exercise, which is like no other, will teach them to be ready if a serious threat arises.

It is worth mentioning that this was Huddersfield Town's first home game of the season.
After the 11th round, Huddersfield Town are in 18th place in the league, with Fulham last at 20.
The retired Kaunas deputy does not plan to return to politics
Former Kaunas deputy Povilas Mačiulis, who left his job in the municipality and the organization "Veniendo Kauno" in the presidential elections for supporting Vygaud Ušacku, does not plan to return to politics and promises to focus on business.
"I'm going to focus on business.
I'm a shareholder in several companies, and I have ideas for new projects.
Most importantly, I will be able to enjoy the opportunity to spend more time with my family", Mačiulis told BNS.
He also said he had no plans to run in the upcoming municipal elections.
Mr Mačiulis has not yet had the opportunity to speak with Mr Ušack after losing the first election of the Patriotic Union-Lithuanian Christian Democrats to Ingrid Simonite on Sunday.
"To be honest, we haven't had a chance to discuss the results in detail with him and the team and discuss our plans for the future.
It is obvious that this stage of my life is over with Vygaud's withdrawal from the next election campaign", said Mačiulis.
He said he did not regret the decision to abandon Kaunas policy in favour of Mr Ushack, but regretted that 'Lithuania had lost the unique opportunity to have a real leadership in the context of international relations'.
In 2011, Mačiulis briefly served as the deputy mayor of Kaunas, and later returned to this position after the successful election of "One Kaunas" in 2015.
He is a shareholder of Erudito Liceius, a private school, and several other companies.
The workers in Kaunas are plunging: what are they doing here?
When the people of Kaunas saw the workers at Kaunas castle, they were hopeful that the restoration work on the tower was finally underway.
Kauno City Museum Director Gabrielius Suziedelis told kauno.dagen.lt that the southwest tower was undergoing a roof replacement.
The interlocutor said the roofs will be tin.
"The emergency can cover was a threat to the environment - people could fall over and get hurt - and it had to be replaced.
The roofs were no longer moisturizing, and so the heritage was also damaged", explains the museum director.
Will these roofs be the same as they were centuries ago?
"All the work is coordinated with heritage and other institutions", added Mr Suhrievel, "to make the result as authentic as possible, but there is also an important and practical aspect - the roofs must protect the valuables from moisture.
A universal solution has been chosen for heritage management.
Before that, the elements of Kaunas Castle were covered in Soviet times, so they no longer had historical value", explained the director of the Kaunas City Museum.
The employment contract was signed on 2 October.
The works are planned to last no longer than three months from the date of signing of the contract.
"We hope to have it finished by the end of November", the museum director said with anticipation.
According to him, the value of the work carried out is almost 24 thousand euros.
According to the interlocutor, this amount was provided for in this year's budget.
The work at Kaunas Castle is carried out by Statia.
Kauno. dag.lt has written that according to the research done, Kauno Castle could have looked earlier.
US and South Korea renew naval exercises
A two-week naval exercise involving about 500 troops will now take place in the southern city of Pohang, Seoul's Defense Ministry said.
The United States has 28,500 troops stationed in South Korea.
The two countries have been preparing joint military exercises for years, which Pyongyang calls "provocation" and "preparation for invasion".
North Korea threatened on Friday to restart its nuclear program unless Washington lifted economic sanctions on Pyongyang.
Such a change of course may be "seriously under consideration", the North Korean Foreign Ministry said.
US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said in a television interview that sanctions would remain in place until Pyongyang renounces its nuclear weapons.
He also announced that he would meet with North Korean envoy Kim Yong Chol in New York this week.
Maxima is expanding in Bulgaria - Business news
The largest retailer in the Baltic States, the Maxima Group, is expanding in Bulgaria, where it operates a chain of stores under the T-Market brand.
The company's CEO, Edwin Volk, told the business publication Capital that it would open two more stores by the end of the year, bringing the total to 74.
According to Volko, next year it is planned to open 7-10 more stores in Bulgaria.
The company recently opened a new concept store in Sofia, T-Market Express, with an investment of EUR 1 million.
The "social zone" is open 24 hours a day, and you can use the Internet for free, charge your smartphone, and buy sandwiches, salads, and other dishes.
According to Mr Volko, 2018 will be the first year in which the company will end with a positive profit before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA).
Mr Volck forecasts that Maxima Bulgaria's revenue will grow by 40% this year to EUR 158,5 million.
Last year, the company generated revenues of EUR 113,3 million.
The Maxima Group has been active in Bulgaria since 2005.
Last year, the company entered the top 10 retail chains in the country for the first time.
The Maxima Group, which is controlled by the Vilniaus Handel group controlled by Nerija Numavičius, intends to invest around EUR 200 million this year and next year, mainly in Poland, where Maxima has acquired the retail network Stokrotka.
The group operates the retail chains Maxima and the e-food store Barbora in the Baltic States and Stokrotka and Aldik in Poland.
The Commission notes that the measures in question were not implemented in the context of the restructuring plan.
The Centre for Eastern European Studies will collaborate with two prominent US "brain centres"
According to the Vilnius-based and thirteen-year-old head of RESC, Lino Kojalla, the establishment in the US will allow the implementation of projects and make Lithuania's voice heard more on the other side of the Atlantic.
"We've been working toward this for several months.
I am pleased that the two large institutions see us as partners and are looking for opportunities to work together.
I have no doubt that niche activities will emerge, as the topics we are analysing, NATO, security, disinformation, the development of the Eastern Partnership countries, are also priorities for them", said Kojala.
The agreements specify that the RESC and the US authorities will work together in the preparation of international project applications, exchange of expertise and knowledge, and expert visits.
This should be particularly useful for Lithuanian analysts, as both partners have an excellent international reputation.
The FPRI has been in operation since 1955 and brings together almost 100 top-level analysts.
In a recent ranking of global think tanks by the University of Pennsylvania, FPRI was ranked seventh in its category.
Meanwhile, CEPA, whose analysts have been invited to consult and work with the highest US political institutions on several occasions, is ranked 10th in its category.
'This will give more opportunities for Lithuanian analysts working in various institutions to penetrate the US information space and will encourage us to raise the quality bargain,' added Kojala.
One of the first practical steps should be to help partners disseminate the soon-to-be-released RESC analytical publication Lithuanian Foreign Policy Review to US decision-makers and the public.
The Centre for Eastern European Studies operates on the basis of ongoing projects and does not receive targeted grants.
The partners with whom the RESC implements joint initiatives include the European Commission, NATO, USAID, various international funds, etc.
Two buildings collapsed in Marseille
Two people were injured in the collapse of two buildings in the southern French city of Marseille on Monday, the fire service said.
As the buildings collapsed, debris and dust clouds rose onto the street.
Dozens of firefighters, some with trained dogs, were at the scene, near the famous old port of Marseille.
The local prefecture posted pictures on Twitter showing a pile of debris and logs, a large gap in the area where the buildings stood, firefighters working at the scene and cars covered in a thick layer of dust.
Officials said they're looking for people who might be under the rubble.
Marseille firefighters tweeted that two people were being treated for minor injuries.
A popular video shown by BFM-TV shows a cloud of dust on the street and people with their hands in their mouths.
Google Street View images taken before the incident show that one of the buildings collapsed was five stories and the other was six.
One of these buildings was clearly in poor condition, with overhanging windows and large cracks in the facade.
Sabine Bernasconi, the mayor of the Marseille district, said that one of the buildings was in poor condition and had been ordered to evacuate.
However, the mayor could not rule out the possibility that the building might have been used arbitrarily by the people who lived there.
The regional prefecture has urged people to avoid the area and clear the path for rescue services.
Sabine Bernascon, the mayor of the Marseille district, said that the building was in poor condition and had been ordered to evacuate.

Mexican restaurant helps U.S. deported migrants
The more Mexicans are deported, the harder it is for them to adapt.
"When I was deported, they took everything: my house, my car, my clothes.
They took everything except one thing - my knowledge", says Victor Hugo Hernandez, the restaurant's manager.
The restaurant's board hopes that the fusion of Mexican and American cultures will foster a better understanding between the two.
Afghan Special Forces member shot American instructor during training
Brent Taylor, the 39-year-old mayor of North Ogden, north of Salt Lake City, had taken a year-long leave of absence to serve a mission in Afghanistan.
He was a military intelligence officer at the Joint Chiefs of Staff, but he was due back to work for the mayor in January.
Another U.S. military member, whose name has not been released, was wounded in the attack that killed Taylor on Saturday.
According to the authorities, Mr. Taylor died from infantry gunfire.
Utah National Guard commander Major General Jefferson S. Burton told reporters that Mr. Taylor helped train and strengthen the Afghan National Army.
The Utah media quoted a NATO report that Taylor was shot by a special forces soldier and that the attacker was killed by Afghan forces.
Mr. Taylor had a wife and seven children.
His remains are scheduled to be flown to Dover Air Force Base in Delaware Monday evening.
He's done two tours in Iraq, and this was his second to Afghanistan.
In January, before leaving for Afghanistan, Mr. Taylor told local media that he had been assigned to a team of advisors and instructors from one of the country's special forces battalions.
Thousands of North Ogden residents gathered in the streets of the city of about 17,000 to watch their mayor and his family escorted by police.
Mr. Taylor became mayor in 2013.
