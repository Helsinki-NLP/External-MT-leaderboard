In addition to EU aid, national aid management will be concentrated on four life centres from mid-September.
In eastern Finland, the Southern Savona Life Centre in Mikkel is responsible for the activities.
The new Enterprise Act, which came into force at the beginning of July, states that EU structural assistance must no longer be directed to large enterprises unless it is a completely new activity.
Subsidiaries of municipalities with a population of more than 5,000 are also considered to be great lords.
On the other hand, EU support for investments in improving the conditions of local businesses can continue.
In Eastern Finland, the unit managing EU and national aid will have about 30 members.
At least for now, they all continue to operate at their current locations.
For example, the job of Kalevi Pölös, head of the Structural Fund Unit at the South Savoy Life Centre, is in Joensu.
This is what Russia is now working on in Ukraine
Russia is working consistently, even if it doesn't always seem so.
The head of the Department of Strategy at the National Defense High School, Lieutenant Colonel, Professor Torsti Siren, was not surprised by the conflicting news of Ukraine on Monday morning.
Siren says this has been the same thing for a long time.
On the other hand, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov demanded an immediate ceasefire and announced that Russia would not attack Ukraine (see more here).
On the other hand, Ukraine says that its paratroopers are currently fighting with a Russian tank division near Luhansk airport and that the tank division has received reinforcements (read more here).
Lavrov insisted that the Minsk negotiations should lead to an immediate ceasefire without conditions.
Russia denies its involvement and must immediately reach a negotiated conclusion in order to secure their position in Luhansk and Donetsk.
That's the whole point, siren says.
This is the big picture: we must urgently negotiate, and in particular, that Russia gains its own control over the regions of Luhansk and Donetsk.
Finnair outsources travel services to a Norwegian company, fires people
Finnair will begin to purchase passenger services as a subcontractor from Norwegian crew services company OSM Aviation.
The agreement will cover Finnair's routes to Hong Kong and Singapore at an initial stage, but it is planned to be extended at a later stage.
The two routes will result in a total reduction of about 100 years of workforce in Finland, which will be implemented in the first phase of the holidays, the company said in its communication.
In addition, about 80 Asian hired workers will be laid off when the routes are outsourced.
Finnair already announced in June that it plans to outsource around 20 routes of passenger services over the next two years.
The outbound was the result of a lack of agreement with staff on savings.
The outreach is scheduled to begin in January-March next year.
The company also said that the negotiations on cooperation with other partners are continuing.
Studies show that sleep problems multiply the risk of spinal cord pain or stroke in those who work heavy shifts.
The occupational health agency's study followed firefighters for 13 years.
The link between sleep disorders and stroke is surprisingly strong, although many other factors were taken into account.
The good muscular strength and endurance of the firefighters, which are regularly tested, do not appear to protect against pain, says the study's lead author, Professor Sirpa Lusa, in a press release from the Institute of Occupational Health.
Firefighters work irregular shifts, with shifts that can last up to 24 hours.
The Agency for Occupational Health and Safety states that EU problems are common in this type of work.
The results are based on a survey carried out in 1996, 1999 and 2009.
Do you know the surprising new causes of water damage?
They can easily damage other homes.
Water damage Water damage is not always caused by a leaking pipe or a leak, as an expert in the management association reminds us.
We have been contacted after the breach of the aquarium caused water damage to the house company, as to whether it is possible to ban aquariums, says Marina Furuhjelm, legal expert at the management association.
Furuhjelm points out that not only are pipes and sewers a common cause of water damage, but also that today more and more new machines such as icebreakers have caused water to flow into homes.
Many do not realize that machines such as a dishwasher or a laundry machine cannot be left unattended.
The water supply shall also be kept closed whenever the machine is not on, as otherwise the pressure in the pipe may lead to water leakage.
The resident may be considered guilty of negligence if these obligations have been neglected and the resident is liable for damages.
Of course, in these cases, home insurance can compensate for the damage, depending on the terms and circumstances of the insurance.
If it can be shown that the resident has caused the damage by negligence, the resident shall be liable for compensation.
If the inhabitant has fallen to the floor of the shower, the failure can often be proven, as in these cases the water has flooded elsewhere and the caretaker comes to the apartment where the fallen inhabitant is found.
Furuhjelm reports that due to the prevalence of the closure of flooring, many student apartments now have two flooring rooms installed in the shower rooms.
Water damage has also been caused by water beds, although not as much as it was when they were more popular.
Even a dog's water cup and falling into a cottage wine can cause real water damage.
I also know of a case where there were many cats in the apartment who had pissed on the floor causing extensive damage, Furuhjelm says.
The principle of corrective responsibility always applies in the same way unless otherwise provided for in the company's Articles of Association.
The shareholder is responsible for repairing the surface material and the housing company for structural damage and other damage to the dwellings.
Water damage can easily cause damage to other homes because the concrete in the structure absorbs water very easily.
According to Furuhjelm, the battery leakage of homes is particularly difficult because batteries can easily leak into structures.
Water damage can be caused by the widespread use of air heat pumps that produce condensed water.
Water should lead to a solid sewer or rainwater network, not just a container.
The shareholder's responsibility is also to remove water, snow, ice and debris from the balcony, advises the legal expert.
Furuhjelm points out that while the rules of the household undertaking do not require, for example, a fixed removal route for the washing machine, there may be a condition on the insurance that prevents compensation for this reason.
You should be careful with your home insurance policies.
However, I consider the disconnection of washing machines, such as bathroom drainage pipes, to be a major risk, causing many damage.
I recommend that the drainage is always directed firmly to the sewer pipe.
Removal of snow and water on the balcony
Control of washing machines, case washing machines, etc. when they are on.
Closing of the sink (washing machine and dishwasher)
The floor cleaning is visible twice a year.
The recommendation is to connect the drains to the sewer firmly.
Check for hairs and possible leaks
Regular melting of the freezer
Do you have any experience with water damage?
Tell me about your experience in the comments.
FC Honka lost again and went to the series.
At the Tapiola sports bar, on Sunday night, the football coach of the Super League faced the two weakest teams at the moment.
The last June's victory was won by FC Honka, who hosted the seven-match Vaasan Balloseura, which was played in a winless pit.
VPS just took their last win against Honka in July.
Sunday's game with the Espoo team came to a good halt as VPS returned to a long-time winning record of 2-1.
The Vaasa team's head coach Olli Huttunen complained about the inefficiency of his team before the game, but the confused Honka defense eased the VPS's painting problems.
A playfully highly nervous performance.
We didn't get any longer attacks at all, we didn't get to hold the ball", Huttunen said.
In the first half, the top two in Hong Kong, Milos Milovic, Kosta Manev, played very uncertain.
Both of these vassala paintings were born out of the loose gambling of the toppers.
The opening scene of the game was only seen five minutes after the game when Steven Morrissey led the way past the shooting of Sebastian Strandvall by the insane Honka goalkeeper Walter Viitalan.
It's a shame about the first half.
"The team did the opposite of what was agreed before the game", said Hong Kong head coach Shefki Kuqi.
After the first impact, the Spaniards got their game together and rolled the ball in the attack.
The first was the fact that the club was not able to take the lead in the first half.
The closest to the painting was the Hong Kong midfielder Jussi Vasara, whose shot from 20 metres, however, went slightly beyond the VPS lands.
The VPS effectively attacked using its rogue attackers and Hong Kong's mixed-up top couple.
At half an hour, the Vasales had a 2-0 lead, with Morrissey and Cornelius Stewart making their way through the field.
Morrissey served and Stewart finished.
Morrissey was in the opening period with a good game and he repeatedly created situations on his left side.
Stewart's speed, on the other hand, seemed too fast for the Espoo defense throughout the game.
"I shouted at halftime that if we lose, we'll lose with honor", Kuqi said.
In the second episode, the angry Honka was furiously asking for a painting.
The team was twice close to hitting the field until the third attempt was successful.
The attacker Yerai Vilaboa has completed the goal in the middle of the penalty area.
After Vilabo's goal, Hong had half an hour to tie the game.
The Espoo team took more risks, which gave the VPS the opportunity to counter-attack dangerously.
Both Stewart and Morrissey made it to the top once with the Reference, but the wireless fights of the Honka field guard kept the home team in the game.
By the end of the game, Honka was a little tired and couldn't get any more waves.
With the loss, Honka finished last in the Super League with seven games left in the series.
The newspaper: Putin threatened to take Kiev in two weeks
Russian President Vladimir Putin was quite busy in a telephone conversation with EU Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso, reports Italian newspaper La Repubblica.
Putin expressed his anger at the European Union's plans to tighten sanctions against Russia.
If I want to, I can take Kiev in two weeks, La Repubblica says Putin said.
According to the newspaper, Putin's message to Barros was this: "We should not irritate Russia with new sanctions".
Putin gave an interview on Russian television on Sunday night about the Ukrainian crisis.
Putin said in an interview that he considered the conflict entirely internal to Ukraine and urged the Kiev government to negotiate directly with the rebels.
At the same time, he warned Kiev strongly against setting fire to civilian targets in eastern Ukraine.
Russia "cannot look away" if people are shot dead from close range, Putin said.
Esko Roine admits that the actor's work destroyed his family
Hard work as a Conker actor and theater crowd raised him to admit how his acting career ruined his first marriage.
Actor Esko Roine turns 70 next Friday, but I think the saying goes for him that age is just a number.
I don't see any difference from a year ago or two years ago or ten years ago.
Esko Roine says mental puberty seems to be ongoing.
Roine's been retired for years, but he still pushes his buttons in front of a lot of men.
Sometimes they joke that there aren't many plays in this country without Esko Roinet.
Currently, Roine has roles in the Helsinki City Theatre's play How to Succeed Without Really Getting In Business, the Tampere Working Theatre's Mindset Editor and the Tampere Comedy Theatre's Quartet.
Roine will also be seen in the upcoming film, The Crossroads.
The following is a list of the events that happened in the year 2000:
Roane's acting career didn't start out promising.
I wasn't good enough for the baby-sitter thing at school.
Forty to fifty years later, the teacher said it was because I was so bad.
Esko Roine was not disappointed.
The choice was clear. There was no choice.
It felt close and loving.
I was so in such a hurry to get into the field that I left school and volunteered for the army just to get into drama school as quickly as possible.
Roine has done about 200 theatrical roles and 300 TV shows, depending on how you count.
If you count the numbers like the English, that every episode of a TV show has its own show, there are over 600 TV episodes.
I was three years old at New Day, which was three episodes a week.
The other spring, I was killed when I didn't have time to do it.
Commitments for Autumn 2016
Eila, 83, and Liisa, 76, are in full swing, playing fierce roles as anarchist idiots in the play Still Time at the Tampere Working Theatre.
Little brother's gonna be on the lounge for years.
That's what it looks like now, but you don't know about this guy.
I always have to make a little reservation. I'll come if I'm alive.
Some commitments have been made or promised.
The calendar has reservations for the fall of 2016.
Years have left a mark on this man.
Age doesn't come alone.
Her knees are operated on, her hip is whistling and her jaw is broken, but if you don't let it get too much involved, they'll get it, says Esko Roine.
Roine was introduced to the television audience.
The pirate radio and other shows where he and Antti Einio shared the satos, the 100 marks.
It was Antti Einio who distributed the satos.
I was trying to make it sound like a hundred, not a hundred.
In the series, Roine was the infamous Iron Curtain.
He became a favorite of the police in Tampere when a police officer with the same condition happened to be on duty.
A policeman pulled up the car on the street, pulled the window open, and yelled at me, "That Iron Man is brilliant!"
The task force succeeded
Roane's been thinking about theater, and all that.
The Producer and Master Class of the Helsinki City Theatre, the death of a merchant traveler at the Tampere Working Theatre and the Long Day Trip to Night at the Tampere Theatre.
The thing about all of this is that the shows have been popular.
It's not because of me. It's because the task force succeeded.
It's been a long time coming.
The role of the Beek Tree in the movie is one of those.
There are others.
It's because I've agreed too easily.
I don't know if I regret those roles, but the end result is not me, and it's not going to satisfy the audience.
You know, as a dirty actress, you can't choose your own work.
It's just been done nicely as ordered.
Alongside her theater work, Roine has also tried to make it in business.
In the 1980s, he ran a restaurant in Tampere called Wanhat Roomeot.
It was a learning experience.
It was nothing when I tried to be the manager, actor and then restaurant manager of the Tampere Theatre at the same time.
If I remember correctly, within a year, it turned out that these things could not be reconciled by anything.
Typically, when the show was coming to a close or on hold and I was already thinking about turning on the sauna, the restaurant called and said that there were some of your friends here who were hoping to see you after the show.
Memories for the Birthday
On his birthday, Esko Roine will be featured in a memoir, written by ghostwriters Annika Grahn and Eija Mäkinen.
They've created some kind of disgust from the memory of the face-taker.
I mean, back in the day, when I was playing at Zoom, they called me a face-lifter.
I didn't know them by that name.
It's been in the works for years.
Roine once said that no news bombs were allowed because he had never done anything so terrible, or if he did, he wouldn't tell.
I made a little introduction to the book.
I'm saying that if anyone is waiting for scandalous revelations or good gossip, they should stop reading this.
There's a lot of professional time there, both as an actor and a theater director.
The editor is also complaining that there's a turnout of a dirty playboy.
It was a pretty normal student life, but I'm sure you'd be able to do all sorts of tricks.
It wasn't as wild as it was back in the Turks.
It was very different.
I don't know how much of it I got from it but the confidence that once school is over, you know that at least it's not up to you if you don't get better.
I didn't have to think about how good I would be if I went to school.
Roine also recalls the legends of the National Theatre.
I became friends with Pentti Siemex, Tarmo Mann and Hannes Häyrisen and got to work with them.
There were legends about my first servant, Carlo Halttus.
Pia Hattara and I had a very close relationship.
Tauno Fire was already gone, but I got to know him when I was in high school.
The middle-aged son of the fire, Marty, was in the same class with me.
At the theater school, Roine met his first wife, Marjukka Halttus.
It's a sad thing she remembers her divorce.
After a relatively long struggle, the children were divided.
Not in two parts, but in the way that the daughter went to her mother and the son to me.
I didn't think it was a good idea, and I understand that children are pretty much in agreement now that they're adults.
In the theater circles, it's not uncommon for silver to be divided.
In our case, part of it was that I worked a lot at the time.
I was in the theater almost every time.
Then there was the TV and the radio on it.
I had a long day and my family was in pain.
On the day of the party, maybe free.
Esko Roine is celebrating at the Tampere Workers' Theatre at the Mindset Repairer on 7 September.
The celebration will continue at the Helsinki City Theatre on 21 and 28 September.
The psychoanalyst is also there.
I was in my 50s and I was in my 60s.
When this easy-to-make play happened, I thought we'd keep the 70s, and get them out in one run.
Roine says there's no party cost on the actual birthday.
It's free, as far as I can remember, but I'm not going to take the oath.
I might have booked some stuff for that day.
Or maybe it's a weird night off that I'm gonna have on my own, says Roine.
Airline concerns about the production chain
Some UK smaller aircraft manufacturers are concerned that supply chain manufacturing capacity problems may derail the ambitious plans of large aircraft manufacturers to increase passenger aircraft production.
In the United Kingdom, thousands of companies in the aircraft production chain are currently enjoying an unexpectedly large number of aircraft and engine development plans being implemented simultaneously.
Air and Defence
While some enjoy the order volume, warnings have been issued about the capacity problems and price fluctuations in the production chain.
It is true that price stability is present, especially now that production volumes are challenging says Craig Gallagher, CEO of MB Aerospace, one of the leading suppliers of aircraft engine manufacturers such as Rolls-Royce.
According to David Bailey, CEO of the North West Aerospace Alliance, a supplier of aircraft manufacturing supplies to some 240 North West England countries, more capacity is needed.
Are the strategies and investment plans consistent with these growth plans?
I'm not really sure, to be honest.
We need, above all, more investment in the new production equipment and machinery needed to achieve these volumes of production', Gallagher says.
Some companies claim that the simultaneous implementation of new production plans and the increase in aircraft construction are part of the problem.
Andrew Churchill, CEO of JJ Chrurchill, a gas turbine wing producer, said the company was facing a "difficult time" as several new construction plans were launched at the same time at the beginning of the year.
We have moved from very low production in the blink of an eye to a state where production capacity has been exceeded.
Many orders were paid later, and we also had to try to keep moving forward.
However, it is useless to try to explain that the problem is due to the simultaneous implementation of new production plans', says Churchill.
J.J. Churchill has responded to the challenge by investing £800,000 in new machines and hiring 26 new employees.
Many operators believe that further investment and coordination between small suppliers is needed if the UK is to maintain its position as the second largest operator of the airline industry after the United States.
Geoff Ford, chairman of Ford Aerospace and a Tyneside-based fine-mechanical engineer, says the order booking should increase the confidence of producers and the desire to expand and increase production capacity, as there will be enough work to do.
"If this doesn't happen, we'll lose the competition to other countries", Ford says.
Some major players are trying to solve the problem by acquiring capacity.
Senior, an aircraft and engine component manufacturer in the FTSE 250 Index, purchased parts from Malaysia-based aircraft manufacturer UPECA for £75 million.
MB Aerospace bought companies in North America and Poland last year.
It is possible to buy start-ups that are new to the business, but in reality the most production is slowed down by limited design and the number of engineers, says Gallagher of MB Aerospace.
Both small and large companies have mentioned the price quotations that have been passed on to them from the large aircraft manufacturers and aircraft engine manufacturers.
Some believe that the problems of the operators in the production chain are being exaggerated.
Marcus Bryson, head of GKN's aircraft manufacturing unit, who also acts as the UK air traffic representative, and ADS's chairman, believes that the production chain has addressed the issue better than in previous seasons.
There's a lot of pressure in the supply chain, but I wouldn't describe it as critical.
The introduction of new technology and advanced processes is more important than volumes, says Bryson.
Both Airbus and Boeing have learned from their mistakes and are now more careful not to increase building volumes too quickly.
In its attempt to increase production in 1997, Boeing ran into serious difficulties as the company lost and factories and production chains struggled to survive.
Tony Wood, head of Rolls Royce's aircraft manufacturing unit, says the company has not yet encountered any problems in the production chain, which supplies most of the 18,000 parts needed to make the engine for the jet.
It will certainly be a thorough process, but we believe we have done a more thorough work on the supply chain by selecting the best partners and keeping in touch with suppliers as they prepare to expand operations, says Wood.
According to Boeing CEO James McNerney, the company's production chain has had time to prepare for increasing supply volumes.
We have a good sense of the strength of the production chain.
We have been open to the press, which is very important.
The Commission also notes that the Commission has not yet established a specific target for the A350 model, which is to be used to assess the impact of the new A350 on the airline's business.
Maybe one of the journalists will not succeed, and our task is to try to prevent this situation and to support the journalists and to look for alternatives, but there are serious problems to be faced, says Brégier.
Bregiér says that Airbus is not looking for bribes: The quality of the production chain is the responsibility of the main supplier.
So this is my job and Airbus's.
Hong Kong protest groups start an era of non-combatance by banning open elections in Beijing
China refuses to grant Hong Kong full democracy
Pro-democracy activists are spreading through the streets of Hong Kong after China rejected their demands for open elections.
Hong Kong's pro-democracy groups stress that protests can be marred and vow to ensure that the city begins an era of "non-citizenship" to oppose the reforms proposed by the Chinese government.
Thousands of protesters were challenging the impending rain against the glittering skyline of Hong Kong as they marched in front of the premises of the law enforcement council on Sunday night to protest the pro-democracy group Occupy Central, where protesters urged people to participate in a wide-scale sit-down to cripple the city's financial district.
The rally came just hours after Beijing announced it would deny voters the right to publicly propose candidates for the 2017 mayoral election, threatening months of protests that would further increase the city's two-year hiatus.
Protesters are taking part in the Occupy Central rally in front of the central government buildings in Hong Kong.
"We want fair and decent elections", says 24-year-old website owner Dion Tse, who took part in a demonstration on Sunday with her 50-year-old mother Wong Chi-yin.
The government doesn't respect the Hong Kong people's voices.
We want the government to listen to us and see the determination of Hong Kongers.
The Chinese National Congress, the highest legislature in China, has approved plans for election changes that will allow only two to three candidates to contest Hong Kong's first direct elections.
However, the nomination process requires the approval of a 1200-member nominating committee, which opposition politicians believe will effectively prevent a person with a different political view from getting on ballots.
Protesters took part in a demonstration organised in the context of the Occupy Central Love and Peace protest, held in Tamar Park in front of the Hong Kong government building.
Police estimate that more than 2,600 people are currently participating in the demonstration.
A large number of police followed as about 100 demonstrators led by the Scholarism student group gathered late on Sunday in Grand Hyat, where Communist Party member Li Fein was scheduled to stay overnight after arriving in Beijing.
Benny Or, one of the founders of Occupy Central, attended a press conference with members of the Alliance for True Democracy, Scholarism and the Federation of Students, among others.
Or, instead of following the law, he said an exact date for the road closure, but urged the participants to closely monitor the situation over the next few weeks, adding that the city is officially entering the era of non-census.
Or Benny, answering questions from the press.
"Look at the person next to you", he said at a demonstration on Sunday in front of a billboard showing a figure representing disobedience in China.
That man is going to rule the world with you!
Scholarism's 17-year-old schoolboy Joshua Wong said earlier that preparations for high school student protests were underway and that they were planned to be held at the same time that thousands of college students are expected to show their willingness to refuse to teach.
In addition to our academic responsibilities, we also have our social responsibilities, says Wong.
In Beijing, Li Fei, deputy secretary-general of the National People's Congress Committee, told reporters that defending international requirements for universal suffrage was a waste of time and would be based on some Hong Kong politicians who seek to confuse and mislead society.
Practical proposals such as the nomination of a public official have wasted a lot of time, Li says, demanding that the electoral system be created in a way that fits the real situation and legislative framework of each society.
The bill on universal suffrage can only be adopted in a lay way if a large majority, two thirds of the 70-member legislature in Hong Kong, supports it, which means that the government's 27 opposition members can stop the initiative.
Li warned that Hong Kong could be drawn into an extended political debate if the reform proposal is rejected by a veto.
It would harm business and urban development, he says.
Almost 800,000 people voted in an informal poll conducted by the Occupy Central movement in June to oppose Chinese demands that the candidate need approval from the committee.
Even 172,000 people marched for democracy on 1 July, at the same time as the pro-Beijing and anti-Occupy Central March on 17 August, attracted around 88,000 participants.
Three injured in a salamanca attack on a New York beach.
A salamanca attack on a New York beach resulted in three injuries.
According to the fire department, the men were injured on Orchard Beach in Pelham Bay in the Bronx on Sunday night as severe storms swept through the area.
The wounded men are in hospital.
The extent of the injuries is unknown.
The dark came as the heavy thunderstorms swept the city.
Storms, fog and fog interrupted the Labor Day weekend celebration and the U.S. Open tennis match in Queens, and forced the East River Island music festival to close early.
Dozens of commercial flights to the city's airports were delayed by bad weather.
The new idea is not to be liked
This is the latest web user guide for employees and managers, and it's shared by Harvey Schachter, a writer for Monday Morning Manager.
According to entrepreneur Seth Godin, it's a good idea to recognize comments like "I don't like it" or "I don't understand".
If not, the idea is probably popular and self-evident  so boring and everyday  or the benefits it brings are so small that they are not worth pursuing.
As a Harvard historian, Drew Gilpin never repeated anything he had already published so people wouldn't think he had nothing new to offer.
Now, as the dean of the college, he's repeating the same thing over and over again to get the message out there.
Advertising consultant Bob Hoffman believes that television and radio are the best tools for generating demand, while the Internet creates supply.
The fact that more and more people read the news online does not mean that the Internet is a good medium for advertising  just as the first telephone was a popular communication medium but a bad alternative for advertisers.
Psychologist Heidi Grant Halverson says that one word alone motivates employees: together.
In one study, participants were told that they solved the problem by cooperating, even though they were actually working alone in an empty room. These participants worked longer and solved more problems than participants who were not initially told about collaboration.

Mount Stuart Hospital's wound operations are banned for safety reasons
The specialist has been temporarily removed from his post and the NHS in the United Kingdom stopped referring patients to the private hospital for stitching after problems with the hospital emerged.
Two people were admitted to Torbay Hospital for first aid after being treated at Mount Stuart Hospital in Torquay.
Torbay Hospital in Devon has said it has contacted 19 patients on 26 July and invited them for an emergency clinical trial.
Mount Stuart Hospital apologized for the incident and said that the matter had been investigated since the doctor was discharged.
The matter came to the attention of Torbay Hospital when two patients treated at Mount Stuart called for first aid for eye problems.
According to Torbay Hospital, none of the 19 NHS patients who were all examined on the same day had to undergo repair surgery.
The Torbay Hospital and the South Devon and Torbay Hospital District have not directed patients to Mount Stuart after the onset of problems.
David Sinclair, interim chief executive of the South Devon Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust, which runs Torbay Hospital, said that we had identified the problem at its early stages and were able to contact all the patients concerned quickly.
Whenever we refer patients to a healthcare provider, we conduct quality and safety tests and ensure that the provider meets the latest legal requirements and that its licensing matters are in order.
According to Gill Gant, Director of Patient Safety at South Devon and Torbay Hospital, Patient safety is always a top priority, so it is important that these operations are not performed until we can be fully confident that the treatment is safe.
Ramsay Health Care UK, the hospital's operator, apologized sincerely to all patients who had suffered complications.
The company was informed that when we learned of the potential problem, we and later Torbay Hospital called all the patients involved.
This specialist has been licensed by Ramsay Health Care since 2005 and has been a registered doctor since 1989.
To date, he has performed 4,537 surgeries in various parts of the organization, statistically showing excellent clinical results, with a complication rate of less than 0.5%.
Mount Stuart added that the doctor has been temporarily removed from his position until further notice.
What is 4chan?
An anonymous social networking site has published the first leaked nude photos of celebrities
What exactly is 4chan, and why was it the hacker's first choice when he published stolen images?
4chan was founded in 2003 and is a controversial communication site that is both hailed and praised.
The site is divided into several sections, including a notification table, where anonymous users can discuss everything from video games to travel to pornography and hacking.
Unlike other online forums, users do not create a single, continuous profile and their publications are not kept.
In the most popular ad tables, comments may disappear in less than a minute when new publications remove them at the bottom of the page.
These two factors have created a chaotic, anarchist and surprisingly creative atmosphere for the 4chan.
Anonymous Community members have created some of the network's most well-known meems (such as rickrolling and lolcats), but the lack of rules on the site has also led to a lot of questionable or even criminal content on the site.
The most popular ad tables on the site are /b/ for mixed discussions and regularly feature NSFW content (Not Safe For Work).
This could include summer porn, but also raw and shocking images, which an anonymous hacker posted stolen images of celebrities on this particular billboard this weekend.
CytRx , an American company , invests in cancer research and development .
CytRx's goal is to cure cancer  or at least slow it down.
A Los Angeles-based biopharmaceutical company recently hit a major stock market crash specializing in cancer research and development.
The most promising drug is aldoserubicin, a more advanced form of the commonly used drug in chemotherapy.
CytRx is conducting clinical trials to treat aldoxorubicin soft tissue sarcomas, AIDS-related Kaposin sarcomas and recurrent glioblastomas or brain tumors.
It is like a guided missile that goes directly into the tumor rather than any other organ", says Steven Kriegsman, CEO of CytRx, a cancer drug for aldosoroubins.
Aldoxorubicin contains a so-called combination technology that acts like a Trojan horse.
It binds directly to the protein in the blood, which also accumulates in the tumors, and then the drug travels directly to the cancer cells.
I've only been able to deliver the drug in an acidic environment, which is cancer cells, but not in healthy tissue.
This technology allows the patient to receive more and more doses of cancer drugs.
"It's like a missile going directly to the tumor, not to any other organ", says Steven Kriegsman, CEO of CytRx.
Like many other biotech companies that focus on developing drugs, CytRx is not profitable.
The company sold shares this year, raising $86 million for operations and research.
CytRx is currently seeking 400 patients worldwide for a crucial 3-stage clinical trial in alternative therapies for soft tissue sarcoma.
Soft tissue sarcoma is a type of cancer that develops in soft tissues of the body, such as blood vessels, muscle and adipose tissue.
Alternative treatments are used to treat cancer when the original treatment does not produce results.
If the clinical trial is successful, CytRx plans to seek approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration as early as 2016, Kriegsman says.
The drug could then be approved for use in 2017.
Analysts say that data from a previous CytRx clinical trial published in December showed that aldoksorubicin is a promising treatment for soft tissue sarcoma.
For a long time, the question was "how much clinical data we have seen about how different it is from the drug itself", says Andrew Fein, an analyst at H. C. Wainwright & Co. investment firm.
The publication of the results confirmed the opinion that this treatment is different.
However, Fein says that it is difficult to predict the results and timing of the current clinical trial because it differs significantly from the previous study, which had good results.
"There's a lot of things that have to go right", he says.
I'm comparing the development of medicine to the mining industry.
"First, a lot of money is invested in finding that one gold coin, and the investment continues as long as that gold coin is found", he says.
The money will be spent on research and development for as long as the drug can be commercialized.
Several shareholders have sued CytRx because they believe it gave a better picture of their success.
The complaint alleged that the company hired the investment firm DreamTeam Group, which it claimed then hired people to write positive comments about CytRx and another biotechnology company on such sites as Forbes, Seeking Alphan, Motley Fool and Wall Street Cheat Sheet.
The complaints claim that the articles did not reveal that the companies paid the writers fees.
As a result of the news, Seeking Alpha announced that it had removed articles that were unconstitutional.
Several articles on the company were also removed from other websites.
Kriegsman declined to comment on the charges.
The company has hired an outside lawyer to handle the lawsuits.
"I don't have the time or energy to focus on this", Kriegsman says.
He said the real challenge for CytRx is to find talented workers who are usually looking to work in biotechnology centers like San Diego, San Francisco and Boston.
"This is in many ways a desert from the perspective of the pharmaceutical industry", he says.
The views of Analyst
CytRx's stock price rose to $8.08 on January 10 and then dropped to less than $3 in April when the allegations of advertising the shares came to light.
According to Analyst, the lawsuits and negative publicity have reduced the price of the shares to below their actual value.
It is unfortunate, says Fein,but I am not sure if there is an easy way to get around this as long as the concept is valid.
In the name of the law, a police procedural cameraman was killed in the middle of the shoot.
The filmmaker of the reality show, also in Finland, The Law, died Tuesday night after being shot in the middle of a shooting.
A cameraman captured a gunshot between a police officer and a suspect in a fast food robbery when he was hit by bullets.
He died quickly of his injuries.
According to TMZ, the police said that in addition to the cameraman, the shooting killed a suspect in armed robbery.
One of the first reality television programs, Law & Order, has been broadcast in the United States since 1989.
The series has been broadcast on MTV in Finland since the 1990s.
The question of the outside actor will play a crucial role in the court hearing that begins today as Ulvia's death is being investigated.
Anneli Auer is charged with the murder of her husband, Jukka S. Lahde, in 2006.
The Court of Justice of Vaasa is now dealing with the case for the second time, as the Supreme Court has returned it to the Court of Appeal with new evidence.
The purpose of the court is to issue a verdict later this year.
The court of Vaasa released Auer in 2011.
The court then considered the possibility of an outside factor to be sufficiently probable.
In his opening speech, District Attorney Kalle Kulmala explained the prosecutor's view on the murder and the factors that rule out the possibility of an outside actor.
The crucial question we think is whether an outside agent has entered the house who killed Jukka Lahden in the manner and time Anneli Auer has told us.
It's about the credibility of Anneli Auer's story", Kulmala said.
The prosecutor said the murder began with a family dispute during which Auer had announced that he was leaving home and seeking divorce.
At some point, we moved into the kitchen, where the Latte held on to Auer and tried to stop him from leaving.
"Someone took the kitchen sink", Kulmala described Monday's events.
The prosecutor said there was a lot of evidence to support the fact that there was no outside agent.
For example, the emergency telephone system does not hear voices from outside.
Aure's eldest child, his daughter, said in an interview that she saw the perpetrator as he stepped out of the fireplace door.
The Court of Justice of the European Union delivered a judgment in 2011 based in part on the daughter's report.
The prosecutor said the daughter's statement could not be true.
"The daughter did not see the outside agent in her parents' bedroom, even though she visited it twice to see", Kulmala said.
The prosecutor's new witness is closely tied to the possibility of an outside perpetrator.
The sister of Jukka S. Lahde has reported on the events after the night of the murder in the hospital.
According to the woman, the only thing she told me at the hospital was that she only saw Lahda's body when she went to the scene in the fireplace.
The defence of Auer intends to present to the court the lines of investigation the police have not sufficiently clarified.
When the Vaasa Court acquitted Auer three years ago, the court wanted to find the DNA of a stranger as one of the clues to an outside source.
The sample later turned out to be DNA from a researcher working at the Central Crime Police Laboratory .
That's when we took a DNA sample from 700 people on a mass shooting.
At the same time, a significant number of serious suspects and alternative investigations were closed off", said defense attorney Juha Manner.
The second defense witness is a possible outside source.
The woman in Ulvialand told the police about a police officer who, according to her, confessed to the crime.
The police interviewed him last summer.
The prosecutor's office has ruled that the prosecutor has nothing to do with the murder.
The prosecutor requested an investigation because the prosecutor suspects that she lied about her report.
Another of the new Witnesses in the defense is a nurse who was working at the Central Hospital of the Church the night of his death.
The Circuit Court sentenced Auer to life in prison for murder last December.
The Court of First Instance held that the possibility of an outside actor was contested by the reports of the Auer children, the voices which were missing from the emergency centre list and the time required for the events to take place.
The verdict came in a 2-1 vote.
A minority judge wrote that in a criminal case, conflicting evidence must be interpreted in favor of the accused.
Therefore, the daughter's account must be interpreted as meaning that, despite the contradictions in the account, she had observed the outside agent leaving the fireplace door.
Aure's two eldest children have been summoned to the courtroom.
The daughter was first personally heard last year in the Circuit Court.
When he was in court, he had no memory of the events of the night of the murder.
Aure's second-oldest child named her mother a murderer in a 2011 video interview.
The boy told me that he heard the events of the night of the murder behind a locked door.
He also told me that Auer had been planning to kill him for six months.
As a lawyer, the boy has no obligation to testify in court.
The court hearing will resume today with the hearing of Anneli Auer.
The auer hearing will continue tomorrow if necessary.
Anneli Auer is currently serving a seven-year sentence for sexual and violent crimes against children.
Should Putin's participation in the G20 be allowed?
Putin's actions in Ukraine have made him the number one enemy.
Putin is due to attend the G20 summit in Brisbane in November, and there is a heated debate in Australia about whether or not to allow him into the country.
The punk rock group Pussy Riot demanded that Australia ban Putin from attending the summit, which will feature more than 4,000 representatives from the world's most influential nations, over the weekend.
"We do not think this person has anything to do with the G20", Maria Alyokhina told the audience at the Festival of Dangerous Ideas in a crowded Sydney opera house.
The European Parliament has also called for a new framework for the implementation of the European Union's policy on the protection of the environment.
Tony Abbott has said he's reviewing the decision.
Mike Callaghan, director of the G20 research unit at the Lowy Institute, said that Australians cannot decide who will attend the meeting, even if it is held in a country.
Australia can decide who it will let into the country, but this is an international meeting, he says.
Just as the New York City hosting of the UN meetings or the International Monetary Fund hosting of Washington, the role of the "host" is not to deny anyone an invitation to attend, says Callaghan.
Last week, Tony Abbott said he was suspending the decision after Russia's offensive actions in Ukraine.
This is a very important question.
As Putin is coming to a very important international meeting, Australia has no right to decide alone.
But there is an important point to be made, which I will ponder a lot, and I think other countries will do the same in the coming weeks.
People are attending an anti-war rally in Mariupol, eastern Ukraine.
The two-day event will feature a diverse group of representatives from the world's largest and fastest-growing economies, which together comprise about two-thirds of the world's population and account for 85% of global GDP and 75% of international trade.
Members include, for example, Canada, China, France, Japan, Russia, the United States and the European Union, as well as a few invited guests from non-G20 countries such as New Zealand, Singapore and Myanmar.
According to Callaghan, Australia was given a questionable task to balance the different interests under great public pressure.
He believes the prime minister's best approach is to use the opportunity to pressure Russia to speak publicly about its recent actions.
The Prime Minister should say that we will use this opportunity to pursue a very open dialogue and that he will demand that President Putin be held accountable.
If Putin comes to the meeting, it is his duty to give an account of his actions, Callaghan says.
We can see clearly that geopolitical pressures are increasing.
I think the world expects them to take these things up.
Russian-minded rebels are preparing weapons for an attack on Ukrainian military bases at Donetsk airport in eastern Ukraine.
It is still unclear whether Putin will attend the meeting, and Callaghan said this may not be known until a few days in advance.
This is the last thing Putin has in mind.
He hardly says that I have to change my attitude towards Ukraine because I want to go to Brisbane in November.
Opposition leader Bill Shorten is very reserved about Putin's arrival in Australia, but he understands that this is an international conference.
It is probably time for the Prime Ministers and Foreign Ministers to discuss with other states and the G20 countries whether it is appropriate to allow Putin to enter Australia.
This is an international conference, not an Australian conference, I understand that.
After the tragic events that followed the Malaysian Airlines crash, and the complete lack of compassion, responsibility and proper cooperation in the air disaster, and now that thousands of Russian troops are parading the Ukrainian border, I think most Australians will be very reserved to welcome Putin to Australia.
German business criticises Berlin for its "Zionist" ties
Some of Germany's top business leaders warn that Germany has become too confident and too united because the government's policies threaten the country's hard-won competitiveness.
The criticism of Chancellor Angela Merkel's government comes at a time when Europe's largest economy is showing signs of slowing down, raising concerns about its ability to drive growth in the euro area.
The criticism of business leaders is the result of the strong opposition of the German business sector to policy decisions, including the introduction of the minimum wage and the reduction of the retirement age of certain long-serving employees to 63 years.
I think the biggest threat right now is overconfidence in Germany, which inevitably creates a sense of self-censorship, says Kurt Bock, CEO of BASF, the world's largest chemical manufacturer, based on sales figures.
The EU economy
He is of the opinion that: 'In general, there is a feeling that we are doing well, that we have the money to spend and that unemployment is relatively low.
I think there's a real danger to this.
The policy of the German government shows that we are not focusing on growth and are not favourable to businesses, but rather we are focusing much more on sharing wealth and meeting the expectations of certain parties.
According to Markus Kerber, CEO of BDI, a German industrial organisation, the situation in Germany is now good.
However, in the next ten years every developed economy will have to change. ... [in Germany] the reform programme will not make as much progress as in previous years.
The National Chamber of Commerce (NCHC) has also expressed criticism of recent political developments.
Unemployment in Germany has remained low and the budget is almost balanced, and even once-slow consumption is rising again.
However, the falling GDP of the second quarter has highlighted the vulnerability of export-rich Germany to external shocks such as Russia and Ukraine.
GDP decreased by 0.2% in the three months preceding June compared to the previous year.
Germany's weakening performance threatens to make the ECB's fight against low inflation even more difficult and may make a quantitative recovery more likely.
Kerber hopes that the government will move from public spending to public investment, for example by focusing future spending increases on infrastructure rather than pensions.
Mr Kerber believes that the Merkel government is destroying the fruits of the strict policies of his Social Democratic predecessor, Gerhard Schröder, in the early 2000s.
According to Stefan Heidbreder, CEO of the Stiftung Familienunternehmen, a family enterprise foundation, Germany is still in a good position compared to other countries.
It is thanks to the corporations and not government policy. . . .
The example of neighbouring France has shown that using money for social support and restricting the freedom to run a business are wrong.
The leading German investment banker described the situation more directly, saying that the recent decisions of the government were "catastrophic".
Germany is threatening to lose everything it has worked so hard to do just to please the voters.
This is my main concern at the moment, says the banker.
Bock said that the energy reforms of the new coalition government failed to address the fundamental weaknesses of the policy which have caused the industry to suffer from competitive costs.
Ashton Kutcher handwritten at music festivals with security guards blocked from entering the fan
Actor Ashton Kutcher attended the Stagecoach Country Music Festival in Indiana, California, where he reportedly got into a fight with a security guard.
Ashton Kutcher is said to have been involved in a fight with a security guard at a country music festival.
Kutcher's fan tried to approach him backstage at the Stagecoach Country Music Festival in California, but the situation got out of hand, TMZ reports.
Kutcher was in the VIP room when a young woman approached him to say hello and shake his hand.
When the star of the men's half-hour show went to greet a fan, an overzealous security guard stepped in and caused a riot.
The actor and security guard got into a fight, and Kutcher's friends had to intervene to arrest Kutcher, TMZ reports.
After separating from his ex-wife Demi Moore, Kutcher is dating Mila Kunis, who is, like Kutcher, a former star of the '70s show.
The incident occurred shortly after Angus T. Jones was virtually removed as a regular cast member of the hit series after he posted a video calling the series "the "sniper" and urging fans not to watch it.
Actor Ashton Kutcher is attending the Stagecoach Music Festival in California.
Angus T. Jones, Jake, calls the series "Crazy" and tells people not to watch.
The Baltic Sea bacteria killed a vacationer
A Caribbean-based bacterium that has been found in a popular German tourist destination has infected six people.
One of the patients is in a coma.
Vibrio vulnificus is found in parts of the Baltic Sea and other parts of the world, but it is most commonly found in the Gulf of Mexico.
The bacteria are most effective in breaking up at over 20 degrees in the fracture tube.
Bacteria can be found anywhere, as long as the conditions are right, Dr. Heiko Will, director of the Mecklenburg-Vorpommern Health and Safety Agency (LAGuS), told The Local.
The bacteria is found in Denmark, Poland and along the German coast.
LAGu said the patient was on vacation on Usedom Island at the end of July.
He passed away in early August.
Another pensioner has been in a coma for three weeks, and it's possible that his leg may need to be amputated.
He went swimming near Ahrenshoop with a small wound to his foot.
The patient went to the hospital on the way home and noticed that his foot had turned blue.
Doctors found blood poisoning on the leg caused by the Vibrio vulnificus bacterium.
"My husband would certainly not have spent time in the Baltic Sea if he had known about the danger", Sonja Bruehl, a sick wife, told the newspaper Ostsee Zeitung.
The serious disease and the damage caused by blood poisoning to the patient and his family could have been avoided if information had been better available.
LAGuS told the dpa news agency that doctors had been advised to follow up on the infectious situation in early summer, but no official information was given.
The cool temperatures have reduced the risk of infection.
[Monday] results showed a significant decrease in the presence of V. vulnificus, says Dr. Will.
The cold weather's been a little rough.
Vibrio vulnificus, a relative of the cholera-causing bacterium, is particularly dangerous if a person already has chronic liver disease and a weakened immune system, such as in HIV or diabetes patients and the elderly.
Men are at higher risk of developing the disease than women because estrogen has been found to protect against pathogens.
If the bacteria gets sick, it causes blood poisoning and sepsis.
The chance of dying from the wound is about 25 percent.
V. vulnificus can also be infected by eating the marine life it contaminates, although Dr Will says that in these cases it is not an infectious organism.
Pollution of food from the sea is more common in the southern hemisphere.
In Germany, the last time the V. vulnificus bacteria caused poisoning was in 2010, when two people died from it.
Vieno Kekkonen: The breast was removed for cancer
The 80th anniversary of the discovery, singer Vieno Kekkonen is struggling and exercising vigorously, but she has also had to worry about her health.
It's amazing that the radiant Vieno Kekkonen is 80 years old.
He himself is surprised at how many years of such a life can suddenly be so many.
I never realized I was this old.
80 years sounds like a lot, Vieno Kekkonen laughs.
It's his birthday. Vieno Kekkonen is spending it with his family.
At the end of August, a birthday party was held for him by the National Music and Pensions Association in Karttula, where he spent his childhood.
We were on the stage at the Clock School, the same place my grandfather was born.
I was so excited about the party, the birthday hero tells of an occasion where a stage measuring 300 was filled with congratulators to the brim.
A few days later, Muhoksel was gathered to greet Armi Kuusela, whose life Vieno Kekkonen remembers following as a young man.
And now we're both this age!
Take the cake laugh.
In his long career, there are only a few parts of Vieno Kekkos that have not been seen in public.
One thing she's never told the public before: In 2006, she had her second breast removed.
I had a vague finding at a point where it was decided to remove it completely.
It wasn't cancer after all, which I was happy about.
The same surgery was done with a new breast, so it was a pretty big operation.
Vieno Kekkonen has not thought that he lost his own breast in some way for nothing, since knowing of the vague find would have been a heavy burden and cannot be left untreated.
I was just so relieved that nothing serious happened, says Vieno Kekkonen, noting that it is certainly harder for younger people to lose their breasts.

The farmer is being blamed for the sea
The discussion of the weak position of the Baltic Sea and its link to Finnish agriculture is depressing.
The voice of experts is immersed in political opinions.
In particular, the Helsinki Gazette and Yle have been raising the issue of agricultural responsibility for food emissions in the Baltic Sea during the summer.
The same breathing requires rapid action to curb emissions.
The average farmer has a few environmental researchers and their suppliers who are familiar with the subject compared to a superior nutrition expert.
The farmer knows that no food poisoning can come from cultivation if the same amount of nutrients are sown in the field as the crop.
In Finland, almost all farms are committed to the environmental programme.
It strictly restricts the use of fertilisers and requires strict monitoring and reporting of the nutritional balance.
The authorities shall monitor compliance with the conditions.
The nutrients stored in the pasture have been washed into the water even after the fertilisation restrictions, but even here, for years, emissions have been declining.
Farmers have the will and willingness to continue working to reduce their feed emissions.
However, everyone should understand that zero is impossible.
"If we want to have agricultural production that is roughly equivalent to consumption, we just have to accept that it is", says Jyrki Aakkula, Director of Environmental Studies at MTT (MT 29.8.).
Last summer, the Gulf of Finland experienced a massive wave of blue-water events.
Researchers were quite unanimous in saying that the rice was grown from the sea's own phosphorus reserves.
The phosphorus stored at the seabed is partly a product of the coastal countries' agriculture of the past decades, but it alone does not explain the stocks.
The clean-up of wastewater in the growing cities along the Baltic Sea coast was a major problem until the end of the 20th century.
The problem also affected the wastewater of Greater Helsinki, which was not seen as a problem as it was in terms of pollution of its own shores.
Pollution of the beaches was prevented by the construction of a sewage pipeline to the open sea in the 1980's.
Of course, the water quality has improved over the years.
The nutrients that have been lost to the sea in the past do not disappear even if agriculture is completely stopped in Finland.
Yet the ever-present debate and accusations are always about agriculture today.
The public debate has made the farmer guilty of the Baltic Sea.
The accusation is unreasonable, but it becomes more and more difficult when it is used to pursue political passions.
The Green Group, led by its chairman, Minister for the Environment Ville Niinistö, is pushing for major changes to environmental standards in agriculture.
As a board, he's used the summer break discussion.
It has thus strongly accused the producer organisation MTK of being aging and considered it the most difficult obstacle to water protection.
There should be a limit to political rhetoric.
Most specific water protection projects are based on specific cooperation between the CFP, farmers and the Environmental Administration.
Such an aggressive style of fishing serves more to fish for the sounds of urban greenery than to protect water.
I guess that's the point.
With hard talk, the Greens are preparing to leave the government.
In policy changes, the task of the MTK is to provide for the livelihoods of its members.
Farmers find it difficult to trade expensive changes unless a substitute is found at their expense.
The only money that Ville Niinistö has offered is cuts from other agricultural funds.
The mine is not going to be destroyed .
The latest attempt by the Abbott administration to dump a mining tax in the trash seems doomed, as Clive Palmer has announced that his senators will reject it without amendment.
The Australian Labor Party also fears that the government has included a new policy to limit increases in mandatory pensions for employers until 2034.
The government used a majority in the lower house of Parliament on Monday to speed up the dissolving process in the face of public confusion and a clear anger from the Labour Party.
It set aside the original motion for annulment, which had previously been substantially amended by the Senate, and replaced it with a new bill, which it described as relating primarily to taxes, pensions, social security and family benefits.
The initiative was originally intended to abolish the failed mining tax and other decisions such as the low-income pension ($3.6 billion savings), the income support allowance ($1.3 billion) and the bonus for school-age children ($4.7 billion).
The leader of the United Palmer Party (PUP), Clive Palmer, has not approved the transfer of the government.
A poorly planned mining tax reversal initiative will not pass the Senate without a low-income pension, income support bonus and a bonus for school-age children, he tweeted.
The government needs the support of independent parties like the PUP to ensure that the Labour Party and the Greens do not oppose the initiative in the Senate.
The shadow finance minister, Chris Bowen, accused the government of trying to remove Parliament's power to decide on the mandatory guarantee of pensions by giving the finance minister full decision-making power.
"This is unprecedented", he told reporters in Canberra.
The government could thus delay further increases, which would move the Labour Party's target of 12 per cent of the pension guarantee up to 2034.
It is by no means acceptable and the Labour Party will of course oppose it by all means, says Bowen.
The guarantee is now 9.5%, but the government wants to give the finance minister the power to decide whether to stop the upcoming additions.
A man's body was found on a beach in Brighton.
Sussex police recovered the body of an unidentified man before 2pm, and closed an area near the entrance to the popular tourist attraction, the Volks Electric Railway.
Police and a coroner are working to determine the circumstances under which the body was washed up on the beach.
The man hasn't been identified yet.
Investigators will go through the list of missing persons to determine if the missing persons have any connection to the body.
Police have not yet been able to confirm whether the death occurred under suspicious circumstances.
According to the Mexican police, one death was reported in an accidental explosion at the border.
According to Piedras Negras police, an apparent accidental explosion at a customs building on the Mexican-American border resulted in the death of one woman and the injury of five others.
Alberto Felix Lopez Arenas is the chief of operations for the local police in the Texas border town.
He told the Associated Press news agency that a woman who died in the Sunday blast suffered head injuries and five others suffered burns.
Lopez Arenas said the blast occurred this morning in the customs officers' nightclubs.
The cause of the explosion is currently under investigation, but authorities believe the explosion was caused by a buildup of gas.
The explosion did not affect the border guard.
Three Atlantic City casinos are closing in September.
Three Atlantic City casinos are closing this month.
The customer is playing at the Showboat Casino, which is due to close its doors, Atlantic City, N.J., 29.7.2014
September is a tough month for Atlantic City, with three casinos handing out their last cards.
Three casinos are closing this month in Atlantic City, New Jersey, which means that this neon-light, cash machine-driven metropolis can no longer count on gaming revenues.
More than 5,000 workers are out of work as Showboat and Revel casinos close this weekend, the Associated Press reported.
There's gonna be more unemployed when Trump Plaza turns off its lights.
The closure of three casinos, one of which had only been in operation for two years, is the city's latest disaster after the Atlantic Club Center story ended just eight months earlier.
By the end of September, more than 25 percent of the city's casino workers, 8,000 people, will be unemployed, reports the New York Times.
When gambling was legalized in New Jersey in 1976, casinos were advertised as a safe option for the poorly-funded Atlantic City, reports the AP News Agency.
However, the local gambling industry has gained much more competition as casinos in New York, Delaware, and Pennsylvania are losing much of Atlantic City's once-huge casino offerings.
Even Massachusetts, which has previously opposed gambling, is now keeping its eye on its share of the money by welcoming three casinos into the state.
TVO: Areva's new schedule is difficult to accept
According to the Ministry of Industry (TVO), it is difficult to accept the new assessment of the institutional supplier Areva that the Olkiluodon 3 reactor will not be put into commercial use until 2018.
According to Jouni Silvennoisen, the project manager for the power plant, this is partly due to the fact that the construction work is already largely complete and the number of works in progress is known.
TVO will continue to assess the data received from Areva.
In the communication, Silvennoinen notes that TVO welcomes any initiative to accelerate the project.
Areva today provided TVO with an updated schedule for Olkiluoto 3, according to which construction of the third reactor will be completed in mid-2016 and commercial operations could start in 2018.
According to Areva, the recent delays in the project are mainly due to the approval of the reactor's automation systems, which was obtained in April.
This was preceded by four years of negotiations with TVO.
The first phase of Olkiluot 3 was to be completed in 2009, but the schedule has been postponed time and time again.
TVO and Areva have been arguing for years about who is responsible for the delay.
The dispute is settled in an arbitration in which Areva has sought EUR 2,7 billion in damages from TVO.
TVO, on the other hand, considers Areva's claims to be unfounded and requires the company to pay approximately EUR 1,8 billion.
Cooperation between energy and water operators is needed in the face of global challenges
International leaders met today in Stockholm for the 24th International Water Week, calling on energy and water operators to work together to meet the greatest challenges of our time to ensure adequate water and energy production for a growing population.
The theme for Water Week 2014 is Energy and Water.
Water and energy are very often interdependent.
Energy is needed for pumping, storing, transporting, and purifying water, and water is needed for almost all energy production.
If one of these increases or decreases, it immediately affects the other.
These two resources are also integral to sustainable development and must always be kept in mind when making global decisions.
Torgny Holmgren, Director of the Stockholm International Water Institute, organised the Water Week, said at the opening of the Water Week that the challenges were enormous.
Global water consumption is expected to increase by 55% between 2000 and 2050 and energy consumption is expected to increase by 50% over the next two decades, and therefore closer cooperation between energy and water operators is urgently needed to find solutions that will enable all the world's peoples to thrive.
This year's winner of the Water Week Prize, Professor John Briscoe, described water as the foundation for growth that society as a whole and other sectors need.
They need to mobilize these resources.
Briscoe added that there is no permanent solution to the water crisis anywhere.
Instead, there are challenges and solutions that make up the circle.
During the week, the delegates will discuss the ongoing and upcoming work and cooperation of energy and water operators during more than 100 seminars, workshops and events.
Originally from South Africa, Professor John Briscoe will receive the Stockholm Water Prize from His Majesty King Charles XVI of Sweden at a ceremony at Stockholm City Hall on Thursday 4 September.
The Stockholm International Water Institute (SIWI) is a research centre that produces research data and provides decision-makers with information to make rational decisions on water and sustainable development.
Flying dead foreign bodies home to Miami: Costs of flying bodies
In October 2012, a boat carrying 23 Cuban refugees to Miami collapsed, and 14 people were reported dead.
It's happened to hundreds of people before, and this was probably not the last of its kind.
Each year, more than 1,000 Central American immigrants die trying to cross the U.S. border illegally.
For the sake of the first city, we're ready to die.
Ironically, however, when they arrive in the country's first city, few plan to stay there until their last breath.
For many, this city is a temporary place of residence: either a refuge, a bowl of upward striving, or a place of leisure while waiting for a better opportunity.
Few imagine dying there, and as death approaches, many plan to return home.
The cities that are popular with immigrants are home to a disproportionate number of foreign-born and temporary residents, and death and return are constantly at work.
An estimated 20 percent of the bodies of South Florida's dead are flown elsewhere, more than anywhere else in the United States.
Most human remains (HR, short for "human remains") are flown to their homeland from Miami International Airport.
According to the CEO of Pierson, the largest company in the industry, about 80 percent of this traffic has been overseas since 1964, flying bodies to several destinations in Central and South America and several European countries.
The Commission has also adopted a proposal for a regulation on the protection of the environment.
The more immigrants move to popular cities, the more they die there.
Even after death, returning home has its costs.
Miami is the main airport for American Airlines flights to Latin America, and the figures in the table show the remnants of people returned by the airline to their home country in 2013.
The return of the bodies to their homeland is not cheap. Prices can range from five hundred to thousands of dollars.
Religious, cultural and public health requirements for the transport and transport of human remains also vary.
Immigrant communities in immigrant-favorite cities sometimes organize funeral societies to help with expenses, as the return of bodies is expensive, the government does not help with the process, and the dead are often young people without insurance.
Some credit institutions and unofficial health insurance programs have been created in the past from such societies founded by Italian, Jewish and Greek immigrants in New York City  the first immigrant groups in the United States.
New generations of immigrants from Mexico, China, the Philippines, and Bangladesh now work in many of their favorite cities.
The airline is a subsidiary of American Airlines.
Death abroad always brings difficulties, for few who have moved abroad plan to make the migrant town their last resting place.
For example, in Dubai, foreigners who die without a will are subject to Sharia law, even though the laws on inheritance in the deceased's home country differ.
All the assets of the deceased are frozen and then distributed in accordance with the Sharia Court decision.
The network for the transport of human remains of Aer Lingus, headquartered in Dublin (
The size of the city and the multicultural population of the Irish people reflects the size of the city.
The airline suspended the service but restarted it in 2004 after receiving negative feedback from migrants.
The thought of death is rarely present when a person walks forward through or resides in a city that is a favorite destination for immigrants.
On the contrary, a temporary or permanent move to a migrant city is an open declaration of the immigrant's view of life, not death.
However, dying in a migrant town abroad means making the most powerful and irrevocable decisions for the migrant  whether he wants to be part of a local or global community, universe or country, short-term or permanent.
The Centre and the Left Alliance are mediating on inequality
The opposition parties of the centre and the left coalition intend to bring the government to the table with the question of the livelihoods of low-income people and the rise of inequality.
The parties want to raise the debate on the problems of livelihoods of people, which are exacerbated by poor economic development and worsening unemployment.
The increasing inequality is also evident between different parts of the country and within the major cities, the parties note in their communication.
The government's next year's budget will target cutbacks and tax increases on low-income people such as students, unemployed and pensioners, family and regular workers, while food, medicine and housing, among others, continue to rise.
The parties said in their press release that almost half a million people are already unemployed.
The problems of the working class have also worsened.
The Centre and the Left Alliance parliamentary groups will discuss the matter on Thursday.
The third opposition party, the fundamentalists, has already announced that it will leave the police and internal security resources to the media.
The parliamentary session begins tomorrow, Tuesday.
The New York City West Indian Day parade is about to begin.
Caribbean culture is once again on the horizon in New York City, where the West Indian Day parade is one of the biggest outdoor events of the year, and where politicians also see each other and get to see each other.
The annual parade is held Monday in Brooklyn.
It is a celebration of traditional carnivals leading up to the fasting season, and it includes dancers who wear elaborate, often silk-made costumes.
Brooklyn County President Eric Adams is the festival's host this year, but there are many other political figures to look forward to.
The parade is a great opportunity for current and up-and-coming politicians to greet the public a week before the primary.
Despite the festivities, violence has been part of the end of the parade in previous years.
Police have said they will try to keep the incident safe by taking extra measures, including monitoring the activities of gangs operating nearby.
Is it worth asking any rhetorical questions?
Everybody knows rhetorical questions, right?
That's not a question to answer.
This grammatical figure, a question that is not expected to be answered but that suggests a certain direction of answer, is a mixture of high-pitched speech and more everyday word-for-word.
The opening words of Cicero's famous accusation of Catilina are a chain of rhetorical questions, the first of which is "How long, O Catilina, will you use our patience?"
My wife also has questions about why I should not warm up a five-day-old chicken for the children.
Why are you so nervous?
Erotea is a better word for a rhetorical question.
The power of rhetorical question lies in the fact that it is open and the audience is inclined to accept it.
A mysterious rhetorical question suggests that no reasonable person could agree.
In a 19th-century literary guide, David Williams described rhetorical questions as words that are admirably designed to convey a strong sense of truth about a subject, while challenging the impossibility of disagreement.
The Art of Bending
Rhetorical questions can be raised backwards if you want to achieve more ambitious goals.
A series of rhetorical questions that are designed to express grief or anger are called epilepsy.
For example, Job uses them to appeal to the Almighty: "What profit do you get from oppressing me --?
Do you have the same eyes as us?
Do you see the way a human sees?
The chain of rhetorical questions is also found in my wife's comments: Why did you inflict food poisoning on the children?
Are you out of your mind?
Can't you do anything right?
There is also the so-called hypofora, which is when you ask a question and you answer it immediately.
Isaac Hayes provides a perfect example of this: Who is that black private egg that is a sex scare to all women?
- The beard!
What a moss!
Who would sacrifice their life for their brother?
More examples from my wife: What is the only food the children have eaten and what could have made them sick?
This chicken.
Who the fuck fed them that?
You, you.
Strangely, rhetorical questions do not usually seek to bend, although rhetoric refers to the art of bending.
If you are trying to talk to someone instead of trying to preach to the already converted or to be disgusted by someone's stubbornness, you should use rhetorical questions sparingly.
They are more useful when trying to reconcile opinions than when trying to get another person to accept their own.
If the audience agrees with the statement And isn't it nice when it's so sunny outside?, the rhetorical question is that the speaker is confident about what he's saying, which ties the speaker and the audience together better.
However, this will only happen if the speaker is sure that there are no differences of opinion.
Assuming that consensus has been reached rather than a consensus effort, the speaker may appear, well, self-conscious.
In other situations, a rhetorical question points to a weakness of the argument.
In newspaper headlines, the rhetorical question is all too often the strongest argument possible in a very weak case: Did the astronauts build pyramids?
In both cases, the danger is that the question may lead to an answer that differs from the implied answer.
Do you feel the same way as we do? was a risky campaign slogan for the Conservative Party in the UK in the 2005 general election.
The party lost.
Some have become enthusiastic about finding such cases, and the so-called QTWAIN questions (a term popularized by British journalist John Rentoul as Questions To Which Answer Is No, questions whose answer is no) are popular.
A few years ago, a friend of mine organized a competition to find the best examples.
The contest was clearly won by the song "Do You Wanna Be In My Gang?" sung by pop star Gary Glitter before he was exposed as a child sexual abuser.
The author has also written the book You Talkin to Me?
The time for a federal compromise may be over .
At the beginning of the conflict, many countries still thought that the federal government could be some kind of compromise to the conflict, Saari says.
Russian President Vladimir Putin said earlier in an interview with the Russian Channel that peace in eastern Ukraine requires discussions on the statehood of the region.
In practice, this would mean some form of self-government in eastern Ukraine.
Putin said it would protect the legal rights of people living in the East.
The conversion of Ukraine into a federal state is, according to Saara, in some ways a priority for Russia's objectives.
Ukraine certainly has reason to doubt that Russia would seek to influence Ukraine's internal politics, he says.
If a federal solution is not reached, another option from Russia's perspective could be some kind of frozen conflict, where Russia would effectively control Luhansk and Donetsk, Saari said.
The West and Ukraine have accused Russia of sending weapons and troops to the east.
Russia has denied the claims, although, for example, pro-Russian rebels have themselves reported that their troops have fought "resting, volunteer Russian soldiers".
Upin Director: A powerful task for Kate
The brick reminds us that the operation is new and still unfolding.
He said that the idea was that Katainen would somehow coordinate or even lead the Commission's work on competitiveness and employment.
The Commission's new programme for the new period will, of course, focus on the competitiveness and employment of the Union.
That way we are at the heart of the Commission's power, says Tiilikainen.
Mr Tiilikainen believes that Mr Katai's background, his economic knowledge and his role during the economic crisis will enable him to take a good position within the Commission.
The plans say the mission would be unpacked, meaning Kata would have no headquarters of his own.
Instead, Katais would become a team leader in the EU's competitiveness and employment field, where he could coordinate the bags of the Economic Commissioner and other sectors.
In practice, managing a team could mean planning and steering, for example.
Mothers of soldiers: Up to 15,000 Russian soldiers in Ukraine
According to the Russian Military Mothers' Organization, as many as 15,000 Russian soldiers have been deployed to Ukraine in the past two months, and there are now more than 7,000 Russian soldiers in the country.
Human rights groups say at least 200 Russian soldiers have died.
According to the organization, the hospital in Rostov, near the Ukrainian border, is full of wounded in the Ukrainian war.
The mothers of soldiers collect information from their families.
The NATO military alliance estimates that there are over a thousand Russian troops in Ukraine.
BB-Andte on his drinking: "After a little drinking, there's a case"
Big brother Jussi and Andte went out on a Monday night to reflect on the life of the BB house.
Jussi, who was in the basement, was walking on a gym on Monday night, chatting with Andé, a resident of the courtyard.
The two were wondering what their actions would make the viewers of the program think.
Andte said you don't know until you see it.
You know, Jussin thinks most of the time at BB House is waiting and wasting time.
Any celebrations or missions are just a fraction of the life of the BB house.
More than that, we wait and wonder and talk and live.
Andte, Anne and Jussi.
The people at the mansion spent Wednesday nights in wet places and alcohol was especially on the Andes' phone.
And I asked him if the parties had made his life in the house more meaningful now that he had been able to share them with these other residents in a small village.
Andte admitted, "I'll have a little drink and then we'll have a little business".

Corporate profits are pleasing to shareholders but not increasing growth
Do the directors of Australian publicly traded companies today only try to please the masses by granting the shareholders' wishes for greater profit and by buying back their shares?
Is the decision-making power shifting from corporate governments to the shareholders that the board serves?
The profit margin is the most important, as was shown last week at the end of the 2014 reporting period.
The prices of the shares of companies that have rewarded investors through buy-back schemes and increased profit sharing have risen sharply.
And there's nothing wrong with that.
The downside to this is that capital spending is falling faster than analysts predicted, and this has led many to question whether we are overemphasizing short-term popularity and focusing enough on near-term and long-term growth.
Of course, some companies return money to shareholders and finance their business in other ways.
More funding is obtained, for example, from the cheap stock markets.
From the company's point of view, this makes sense, since the loan is currently cheap, while the capital is not.
Even if the funds obtained from the credit market were not taken into account, it is clear that the main reason for the opening-up of the company to shareholders is that it uses less money to invest.
The net result of this wave of purchase programmes (and the cancellation of profit plans) is a decrease in capital on the Australian market.
Credit Suisse calls this reporting period a period of capital decline during which companies have made every effort to keep the number of shares low.
As part of the same plan, companies are becoming less and less capitalist.
At the end of the reporting period, the value of the repurchase programmes was $3.7 billion and the value of the expected, unrealised capital acquisition programmes was $1.5 billion.
Credit Suisse has gone so far as to call capital expenditure a curse in one of its headlines.
Although we now have figures that confirm that this trend exists, unofficial evidence has been around for months.
The Governor of the Australian Central Bank, Glenn Stevens, was sufficiently aware a few weeks ago that firms need a little more 'fighting spirit' to increase investment.
Stevens is concerned not with the prospects of individual companies but with the overall impact on the economy, as slow capital expenditure usually leads to negative consequences for economic growth and employment.
Credit Suisse claims that the own estimates of the companies reporting their capital expenditure have decreased by an average of 4% over the previous two years.
Estimates of free cash flow have increased by an average of 2%.
Improving cash flow is likely to increase capital expenditure.
This quick look looks good from the standpoint of current shareholders and the stock market, but it is also somehow proof of the companies' compliance.
If I had a coin every time the CEO said the short-term price of a stock was not important, I would be... well, the end of the sentence is easy to guess.
This claim is, of course, not true.
The CEOs monitor the prices of shares very closely and are very concerned about price fluctuations.
The short-term and long-term bonus packages of CEOs are determined by the value of the shares and the position of the CEOs depends on this.
The CEOs want to say that some decisions (whether they are business acquisitions, increased investment in an organisation or profit sharing) may not always be immediately favourable, but they are useful for medium-term strategy.
In fact, executives often complain that the investment market is very shortsighted.
The current conservatism therefore seems to be a compromise on short-term goals.
However, it was all too clear that the focus was on reducing future capital consumption and that more conservative companies were encouraged.
Large mining companies such as BHP and Rio Tinto were the leaders in reducing capital expenditure, but many other companies were also acting in the same way  partly because of the constraints and partly because they feared shareholder reactions.
So why do investors pressure companies to share profits?
According to Hasan Tevfik, a strategist at Credit Suisse, it is clear that shareholders want more income, as the profits of other, more traditional fixed-income investment products have decreased when, suddenly, central banks have cut interest rates worldwide to bring more money to the market.
In this way, investors are forced to seek profit on the capital market and they in turn pressure companies to share more profits.
The shareholders have also made it quite clear to the companies that they are not willing to invest in high-risk companies with uncertain dividends.
Investors would prefer to have money at once as more and more investors approach retirement age.
The statistics for the previous reporting period clearly show that the profit margin was heavily influenced by the company's cost cuts and not by the increase in turnover.
The leakage of public nudity appears to be a data breach or an email account breach.
According to some sources, the unknown hacker who leaked photos of Jennifer Lawrence and videos to the Internet is puzzling security experts and Apple.
While the hacker has posted lists of female public figures in a chat room and said he has more pictures of women, some of those photographed have reported that their images are fake while others have said they were long ago removed.
There are many photographs, and some of them are said to include Jennifer Lawrence, Jenny McCarthy, Rihanna, Kate Upton and American actress Mary E Winstead.
After the hacking, the biggest question is how the attack was carried out.
And were the photos and videos real and where were they uploaded?
The most recent source of images  A shameless and thorough attack on Apple's iCloud service  is the most unlikely option.
Big companies like Apple have invested in in-house security teams that are constantly trying to hack into their own systems.
It is unlikely that there will be a large-scale hack into Apple's iCloud service.
The original publisher also does not claim that the claim is true, notes Rik Ferguson, Vice President of the Information Security Research Unit at Trend Micro.
The simplest and most likely explanation for these hacks involving public figures (and the less well-known hacks that occur every day) is to leak an email address and password, either by speculating or by hacking data, or by tricking a person into logging in with their information to a genuine-looking website, and then using that information against them.
Apple is still investigating the alleged attack on its iCloud service, which is used on iPhone phones to store settings and, above all, to back up images when they are transferred to a cloud server.
The user's account can be logged in to iCloud by providing this email address and password, after which their picture and other information can be downloaded from the account.
This can only be prevented if the account holder has implemented two-factor authentication (two factor authentication, 2FA), which is additional protection against account intrusion, by sending a code to the account holder's mobile phone before the account can be logged in.
However, relatively few people use the 2FA feature, either because it's not known or because it's considered inconvenient.
Apple is still investigating whether all data comes from its iCloud service and, if so, how extensively users' accounts were hacked.
The company has not commented on this at the time of publication of the original version of this text.
Ferguson believes that the hacker may have used the Uned password link on Apple's iCloud service by first collecting email addresses from public figures, for example from the address book of another hacked device.
It's also possible that celebrities used the same password on multiple services, which led to the hijacking of passwords.
Lawrence's publisher claims the photos are authentic, but doesn't say when they were taken.
Winstead said on his Twitter account that this could be a long-term hacking operation.
These pictures were taken a long time ago, so I can only imagine how much time this took to look at it.
I feel sorry for everyone else who has been hacked, he tweeted.
However, independent security expert Graham Cluley notes that Winstead may have thought he had removed the images from his mobile phone, but removing the image from a modern smartphone does not always mean that the image is not copied.
Modern smartphones regularly store images in the cloud because they often do not have room for large numbers of user-made images.
The default setting for Apple's iPhone is to store images in the iCloud; Google Android uses Google+ and Microsoft Windows phones store images in OneDrive.
Independent service providers such as Dropbox offer an automatic image and data storage service.
"People take and delete pictures, but they don't realize that they're being uploaded to their account", Cluley told The Guardian.
Ferguson agrees that "removal does not always mean removal", he says.
You can keep photos and videos for years.
If someone accesses the user's email address and password, they can re-download all the images and videos sent by email.
The images from Apple's service can be downloaded to a Mac, Windows PC or any Apple device.
The hacker released a screenshot that allegedly featured unreleased videos and images taken from a Windows PC.
Two-stage identification protects against this type of hacking because it requires anyone trying to copy an existing account to another device to provide the original user's device, usually a mobile phone, with the code.
Without the code, access to the account is blocked.
Both Apple, Google, Microsoft and Yahoo offer two-stage account identification, but it is not yet known whether those public figures used the service or how many of them used it.
Some have said that the pictures they are alleged to have are not authentic.
A spokeswoman for Ariana Grande has said that the images that she claims to have are "completely forged".
Victoria Justice tweeted: "I think the nude photos taken are HATED, don't you understand.
Let me cut off the rumors from the roots right away.
Cluley's bringing up another option.
Because the hackers were public figures, their accounts could have been hacked by someone who ran their social media accounts or regularly ran their email.
"I'd like to know if the actors' agencies or any representatives know about it", he wonders.
However, those public figures do not use a single publisher or agency.
The second option is that someone who installed one or more of the security attack victims or helped configure them and changed the system secretly so that all the data could be restored.
This was the case of Christopher Chaney, a Florida-based hacker nicknamed "Hollywood hacker", who posted photos from Scarlett Johansson and Mila Kunis' email accounts in 2011, and was sentenced to 10 years in prison in December 2012. He was also ordered to pay more than $66,000 in damages.
Chaney was accused of secretly hacking into the email accounts of over 50 entertainment industry figures between November 2010 and October 2011. In one case, he asked Aguilera for pictures of the star in the name of the stylist in a low-cost dress, and then posted the photos online.
Chaney later apologized, saying that his actions were certainly one of the worst violations of privacy imaginable.
Chaney was also accused of spying on two people online for more than a decade.
According to Clue, in the case of Chaney, the stars' email accounts were hacked and changed so that someone forwarded their information even after changing their password.
Cluley says the obsession of hackers breaking into these accounts reminds me of a butterfly collection.
They just want to collect this kind of information.
It is possible that in this case someone had stumbled upon a list containing the information on these accounts and the log-in information on services such as Dropbox.
The hackers may have been trying to hack into the system for a long time.
Or they could access the information on someone's email account, like an address book, and then they could fish the information of other people.
I don't think it's a simple security gateway to the iCloud.
Australia has offered its intelligence services to help the UN track down 44 peacekeepers kidnapped in Syria by al-Qaeda-linked terrorists.
The terrorist group Jabhat al-Nusra is believed to be holding 44 Fijian peacekeepers, who captured a crossing point in the Golan Heights last week and forced UN troops to surrender.
The peacekeepers have been missing since Wednesday and their whereabouts are unknown.
At the same time, ministers attending the UN Conference of Small Island Developing States, including Australian Foreign Minister Julie Bishop, are deeply concerned about what has happened.
Bishop discussed the situation with UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon at the summit, and he has offered Australian assistance to rescue the missing peacekeepers.
"I have assured you that Australia will help the UN wherever it can, including through intelligence services", he told the AAP news service from Samoa on Monday.
We're in very close contact with all the intelligence community and friends -- to make sure we can locate them and that they're safe.
Bishop has already assured Fiji's Prime Minister Frank Bainimarama and Foreign Minister Ratu Inoke Kubuabo that Australia will use its position on the UN Security Council to monitor the situation.
Meanwhile, a Philippine peacekeeping force held prisoner by the military was reported to have fled the same disputed area in different parts of the country.
The UN has been monitoring the Golan Heights since the 1974 Syrian-Israeli ceasefire.
Fraudsters are trying to steal your money by using a carbon tax reverse initiative, warns the Australian Competition Commission ACCC
The scammers are using the carbon tax reversal tool to steal money, the ACCC warns.
The Competition Authority's SCAMwatch unit has warned consumers and businesses against trusting the overly good-sounding offers of government agencies offering thousands of dollars in compensation.
Fraudsters may use the figures seen in the media to prove to consumers how much they can save on purchases of goods after the carbon tax is repealed and offer them up to $7,000, the warning says.
Fraudsters may sound very persuasive because they have uncovered the victim's personal information, which they use to try to get their bank details or to get the victim to pay a reward.
They discuss topical topics to trick the victim.
Fraudsters use other than carbon tax scams to get their hands on money, their stories are more advanced, and they use current events to build a scam around them.
The disappearance of Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 and the death of Robin Williams have also inspired scammers.
The ACCC instructs to contact the company using the contact information itself rather than the contact information provided by the caller if there is any doubt as to the identity of the caller representing the company.
If you receive an unexpected call or email from someone claiming to represent a government agency or a company, such as an energy company, claiming that you are entitled to compensation for the carbon tax withdrawal, beware.
If you believe that you have been cheated and have provided personal information or transferred money to the account of the fraudster, contact your bank immediately.
If the offer sounds too good to be true  for example, government-sponsored free money  it's probably true.
Economic statement: Flipponen condemned EU sanctions against Russia
Former Prime Minister Paavo Lipponen has criticized the EU's sanctions on Russia in an interview with the Economic Press.
Russia's policy is to pursue its own interests.
This does not necessarily impose a power barrier", Lipponen says in an interview.
Lipponen has started working as an auditor for the Arctic business of the European Union's Central Association of Life Sciences.
He is concerned that the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) and the European Investment Bank (EIB) have suspended Russian funding for projects as part of EU economic sanctions.
"It means, for example, that environmental projects in the northern dimension with clear views are going to freeze", Lipponen says in an interview.
The freezing of funding is now hampering cooperation, which Lippos says can be difficult to rebuild if there is no trust.
However, he believes that Finnish companies' interest in cooperation projects in the Ice Sea region will continue to be as strong as ever.
He is currently working for the EC on Finland's Arctic policy and business opportunities in the North.
It is not affected by the acute situation in Ukraine or the situation in Russia.
The study looks far ahead, it talks about ten years", he says.
It is rare for a norp to come to shallow water or near a settlement, says nature educator Vesa Heinonen of the North Country Museum's lecture center.
A bald eagle was spotted swimming near the beach in the Bay of Suvi today.
Heinos said the orphan probably came after the food in the Gulf of Suez.
It's not a mess.
That means there's fish in the area, Heinonen's tip.
For example, he says that the Sundom Bridge is particularly popular in spring and autumn for the nerds who come to the area specifically after fish.
However, the norp is not a common species in the marine area of Vaasa.
"On the land of the living, you'll see a norp in the halls of the pleasure houses", he continues.
Norppia lives in the Mediterranean Sea and the Insular Sea.
A South Australian court has ruled that the murdered pizza owner Robert Vallelonga acted aggressively and violently outside the nightclub.
The murder of Robert Vallelong, a South Australian pizza owner.
The court's investigation revealed that pizza owner Robert Vallelonga was aggressive towards both his partner and security guard just minutes before he was killed outside the nightclub.
The lawyers of the defendant in Vallelonga's murder asked the lower court in Adelaide to release their client on bail, as it was clearly self-defense.
Marie Shaw, QC, said the case is not serious enough to hold her client, whose identity has not been released, behind bars until trial.
"The evidence shows that the deceased was so aggressive that he had to be removed from the nightclub", she said.
Then a fight broke out, and the 40-year-old drunk man tore the security guard's shirt.
It's important to note that the prosecutor said the death was caused by one blow, which clearly indicates self-defense or defense of another.
A 25-year-old man has been charged with murder so far.
Vallelonga, 44, was found unconscious near the intersection of Rundle St. and Synagogue Square at approximately 2:25 a.m. on May 4th, with severe head injuries.
He died of his injuries at Adelaide's Royal Hospital early the next day, leaving friends and pizza shop guests mourning the local legend of One Tree Hill.
Prosecutors said the defendant's murder was not a crime and that after the incident, he told the taxi driver that he had asked someone to sleep for a few days.
But the security camera video now proves something else, Shaw says.
 It confirms that the deceased was acting aggressively -- his partner tried to calm him down and he himself suffered a violent and violent behavior, he says.
Our client has both the presumption of innocence and the evidence that he defended himself, which will be mentioned in court.
Prosecutors opposed the man's release because only one of the three security guards on the scene on the night of the crash had been involved in the Vallelonga act.
They said that other security guards did not consider him a threat because he was short, and that he used the word store of a big man to avoid physical confrontation.
They said that even the taxi driver who clearly saw the incident would testify that Vallelonga was hit hard and had no chance to defend himself.
Judge Elizabeth Sheppard ordered the man to be detained until the following week, when he will announce his decision.
The contested dolphin hunt began in Japan ... justified as a tradition ...
Bad weather was expected to postpone the start of a world-wide, outrageous hunt.
In the Japanese city of Taijin, the annual dolphin hunting season resumed on Monday.
It's expected to last until the end of February.
The British newspaper Guardian reports that the hunt has been met with fierce opposition around the world.
In the hunt, hunters chase hundreds of dolphins to a remote bay where mammals are slaughtered after selecting the most suitable individuals for transportation to dolphin parks and theme parks around the world.
The dolphin's flesh also ends up being food.
However, according to local authorities, the start of the hunt was expected to be delayed due to bad weather.
This practice was made known to the world in 2009 with the documentary The Cove.
During previous hunting seasons, hunters have been criticized not only by animal rights groups but also by diplomats.
However, the opponents say that dolphin meat has a limited market because of its high mercury content.
According to the pro-hunting groups, including the Japanese government, this is a tradition.
Defenders have also reminded us that dolphins are not endangered.
The dolphin hunts were already opposed by protests over the weekend in several countries.
Protesters in Tokyo say the hunt is damaging Japan's reputation in the world.
A demonstration was also held in Helsinki on Monday in front of the Japanese Embassy.
Part of the uncertainties of NATO member states in deploying new troops to Eastern Europe
Within NATO, there is a split opinion on whether NATO bases should be established in Eastern Europe and the Baltics in response to the Ukraine crisis, reports the Financial Times.
Poland and Viro have asked for a military alliance to bring in permanent troops, but German Chancellor Angela Merkel has opposed the plan.
"Ukraine has given a new perspective to Russian politics and threatens to undermine European security", Michael Clarke, director of the Royal United Services Institute in London, told the Financial Times.
NATO member states are in the next week, and the military alliance is due to announce its new preparedness plan.
The key question of the plan is whether NATO can violate the 1990 TAE Convention on Conventional Weapons.
It is the agreement between NATO and the Warsaw Pact on the deployment of armed forces in the region between the Atlantic and the Urals.
In practice, the agreement prevents new military bases in Eastern Europe and the Baltic states, according to the Financial Times.
Russia itself froze its participation in the agreement in 2007, but it did not actually withdraw from it.
In view of the deteriorating situation in Ukraine, NATO is considering whether the terms of the agreement should still be complied with.
"Natural resources must be in all NATO countries that need them", said Sir Malcolm Rifkind, chairman of the UK Parliament's Security Committee, to the Financial Times.
Matt Guthmiller , youngest person to fly around the world
While the other teenagers were learning to drive, Matt Guthmiller learned to fly.
Guthmiller, 19, just became the youngest person to fly around the world alone, reports CBS News correspondent Carter Evans.
A young man from South Dakota flew 30,000 miles, making 23 stops in 15 different countries on five continents.
On the way, Guthmiller was treated like a rock star because of his record-breaking flying performance.
Guthmiller also heard critical comments:
Too risky and a spoiled, rich little kid just wants to see a little bit of the world and have fun.
Guthmiller had little to say to those who made such comments.
I enjoyed a lot of it, of course, but it also involved a lot of hard work, and I hope that with my record, I can inspire other people to go out into the world and do great things.
Guthmiller's interest in flying began when he was young, and he first asked his parents to let him eat at the airport cafes.
Later, he demanded to be in flight lessons.
My parents let me on a short, $20 flight, a 20-minute flight, but I think they thought at the time that my enthusiasm for it would stop.
It didn't stop.
Soon afterward, Guthmiller made a deal with his parents that would allow him more time in the cockpit.
I agreed to share a car with my dad all high school instead of having my own car.
I could fly planes in a bargain.
By the age of 17, Guthmiller had earned his pilot's license, and two years later he was leasing a single-engine Beechcraft aircraft for his solo flight around the world.
A young man at MIT was the one who handled the plane and made the fuel calculations.
Several hours in the upper world also meant that he himself needed extra help.
I'm pretty much on caffeine and Oreos.
Guthmiller says he ate a few cookies all over the place on a long flight.
Flying in the clouds was both amazing and scary.
In other lands, air traffic controllers had no means of regulating the weather to help him navigate the storms.
I had no idea which clouds rose just slightly above the plane and which climbed to an altitude of 45,000 feet and shattered the plane.
Guthmiller's plane was not pressurized and had no oxygen supply, so he could not fly above the clouds.
The fuel capacity of the engine couldn't have been higher.
The day after the interview, another young pilot, 17-year-old Haris Suleman, died after his plane crashed on a flight between American Samoa and Hawaii, which Guthmiller calls the most difficult part of his journey.
Guthmiller flew from the same airport as Suleman, and he believes the ascent phase is technically challenging because of the high fuel required for a 16-hour flight.
Despite the risks and even the fear of high places, Guthmiller managed to break the record and raise money for ATK training through the Code.org website.
He's a coder himself, and he started his own company at the age of 12.
Guthmiller's goals are in the sky.
I mean, it would be great to start the next Apple, but let's see how it goes.
Guthmiller's going to be shooting high anyway.
Go to heaven and you can achieve something great.
Finding the right franchisor is harder than you think.
Lori Joyce was thrilled to have fans queue her Cupcakes by Heather and Lori at her stores across Canada after the Canadian W TV channel began airing The Cupcake Girls reality TV show in 2009.
The excitement continued until it became clear that one franchisor was not fit for the job.
"My franchisor sat in his car and called me and told me that 100 potential customers were lined up outside the store ready to buy cupcakes and he couldn't stand it", Joyce says.
This event opened my eyes, because it was a huge lost opportunity for us.
After that, Joyce decided to change the process of selecting franchise partners, starting with emphasizing corporate culture rather than bread-making skills.
"Anyone can shine in an interview -- they know what I want to hear", he says, adding that he's conducted about 100 interviews for each of the 11 franchises.
We start with six weeks of continuing training, but the way employees work is completely different in the workplace itself, so the whole process is quite difficult.
Finding the right franchisor is vital to the growth of any small business.
A strong and honest leader can shape and grow an organization, whereas a leader who is not well suited to the task can cause costly damage to the company.
"I used to think that looking for a franchise is like going on a date, but that's not true at all, because during a date, you can do a lot to get to know someone before you get married", Joyce says.
Instead, in the case of the franchisor partner, a contract is signed, a guarantee is obtained and a new store is built.
Making a partnership with someone before you see how they're doing is a huge step and a significant test of trust.
The symbiotic relationship between the franchisee partners is like a strong marriage, because they share common goals", explains Lorraine McLachlan, president and CEO of the Canadian Franchise Association (CFA).
Therefore, McLachlan considers that a franchisor should also be careful in choosing a future franchisor before entering into such a long-term partnership.
"The same idea goes for your relationships: If your date is already rude on a date, imagine what he's like in marriage", she says.
It is equally important for both parties to choose and evaluate a future contractual partner carefully and to pay attention to the smallest warning signs on either side.
McLachlan adds that franchises like Joyce can learn from past successes and mistakes, but first-time franchises need to be more careful when choosing their first, most important partners.
In contrast, new franchisees must decide on the basis of the supposedly successful parent company what challenges they have faced and what skills the new franchisees need to face similar difficulties.
First time franchisees can also ask for the help of a franchise advisor to create a profile based on industry practices.
McLachlan also recalls that for first time franchisee and entrepreneur, there is a lot of help available on the CFA website at lookforafranchise.ca.
However, the process will be easier later on, as franchisees learn to assess potential entrepreneurs better, but also because the first franchisees can provide advice and help with the assessment.
The work of the first franchise partner helped Brian (founder and CEO of Scudamore, 1-800-GOT-JUNK?) to create the company and franchise system significantly, says Erik Church, Operational Director of O2E Brands, which includes companies such as 1-800-GOT-JUNK?, You Move Me and Wow 1 Day Painting.
Franchise entrepreneurs helped Brian create something he couldn't have created on his own, so the first franchisee has to choose this idea with his mind on it.
Church has 216 franchisees representing all three O2E brands, and is also a Toronto franchise partner of You Move Me.
Chruch's method of finding the right franchise partner is simple.
The confidence test we need to use is asking ourselves Will I invite this person to my barbecue party this weekend?, he says.
If the answer to this question is en, you probably don't want to spend much of your working day looking for solutions with them to major business challenges.
Church also points out that O2E Brands is largely due to its success in franchising.
In a business organisation, managers often see their position as short-term and highly formal to the lower management, while franchisees enter into partnerships with long-term goals and are thus more committed to the success of the business.
Franchise partnerships have far more advantages than traditional business structures, but they are also much more intensive, he says.
It's a partnership, not a relationship between the vice president and the local operations manager.
This kind of partnership is more difficult, but when well managed, it produces better results.
Railroad stations lower grain prices in the northern United States
Delayed rail transportation has led to a significant drop in grain prices in the north-central United States, weeks before the massive harvest is expected to come under new pressure from the transportation network.
Commercial grain farms in North Dakota only provide $2.7 per bushel to farmers - about a dollar less than the guide prices - primarily because of the cost of securing the capacity of the railroad tracks, traders and farmers' organizations say.
IN raw materials
The most acute problems are with the BNSF railway, a subsidiary of Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway, and the Canadian Pacific Railway.
The Federal Railroad Commission is holding a consultation on service issues on Thursday.
In the northern plains, rail transportation of agricultural products is required because of their distance from river networks.
The delay in rail transport increased as the heavy rains of 2013 followed a very cold winter which caused the slowdown and shortening of trains.
Some farmers believe that increased crude oil transportation from the Bakken oil pipeline in North Dakota has displaced grain transportation, which is not true according to railroad companies.
According to the head of an international grain trading company, the cost of grain storage and transportation by train operators has risen from zero to $2,000 to $3,000 per wagon per year.
Someone has to pay the expenses.
These costs are either payable to the farmer or to the customer, says the head of the cereal business.
The U.S. Agricultural Bureau estimates that North Dakota's soybean yield will grow by more than a third and spring yields by 16 percent.
Randy Gordon, president of the National Grain and Feed Association, says that "normally we try to start a new harvest from the clean slate, which means that enough storage space has been emptied for the crop and the grain has been sold and moved.
But now we're starting late because of last year's train service problems.
The railway company BNSF has assured its customers and supervisors that it will handle the transport of this year's harvest smoothly.
John Miller, Vice-President for Agricultural Transport at BNSF, said that the company had reduced the amount of long haul (train wagons ordered by customers after more than four days of delivery) from its peak at the beginning of April, at 16,500, to about two thousand.
"We have moved almost all the old rain we were going to move", Miller says, referring to the surplus grain from the previous rain.
However, the latest reported speeds of BNSF grain trains were 9% lower than in the second quarter of last year, which is a sign of congestion.
Miller acknowledges that the development is uneven, but noted that the company is currently investing $5 billion of capital this year to improve the handling capacity of all types of transported goods such as grain-crowd mills.
The second wave of problems caused by the Canadian Pacific Railway has been 11 per cent slower than at the same time last year, but clearly higher than the much lower speeds of the beginning of the year.
The Canadian Pacific Railway Company has told the Surface Transportation Board that changes to its wagon booking system should improve its ability to handle traffic by 1520 per cent over the coming period.
The Canadian Pacific's fall action plan focuses on continuously improving train speeds and making efficient use of them so that we can deliver more and more train wagons each week, said a representative of the railway company.
The crisis in Ukraine may solve NATO's identity crisis
The leaders, diplomats and experts of the great powers have often been concerned about the future of NATO and whether the end of NATO's Afghanistan mission would mean the end of NATO's own significance.
However, this concern is very premature, as demonstrated at the NATO Summit in Cardiff, Wales, this week, attended by 60 leaders, including US President Barack Obama.
The political and diplomatic agenda is not short of world crises, even to the point that the withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan, once a priority, is no longer the most important issue.
The European Union is a very important part of the European Union, and it is a very important part of the European Union.
World leaders are looking for new ways to punish Russia, but they will also move troops, promise more money for defense spending and re-engage in defense cooperation.
In a way, NATO is a thank you to Vladimir Putin.
It (NATO) was looking for some way to achieve its purpose -- and it was experiencing a pretty significant identity crisis, says Heather Conley, director of the Europe Program at the Washington-based think tank Center for Strategic and International Studies.
NATO has not only found new purpose, but it has also strengthened it.
Obama has also added a new mission to the agenda.
The US president has promised to try to get world leaders to create a common strategy to quickly defeat the militants of the Islamic State, which is gaining popularity in Iraq and Syria.
Officials say the president will face significant challenges in trying to inspire his war-weary partners to respond militarily, particularly to a transnational response from Iraq to Syria.
President Obama, however, is under pressure to show that he is leading the world in finding a strategy to defeat the extremists by first stating directly that we have no strategy.
Western experts have set cautious expectations for the summit as to whether breakthroughs will be achieved in the context of the talks between Ukraine and the Islamic State.
The additional economic sanctions are being planned as a pretext for the event that Russia calls the Ukrainian invasion.
EU officials discussed the matter over the weekend but postponed the decision on new sanctions.
US officials noted that the countries Obama wants to be key partners in the Islamic crisis may not be NATO members.
The accumulation of problems could not have been anticipated two years ago, when the previous NATO summit was held in Chicago, when the debate was dominated by the withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan.
A year earlier, then-President Robert M. Gates made his last speech in office to say that the organisation had almost reached the point of total military insignificance.
U.S. officials complained constantly that other countries were not meeting their financial targets.
NATO members pledge to spend 2% of their GDP on defence, but only four Member States - the UK, Greece, the UK and the US - achieved this target last year.
But now the White House officials say they've noticed a change.
NATO members are expected to sign an agreement in Cardiff to increase their funding for defence cooperation.
The details were discussed late last week, but the White House found that the company was genuinely willing this time to see the potential threats posed by the Member States in their real size.
The defense commitments made by Russia to Ukraine's invasion are more significant and important than ever since the end of the Cold War", says Charles Kupcha, the head of the National Security Council.
We are quite hopeful that we will reach agreement between the 28 Member States.
Obama will spend much of his trip reinforcing his commitment to defense cooperation for Russia's concerned neighbors.
The President will begin his three-day trip with a daylong visit to Tallinn, Viro, where he will meet with the leaders of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania.
NATO has been re-locating its forces in Estonia since Russia annexed Crimea this year and NATO will be re-locating regularly in Estonia as the new preparedness plan, which will be published this week, is put into place.
The plan aims to shorten the time needed by NATO to respond to attacks in border areas, officials say.
The plan includes the addition of air surveillance and other visible signs of defence cooperation.
The amendments present a small risk to NATO, which refrained from establishing permanent bases in Eastern and Central Europe as a sign of its friendliness towards Russia.
Officials said the new plan was not a breach of the agreement, but could also be a mere semantic difference, said a Western diplomat who refused to make a name for himself in the talks before being officially informed.
The NATO presence will likely be described as long-term, not permanent, the diplomat said.
Putin has an effective "winter weapon" - will he use it in Ukraine?
Russian President Vladimir Putin has a very big problem with Ukraine.
The West and Ukraine have repeatedly accused Putin of arming the rebels in eastern Ukraine and sending Russian troops to Ukrainian soil.
That's why the West has imposed sanctions on Russia.
With Ukraine's situation deteriorating, Western countries are planning to impose more stringent sanctions on Russia.
Russia, however, has a power map: winter is coming, and Russia is the main source of energy for Ukraine.
According to the American Energy Agency, Ukraine's primary energy sources are natural gas (40 percent) and coal (28 percent), according to Geysar Gurbanov of Harvard University.
When winter arrives in Ukraine in less than four months and the coal mines are located in the country's conflict-ridden east, Ukrainians are frozen in their homes as gas supplies from Russia run out.
So if the rebels fail to achieve their goal, Gazprom, Russia's energy giant, will help Putin win the war at the end, Gurbanov writes.
Last year, half of the gas used in Ukraine came from Russia.
Russia cut off gas supplies to Ukraine on 16 July due to unpaid bills.
Earlier this month, Gazprom reported that Ukraine's defaulted gas debt was already $5.3 billion (about EUR 4 billion) as of 1 August.
According to The New York Times , Putin commented on the coming winter:
I don't think anyone thinks about it anymore, except Russia, Putin said.
There's always a way to make it easier.
First, the immediate cessation of hostilities and the repair of the necessary infrastructure.
Refurbishing stocks requires necessary repairs and preparation for the cold season.
According to Business Insider, Putin's comments can be interpreted as a threat in disguise.
If the Ukrainian army does not retreat from the separatists, Moscow can use natural gas as a weapon.
Alistair Newman of the Japanese holding company Nomura last month noted that Russian talk about humanitarian intervention and possible planning for a new land crisis in Ukraine would intensify within a few months if Russia can maintain separatist activity until then.
Moscow has already announced that Ukraine will have to pay upfront for gas supplies unless the Kiev sector pays the accumulated debts.
The EU is trying to negotiate a deal that would temporarily allow gas imports to continue.
Last week, Ukrainian Prime Minister Arseniy Jatsenyuk said that Russia plans to halt gas supplies to EU countries in the winter.
Later, Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak said the speeches were unfounded.
He said Russia would do everything it could to get gas supplied to EU countries.
A liberal Saudi blogger was sentenced to 10 years in prison and 1,000 lashes.
The Saudi court upheld a 10-year prison sentence in May for Raif Badaw, the founder of the liberal Free Saudi Liberals movement.
The sentence includes a further fine of one thousand lashes and a fine of one million rials (about EUR 200 000).
The verdict was based on the fact that he had set up a website that defamed Islam.
The verdict was announced Monday by Suad al-Shamari, the organisation's co-founder.
Badawi himself has been held since 2012.
Badawi was sentenced to seven years in prison and 600 lashes in July 2013, but appealed the sentence and was returned for further proceedings.
The ruling was appealed in May, when Amnesty International also noted its injustice.
"It was a revolutionary encounter with people"
Madventures today released a new book, The World's Fair, an Adventure Explanation of Everything.
We asked Riku Rantala to explain the future of the world and the differences between Indian and Finnish culture.
Riku also tells of the most significant human event of his life.
Writer, reporter, other side of Madventures, Riku Shantla is a busy man.
Today, a new book was released, yesterday, a movie picnic at the National Theater, and Wednesday, the second season of Docventures begins at Yale.
He's been running around since this morning.
I'm gonna take the kids to the daycare center and then to the weekly classroom.
The face-to-face interview must be moved to a telephone interview.
Otherwise, I won't have time.
In the midst of all the hustle and bustle of her and the other half of Madventures, Tunna Milonoff has had time to stop and write a book called World Reconciliation, which, according to the book's liner notes, is an adventurer's manual for everything.
- You mean everything?
Oh, that's a lot of promise.
The book explores a number of themes, such as what our future is, why one culture is doing worse than another, why we are here, and who we really are.
We've been using interviews we've been doing for years.
The book has experts, both professors and artists.
We've been actively working on the book for about a year, Riku told ISIS on the phone.
You've been screaming at a book that's pretty big.
What is the central message of the work?
The fact that we need to know more about the world and the big questions is worth considering, because that's when we're doing the best in this world.
On the other hand, the book is meant to be a good travel guide, but it is also meant to get people to discuss and share ideas at home.
Riku says that a conversation can even lead to action.
The film is directed by Pete Treasure-Ahtio.
One of the themes of your book is the future of the world.
What's it look like?
We've come to the conclusion that the human species is optimistic.
Despite global warming and the current state of the earth, we must believe that at some point we will make decisions to improve our situation.
The world is a kind of alcoholic.
First, it should admit that we have a problem, then only then can change happen, philosopher Riku.
According to Riku, some studies show that western mankind reached a peak of happiness in the 1970's.
Since then, getting rich hasn't increased our happiness.
From this we can conclude that when we have enough money and our basic needs are satisfied, we are happy.
Money doesn't bring happiness.
We want to get people to talk about what's enough.
The use of our natural resources will not be enough for this expense for long, Riku says.
You also discussed cultural differences in your book.
How is an Indian different from a Finnish?
People are hardly different.
Of course, the starting points for education, healthcare and hygiene are different.
The biggest cultural difference is that the importance of community is much greater in India for good or ill.
When the West is richer, people live more alone.
Separation can lead to loneliness and anxiety.
When we find the right balance between being in a community and being alone, we're pretty close to happiness, says Riku.
Riku has met many different people around the world.
What encounter with humans has he had in mind the most?
It's set in my childhood, when I was with my family on my first big trip abroad.
We lived in India and Pakistan for a year while my father was there working for the United Nations.
I was seven years old, and I had two younger sisters.
My brother was just a baby, Riku's a kid.
We came home to Finland in a big moving car.
We were driving the war in Afghanistan, when there were huge numbers of refugees on the roadside.
A girl my age was walking down the road, carrying her little brother in her arms.
I was sitting on a big mercury bench with a coke bar in my hand.
We met in the same room, Riku says.
I'm sure that kid of your age understands the situation.
It was one of the most revolutionary human encounters I'll ever remember.
The film is directed by Leena Koskela .
Riku and Tunna at the 2013 book fair.
Then the crime "became to me" that other people should be respected, even if they were significantly poorer or did not have the same living conditions as we do.
And Riku realized that money could not be the measure of human worth.
The memories of adulthood are the ones that come to the surface in New Guinea.
I couldn't stop wondering how people traditionally live there.
They use natural materials for their own benefit, not much money or metal tools.
They live in very challenging living conditions.
It's really hard to survive.
I stopped to think.
And, to think about it, he and Tonna want to get readers to read their new book.
The idea is that our book will inspire people to read, watch and listen more.
So that it would get people to act from warm sex to conversation or even to a boxing match, Riku throws.
The story is in the Cohojock magazine.
The events started when the couple arrived at the station by bus and ordered a taxi.
When the cab was leaving, a man in the yard threw something at the cab.
The driver got out of the car, and so did the man who was a passenger.
The man who threw the object stabbed the male passenger in the head and hand and left the scene.
The knife cutter is a man, a short-haired man, between 170 and 175 centimeters tall.
According to the paper, a young woman with a pink ponytail was near the scene.
We're hoping he contacts the police.
The police are also asking for clues from anyone who may have made observations about the incident or people involved in the incident.
The stabbing occurred on Wednesday, August 27th, at about 7:50 p.m.
"Moi!" said the brain to the brain. The world's first telepathic message went online.
According to an article published in the scientific journal PLoS ONE, an international team of researchers has been the first to successfully convey the message directly to the mind.
The first messages sent through the system were "hello" and "ciao", which means "moi" in Spanish and Italian.
The test procedure observed the electrical conduction of the transmitter.
The program trained the transmitter to transmit beetles by either hand or foot movement.
The image of the foot movement was interpreted as zero, and the movement of the hands as one.
This information, encoded in bits, was sent over the Internet to the recipient.
The receiver was subjected to magnetic stimulation for the observation of light radiation per one bit encoded.
The recipient had been trained to interpret flashes as messages.
While the researchers acknowledge that this is still a child's research field, they believe that computer-aided telepathic communication will become routine in the near future.
Sanctions - Point - Future of rural areas
The EU is preparing new sanctions against Russia.
The United States is also tightening its own sanctions.
Sanctions are a political necessity.
It would be impossible for the EU and the US not to react when Russia goes to war in Ukraine and occupies Crimea.
In international politics, action is followed by reaction, action is followed by counteraction.
Experience shows that all sanctions will only be effective in the long run.
Iran was not able to negotiate its nuclear program until years later.
The South African racial government sat for decades, despite the UN's prohibition on trade.
Sanctions have also been imposed on Russia.
During the Cold War, the Soviet Union was not allowed to export advanced electronics or military technology.
Russia itself has set trade barriers on the world side.
Last thing we saw was a freeze on the wood.
It's clear that sanctions won't bring Russia to its knees.
The Russians are used to bad times and Viola's disappearance from the store will not cause panic.
The EU's intention to ban Russian vodka imports is a joke.
The Russians like to drink that vodka themselves.
The EU sanctions are also selective.
The French are allowed to export aircraft supplies to Russia, but Finland cannot export milk.
The gas flow from Russia to Germany continues.
The biggest disadvantage to Russia is not to stop importing cheese or exporting vodka.
The biggest drawback is the financial sector's constraints.
They'll only affect the future.
The Russian State cannot operate on the international credit market.
It's a long way from cutting old loans, but it's hard to get a new one.
Even though Russia has huge reserves of currency, they too will not last forever.
The credit of Russian companies is falling and the money is going up.
I don't think our own banks can afford to finance everyone.
We need to press the money more or the companies will have a hard time paying.
Bankruptcy is bankruptcy in Russia, too. Russia is a capitalist country.
If the crisis continues for years, Russia's modernization will stop, as Russian expert René Nyberg wrote in the Helsinki Report.
It wouldn't be the first time.
Gradually, Russia would once again become Russia and be caught in.
An exceptional free-expression event was held in North Korea
Some 10,000 North Koreans and a group of diplomats attended the international free-exercise matches in the capital Pyongyang on Saturday.
The event was organized by Antonio Inoki, a Japanese lawyer who had moved from being a freelancer to being a lawyer.
In addition to the weightlifting matches, local athletes also competed in taekwondo.
Inok said the goal of the event was to bring the conflicting nations closer together through sport and promote world peace.
In their speeches, the politicians hoped for a recovery between North Korea and Japan.
Japan lifted the sanctions it had imposed on North Korea in the summer following Japanese abductions in the 1970s and 1980s.
North Korea, for its part, has promised to reopen the investigation into those cases.
The last time North Korea saw international freedom of movement was in 1995.
The SOK will reduce its staff from the use of commodities organisation to around 110.
The negotiations on the draft agreement began in June and the reduction level was estimated at a maximum of 130.
The company said that overlapping activities have now been removed from its organisation and that its responsibilities have been clarified.
The SOK claims that it is seeking to achieve significantly better cost-effectiveness and synergies between different sectors.
In addition to the economic downturn and the decline in consumer demand, the background is a change in the structure of trade, which has shaken up trade in mainly used goods.
The S-Group's profit on the use of commodities has been losing for some time.
The IT negotiations involved all SOK's operational and day-to-day supply staff and management, or a total of about 530 persons.
The Best of Luck: Some of the self-medication behind the counter
According to the magazine, there are more drugs coming between prescription and self-prescribed medicines, which you can get without a prescription, but only after consulting a pharmacist.
The Finnish Pharmaceutical Association suggests that eye drops containing antibiotics, for example, could be considered for advice.
After an interview with the pharmacist or pharmacist and following the pre-defined criteria, the drug should be given behind the counter, says Kirsi Kvarnström, President of the Pharmaceutical Association in Turun Sanom.
In Finland, there are already a few medicines available without a prescription but which require advice.
One of these is a contraceptive.
Corruption to a More Specific Cause
Finland is paying more attention to the fight against corruption.
It has been recommended by both the OECD and the Council of Europe, because the world is amazed at the lack of bribery cases and sentences in Finland.
The Justice Department's task force will consider, by the end of the year, whether there is a need for provisions on trafficking in and abuse of power in the criminal code.
The legal differences were highlighted, for example, in the Slovenian-Slovenia bribery case in Hämeenlinn a year ago.
The trade in influence has resulted in a two-year prison sentence for a former prime minister in Slovenia, but Finnish law does not know of a similar criminal offence.
The Anti-Corruption Cooperation Network has intensified its cooperation as required by the Government programme.
A recent survey shows that corruption is rarely investigated in Finland.
The Ministry of Justice has now ordered a report from Vaasa University and the Police Professionals' College on corruption in various fields.

Wanderers coach Tony Popovic believes he can get the winners for the Asian Champions League fight in Korea
Tony Popovic is missing three key players in Korea.
Many Western Sydney Wanderers players are banned from the first game, and coach Tony Popovic is not hesitant to throw other players into the Asian Champions League's wizarding pool for the FC Seoul game.
The Wanderers are in Dubai for a 10-day training camp, which will also include two friendly matches in Abu Dhabi, to prepare for the team's first semi-final on 17 September.
Because of the yellow cards, Tomi Juric, Brendan Santalab and Shannon Cole are missing out on their Korean tour, but Coach Popovic believes their fans are lucky.
"Of course this is a loss, they have been three very important players in the ACL for us", Popovic says.
Tom Juric was banned from gambling in China for this act.
It's a setback, and none of the players should be out, but we didn't have Matty (Spiranovic) in the first game, and so far Daniel Mullen has been injured.
Whoever comes in as a replacement, I'm sure he's worked hard, and I have complete confidence in the whole team.
I'm not afraid to play anyone in the semifinals.
The Wanderers will also have to be without Spiranovic, who is still recovering from his ankle surgery.
The Socceroos defender was injured before the start of the season, but has continued to run, and it is possible that he will play in a replay at Pirtek Stadium on October 1.
"He's back on the road and he's recovering well", Popovic says.
She's following her own training program and is going to Dubai with us, which is great news for her because it means gradually returning to the field.
He's practiced outdoors a couple of times already, which is good.
It's gonna be a while before he's completely fine, but he's recovering fine.
In Dubai, the Wanderers have the world's top facilities at the Al Sheba Sports Complex.
Popovic also said the trip to Dubai is a good opportunity for the team to get to know each other better after the big changes at the end of last season.
"We know that this will certainly help players to form bonds", Popovic says.
We have a lot of new players, and this is a great opportunity for them to get to know each other even better, both on and off the field.
So we're using the camp for a lot of purposes.
An elite burger pays three times the monthly wage of a worker.
In North Korea, you can enjoy the luxury of a rich economy if you happen to be part of the country's elite.
The Financial Times reports that the economy is ripped apart by adversaries.
In North Korea, the informal market may be flourishing more than ever.
They offer wealthy or savvy ordinary citizens a luxury that is not commonly associated with a dictatorial state.
The Financial Times has visited Munsu Water Park, a recreation center that costs a single ticket up to ten months' wages for a regular worker.
It's a place to get hamburgers for $76.
That's three to five months' wages for a commoner in the country.
In the pool, men drink beer in their shorts.
Life seems expensive and comfortable.
North Korea's "Western markets" began in the 1990s, when the country was suffering from famine.
The government allows them to exist, even when the prices of supplies can be at their worst.
Yet, in the capital, Pyongyang, many people have a cell phone that costs $200.
The role may be that of the ruler Kim Jong-un, 31, who has tried to create an image of himself as energetic and young.
Under his leadership, the government has emphasized the importance of technology in the country's prosperity.
The book fair in Turin is moving from France to Sastama
The themes of the Turku book fair, which will be held in early October, are France and Sastamala.
French literature is represented by authors such as Andrei Makine, Katherine Pancol, Gregoire Delacourt and Michele Lesbre.
The French culture is also described by Helena Petäistö, a correspondent who published her travelogue.
The Department of Agriculture offers a tour of Mr. Hakkaraisen's house and Wanha's literary days.

The Council of Stormont is hopeful that it has found a buyer for the Ormiston House in Belfast, which paid taxpayers almost £3,000 a week.
The Council bought a 19th-century building in the east of the city 13 years ago at a cost of £9 million.
The Council was unable to sell the building further, and the building's security and maintenance were to be paid to the Council for around £400 a day.
The building was sold for £1.25 million the other day.
It's likely to be used as a private residence.
The Council purchased a historic grade B building for £9 million in 2001 because it needed more office space.
However, it was later found that the building was not suitable for this purpose.
Ten years after the purchase, the building was put back on the market at a price of £2.5 million.
The building was not for sale, and the price was lowered.
Last year, Ulster Unionist Mike Nesbitt suggested that Ormiston House might be suitable for a new international trauma center.
The Council has now confirmed that it is negotiating the sale of the building.
The representative said the building will be transferred to the new owner once the paperwork is complete.
Both the Council and the real estate broker remain silent on the buyer's identity and sale price.
The weekly security and repair costs at the Ormiston House are about £3,000.
The Council bought the building from the police force, which preceded the Northern Ireland Police Board.
The security costs of Ormiston House at the beginning of this year totalled £885 641 and the maintenance costs £371 379.
The cost of professional repair and maintenance services was £250,015, and the remuneration of development and design professionals was £212,466.
The building was previously owned by shipbuilder Sir Edward Harland, who lived in the building until 1887, when it was bought by Harland's business partner William Pirrie, who later became president of Harland & Wolff.
Soon after Lord Pirri's death in 1924, Harland & Wolff became the owner of the building, which was sold in 1928 to Campbell College, who owned it until the mid-1970s.
'Inequality rises': Helsinki plans to reduce school attendance
The JHL claims that there is no savings.
In Helsinki, preparations are underway for a radical reduction in the number of school attendance assistants.
The reduction would not affect the child's personal assistant.
The Helsinki Board of Education decided to submit a total of about 2.7 million grants for school attendance assistants in the spring.
In total, there are about 600 school attendance assistants in Helsinki.
If the reductions are implemented, they shall enter into force at the beginning of the academic year.
The trade union JHL says the decision adds to the inequality.
More and more children need support to learn.
However, it is unfortunate that the aid is easy to reduce for savings reasons, as the amount of aid for learning is not clearly defined by law.
The savings are not necessarily achieved, but rather the workload of the teaching staff is increased.
School savings are increasingly at risk of falling behind learning objectives and teachers are also struggling, stresses JHL's Director of the Agency, Päivi Niemi-Laine.
The City of Helsinki's plans are disproportionate to schools, as future resources will no longer provide support to small schools and students in need.
The city of Helsinki's goal is to prevent exclusion.
It is the school attendance assistants who are doing the most effective prevention work.
However, the adjustment measures of the Education Agency are mostly directed to this group.
This will affect all parties involved in the future.
The final decision will be taken in the autumn by the Helsinki City Council, which I hope will have the vision and wisdom to look ahead and act in line with its objectives, Niemi-Laine says.
Israel takes over the West Bank
Israelite women are walking in a Jewish temple called Gevaoth in the settlement of Ezion near Bethlehem.
Israel seized nearly 400 hectares of land on the West Bank near Bethlehem on Sunday, which may be a sign of Israel's future major reconstruction in the region, while challenging the Palestinian request not to build more settlements and challenging the general opinion of the world community.
The Israeli group Peace Now, which opposes the expansion of settlements in the West Bank, believed that Sunday's events could be the largest single land occupation in the West Bank in decades and could dramatically change the situation in the region.
The Palestinians' goal is to establish a state of their own in the countries that Israel conquered in 1967.
The Israeli authorities said the political challenge to assess the situation in the land area came after three Israeli youths were kidnapped and killed in June after they were lifted from the area.
In July, Israeli authorities arrested a Palestinian accused of being the main suspect in the kidnappings and murders.
The timing of the land seizure suggests that it was intended as a kind of compensation to the settlement population and as a punishment for the Palestinians.
The land near the Jewish settlement of Gevaot, in the Etzion settlement area of southern Jerusalem, has now been officially declared 'State Land' after previously being privately owned by the Palestinians.
But Ahmad Lafi, mayor of the nearby Palestinian town of Surifi, said the land belongs to Palestinian families.
He told the official Palestinian news agency WAFL that the Israeli army and its staff issued orders early on Sunday announcing that Israel had taken over the lands containing olive and other tree crops in Surif and nearby Al-Jabaan and Wadi Fukin.
Any objections shall be submitted within 45 days.
The kidnapping of young people led the Israeli army to execute a retaliatory operation in the West Bank against the Hamas group, which Israel says is behind the kidnappings.
The tensions that followed on the Israeli-Gaza border led to a 50-day war that ended last week with the Egyptian-led ceasefire.
The occupation of the land has quickly brought attention to the Israeli-held West Bank and exposed the conflicting goals of the Israeli government that hinder the wider development of the Israeli-Palestinian peace process.
The crisis in Lapland is usually multi-problematic
An increasing number of municipalities in Lapland are in trouble, according to a well-being study by the University of Lapland and the Lapland School of Professional Studies.
There are no quick solutions to the problems of crisis communities.
According to the professor, reducing the municipal tasks by a billion euros is not enough.
The common features of crisis communities include a weak municipal economy, poor employment and displacement.
As Asko Suikkasen, professor emeritus of sociology at the University of Lapland, said, new crisis forces are coming from the western border and from the eastern border.
In the survey, residents assessed their local situation quite realistically.
In the study, residents of well-off communities were even pessimistic about the outlook.
The high expectations affect consumption.
People hope that the present conditions and well-being will survive, perhaps even improve somewhat.
At this time, it is not worth thinking about longer-term investments, such as buying a home, says Suikkanen.
The team was surprised by the huge differences between the municipalities.
For example, the cost of living allowances per capita varies from a couple of months to well over 100 euros.
The tax revenue received per inhabitant in the municipality varies from EUR 2 000 in the Ranau judgment to EUR 4400 in Pelkosenniem.
According to the suiker, the municipalities of Lapland are different.
How the money is spent, how much government contributions are made and what the level of indebtedness is, is very different in municipalities in similar situations, he says.

Britain may close its borders to returning Islamist fighters
Britain may temporarily prevent the return of Islamic militants from Iraq and Syria.
The BBC is reporting the incident, citing government sources.
However, the BBC said British citizens suspected of terrorism could retain their citizenship.
According to the government source, this is one of many proposals that are being considered.
The proposal is currently being finalised and is due to be tabled by Prime Minister David Cameron.
The government is also looking for ways to make it harder for potential fighters to travel abroad.
One way might be to increase the powers of the authorities so that they can temporarily confiscate passports of potential fighters at the border.
On Friday, Britain raised the possibility of a terrorist attack to the second highest level.
Bob Carr is pleased to announce the immediate release of Australian lawyer Melinda Taylor from a Libyan prison.
Australian lawyer Melinda Taylor is expected to be released from a Libyan prison today.
The federal government has welcomed the news that Libyan authorities are expected to release Australian lawyer Melinda Taylor today.
Foreign Secretary Bob Carr's spokesman said that everything was going well and that the International Criminal Court lawyer would be released to the Australian authorities tonight, after which he would board a plane flying to Europe by midnight.
"We are pleased to hear that he is likely to be released today", a spokesman told the AAP news agency in New York.
We thank the Libyan authorities for their cooperation.
Australia also thanks the wider international community for its help and support, the spokesperson said.
Taylor will probably be flying to Rome before heading home to The Hague.
Taylor and three of his criminal court lawyers were arrested in the Libyan city of Zintan on June 7 while representing Seif al-Islam, the son of former Libyan dictator Muammar Gaddafi.
According to the Libyan authorities, Taylor took to Seif documents that they believe threatened national security.
Senator Carr has worked hard to get Taylor out of prison, including traveling to the Libyan capital Tripoli last month to pursue this case.
Taylor couldn't speak to her husband or her little daughter until last week.
Senator Carr said Taylor was allowed to make a short call to her home in The Hague shortly after the visit of Australian Ambassador David Ritchie.
Carr also spoke to Taylor's parents, John and Janelle, who live in Brisbane, and were relieved to learn that Taylor was finally allowed to use her phone.
Taylor's parents had appealed to Libya to release their daughter before her little one's third birthday in July.
The other three criminal court lawyers arrested are from Lebanon, Russia and Spain.
Carr said a week ago that as a result of a discussion between the lawyer released in The Hague and the Libyan authorities, the lawyer of the Criminal Court regretted and apologized for the possible misunderstanding.
The ICC has not spoken of any mistakes, but has promised to thoroughly investigate the actions of its team once its members return home.
The International Criminal Court's investigation will ensure that all those who have done wrong are brought to justice, the Court said in a statement last month.
The International Criminal Court is demanding trial of 39-year-old Seif al-Islam for crimes against humanity during his father's term in office, which ended abruptly last year.
Tripoli said that his trial should be local and took the initiative on 1 May, announcing that it would not approve the decision of the Criminal Court's counsel to hold the trial in The Hague.
A young man who came to Barcelona saved his life .
Barcelona won their second title in the early stages of the Spanish football league, but Villarreal did not easily fall at home.
The red-haired guys shot Villarreal guard Sergio Asenjo in the head until the 82nd minute finally came to a head.
The surprise man who scored the winning goal was 19-year-old Sandro Ramirez, who had made his La Liga debut, coming on the field just 12 minutes earlier.
A young man who received an invitation to the Barcelona squad for the second team finished close to the finish after Asenjo had rejected Lionel Mess's bid.
The collection of the Ferguson police mysteriously ended after a $433,000 surplus.
Supporters shut down two online collection sites without explanation this weekend after the sites raised over $400,000 for a police officer who shot an unarmed 18-year-old in Ferguson, Missouri.
On the GoFundMe charity website, which is open to the general public, two separate pages with similar names   Support Officer Darren Wilson and  Support Officer Wilson have raised $235,750 and $197,620 for the Ferguson police officer who shot Michael Brown.
A similar website run by the Brown family's lawyer had raised $314,099 since Sunday afternoon.
The shooting was followed by weeks of unrest and protests against the mostly black police force of Ferguson, which forced Wilson into hiding while local and federal investigations were trying to determine whether he shot Brown for no reason.
Online campaign raises some concerns about Wilson's defense, especially after some visitors to the site posted racist comments in the comment section that have since been removed.
Apparently, both sites stopped accepting donations at about the same time on Saturday, and the site's owners gave no reason for this.
When a visitor tries to make a donation to the site, he sees a message saying, "Donations will no longer be accepted!"
The organizer has stopped collecting donations.
A spokesperson for GoFundMe told the Los Angeles Times on Sunday that the site has not stopped donations.
Each GoFundMe campaign organizer decides for himself when to stop receiving donations, said GoFundMe spokeswoman Kelsea Little in a press release.
The organisers may also continue to receive donations at a later date if they wish.
Support Officer Wilson, which generated $197,620, is run by the St. Louis Police Department's charity Shield of Hope, which is a GoFundMe-approved donor.
Three police officers named to the Shield of Hope State Collection Register, Joseph Eagan, Timothy Zoll and Jeffrey Roorda, did not immediately respond to emails requesting more information about the collection campaign on Sunday.
Zoll is the official spokesman for the Ferguson Police Department, Eagan is a member of the nearby Florissant City Council and Roorda is a member of the Missouri House of Representatives.
The Times also did not immediately contact the anonymous founder of Support Officer Darren Wilson, who uses the name Stand Up and has raised $235,750.
However, a GoFundMe spokesperson assured The Times in a statement that an anonymous philanthropist exists.
Unlike the administrators of another Wilson page or the Brown donation site, little information has been given to donors about the anonymous donor of the campaign.
An anonymous Wilson page benefactor wrote a message to visitors two weeks ago saying that the site is working with the Shield of Hope group to be officially recognized as a donor.
The approval has not yet been given.
The beneficiary provided additional information to the visitors using a Gmail email address in the password, but did not immediately respond to a request for additional information on Sunday.
A GoFundMe spokesperson told The Times that the anonymous collection page had been removed from the search results of the main site and added that the campaign no longer meets the GoFundMe website's requirements for an active Facebook account.
The GoFundMe website's privacy practices urge users to only donate to GoFundMe users they know personally and trust.
Unfortunately, there is no guarantee that the content of the collection page published on the GoFundMe website is accurate and honest.
However, according to Representative Little, GoFundMe is in close contact with the campaign organiser and has no reason to doubt his honesty.
The GoFundMe may also withhold any funds raised if it is necessary to initiate investigations in connection with a campaign.
However, GoFundMe did not consider it appropriate to withhold the funds raised for the campaign in question.
A popular Facebook page Support Officer Wilson, which has been running campaigns in support of Wilson, told followers of the page over the weekend that lawyers were trying to find out why donors to the GoFundMe site have been prevented from donating, but the page gave no further information.
The Facebook page also has an anonymous administrator and no independent source has been able to confirm these comments.
Arsenal 's top striker for the rest of the year .
English Premier League striker Olivier Giroud is likely to be out until the turn of the year.
Giroudi's ankle was amputated on Wednesday and it takes months to recover.
Giroud injured his leg at the weekend of the Premier League against Everton.
The operation went well, but he's on the sidelines until he can play at the top level, until the end of December or early January, Arsenal head coach Arsene Wenger told Sky Sports.
Giroud was Arsenal's top scorer last season with 16 goals, so the loss is a feeling.
However, according to Wenger, he did not necessarily get a place for Giroud during this transfer window.
Wenger has just been able to buy Alexis Sanchez in the top spot of the Champions League qualifying round against Besiktas on Wednesday.
Arsenal won 1-0 on goal from Sanchez.

Central Finnish: Finns trust in the security of online banking
Most Finns trust the security of online banking, reports the Central Finn.
According to a survey by the newspaper, four out of five people believe that cybersecurity is good.
The age of the respondents is clearly seen in the answers.
The young people who believe the most in the security of online banking, the fewest retirees.
The consumer union's chief lawyer, Tuula Sario, was not surprised by the views.
Many Internet users usually rely the most on its services.
And those who do not use the services are ignorant and suspicious, he thinks in Central Finland.
Most Finns are customers of some online bank.
Most people do business on a computer, but mobile devices are becoming more common.
A survey by Tietoykönen Oy was carried out in August by a thousand Finns.
The margin of error is three percentage points.
