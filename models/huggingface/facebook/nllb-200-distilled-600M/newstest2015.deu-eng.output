The prime ministers of India and Japan met in Tokyo.
India's new Prime Minister Narendra Modi is meeting his Japanese counterpart Shinzo Abe in Toko on his first major foreign visit since his election victory in May to discuss economic and security relations.
Mr Modi is on a five-day trip to Japan to strengthen economic relations with the world's third largest economy.
Plans for greater nuclear cooperation are high on the agenda.
India is also reportedly hoping for a defence cooperation agreement between the two nations.
Karratha police arrest 20-year-old for fast motorcycle chase
A motorcycle was seized after the driver drove it at 125 km/h in a 70 km/h zone and through bushland to escape the police in Bilbara.
Traffic police in Karratha tried to stop a blue motorcycle this morning after watching it leave a gas station on Bathdate Road at 125 km/h.
Police report that the driver then ignored the stop signs and continued on Burgess Road before heading to the bus land where officials lost sight of it.
The motorcycle and a person who matched the description of the driver were later seen near a house on Walcott Way in Bulgaria.
Karratha police have charged a 20-year-old man with disregarding a stop sign and reckless driving.
He is scheduled to appear in the Karratha District Court on September 23.
The motorcycle was seized and confiscated for three months.
George Webster charged with hotel rape in Naim and Pitlochry
A man is on trial for raping women in two hotels.
George Webster, 28, was read out at a hearing by the High Court in Glasgow.
He is accused of raping a woman at Scotland's Hotel in Pitlochry, Perthshire, on 7 June 2013.
The charge is that Webster attacked her while she was "unconscious, asleep, and unable to signal consent".
Webster is also accused of raping a second woman at the Golf View Hotel in Naim, Scotland on May 4, 2014.
Justice Lady Rae has set a hearing date of 17 November at the High Court in Edinburgh.
The European Parliament has also adopted a resolution on the need for a European Parliament to be able to take action.
Congressmen Keith Ellison and John Lewis have introduced a bill to establish the organization of unions as civil law.
"As unions die, so do middle-class workers", said Ellison, a Democrat from Minnesota and vice chairman of the Progressive Caucus in Congress.
I am therefore proud to present the Employee Empowerment Act together with the civil rights icon John Lewis.
This groundbreaking law gives workers the same legal options for discrimination on grounds of trade union organisation as in other forms of discrimination - and thus stops anti-trade union forces.
The Commission has also proposed that the Commission should take the necessary measures to ensure that the measures taken are not distorted by the Member States.
But it is certainly not a radical initiative - at least not by American standards.
In fact, the best way to understand what Ellison, Lewis and the other sponsors of their bill are proposing is to link back to a very American idea.
Despite the setbacks that unions have faced in recent years - in Wisconsin, Michigan and other states across the country - Americans have once encouraged countries around the world to recognize, expand and uphold labor rights.
There was a time when millions of Americans still remember when this country called democracy, freedom of speech, freedom of the press and the right to unite in one breath.
When the United States occupied Japan after World War II, General Douglas Mac Arthur and his staff encouraged the country to adopt a constitution that would ensure that the militarized autocracy of Hedki Tojos would be replaced by democracy.
Fully aware that the workers and their unions were playing a role in creating a new Japan, they used language that explicitly recognized that "the rights of workers to unite and to negotiate and act together are guaranteed".
When the United States occupied Germany after World War II, General Dwight David Eisenhower and his staff urged the Germans to write a constitution that would ensure that Adolf Hitler's fascism was replaced by a strong democracy.
Recognizing that the workers would have to organise and raise their voice in the new nation, the Germans added a clause that explicitly stated: "The right to form associations to secure and improve working and economic conditions is guaranteed to every individual and to every profession or trade.
Agreements which restrict or reduce this right are null and void; measures aimed at this right are unlawful.
When former First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt chaired the International Commission on Human Rights, which drafted the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, as adopted by the United Nations as a global treaty in 1948, Roosevelt and the other authors added a guarantee that "everyone has the right to form or join trade unions to protect his interests".
For generations, Americans have accepted the basic premise that labor rights are human rights.
When this country advised other countries on how to form civil and democratic societies, Americans declared that the right to form a union - and then to have that union participate in collective bargaining as an equal partner with businesses and government agencies - must be protected.
In fact, after these rights have been undermined in America, it is very wise to reconsider the American ideal that the working population must have the right to unite and to be heard in a free and open society.
As Pastor Martin Luther King Jr. said 50 years ago:
History is a great teacher.
Now everyone knows that the workers' movement did not limit the strength of the nation, but increased it.
By raising the standard of living of millions of people, labor has miraculously created a market for industry and elevated the entire nation to unimaginable levels of production.
Those who attack work forget these simple truths, but history preserves them.
History remembers, and so should we.
The formal recognition of labour rights as human rights and the extension of the protection of civil rights as protection against discrimination in the creation of workers' representations are long overdue.
Keith Ellison and John Lewis are renewing the ideals that made America great in the past and fulfilled the promise of democracy.
Judge stops temporary law that could force all abortion clinics in Louisiana to close
A federal judge on Sunday temporarily suspended the implementation of a law in Louisiana that lawyers say would have likely led to the closure of all five abortion clinics in the state.
This measure, signed into law by Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal in June and scheduled to take effect on September 1, would force doctors who perform abortions to acquire a patient admissions license from a hospital within a 30-mile radius of their practice.
However, the judge's decision means that doctors can continue to legally perform abortions while they apply for such a right.
"The plaintiffs can continue to work in accordance with the law while they strive to obtain these rights", wrote Federal Judge John deGravelles in his judgment.
Within one month, a hearing shall be convened for the judge to bring a more permanent decision to the law.
Abortion advocates welcomed the decision, the latest in a series of judgments against similar measures, saying that this would buy doctors more time to earn hospital admission rights.
"Today's decision means that women in Louisiana are escaping a fraudulent law that wants to take away their health and rights", said Nancy Northup, president and chair of the Center for Reproductive Rights, which has filed a lawsuit on behalf of three of the state's five clinics to stop the law.
It was not immediately clear whether the judgment also applied to the doctors from the two clinics who did not join the action and who had also applied for admission rights.
Louisiana is one of 11 states to have passed similar laws, with courts in Alabama and Mississippi recently declaring such measures unconstitutional.
Key sections of a Texas law that would have forced the closure of most of the remaining hospitals in the state were stopped by a federal judge on Friday.
Abortion advocates and the American College of Ostretricians and Gynecologists and the American Medical Association agree that medical admission requires unnecessary restrictions.
Opponents of abortion reject the idea that the measures are designed to protect women's health, although some have also welcomed the impact of closing clinics.
Only one doctor who performs abortions in Louisiana has patient admission rights, the Center for Reproductive Rights said.
If all other doctors in the state were forced to stop performing abortions, this doctor would not perform the surgery for fear of his safety, the group said.
In their argument against the verdict, Louisiana state officials said they would not punish doctors for performing abortions while their applications for patient admission rights were pending.
Delayed diagnoses and lack of access to the best treatment options lead to higher ovarian cancer death rates in rural areas.
Angelina Jolie and her brother James posted a video tribute to her mother, who died of ovarian cancer in 2007.
Women in rural Australia are at a higher risk of dying from ovarian cancer than women in cities.
Researchers analyzed medical data from more than 1,100 Australian women diagnosed with ovarian cancer in 2005 and found that only 25 percent were still alive five years after diagnosis.
Research director Susan Jordan of the QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute said that for those living in rural and remote areas of the state, the risk of mortality during the study was 20 percent higher than for those living in urban areas.
Smaller study: New drugs could slow lung and ovarian cancer
The researchers studied the women's medical care over seven years.
Dr. Jordan said that a woman's age at diagnosis, type of ovarian cancer, pre-existing conditions, and social and economic status also affected her chances of survival.
The survival rate was lowest among older women and those whose cancer had progressed further by the time they were diagnosed.
For those living in rural and remote areas of the state, the risk of mortality during the study was 20 percent higher than for those living in urban areas.
Although the study did not investigate why women living outside the city were more likely to die from ovarian cancer, Dr. Jordan speculates that delayed diagnosis and lack of access to the best treatment centers may be factors.
"This disease is best treated by gynecological oncologists, and these are mostly found in larger cities", she said.
Despite the improvement in telemedicine services to address distance, she suggested that as a possible remedy, the services of inbound doctors should be strengthened to enable specialists to provide women with closer care in their home areas, as well as treatment programmes for people outside their region.
Dr. Jordan said that the study, regardless of geographic status, showed a poor long-term survival rate among women with ovarian cancer, and stressed the need for better treatment and prevention strategies.
The study, funded by Rio Tinto Ride to Conquer Cancer, is being published today in the Medical Journal of Australia.
In March 2013, Elisha Neave, a 33-year-old mother from the Gold Coast, learned that she had an aggressive form of ovarian cancer.
Garden centers regret falling homeownership
The decline, coupled with a sharp decline in the number of homeowners under 35, could cause garden centers to lose tens of thousands of pounds a year if today's young consumers reach the "garden product core group", according to a study by HTA, as reported in the Financial Times.
The report says that tenants spend an average of 55 percent of the amount that people with homes spend on their garden.
The rise in people living in highly urbanized areas without gardens, the popular methods of paving gardens for parking purposes and the declining garden size are other factors threatening the industry, which has an estimated £5 billion in annual sales.
In Greater London, where the share of homeowners has fallen from 61% to 43% over a period of six years, the lowest expenditure per household is reported on garden products.
The HTA and the Royal Horticultural Society point out that rental housing or small gardens do not mean that people cannot grow plants.
Guy Barter, chief gardening consultant for the RHS, said: "Container gardeners, for example, are very popular with tenants because they can take their plants with them when they move".
The HTA report identified the period between 1997 and 2005 as the 'golden age' of garden retail due to the increasing number of homeowners and economic prosperity from the late 1980s to the mid-1990s.
It also forecast an improved market situation for this year due to better weather after adverse weather conditions in March and April last year.
The protest movement in Pakistan led by opposition politician Imran Khan and cleric Tahirul Qadri continues.
In the capital Islamabad, about 1,000 protesters stormed the state-run PTV.
But the information minister, Pervaiz Rashid, said soldiers could have pushed the protesters out of PTV buildings.
The station stopped operating for about 40 minutes, but is now rebroadcasting.
At the same time, about 3,000 protesters tried to reach the residence of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif.
About a mile away, they came in with sticks and stones, and clashed with security forces.
The police used tear gas.
The protesters demanded Sharif's resignation, but he refuses.
The country's army, meanwhile, urges a political solution to the conflict "without wasting time and using no force".
After a meeting at headquarters on Sunday evening, the military announced: "The army remains committed to its role in ensuring the security of the state".
The military plays an important role in Pakistan and has already been putsching more often.
Opposition politician Imran Khan accuses Prime Minister Sharif of cheating in the parliamentary elections in May last year.
The protests escalated over the weekend after Khan and Qadri urged their supporters to storm Sharif's residence.
Three people were killed.
Turkey orders US diplomat for reporting espionage
The Turkish Foreign Ministry has recruited the country's most senior US diplomats to report on American and British espionage in Turkey.
Deputy Prime Minister Bülent said the US Embassy's business manager and Turkish officials discussed the report on Monday.
The German magazine Der Spiegel and the online magazine The Intercept reported that the findings of former US National Security Agency analyst Edward Snowden show that Turkey was a major area of activity for US and UK intelligence.
According to Turkish news agencies, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan understated the importance of the report and said that all the important countries were spying on each other.
An earlier report that even Germany's top intelligence agency targeted Ankara caused a much more angry reaction from the Turkish government.
Warning: Truck drivers threatened with consequences for commuters
The national warning strike by the lorry drivers on Monday evening could also affect passenger traffic in NRW.
The suspension announced for 6pm to 9pm will affect all transport companies nationwide, including long-distance, regional and suburban transport.
The main focus of the warning strike is the freight traffic.
The Commission has also adopted a number of measures to combat fraud.
The German railway company, the German railway company, is the largest railway company in the world.
We expect significant outages.
Regional priorities are not available.
The main focus of the warning strike was on freight.
The Deutsche Bahn in NRW announced that it would do everything possible to minimise the impact.
However, the GDL did not say where it intended to strike, so it was difficult to predict the consequences.
Magaluf police chief charged with corruption
Prosecutors presented evidence of blackmail by police and officials of the city of Calvià to the Prosecutor's Office in Mallorca on Friday.
The police chief of Calvià on the holiday island of Mallorca was arrested on corruption charges by businessmen and bar owners at the infamous binge drinking hotspot Magaluf.
Chief Commissioner José Antonio Navarro was arrested on corruption charges by several businessmen from Punta Ballena, the street where most of Magaluf's bars and nightclubs are located.
According to the online newspaper Mallorca Diario, prosecutors presented evidence of blackmail by police and Calvià city employees to the Mallorca State's anti-corruption prosecutor's office on Friday.
Two other local police officers were arrested by the Spanish Civil Guard in connection with the corruption charges and are being questioned by a judge along with Navarro.
The Spanish daily ABC reported that the angry nightclub owners said the authorities' cousin business had a serious impact on their business.
"It's not about making money anymore, it's about survival", one of the businessmen told the court.
Let our livelihoods be out of the game.
We have nothing to lose.
Magaluf made international headlines this summer with a viral YouTube video showing an 18-year-old British tourist who was executing 24 men during a drinking tour.
Since then, the island authorities have tried to stop the illegal behavior of alcoholic holidaymakers in Magaluf by minimizing the number of participants in the infamous drunken bar tours.
The Playhouse Club, where the felony took place, was forced to close for a year, while Playhouse and pub tour organizer Carnage jointly pay a fine of €55,000 ($73,000).
Magaluf, a popular tourist destination for young British holidaymakers, is also known for several alcohol-related accidents, including the trend of "balconying", where people jump from balcony to balcony or from balcony to hotel pool.
The first day of spring with wet and stormy weather is affecting flights from Adelaide Airport
FREUHLING has brought a winter surprise to South Australia, with heavy shocks and strong winds hampering flights from Adelaide Airport.
By 9 p.m. another 5 mm of rain had fallen on the city, down from 6.6 mm that had already fallen on Sunday night.
The last rainfall was the result of a series of short, stormy shocks, including a gusso that started just before 8 p.m. and caused almost 4mm of rain in about 10 minutes.
After winter last week provided an early dose of spring, temperatures in the city returned to a peak of only 15.8°C on Monday.
The bad weather conditions likely caused a delayed landing of a Virgin Airlines flight from Melbourne to Adelaide.
The plane was supposed to land shortly after 7.30 p.m., but was hit by a gale - a sudden change in wind speed or direction over a short distance - and had to take off.
Wind gusts reached about 50 km/h on the ground at Adelaide Airport at this time.
The flight data showed that the plane had to take off again on a second landing and finally set off at about 8:40 p.m.
The delay in the flight subsequently led to delays on several other flights, including an Emirates flight from Dubai and a Quantas flight from Sydney.
Adelaide is forecast to have a maximum temperature of 16°C on Tuesday, with possible showers.
Matthies says it's time for the big network
In the face of the rapid technological advances that threaten to turn our comfortable home into high-tech switching centers, our columnist Bernd Matthies is comforted by a highly trusted electronic accessory.
As I write this, I look at the wire that connects the listener to the phone, and I think, "Boah, how retro is that?"
But there's a thought behind this: If it wasn't for the cable, all the listeners would be flying around the house in no time, and that would be even more retro.
The Commission has already adopted a proposal for a directive on the protection of workers' rights.
No, typo: electronic) sector the rule that the world's novelty of today is tomorrow's electrical waste, bought - outdated.
And for example, if you have a TV in your living room today, you're simply saying that you basically refuse to watch TV.
Why do you think so?
Because the IFA's pushing the radio tower this week again shows us our absolute incompetence in electronics.
The layman who once dominated the washing machine and the CD player blindly does not even understand the purpose of the devices that are being spread before him with an incredibly vain expert speech: "Connected home, wearables, health care and urban technologies", the press office promises.
Yeah, you all right?
What are you talking about with people who seem to be willing to spread such quark?
Basically, for about 20 years now, it's been about connecting our homes.
So the yogurt can be ordered back, so the firefighter on vacation in the Maldives can tell us it's burning in the study.
And wouldn't it be wonderful if we left the office with the air conditioning on our way soon...
Yes, but that requires air conditioning.
But a dream is bound to come true soon: We lift our wristwatch, say "Suck!" out loud, and at home the vacuum cleaner starts.
I'm not sure.
It's all about nothing less than a revolution: "The boundaries between white and brown goods blur", says an industry expert, you can connect the washing machine to a headset, the steam generator sends the weather report, and the data glasses show how long the pizza will take in the oven, but nothing helps because we're stuck.
We also know from everyday practice that if a pneumatic device is really needed, the battery is guaranteed to be empty.
Which is another reason why the wiring on the phone will survive the next radio show.
Israeli children return to their schools after the war in Gaza
Thousands of Israeli children from the areas near the Gaza Strip returned to schools on Monday after spending the summer in air shelters as rocket and mortar fire fell on their communities during the 50-day war between Israel and Hamas and schools in Gaza remained closed as the area recovered from fighting.
The start of the school year brought a sense of joy and anticipation to the communities in southern Israel that were hit by rocket fire, but the signs of the fighting are still fresh.
In the southern city of Ashdod, staff at the Pashaosh kindergarten, which was hit by a rocket, removed shrapnel from the walls and sliding walls before the students arrived.
"We're a little scared, but we're excited", said Ronit Bart, a resident of Kibbutz Saad and a teacher of English there.
Many children in our area urgently need to return to a routine.
Her 11-year-old daughter, Shani Bart, said it feels "a little weird" to suddenly go back to school.
"These were difficult times, and we never left the house at all", she said.
President Reuven Rivlin visited the kibbutz near the Gaza border to offer his support.
Until a ceasefire last week interrupted the war, thousands of residents of border communities like Saad remained in their homes or left their homes to move further away from Gaza to safer areas and escape the rocket and mortar fire.
Many residents of Nahal Oz, a village near the Gaza border where a four-year-old boy was killed by a Palestinian mortar shell, are still hesitant to return.
The Ministry of Education said that about a dozen families had not yet returned.
Your children were temporarily placed in other schools.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visited a school in Sderot, a Gaza border town badly hit by Palestinian shelling.
He urged the children to learn a lot and said, "We'll make sure you get knowledge and provide security".
Israel and Hamas agreed on an indefinite ceasefire last Tuesday.
The ceasefire brought an immediate end to the fighting, but important issues remain unresolved, such as Hamas' demand for the lifting of the Israeli-Egyptian blockade of Gaza and the reopening of Gaza's air and sea ports.
Israel is demanding the disarmament of Hamas and the handover of the bodies of two Israeli soldiers killed in the fighting.
A new round of indirect talks is expected to begin in Egypt this month.
More than 2,100 Palestinians were killed in the war, three-quarters of them civilians, and at least 494 children, according to estimates by Palestinians and the UN.
Israel denies this information and estimates that at least half of those killed were fighters, but has not provided any concrete evidence for this information.
On the Israeli side, 66 soldiers and six civilians were killed, including a Thai worker.
Hamas and other Gaza fighters fired 4,591 rockets and mortar shells during the fighting on Israeli cities, most in the south of the country.
Meanwhile, the Israeli military carried out more than 5,000 air and other attacks.
The Israeli attacks damaged or destroyed thousands of homes in the Gaza Strip and some 250,000 people sought refuge in more than 100 UN schools that were converted into temporary shelters.
While tens of thousands of people continue to live in shelters and the fighting continues, the education authorities postponed the start of the school year last week.
"I hope the school will be reopened soon so that we can continue to learn, like the children of the world and the Jewish children", said Mohammad Amara, a 13-year-old boy who currently lives in a school in Gaza City.
After the election in Saxony: CDU Vice-President Strobl challenges the NPD's prohibitory procedures
In view of the NPD's loss of votes in Saxony, the Federal Ombudsman for the CDU, Thomas Strobl, has called for the end of the ongoing NPD prohibiting proceedings before the Federal Constitutional Court.
- Berlin According to the CDU's German expert Thomas Strobl, the ongoing ban on the NPD should be brought to an end in the Federal Constitutional Court.
"The NPD is cutting worse than last time", Strobl, who is also CDU national leader in Baden-Württemberg, told the Leipzig Volkszeitung.
This is a pleasant development in the right direction and one that will lead me to conclude that the NPD is being fought politically and not before the Constitutional Court.
The NPD had narrowly failed in the vote on Sunday on the five-percent barrier.
An initial attempt to ban the far-right party failed in 2003 because the NPD also had informants at the top of the constitutional protection.
In December 2013, after a long period of preparation, the Federal Council submitted a new application in Karlsruhe.
The Federal Government and the Bundestag did not agree.
Harburg: Camps for new refugees
At Newland Square, refugees are now housed in tents.
The first-run refugee centre in Harburg is bursting from every angle.
Now the Home Office has ordered three Red Cross tents set up next door.
The local politicians were briefed just before - they are not very enthusiastic.
"These Hauruck actions further increase citizens' reservations and prevent district politicians from contributing constructively to the humane accommodation of refugees", says Britta Herrmann, Green Party chairwoman at the Harburg District Assembly.
The parties claim that the district administration of Harburg should provide unused housing.
96 refugees can be accommodated in the three tents.
The reasons for the overcrowding in the first-room are the rush of applicants and the fact that the authorities cannot provide enough seats in follow-up facilities.
Many refugees therefore stay longer than the usual three months.
Housing prices have seen their strongest winter rise in seven years, according to a widely observed index.
The RP Data CoreLogic Hedonic Home Value Index for homes in the Australian capital rose 1.1 percent in August, according to Monday's RP data.
This increase brings the overall increase in June, July and August to 4.2%, the largest increase in the winter months since 2007.
The annual price increase was 10.9%, more than double the increase in the 12 months to August 2013, but the increases were not evenly distributed across the country.
Tim Lawless, RP Data's head of research, said Sydney and Melbourne are driving a two-tiered market.
RP Data figures show that house prices in Sydney rose 16.1% last year, compared with 11.7% in Melbourne.
The following markets are Adelaide, Brisbane and Darwin, where prices rose by an average of five and six percent.
At the other end of the scale is Canberra, which has been hit hard by government spending cuts and where prices have risen by only 1.4 percent over the year.
Mr Lawless went on to say that with the beginning of spring, there would now be an increase in properties for sale over the next few months, which would put the market to a "real test".
"If you look at the continuing high rate of auction prices, a generally fast selling rate and the continuing low interest rate environment, it is likely that home prices will rise further in the next three months", he said.
In a statement to the New Press, he contradicts the statements of CEO Peer Medau and attests to his posing "like a general".
The communication states that this is not the style of the university.
The media reported that the Medau family had already been "orally informed about the university's move in mid-June.
The statement that the plans were only announced in July is definitely false", said Pötzl.
At the same time, he points out that the plans are not 'examples or even decisions', but rather 'preferences'.
The expansion of the narrow road leading up to the castle, which is necessary for access, is also less dramatic than the Medes fear.
A nine-meter wide road was and is not mentioned.
It is 5.50 metres, which is one metre wider than it was before", explains Pötzl.
The argument of the Medau operators that their free and school-owned parking space will in future only be used by university students is not accepted by Pötzl.
The Commission has not yet decided on the application of the directive.
Think of the people
The mountain children's crib, located on the grounds and leading to the parking deck in front of the front door, is not to be affected, according to the university president.
Rather, he points out that "this is not only about the children's crib, but also about the residents at the entrance to Friedrich-Streib Street and the 800 pupils of the neighbouring real school.
It is therefore much more than the particular interests of the M. Medau's", says Pötzl.
Whether the parental board's criticism of the crib that the road would be extended would justify the loss of "a few of Coburg's natural remains" "can be decided by the reader himself".
In early October, Pötzl, together with the Bamberg State Building Office, wants to inform the city councils about the construction development of the university by 2020 "and in this context address the importance of the new development".
Peer Medau had informed the parents of the daycare centre about the college's plans last week.
The new parking deck is therefore not to be accessed through the campus and Friedrich-Streib-Straße as before, but through Medau-Berg.
This would require the narrow road to be widened in two lanes over a distance of about a kilometer.
According to the Medaian calculations, traffic in the park of Castle Hohenfels would increase tenfold.
We are talking about about 2000 vehicles a day.
The city has not yet expressed its support for the project.
Glandorf retires from the national handball team
Holger Glandorf will no longer play for the DHB team.
The 31-year-old Bundesliga player SG Flensburg-Handewitt was mainly concerned with health issues.
I didn't like the decision, it was made over several months.
It's time for me to listen to the signals of my body and end my career in the national team", the 2007 World Cup champion said on his Facebook page.
He is therefore retiring from international football with a record of 167 international caps and 576 goals for Germany.
Because the giant rear-winger from Flensburg wants to go on a road trip for a few more years, he is no longer available to the new German coach Dagur Sigurdsson.
Glandorf had a "long and good conversation" with the Icelandic, who announced his squad for the domestic games against Switzerland on Tuesday.
His ideas and approaches have fascinated me as much as they will my longtime teammates and followers.
But I want to be available for my club in the next few years, and that requires longer recovery breaks that do not allow the current double burden.
The left-hander had to fear the end of his career after a foot infection in 2012.
Because of Achilles' heel problems, he had been treated by team doctors of the German Handball Federation (DHB) with a cortisone injection, which later caused severe inflammation.
An emergency operation followed and two more interventions.
Then Glandorf had filed a lawsuit against the team doctor, and the dispute ended in a settlement.
Twelve years of professional and eleven years of national team career go by no body without a trace.
I have some health construction sites I can't ignore anymore.
After three infection-related foot surgeries in 2012 that took place at short intervals, I never really got my blood pressure under control.
This is accompanied by other wear-related complaints.
Already at the beginning of the year, I realized that while I can control my head, my body cannot deceive me", Glandorf told Handball Time magazine.
He'd be ready for a comeback only in an absolute emergency.
"When all the threads are torn, I am always conversational", the father of two told the magazine.
However, I can count the years I can still play handball with one hand.
I must also say that after my long stay in hospital in 2012, I have also become quite humble in terms of my health.
After my career, I wish I could at least walk a little straight.
In addition to the 2007 World Cup title and the 2014 Champions League, he won the EHF Cup in 2008 (HSG Nordhorn) and 2010 (TBV Lemgo).
In 2012, he also secured the European Cup of Cup winners with Flensburg.
The German economy shrank by 0.2% in the spring
The global crises have slowed the German economy in the second quarter.
The Gross Domestic Product decreased by 0.2% from April to the end of June 2014 compared to the previous quarter.
The Federal Statistical Office informed the Commission and confirmed preliminary calculations.
Consumption alone sustained the economy in the spring, while investment declined.
Foreign trade also slowed the economy.
The strong annual start-up resulted in a GDP growth of 0.8% in the first half of the year compared to the second half of 2013.
Horstmar was the starting point and the destination of the "Münsterland-Mooiste", which led through the town of Burgmann for the first time on Sunday.
The town of Horstmar was invaded by Dutch "fietcher" on Sunday.
The largest cycling association in the Netherlands, NTFU, organised the so-called "Münsterland-Mooiste".
This is the largest cycling tour of the Münsterland, a cyclist's paradise near the Netherlands.
Over 1000 participants thanked Jos ter Huerne for organising this tour of the Münsterland.
Published in various trade journals, this tour was offered to interested persons.
We're from Den Helder and we drove overnight to take part in this tour.
We would like to get to know Münsterland better in this way too", the cyclists were happy to see the route through the districts of Steinfurt, Borken and Coesfeld.
After registering at the Shooter's Home in Sta.
Catherine took a small "peace trip" through the city, over the Wall, where the start was also made.
The route, which was written for three different categories, continued towards Herrenholz over the Schöppinger mountain towards Coesfeld and back to Horstmar via Havixbeck and Billerbeck.
On 95 kilometres (1,175 feet), 120 kilometres (1,475 feet) and 145 kilometres (1,775 feet) of track, the cyclists proved themselves in good condition.
They were taken care of on the way to Havixbeck and Billerbeck.
The main organiser, Jos ter Huerne, and deputy mayor Heinz Lölfing, were very pleased with the success of this cycling event.
We are satisfied and it was a good experience for everyone involved.
The organisation went smoothly and there were no negative incidents", Heinz Lölfing concludes.
Unfortunately, not as many participants came as the organiser had hoped, probably because of the bad weather forecast and the morning rain.
"We hope to see you again in 2015 with good weather on 30 August or during another weekend", the cyclists promised to return to Münsterland and the organisers plan a new edition.
The mercilessly honest memoirs of Konstantin Wecker
It's actually more of a philosophical testimony than a biography, which Konstantin Wecker, songwriter, pacifist, political activist, ex-convict, has brought to paper in "Monkey and Warrior" at 287 pages.
Not chronologically, but more thought-for-thought-for-thought-for-thought, Municher, born on June 1, 1947, wrote his memoirs, each chapter beginning with a suitable lyrical text.
And he's ruthlessly honest: From high school sweetheart to shoplifting and drug use, he doesn't leave out human weakness.
Also to show how he himself learned tolerance in dealing with his fellow man.
He also takes up abstract but all the more important concepts: love, soul, ego, being in the present, spirituality - all of which he tries to get to the bottom of, in a very philosophical but also very personal way.
He also explains his pacifism, his social criticism, his political commitment - and how not only music (who became an opera lover and soul and rock musician) but also his prison sentence influenced him.
The latter also brought the living man Konstantin Wecker closer to the ascetic monk, who "is formed by subtraction", as he says, "by leaving out everything unnecessary".
But among all the high-minded views, there are also brief anecdotes about the earth: like a fight in a local that GI frequents or a crazy drive where he's head-on aiming at a tree.
He's being mercilessly honest again.
My father never took me in his arms.
Never said "I love you"
Henry was one of seven children born to a Jamaican immigrant family in Dudley, Midlands in 1958.
His father, who died when Henry was 19, worked in a factory and their relationship was limited.
Henry is auditioning for a comedy, Rudy's Rare Records, which is based in part on an imaginary conversation with his father and was created from the Radio 4 series.
The soundtrack is a mix of reggae and rap, with vibrant melodies.
But Henry had to work through some difficult childhood moments.
He attended "many" therapies after his mother died, and Henry is thoughtful about his relationship with his father.
It was hard to know him.
You never saw his face, you only heard his voice, "Stop the screaming.
Leave your sister alone.
Move it! Move it!
I want to watch cricket.
My older brothers Seymour and Hilton - who had grown up when I was a child - went to the bar with him and talked about things like the shape of a beer glass or the beauty of a cricket bat.
I never had a conversation like this with him.
For most of my life, he was this serious guy in the corner reading the paper.
Recently Henry opened a foundry in Dudley, and although the conditions are better than in his father's day, he gained insight into what life might have been like for him.
It's a little lighter now, but they're dark, smoky, deeply stylized labyrinths with flames and smoke and a lot of rust.
My father used to just lie in the tub and then you could hear him singing slowly because he could wash the foundry off.
As I walked around, I realized that he had been doing this for years to get the food on the table, and my respect for him grew.
Yet, as a child, Henry grew up without any love from his parents.
My father never hugged me, never said "I love you".
It wasn't until my mother was sick at the end of her life that we started saying, "I love you, I love you, I love you".
Through his own daughter Billie, with Dawn French, he was able to share the love he had missed as a child.
Would you stop saying "I love you"?
Stop hugging me!
Dad, I'm 22 years old!
I'm with Dawn French.
Why shouldn't we be friends?
She's a great mother.
He's still friends with French, who he's been married to for 25 years.
Dawn is a good person.
Why shouldn't we be friends?
She's a great mother.
Henry's own mother was a diabetic.
That contributed to her death.
So when I got very, very overweight and showed symptoms of diabetes, my doctor said, "You must be radical.
So I went through this fitness thing and I also had to go on a drastic diet to reverse the symptoms.
It's very difficult.
And it's exhausting.
Nobody likes to eat carrots.
Henry's career change may be reflected in his elegant, short-cut beard.
Since he was praised by the critics for his Othello, he has been taken in by the theatre.
It was followed by The Comedy of Errors, and then Fences by August Wilson.
It's a different experience than the sitcoms and comedies that filled his busy working life.
He started when he was only 16 years old, working in a factory.
A DJ discovered him on stage imitating people and writing about him to New Faces.
His television career began in the mid-1970s. "I was the only black impersonator/comedian on television for quite a long time".
He learned in the trade.
I had to not only grow up in front of the public, but from 1975 to 1985, I had to learn how to become an efficient joke-telling machine while I was a star through television, and that was really hard.
Lenny in 1975 at New Faces
Since his manager owned the stage rights to the Black and White Minstrel Show, a light entertainment program where people "painted black", Henry performed his comedy there for five years.
My family was very uncomfortable.
I wish it had never happened, but I don't regret doing it.
It was a strange, uncomfortable position for me, but I worked on huge projects and learned how to deal with a large audience.
But this "year-long award-winning lightweight pillar of British television" was also a "grotesque parody of black people".
By introducing characters who both mocked and celebrated British black culture, Henry worked on an alternative comedy circle in the 1980s.
The first series of The Lenny Henry Show aired in 1984, and in the 1990s he was known as the chef Gareth Blacklock on the comedy series Chef!.
Advertising, documentaries, TV shows and film roles shaped his next decade, but after his 2008 BBC series LennyHenry.tv, he thought, "What are you doing next, Len, because it all feels like you're just wasting time or stepping a little bit on the spot".
Then came a documentary series for Radio 4 called What's So Great About...?
The first episode was about Shakespeare.
I was really allergic to Shakespeare.
I never really learned anything about him in school and I thought he was mostly a middle-class domain, white in trousers and a cabbage head in the front.
So I was really scared of it.
Everyone we interviewed for the show, Peter Hall, Trevor Nunn, Adrian Lester, Judi Dench, said, "You should try it.
Don't be so mean if you don't know what you're talking about.
Put a few words in your mouth, and you'll understand why we all love Shakespeare so much.
Henry performed 20 lines of Othello's last speech for the documentary and he was thrilled.
I felt like I could do it.
It was almost like someone finally put my head right on me.
"So it goes, it's a serious thing, take it seriously, learn your text, do some research.
The rehearsals were brutal, and I read this piece for months before we did.
And it was a success.
They seemed to expect a car accident, and it just didn't happen.
And soon he was in the comedy of errors.
Suddenly I was at the National Theatre and I couldn't believe it.
There was a moment when I thought, "Oh, you've changed".
There was a technical flaw, and Henry instinctively felt the need to entertain the audience.
"A little voice told me, 'You have to cross the bridge for 10 minutes now while they fix the computer.'"
Instead, the stage manager announced that the show would continue once the problem was resolved.
I walked off the stage and something inside me said, "Oh, thank God".
I'm not responsible for that.
I can leave this to someone else.
"You're in a play, so stay in your role".
Henry in Fences at the Duchess Theatre
Learning the lyrics for Fences was challenging.
Panic is very good, it strengthens the tendons.
That too was good, so it's like a big shield of the gods telling me, "This is your destiny".
He says this, of course, in a low voice.
So I'm staying with it.
I really love this.
I love being in a rehearsal room.
But Henry still has the head of a comedian -- our conversation is full of humorous outbursts while he repeatedly imitates people.
I decided not to do stand-up comedy because I find that this kind of instant gratification from a room full of strangers is somewhat dangerous.
If you keep looking for that, you're going to hit a wall.
I sometimes perform live at the Apollo when I feel like it, but overall, I don't get as much as I used to.
I ask him if he's ever gonna do a stand-up comedy tour again.
The fun I have in a room with a director who helps shape the beginning, middle and end of a journey, I don't think I'll ever want to give it up again.
So this is his new incarnation?
I think I have.
I like being an actor.
It's fun.
You always tell a story, and that's great.
I love stories.
People love stories.
Houthi rebels block roads in Yemen's capital
In the conflict between Shiite Houthi rebels and the Yemeni government, the Houthis have called for civil disobedience in the capital Sanaa.
Houthi supporters occupied central streets in Sanaa on Monday, a spokesman for the Houthi party Ansar Allah said.
The access to Parliament was also blocked.
Yemeni media reports of a traffic jam in the capital.
According to the online edition of the Yemen Post, Houthi leader Abdulmalik al-Huthi called for action on Sunday evening.
According to the paper, Huthi threatened to escalate the conflict further if his demands were not met.
The Shiite Houthis are fighting for greater independence from Sunni-ruled Yemen and demanding the resignation of the government.
The Houthi people have been besieging the Yemeni capital for almost two weeks.
Some 30,000 rebels have set up protest camps on the main roads of Sanaa.
There are bloody battles with the Yemeni army around the country.
Kenya registers officials to contain "ghost employees"
Kenya has begun biometrically registering all government officials to remove "spirit employees" from government payroll.
Employees who do not register for the next two weeks will not be paid, according to a government statement.
The government suspects that thousands of people still receive salaries after they leave the public service.
President Uhuru Kenyatta, when he took office in 2013, promised to fight corruption in the public service.
An audit earlier this year found that at least $1 million (£700,000) a month was lost on payments to "spiritual employees" and other financial misconduct.
The government suspects that salaries will continue to be paid into accounts after a person dies or leaves the public service, Wanyama Chebusiri reports to the BBC from the capital Nairobi.
All officials must now appear at identification centres within the next two weeks to ensure their data is recorded via biometric records, a government message said.
The Commission has also been asked to take a decision on the implementation of the programme.
"This will significantly contribute to the streamlining of the public service by identifying the actual number of civil servants and adjusting the payroll at both levels of government - eliminating 'spiritual employees,'" said Anne Waiguru, Cabinet Secretary at the Ministry of Decentralization and Planning.
The scandal surrounding art consultant Helge Achenbach will be heard in court for the first time on November 11.
Five heirs of Berthold Albrecht, son of Aldi founder Theo Albrecht, are seeking €19.4 million in damages from Achenbach and two of its companies in insolvency proceedings in a civil case before the Landgericht Düsseldorf.
A court spokeswoman said that on Monday.
The complaint states that Achenbach cheated on the purchase of works of art and antiques and that Berthold Albrecht charged higher prices than the actual purchase price.
This also increased the agreed commission.
Achenbach has bought valuables for Albrecht for 121 million euros.
Children need roots and wings
He was in school for 44 years, 23 of them as a school principal.
Manfred Richter knew many of the professed Petershausers and Kollbacher from their time as students.
His methods were sometimes unconventional, but always driven by his desire to see the human being in the student.
The Snow Head is the most famous mountain on the Giant Mountain.
Manfred Richter loves painting with the motif from his hometown.
Richter was born in 1930 in Trautenau, North Bohemia, now Trutnov.
At the age of 14, he became interested in teaching after four years of college.
A year later, the Sudeten Germans were expropriated.
Within half an hour, the family had to leave their home.
After a few months in a camp, in 1946 they went to Bavaria - in a freight car.
So the judge took it to the village of Senkend in Upper France.
Teacher training took place in Bamberg.
Manfred Richter had to walk six times a week ten miles to the nearest train station, take the train to Bamberg, walk three miles across the city to school, and then return in the evening.
After two months, Manfred Richter was given a place to sleep in a Red Cross home in Bamberg, along with up to 15 of his classmates in a bedroom.
In 1951 he took the first and in 1954 after three years as a teacher's examiner, the second.
Since Oberfranken had no teaching position available for him, he applied to Oberbayern and arrived at the school in Kollbach on 1 November 1954.
The "girlfriend's room" was his first "service call" in the schoolhouse.
In 1958, he bought a three-room service station in the newly built teacher's house next to the school.
This house was bought by Manfred Richter in 1980, after the school in Kollbach was dissolved in 1968.
Up until then there were three classes in the Petershausen-Kollbach school association and five in Petershausen.
From the school year 1968/69 they were consolidated in Petershausen in the current Town Hall.
When the school association Indersdorf was founded, only the primary school remained in the village.
To avoid a re-education in the now smaller school, then-rector Georg Sigl moved to Karlsfeld - and Manfred Richter became his successor.
However, Petershausen grew and from September 1982 onwards the children and their teachers were able to purchase the current building, which was extended in 1997 after Richter's retirement.
Manfred Richter commends the uncomplicated generosity of the then mayor Ludwig Götz, who added a workspace at the expense of the municipality and the basement at the expansion in 1997, although this was not eligible under the school building guidelines.
"Citizen Mayor Götz was very school-friendly", the judge thankfully recalled.
Throughout his career, Manfred Richter never forgot the speech of a government official who had answered a school board lecture on law and justice: "You must never forget love". Manfred Richter put into practice what he had heard as a young teacher.
"You have to give the children two things: roots and wings", says the now 84-year-old.
And he had to learn, "It doesn't always work". Whether he's just talking about his students or his own six children, it's not clear.
In any case, Judge's actions were sometimes unconventional.
When students fought, he did not punish them or force them to sit.
At the expense of the community, the judge had bought two pairs of boxing gloves and had the two counterparts compete against each other, even if there was a veil to it.
For the sake of the school, Judge maintained a good relationship with the then mayor Ludwig Götz (CSU) as rector.
This moved the nonpartisan judge to run for the municipal council in 1996, at least last on the CSU list.
But Judge was elected to the 6th place and joined the CSU.
180 kilometers in three days
HR4 RADTOUR 700 cyclists stop at the spa in Bad Salzhausen and Scots
When cyclists take a break on their tour in Bath Salzhausen or Scotland, it's nothing special.
On Friday, however, the number of people who were resting alone impressed: the 700 participants of the hr4 cycling tour and the accompanying trousers enjoyed a break in the lower spa park of Bad Salzhausen and later a party in the open air in the Alteburg park in Scotland.
Under the motto "Riding and celebrating on newly discovered roads between Nidda and Kinzig", the participants met in Bad Vilbel on Thursday and witnessed a concert by Van Baker & Band.
On Friday, the cyclists took the first step, racing 60 kilometres over Florstadt to Bad Salzhausen and then on to Scots.
In Bad Salzhausen, the athletes were welcomed by Mayor Hans-Peter Seum, who had started cycling in Bad Vilbel, and the head of Bad Salzhausen's own company, Petra Schwing-Döring.
For refreshment of body and mind, all sorts of good things had been prepared: The rural women of Ranstadt and Nieder-Mockstadt had baked 85 sheets of apple, twisted, streusel and cheese cakes, which were wonderful for the skilled cyclists.
"Such cakes can only be baked by peasant women", praised one participant from Aulendiebach, while ordering another piece.
Cold refreshments were obtained at the drink stand of the Gois-Nidda club.
The "Bravo Duo" entertained the visitors with well-known melodies from operettas and musicals and received enthusiastic applause.
The beautiful atmosphere of the park seemed relaxing.
One man also enjoyed a head massage from his partner: "He deserved it, after all, today he has reattached broken bicycle chains".
Meanwhile, the mayor and the manager had to work: they were interviewed by reporter Rainer Janke at the well outside the drinking house and used the opportunity to advertise on the radio for Bad Salzhausen.
The first tour of the hr4 cycle in 2004 was also short-lived, as the head of promotion, Tobias Hagen, was also involved in the local technology.
His pickup truck, where he communicated with his staff and the 15-man motorcycle squad of the Hessen police using three phones and a radio, wrote Facebook posts and made reports, also needed a check.
"Most of the participants are from the Rhine-Main region", he said, "but cyclists have also come from Gießen or Fulda, Lauterbach or Taunus and even from many cities in Westphalia.
The number of participants is based on the available accommodation capacity.
In category I, participants are accommodated in hotels, in category II, in collective accommodation.
The cyclists had a good impression of the spa when they left again after an hour and a half.
"It was nice in Bath Salzhausen!" they waved.
After arriving in Scotland, the group was allowed to take a short break.
But in the evening, the bikers were called in to the idyllic Alteburg Park.
Under the direction of the Scottish Society for Tourism and Urban Marketing (GTS), the park had been given a nice festive atmosphere and, of course, candy, such as flame cakes with well-cooled feather whites, had been prepared.
Mayor Susanne Schaab, GTS Managing Director Markus Hoßfeld and MSC Chairman Wolfgang Wagner-Sachs, in their capacity as a member of the ADAC Hessen-Thüringen Executive Board, welcomed the visitors.
The three were visibly pleased with the "many operations in Scotland".
DJ Tobias Hagen then released the dance scene.
The opportunity to move around in the open air was eagerly used despite the sporting activity on the bike.
The guests were increasingly joined by citizens who were as excited as the large crowd of cyclists.
On the second day, the stations Birstein, Wächtersbach and Bad Orb - including a concert with the trenkwalds - were on the programme for the cyclists.
Yesterday, after 180 kilometers of cycling, the athletes entered Bad Vilbel again.
Dozens of Turkish police officers arrested for "conspiracy" against the government
A total of 33 police officers were arrested in Turkey on suspicion of "conspiracy against the government", local media reports.
The police did not immediately comment.
Among those arrested are 14 high-ranking police officers, reports Hürriyet Daily News.
Some of them were involved in corruption investigations against government officials, including four government ministers last December.
In July, a number of Turkish police officers were arrested for allegedly setting up an organized criminal association and tampering with phone numbers.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan (then prime minister) described their actions as part of activities led by Islamist cleric Fethulla Güllen against him and other people in positions of power.
Not all children in Ukraine go back to school
Schools in almost all parts of Ukraine opened on Monday after the summer holidays.
This day is traditionally an important day for families, and like thousands of other Ukrainian parents, Prime Minister Arseniy Jazenjuk brought his daughter to school.
There he told waiting journalists that not all schools had reopened, but that he was determined to defend the country for future generations:
The September celebrations were not held in every school.
The sky is not peaceful all over Ukraine.
We must fight for a peaceful heaven.
The whole of Ukraine, a huge, common Ukrainian people's front must fight for a peaceful heaven.
Aleksan Pastukhow, headmaster of the school in Slavjansk, who visits Jazenjuk's daughter, spoke Russian.
We hope that peace will finally reign here and that the children will receive an education that will be useful to them in their later lives.
The first day of the new school year is traditionally celebrated by children wearing embroidered shirts, holding balloons and giving flowers to their teachers.
With Rona Fairhead, the BBC may have found the great director it needs.
She's a proud celebrity who's been to the banking world, the media and the inner circle of the Tory party.
And she has her own experience on the front lines.
She began her career at global management consulting firm Bain and Co., where she moved to Morgan Stanley, Bombadier, ICI and the media world of Pearson.
She was CEO of the Financial Times for seven years, and stepped down when the top position at Pearson's parent company went to a younger male colleague.
Her compensation was said to be almost £1 million.
Their political ranking is also solid.
She was recommended by David Cameron by Lord Browne, the former chairman of BP, when he was looking for more private sector knowledge in Whitehall: she became a cabinet adviser.
Her husband is a former Tory councillor.
I already described the chairman's task in May with a poisoned chalice.
Not only is the BBC a huge and complex entity at the heart of public life, but there is also an internal paradox in its structure.
Trust works in two directions: inside the first guard of the BBC's own management hierarchy, but also outside as a voice of public concern and unrest when things go wrong.
This creates an almost unsustainable duopoly that demands complete and comprehensive reform.
But what newly-arrived chairman would risk going up, attacking everything and dismantling an institution as complex as a Chinese dynasty, while perhaps taking his own job.
It's a difficult task.
And if that's not enough, many are still interested in seeing the BBC downsized - power, money and status outnumbered.
As competition grows closer and new technologies threaten old, comfortable securities, the upcoming negotiation of BBC licence fees is associated with particular dangers.
For the modest sum of £145.50 a year, the British public is buying into the world's certainly largest media company.
The BBC tells a good story: it says it reaches 96 percent of all households, and each of them costs only 40 pence a day.
And apparently, the BBC is back up the popularity ladder: 53 percent support it today, compared to 31 percent 10 years ago.
The viewing and usage habits for the BBC have changed: I get headlines on my phone these days and watch missed programs later on my iPlayer.
But it remains a very beloved and remarkable institution.
She needs a great chairman - I hope she found him.
Perry from Texas says the downloadable tweet was not authorized
A tweet from the official user account of Texas Republican Governor Rick Perry on Sunday included a demeaning comment about the Democratic District Attorney who is the focus of a criminal prosecution against him for abuse of office.
The tweet was later deleted and replaced by another user account from Perry, which denies the previous one.
There was a tweet just sent from my account that I didn't authorize.
"I disapprove of the tweet and deleted it", the message said later.
Perry's staff did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Although the tweets came from Perry's official user account, it was unclear who actually served the feed.
The previous tweet showed an unfavorable picture of Travis County District Attorney Rosemary Lehmberg, who was convicted of drunk driving in April 2013.
Perry vetoed a financial subsidy from her office when she refused to resign, which led to a lawsuit against Perry - who could be a 2016 presidential candidate - before a grand jury this month in Austin.
The text of the tweet reads: "I don't always drive drunk with the triple alcohol level... but when I do, I sue Governor Perry when he gossipes".
I'm the most drunk Democrat in Texas.
Lehmberg's office wasn't tasked with leading the Grand Jury's investigation into Perry.
It was led by Michael McCrum, a special counsel from San Antonio, who was chosen by a Republican judge.
Perry pleaded not guilty and called the charge a political ploy.
His high-ranking team of attorneys asked the judge in charge of the case to dismiss the charges, arguing that the law that would be passed against the oldest serving governor in Texas history was unconstitutionally diffuse.
Perry stopped $7.5 million in state funds from the state's Public Integrity Unit - which is based in Travis County and is investigating state corruption cases in Texas - when Lehmberg refused to resign.
This veto caused a public appeal by a left-wing watchdog group.
Perry's official user account is updated frequently - and sometimes famous.
After finishing fifth in the 2012 Iowa general election, Perry speculated that he would stop by posting a tweet of a photo of himself jogging near a lake, with the words "South Carolina, we're coming!"
Berkeley declares housing market "normal" again
One of London's most prominent contractors pointed out that the housing market in south-east England had 'returned' to normal.
The capital's homes were in high demand and subject to huge price increases, which prompted the Bank of England to set up mortgage caps in June due to widespread fears of a credit bubble.
Tony Pidgley, founder and CEO of the high-end construction company Berkeley, said on Monday: "Since the start of the current financial year, the market has returned to normal transaction levels since peaking in 2013", adding that this provides a 'stable environment for action'.
The London real estate market was well positioned during the downturn as foreign buyers rushed into the capital.
According to the Census Bureau, prices in urban areas have risen by 18.5% in the past year alone, far more than the average increase in England and Wales as a whole.
Average selling prices for Berkeley's private, low-cost and student offerings rose by about a fifth last year to around £423,000 at the end of April.
However, a stronger pound has made London property less attractive to foreign buyers in recent months - some of whom have also been deterred by the introduction of new property taxes and political rhetoric about a possible "village tax" ahead of the general election in May.
London real estate broker Foxtons warned last week that the April mortgage market report, which introduced tighter lending arrangements, would also lead to lower market growth in both property sales and prices in the second half of the year.
New data from the Bank of England on Monday shows a decline in mortgage authorization in July, which also indicates that the real estate market is cooling down.
Hamptions International, another real estate agency, has adjusted its prediction for 2015 London property prices to fall to 3 percent, based on a already weakening house price consciousness.
The volume of transactions in London's most expensive areas, such as Chelsea, Mayfair and Kensington, has now fallen by a quarter year on year, according to broker WA Ellis.
Nevertheless, the desire for a home in the capital is a boon for Berkeley, as the sums due for the sale of dates amount to more than £2.2 billion.
Mr Pidgley added: "Demand for the right, well-planned product at the best locations has remained stable and as a result, sales on time have remained stable".
In June, the company reported that it had sold 3,742 new homes in the year to the end of April - almost a third more than at its pre-crisis peak in 2007.
Annual pre-tax income increased by 40 per cent to £280 million, and turnover by 18 per cent to £1.6 billion.
In a statement issued on Monday ahead of the company's annual meeting, Mr Pidgley said that revenues for Berkeley this year are expected to match current market expectations.
Analysts have unanimously estimated the annual pre-tax profit at £450 million.
Berkeley shares stood at £23.96 in the London stock market this afternoon.
Nude photos of Jennifer Lawrence posted by hackers on the Internet
Jennifer Lawrence is performing at the 85th Academy Awards.
Naked photos of Oscar winner Jennifer Lawrence were posted online by a hacker who claimed to have a "master list" of images of 100 other starlets.
A representative of the star from The Tribute of Panem confirmed that the photos of Lawrence were real and accused the hacker of "outright privacy violations".
The authorities have been notified and will be pursuing anyone who posts the stolen photos of Jennifer Lawrence.
The photos, originally posted on the photo-sharing site 4chan, were allegedly acquired by a gap in Apple's online storage system iCloud.The alleged "master list" of the hacking victims includes the names of dozens of female stars, including Rihanna, Kim Kardashian, Mary Elizabeth Winstead and Mary-Kate Olsen, BuzzFeed reported.
It's not clear how many of the images are real, although Winstead, star of "Scott Pilgrim Against the Rest of the World", also condemned the hack on Twitter.
"To those of you who are looking at photos that my husband and I took years ago in private in our home - I hope you are so happy with yourself", Winstead wrote on Twitter.
However, Victoria Justice of Nickelodeon series "iCarly" and "Victorious" denied that the photos were about pictures of her, tweeting, "These so-called nude pictures of me are FAVORITE, people.
Let's start with the beginning.
Buzzfeed reported late Sunday that a spokesman for pop star Ariana Grande denied the authenticity of the alleged photos of her.
Exclusive excerpt from Howard Jacobson's highly acclaimed new novel about love and the letter "J".
They dissolved, as best described, slowly as a carton left standing in the rain.
Occasionally, a woman told him that he was too serious, exhausting, intense, distant, and perhaps a little scratchy.
And then shake his hand.
He knew it.
It was spiny, like a hedgehog, yeah.
The last victim of this stinginess was a newly begun affair that had been more promising for relief from the lonely boredom of his life than usual, and perhaps even brought him some satisfaction.
Ailinn Solomons was a trembling delicate beauty with untamed hair and a flattering heart from a village on the North Island, which was even more remote and rough than Port Reuben.
She had come south with an older companion who thought Kevern was her aunt, and who had inherited a plot of land in a moist but paradise valley with the apt name Paradise Valley.
For several years no one had lived in the house.
The pipes were leaking, there were spiders in the bathrooms, naked snails had left their mark on all the windows, thinking they owned it all, and the garden was filled with weeds that looked like giant cabbage heads.
It was like the house in a children's fairy tale, both threatening and tempting, a garden full of secrets.
Portrait of the author: Howard Jacobson, whose novel "J" is on the longlist for the 2014 Man Booker Prize.
The shortlist will be announced next week.
Kevern and Ailinn had sat with their hands on the broken chairs in the high grass, enjoying an unusually warm spring afternoon, and both had been mindlessly lurking into the service console, which provided the country with soothing music and soothing news, when the sight of their crossed brown legs reminded him of an old song of a long-forgotten black entertainer whose father had enjoyed listening to at closed aisles in the house.
Your feet are too big.
Because of their inherent aggression, songs of this kind were no longer played on the console.
Nothing was really forbidden, just not played.
It was successfully obsolete, just like obsolete the word.
General taste did what decrees and regulations never did, and just as people in books choose the dishwasher-to-millionaire memoirs, cookbooks, and love novels, they chose ballads in music.
In the euphoria of the day, Kevern began to play an imaginary piano and sing Ailynn's big feet in a grumpy-comic serenade.
Ailinn didn't understand that.
"It was a well-known song by a jazz pianist named Fats Waller", he explained, automatically putting two fingers on his lips.
His father used to do that to stop the letter J before it came out of his mouth.
It started as a game between him and his father when he was a kid.
His father had played it with his own father, he told me.
If you start a word with a J without putting two fingers over your lips, it costs you a penny.
It wasn't a very funny game back then, and it wasn't very funny now.
He knew this was expected of him, that's all.
It had to explain what jazz was.
Ailinn had never heard of one.
Jazz was not played, even if it wasn't directly prohibited.
Improvisation was not modern anymore.
It was just a place for a single "if" in life.
People wanted to be sure at the beginning of a song where it would end.
So is the mind.
His unpredictability made people nervous.
And jazz was a musical expression of mind.
Although he had turned 10 years old without hearing of Sammy Davis Jr., Kevern knew something about jazz from his father's semi-secret collection of old CDs.
But at least he didn't have to explain to Ailinn that Fats Waller was black.
At her age, she probably couldn't remember a time when pop singers weren't black.
Again, no laws or coercion.
A conformist society meant that every element of that society agreed to the principle of group talent, thanks to those spared from destiny.
People of African-Caribbean descent were fit for entertainment and sport because of their temperament and bodybuilding, so they sang and ran.
People originally from the Indian subcontinent were blessed by nature with electronic talent and were tasked with ensuring that no family was left without a functioning utility phone.
What was left of the Polish community was taken care of the sewerage; what was left of the Greeks was cutting up plates.
Those from the Gulf and Levant whose grandparents had not left the country as quickly as they had, when they had - out of fear of being charged with arson, even out of fear that the flames would consume them next - had opened labneh and shisha pipe restaurants, kept their heads up, and became depressed by inactivity.
Each according to his ability.
Since she had only heard ballads, Ailinn found it difficult to understand how the offensive words that Kevern had just sung to her could ever be interpreted.
Music was an expression of love.
"They're not really offensive", Kevern said.
Except maybe for people whose feet are too big.
My father never insulted anyone, but he loved that song.
He talked too much, but the neglected garden gave him the deceptive sense of security.
Nothing could beat the soundproofing of the huge, cohesive leaves.
Ailinn still didn't understand.
Why would your father love something like that?
He wanted to say it was a joke, but hesitated to put two fingers on her lips again in her presence.
She thought he was weird anyway.
"It seemed funny to him", he said instead.
She shook her head unbelievingly and blocked Kevern's vision.
There was nothing else to see in the whole world but her uncompressed black rabbi hair.
There was nothing else he wanted to see.
"When you say it", she says without conviction.
But that doesn't explain why you're singing it to me.
She seemed genuinely concerned.
Are my feet too big?
He looked again.
Your feet aren't that straight.
Maybe your ankle, a little bit...
And you say you hate me because my ankles are too thick?
Hate you?
Of course I don't hate you.
It's just the stupid song.
He could have said "I love you", but it was too early for that.
"Your thick ankles are exactly why I like you", he tried instead.
I'm a little perverted.
That didn't sound right.
It was supposed to be funny.
When he tried to be funny, he often got into trouble because, like his father, he did not have the calming charm needed to contain the cruelty inherent in jokes.
Maybe his father wanted to be cruel too.
Maybe he wanted to be, Kevern.
Despite his friendly eyes.
Ailinn Solomons turned red and got out of her bed, threw the console over and spilled the wine they had been drinking.
Holunderflower wine, so drunkenness was no excuse for him.
In her excitement, she seemed to tremble like a palm tree in a storm.
"And your thick head is exactly why I'm pervertedly attracted to you", she said...
Except I'm not.
She felt sorry for him, both for the unnecessary cruelty of his words and for the fear that she felt in her eyes when she rebelled against him.
Did she think he was gonna beat her?
She hadn't told him about life on the cold northern archipelago where she grew up, but he had no doubt that it was essentially like this.
The same huge, icy ocean broke here as it did on the shore.
The same confused men, with even thicker skin and more disgusting than their ancestors had been as smugglers and beach robbers, moved from bar to bar, always ready to raise their hand against a woman who refused or laughed at them.
- You're a fathead?
They would have given her a big fist if she hadn't been careful!
They first clap -- clap was the most commonly used word for erotic attraction between men and women, an antidote to the trivial love ballads from the console -- they clap and then beat.
In Kever's view, this was an unnecessary refinement, since the clutching itself was already an act of violence.
Ailinn Solomons gave him a sign to walk through her body.
He got out of his couch like an old man.
She felt as if she was grief-stricken, but the intensity of his grief surprised her.
It wasn't the end of the world.
They hardly knew each other.
She watched him walk away - as her companion watched him from a room upstairs - a man complaining about something he had provoked.
Adam's leaving the garden, she thought.
She felt a sudden pain for him and men in general, although some had raised their hands against her.
A man turned away from her, bowing his back, ashamed, defeated, without fighting spirit - why was that a sight she seemed to know well, when she could not remember a single time she had seen anything like this before today?
When she was alone again, Ailinn looked at Solomons' feet.
Several years before the events just described, Esme Nussbaum, an intelligent and enthusiastic 32-year-old researcher on behalf of Ofnow, the non-legislative watchdog for public opinion, gave a brief lecture on continued violence at low and medium levels in the very parts of the country where it would have been most likely to be reduced, if not eliminated, given the money and energy invested in eradicating that violence.
"Much has been done, and much remains to be done", she wrote, "to appease the innate aggression of a people who have fought a thousand wars and won most of them, especially in the remote corners and valleys of the country, where the sweet breath of human kindness has historically been rarely felt despite the high-rise church towers between the fences.
But some traits prove to be inexhaustible.
The higher the church tower, it seems, the less passion it continues to arouse.
The population wept at the sound of sentimental ballads, became drunk on stories of overcome difficulties, and claimed to believe firmly in the virtues of marriage and family life, but yet not only did the former cruelty hold the rural communities and our urban fabric in their hands, but there was also evidence of the emergence of a new and insidious spirit of quarrel at home, at work, on the streets and even on the playgrounds.
"You have an unfortunate tendency to exaggerate", her mentor said after reading the entire report.
I suggest you read fewer novels.
Esme nut tree lowered her head.
I must also ask, are you an atheist?
"I don't think I have to say that", said Esme Nussbaum.
Are you a lesbian?
Esme again invoked her right to privacy and denial of testimony.
What, a feminist?
Shut up again.
"I don't ask that", Luther Rabinowitz finally said, "because I would be against atheism, lesbianism or feminism.
This is a workplace free of prejudice.
We serve a society free of prejudice.
But certain types of hypersensitivity, which are in themselves absolutely acceptable and commendable, can sometimes distort the results you've imagined.
You yourself obviously have prejudices against the church, and what you call "subversive" and "raw" could be interpreted by others as an expression of natural strength and vitality.
If you continue to go around what is, if it is, as if it had happened yesterday, it means taking away the country's essential life force.
Esme Nussbaum looked around while Rabinowitz spoke.
Behind his head, a LED inscription in Flamingorosa repeated the advice Ofnow had given the country over the past quarter century or so.
Smile at your neighbor, appreciate your partner, listen to ballads, attend musicals, use your phone, talk, explain, listen, agree, apologize.
Speaking is better than silence, the word sung is better than the written, but nothing is better than love.
"I absolutely understand what you mean", answered Esme Nussbaum in a calm voice, as she was sure that her boss had finished speaking, "and I say nothing else but that we are not yet as effective in curing ourselves as we imagine.
My concern is that we may find ourselves, without warning, repeating the mistakes that led to WHAT IS WHEN IS.
But this time, it's not the others we're letting go of our anger and our distrust.
Luther Rabinowitz designed a pyramid with his hands.
To suggest an angel's patience.
"You go too far", he said, "if you call actions 'mistakes' that our grandparents may or may not have committed.
You're also going too far when you talk about them leaving their "anger" and their "suspicion" to "others".
It shouldn't be necessary to remind someone in your position that when we understand the past and protect the present, we're not talking about "us" and "others".
There was no "we" and there was no "others".
It was a time of disorder, that's all we know.
"From the fact that we are honest with ourselves", Esme dared to point out, "no part of society can claim to have behaved well.
I'm not accusing anyone.
Whether it was done badly or well, what happened happened.
That was then.
We have to say nothing more - we agree on that.
And just as no debt needs to be assigned, no debt needs to be cancelled if such a redemption is appropriate and if there is a way to do so.
But what is the use of the past if we don't learn from it?
The past is meant to be forgotten.
If I may say anything about that...
Luther Rabinowitz had his pyramids collapsed.
"I will consider your report", he said and dismissed her.
The next day, as she was about to go to work, she was hit by a motorcyclist who, as passersby describe, was driving on the road in a kind of "brutal rage".
There are coincidences.
Lesotho military says no coup is planned; Prime Minister stays in South Africa
Officials of the military in Lesotho denied planning a coup to overthrow the government, saying they were targeting police officers accused of arming political fanatics.
Prime Minister Thomas Thabane fled the country and announced that the country's army had surrounded his official residence and occupied government buildings in the capital Maseru.
The prime minister brought his family to neighboring South Africa after reporting on assassination threats.
Military spokesman Major Ntlele Ntoi said there was no coup de facto, but that the military was responding to the threat of "political fanatics" armed by the police.
"What happened this morning was that the Lesotho Defence Force Staff acted after receiving several intelligence reports that some elements within the police were actually trying to arm some of the political, partisan young fanatics who were about to do devastating damage", he told Voice of America.
South African government spokesman Clayson Monyela said the military action had given the impression of a coup.
"Although no one has claimed to have overthrown the government by force, all reports agree that the activities of Lesotho's defence forces so far show signs of a coup", he said.
Lesotho's military said on Sunday that the soldiers were retreating to their barracks and the situation in the capital was calm.
Meanwhile, Deputy Prime Minister Mothetjoya Metsing will take over the government during Thabanes absence.
Thabane said he believes he was targeted for his attempt to fight corruption in the country.
There has been a lot of tension in Lesotho since June after Thabane suspended parliamentary sessions due to the conflicts in his unitary government.
He said his actions had not undermined the government, despite otherwise-sounding accusations.
Production in the euro area at a 13-month low
The growth in euro area production slowed in August to its lowest point in the past 13 months, according to a closely watched study.
The final Markit purchasing manager index for manufacturing (PMI) fell to 50.7 in August from 51.8 in July.
A number above 50 indicates an expansion.
New orders declined and factories experienced breaches at a time of rising tensions between the EU and Russia over Ukraine.
The figures are due to be published before the European Central Bank (ECB) meeting on Thursday.
Markets expect the Bank to have a clear plan for dealing with a hesitant recovery in the euro area and for impending deflation at an inflation rate of just 0.3%.
There is speculation that the head of the ECB, Mario Draghi, could give further information later this week on whether he is considering a quantitative easing for the eurozone, in line with those undertaken by the UK and the US during the financial crisis.
"Although small growth is better than no growth at all, the braking effects of increasing economic and geopolitical uncertainties have become more apparent for manufacturers", said Rob Dobson, senior economist at Markit.
The factory PMI for Germany, Russia's largest trading partner in the EU, fell to its lowest level in 11 months at 51.4.
Meanwhile, in the second largest economic nation in the bloc, France, the PMI fell to 46.9.
France remains a child of concern, as is Italy's descent from a solid expansion to stagnation.
The evidence that growth incentives in the key industrial mechanism are no longer in force in Germany, Spain and the Netherlands is also not reassuring,' said Mr Dobson.
The decline in industry is likely to fuel the fires of analysts who expect further monetary or fiscal incentives.
A positive report came from the Republic of Ireland, where the PMI rose to 57.3, the highest level since the end of 1999.
Howard Archer, chief economist at IHS Global Insight, said: "The best thing to say about the August purchasing manager index of the euro area manufacturing sector is that the sector will continue to grow after that".
He added: "It is obvious that the current situation in the euro area is quite difficult for producers, as the current heightened geopolitical tensions, particularly with regard to Russia and Ukraine, are exacerbating uncertainties in many countries, in the still difficult conditions.
These increased uncertainties have clearly affected the economy - in particular, and consumer confidence - and are likely to lead to delays or even cancellations of some orders, particularly large ones.
He said that it was "increasingly likely" that the ECB would eventually have to introduce some form of QE, "although we suspect that this will be limited".
The hellish decade of Beslan survivors: Ten years have passed since the terrible siege of the school, which still afflicts the children involved.
Ten years ago, over 1,000 people were taken hostage by Chechen militias at a school in Beslan, southern Russia.
More than 330 people, more than half of them children, were killed in the three-day martyrdom that shocked the world.
We returned to Beslan to find some of the victims who had escaped the death of the classroom atrocity.
Exactly a decade after the horrific siege of Beslan School, which killed 334 people, including 186 children, the heroic survivors warned last night of a new apocalypse in Ukraine.
As fanatical Islamist terrorists captured and killed children and parents on September 1, 2004, the beginning of a new school year, it seemed like the worst of evil.
The tragedy united West and East in horror, and then, surprisingly, turned into action and hope for the future amidst the worst misery.
Ten years later, we returned to Beslan to find some of the victims who had escaped the death of the classroom atrocity.
We found surprising young people who have overcome resistance, even though the memory of this terrorist hell will haunt them forever.
Your greatest hope?
That the war that is now plaguing Ukraine - and in which children like them die - will now end.
The girl who was photographed trying to climb back into the destroyed school gymnasium
She was photographed and made famous by Russian star photographer Dmitry Beliakov, when she was only trying to climb back into the destroyed school gymnasium in her underwear after a mine exploded.
Completely confused, Aida looked for her mother, now 40 years old.
Both were presumed dead, but they survived.
"A woman told me to run for my life, but I couldn't", Aida said at the time.
My legs were covered in blood.
I got up and climbed back in to look for my mother.
A soldier brought her to safety.
After a series of surgeries, she thought she was completely cured, but yesterday she said, "Three months ago, the pain came back.
I'm afraid I'll have to have another operation.
Some of the shrapnel is still in my knee.
Her goal now is to become a dentist to help people, as she was helped by doctors.
"This tragedy changed my life, but it didn't break me", she says.
"It happened to me, and you can't change that.
Once a year, I always go to the gym to remember the ones who stayed there.
My friends and I try not to talk about it on other days.
The pain is too much.
My best friend and future classmate, Dzera Gapoeva, was killed there.
We used to play together when we were little, and we dreamed of going to school together.
"I don't want to get married until I finish my studies and start my career.
I'll think of a family later.
She says the siege will always remain a part of her, although her memory is getting a little weaker every year.
I'm glad that many people around the world still remember our horrors and we're so grateful for the help we've received from people in the UK and around the world.
When I see a picture of me climbing back to school online, I think a lot of people seeing it for the first time, understanding our disaster, and helping to prevent something like this from happening again.
The boy who escaped through the bullet hook, believing his mother was dead
It was his first day of school (Russians go to school at age 7) and survived the three-day siege in the arms of his mother Tamara.
When he was seven, he said, "Mama told me to lie down if there was an explosion and hold her hand".
After an explosion, he thought she was going to die.
She said to him, "Run".
Fearing that she might be dead, he ran away and saw a crying little child on the way, grabbed it by the hand and ran through a bullet hook.
His father, Vladimir, who was holding his son outside, said: "Damir told me that his mother had died.
He said, "I couldn't save her".
In fact, Tamara had been walking outside with leg injuries in the hospital, assuming her son had died.
After their reunion, she said: "I cried for joy.
I couldn't believe it.
He ran in and hugged me.
Damir was later flown to London (by the now-defunct News of the World) to receive the title of Barnardo's Children's Champion from then-Prime Minister Tony Blair and his wife Cherie.
"This horror haunts you every day, but I wish I could stop remembering", he said yesterday.
But I can tell you it's getting bloated in my memory.
I remember throwing away all my toy guns right after.
But now I can play computer games with shooting scenes, and that's no problem for me.
"I'm not afraid to go back to the gym, but I don't think about myself.
I remember those kids I played with in the yard and they didn't make it out.
We never say they were killed or dead.
We say they're staying in the gym.
I remember very well my trip to London, especially the toy store, where I could pick up anything I wanted, and the ride in an open carriage upstairs.
But now he's afraid of places like Ukraine where wars cause the kind of misfortune he and his friends suffered.
This horror haunts you every day, but I wish I could stop remembering it.
"I feel so sorry for all those who suffer atrocities", said Damir, who volunteered at a convent last week.
I'm so happy to help.
I want to go to the police one day and hope they take me to the training academy next year.
His mother, Tamara, 48, said, "37 children from our neighborhood were killed, can you imagine that?
I remember the terrible silence after the siege, there were simply no children who could scream and walk around, and that silence lasted for many months.
She remembers vividly her trip to London with Damir.
People in London were crying when I told them our story.
I understood then how people on the other side of the world can understand our feelings and show their support.
She was grateful to Cherie Blair and her foundation for the prize and the opportunity to travel to London in the fall of 2004.
I wish I could call Cherie and just tell her myself that it's been 10 years, but I still remember meeting her and her husband in London, and how that helped Damir and me.
I remember Damir liked to eat borscht and calling all the local Russian restaurants.
I remember him playing with waiters in a restaurant, and Damir shot them with his water gun, and they ran away and played with him.
And that was just a month after the horror.
I was surprised that the British were so willing to share our pain and support us.
She said, "I always think this world hasn't gotten better in 10 years.
In Ukraine, the war is going on now, and every day people are dying, and I believe that many children have been killed and are still being killed.
They're just like our kids.
I think for many, war is part of the news they hear when they're bored or busy with something else.
I just know what these people are feeling, all the horror.
And I can't stop feeling that.
Nothing has changed, people still want to kill each other and that's so sad.
Damir grew up and is a very gentle and calm boy, he is not aggressive or angry at all.
For example, he is not seeking revenge, he is not overwhelmed by past atrocities.
I know he doesn't like to remember it, but he has six close friends in his class, and they go to the gym occasionally and light candles.
When he was little, he suffered from it - I remember sometimes lying on the couch, facing away from us for hours.
Not asleep, his eyes were open.
I also remember throwing away all his weapons and other military toys, Damir is now 17, taller than me, handsome, intelligent, and healthy.
I can't believe I was so sure for hours that he was dead and I would never see him again.
When I was recovering from the explosion and getting back on my feet, I looked around, and I saw hell all around me, with body parts all around me.
I was absolutely sure that my little boy could not have survived in this hell.
"I remember yelling at him, "Damir, run, run away", but I was also so sure he didn't hear me.
But he heard it and he ran away.
And that's how life, unlike many others, goes on for us.
Georgij Ilyin, 17
The boy whose terrible image after the siege became a symbol of the atrocities of Beslan
Consolation: Beslan survivor Georgij Lyin with his mother Fatima after the siege of 2004, right a picture of Georgij today
His blood-stained face was marked by fear as he ran for his life while Chechen terrorists shot down his classmates.
His image was one of the most shocking symbols of Beslan's barbarism.
His mother, Fatima, 54, a doctor, had dropped him off for his first day of school before she rushed to take her older son, Vladimir, to university.
"I left the yard about two minutes before the terrorists stormed it, and so my little boy was left there alone for three terrible days", she recalls.
Not all alone, there was a whole family of relatives of ours, but they were all killed.
Only my Georgij managed to survive.
The closer we get to that date, the harder it is to think about it and talk about it.
There isn't a day that we don't remember this tragedy.
We don't think it's been a long time, I mean, it was yesterday, some scenes from these days are always following me.
No one will ever forget that, I promise you.
Impressive: The image of Georgij (left) was one of the most shocking of the attack and was immortalized as a statue (right).
I remember that day when Georgij wanted to go to school so badly, he said he wanted to hug his teacher.
I didn't know he was alive until I saw him on TV.
And now there's even this crying Georgian statue in San Marino.
Georgij doesn't like the picture, and it's hidden in our house in the bookshelf.
I understand that, but I also think that people all over the world feel our pain because of this image.
Georgij says today: "It is important that this never happens again.
"I doubt we'll ever know the truth.
People study such tragedies over and over again and never know the truth.
And now they're investigating the crash of that Boeing in Ukraine.
Will we ever find out what caused it?
This world is becoming something terrible.
"I can't understand how this is possible, because if you ask people, nobody wants a war, so how does this happen?
Ten years is nothing in this kind of pain.
It takes us decades to forget it a little bit.
It's attacked my health and I still feel it.
For about three or four years, I had some nightmares about the siege, but then it got better.
I went back to school in 2004 and I was scared every day.
I thought about my friends and classmates who had been killed.
That's why I always go to the gym when September 1st comes.
I want to pay tribute to my old childhood friends.
It's hard for me to go to the gym, but I have to.
I don't feel like a victim, this story is now part of my past.
I won't forget, but I won't feel sorry for myself.
My life goes on.
I graduated from school this year and I am attending a medical college in the Vladivostok.
I'm going to be a heart surgeon.
My first choice was an army training.
I wanted to be a soldier, but my health wouldn't allow it.
I wanted to fight for my country, but that's not going to happen.
Georgy Fanijev, 20
The boy who survived being caught at the feet of a murderous terrorist
A miracle: Georgy Fanijev was captured at the feet of a murderous terrorist during the siege, but he managed to survive.
During the siege, he was trapped in the gym and sat next to the bomb that was attached to the foot of a murderous terrorist.
It's a miracle he wasn't killed.
"We feel like it was yesterday", says Georgij, who wanted to go to the FSB as an intelligence officer, but was unable to do so because of his health damage from the siege.
It's still with me, it's nothing I left behind.
I'm older now and people say that kids can easily deal with bad experiences - I have to say that's not true.
"I worked with psychologists in 2006 and I actually felt a little better after that, but I can't forget it.
And I'd like to forget.
2005 -- the year after that -- was the first and only time I went back to the gym.
I lost consciousness.
I'm never going back there and please don't ask me to show you where I sat in this famous picture.
Survivor: Georgy Fanijev today, with a photo of himself in the hospital after the siege on the laptop
My pain is immense and I carry it with me every day.
My friends know I don't like to think about it or talk about it and they never ask me about school.
I'm fine physically.
I should be careful with my injured knee, but I can walk fine now.
But because of my health, I couldn't go to the FSB Secret Service Academy in St. Petersburg as I wanted.
I sent in my medical records, and they said it wasn't possible.
My second passion was animals, so I went to the veterinary institute.
I've been out there for two years.
He learns to treat all animals, "from cats to cows".
He said: "I knew I would never tell my children about my experiences.
Children should know nothing about it and they should of course not suffer it.
His mother, Marina, 42, said: "This pain never leaves me.
He's in my soul, worse as the anniversary approaches.
I'm going to the memorial service.
I know Georgij won't go.
It must be a lot harder for him because he was there and I wasn't.
I waited at home for him and couldn't help it.
I'm so grateful to God that he's been returned to me.
It stays inside us.
Georgij is an adult now, but that horror is still in him.
It's hard to accept that when something so unfair happens to you.
He's a boy, he likes sports, but he can't participate because of his knee.
He's had multiple surgeries, he can walk, but he doesn't play sports.
I'd say he's over 50% of the horror, but you can never completely overcome it and forget it.
This terrible experience will always haunt us.
Many friends and neighbors were killed during the siege, and that only adds to my pain.
I lost a lot of people I knew well and loved.
My son is with me, and this is the greatest gift God could give me, but my heart is crying for the dead.
I know of families where new children were born, but also of widows who never remarried.
It's hard to accept that life goes on, even if you don't want to.
I'll never forget how my heart leaped when I saw him in the hospital.
And now I see what's happening in the world -- wars in other regions.
What are these people fighting for?
Why are they killing each other?
The war is very close to our country now and I can hardly believe it.
We used to be a friendly country, how can we be fighting now?
People and children are suffering, and I am sure that in Ukraine many children have already been killed and many more are being killed.
If only we could catch all these rebels and throw them out as far away as possible.
Aljona Tskaeva, 10 years old
The baby that was so grippingly carried by a special operations command to safety
Rescued: Aljona Tskayeva is being taken to safety by a Russian special operations command (left).
She 's ten now (right) and she doesn 't remember the atrocities at all .
The world stopped breathing in 2004 when the baby Aljona was carried in the arms of a Russian policeman from the Beslan siege.
The terrorists let them go, but in their cruelty they kept their 30-year-old mother, 10-year-old sister Kristina and their brother Makhar in the school gym.
Makhar, then three years old, escaped, but Aljona's mother and sister died in the murderous massacre.
Her father Ruslan has since remarried and has a little girl with his new wife Swetlana, whom he named after his lost daughter Kristina.
Aljona, now ten years old, has no memory of the siege and has grown up to be a smart and happy girl, neighbors say.
"They are now a big happy family and Aljona and Makhar are both great children", says a close friend.
Ruslan is a fantastic father and wants to spare them all the memories that come up on their tenth anniversary.
You'll understand why.
Man accused of overtaking girls at pedestrian crossing in Fife

4 Tips for Better Underwater Photos and Videos
If you like to take photos or videos underwater, there are a variety of devices.
The cheapest option is a waterproof point-and-shoot, like the Nikon Coolpix AW120 or an action camera like the GoPro Hero3+ Silver Edition, both of which are available for about $300.
I took these photos at a family party with multiple cameras, all of which are available for under $350.
Regardless of the equipment, there are a few rules for the best results.
Check your equipment twice.
Even if you have a waterproof camera, make sure the battery case and other cases are tightly sealed.
Also, set your camera to the photos or videos you want to record.
Some cameras and camcorders have scene and recording modes to optimize exposure time for the underwater conditions at dusk.
And before you jump in, check how deep your equipment is capable of functioning.
Some cameras are only allowed up to 5 feet, others up to 50 or 60 feet.
Look in our shopping guide and the reviews for digital cameras for conventional and waterproof models.
Take multiple shots, because many of them won't work.
Point-and-shoot cameras have an LCD to make images, but action cameras don't usually.
Even if you have an LCD, it's hard to see it underwater, and the right image setting is a lucky thing.
So you take a lot of pictures.
If your camera has a row mode that allows you to take a series of shots with slightly altered exposure settings, use it.
Stay close to the surface.
The light gets dramatically worse the further you move away from the surface.
So if possible, stay close to the surface when you take pictures in a pool, lake or ocean.
It also allows you to add more color to your photos; the deeper you go, the less color you'll see.
Get close to the objects.
That's good advice on land, too, but it's all the more important underwater because of the bad lighting conditions.
It's especially important when you're working with an action camera: These devices often have a fixed wide angle lens, which means you need to get closer to your objects if they're going to fill the entire frame.
Andrew Lawson was a man of the sort whose character changed things, even in an organization as gigantic as the NHS.
As a consultant anaesthetist, he devoted his career to the task of saving the sick from both the agony of the disease and the torment of treatment.
Among his patients, his wife recalls, was an MI6 employee who had to live with the devastating effects of torture.
Lawson knew that doctors were concerned about diagnoses and diseases, while those being treated were mostly concerned about something else entirely: pain.
But one day in 2007, he was the one whose path of suffering began.
"I didn't feel it", he wrote in May of this year.
I had trouble getting up.
While struggling with flu-like symptoms, he noticed that he was impatiently blaming his wife, Juliet.
"I want everything now rather than later", he noted.
When Juliet was on a business trip for a week, Lawson felt unusually and unnecessarily worried.
Something was in the air.
He asked a colleague to do an X-ray of his chest.
Only two weeks ago, he was skiing in the French Alps.
The X-ray results were correct.
He suffered from mesothelioma, an incurable cancer that attacks the chest skin, the skin that covers the lungs.
As with most cancers, the exact cause is often difficult to determine.
For example, while some smokers have lung cancer, not all lung cancer patients have been smokers in the past.
But mesothelioma is different.
In almost all cases, the trigger is asbestos exposure - contact with the fiber material, once considered a "miracle" but now found deadly.
For most of us, mesothelioma is a disease that can be easily ignored.
Asbestos is a product of the past.
The most dangerous type of asbestos has been discontinued in the UK since the 1960s when industry voluntarily committed to discontinuing its use.
Even where it was still used, only people in certain industries worked directly with the fabric - plumbers, construction workers, carpenters and shipyard workers, for example.
As an industrial hazard from another era, it seems hardly of concern today.
But this self-satisfaction is inappropriate.
Britain, it seems, is now experiencing the peak of a mesothelioma epidemic.
There are more mesothelioma deaths here than in any other country in the world.
With a total of 2,500 deaths a year, this disease kills twice as many people as traffic accidents.
Annual figures of mesothelioma deaths since 1980 and expected future deaths in the UK
The reason we're experiencing the deadly effects now, even though asbestos has been illegal for years (all types of asbestos were banned in 1999) is that mesothelioma doesn't develop until decades later.
And the scourge of mesothelioma is not limited to former construction workers.
Asbestos was, and still is, common in the homes we live in, the offices we work in, the schools we study in, and the shops we shop in.
And therefore, mesothelioma has no classroom boundaries, financial boundaries, occupations, or age.
The privileged bastions, from the elegant London department stores to private schools, are no shelter.
The parliament buildings are contaminated with asbestos.
Even in the hospitals where we are supposed to be cured, this deadly carcinogen has been identified as a starting point.
Andrew Lawson was not old.
He wasn't a plumber either.
In fact, he found it difficult to imagine where he might have come into contact with asbestos.
Then he found out.
"It looks like there was a lot of asbestos in the tunnels at Guy's Hospital, where I trained for six years", he wrote.
All students, nurses, doctors and doormen use the tunnels.
I wonder how many of my peers will suffer from the same disease?
Unfortunately, he was able to answer that question at least in part.
"Of the four doctors trained at Guy's Hospital who have been suffering from mesothelioma for the past five years", he wrote in a 2010 letter, "I am the last one alive".
How many of us will still get sick?
Andrew Lawson was diagnosed with mesothelioma at age 48.
When he died on February 17th of this year, he was 55.
It was an unusually long survival time.
Fifty percent of all mesothelioma patients die within eight months of diagnosis.
The disease always ends in death.
So we can only repeat Lawson's question: "How many of us will still be sick?"
Britain's leading expert on mesothelioma, Professor Julian Peto, estimates that between 1870 and 2050, when the asbestos epidemic in Britain is expected to end, a total of 90,000 of the disease will have fallen victim.
Most of them have no idea they're going to die like this.

A brief look at the court records, which are often used by those affected to seek compensation, shows how widespread the plague of mesothelioma is already.
In June of this year, for example, Marks & Spencer admitted to negligently exposing Janice Allen to asbestos.
She worked for the chain for nine years, from 1978 to 1987, and was responsible for the clothing department at two locations - one of which was the flagship store on Oxford Street.
Mrs. Allen was only 18 when she started her career at M&S.
Now she has two children in their twenties.
"Before this thing", she says, "I had never heard of mesothelioma, I didn't even really know anything about asbestos.
I never thought it would ever affect me.
There are few people who know much about asbestos.
The fact is that the term asbestos does not refer to a substance, but to a group of six minerals.
The name comes from the word "asbestos", a description of the fiber structure that makes the fabric resistant and flexible.
Three of the six were used in the construction industry.
Chrysotile, also known as white asbestos, is by far the most common asbestos found in buildings today.
It was used for roofing, floor planing, pipe drainage, bore laying, even for brake lining in cars.
It is less lethal than other forms of asbestos, but is still considered a "major health risk" by the EU and WHO with potential mortality.
However, brown asbestos (amose) and blue asbestos (crocodolite) are more dangerous.
Britain was once the world's largest importer of brown asbestos, and experts suspect that "there is clear but indirect evidence that this was a major reason for the uniquely high mesothelioma rates".

Janice Allen may not have considered herself a typical mesothelioma victim, but Julian Peto's work suggests that her story is by no means unusual.
He presented a study of the subjects showing that "a significant proportion of mesothelioma without known exposure by work or at home was probably caused by exposure to asbestos in the environment".
He said that much of this contact is based on the "normal use and ageing" of our buildings.
It seems that no one can assume safety.
A report by Goddard Consulting, which examined the Palace of Westminster, shows how people in the heart of government could have been unwittingly exposed to the substance.
In 2009, Goddard reported that the service shafts and pipelines behind the Parliament committee rooms were contaminated with asbestos, whose deadly fibers could be stirred by something as harmless as "strong air movement".
Parliamentarians are often accused of taking care of their own interests, but here it seems that the opposite is true.
While the Parliamentary Labour Service Directorate insisted that the Palace of Westminster had been granted a 'clean health certificate', it is now undeniable that over several years, £1 billion of work must be spent to renovate Parliament, modernise electrical installations and remove asbestos, and that after the 2015 general election MPs will likely meet at the nearby QE2 Conference Centre rather than the green benches in Westminster.
The Goddard report also pointed out that 'the presence of asbestos was not handled in accordance with the relevant regulations'.
No one can know if this mismanagement will cost lives.
All you can do now is wait.
One person who never really knew the exact contact with asbestos is Graham Abbott, a general practitioner.
Like Andrew Lawson, Abbott, 50, suspects that he was exposed to asbestos while working in hospitals.
"I worked at a hospital where asbestos cases were decided positively", he says, "but I can't prove it in my case.
It's so hard to remember all the places you've worked and the dates.
What he remembers most accurately is the day in early December 2009, when he got this kind of fever.
He was 45 and had an operation late this evening.
Suddenly I got a little chills.
It came all of a sudden.
I felt terrible.
I thought I couldn't make it home.
As a doctor, Abbott knew that the pain was coming from the chest, the skin around his lungs.
But like Janice Allen, he had no reason to suspect mesothelioma.
He didn't go to work for a month.
The wounded doctors took X-rays of his chest and used pleurakathether to extract fluid from his lungs and test it in the lab.
His complaints, however, remained undiagnosed.
His health slowly improved, and he returned to his workplace.
From time to time, however, symptoms returned, often after exercise and heavy breathing.
In 2011, a patient of Abbott's came into his practice with similar symptoms and was later diagnosed with mesothelioma.
But even now Abbott didn't link this to his own case.
After all, his patient was several decades older and had worked directly with asbestos.
The connection in this case was clear.
In September 2011, Abbott's condition worsened again, and his family doctor brought his CT scans and X-rays to an expert group.
In December 2011, exactly two years after Abbott first felt ill, a camera-equipped probe was introduced into the cavity between the rib and chest.
I'm an optimist.
I usually just keep going", he says.
Honestly, I wasn't so worried.
But Rachel, my wife, was worried.
The biopsy results were in the week between Christmas and New Year: "I was told it was mesothelioma".
Graham Abbott: Diagnosis of mesothelioma
All of a sudden, Abbott was meeting with Macmillan nurses, and one of them recommended that he get a lawyer.
Only now did he understand the extent of the epidemic.
"It turned out that asbestos was very widespread, especially in large public buildings where pipes were often insulated with asbestos", he says.
The people who were exposed to asbestos in these buildings are now sick.
And so mesothelioma now affects younger people who haven't worked in the typical professions.
The most dangerous asbestos insulation pipes in hospitals were underground, so patients were probably not exposed to the material.
But many employees who moved from one building to another in pedestrian tunnels (like Andrew Lawson) or ate in underground canteens (as Graham Abbott often did) were most likely exposed to the toxic substances.
It turns out that for decades after the war, hospitals were potentially life-saving for patients, but life-threatening for the doctors who treated them.
He's still being removed today.
Students put their bun burners on asbestos mats.
And it's not just about hospitals.
Asbestos has been used extensively in offices, shops, libraries and city halls because of its fabulous insulating and flame retardant properties.
Schools too.
In fact, many people may have had their first exposure to asbestos in the classroom.
Across the country, in thousands of chemical hours, students have set their bun burners on asbestos mats.
Asbestos is now a common topic on websites in schools.
And meanwhile, innocent objects in our homes like floorboards or shed ceilings have asbestos as standard.
"It's an industrial poison that's found in large parts of our properties", notes Andrew Morgan, the lawyer who represented Andrew Lawson in his trial against Guy's Hospital.
In one case, the only contact that occurred to a woman involved was the demolition of a garden shed in the 1970s.
So be careful how you tear your garden sheds apart.
The impact of diagnosis, and the knowledge that the disease is incurable, is immense.
"It takes a while to process that", says Graham Abbott.
I went back to work and tried to keep going, but I realized I couldn't concentrate on what I was doing.
I was in practice for two weeks.
Then I knew I had to go and take care of myself.
Well, I'm not going to see another Christmas.
The biggest challenge was changing the perspective from a doctor's position to a patient's.
Like countless patients before him, he remembers how overwhelmed he was by all the information he had to deal with.
"It was very difficult to record all of this", he says.
"I asked my doctor, 'How much time do I have?'
And I was given about 12 months.
I remember thinking, "Well, I'm not going to see another Christmas.
That was it.
Mesothelioma is especially treacherous because it's our life-sustaining mechanism -- the breathing itself -- that causes the deadly cancer.
Most cases of mesothelioma are caused by asbestos contact.
Asbestos is made up of the smallest fibers.
When the asbestos is agitated and the fibers inhaled, they can become attached to the chest, the skin around the lungs.
Asbestos fibers irritate the chest and can trigger cell mutations.
"The problem is with the inhaled needle-shaped asbestos fibers", says Professor Tom Treasure, a cardiothoracic surgeon who moved to Guy's Hospital in 2001.
And it's the hospital that Andrew Lawson suspects exposed him to asbestos that is now, ironically, a leading center for mesothelioma treatment.
Treasure knew Lawson and treated several others who were also likely exposed to asbestos during their training at the hospital.
Once the asbestos needles reach the lung tissue, Treasure says, "they are pushed to the edge where the skin is by the breathing process.
It's naturally invasive from the start.
The usual options for other cancers don't work as well with mesothelioma.
The effectiveness of surgery, for example, is hotly debated.
Some people think it's worth a try.
Treasure denies that.
"You can't cut out the pectoral", he says.
You don't get around with that knife.
Meanwhile, the cancer "does not speak very well on chemotherapy", which "shows effect", but does not cure.
"Sometimes there are long-term survivors", Treasure says.
But in the end, they all die.
Fortunately, some patients actually live a long, much longer life than expected.
Author Stephen Jay Gould died 20 years after the diagnosis.
Two and a half years after his own diagnosis, Graham Abbott is still fighting.
After contacting mesothelioma, Abbott contacted Andrew Lawson, who had become a one-man support and counseling agency for fellow patients four years after his diagnosis.
"Hello, cancer center", he said, cheerfully, when he got the call.
"He was very positive", says Abbott.
He had been diagnosed four years earlier and was still very active.
Abbott was originally offered six chemotherapy cycles lasting four months, which were expected to prolong his life by only one month.
"I was desperate", he says.
I was about to give up.
Lawson, however, managed to "bring things into a slightly more positive light".
After consulting several doctors, Abbott decided to continue his treatment with Professor Loic Lang-Lazdunski, a cardiothorax specialist at Guy's.
"We had the advantage of not having to be redirected, I just called and got an appointment", admits Graham.
A normal patient would have to receive a referral and wait for treatment approval.
Money is crucial for mesothelioma patients to receive the best available therapies.
But when these treatments ultimately fail, many suffer from another financial concern - the future of the families they leave behind.
And so they turn to the courts in the hope of compensation.
Andrew Lawson contacted Andrew Morgan of Field Fisher Waterhouse LLP.
"It has been known since 1898 that asbestos is extremely dangerous to health", says Morgan.
But what changed in the 1960s was that they realized that even very little exercise was a health risk.
And this is where the negligence of the companies started to play a role.
Andrew Lawson and Guy's Hospital eventually filed their case, but it wasn't what Morgan calls "full compensation", because Lawson couldn't prove with absolute certainty that his mesothelioma was due to asbestos contact with Guy's.
However, after the investigation into his death, a Guy's spokesman confirmed that "the asbestos fibers in the affected basement area were removed in the 1990s".
It was too late for Andrew Lawson.
How to remove asbestos
In fact, for mesothelioma patients seeking compensation, it is a huge problem to attribute the fatal exposure of asbestos to a company or workplace - usually decades after the incidents.
Many of her former employers have been sold or closed.
Insurance documents can be lost.
And those who stand up to claims know that time is theirs, but certainly not with the plaintiffs.
In response, there were significant new legislation this year that makes it easier for mesothelioma sufferers to claim compensation even if their previous employers are no longer available.
The Act has set up a £350 million insurance industry-funded fund for all those diagnosed after July 2012 who can prove contact but cannot sue anyone.
In these cases, the plaintiffs receive 80 percent of what a court could have awarded them in a normal damages case - about £120,000.
Approximately 300 successful applications are expected to be submitted to the programme each year.
Andrew Morgan, like so many mesothelioma sufferers, thinks that £350 million was a "very good job" for the insurance industry.
"This is a deal from insurers to insurers", he says, indicating that this sum is a quarter of what insurers would have had to pay if time hadn't passed and mesothelioma patients could find the companies and sue them normally.
Mike Penning, then minister of labor and pensions, also admitted that the law was "not perfect".
But both Penning and Morgan admitted that, given the seven deaths every day, swift action was necessary.
"People are suffering so much and need help today", Penning said during the second hearing of the Mesothelioma Act last December.
At that time, Graham Abbott had been in the hands of Professor Loic Lang-Lazdunski for 19 months.
After their initial consultations, Lang-Lazdunski recommended an operation from which he expects a positive effect, unlike Tom Treasure.
This was accompanied by radiation therapy and chemotherapy - a triple therapy that allows Lang-Lazdunski to have a five-year survival rate of up to 40 percent.
Abbott felt empowered.
"That's the most important thing, of course", Abbott says.
You see that in patients all the time.
There's something there that keeps you going.
If you give up, you'll get worse very quickly.
Graham Abbott underwent the operation in March 2012.
By the end of August, he had completed the last of his six chemotherapy cycles.
Post-care scans showed no signs of the disease.
Then I had a scan in March 2014.
There were several cancer spots around my chest.
I just turned 50.
It's not life-threatening.
It's life-threatening.
Abbott underwent six more cycles of chemotherapy.
Now no trace of the tumors is visible.
But the process is very physically and mentally exhausting.
You need to think about practical things -- about money when I'm gone, for example, or show my wife how the boiler timing works.
If you get bad news, you get negative.
You need to look ahead.
Being the father of Ellie, 16, and Tamsin, 14, is not always easy.
"It's hard for parents", he says.
It's hard to know what to say and how much.
When I was first diagnosed, I told my girl I had a disease that I wouldn't grow old with.
They reacted very differently.
Tamsin is very sociable and rude.
She told her friends and we got a lot of calls.
Ellie was more restrained.
She didn't say much.
These kinds of conversations are something that all cancer patients have to go through.
But for mesothelioma patients, such conversations are not filled with hope, not a trail of hope for survival.
The disease (and ultimately Stephen Jay Gould) is a grim safety.
As Andrew Morgan says, "Mesothelioma is not life-threatening.

China denies Hong Kong the right to vote, protesters swear revenge
On Sunday, despite the growing calls for democratic reforms, the Chinese parliament voted against the nomination of candidates for the 2017 elections by the Hong Kong electorate.
This action is likely to fuel the long-anticipated protests in Hong Kong's business district, while activists are planning and mobilizing within hours of the announcement.
The decision of the Chinese People's Congress allows the Communist leaders to reject all candidates who are not loyal to Beijing.
"This is not unexpected, but it makes us angry", said legal expert Emily Lau, chair of the Democratic Party.
That's not what Beijing promised.
The people of Hong Kong have been lied to.
And it's clear that we're dealing with an authoritarian regime.
In his defense of the Chinese decision, Li Fei, deputy secretary general of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, said that the approval of public nominations in the elections for the Hong Kong government would be too "chaotic".
Since 1997, when Britain handed back control of Hong Kong to the Chinese, Beijing has promised to let the people vote for the government chairman from 2017.
The Chinese leadership described Sunday's decision as a democratic breakthrough because Hong Kong's citizens have the right to vote directly, but the decision also makes clear that the Chinese leadership is firmly in control of the process through a nomination committee tightly controlled by Beijing.
The new clause also says that only candidates "with love for the country and love for Hong Kong" will be admitted.
The decision follows a summer in which some of the largest and most public-facing protests in Hong Kong have taken place in several years.
The pro-democracy campaign in Hong Kong is behind the Occupy Central With Love and Peace movement, whose organizers have threatened to shut down the financial district if Beijing does not allow genuine universal suffrage.
On Sunday evening, within hours of the announcement, hundreds of Occupy Central supporters had gathered in the rain outside the government headquarters in Hong Kong.
At the demonstration, the organizers said their movement had reached a new level of civil disobedience and they were planning protests in the coming weeks.
However, they did not provide any further details, apparently to avoid problems with the authorities.
In an online statement, the organizers said that the movement "has considered the occupation of the Central District only as a last resort, an action that should only take place when all dialogue opportunities are exhausted and there is no other option.
We regret to say that today all the opportunities for dialogue have been exhausted and the occupation of the Central District will definitely take place.
Hong Kong authorities have been preparing for Beijing's announcement for days, and security measures including police and barricades were in place outside the government building on Sunday.
The unrest is being heightened by the feeling that many in Hong Kong are slowly losing control of their city.
The movement of people from the mainland increases competition for products and services.
There is also growing fear that Hong Kong's values such as democracy and freedom of speech will begin to crumble under increasing pressure from Beijing.
Some criticized the Occupy Central demonstrations as endangering business operations - the lifeblood of Hong Kong.
"The protests they speak of could cause great economic damage depending on how many people are involved and how long they last", said legal expert Regine Ip, who has long criticized the movement.
We don't want to create fears that Hong Kong is going to get out of control.
This is a bad impression for investments.
State-controlled Chinese media also recently reported on Hong Kong's democracy activists as subversive agents controlled by Western powers.
This summer, activists organized an unofficial referendum on voting rights, which attracted 780,000 people - more than a fifth of Hong Kong's electorate.
In July, tens of thousands took part in one of the largest democratic demonstrations in the region's history.
The tradition of proms in the United States is now being transferred to universities, where freshmen are offered private jet performances.
We are delighted to be able to respond to this demand and offer the first luxury travel service in Britain for today's students.
To make a particularly impressive appearance at the university, the company also offers transport options such as private jets, Rolls-Royce Phantom, Aston Marten or McLaren P1.
Mr Stewart also stated that the service has a security department.
This service is an ideal alternative for students who would otherwise have to move their belongings around the country in a dangerously overloaded car.
Together with our new VIF options, we look forward to making sure that students go to university this year with minimal effort and maximum luxury.
A company spokesman said that no new bookings were available as the service had just been introduced, but added that "students will book the service in the coming weeks".
The company also stated that despite the tuition fees of £9000 per year, it expects to have a market for this offer.
Students today are very different in their expectations and demands from students 10, 20, 30, or 40 years ago - it's more important than ever to make a great first impression, and with VIF you can do just that.
However, the National Student Union criticized the service as being dismissed.
Megan Dunn, NUS's vice president of higher education, said: "This offer seems completely separate from the lives of the majority of students.
Many students who start their studies this month are facing a cost-of-living crisis as the available loans and scholarships do not keep up with the rising bills for the simplest basic necessities of life before they can even think of spending thousands of pounds on something as simple as coming to a student residence.
Feminists criticize race and police behaviour after Ferguson
The unarmed teenager was killed earlier this month by a police officer in Ferguson, Mo.
The participants raised their hands in the air and sang, "Hands up, don't shoot", while they waited for the funeral.
After two weeks of protests in Ferguson, Mo., over the shooting of unarmed teenager Michael Brown, blogger Miriam Zoila Perez noticed a change in online discussions of white feminists.
In their experience, white feminist commentators put gender before race when it comes to addressing reproductive rights and income inequality.
But as tensions rose in the Midwest and gained attention across the country, Perez saw that the answers from white women were 100% race-oriented.
Compared with the responses of black women shortly after the August 9 shootings, the personal essays titled "Thinking of Ferguson by a White Woman" and "Feminism Is Not Just About the Oppression of Women" came relatively late.
But for Perez, that was a big change.
"I don't think you'll find many people in feminism who talk about white and privilege in such a high-class way", she said.
People felt compelled to express something about the incidents.
It's characteristic of the crisis we're in and because the situation in Ferguson is so ethnically diverse that they have to express it.
For English professor Koritha Mitchell of Ohio State University, Ferguson brought to light problems that black American women face every day, but are not considered "women's issues" in the cultural sphere.
"I can post something funny on Facebook about myself and my partner and get 150 likes from anywhere", Mitchell said.
When I post about how colored people are under siege in their own country, the silence is deafening.
"How can it be safe for women to talk about a relationship in public, but not about safety in public?" she asked.
For black women like Mitchell, who have studied race, gender and sexuality in the history of the United States, there is no dichotomy between race and gender issues.
For them, black women have not had the luxury of separating themes cleanly; they live in the combined reality every day.
While white women now connect the issues of race and gender in mainstream feminist circles, Angela Hattery, a professor of women's and gender studies at George Mason University, says that their predecessors did the opposite.
"Between 1865 and 1890, at least 10,000 black men were lynched, and the reason was almost always the rape of a white woman", Hattery said.
White women had to be involved in the story to justify the lynching.
For Hattery, the divide between white and black women came to the point where white women's suffrage activists like Susan B. Anthony analyzed the country in the late 19th century and found that the struggle for suffrage could only be successful for one group at a time: women or blacks.
"They made the decision to fight for women's suffrage, and the suffrage of blacks was to come later", Hattery said.
When you think about these things, you become so conscious of why black women don't trust white women.
We didn't do our job well.
We never helped black women protect their husbands and sons.
Even after women were granted the right to vote in 1920, it took another decade for white women to organize against lynching in the Association of Southern Woman for the Prevention of Lynching.
The group was formed almost 40 years after the initial request for help from black women, Mitchell says.
For Mitchell, the wave of white feminist reactions to Ferguson's questions - police behavior, racial discrimination - reflects the time when white feminists were "catching" the problems that black women had been dealing with for generations.
"Wouldn't it be great if the women activists who have such traditional feminist platforms took the right to raise a child as seriously as they do the right to birth control?" asked Mitchell.
Second-generation feminists who built their careers on the fight for reproductive rights and access to birth control are now trying to understand what that means.
The well-known white feminist activist Gloria Steinem went to Facebook two weeks after the shooting of Michael Brown and published a pointered article by Rebecca Carroll, a columnist for the Guardian, calling for more white Americans to protest racism.
"I hope that women who have a different but parallel reason for understanding a inherent danger to the body - and opinions about race that are markedly different in public opinion polls - will lead the way", wrote Steinem.
Although Steinem advocates a more intersectional feminism that addresses racial and gender issues, some of her comments on the racial issue in America have been puzzling.
Christina Sommers, a researcher at the American Enterprise Institute and author of "Who Stole Feminism?" told She The People that young men in the United States, especially young men of color, are "much more vulnerable than their sisters", but Stein's comments about Ferguson stand in contrast to her previous criticism.
There are hundreds of special programs for girls and young women now, but almost none for boys.
But when the White House recently launched a small program, My Brother's Keeper, to help vulnerable young black and Hispanic men, there was a nasty reaction from many feminists, including Gloria Steinem.
The relationship between police and the black community is not the only problem that is pressing the forefront of mainstream feminism.
After the U.S. Border Patrol seized nearly 63,000 unaccompanied minors at the country's southwestern border this year, the issue of immigration reform is also coming to the surface again - this time as a women's issue.
Andrea Mercado, co-chair of We Belong Together, an organization that mobilizes women for immigration reform, said that to re-evaluate the issue as a major women's issue, she only needs to publish the stories of immigrant women.
"These speak for themselves", said Mercado.
When the vast majority of work visas go to male immigrants, the women who accompany them are in a position where they are vulnerable to domestic violence and exploitation.
"These stories are making a sound in women's organizations", she said.
The pig house in Ipswich is for sale.
The picture of a house for sale was removed by real estate agents when it became clear that it showed a large pig making himself comfortable in the living room.
The house, which is free, has a bedroom, is located on a private road in Ipswich and is on the market for £120,000.
The details included a picture of the living room of the house - including a pig that had its head stuck on a sofa.
Realtor Connell said the pig in the photo was the owner's pet.
"However, the photo was published in error and has since been removed", said a company spokeswoman.
In the exhibit, Connells described the former meetinghouse as "a unique single-family home with one bedroom".
Although the broker removed the image from the website, it still appears on advertising material.
The house sale generated interest on social media when some asked if the pig was included in the purchase price.
SW town of Harvey is home to a new millionaire after winning the lottery
A lottery player from Harvey is on this month.
The search for a new millionaire in southwest Perth continues, with a lucky winner receiving nearly $1.1 million from the Saturday lottery draw.
A newsstand in Harvey pulled the jackpot in the first division draw for the second time in five years, after $1 million in November 2009.
The lucky winner, however, has yet to report.
Store owner Steve Forward said the profit is for conversation in the small town southwest of Perth.
The city's talking about nothing else, and everyone's pretty excited.
We thought that such a gain could occur.
Eight WA winners celebrated their first division wins last month, a fitting conclusion for a few happy weeks for the players in the state.
Last week, a Canning Vale player became one of the five millionaires in August after a Belmont couple had made the $7.5 million mega-winner just weeks earlier.
The winning couple had been playing for twenty years and said the win would allow them the opportunity to travel the world and buy a new home.
The Harvey millionaire is the 59th winner of the first division in WA this year, totaling nearly $85 million.
Leonidas was in the Gladiator Arena.
Not only the gladiators stood in the mat on the first Rhine-Bacca Roman Day in the amusement park.
But the attractiveness of the event was strong enough to attract over 1,000 visitors yesterday, who defied the rainy weather and the autumn cold and were relentlessly enthusiastic about the historic spectacle.
There was a colorful array of performances, plays, exhibits and information about the time of the Romans and their significance to the Rhineland.
The main attraction of the day was undoubtedly the martial force of the Amor Mortis Gladiator School, which used every rainy break to demonstrate its robust martial arts in the arena prepared with soft sand.
Gladiator owner Leonidas proved to be a humorous and knowledgeable presenter, sending his men into the ring one after another to heroic duel in various gladiator genres.
First, the "provocators" were in line with a rectangular shield and a short sword, and a leg rail on the left leg and an arm rail on the right arm.
The "Essedarii" followed with a breastplate, a short sword and a lantern, and an iron gladiator helmet, leg and arm protection.
The "retired" was particularly impressive, coming up against the "secutor" with a net, a trigger and a dagger, and after a short fight, knocking the boys to the ground.
Then the swords were shattered metallically, the shields were created, and the flutes were flying through the arena, which could become a fear and concern for the health of the gladiators.
But the imposing "Summa Rudis", the muscular referee, kept an eye on them.
"We wanted to revive Roman everyday life and make the culture of the Roman era possible", explained Lorenz Euskirchen, chairman of the "Friendeskreis Römerkanal" event, the intention behind the spectacle.
After two years of preparation, the park became an "Oppidum Romanum" for one day, a Roman city, as Vice Mayor Claus Wehage noted in his greeting.
After all, the Romans brought not only war and conquest to our region but also the Roman culture and numerous structures that we admire today.
Remnants of it were also to be admired during the Roman days, such as the "Aqueduct Marble" of the eleven-meter high and 1,400-meter-long Roman Canal Bridge, which once stood near Lüftelberg.
The Frontinus Company was opposed to the water and energy supply, and CEO Petra Fricke knew: "We still benefit from the knowledge we had back then".
This is also confirmed by the diploma-level measurement engineer Ralph Heiliger of the Rheinbach Engineering TeamZwei, who introduced the instruments of measurement of the Romans such as the chorobat, the groma or the dioptra.
The Roman villa in Blankenheim presented sketches and models from the excavations of 1894 as well as brick stones from the original hypokaust, the warm air heater that once heated the Roman villa.
Also impressive are the footprints left by wolves and foxes in the clay steps two millennia ago before they were burned.
In 2011, the Land Landgraft Administration of the Rhineland-Palatinate had excavated the remains of a Roman villa in the Nord-Rhineland-Palatinate commercial park.
They found the walls of an industrial building with a barn for drying grain and milling.
The building was probably part of a Villa Rustica, an agricultural estate, archaeologist Dr. Jennifer Morscheiser explained.
She presented a series of finds from these excavations in a glass window, including a large plate, several fine glass vessels, and parts of a decorative necklace.
The villa probably existed from the first to the fourth century AD, until the German invasion of the Roman Rhineland, Morscheiser suspects.
In this way, children also engaged in the Roman windmill game, similar to the modern windmill game, or they wrote their names on wax tablets, as did the Roman students.
At the Roman Thermen Zülpich stand, the children were allowed to make mosaics themselves, at the Rheinbach Glass Museum they were allowed to make glass mosaics, and at the Eifel Nettersheim Nature Center stand, they were allowed to use a heavy stone wheat mill to grind flour for a flatbread or a cereal.
With the original, faithfully rebuilt Roman carriage, pulled by two cold flowers, visitors drove through the amusement park and passed the impressive building of the city's gymnasium, which presented the results of its "Projects of Rome" weeks.
With a Roman week from 13 to 21 September, the municipality of Wachtberg will also join the Roman year 2014 declared throughout the Rhineland, which is to commemorate the death of Emperor Augustus 2,000 years ago.
Together with the Home and History Societies, the Wachtberg Wander-Verein, the Partnership Association and the Oberbachem Laity Players' Club, they will offer thematic walks, a lecture, cook-evenings and school class guides to commemorate Wachtberg's Roman past.
For example, a Roman legionary will tell of his work on the upper Wachtberg, present plants as living monuments from Roman times, and offer a funny lesson on international understanding between a group of Wachtberg "Germans" and related Romans.
The Adendorf Primary School is devoting its work to the theme of Rome during a project week.
With the Roman Week, the numerous, but often no longer visible traces of the Romans in Wachtberg are to be made visible again.
In Wachtberger Town Hall, a small presentation will commemorate the discovery of the Berkman Matron Shrine in 1879.
Ebola: The epidemic is weighing on West Africa's economy
The Ebola epidemic in West Africa is also a major economic blow.
Markets are orphaned and international companies are moving away.
The devastating Ebola epidemic is a major blow to the West African economy.
The crops are rotting in the fields, the mines are abandoned and the markets are orphaned - the virus has hit the region hard.
Some international companies are also already moving away.
"The Ebola epidemic is not only a medical crisis, but also an economic one", says Donald Kaberuka, head of the African Development Bank.
Liberia is the worst affected
"It's a total disaster, we're losing a lot of money", says Alhaji Bamogo, who sells clothes at the second largest market in Liberia's capital Monrovia.
Only those who want to buy food or something to disinfect against Ebola enter the market.
Liberia is the worst affected by the virus, and more than 600 people have died of the fever here alone.
Recently, health authorities said the disease had spread to every corner of the country.
The virus has also spread to Guinea, Sierra Leone and Nigeria.
Overall, more than 1,500 people have died, and thousands more have been infected.
Foreign firms withdraw staff
Companies are expanding their operations throughout the resource-rich countries.
Foreign companies such as Arcelor Mittal are withdrawing their employees, and several international airlines are no longer flying to the affected regions.
Local traders and farmers also react: few merchants leave their homes to buy supplies.
In some quarantined areas of Sierra Leone and Liberia, cocoa and coffee beans, which are important for export, have been rotting in the fields.
The farmers dare not leave their homes for the harvest.
Food shortages
"People will travel less and less", says Philippe De Vreyer, a Paris-based economist in West Africa.
For example, the man who usually goes to the market and sells his vegetables prefers to stay home.
The population is therefore experiencing the immediate and pressing effects of the epidemic: food shortages.
In the markets, the supply of basic foodstuffs such as rice is dwindling.
At the same time, the region, which is heavily dependent on international companies, is threatening to damage its image - with far-reaching consequences.
The biggest risk is that international companies will basically avoid the area for a long time, says Philippe Hugon of the French think tank Iris.
The virus's spread and duration are crucial.
Investors may feel "that it is dangerous to live in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia and therefore to invest", warns Hugon.
The disease is also affecting the struggling national budgets of the Member States.
The disease also affects the already strained state budgets of the affected countries.
Moody's is concerned that its budgets will be severely strained by high healthcare spending and, in addition, by a deteriorating economy.
The African Development Bank has already pledged to provide 60 million dollars (45 million euros) to the health systems of the countries affected.
The effects are also felt in Nigeria, where so far only a few Ebola cases have been diagnosed.
The oil-rich region of the southern Niger Delta has not yet been affected.
Yet, in other parts of the world, many people already stay home for fear of infection.
Reservations in hotels are also falling significantly.
The shooters are celebrating her 50th birthday.
The Berngau association of shooters Tannenwald is celebrating its 50th anniversary from 12 to 14 September.
The Tannenwald Shooter Association is preparing for the 50th anniversary celebration from 12 to 14 September.
A big evening of entertainment with the village rocker group is scheduled for Friday, September 12.
Saturday is the big bullfight at 6:00.
Then, in the large festival tent, the mood evening with the "Stoapfälzer Spitzbuam" will be held.
The Blasket makes the music
Highlights on Sundays are the service and the 9:30 a.m. service in the parish church and the large service at 2 p.m.
In the afternoon, the federal and the shooter's prizes will be distributed.
A particularly beautiful sight will be the 25 bridesmaids with their dirndl.
The party chapel is the Blaskapelle Berngau.
The patronage has been taken over by Mayor Wolfgang Wild and Secretary of State Albert Füracker.
The original name "Schutzgesellschaft Tannenwald Berngau" dates back to 1907, when the association was founded on 21 March 1907 to "entertain society through practice in room support and small-scale shooting".
In 1937, the Nazi regime had caused the dissolution of the association.
Only in 1964 did 19 young men meet again who on 30 April in the Lukas Hotel, the "new" gun club "Tannenwald" Berngau, were baptized.
Karl March and Adolf Ried led the club through a difficult initial period as gunners, where the main focus was on finding a club location and installing the firing operation.
Already in the autumn of 1965, the club started competing in rounds with two teams at the Leininger Hotel.
In the following years, the sport shooters, now organized into seven teams, established themselves in all classes up to the 1st Gauliga.
Club records were broken every year and the magic limit of 380 rings was first reached in 1980 by Rudi Meier.
As the performance of active shooters has increased, so have the membership figures.
After the club's "Leininger" clubhouse no longer met the requirements of a modern club of shooters, the then management, led by Johann Rinn, decided to create a future home in the cellars of the new "Landgasthof Härteis".
After 2700 hours of work, Father Strasser gave the church's blessing for the new shelter rooms on 8 May 1988.
One of the great highlights in the history of the club was certainly the 44th shooting, which coincided with the inauguration of the new guards flag in July 1991.
On 23 and 24 April 1994 the association celebrated its 30th anniversary.
In 1995 a group of Bollers was established.
Josef Schmalzl became the boilermaker.
A major challenge for the 'Böller' and for the association as a whole was the organisation of the Bavarian Böller Meeting in 2005.
In the past year, through many hours of volunteer work, the members of the association have modernized the rooms and the shooting facility at the Berngauer Hof, bringing it to the latest technology.
Eleven teams in round robin competition
The sporting performance of the club can also be seen.
A total of eleven teams are currently taking part in the rounds: six air rifle teams, one air pistol team, one sport pistol KK1, one youth and two AH teams.
The first team with Lars Ellrich, Katharina Ellrich, Steffi Grad and Kerstin Kellermann has been promoted from the Gauoberliga (highest league in the Schützengau ANB) to the District League 1 in the 2013/14 round.
The second team, which includes Verena Moosburg's Alexandra Meier, Eva Schuhmann and Tobias Graml, has moved up from the Gauliga Nord to the Gauoberliga.
In addition to shooting, events such as boxing, royalty and king's ball, club outings and Christmas celebrations are traditional.
The guards are also present at the parish and parish festivals.
Tony Stewart is in a car accident on his way back to the track.
Tony Stewart's return to the track ended about halfway through his race at the Atlanta Motor Speedway.
Stewart hit the wall for the second time after his right front tyre exploded in round 172 and ended his evening.
Stewart drove his damaged car into the garage and left without speaking to reporters.
His team manager, Chad Johnston, said his 14-man team was disappointed, but now he's focused on the race next weekend in Richmond, Virginia.
"I wish we had a better stint and a better outcome for him", Johnston said.
We're going to Richmond and hoping we can do better there.
Stewart was already driving a race on Sunday night after a collision with Kyle Busch into a wall and had to have the right side of his car repaired.
"I went in today with pretty good hopes for a good result", Johnston said, adding, "It just didn't work out".
Not long after the second accident, Stewart's car was loaded into the trailer and the team had packed up and ready to leave.
Stewart dropped three NASCAR Sprint Cup races after his car hit and killed another driver at an ashtray race in upstate New York.
He decided to come back this week and win either in Atlanta or the next race in Richmond to earn a spot in the chase.
He returned to his workplace while an investigation was underway into the tragic incident that led to the death of 20-year-old Kevin Ward Jr. who had stepped onto the track during a race to confront Stewart.
The authorities announced on Friday that the investigation into the cause of the accident will continue for at least two weeks.
There's still no decision on whether Stewart should be charged.
The three-time champion was met with great applause when he was introduced before the race.
After a start at 12th position, Stewart had advanced into the top 10 shortly thereafter, temporarily ranking fourth.
After a reboot in round 122, Busch was caught
Car with No. 18 out of control after exiting corner 2 and collided with Stewart, with both cars driving against the wall.
Stewart continued, but fell back to 21st place.
Searching for Dancing Youths
Laura, Lena, Lisa, Marie, Bettina, Emma and the director Lisa Neitzel (from left) are looking forward to their new teammates.
Like many other clubs, the jazz groups in the TV year are also creating full-time classes in the secondary schools.
After the summer holidays, some groups have declined sharply.
Now there is a growing demand for a sport that is healthy and enjoyable.
In the two jazz and modern dance groups of Lisa Neitzel, former dancer in the jazz and modern dance formation "Spirits", there are only nine children left.
"Three in the eight- to 12-year-old group, six in the 12- to 15-year-old group", the 20-year-old says.
With more actives, the whole thing would be much more fun, "you could dance completely different choreographies", she says.
If you want to dance, you can join the training class on Thursdays between 5 and 6 p.m. or on Friday between 5 and 6:30 p.m. in the dance gym at the former Meyer Hotel, Freistraße 9.
"The training begins regularly with a warm-up program", says the trainer.
Afterwards, various choreographies are practiced.
Jazz dance has the characteristic that there is no fixed form and is therefore open to many styles.
Elements from folklore to classical music to sports and acrobatics are processed in jazz dance.
Of course, company is not too short.
"We also go out to eat, watch dance movies, and we have stayed in the dance room", reports Lisa Neitzel.
In the group, you can make friends, share a beautiful hobby, and do a lot more for your own motor development.
If you don't like jazz, you can also get into one of the other TV shows.
Children and young people can join the classroom on Wednesdays in the areas of child dance/jazz, bambini ballet, video-clip dancing and hip hop.
The dance coach is Francisco Afonso.
Adult couples are welcome to dance on Monday and Wednesday nights.
Anyone who likes discofox, slow waltz, Vienna waltz, rumba, cha-cha-cha and tango can come by and join.
Bulgarian prison officials protest nationwide
Hundreds of prison staff from across Bulgaria have organized a nationwide protest outside the Ministry of Justice in the capital Sofia.
In the peaceful demonstration, they repeated their demands for the restoration of their old working conditions, which have recently been changed.
Higher wages are also on a list of demands to be discussed with the interim Minister of Justice, Hristo Ivanov.
Officials have been symbolically protesting the new working hours for a month and demanding a return to the previous 24-hour shifts.
Despite the meetings between the prison workers' union and representatives of the Ministry of Justice, no agreement was reached, the Bulgarian National Ratio (BNR) reported.
The negotiations are ongoing, the Director-General for the Implementation of Penal Measures, Rosen Zhelyazkov, told BNR.
The protest of prison workers is expected to be supported by members of the Union of Internal Affairs employees.
The Ukrainian army has abandoned Luhansk airport
In eastern Ukraine, pro-Russian fighters are still on the march.
After heavy fighting, allegedly involving Russian tank battalions, the Ukrainian army has abandoned the rebel stronghold Luhansk airport today, Monday.
The army also said that seven soldiers had been killed in the past 24 hours.
Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko had previously drawn personnel consequences from his army's heavy defeats in the fight against the separatists and announced changes in the top army leadership without giving details.
Prussian separatists shot down a plane
In the fight against Ukrainian government forces, pro-Russian separatists have, according to their own accounts, shot down one fighter jet and two military helicopters.
Some 100 soldiers were also wounded or killed in fighting in the Donetsk region, the insurgents said on Monday, according to Russian agencies.
The coast guard's ships are sunk
The insurgents also claimed to have sunk two Ukrainian coastguard ships in the Sea of Azov for the first time.
The Ukrainian border guard confirmed that two of its ships were shot down near the port city of Mariupol on Sunday.
Seven border guards were injured, a spokesman in Kiev told 112.ua.
Two crew members were reported missing.
Local media blamed Russia for the incident.
The separatists also reported having taken control of several villages in the Donetsk region.
Diplomatic Offensive in Minsk
The Ukrainian Contact Group is meeting today in Minsk, the capital of Belarus.
In addition to representatives from Ukraine, Russia and the OSCE, an envoy from the separatists from eastern Ukraine was to attend.
In advance, all actors used their appearances to make their demands public.
NATO does not want to break agreements with Russia
NATO will not break its agreement with Russia by deploying to Eastern Europe as a result of the Ukraine crisis.
NATO Secretary-General Anders Fogh Rasmussen said on Monday in Brussels that NATO was adhering to the 1997 NATO-Russia Council founding agreement.
The NATO chief, however, accused Russia of "a sharp breach" of the agreement.
"Today we have to face the reality that Russia does not consider NATO a partner", Rasmussen said.
Documents and statements from the Russian side indicate that they "consider us enemies".
The European Union is also a key player in the development of the European Union.
Rasmussen also announced his intention to strengthen NATO's presence in Eastern Europe.
A "Readiness Action Plan" to be adopted at the NATO summit in Wales will ensure that "we will have more visible NATO presence in the east as long as necessary", Rasmussen said in Brussels on Monday.
Kiev and Moscow agree to new gas talks
Russia and Ukraine have agreed to new talks to resolve their gas dispute, according to official information.
The negotiations are scheduled for next Saturday, Russian Energy Minister Alexander Nowak said on Monday.
The European Union is still waiting for a decision on whether to send a representative to the talks.
Because of the dispute over gas prices, Ukraine has been without fuel from Russia for weeks.
The EU's energy commissioner, Günther Oettinger, has recently mediated between the two sides.
Ukraine had warned that Russia could also cut off gas supplies to Europe.
Europe gets about a third of its natural gas from Russian sources, much of which flows through Ukraine.
Merkel speaks power: Tariff will be "fully clear"
Now the Chancellor is making her confession once again.
But it's not a release letter for all the complicated details.
The CDU's persistent concerns about the car tariffs have increasingly assailed the CSU.
Federal Chancellor Angela Merkel has spoken out against the introduction of a car tax after continuing opposition from her CDU.
"To be clear, it is in the coalition agreement and it will come", the party leader said after meetings of the CDU leaders in Berlin on Monday.
But Merkel has not yet decided on a detailed model.
The black and red government programme calls for 'certain parameters'.
The Federal Minister for Transport, Alexander Dobrindt (CSU), has 'made a proposal and it is now being worked on'.
The CDU, however, insists on its no to a flat-rate tariff on all roads.
The Commission's proposal for a directive on the protection of workers' rights and the protection of workers' rights in the Member States is a key element of the Commission's proposal for a directive on the protection of workers' rights and the protection of workers' rights.
In addition to this, he also discussed with Dobrindt other ways to raise more private capital for infrastructure investments, including broadband expansion.
"There's nothing special about it". Schäuble left a "Mirror" report uncommented on Sunday, his house testing its own concept to reward highway investors with customs revenue - after the 2017 election.
CSU President Horst Seehofer warned against developing tariffs against the prime minister in the cabinet.
The CDU's Federal Minister Armin Laschet confirmed his objections.
"The coalition agreement never intended to block all roads", said the CDU chairman in North Rhine-Westphalia.
In this respect, it is an important signal that Seehofer has now announced that he will speak again on the subject.
The CDU also opposes the plans from the Baden-Württemberg and Rhineland-Palatinate federations.
The background is fear that a tariff will affect small border traffic to neighbouring countries.
Seehofer had demanded coalition loyalty because of the tariffs criticism from the CDU.
The Left considers the plans a failure in the face of the dispute in the Union.
"The Murks tax is dead", said party leader Bernd Riexinger to the "New Osnabrücker Zeitung" (Monday).
"The minister fails with the toll". Dobrindt wants to introduce a vignette requirement on all German roads, which is to start in 2016.
However, the Coalition Treaty does not allow domestic car owners to be subject to additional burden.
They are therefore to receive full compensation for the toll through the vehicle tax.
However, under EU law, the model cannot disadvantage foreign drivers because of their nationality.
Genetic disorder often misdiagnosed
A British woman says she thought she would die as a result of a misdiagnosis over many years.
Karin Rodgers spent most of her youth believing that she had only a few years to live after being diagnosed with another disease.
She actually suffered from Charcot-Marie tooth disease (CMT), a group of inherited disorders that damage the nerves outside the brain and spinal cord.
Charity CMT UK reported that misdiagnosis is a common problem among people with CMT because so little is known about this disease.
Some 23,000 people in the United Kingdom are thought to suffer from CMT, which can lead to motor disorders such as muscle weakness, uncertain gait, and crooked toes.
Patients also suffer from feelings of numbness or pain, which is incurable and progressive, which means that the symptoms get worse over time.
When Rodgers was 13, she thought she was suffering from Friedreich Ataxia (FA) - a disease with very poor survival chances.
Rodgers thought she'd be in a wheelchair before she turned 18 and die before her 30th birthday.
The mother of two, now 51 years old, said: "As a child, I knew that I could not do the same as others.
I kept falling and everything took longer.
I never could ride a wheelchair or skateboard with the other kids, and I was often bullied at school because of my way of walking and walking.
Rodgers said that at the age of 13, after several operations to relieve her Achilles tendon and stretch her feet, she was looking at her medical records when her doctor left the room and read that she was suffering from FA.
"I felt guilty because I was curious, so I didn't tell anyone, but I went home, looked for the disease in the library, and wrote to the FA company", she said.
When I received the answer, I was shocked and panicked.
I thought I'd be in a wheelchair at 18, and die at 25, and slowly lose all my skills in the process.
I did all this by myself and planned my own funeral.
She said that when she turned 17, she realized that her abilities had not declined as much as she had imagined and consulted her doctor.
He just stood up and hugged me and said, "My love, I don't think you have that, or you'd be in a wheelchair by now".
I think you have something far less life-threatening.
After some genetic testing, she was diagnosed with CMT.
"When he explained to me what CMT was, I felt like I was a winner", she said.
Charity CMT UK has launched a CMT awareness month to raise awareness of this disease.
Staff field weaver a. D. Berni Diether has been working as a firefighter since the former training ground was closed
For almost ten years, the former military training ground in Münsingen has been closed to the public.
Nevertheless, every month deadly munitions are still appearing in the heart of the Swabian Alb biosphere.
The grenades are sometimes so dangerous that they have to be detonated on the spot.
An eardrum is heard during the explosions over the heart of the biosphere.
In December 2004, the last sharp gunfire was fired at the Münsingen military training ground, which was closed at the end of 2005 after 110 years of military operations.
Since then, the 6500 hectare area has been the core of the Schwabische Alb biosphere area, which is open to pedestrians and cyclists on 13 designated trails.
Tax burden on business people in the Washington area is increasing with the economic recovery
A recovery in the economy means more customers, more sales and new jobs.
It also means higher taxes.
State and local tax rulings for businesses in the country rose slightly last year, while the economic recovery accelerated, according to a newly published study last week, and businesses in the Washington area were no exception.
Companies in the District, Maryland, and Virginia combined to pay $27.6 billion to state and local agencies in fiscal year 2013, up 3.8 percent from revenue of $26.6 billion in 2012.
State and local corporate tax burden increased 4.3 percent to $671 billion last year, up from 3.9 percent a year earlier, and it was the third year in a row of growth after declining decisions in 2009 and 2010.
State taxes rose more than local taxes by 4.3 percent, according to the study, conducted by Ernst & Young, a tax policy group, and the Center for State Taxation.
More than half of the district's tax revenue, 56 percent, comes from corporate taxes, while 36 percent of Maryland's revenue comes from corporate.
Virginia has the lowest corporate tax revenue of 28 percent.
Much of the increase in tax revenue is driven by a recovery in corporate property values, the researchers say, which has led to a 3.7 percent increase in property taxes this year after three consecutive years of growth of less than 1 percent.
While a large part of these gains came from major states like California, New York and Texas, the flow seems to be the same for the Washington area.
Companies in the District, Maryland, and Virginia collectively paid more than $10 billion in state and local property taxes last year, up from $9.6 billion in 2012 - a year-on-year increase of 4.2 percent.
But the apparent recovery in property values is not as effective in increasing state and local tax revenue in Maryland, where property taxes account for just over a fifth of corporate tax decisions.
Companies in Virginia and D.C. pay almost half of their state and local taxes in the form of property taxes.
"What's happening in Maryland is that a large proportion of real estate, particularly in the tax-exempt D.C. area, is either owned by the government or by nonprofit organizations that don't pay property taxes", said Douglas Lindholm, executive director of the Center on State Taxation.
Maryland is therefore forced to rely much more on income taxes to provide the same services as other states.
The recent recovery in corporate tax revenue cannot be attributed to the recovery of the real estate market alone
Business revenue also appears to be recovering, according to the data.
Companies in the region reported income taxes on government organizations of $2.3 billion compared to $2.1 billion in 2012.
Maryland took in $1 billion in corporate income taxes, the highest in the region.
While the trend is moving in the same direction, the local tax burden for businesses is not increasing evenly in all three locations.
The growth rate in the district was 4.3 percent of the national average, while the increase in Maryland was significantly higher, 4.9 percent.
Virginia alone reported a below-average tax surplus of 4.1 percent.
Virginia has the lowest corporate income tax rates in all three jurisdictions (with 6 percent).
The corporate tax rate in Maryland is 8.25 percent and the district is relatively high at 9.975 percent.
A similar study by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce earlier this year showed that Virginia has lower state and local corporate taxes and a better overall tax climate than Maryland.
The study did not examine the district.
Despite the advantages, Virginia is under pressure from its southern neighbors.
North Carolina passed laws to lower its corporate tax rates this year from 6.9 percent to 6 percent, the same rate as Virginia, and the rate will drop to 5 percent next year.
If the state continues to meet its income targets next year, this law could reduce the state's corporate income tax rate to 3 percent by 2017.
Meanwhile, small businesses in the Washington area seem to be doing better, and they are paying more state and local taxes, according to the latest study.
Corporate taxes paid as personal income taxes by small business owners - a transitional structure that most small businesses are organized according to - in the District, Maryland and Virginia rose 20 percent last year to $2.4 billion, a significantly faster growth rate than corporate taxes overall.
The researchers say that the trend and increase in corporate taxes across the country are likely to continue this year, with the general VAT revenue for state and local governments increasing 6.2 percent in the first three quarters of 2014 compared to the same period last year.
The Commission has already decided to take a decision on the basis of the draft budget.
Partner city: German beer for Guangzhou
Hop and malt - a popular combination in China as well.
German beer enjoys an excellent reputation in China.
The partner city of Frankfurt in China now wants a brewery and also hopes for a direct flight link between the two cities.
German beer brewed in Frankfurt's partner city of Guangzhou - that is the urgent wish of the officials in China.
"We would be very happy if a German brewery settled in our city", said the deputy party secretary of the southern Chinese metropolis, Li Yiwei, this week while visiting an SPD delegation in his city.
Time and again, the official of the ruling Communist Party of China returned to this concern of the 12 million metropolises during the conversation.
Guangzhou, also known as Canton in Germany, is one of China's richest cities, Li said.
Therefore, people also have the purchasing power to afford German beer.
The Hessian SPD chairman Thorsten Schäfer-Gumbel, who led the German political delegation, told the host that he would be asking in Germany for a possible partner for the project.
"It doesn't take much for beer: good water, grain and joy", he added at lunch with the party leader in Guangzhou.
Mr Li already exuded this joy of life, he flattered the host.
The official from Guangzhou then came with sheep's clothing - but with red wine served for the meal.
The Chinese brand Tsingtao is based on German brewing.
Tsingtao beer is brewed according to German purity law.
More business
A second wish of the Chinese hosts would be a direct flight link between Frankfurt and Guangzhou, said Vice President Li.
Lufthansa had previously offered the flight but cancelled it in 2012 for economic reasons.
"It would be worth it again", the local politician was convinced.
"The trade between our two cities continues to grow".
Currently, travelers would have to take the bypass through Changsha in Hunan province, Li complained.
The administration of Guangdong Province, whose capital is Guangzhou, also hopes for the air connection.
The deputy governor of the province, Chen Yunxian, put this wish at the forefront of his conversation with the Social Democrats.
"This is a very good idea", replied Shepherd-Gumbel - Chinese Vice Minister Li Jinjun, a close acquaintance of Germany, nodded in agreement.
The Commission shall adopt a decision on the implementation of the measures.
The handsome vice-president of the Guangzhou party hopes to visit Frankfurt for a partnership meeting next year.
Li Yiwei was already in the main office, but not yet in this position.
He was elected to office only this year after his predecessor was removed from office on corruption charges.
The local party leader Wan Qinglian also had to leave.
The action against the Guangzhou officials is part of a nationwide campaign against corruption in the party and administration, which is being harshly enforced by President Xi Jinping.
The new top politician, Li Yiwei, had worked for an American company before his party career, which is highly unusual in the Chinese Communist Party.
Before taking office in Guangzhou, he was a senior official in Fujian, where the automaker VW is building a large plant.
Frankfurt has officially entered into more than a dozen city partnerships.
The connection to Guangzhou, which is 9,000 kilometers away, is one of those maintained by both sides, for example by a school exchange.
Last year, the 25th anniversary of the German-Chinese connection was celebrated.
The southern Chinese city on the Pearl River is almost as strong as Hesse.
The Commission's proposal for a directive on the protection of workers from the risks of the use of the Internet has been rejected.
Family of Joan Rivers "pressing the thumbs"
Joan Rivers has been unconscious since being admitted to a New York City hospital three days ago, but her daughter has expressed hope today that the 81-year-old comedian will recover from her illness.
"Thank you for your continued love and support", Melissa Rivers said in a statement today.
We're all thumbs up.
Sources said her mother was admitted to Mount Sinai Hospital on Thursday after an emergency cardiac arrest at a hospital on the Upper East Side, Yorkville Endoscopy.
Doctors deliberately keep them sedated and under close observation until they are more satisfied with their condition, which continues to be described as "serious".
The reactions came from many quarters, including overwhelming online support from Donald Trump, Montel Williams and Kelly Ripa.
Environmentally friendly vacuum cleaners and rising wages
In the future, stricter environmental standards will apply to cars and vacuum cleaners that are coming into the market.
Like refrigerators and washing machines, new vacuum cleaners will receive a label from 1 September on which the buyer can identify key data such as the energy efficiency of the device at a glance.
For new cars, the 'Euro 6' pollutant class has higher nitrogen oxide levels.
In addition, there is more money for the scaffolding workers: they receive a national minimum wage of 10.25 euros.
Amazon is buying Twitch for $1.04 billion
AMAZON just confirmed what Information reported Monday morning: The online retailer - and video producer, and a host of other things - is buying the video streaming service Twitch for $1.04 billion (US$970 million).
The announcement comes as a surprise, not because no one expected Twitch to take over, but because there was widespread speculation that YouTube would acquire the company.
Three months ago, it looked like the sale of Twitch to Google's video service was a cool one billion dollar deal, and the collaboration seemed natural.
Twitch, which was founded just three years ago as Justin.tv, had started as a general streaming service - a live version of YouTube.
Instead, it quickly became a platform for gamers who wanted to publish their favorite pieces in games, a "YouTube for live games", according to an insider.
The Twitch interface.
And "let's play", a video genre where the best-known players give the (mostly older) games a touch of mystery science theater, is already very popular on YouTube.
It's just that YouTube is often called Twitch when you want to describe Twitch, so the news that YouTube was buying Twitch was taken up with a bit of boredom, a textbook example of a well-established tech company buying a potential competitor.
It's a mystery why the deal with YouTube didn't work out, because the company was reportedly willing to pay as much as Amazon.
All we know about this right now is this statement from Emmet Shear, president of Twitch: "We chose Amazon because they believe in our community, they share our values and long-term vision, and they want to help us get there faster".
Another secret is, frankly, the incredible success of Twitch.
For snobs like me who declare that they prefer to play sports to watching, it's hard to understand the attraction of watching others play instead of taking control of the console themselves.
It's one thing to watch a friend at 3:00 in the morning sneak through Resident Evil, and it's another thing to watch a spinner get shot in the head 20 times in a row in Call of Duty.
You could watch all these games right now.
Another problem is that many of the most popular games today are ego games, so watching without your own control over the perspective can be a really good headache recipe.
I admit, the quick runs that Roger Bannisters run in our electronic age in record time are entertaining.
But as long as there's no gaming or humor virtuoso, his Twitch channel probably isn't that interesting.
But what do skeptics like me know about this?
Twitch is visited by 55 million people each month and is the fourth largest source of peak internet traffic.
And how exactly does Amazon want to make money from it?
It's hard to imagine Twitch being integrated into Amazon Instant Video as elegantly as YouTube could have swallowed Twitch.
But Twitch has something every company would love: thousands of young men being advertised as advertising customers.
As Twitch chairman Shear said, Amazon and Twitch "both believe in the future of gaming", and the medium shows no signs of shrinking, not even - swallowing - as a spectator sport.
There was a lot going on at the castle garden party on the hump.
The idea of the organizers was correct.
Despite heavy rainfall on Saturday night, an estimated 1,200 music fans attended the open-air festival in the castle garden.
The entrance had to be temporarily stopped.
"That was annoying", said Ron Sem, one of the organizers.
Salted with light and fun.
Maxim Sachraj and Ron Sem have formed the name Amula from two Spanish words.
Because the open air in the salt-water castle garden is supposed to emit brightness during the day and evening through various shows.
Well, the fun comes on its own anyway.
This was evident early on Saturday when the first visitors opened for the open air.
A celebration for all generations, the organizers had promised.
And they did.
Around the supply stalls on the castle garden meadow, salt-weedlers, but also guests from the nearby and wider area, had made themselves comfortable.
They followed the first live performances, whistled with their feet in the rhythm, enjoyed cool drinks - in short, pure relaxation and enjoyment were fashionable.
And that's been going on for generations.
While some were lurking on ceilings on the extra-curved white sand at the beach bar, others were grabbing a quarter of wine in the winery, the youngsters were stumbling on the hump fort, a major attraction for the smaller guests.
But even in child make-up, the volunteer helpers were literally working hard to become the master of the Andrang and to enchant imaginative creations in the little faces.
The older ones used the kickers or participated in a skateboard workshop run by the Goodfoot crew of salt wafers.
Until the big rain came.
Just before 5:30 p.m., he was pushing down on the visitors, especially families looking for the wide and dry.
But the attractiveness of the festival did not make this stop.
"More people came than expected", said Ron Sem, who spoke of "success across the board".
So there's no reason why the big party should be repeated next year.
Although the content and size of the event still needs to be worked out, Sem made it clear in an initial assessment to the popular vote on Sunday.
He said that the entrance had to be stopped.
Obviously, the security firm was hired with too few forces.
As a result, some who had already paid for the property were not allowed on the property.
The response was very good.
In a first careful estimate, the Salzwedan co-organizer spoke of about 1,200 visitors who roamed the castle garden.
There were problems with the sound system.
The Saltwater hip-hop band Blocks`n`Rox broke up their show with anger.
The technicians were unable to create a halfway reasonable sound.
The planned Shisha lounges could not be built because the tents could not be moved to Salt Bowl due to a tire panel.
"But next year they will be there", the organizer said.
The Amula Open Air premiere was more than successful.
And that's in bad weather.
However, the organisers made some mistakes which will be forgiven on the first edition but which need to be corrected on the second edition.
The social network Facebook also needs to be criticized by the organizers.
"Sorry, but for twelve euros you were just expecting more", says Melanie Meier on the event page.
"Unfortunately, you've taken a little bit of a stand", says Ele Zimmermann at the same time.
Others do not view the initial problems as being so close.
I think it's very good that some people not only talk stupidly, but they really try to get something on their feet.
"Hats off!" writes Stephanie Jenß to the Amula.
The organisers now have one year to draw up these critical points.
New Radom in Berkum: Watcherberg's landmarks shrink
This is not what we expected.
Rather, the ready component is waiting to be used in the striking building.
The action is in the context of a larger action: almost 50 years after the launch of the TIRA space radar, the shell, called radom, is being completely renovated.
The new Radom will be slightly smaller than the old one, with a diameter of 47.5 meters.
But the size still remains a world record.
The final step in completing the new shell is the change of the cap
The upper part of the old shell is cut off and removed with a crane.
After that, the last quarter of the new shell is placed.
If the weather is right, the action should be on stage earlier this week.
The contestant in the ice bucket challenge is drowning
Isabelle Roberts of Great Britain cried so loudly when ice water was poured over her head that she injured the bone structure of her face.
This ice bucket challenge went painfully by.
A woman was admitted to hospital after screaming so loudly at the Ice Bucket Challenge that she tore her jaw.
Isabelle Roberts of Great Britain cried so loudly when ice water was poured over her head that she injured her facial structure.
"The water was so cold that I cried, and while I did, my jaw just stayed standing", she told The Mirror.
Ice water is poured over the 20-year-olds.
Isabelle Roberts a few seconds before the accident
I tried to shut my mouth, but I couldn't, the jaw was hooked, and then I realized something was wrong.
My mother and sister saw this too, and they almost got their pants in for laughs, but I had to go to the ER.
The 20-year-old from the UK was admitted to hospital to have her jaw re-injected after taking part in the viral trend on Tuesday.
The clip has become an internet sensation and has been linked thousands of times on Facebook and Twitter.
Are the castle clubs going to be back on the line soon?
Last time, there was a constant dispute between the two Wolfrhauser Burgvereinen.
Now the board is considering a possible collaboration.
As a model for the reconstruction of the Wolfratshauser Castle, the late Richard Dimbath, former chairman of the Wolfratshauser Castle Friends, led the project in Guédelon, France.
A year ago, there was no good climate between the Castle Club and the Castle Friends.
The views on how to deal with the history of the Wolfrhaus castle and its possible reconstruction have been quite different.
The two camps are now moving towards each other: talks on a common approach are due to take place soon.
The association's board of directors, Torsten Sjöberg (Burgverein) and Herbert Piffl (Burgfreunde), confirmed this at the request of our newspaper.
"I called Mr Piffl and suggested that we could sit down", reports Sjöberg.
He believes that all members of both associations could be reunited in the future.
This is a way to achieve more rapidly visible results.
While the castle friends of the late Richard Dimbath had until recently been looking at the reconstruction of the castle on the mountain forest, the "excavation and experience" of the site is the main concern for the castle association around Sjöberg.
Herbert Piffl, vice-president of the Friends of the Castle, said he was very pleased to hear the call.
Since Dimbath's death, he's been in front of the castle friends.
A new chairman is to be found at a meeting of the members in mid-September.
The 74-year-old said the association currently has about 40 members.
"After the death of my friend Richard Dimbath, we first suspended the activities of the club out of respect", he said, "and this "thinking phase" was necessary to "consider how it could proceed".
According to Piffl, the new chairman will then go to the Castle Association.
Until then, the castle friends could also make a mood picture within their group.
There is no candidate for the presidency at the moment, says Piffl.
"But I'm sure someone will find himself". He doesn't want to run himself because he has his residence in Bad Tölz.
The new chairman should be a wolf house.
The woodworker wants to work on the project, but he is "very happy to continue to work with us".
The differences in viewpoints on reconstruction will likely continue in the near future.
He honors Dimbath as a "missionary" who always believed in rebuilding the castle.
Two similar, already advanced projects in Austria and France would show that this idea is not an airlock.
With a high participation of the population and volunteers from all over the world, it is a tourist magnet.
Piffl: "I was skeptical at first.
But over time, I have become more and more convinced that it makes sense to move the project forward".
There's nothing else here.
In addition, the project could be financed through EU grants, visitors' tickets and potential sponsors, Piffl believes.
"I personally don't want to throw the idea of reconstruction overboard". He hopes that the castle association may make a move at this point.
Their goal, first of all, is to document history, "which is important and good".
Then you could go on.
Clever Ways to Save on College Textbooks
Since the cost of college textbooks for many students is more than $1,000 a year, fast-second-second-second-second-second-second-second-second-second-second-second-second-second-second-second-second-second-second-second-second-second-second-second-second-second-second-second-second-second-second-second-second-second-second-second-second-second-second-second-second-second-second-second-second-second-second-second-second-second-second-second-second-second-second-second-second-second-second-second-second-second-second-second-second-second-second-second-second-second-second-second-second-second-second-second-second-second-second-second-second-second-second-second-second-second-second-second-second-second-second-second-second-second-second-second-second-second-second-second-second-second-second-second-second-second-second-second-second-second-second-second-second-second-second-second-se-second-se-se-second-se-se-second-se-se-second-se-second-se-se-se-se-se-se-se-se-se-se-se-se-se-se-se-se-se-se-se-se-se-se-se-se-se-se-se-se-se-se-se-se-se-se-se-se-se-se-se-se-se-se-se-se-se-se-se-se-se-se-se
He invented a loan system for books from high school students and offered a nominal compensation to delay the resale.
"My math book usually costs $180, but I got it for $10 for a semester and a chick-fil-a cookie", said Schroeder, 19, who attends Covenant College in Georgia.
He said the books he needed for his last semester cost him $430.
He spent $120.
The College Board said that students spend an average of more than $1,200 a year on textbooks and study materials, but that there were various cost-cutting options available to students.
Online stores and creative approaches like the Schroeders are increasingly the choice of choice for students.
Leasing textbooks is becoming more popular, and so students can use a book for a semester, often at a much cheaper price than when buying it.
Neebo Inc., which operates more than 250 university bookstores, reported that book rentals have doubled since 2011.
Industry surveys show that about a quarter of the books in college bookstores were rented last spring semester, Neebo's vice president, Tevor Meyer, said.
According to the National Association of College Stores, less than half of all textbooks are purchased in campus bookstores.
Here's the one-time deal.
Buy online
Some new books cost only a third of the price they're going to be in campus bookstores online.
The ninth edition of Calculus by Ron Larwon, Bruce Edwards and Robert Hostetler costs almost $290, but can be purchased from the specialized bookstore Chegg.com for $239.99.
Buy used
If you don't care about other people's notes or normal usage tracks, used books are a good option.
Calculus is needed on Chegg.com for $93.49.
Matt Casaday, 25, a graduate student at Brigham Young University, says he spent 42 cents on Amazon.com for a used edition of "Strategic Media Decisions: Understanding The Business End Of The Advertising Business".
The book was sold for $48.
Academics such as Ingrid Bracey, director of the University of Massachusetts at Amherst College Without Walls, recommended that students ask their professors if previous editions are allowed.
Sometimes the updates are not relevant to the seminar work.
In such cases, older expenses can often be purchased at a fraction of the cost of the latest issue.
In addition to Chegg and Amazon, eBay Inc.'s Half.com is a popular alternative to used books.
Rental
It is worth considering renting textbooks if you treat them well enough, if you think about returning them and if you do not want to keep them after you finish the course.
You can save more than 80 percent on the cost of a newly purchased book.
For example, a student could rent a "calculus" for a semester for about $20.
Please check the rules of the business you rent, including the fines for writing notes, highlights or use tracks.
If you don't return the book, the penalty fees may even exceed the price of a new book.
E-books
E-books are also an option instead of conventional textbooks.
In some cases, these books are leased de facto by providing an electronic license for a certain period of time from wholesalers such as Amazon.com, Chegg and Barnes & Noble Inc.
Chegg's a six-month lease on Calculus for about $61.
Bracey says that students in literature courses often find the best deals because many classics can be downloaded for free these days, while science and engineering textbooks can be very expensive.
I'm sure you'll be looking around.
Joe Gault, 29, who will soon attend Pepperdine Law School, recommends the ISBN number for book pricing, as you can be sure to find the right textbook.
And before you order online, you should check, Gault says, if the book is actually in stock.
He learned this lesson with hardship.
He bought a book that had four weeks to deliver and eventually paid the full price at the college bookstore.
Why Guardians of the Galaxy Wasn't a Box Office Hit
Sylvester Stallone's "The Expendables 3" grossed less than $30 million on its $90 million budget in the U.S., while "Sin City: A Dame to Kill For" only grossed $12 million on its $70 million budget.
Cameron Diaz's "Sex Tape" only made $14.6 million in its opening weekend, while children's films like "Dragon's Den Easy 2" are also disappointing at the box office.
An article by Telegraph film critic Robbie Collin suggests that the lack of quality in the films themselves may be the reason for the children's films.
Collin called 2014 "the worst year ever" for children's films and described "Dragon's Den Made Easy 2" as a purely "functional" fantasy sequel.
However, for films for a slightly older audience, it seems that the quality of the films is not necessarily the problem.
In July, Entertainment Weekly compared the average CinemaScore and Metacritic ratings for each summer movie launch shown on at least 2,000 screens between Memorial Day and July 20, 2013, and the current year.
The results are based on the opinion of film critics and film visitors and suggest that this year's film hits are equivalent to last year's.
Some commentators believe that the development is due to changing viewing habits and the growing popularity of web streaming services like Netflix.
Director Jon Favreau, who is currently working on Disney's upcoming Jungle Book movie, told the Hollywood Reporter website: "I think times are changing".
We must accept this and not try to go back in time.
In contrast to the currently poor box office performance of Hollywood productions, Netflix recently posted streaming content sales of $1.2 billion, almost double the previous year's $837 million.
Last summer, director Steven Spielberg criticized the film studios for focusing too much on filming comics and predicted a "core meltdown" of Hollywood.
In light of the current downturn, some commentators argue that his gloomy prophecy may well contain a true core.
However, due to the potential box office hits expected in the summer of 2015, including Avengers: Age of Ultron, Minions and Jurassic World, other film industry officials are more optimistic:
X-Men producer Simon Kinberg recently described the recent decline in box office receipts as simply "cyclical", telling Hollywood Reporters: "Next summer will be the biggest summer ever at the box office, and no one will worry about the business anymore".
When the second table tennis district class was abolished a few years ago to tighten the league division, this was a step in the right direction.
The German Table Tennis Association has now added an additional third Bundesliga to the programme.
The result: Those who did not ascend have descended.
Göttingen's top-flight team Torpedo, which has avoided relegation, will play only fifth in the upcoming season.
Torpedo ladies are still in fourth grade, despite their great run into the regional league.
The boys and girls of Torpedo start in the lower Saxony league, as do the boys of SC Weende.
SG Lengler and Torpedo Reserve are competing in the new Bundesliga, the Bundesliga is no longer represented by Göttinger clubs.
For the ladies, TTV Geismar plays in the Bundesliga, the Torpedo second in the Landesliga.
What looks like a better district class from the composition is now the new district superleague South.
The Commission has also decided to extend the period of validity of the agreement to the European Union.
In the regional league, Dransfeld and SC Weende play as regional representatives, in the regional league, TTC II, Red-Weiß, Bovender SV II and the teams of TTV Geismar II and III. The regional women's league starts at least in goal strength.
Güntersen, TTC and TTV Geismar II are here with us from the party.
In the district league, Torpedo III and Sattenhausen/Wöllmarshausen are starting.
With nine teams each
SC Weende is sending his girls to the Little League.
The SCW boys' district league season - where Torpedo II is still going - is not complete.
In a district class, Geismar, Tuspo Weende and Bovender SV are entering the season.
In the first season of the newly formed Regional League, the two Göttingen Circulars start with nine teams each.
The West season includes Red-White II, Bovender SV III, Laubach II, Torpedo IV and V, MTV Grone, Dransfelder SC II, Mielenhausen and SG Lenglern II.
The East Division consists of Sattenhausen/Wöllmarshausen, Nikolausberg and Landolfshausen.
The women's circuit league consists of Sattenhausen/Wöllmarshausen II, Bilshausen, Hemeln, Seulingen II, Tuspo Weende and the SG Rhume.
That's still better than in the Osterode Circle, where there are no more women's teams at the circuit level.
The newly-formed and controversial board will have to consider this, as none of the six second-class districts reaches its target.
NATO summit: first protests in Newport and Cardiff
There were protests by opponents of the NATO summit in Newport over the weekend.
On Saturday, hundreds gathered in downtown Newport for an anti-NATO march.
On Sunday, about 150 people gathered in Cardiff outside the city hall to hold a so-called counter summit.
Stephen Fairclough has been following developments over the weekend and speaking to protesters who have traveled to Belgium from Bridgend.
Teenagers from the Blue Mountains flew away
TWO young bushwalkers were taken to safety by rope after being trapped overnight in the Blue Mountains of NSW.
THE 16-year-old girl and the 19-year-old man set off for their tour shortly after Sunday afternoon at Govett's Leap in Blackheath.
Concerned relatives called the police at about 8 p.m. when the two did not return home.
A search party from local police and rescue services broke out and the couple was found around 11:00 p.m. near the Bridal Veil Falls.
The girl had injured her knee and the man had fallen and hit his head.
Rescuers stayed with the couple overnight, and they were flown out Monday morning.
You were transported to Blue Mountains Hospital in stable condition by ambulance.
Anti-government protests in Pakistan escalating
The 1,000 or so demonstrators were pushed out of the PTV building by soldiers, information minister Pervaiz Rashid said.
The station returned to broadcasting after about half an hour.
PTV director Athar Farooq said the strikers, armed with sticks, had damaged equipment in the editorial office.
No deaths or injuries were reported.
The protesters are demanding the resignation of the head of government, whom they accuse of electoral fraud.
Police said about a kilometer from Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif's residence, there were clashes between about 3,000 protesters and security forces on Monday.
According to the hospital, a policeman was injured.
At least three people were killed and more than 500 injured over the weekend when protesters tried to break into Sharif's residence.
They demand the resignation of the Prime Minister.
The powerful military had called for a political solution to the conflict "without wasting time and without using force" after a meeting at Army Headquarters on Sunday evening.
The statement added: "The army remains committed to its role in ensuring the security of the state".
The escalating violence has raised concerns about military intervention, which has been more frequent in the past.
The protests, led by opposition politician Imran Khan and preacher Tahirul Qadri, have been going on since Independence Day on August 14.
Sharif refuses to resign.
Khan and Qadri had called on their followers to wait.
"We will not go back without forcing Sharif to resign", Khan said.
Qadri made a similar statement.
Khan accuses Sharif of winning the parliamentary election in May last year by fraud.
Qadri demands the resignation of the central and provincial governments.
Then a transitional government should reform the electoral system and call new elections.
More than 40,000 security forces are deployed to protect the government quarter.
The protesters had initially held out peacefully in front of the parliament until Khan and Qadri called on them to storm Sharif's residence over the weekend.
Hütteldorfer is third in the table after his second win of the season.
With the 2:0 over Grödig, a bitter week on Sunday for Rapid came to a conciliatory end.
"The victory is very liberating", said coach Zoran Barisic, whose team had reached an intermediate stage with their Europa League finish on Thursday.
"The experience of success was incredibly important", confirmed captain and goalkeeper Steffen Hofmann, who came out in third place in green and white.
Schrammel-Traumtor brings Rapid to Siegerstraße Rapid has shown the right reaction to the disappointment against Helsinki with his second win of the season and is entering the country game break with a successful experience.
"We wanted to show a positive reaction", said outside defender Thomas Schrammel, who set the course for victory with his magnificent 16th-place lead volleyball in the 14th minute.
"I thought I'd just take all the frustration from Thursday and sneak it under the can", said the 26-year-old with a smile.
When Schrammel hit a Bundesliga game for the last time on 13 November 2010, it was still for Ried.
The first championship shot in a fast-going dress will therefore be a special memory for him.
"This is something very special for me, I'm from the Rapid Generation", said Schrammel.
Due to Mario Pavelic's short-term pelvic blows, Schrammel moved from left to right on the defensive side and did his thing very well there too.
He has enough experience to be able to exercise this position in a mirror.
He has earned the goal, he has already made some assists this year", Barisic said.
Team showing character Schrammel also delivered the flanker to 2:0 by Hofmann after well over an hour, which ultimately led to the decision.
Because before that, the guests could have written.
"Thank God we were lucky today", said Schrammel, referring to the breakdown in performance and results over the past few weeks. "The results have not been good, but the game was always good compared to last year".
Barisic even found that they had been "better than they are today in many games before" - against "the strongest team to play in this stadium this season".
The first three points since 26 July have therefore proved that the team's behaviour is intact despite the setbacks: "Today my team has shown that it has character".
He's no less pleased that we've finally played to zero.
The fact that Brian Behrendt, Mario Pavelic, Christopher Dibon, Deni Alar and Michael Schimpelsberger have been involved in several failures and that Srdjan Grahovac, Stefan Stangl and Philipp Schobesberger made their debuts makes the win even more valuable.
"You must not forget that", warned Barisic, who has lost in the last three days to Behrendt and Pavelic players who have been very stable lately.
The country break must therefore be used to "lick wounds and add a little bit of body weight", explained Barisic, who has five U21 selectors in his ranks.
One of the people who's most likely to be in a position to take a break is Captain Hofmann.
He's tearing himself apart for the team, going over it in pain.
He has shown that he is a very important player for us, especially in this difficult period", Barisic said.
Hofmann not only gave the Rapids the structure but also scored the second goal before his substitution in the 68th minute.
For the 33-year-old, who completed his 350th Bundesliga game, it was the first hit out of the game since 2 November 2013 (4:2 over Admira).
Hofmann: "We mustn't think that everything is fine now". "We've certainly had a little luck, but eventually, luck must come back to us.
Now it was time", Hofmann said.
He did, however, warn of concentrated work: "You can't always see this in black and white.
We haven't played as badly as this has been portrayed in recent weeks.
But we mustn't believe that everything is fine now.
He couldn't deny the importance of his role for the team.
It's a very young team, and I can help a lot right now.
They stick to me at certain stages", Hofmann said.
Grödig-coach Michael Baur had little to blame for himself and his team.
He regretted the quick counter-offensive "from the category of magic gate", as well as the regular goal of Nutz in the 40th minute, which had been unjustly denied by referee Kollegger.
The only charge I can make to the team is that we weren't specific enough towards goal at some points.
We had too few degrees.
Interior defender Maximilian Karner said: "It started badly, but we got in and even made a goal.
I mean, there's more to it than that.

We showed a powerful tribe on our summer show "My Piece of Rhône's Happiness" last Friday.
Several of these giants still exist in the county, the exemplar pictured is the "quiet" above Unterweißenbrunn.
A steep footpath leads up to the 600-year-old oak.
It passes through cords, basalt piles and basalt stones.
A little bit below the quarry from Bauersberg, a kilometer north of the road to Weisbach, there it stands.
The natural monument is vitally impressive, extending beyond the surrounding trees and resembling an American mammoth tree with a diameter of over eight meters.
A small Buddha on a tree trunk suggests that it is a spiritual or mystical place.
But despite intense research, there was only evidence of the origin of the name.
Dr. Wolfgang Schneider has consulted the archives of the Bishop's House and interviewed older people from Underwhite Well to find out what the problem is with the vengeance.
The result of his research was the rather sober explanation for the name.
Thus, up to about 80 years ago, goat herders are said to have driven their animals from underground wells to the hard-rooted, stone-free meadows.
At the foot of the tree, the weary herdsmen are said to have rested.
In the meantime, the area has regained its importance, as the meadows are actually grazing goat herds again.
The area has also been declared the core zone of the biosphere reserve, Schneider further found out.
However, caution should be exercised when entering the stone collections, as the sun-warmed basalt is also a popular place for crusaders.
A hiking trail leads from Underwhite Fountain to the tree, but it's somewhat hidden.
Other roads are marked to climb up towards Hochhrön and invite for an extensive hike.
Where's the water fort?
However, a water tower that we will look for in our next assignment is rarely found at the height.
The reflection in the ditch gives a good impression of the building, but we have some historic buildings in the county that the building conference might fit.

After weeks of fighting, Italy's Prime Minister and acting EU President, Matteo Renzi, has, against strong conservative opposition at the EU summit last week, upheld the nomination of his foreign minister, Federica Mogherini, as EU foreign policy chief, to succeed Britain's Catherine Ashton.
Renzi, as reported by the government-owned daily La Repubblica, sees the appeal of his favourite Mogherini, who is also in the government team, as strengthening the position of the Social Democrats and his own in the EU.
He also expects this to boost his reform package in Italy.
Last but not least, Renzi hopes to calm the left-wing party base which has repeatedly opposed him, because Mogherini is associated with it - albeit in a more moderate way.
The Commission has already decided to take a decision on the proposal for a directive on the protection of the environment and the environment.
The EU's chief diplomat will also be the Commission President's deputy.
The approval of the EU Parliament is still pending.
Otherwise, President Giorgio Napolitano would hardly have called the nomination of the 41-year-old politician from the ruling Democratic Party (PD) an "important recognition" of Italy's role in the EU.
La Repubblica is optimistic that Mogherini, who has held senior party positions for nearly two decades and is known for her ambition, will face the "enormous challenges".
The Roman woman of birth is married and has two daughters.
She began her political career in 1996 as a political scientist in the youth organisation of the then Democratici di Sinistra (Left Democrats), which merged with the Catholic centre-left party Margherita in 2008 to form the current Social Democratic Party.
In 1999, Mogherini became Vice-President of the European Community Organisation of Socialist Youth for three years.
In 2001, she was elected to the Left Democrats' Party Council and entered high-level party politics, working in the Foreign Policy Department, of which she soon became head.
It was known for its traditional focus on Italian foreign policy, such as the Middle East, for its studies of NATO deployment in Afghanistan, where Italy is involved with a contingent of troops, and for its contacts with the Social Democrats in Europe and the Democrats in the United States.
She has been a member of the Chamber of Deputies since 2008, where she is an expert on defence and European and international affairs.
When Renzi became Prime Minister in February 2014, he summoned Mogherini to his foreign minister.
If the PD is again in a better position today with the strong peace movement in the country, which contributed to the party's over 40 percent of votes in the EU elections in May, then Federica Mogherini has, as is noted in PD circles, a share.
The talks in Brussels, where the new EU foreign minister has too little diplomatic experience, so there is a lack of substance, are being contested in the PD.
In Brussels, particularly in Poland and the Baltic countries, Mogherini's realistic statements on the crisis in Ukraine are being mistrustfully prosecuted and denounced as a "friendly Russia" course.
It supports the South Stream pipeline, operated by the Russian company Gasprom, which is to transport Russian natural gas directly to southern Europe bypassing Ukraine, which also serves Italy's energy security.
After Renzi took office as EU President in July, Mogherini travelled to Moscow for her first state visit.
The photos of Putin shaking hands were taken in Brussels with outrage, as well as inviting the Kremlin chief to a Milan economic summit in October.
A total of nine young people started their training at emz-Hanauer in Nabburg on Monday.
Among them is an Azubi who has previously completed another training in the company.
In the future, the new staff will be employed in four training professions: electronics (three trainees), mechatronics (two), tool mechanics (two) and process mechanics (two).
All the Azubis come from the district of Schwandorf: Tobias Braun and Thomas Bücherl from Schwarzach, Stefan Brickl and Florian Rewitzer from Schmidgaden, Johannes Beer from Neunburg vor Wald, Felix Domaier from Oberviechtach, Daniel Sorgenfrei and Sebastian Zahner from Pfreimd and Ferdinand Strebl from Teunz.
The new trainees have previously attended primary and secondary schools and schools.
From Wednesday to Friday, trainees of all ages and trainers will travel to Oberammergau for a team-building event, where a full-day hike and rafting at the inn are included.
The company employs 435 people in Germany and 950 worldwide.
The number of trainees spread over all years is 27.
The socialists in France should "shut up and make France right", said Francois Hollande's most important ally.
Mr Valls called on the deeply divided left to show 'their love' for the controversial socialist president, whose cabinet formation has been disapproved by the vast majority of French people.
The president deserves everyone's respect, he deserves our loyalty, he deserves our support.
"It is our duty to stand by him", he said with a loud applause.
In a grievous gesture, the Prime Minister insisted that his government would not challenge the controversial 35-hour week in France despite strong demands for easing the regime by Emmanuel Macron, the new Minister of Economy.
On Saturday, Mr Hollande urged his fellow Socialists to show 'unity' with the government.
But Christiane Taubira, the justice minister, threw sand in the gear when she appeared at a meeting of dissented socialist MPs and criticized the Socialist Party for taking the French "faith in their future".
Marine Le Pen, the far-right leader of the National Front, mocked the socialists' constant digging and said she could not imagine the new Valls government lasting more than a few months.
Francois Hollande is the Emperor without clothes, but Prince Manuel Valls has none, they are forced to form a new government if the old one hasn't even survived a summer.
"And the new ones will not survive the autumn or winter either", Ms Le Pen told supporters.
She repeated her party's call for the dissolution of Parliament, saying she was confident of emerging victorious in early elections and was ready to take over the government.
France's ruling party suffered a defeat in the local elections in March and the right-wing National Front took the lead in the EU elections in May.
A survey in the Sunday newspaper Journal du Dimanche found that 76 percent of French people believe that the Socialist Party is in danger of falling apart into several rival factions before the end of Hollande's 2017 term.
Pascal Perrineau, a political scientist at Sciences Po University, warned that the French would quickly lose their patience if the new socialist government did not improve the economy and record unemployment rates.
"There is a small window of opportunity, but public opinion must quickly feel that things are changing", he warned.
Otherwise, the situation could worsen.
Norwegian Cruise is about to make a deal with Prestige Cruises worth $3 billion
Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd NCHL.O, the world's third largest cruise line operator, is conducting advanced negotiations to acquire competitor Prestige Cruises International Inc. for approximately $3 billion, according to industry experts.
A deal would give Norwegian Cruise, a company with a market value of $6.8 billion, access to Prestige Cruises' luxury cruise ships and its wealthy clientele, while competing with larger rivals such as Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd (RCL.N) and Carnival Corp (CCL.N).
A deal could be announced this week, the sources said on Sunday, warning that talks could end in vain.
The owner of Prestige Cruises, private equity firm Apollo Global Management LLC (APO.N), also owns a 20 percent stake in Norwegian Cruise.
The sources asked to remain anonymous as the negotiations were not public.
Representatives from Norwegian Cruise and Prestige Cruises declined to respond to requests for comment, while a spokesman for Apollo declined to comment.
The Miami-based Norwegian Cruise operates 13 cruise ships on routes between North America, the Mediterranean, the Baltic, Central America and the Caribbean.
Its revenue in 2013 was $2.57 billion, up 13 percent from 2012.
Prestige Cruises, also based in Miami, operates under the brand names Oceania and Regent, which together operate eight cruise ships on routes to Scandinavia, Russia, the Mediterranean, North America, Asia, Africa and South America.
It reported revenue of $1.2 billion for 2013, up 6 percent from the previous year.
The cruise industry is worth a total of about $29 billion and is expected to grow in the coming years as the middle class strengthens in emerging markets such as China and India.
The companies are trying to position themselves as the best choice among cruise operators for these new customers.
The Commission also examined whether the Commission had any doubts as to whether the Commission had considered the measures necessary to comply with the conditions laid down in Article 107 (1) TFEU.
Apollo has been the majority shareholder in the company since a $850 million deal in 2007.
Norwegian Cruise was formed in its current form in 2000 by merging with a cruise line operator owned by Genting Bhd (GENT.KL), a leisure and casino group controlled by Malaysian billionaire Lim Kok Thay.
Apollo invested $1 billion in Norwegian Cruise in 2008.
Norwegian Cruise went public in January 2013.
Genting held 28 percent of the shares, Apollo 20 percent of the shares and private equity firm TPG Capital LP, according to licensing authorities, at the end of June.
Carnival, Royal Caribbean Cruises and Norwegian Cruise jointly own over 82 percent of the passenger capacity of American cruise ships, according to the original application documents for the listing of Prestige Cruises.
Pro-Hong Kong activists condemn China the day after the election.
A group of Beijing loyalists waved the Chinese flag nearby.
The Standing Committee of the National People's Congress on Sunday passed a framework law that allows only two or three candidates for leadership in Hong Kong in 2017.
All candidates must first obtain the majority support of a nominating committee, which is expected to be composed of members who are loyal to Beijing.
This decision makes it almost impossible for opposition Democrats to be allowed to vote and has caused pro-democracy activists to realize their threat and paralyze the financial centre of Hong Kong with "Occupy Central" protests.
Political reforms have long been a controversial topic in Hong Kong; and China's party leadership fears that the call for democracy will spread to other cities.
Following the publication of a Beijing White Paper in June exposing China's dominance over Hong Kong, democracy activists held an unofficial referendum on the electoral process in the Special Administrative Region, in which hundreds of thousands marched into the city's business district and held a sit-in.
The interview is being organised by the Hong Kong government and the Chinese Liaison Office in Hong Kong.
The Deputy Chairman of the Standing Committee's Legal Committee, Zhang Rongshun, and the Deputy Director of the Office for Hong Kong and Macau Affairs of the State Council, Feng Wei, should be interviewed during the day.
Student activists announced that they would gather in the afternoon outside the office of the head of government in Hong Kong.
Britain did not see any democratic elements in Hong Kong until the final phase of the 150-year colonial government.
Putin demands that Kiev hold "state talks" with eastern Ukraine
Russian President Vladimir Putin demanded, according to Russian media reports, on Sunday that the Ukrainian government stop fighting separatists in the east of the country and immediately begin negotiations on the "stateship" of the secularized region.
His spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, later clarified that Putin did not mean that the separatist-controlled territory of eastern Ukraine would become part of Russia, but that its status with respect to Ukraine would need to be redefined to give the Russian-speaking region the power to represent its rights and interests.
Putin's call for equal negotiations with the pro-Russian insurgents in Kiev, however, is in line with the strategy he has apparently pursued since the start of the unrest five months ago: aid to the separatists in the occupation of territory and pressure on the Ukrainian government to allow the newly proclaimed region of Novorossiya to achieve real independence by an alliance with Russia rather than the West.
In an interview with state television channel Channel One, Putin condemned the Ukrainian military campaign to recapture separatist-held territories in the eastern Donetsk and Luhansk regions, which were seized in March and April after Moscow annexed the Ukrainian peninsula of Crimea on March 18.
The Kremlin and the separatists have recently called the captured territory "Novorossiya" or "Neurussia", a term that recalls the pre-revolutionary glory days of the Russian Empire.
Putin pointed out that all those who hope for soon-to-be peace talks are "caught in their illusions" as Ukrainian politicians campaign for the 26 October election and as government groups attack civilian communities in separatist-held areas, Itar-Tass reported.
"We must immediately enter into detailed discussions, not only on technical issues, but also on the political organization of society and the state status of southeastern Ukraine, in order to safeguard the interests of the people living there", he said.
Peskov said Putin's reference to statehood must be seen in the context of greater autonomy, which has been discussed for months by the Kiev leadership, to spread fears in Russian-speaking areas that their cultural and linguistic rights are under threat.
Only the Ukrainian government can grant the eastern territories the necessary autonomy, Peskov said.
This is not a matter of negotiations between Ukraine and Russia, Peskov said, "because it is not a conflict between Russia and Ukraine, but an internal conflict in Ukraine".
The Kremlin spokesman's clarification of the "misinterpretation" of Putin's remarks underlined Russia's leadership in dealing with the separatist rebellion in the east, as opposed to the direct annexation of Crimea, where the majority of its 2 million inhabitants are ethnic Russians.
Moscow would have far greater difficulties annexing the Donetsk and Luhansk regions in eastern Ukraine, as most of the 6.5 million inhabitants are not Russians and pre-conflict surveys have shown a broad majority for remaining in Ukraine.
The autonomy, which Russian diplomats have discussed in international forums, would give the regional governments in Ukraine the power to negotiate their own trade agreements and foreign relations, thus giving the Kremlin de facto control over a territory that connects the Russian territory with Crimea.
The peninsula in the Black Sea, annexed five months ago, is home to most of the Russian Navy, as well as an important commercial port and historic coastal region.
The regions between the Russian Rostov region and Crimea are also rich in mines, factories and foundries that produce important components for the Russian military.
In his inauguration speech on 7 June, Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko proposed that, following new elections, Ukrainian legislation should consider constitutional amendments to give the territories greater control over their finances and the status of languages.
But his idea of autonomy seems to be in sharp contrast to those of the Kremlin and the separatist rebels whose arming and incitement is accused of Moscow.
Putin's last call to Kiev to negotiate with the separatist leaders on equal terms followed a further advance by the rebels last week after Russian troops and tanks entered eastern Ukraine via the previously peaceful region along the Sea of Azov.
The Russian-backed separatists took control of Novosovsk in a gesture that Ukrainian security officials fear is the first step in a campaign to take over the strategic coastal region as far as Crimea.
For this reason, massive civil and military preparations have been launched to secure Mariupol, a 500,000-strong steel port located between Novosovsk and the narrow access to the Crimean peninsula.
Poroshenko spoke at a meeting of EU leaders in Brussels on Saturday, urging action to prevent further Russian aggression against Ukraine, a former Soviet republic that has been independent for 23 years.
"We are close to a point of no return", Poroshenko warned.
Thousands of foreign troops and hundreds of foreign tanks are now on the territory of Ukraine.
The EU summit did not decide on any concrete action, and the leadership demanded the drafting of further sanctions against Russia to take effect in the event of an unspecified escalation of the Ukrainian crisis.
Ukrainian soldiers were forced to withdraw from their positions in Ilowaisk after two Russian tank columns and 1,000 soldiers invaded the Donetsk region last week to support the besieged separatists, Colonel Andriy Lysenko, spokesman for the Ukrainian National Security and Defense Council, said in Reports on Saturday in Kiev.
The first 63 Ukrainian soldiers, believed to have been captured by the Russian invasion of Ilowaisk, were replaced on Sunday by 10 Russian paratroopers captured a week ago on Ukrainian territory, Lysenko said on Sunday.
Naked photo scandal about Australian celebrity and Gabi Grecko
Geoffrey Edelsten has not hidden his anger over hackers who allegedly stole nude photos of his fiancée Gabi Grecko and a Who's Who of Hollywood's A-Promis.
The film community is in a state of excitement after a series of clear photos of naked Jennifer Lawrence in a hacking scandal surrounding celebrities surfaced online.
The hacker responsible for this has 60 nude photos of Lawrence, star of "The Tribute of Panem" and superstars, including models Kate Upton and Cara Delevingne, singers Rihanna, Ariana Grande and Lea Michelle, and actress Kirsten Dunst.
Australian actresses Teresa Palmer, Emily Browning, Yvonne Strahovski, and Grecko from Melbourne were also reportedly made public with private photos due to an iCloud gap.
There are 101 celebrities on the list.
The nobleman who got engaged to Grecko last month told Confidential, "It's disgusting".
All private letters and pictures should remain private.
It's a shame that private information can be stolen and passed on to others.
Grecko, currently in New York, reportedly told a news website that the hack was "disgraceful" and that the victims "felt hurt".
The hacker has allegedly 30 pictures of Palmer with her ex-boyfriend Scott Speedman, including two footage of her lying upstairs in a pool without a camera.
Palmer's films include Love Is Invincible with Liam Hemsworth.
Palmer, Chuck-Star Strahovski and actress Browning from Sucker Punch were unavailable yesterday for comment on the hacked images.
A Lawrence representative told TMZ, "It's a disgusting violation of privacy".
Actor Seth Rogen condemned the hacker in his tweet: "Posting hacked images from a cell phone is nothing more than selling scrapware".
Purely legal, the distribution of stolen images should not be tolerated.
Cyclists, joggers and walkers were present at the 8th cycle on the Great Feldberg yesterday, supporting the association "Help for Children with Cancer".
The tour, which was torture for some, was a light exercise for others.
But one thing everyone agreed on was that it was fun.
Thomas Studanski must have slept well last night.
For the first time in his life, the head of the Upper Class Brauhaus rode his bike up the Feldberg yesterday.
For the good cause.
He can easily put a little muscle pain away, especially since he personally learned valuable things from riding the eighth cycle on the Great Feldberg for the benefit of the "Help for Children with Cancer" (Frankfurt).
It's a great thing.
"I know I can do this now - fine!"
A little puppy on the way to the applause curve?
No, if I had stopped once, it would have been...
Like Thomas Studanski, who is a member of the CDU in the Upper Rural Parliament, many of the 718 participants were tormented by mountains yesterday in the early morning hours and arrived near exhaustion but happy on the plateau.
Others, on the other hand, found it easier to cross the 11 km-long distance between Hohemark and Feldberg.
Norman Dießner, for example.
The all-red Green politician from the Circle Day - red dress, red bike - made an understatement at the start ("Every lot of professionals, there's arrival!"), but then turned out to be half-professional on the mountain and went through the goal after 45 minutes without breathing.
He also made the route in a slide, as did Nina Kuhn, a spokeswoman for Oberursel City who had set out with Frank Grüneisen.
For the two triathletes, the field-berg cycling was not necessarily a sporting challenge: "This is about charity, we're happy to be involved - we would have made an outing today anyway", Kuhn said.
On the way, they met Paul Wenzel of Oberreifenberg.
The boy (12) had gone down to Oberursel in the morning to step back up.
The Frankfurter Florian Zierz had swung into the saddle at home at 9 a.m., "turned" the field mountain twice, and then rolled home with fun.
I also had a good time with "Fritten Toni".
For the head of the Upper East Side cult kiosk, bike tours of the Feldberg are just one of them.
He had been aiming for 40 minutes on his 6-pound race bike.
It was a crazy event.
For this purpose - I am happy to be there", said Andreas Balzke.
The well-trained Mainzman describes himself as an "ambitious racing cyclist".
He must be, because he was riding the Fixie wheel, which is racing wheels, but without a circuit...
The fact that the mountain was smoothly climbing without a wheel was proved not only by the 20 hikers who climbed the White Wall and the fox dance to the summit, but also by a jogger who carried a weighted car tire on a rope.
Professor Volker Lischke, a mountain doctor who worked with his team to ensure safety, said: "I know this one from Frankfurt, who is training for a special sled training, only that he pulls the sled himself".
The 718 participants - and thus as many as ever - had been sent to the track in groups this morning.
The walkers first at 9:30.
The first cyclists and runners followed at 10:00.
Five minutes later, the first mountain bikers started.
Bent Hansen, chairman of the Association "Riding on the Great Field Mountain", gave the launch commands and wished the participants a good trip.
He hopes that next year the track will be closed to the top of the Feldberg for the safety of the participants.
