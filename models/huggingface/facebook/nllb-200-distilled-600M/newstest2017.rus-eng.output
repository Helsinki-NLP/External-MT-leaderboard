28-year-old chef found dead in a San Francisco mall
A 28-year-old chef who recently moved to San Francisco was found dead in a stairwell at a local mall this week.
However, the victim's brother says that he cannot imagine anyone wanting to hurt him, noting: "Finally things worked out for him".
The body found at Westfield Mall Wednesday morning was identified as a 28-year-old San Francisco resident, Frank Garcia, the San Francisco Medical Examiner's Office said.
The San Francisco Police Department reports that the death was classified as a homicide and the investigation is ongoing.
Victim's brother, Luis Garcia, told ABC's KGO in San Francisco that Frank, a former Boston delivery line chef, got his dream job as a chef at San Francisco's Sons & Daughters six months ago.
A Sons & Daughters spokesman said they were "shocked and repressed" by his death.
"We are a small team that works as a family and will be greatly missed", the spokesman said.
Our thoughts and condolences to Frank's family and friends during this difficult time.
Luis Galicia said that Frank was staying at the hostels at first, but recently "he was finally getting along".
"He found an apartment, he was dating a girl", Luis Galicia told KGO.
Luis Galicia said he couldn't imagine anyone who wanted to hurt his younger brother.
He had a good soul and a big heart.
His way of communicating with his family was always to cook us some dishes, to cook us dinner", said Luis Galicia.
He never wanted to be involved in any quarrel.
He was a brother who swam the stream.
"For all the bad things that are happening to this world, it was that boundless diamond that shone brightly every day", he said.
Anyone with information is requested to call the SFPD Hotline at 415-575-4444.
Churkin said the UN Security Council meeting on Crimea was helpful.
The permanent representative of Russia at the UN Vitaly Churkin said that the last meeting of the UN Security Council on Crimea was useful, Interfax reports.
"I think the discussion was helpful for us, and we gave them information about what happened", Churkin said.
He explained that at the closed consultations of the Security Council he presented the member states with information about incidents on the territory of the Republic of Crimea and read the statement of the Russian Foreign Ministry, in which "he expressed concern and outrage over the attempted terrorism and sabotage on the territory of the Republic of Crimea".

Italy's debt has risen to record highs
Italy's public debt in June 2016 was more than 2,248 trillion euros.
The central bank of the country said that this amount is the historic maximum, reports RIA Novosti.
The previous negative record was set in May of this year.
At that time, the government debt amounted to 2.228 trillion euros.
It is noted that in the first half of the year Italy's debt burden increased by 77.2 billion euros.
Earlier, it was reported that at the end of 2015, Italy's public debt was 132.7% of the country's GDP.
Meanwhile, Italian Economy and Finance Minister Pierre Carlo Padovan predicted this figure would drop to 130.9% in 2016 and 123.4% of GDP in 2018.
141 victims of the Domodedovo attack received payments from the airport.
141 people received charitable payments from the "Aviationny" fund, which was created by the management of Domodedovo airport to help the victims of the terrorist attack in 2011, Interfax reports.
According to the press secretary of the airport, Alexander Vlasov, two other applications are currently under consideration.
"Fund continues to provide charitable payments to victims of the 2011 terrorist attack and is providing all-round assistance to solve existing issues", Vlasov added, recalling that a website of the fund was created to facilitate the interaction with the victims, which contains full information on the procedure for providing charitable assistance.
In 2011, the death row homicide victim Domodedovo set off an explosive device in the flight hall of foreign airlines.
The attack killed 37 people and injured 172.
Scientists have found an animal that can live 500 years
An international team of biologists has concluded that the longest-lived vertebrate animal is the Greenland polar shark, which can live for about 500 years, reports RT.
Scientists have conducted a radiocarbon analysis of the crystal of the eye of 28 Greenland sharks.
The largest shark, measuring over five metres in length, can be anywhere from 272 to 512 years old.
Biologists believe that a shark's low metabolism plays an important role in its longevity, leading to slow development.
Greenland shark females reach sexual maturity at 150 years of age.
It was previously thought that the Greenland whale, the shark's "neighbor", lived longer than any vertebrate.
The oldest known person was a little over 210 years old.
Putin changed the composition of the Russian Security Council.
Russian President Vladimir Putin has made changes to the Security Council of the Russian Federation by his decree, the Kremlin press service reported.
Earlier it was known that Putin removed the head of the administration of the president Sergey Ivanov, his successor was appointed Anton Waino.
Ivanov will now serve as the president's special representative on environmental, environmental and transportation issues.
The Deputy of the Council Rashid Nurgaliyev was excluded from the list of permanent members of the Russian Security Council.
The council includes Sergei Ivanov, Anton Waino, Sergei Menaylo, full-time president of the SFO, and Nikolai Tsukanov, full-time president of the SFO.
Sergei Ivanov is released from the office of head of the presidential administration.
By the decree of the President Sergei Ivanov was released from the post of head of the Kremlin administration.
Ivanov is appointed as the special representative of the Russian Federation for environmental protection, ecology and transport.
Anton Waino, former Deputy Sergei Ivanov, was appointed as the new head of the administration.
According to Vladimir Putin, Ivanov himself asked him to transfer to another job.
Should I go to the sanatorium if I'm not sick?
Our expert is the chief physician of the Olga Bogush Sanatorium.
If a person is healthy and just tired of work, should he go to the sanatorium?
We need rest in a spa not only for treatment but also for disease prevention.
In a sanatorium, a person can check his or her body condition and receive a doctor's recommendation on how to live so that his or her health does not deteriorate.
Such recommendations will not be of any use to anyone.
"Just tired of work" is an important signal to the body, and you shouldn't give it up.
Constant stress, mental and physical exhaustion can lead to depression and chronic fatigue syndrome.
And about 90 percent of visitors experience stress.
And the most vulnerable are people in big cities between the ages of 45 and 55.
So it's best to make things easy and get some rest in time.
Studies show that 98% of people lower their biological age during their stay in a sanatorium.
Modern sanatoriums offer comfortable rest for the whole family.
So if you want to spend your vacation with your kids, you don't have to leave them.
Children, even the youngest, are provided with health programs that include diagnostic services, pediatric consultations, tests, and treatment.
For example, swimming (many sanatoriums have children's swimming pools), inhalation, special diet, massages, oxygen cocktails, and healing physical training.
The course of the procedure is determined by the doctor taking into account the individual indications and characteristics of the growing organism.
In addition, children's clubs with animators are usually operated in the sanatoriums, where children can attend play lessons, various master classes.
Some sanatoriums open their doors even to guests with babies, provide the baby nurses with the necessary conditions and provide the services of an experienced nanny.
The mild winter, the long summer, the abundance of sunny days a year (over 300) create good conditions for year-round rest at the Caucasus Mineral Waters resorts.
And then the body needs rest not only in the summer.
So you don't have to worry about the weather outside the window, especially since most procedures are done indoors and do not depend on the season.
In general, it is advisable to treat in a spa and resort twice a year, especially for older people.
The main feature of the Caucasus Mineral Water region is, of course, the therapeutic mineral sources: Slavian, Smirnov, Yessentuki, Narzan.
Their water has unique properties and affects various body systems.
Water varies in temperature, salt content, overall mineralization, chemical and gas composition.
The doctor chooses the water according to the patient's condition.
Narzan has anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory effects, restores the function of the gastrointestinal tract and metabolism.
Essentials-4 affects the gastrointestinal tract, lowers sugar levels.
"Essentuki nova" has anti-inflammatory, bile- and urine-dependent effects.
The same effects are also found in Slavian water.
When administering water, the doctor must take into account the condition of the cardiovascular system.
If there are signs of hypertension, he chooses less salty water because salts hold fluid, which leads to increased pressure.
Mineral water intake requires a regimen: water should be drunk at a certain time, in the right amount and at a specific temperature.
Now, the sanatoriums also offer a variety of cosmetic procedures for the face and body.
What kind of natural healing can be provided in the North Caucasus resort?
Near Pyatigorsk, for example, there is the salt lake Tambukan, from which the sludge is useful for joints, spine, and internal organs.
It has anti-inflammatory, absorbent, immunomodulating effects.
These are self-guided walks.
They are especially popular in Kislovodsk, where there is a huge resort park (the second largest in Europe).
They are popular in Kislovodsk, which is located in the immediate vicinity of the mineral spring "Narzan".
You can also take wine, pearl, yogurt, selenium, safflower and lacquer baths, depending on what your doctor prescribes.
Let's keep the fruit.
What can be done to keep the harvest going until the end of the season?
It's by Yulia Belopukhova, an agronomist and a dairyman.
Adult tomatoes should have their hair cut: remove the new stems, cut the buds, remove all the leaves until the last fruit brush and the flower buds with small stems - they will not ripen.
All tomatoes, regardless of "constitution", as well as pepper and baccage, are fed with a sulphur-superphosphate extract, processed with bioproperates (Dozrevatel - to speed up the infusion and growth of fruits, Phytoespurin-M, Phytolavin, Gamair, Bactophyt - from diseases, Immunocytophyt - to increase immunity, Bitoxybasillin, Lepidocid, Fitoverm - if there are pests).
Of the chemicals at the end of summer, only copper cuporose, colloidal sulfur and green soap are used.
We're doing the last watering of the plants.
The long-leaved cucumbers in the greenhouse are lowered from the spalers so that the lower, bare part of the stem (25-40 cm) lies on the ground, watered with warm water and a solution of Circon, sprinkled the stem 5-7 cm of compost.
It is also easy to prolong the fruit-bearing of the cabbage: cut out the old leaves, pour warm water and a solution of complex fertilizer, and sprinkle the fertile soil under the bush.
To protect against the cold at night, place a sheltered arch over the arch.
Keep the plants open during the day and close after sunset.
Signs of the end.
What indicates that Russia is coming out of the crisis?
Economists have seen signs of Russia emerging from the most prolonged recession in the last twenty years.
According to analysts interviewed by Bloomberg, the GDP of Russia is showing a positive dynamic - in the second quarter, GDP decreased by 0.8% in annual terms.
This is the lowest since the beginning of 2015.
According to the latest data from Rosstat, the Russian economy's decline in the second quarter slowed to 0.6%.
The Central Bank and the Ministry of Economic Development have also recently declared a stabilization of the situation.
The slow growth ahead.
According to the experts of the Central Bank, the recession in the Russian economy is a thing of the past.
"The index assessment of Russia's GDP indicates that the recession is behind, and the slow growth of the economy is ahead", the Bank of Russia's "What Trends Say" bulletin says.
The regulatory specialists have increased the modular assessment of GDP for the current quarter to 0.4%, the assessment for the fourth quarter is 0.5%.
According to the representative of the Ministry of Economic Development, during the second quarter, the decline in the GDP of the Russian Federation stopped in the second quarter, at 0.2%.
In the second quarter, the seasonalally-purified decline in GDP was 0.2% compared to the previous quarter.
But during the quarter, the decline stopped: in April it was 0.2%, and in May and June, the change in GDP was in the range of 0-0.15", the representative of the Ministry of Economic Affairs of RIA Novosti quoted.
The slowdown in the Russian economy over the past five quarters is a sign that "a long way has passed".
Among other markers that indicate signs of a national economy reviving, Bloomberg calls the growth in demand for electricity and rail transportation a business revival.
If we correct that the year is leaping, then it's clear that the dynamics of the plus 1% electricity consumption can be half-determined by the extra working day.
Add to that the lower annual average temperature in the first quarter.
The next argument is the growth of freight transport, but it is difficult to get accurate data here, and the plus-minus 0.5% of the half-year volume can also be explained by seasonality", explains Kirill Yakovenko of ALOR BROKER.
However, there are other, more obvious signs of stabilizing the Russian economy.
For example, lowering price pressure.
In July, the consumer price index was 7.2%, compared with 15.6% in the same month last year.
Moreover, the last two weeks, Rosstat has been recording deflation.
Prices in Russia fell for the first time in five years.
If you look at the dynamics of the ruble, which, although it showed strong fluctuations at the beginning of the year, at the end of August since the beginning of the year has strengthened by 12%.
This is also one of the signs of recovery, which should be followed by real sector indicators", Yakovenko emphasizes.
In addition, since April in the Russian Federation there has been an increase in the volume of industrial production.
In June, it rose 1.7%.
The pace of falling foreign trade turnover is slowing from -32.8% in January 2016 to -20.7% in May.
The positive dynamics are also reflected in the labour market, where unemployment has fallen to 5.4%.
It was only lower in September 2015 (5,2%).
Despite the prosperous labour market situation, the question of real disposable incomes is left to the best.
In annual terms, the figure is down 4.8%.
This can slow the recovery of the economy, as household spending contributes significantly to GDP.
In general, their share in the economy is more than 50%.
In addition to low consumer activity, the Bank of Russia's tough policy can also be cited as a risk factor for economic growth.
The regulator is holding the rate at 10.5%, which is not a good thing for the real sector.
The negative factor is also the insufficiently high level of investment, which hinders the development of industrial potential.
But in general, it can be assumed that by the end of the year the rate of decline of the Russian economy will slow down to -0.5% compared to -3.7% in 2015", - says analyst of the GK Forex Club Irina Rogowa.
The process of naturalising athletes, recently launched in Russian football and well adapted to winter sports at the Sochi Olympics, has not yet been so actively developed in summer sports.
If former foreigners are representing Russia at the Rio Olympics, most of the time they are native to the former Soviet republics.
But in Rio de Janeiro, we can see the reverse process - a fairly large number of Russians are flying other countries' flags.
In each case, the history of a change of citizenship is different.
Some parents took them away as children without a choice.
Someone couldn't resist the competition for a spot in the Russian national team.
And some thought that the country would create better conditions for development in sports.
"AIF.ru" found at least 16 athletes who decided to change their Russian citizenship.
The 27-year-old German passport says her name is Lisa Ridge.
But before that, she was, of course, Elizabeth.
She was born in 1988 in Omsk.
Just four years after the collapse of the Soviet Union, Lisa's parents decided to emigrate to Germany.
The girl had no choice.
There she decided to follow in her older sister's footsteps - to do athletics.
Like her sister, Lisa chose to jump with a six.
If she stayed in Russia, she would hardly be able to "move off the throne" Yelena Isinbayev.
Unfortunately, at the Rio Olympics, Lisa will be the only female, if any, former female, in the sixth-place jump.
Her best achievements in this sport are the bronze at the 2010 European Championship and the silver at the 2016 Continental Championship, which she won again in the absence of Elena Isinbayeva.
29-year-old Elena Pirogkova was born in Novokuznetsk in 1986.
Her parents were evangelical religious propagandists.
Much of their faith led them to move to the United States when the girl was only three years old.
Besides Elena, the family had eight children.
They all lived in the small town of Greenfield, Massachusetts.
Lena started wrestling in high school.
She showed good results and moved to Colorado Springs, where she continued her training at the U.S. Training Center for Struggle under the guidance of another former Russian, Vladislav Izboynikov.
At the 2012 London Olympics, Elena lost her first fight.
But at the world championship that same year, it was a win.
Before that, she had won silver at the 2010 World Championships.
After that, there was a bronze in 2013 and a silver in 2014.
Maria, 26, was born in Yaroslavl, where she first learned to swim.
But it would be wrong to say that she was raised by our coaches in Russia.
Soon, the girl's family decided to emigrate to the United States and settle in Colorado.
There Mary continued her classes.
She soon made the U.S. National Team and performed well at the Pan American Games.
It is clear that at a serious international level, Russian synchronicists cannot compete with it, but for America, its indicators are a ceiling.
The new name, which sounds strange in Russian, Christina Shaldina got at the age of 11 when her parents decided to continue her artistic gymnastics training overseas.
Until this moment, the girl was engaged in her favorite sport in her native Yaroslavl.
After emigrating to the United States, she quickly joined the national youth team, and later broke into the main national team.
At the Pan American Games, 19-year-old Kristen won gold and silver.
She didn't have to fight for first place on the world stage, of course, but she made a real breakthrough for the United States - she led the star-studded national team to the Rio de Janeiro Olympics.
Another former "artist" is Jana Berezko-Marggrander, who plays for the German national team.
Jana was born in Toliatti.
In 2008, when the girl was 13, her family decided to move to Germany - where she had more chances of making the national team.
She soon represented her country at the 2012 London Olympics.
There, however, Jan managed to take only 17th place, not enough to qualify for the final in the individual championship.
But two years earlier, she had won the bronze medal at the Youth Olympic Games.
Another gymnast, but this time a sportswoman, Irina Sazonova.
If the migration routes of the aforementioned athletes are standard, Irina's family's choice is very unusual - Iceland.
Ira is a student at the Volgograd sports school.
Of course, in Iceland, she was immediately crowned national champion.
Ira is training in Russia, but he comes to his homeland to keep his skills.
She didn't perform as well in Rio as she'd like.
Best finish is 40th in the individual multiplayer.
Little is known about Maria Ugolkovy in the Russian information space.
Maria has been living and training in Switzerland for a very long time.
However, for a long time she performed under the Russian flag, showing good results - even the country's record at the 200 meter butterfly.
In 2015, she received Swiss citizenship and began performing under the red and white flag.
Her best performance in Rio is 14th place in the 4×100 relay.
To get to the games, the girl launched a crowdfunding project, which allowed her to raise about 6,000 francs to pay for her Olympic training.
31-year-old free-style fighter Adam Batirov has spent almost his entire career under the Russian flag.
During this time, the native of Kassavurt managed to become a three-time European championship winner, Russian champion, Russian sports master of international class.
When he stopped playing for our national team, it was time to think about changing citizenship.
For a few years, a talented fighter disappeared from the sporting world.
The triumphal return took place at the 2016 Asian Championships - Batirov had already represented Bahrain, for which he won a gold medal and received a ticket to the Rio Olympics.
Another ex-Russian, Mikhail Kudinov, is even less known in his homeland than the Swiss swimmer Maria Ugolkov.
The fact is that his parents emigrated from Vladivostok to New Zealand when the boy was very young.
It was there that Michael began to study sports gymnastics.
He has not achieved great success at the international level.
In Rio, his best result was 40th place in the qualifying at parallel bars.
But even qualifying for the Olympics in gymnastics is a breakthrough for New Zealand.
Born in Moscow in 1985, Nasty's family emigrated to Israel when she was just nine.
There, the girl continued her synchronized swimming lessons, showing high results at the national level.
In 2014, at the European Championships in Berlin, she took 6th place in synchronized swimming.
In the duet with Eugenia Tettelbaum Anastasia took the eighth place.
She was fifth in the solo program.
Like Anastasia, 23-year-old Dmitry Kroyter is a defender for the Israeli national team.
When the boy was only six years old, his mother decided to repatriate to Israel.
In 2009, at the age of 17, Dmitry became the country's champion.
That same year he won the World Youth Championship.
A year later, Croiter also won gold at the Singapore Youth Olympic Games.
In addition to high jumps, Dmitry also does long jumps and triple jumps.
Albert, 31, is another native of Hasavjurt, who after a long career in Russia, decided to change his sports citizenship.
However, unlike Batirov, Albert chose Romania, which he would represent in Rio.
In Russia, he played for the Krasnoyarsk School of Higher Sportsmanship, and in 2011 he became the country's champion.
Oleg Antonov, 28, was born in Moscow to Yaroslav Antonov, a volleyball player for the USSR national team.
Just a year before his son Yaroslav was named the best volleyball player on the planet.
Soon he decided to pursue a career in Italy.
The family stayed there for a permanent residence.
In 2015, he became the bronze medalist of the European Championship, held in his new homeland.
Hajiyev was born in Chechnya in 1994 and was caught with his family in the middle of the war.
Ten years later, my parents decided to emigrate.
The original goal was Norway, but we couldn't get to this northern country - we had to go to France, to Nice.
There, Zalimhan continued his training in free wrestling.
He soon won the junior world championship, and later qualified for the Olympics.
In Rio, he will be the only Frenchman to compete in the wrestling tournament.
And again free struggle, and again a former Russian.
This time it's about a North Ossetian who emigrated to Spain, Timuraze Freieva.
In late December 2012, he was granted Spanish citizenship, and currently plays for the national team of that country.
Before that, the 30-year-old athlete had already achieved high results in Russia.
He became the bronze medalist of the 2007 and 2008 national championships.
Tired of not being in the national team, Timur decided to change his sports citizenship.
The latest on our list is the Chechen boxer, born in 1995 in the capital of Dagestan, Mahachkala, Arthur Biyarslanov.
When the boy was ten years old, his parents moved the family through Azerbaijan to Canada.
There, Arthur took up boxing on the advice of his older brother.
Since then, Arthur has won the Canadian championship three times, and in 2012 he became the world junior champion.
In 2015, Biyarslanov won the Pan American Games gold, his first for his new homeland since 1975.

Married, has a son.
Why do children have Kazakh classes in schools?
According to Governor V. Kondratyev, "the Cossacks should be educated not by actions and parades, but systematically".
They must grow up and at least from the age of 7 understand that they are Cossacks and education must be Cossack.
But as long as this work is done, I think it's done formally and, I suspect, more on paper.
If the Kazakh classes absorb all the positive things that have been accumulated in the past, at a qualitatively new level, I will be happy.
If everything goes wrong and you don't know how, a new idea will become cheap populism.
Housing continues to be one of the most criminal sectors of the country's economy.
The Commission has also adopted a number of proposals for a new directive on the protection of workers' rights.
According to the Prosecutor General's Office, the high tariffs are one of the most common crimes in the housing sector.
As a result, consumers of the region overpaid energy companies more than 170 million rubles.
The Prosecutor's Office of the Krasnodar Territory has revealed the fact that unreasonable costs have been included in the tariffs.
And at the expense of the "IV-consulting" (which supplies cold water) LLC, 4 million rubles were put into the lease of cars at a price higher than the market price.
And examples of this are in the country of the masses.
The people pay the last money for the "communal" and pay correctly, according to the Ministry of Construction of the Russian Federation, the average collection of payments from the population is 94%.
He is charged with several articles of the Criminal Code: racketeering, legalization of income obtained through criminal activity, abuse of power, etc.
According to the investigation, as the head of the fund, who was engaged in repairing city facilities, Makarov had contracts with entrepreneurs, the work on them was not actually performed, but paid.
The businessmen just gave him back most of the money.
As the owner of the crime, Makarov collected money from the population, but did not pay the service providers and spent it on his own needs.
The resulting damage to the budget and the residents - millions of rubles.
The pattern of Makarov's machinations, unfortunately, is typical of Russia.
A wave of arrests and detentions of the leaders of the criminal justice system, who had embezzled citizens' money, has swept the country.
In Kamchatka, the trial of A. Kohan, also a former deputy of the city council, is ongoing, who is accused of fraud for 91,7 million rubles.
According to the investigation, in 2012-2013, he founded 6 management companies in Elizov, Kamchatka and created 3 limited liability companies.
One of them was a contractor for the UK, the other two were a cash-and-cash center, that is, they were taking money from the population.
However, A. Kohan did not transfer the funds to the energy company, but spent on himself, his loved one.
It's pretty hard to judge in housing.
It's not exciting, it's getting long.
And this is a very complicated housing legislation, - says Svetlana Razovrotneva, executive director of the NP "Housing Control".
We don't get to make one law as we come up with a new one that should make the old one work.
There are also few experts, including judges, on housing.
The lawyers themselves admit that housing law is very little regarded at universities.
The refusal to bring criminal charges, the involvement of the prosecutor general in the investigation, is also mentioned.
Of the 3,5 thousand crimes in the 2015 proceedings, less than half were sent to the court.
The rest of the investigation is long-term, and every fifth is suspended due to the lack of a defendant.
Often, the shortcomings in the activities of law enforcement bodies are attributed to gaps in the current legislation.
There's a law, but the investigation is quick to start and investigate.
In the second half of 2015, there were about 230 reports of counterfeiting - only 60 criminal cases were filed.
In the last five months of this year, the number has increased only slightly - 99.
What is a forgery of the minutes of the meeting of the residents?
This means that the change of management, the financial and other issues are going beyond the owners' opinions.
And that means that normal companies that want to work honestly, not feed the population, can't enter the housing and utilities market.
So the residents are down, the small and medium businesses are down, too.
First of all, it is through the eradication of corruption as such throughout the state, says Anton Zarkov, a member of the State Duma's Property Committee.
And now that work is going on.
It's not just a single stock, it's a targeted course to fight corruption.
Of course, not all regions are in such a sad situation.
In particular, the capital is scandalous and doesn't smell.
Why are there no housing scandals in Moscow like in many other regions?
Yes, because the government of the capital has shown iron will and order", Anatoly Vyborny, a member of the State Duma Committee on Security and Anti-Corruption, told "AIF".
I mean the human resources issue, the legislative amendments, and legal education.
The management companies are under strict supervision, and they've all been through licensing.
The citizens' complaints are quickly resolved in public (and residents' appeals, and response measures are posted on the portal of the Moscow government).
Many people do not simply pay their monthly receipts but also carefully monitor the home's contents.
The awareness among the population about the rights and obligations of resource-providing and management organizations is very high.
Moscow also checks the validity of the tariffs on housing and utilities - a large part of the budget goes to subsidies and benefits for many categories of the population.
I guess that explains the calm conditions in Moscow.
So, it all depends on the regional authorities?
Maybe the unemployed should change their jobs.
Turkish gambit.
Can Erdogan refuse to be friends with the EU and the US?
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has put forward an ultimatum to the United States, offering to choose between Turkey and Fethullah Gülen, an Islamic preacher accused of organizing a coup.
He said this in Ankara, speaking to his supporters.
Erdogan urged Americans to abandon support for the "fethullah terrorist organization".
This is not the first Turkish statement in which the US calls for a change of position.
Experts believe that the divide between Turkey and the West is growing and could lead to a new attempt at a change of power in the country.
"Sooner or later America will choose between Turkey and FETO".
Either the FETO or the democratic Turkey.
She must make this choice", the Anatolian agency quotes Erdogan's appeal, which was made Wednesday evening in Ankara.
The Turkish president has demanded the United States fulfill his demands again, but more forcefully, which he has voiced for the first time since the suppression of the uprising.
Recall that on the night of July 16 in Turkey, high-ranking representatives of the Turkish army attempted to overthrow the legitimate government in the country, as well as an attempt on the life of the head of state.
However, after Recep Erdogan addressed the population, the uprising was suppressed and its organizers and participants arrested.
In total, about 8,000 people were suspected, including teachers and scientists.
According to Recep Erdogan, their mentor was Fethullah Gülen, who lives in Pennsylvania, USA.
Erdogan's supporters also admitted that the U.S. could be directly involved in the coup.
The United States has denied all claims against it, refusing to extradite Gülen and advising it to change its tone.
The last statement by State Department representatives was made on Tuesday during Erdogan's visit to St. Petersburg.
But that doesn't stop the Turkish president - he insists on his own and also makes demands on other Western partners.
"Ankara will stop fulfilling its obligations under the migration agreement with the European Union if Brussels does not name the date of lifting the visa restrictions for Turkish citizens", - said the Turkish Minister for EU Affairs Omar Çelik on August 9.
He said that Ankara's amendment of the anti-terrorism law, as required by the EU, would put Europe's own security at risk.
On August 1, German Vice Chancellor Sigmar Gabriel demanded that Turkey stop blackmailing the EU with promises to open borders to migrants to ease the visa regime with the EU.
His words were a response to the relevant statement by Turkey's Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu.
Another provocative statement by Cavusoglu on Wednesday admitted that Turkey could withdraw from NATO.
The Turkish Foreign Minister did not rule out that the country would consider leaving the alliance if it did not receive the support it expected.
The decision to increase cooperation with Russia in the defense sector is not a step against NATO.
There are NATO countries that cooperate with foreign states in the defense sphere, - they import missiles", Chavushoglu said in an interview with Anadolu.
He said Turkey now needs to build its own defense system based on its technologies, as well as cooperate with other countries.
"Until now, Turkey has tried to cooperate with NATO member countries, but the results have not satisfied us, and we have started looking for others", the minister said.
Experts say this all points to Turkey's serious disagreement with the West and its reorientation to the East.
The head of the International Institute of Political Experts, Eugene Minchenko, believes that Recep Erdogan is playing his game and cannot go to a tough confrontation with the West.
He has a lot to do with the West, both in terms of business and military (Turkey is a NATO member), so I think Erdogan will try to balance it with the West.
Although, of course, Americans would be more comfortable to see a fully obedient person in this position", - explained the expert.
According to him, it is possible that after the Turkish leader's statements (about not paying EU compensation, about demanding visa-free travel with Europe and extradition of Gulen from the US) he will be pressured.
"Rejpe Erdogan will face a deterioration in relations with both America and the European Union, and they will press him on humanitarian issues, dictatorial methods of governance and so on", Minchenko said.
The head of the Center for Political Information Alexey Mukhin admits that the Turkish president will change his view on relations with Russia as soon as it becomes convenient for him.
Eight months ago, Erdogan was extremely hard on Russia and was looking for Western favor.
In a very short time, the situation changed to the opposite.
There is no guarantee that the Turkish president will not change his priorities again.
I think Erdogan entered the era of shuttle diplomacy.
If he finds himself between two poles - the West and Russia, he will try to get the maximum benefit for himself", says Muhin.
He believes that the main task for the Turkish president today is to maintain political power in the country, and for this he needs Russia and partnerships with Vladimir Putin so that the United States can stop supporting Gulen.
Turkey needs both the EU and the US, who use it to control the situation in Syria and the Middle East.
Therefore, a consensus with Turkey will be reached", the expert said.
The head of the Central Asia and the Middle East, Anna Glasova, has a different view.
Turkey's relations with the EU and the US are now quite tense, and this is primarily due to the internal policies that Erdogan personally carries out.
I think this crisis in relations will get worse, and in the face of this crisis, the Turkish leadership will try to restart policy in the Middle East and in relations with Russia.
It is no accident that the Turkish president, as well as a number of Turkish politicians, declare that they are ready to change their position on a number of issues on Syria, that relations with Israel have been settled, that there is active political interaction with Iran", explained AIF.ru Glasova, admitting that the next step of Erdogan will be normalization of relations with Egypt.
She said the policy that Erdogan is pursuing is a return to the foreign policy concept that Turkey followed before the Arab revolutions.
"It was then that Turkey began to develop its relations with the Middle East and the Asian region very actively, with the position of 'zero problems with neighbors'.
The President of Turkey has made very successful visits to Russia and other African countries.
Therefore, this foreign policy vector will develop and contribute to strengthening Turkey's position on both the regional and international arena", the expert said.
Glasova believes that Turkey's return to its former relationship with the EU will be incredibly difficult, but the question now is whether the EU will start toughening Turkey, which could open its borders to migrants and create serious problems for Europe.
The younger doctors ' strike: calls for new collective protests
The junior doctors' representatives have appealed to the union to authorize new collective protests in their dispute over a new labor contract.
The British Medical Association's (BMA) Junior Doctors Committee (JDC) is going to ask its full council to support more collective protests since early September.
JDC says the ministers were unable to answer questions about the employment contract.
Young doctors and medical students in July voted to cancel the employment contract agreed with the BMA.
It was rejected by 58 percent of its members who took part in the secret ballot.
In a letter to members posted on Twitter Thursday evening, JDC Chair Ellen McCort said the government continued to "keep a steady silence" about the issues that she said led to the rejection of the employment contract.
She said: "Given the current situation, the head of the JDC has voted against the proposed new employment contract in full and called for formal renegotiation of all your issues".
In response to the government's silence, the head of the JDC today made an official request for an extraordinary meeting of the BMA Council to approve a continuing program of expansion of collective protests beginning in early September.
The dispute led to six strikes this year involving young doctors, including the first general strike in the history of the State Health Service.
BMA junior physician leader Dr. Joan Malavan resigned after voting to cancel the agreed terms of employment contract that the BMA recommended.
He told the BMA members that the deal was a good one to accept, during the pre-voting meetings of 54,000 junior doctors and medical students.
After the vote, Secretary of Health Jeremy Hunt said that the employment contract would be used for medical workers in England.
Russia and Turkey: "A coalition of bad guys"?
It was the gesture that ended the crisis.
The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to shake hands and officially announce the end of an eight-month war of words and economic sanctions.
But when Vladimir Putin greeted his Turkish colleague in the gilded hall of the palace in St. Petersburg, I had the sustained impression that Ankara wanted more of this reconciliation.
There was a handshake, yes.
But Mr. Putin's smile looked tense, and he barely radiated heat even by his own restrained standards.
Recep Tayyip Erdogan, on the contrary, has repeatedly referred to his "dear friend" Mr Putin  five times, according to one report.
I lost my score.
He also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their pre-crisis levels, but even higher.
The next day, a newspaper described Mr. Erdogan's actions as if nothing bad ever happened.
I think his enthusiasm suggested the opposite.
But the prolonged cold coming from Mr. Putin showed that the Russian leader hadn't forgotten anything.
In fact, the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his opening remarks: Turkey shot down a Russian fighter on the Syrian border.
Moscow's reaction at the time was furious.
Mr. Putin was furious, accusing Ankara of hitting Moscow in the back.
The insult was even more intense, coming from the alleged friend.
Reestablishing real trust will be difficult, possibly impossible.
Russian public opinion has also changed since November.
For months, state-controlled media have been carrying out a staggering, total assault on Ankara.
Suddenly it seemed that the Turks should be held responsible for everything.
The most serious were allegations from senior officials that Mr. Erdogan's own family profited from the illegal oil trade from areas of Syria controlled by the so-called Islamic State.
He denied it decisively.
But St. Petersburg received an official signal that it was time to move on.
After all, this meeting only happened because Mr. Putin received the apology he demanded from President Erdogan.
Russia could have claimed a victory of some sort.
For Ankara, the benefits of a ceasefire are clear.
First of all, Erdogan needs all the friends he can get after he was nearly ousted from his post last month in a coup attempt.
The repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey clearly shocked him too.
There's also an economic reason.
Russian sanctions have hit hard  especially the ban on charter flights, which usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast every year.
The number has dropped by almost 90 percent.
As for Russia, tour operators and charter companies here will certainly feel a relief when flights are finally restored.
They're putting their season-ending spikes on the Mediterranean.
And even this week, state television predicted cheaper fruits and vegetables once Turkish agricultural imports were allowed back.
"Tourists go there, tomatoes back here", as the Vedomosti report said.
But the visit also had an added political value for Moscow.
Ankara is angry with the West for what it considers a weak response to the coup attempt.
Add to this her longstanding dissatisfaction with the turtle pace of EU accession talks and Mr Putin's move to take advantage of the cold and gradually break Turkey's ties with the West.
The Russian leader, of course, won bonus points with Ankara for calling for support for elected authorities after the coup attempt.
Keep in mind, this is a data for Moscow, which has its own deep-seated fear of regime change.
So the summit in this brilliant palace on the seashore allowed Russia and Turkey to imagine what one analyst described to me as an "alliance of the bad": two countries that feel rejected and humiliated by the West, joining forces.
Yet, despite the public display of reconciliation, the two still have significant differences.
The key is Syria, where Moscow has recently positioned itself as a peacemaker, but where Russia and Turkey support opposing sides.
Perhaps what speaks for itself is that after almost three hours of initial negotiations, while the two presidents were giving a press conference, they didn't even touch on the subject.
The President of Turkey deliberately avoided answering the question about their differences, while Mr. Putin preferred to emphasize them.
There is no clear consensus on how they can find a common language in Syria.
But after months of open hostility  and considering the possibility of a complete disaster when NATO member Turkey shot down a Russian jet fighter, it's definitely better that the two leaders at least talk again.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will disappear for customers outside Scotland
The RBS brand should be reduced to a back office, according to the bank's chief executive.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will disappear for customers outside Scotland.
Ross McEwan told BBC Scotland that the RBS brand was linked to the bank's global ambitions.
The bank has been backing away from them since it nearly collapsed eight years ago and needed to be rescued.
During this period, brand strategists used RBS to protect other consumer lending brands.
It has been supported by millions of pounds of sponsorship to international sport, from the Six Nations Rugby Cup to Wimbledon champion Andy Murray.
But now it was decided that it was right to let more national brands come to the fore.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will be used for Scottish customers, but will not be launched.
In England and Wales, all references to RBS, including the external head office and stock exchange, will be changed to NatWest.
Ulster Bank is already being used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.
There are other, smaller private banking brands that will have more influence  Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond and Holt's Military Bank.
Mr McEwan interviewed clients and staff on a tour of Invernessshire.
He told BBC Scotland: "The RBS brand will eventually become our investment brand and what our staff will be engaged in because we are now becoming more of a brand bank".
As the bank itself became a global brand, RBS became a global brand.
I'm saying that we no longer have global aspirations, we have local aspirations.
Each of these brands will represent something completely different in their respective population groups, and our staff will be working with customers under these brands.
RBS has already announced that it will not continue its sponsorship of the Six Nations Cup, and it is increasing the profile of various brands in sponsoring the sport.
"This is a good time for us to move the bank brands, as the bottom line (we asked ourselves) is how do we focus on improving the bank for customers?" said the CEO.
It would have been very cynical three years ago if we had said we were going to be a great bank for customers and shut down all these brands.
But with the work we've been doing, focusing on the needs of our clients rather than our own, I think you're seeing a lot of change.
We can bring these brands back, so I think it's time.
Frankie Dettori reaches 3,000 winners with a win at the Newmarket on Addiction .
Dettori splashes champagne after a double at Newmarket leads him to 3,000 wins.
Jockey Frankie Dettori won his 3,000th British victory at Newmarket on Friday.
He came up with this remarkable mark with his second night winner on his home track, the Addiction, trained by John Gosden.
The 45-year-old Italian is the sixth jockey to achieve this outstanding mark in the smooth jump.
He follows Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Piggott, Pat Eddery and Willie Carson.
Three-time jockey champion Dettori, who has won the Ghayyar, said, "It's something special".
I'm really excited because my family is here too.
I'm very glad that happened in Newmarket, because that's where I settled 30 years ago.
It's not a big secular event, it's not Royal Ascot, it's a regular Friday night with 20,000 people.
I'm free and very unpretentious.
Dettori receives applause when he quotes Predestination after the victory
Two jockey's have achieved this mark in obstacle-jumping: jockey champion Richard Johnson and retired 20-time champion Sir Anthony McCoy, who had more than 4,300 career wins.
Leicester Piggott, nine-time Derby winner, 4493 career wins
Frankie is one of the best jockeys of our time, and it's no wonder he's achieved a mark so few had before him.
He's stylish and strong, but it's his tactical grip that sets him apart from the rest of the weight room.
He's a great runner, and his enthusiasm and charisma have attracted fans to the sport for years.
I told Frankie a few weeks ago at Epsom, he'd have brought in 6,000 winners if he hadn't just been a weekend jockey and big-time racer!
Frankie has been leading the British team for most of the last 30 years, which is great to see.
He's an energetic character, which is good for British runners, but moreover, he's an incredible jockey.
Frankie Dettori celebrated this outstanding mark with a brand-new fast jump from a horse.
From fast finishes to fast jumps, Frankie Dettori has been a symbol of British smooth running for two decades.
It was ups and downs.
Many big-jump winners, including his famous "Great Seven" in Ascot in 1996, but he also survived an airplane crash and was disqualified for doping.
Three years ago, he first had trouble returning from a six-month disqualification, but he showed a tremendous amount of willpower to challenge skeptics and get back in shape.
And he may not have finished for a while. Dettory said earlier that he would like to continue competing until he's at least 50.
Putin fires the head of the administration Sergey Ivanov
Russian President Vladimir Putin has suddenly fired his administration head Sergei Ivanov.
Ivanov was part of Putin's trusted inner circle for many years.
The 63-year-old has now been appointed as the Environment and Transportation Commissioner.
A Kremlin statement said Putin "decided to release Ivanov from his duties as head of the Russian presidential administration", but did not give a reason.
Mr. Ivanov's deputy since 2012, Anton Waino, has been appointed his successor.
Mr. Waino, 44, a former diplomat.
Born in 1972 in Tallinn, Estonia, he graduated from the prestigious Moscow State University of International Relations (MGIMO) and served in the Tokyo embassy.
He later served as head of the presidential protocol and government apparatus, the Kremlin's website reports.
During his appointment, he said to Putin, "Thank you for your trust".
I think the most important task of the administration is to support your activities as a head of state in terms of drafting laws and controlling how your instructions are being implemented.
Putin told a Russian TV channel on Friday that Ivanov had asked to be relieved of his position and recommended that Vayno replace him.
Does a smile convince you?
This is a move that has puzzled Moscow.
Sergei Ivanov was for a long time one of Vladimir Putin's closest supporters and, like him, served in the Soviet security service, the KGB.
As head of the administration, he was one of the most powerful men in the country.
At a meeting with President Putin, which was shown on state television, both men said the head of the administration had resigned on his own.
But despite the smile on camera, it's not convincing anyone here, especially right now, just before the parliamentary elections.
So, are these the unintended consequences of some kind of power struggle?
No one knows yet.
But the official statement that a man once promoted as a potential president suddenly wanted to run Russian environmental policy was met with great skepticism.
In comments to Putin, quoted on the Kremlin website, Ivanov said: "It is true that in early 2012 I asked you in an interview to entrust me with this very difficult, even, if you can say, problematic position, for four years.
Well, I was the head of the president's administration for four years and eight months.
Ivanov took office in December 2011.
He previously served as deputy prime minister and defense minister.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and a former member of the KGB's state security service, as is Mr. Putin.
In the late 1990s, when Putin was head of the Federal Security Service (FSB), which replaced the KGB, Ivanov was appointed his deputy.
When Putin came to power, he named Ivanov among the five people he trusted most.
It was once believed that Ivanov could become the president of Russia after Putin's second term, as a third term for Putin would be against the constitution.
However, this post was taken over by another close supporter of Putin, Dmitry Medvedev.
Putin became prime minister until he returned to the presidency after only three and a half years.
Think Like a Criminal star Thomas Gibson fired after a fight with a producer
Gibson was a shooter on the set of the show in Los Angeles last month.
ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios, which produce the series, announced his resignation in a joint statement.
Gibson, who played Special Agent Aaron Hotchner, apologized Thursday before his suspension was announced.
There were creative differences and differences of opinion.
I'm sorry this happened", he said in a statement.
Details of how Gibson's character will be removed from the show, which follows a team of FBI agents, are expected later, according to ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios.
The 54-year-old actor, who previously starred in the sitcom Dharma and Greg, has been with the show since its first season in 2005.
"I love Think Like a Criminal and have been putting my heart and soul into it for the past twelve years", Gibson said in a statement released Friday.
I was hoping to be there for the rest of my life, but now it's not going to be possible.
I just want to thank the writers, producers, actors, our great team, and most importantly, the greatest fans the show could have dreamed of.
It's noted that the show will return with its twelfth season on September 28.
Mystery: Fish landed in Banff's garden
A man from Banff asked for help identifying the fish that appeared in his garden in Banff.
Kevin Bain thinks 75 fish could be sand dunes left by the water thunder.
Bain, who lives 500 yards from the sea, put the footage of this sight in the Periscope in the hope that someone could shed light on the appearance of the two-inch fish.
The bridge is now connected to Fife.
The 1.35 billion pound project is now due to be completed by May 2017
Engineers have connected the northern runway and the Queensferry Crossing viaduct, which means the bridge is now connected to Fife.
This is the first of four intersections between the canvas beams that are now nearing completion at all three pillars of the bridge.
The section of the bridge from Fife is now 600 meters long and weighs 30,000 tons.
It has 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 watts of bridge.
The 1.35 billion pound project is now due to be completed by May 2017.
Economy Minister Keith Brown visited the site today and was among the first to walk from the ground to the bridge.
He said, "This is a historic and symbolic moment in the construction of the Queensferry Crossing.
We're all witnessing the engineering of a truly epic scale in this project, where over 30,000 tons of concrete and steel were used only to build this part of the bridge.
Despite the massive size and weight of the bridge, completing the intersection between the viaduct and the bridge canvas is a virtuous operation using extremely precise allowances for assembly.
In total, about 79 percent of the bridge canvas is now in place, and for the last section of the canvas, concrete is being poured into Rosetta today, which means that the canvas is ready to be lifted to its place on the bridge.
Michael Martin, project director for Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors, said: "The first connection to every bridge project is always a significant milestone.
In this amazing project, this blending is the most modern building art.
After installing the last section of the road and connecting it to the expanding North Pilon road, we had to close the remaining gap on the northern side or the shore-facing side.
This was done by pulling the northern approach viaduct 700 millimeters further south.
It was a large-scale operation, but also a very elegant one.
It's massive because the viaduct is 222 meters long, weighs about 6,000 tons and had to be raised at an angle of about 3 percent inclination.
It was elegant because the allowances the team was working on were tiny  just a few millimeters in each direction.
Thankfully, it all went very well.
Salvation in Moelfr Bay: Three men 'got away with life'
Three men 'survived' after being thrown from a fishing boat in England.
Moelfre RNLI rescue station raised the alarm at 13:20 British Summer Time on Friday after the team saw the incident unfolding in Moelfre Bay.
Three men struggled to reach a safe place while their ship continued to move.
"We saw their ship circling beside them and assumed the worst", said Moelfre lifeboat steeringman Vince Jones.
"Fortunately, by the time we got down to the water, a strong wind had taken him away from them", he added.
Two men were rescued by a local fishing boat, and a third man, 60, was found exhausted and stuck in a buoy without a life jacket.
They were all picked up aboard a shore lifeboat and taken to the rescue station .
Jones said: "The three men who were thrown into the water were lucky to be alive and completely unharmed.
The boat's engine had an emergency locker, but it somehow broke off from the man who was driving the boat when it overturned.
Somebody was guarding these guys today.
Pokémon Go, a worthy hunt for health and happiness
It's exciting to watch the world change.
The fact that teenagers and children no longer go out to play, preferring to spend their free time looking at screens, has been a complaint of many over the past decade.
Pokemon Go takes people off the couch and engages them in some physical activity.
Time on the screen was initially limited to television, then video games, and more recently smartphones.
It's so great to see that technology and street activity are not mutually exclusive.
I mean, of course, the down-to-earth hobby of Pokémon Go, a character-based app originally created for video games in the 1990s (which later spawned a series of cartoons, playing cards, and other branches).
Like many other pop culture phenomena, it all lost its former relevance a little before this new game was available in the US, Australia and New Zealand in early July.
Launch in other countries at the time was delayed due to a massive response that overloaded the servers.
In a matter of days, Pokémon Go had more users than Tinder and almost as many as Twitter.
So how does it work?
In short, smartphone gamers go looking for Pokémon that are tracked by GPS and, when detected, can be 'photographed' (via a screenshot on your phone) or 'caught'.
The generation that played the game as younger joined the hobby of diving, cutting off the sofas to search.
In the United States, gambling has led to a significant increase in the number of steps taken by "normal" people every day.
Cardiogram, an app for the Apple Watch that tracks 35,000 users, recently reported to the Washington Post that within two days of the game's launch, the number of people they tracked who exercised 30 minutes a day jumped from 45 percent to 53 percent.
The company doesn't know who's playing Pokémon Go, it's just seeing the initial data on the levels.
Many health campaigns that encourage people to "find 30 minutes", "get off the couch", and "be active every day" have not been met because most health messages are boring and are spoken by people who look unhappy.
Nevertheless, the importance of physical exercise cannot be underestimated.
Those who exercise regularly reduce their chances of developing cancer or depression.
Physical activity helps with weight correction, high blood pressure, diabetes, and even a long list of benefits, too long to cite here.
But the beauty of Pokémon Go is that it pulls people out to do what they love.
Thus, three basic health principles are encompassed: movement, fresh air, sunlight, and joy.
Some people even make new friends hunting.
As usual, there are boring bastards looking for something to complain about.
And yes, someone could run into the door.
What's the matter?
The breakthrough has been made.
Because even though apps for smartphones like Fitbit could track our physical activity in the past, they didn't give us the exercise that this game does.
The novelty will come, and the use will weaken over time.
However, with the success of Pokemon, more games will be released that will combine apps and virtual reality with physical activity in the real world, helping many people in the hunt to be more active, fit and healthy.

Simone Bayles wins the gold in the women 's gymnastics championship
Forget about the pressure.
Forget about the hustle.
Simone Baylz is immune to all this.
Dynamic on the spring.
Free on the wood.
It's stunning on the floor.
It's amazing everywhere.
And now, finally, the Olympic champion.
The 19-year-old American gymnast rose to the title of champion in the absolute championship on Thursday, placing a gap between herself and the rest of the world in a convincing demonstration under intense Olympic attention.
Her total score of 62.198 was close enough to the silver medalist and "Final Five" team mate Eli Reisman and the Russian bronze medalist Aliya Mustafina.
Bails from the United States is performing on the gymnastic pole during the final of the women's individual all-around artistic gymnastics competition at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, on Thursday.
Bales became the fourth American woman to win the title of absolute champion and fifth overall, cementing her reputation as the best of her generation and perhaps ever.
She was crying when she got her final score and her long journey to that point was over.
This achievement puts her in the same league as the exceptionally rare athletes like Michael Phelps, who have taken their sports to new heights:
Bails has spent the past three years dominating her sport, winning 15 world championship medals - including 10 golds - with such stunning programs in their combination of hard work and precision that 1984 Olympic champion Mary Lou Retton called her "the greatest gymnast I've ever seen".
One final test was in Brazil, a competition not so much between Bayles and the rest of the field as between her and the burden of exaggerated expectations.
Anything less than going back to your family's house in Spring, Texas, with a handful of gold medals would be considered an unjustified expectation.
United States women's singles champion Simone Bails, left, and Eli Reisman are hugging after winning gold and silver respectively in the final of the women's individual all-around artistic gymnastics event at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Thursday, Aug.
Bails won her first gold on Tuesday, becoming the final chord for the farewell party of retired national team coordinator Martha Carroll.
While Bayles insisted she never looked into the future on her long journey to the top, that's not true.
Part of her free exercise program, which includes her signature runway, is set to Latin American music that would fit right in the house outside the Rio Olympic Arena.
It's not a coincidence.
A girl adopted by her grandparents as a child and introduced by coach Amy Burman's mother during a visit to the gym where Burman was a coach became a force.
She hasn't lost a single championship race since the summer of 2013  the lucky streak, which should last as long as Bayles wants.
Although Mustafina gained a slight advantage with two turns, it was a mirage.
Gymnastic woodworking and free practice  where Bayles defends the title of world champion  lie in ambush.
She came back out ahead with 15,433 on the wood and finished with 15,933 on the floor.
Rysman gently embraced her as they waited for the final score  pure formality  and tears appeared around a glowing red with white and blue underpants for Bails' eyes when the plan she once recorded for a snippet album came true.
Reisman's performance was a small revenge for what happened four years ago when she shared third place but lost to Mustafaina in the bronze at the tie-break.
This time, the 22-year-old captain of the team, who the Americans call "Grandma", was way ahead.
She sent kisses to the crowd after her free exercise covered in a return that sometimes seemed questionable.
As for Bayles, the viral tweet of a 19-year-old from earlier this week is now of a whole new significance:
Police: 3 victims in a serial killer case shot while listening to music in a car
Two women and a 12-year-old girl who died in the deadliest shooting in the first Phoenix serial killer in a decade were sitting in a car talking and listening to music when they were shot, according to police reports released Thursday.
Angela Rochelle Layner, Stephanie R. Ellis and their daughter, Malia Ellis, were shot on June 12 when their car was parked on the sidewalk, authorities said.
The offender fired about eight shots from a gun while standing on the passenger side of the car, then went into hiding in another vehicle, the report said.
Police say the triple murder is not likely to be the result of a robbery, as the assailant did not take the wallet or $2,900 that was in the possession of one of the adult victims.
Phoenix police spokesman, Sergeant Jonathan Howard, said the shooting prompted investigators to investigate whether he was connected to the four previous attacks.
A total of seven people were killed and two others wounded in nine attacks in two predominantly Latin American areas over four months.
"It's happening in the residential area in front of the house", Howard told KPHO, a CBS affiliate, earlier this month.
The suspect is believed to have used several vehicles, including a brown Nissan in the late 1990s, a black BMW in the late 1990s, and a white Cadillac or Lincoln.
Investigators refused to release evidence that led them to conclude that the attacks were linked and committed by the same killer.
Ellis, 33, was hospitalized with injuries and later died.
Liner, 31, and his daughter Ellis, Malia, were killed on the spot.
The witness told the police that there was nothing unusual about them sitting in a parked car listening to music.
Authorities also released a police report of a shooting that targeted an empty pickup truck half an hour before the triple murder and which is believed to have been the work of a serial killer.
Investigators found the gills and pulled the bullet from the seat and the bullet fragments from the engine compartment.
Mother of a 6-year-old with microcephaly: "It's getting better"
Like most six-year-olds, Edmund Picasso loves singing, toys, and, of course, his mother.
But unlike most of his peers, Edmund has microcephaly, a genetic disorder that his mother Elizabeth Pixivto did not know about during her pregnancy.
When he first came home, my first thought was, "I can't do this".
I can't do that.
I didn't sign it.
Which, in fact, is not true  of course you sign it", she said.
She and her husband, Vincent, were told that Edmund might never recognize them and that he might not even survive.
Some doctors even suggested that he be placed in a specialized medical facility.
"My first response was, 'I didn't think people would do that anymore,'" Pixivto explained.
Edmund walks with the help of walkers.
Edmund didn't sit or crawl until he was three, and he still doesn't speak.
But it's slowly going through some stages.
He walks with the help of others and rides a bicycle.
He also enjoys playing with his two brothers and singing.
Elizabeth shows the gesture that Edmund made up for "please sing me".
"We're teaching him sign language", Pixivto told CBS News.
But it's not just a normal sign language. She says Edmund invented his own gestures.
Microcerephalgia can occur due to a number of different circumstances: genetic infections, such as those in Edmund, and infections during pregnancy from viruses such as measles and Zika.
The symptoms and prognosis may vary significantly.
It's too early to tell how this will affect the lives of those infected with Zika.
Pixivto recalls emotional losses from an uncertain future.
Did I always say what was going to happen?
What's going to happen?
And she still doesn't know.
I didn't actually ask for a lifetime forecast because I don't expect anyone to actually tell me.
But Pixivto has some encouraging advice for mothers of children with birth defects because of Zeke.
It's getting better.
You know it'll make you better.
You'll love your child, and your child will love you.
Heavy rain, flooding, rescue efforts in Louisiana, Mississippi
Heavy rain and widespread flooding in Louisiana forced the governor to declare a state of emergency on Friday, with even more rainfall expected to fall over the state through Saturday inclusive.
Numerous rivers in southeastern Louisiana and southern Mississippi have washed up and are threatening widespread flooding after heavy rainfall, the National Weather Service said.
Louisiana Governor John Bell Edwards said state officials are in constant contact with local authorities and assistance has already been sent to the affected parishes.
Mike Steele, a spokesman for the Governor's Office of National Security and Emergency Preparedness, said that requests for transportation for high water, boats and sandbags were coming in.
Steele said that only the arrival of Tangipahoa asked for tens of thousands of bags of sand.
Flood hazard remains in effect through Saturday in much of southern Louisiana.
The weather service said in a statement that an additional 35 inches could be pouring into the area.
In southern Alabama, flood watch was in effect until Friday, as rain continued to rain in the Mobile area.
The Comet River near Baton Rouge and the Eight River near Denny Springs, both in Louisiana, were projected to set a record for flood levels over the past weekend.
Synopsisist Alec Crawtmann said that both rivers could flood many homes in the suburbs near Baton Rouge.
He also said that the flooding that is going downstream at Assenshen Pass is a threat, as these swollen rivers will slowly flow into Morp Lake.
The Tikhoe River, just south of the Mississippi state line in Liverpool, Louisiana, reached its highest level ever recorded at 9 a.m. on Friday.
Rescuers were still rescuing people from flooding in Emmit and Wilkinson counties in southwestern Mississippi.
Leroy Hansford, his wife and their livestock were among those rescued early Friday near Gloucester.
Hansford, 62, says that the waters of Beaver Creek, which are usually more than 400 feet from his home, rose rapidly overnight.
He said another shepherd who lives nearby warned him.
"We woke up, and the water kept coming", said Hansford.
She's at my belt level.
His wife told Hansford it was the biggest tidal wave she'd seen in 48 years of living here.
Hansford said that he and all his family members have disabilities, and he's the only one who can swim.
Hansford said rescue workers rescued all three with the help of an army truck and took them to the Gloucester Fire Station, where they were hiding on Friday.
Krautmann says the flooding "is spreading rapidly" as the rains continue, noting that officials are considering an evacuation order.
Krautmann says one observer near Livingston reported a drop of 13.75 inches of rain from midnight to Friday morning.
Krautmann said the soil was overgrown with rainfall from the environment.
Heavy rain and flooding have led to rescue efforts in Tanjipahoa Parish and the cancellation of classes in five school districts, authorities say.
WWL, a CBS affiliate, reports that Tanjipahoa's counselor has reported 200 homes flooded.
Residents were evacuated to two churches, but they're both flooding now.
Parish President Robbie Miller said authorities rescued 72 people and seven pets from the high water.
Shelters were opened in the towns of Emmit and Hammond to accommodate those evacuated.
"They will be able to return home as soon as the water starts to recede", he said.
In the town of Hammond, Tanjipahoa Parish, about two dozen streets were closed due to high water levels, and sandbags were available to hand over to residents in the hope that they would keep water away from homes and businesses.
"The last major flood we had was in March", said city manager Lacey Landrum.
It's on its way to becoming a similar event.
In Harrison County, Mississippi, Emergency Services Chief Rupert Lacy said that the heavy rain continued to rain along the Gulf Coast.
He said several homes were listed as flooded on Thursday, but none were listed on Friday.
Kate Towson, the head of Shopper Value Foods in Eight, has lived in the area for 40 years.
"I saw water in places I'd never seen it before", said Towson, "and it still pours down to the ground".
Majah Brown, 6, "shot down", survives the shooting in Philadelphia
Police say a 6-year-old boy was shot in Philadelphia, registering a second shooting of a 6-year-old in the city this week.
The baby's grandparents identified him for CBS Philadelphia as Mahaj Brown.
Grandma and Grandpa say Brown suffered multiple gunshot wounds, including his jaw, leg, arm and stomach, but was conscious when he was taken to the hospital.
"He got sick of it, his little body was carved with bullets", his grandmother Delores Melendez tells the station.
I just can't believe it.
The boy is in critical condition and has undergone several surgeries.
The family told the station he's expected to recover.
He was supposed to go to the first grade at the local elementary school.
Brown was one of four people shot in the Germantown neighborhood.
They also shot three men, two 29-year-olds and one 32-year-old.
One of the 29-year-old men is reported to be in critical condition; two other victims were reported to be in stable condition, according to CBS Philadelphia.
The child was found shot in the front seat of the car next to a 29-year-old in critical condition, the station reports.
Two other victims were not in the car, and police are investigating whether any of the wounded men could have been the shooter.
Investigators are reporting to CBS Philadelphia that there was apparently a gunfight between several gunmen.
The gills from the semi-automatic weapon, attributed to different specimens of the semi-automatic weapon, set the scene.
It seems like it was definitely a long battle.
There were blind spots on both sides of the sidewalk.
So it seems there were a few armed fighters and they were actively involved in the shooting", Philadelphia Police Captain Anthony Ginaldy told the station.
Many homes and cars in the area were also damaged.
No arrests have been made, and police are reportedly checking the security cameras.
Another 6-year-old, a girl, was shot in the arm by a bullet Tuesday while playing outside her home in the West Oak Lane neighborhood.
She's recovering, and the police are still looking for the suspect.
Why do we need Simon, Gabby and Lori?
That's what I call this year's Olympic women's gymnastics team, and for a number of reasons.
First, I've been to every Summer Olympics since 1984, and the United States has never been so dominant.
And second, there are three gymnasts who are key to this team: Simone Bails, Gabby Douglas, and Lauren "Lori" Hernandez, who have already inspired so many little girls.
The composition of this collection, supplemented by Eli Reisman, who is Jewish, and Madison Koshan, who is Catholic, makes everyone proud.
This team looks like America at last.
It also reinforced the presence of black and Latin American women at the top of the sport.
For the past four years, the number one female gymnast has been an African-American.
Last year, Simone and Gabby were No. 1 and No. 2.
It's powerful.
At last year's Olympics, Gabby Douglas was an unexpected Olympic champion, and America welcomed her.
Now the world could see the incredible performances of three-time world champion Simone Bales, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez performing unexpected yet virtuous gymnastics exercises.
On Thursday, Simone became the fourth American woman to win gold in the women's individual all-around.
And team mate Ellie Reisman won the silver.
We're seeing the peak of the sport, but it doesn't look like that in gyms across the country.
Simone, Gabby and Lori all chose the same path as Eli and Madison to form an Olympic team.
They're the final five because the next Olympic gymnastics team will have only four gymnasts on the team, and this is the last year of Martha Caroly's coaching.
But in reality, gymnastics is an expensive sport, and gymnasts first train in private gymnastics clubs supported by parents who pay for their education, equipment, travel, form, entrance fees, hotel services (for coaches and their gymnasts and families), and the list goes on.
Most of these gyms are located in affluent suburbs that can support this business.
These clubs are where gymnasts get their training, and that's an expensive and long-term obligation for gymnasts' families.
Amy Burman, coach of Simone Bales, and Maggie Honey, coach of Lori Hernandez, both have been coaching their athletes since they first started gymnastics.
We need to create more affordable, affordable gymnastics training for countless communities of young girls inspired by Simon, Gabby and Lori.
I started my own gymnastics foundation 20 years ago.
In my organizations, we've already provided free and low-cost gymnastics classes in Harlem to more than 15,000 urban youths (mostly black and Latino) and educated national and international champions.
In September, we will expand to Detroit, my hometown, to provide high-quality gymnastics to young people who deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport.
Gymnastics develops strength, flexibility, and coordination for the body, as well as resilience to tiring work, discipline, and persistence for the mind.
This combination has a lifelong positive effect on good health, success at school and work.
It's the inspiration for this team that will send thousands of girls to gymnastics, and that's great.
Sports are so important, especially for girls.
It's such a wonderful time.
Thank you, Simon, Eli, Lori, Gabby and Madison for this serious demonstration of Women's Power in winning team Olympic gold and for motivating so many girls of all backgrounds to be healthy, strong and successful young women.
Young doctors have taken on the call for further strikes after Jeremy Hunt's rejection of the offer.
The ministers hoped to end the debate on the changes by agreeing to the amended treaty with the heads of the British Medical Association, but 58 percent of the 37,000 young doctors who took part in the vote rejected it.
In July, Hunt announced plans to implement the treaty, saying the NHS was in "no man's land" and any subsequent delay would cause damage to staff and patients.
The first junior doctors are transferred to a new contract that includes changes to work at night and weekends to improve service outside of class.
Dr Ellen McCot, chair of the BMA's Young Doctors Committee, said in a statement last night: "Young doctors still have serious concerns about the proposed contract, in particular that it will support the current labour crisis and that it cannot be applied equally to all doctors".
There are only eight weeks left before the first team of doctors is transferred to a new contract, progress is needed, and time is running out.
The US Air Force's attempt to resolve the dispute through negotiations was met with reluctance to act and sometimes complete silence from the government.
And that's despite Jeremy Hunt's promise last month that his door is always open.
"Jeremy Hunt needs to act now, encourage the introduction and respond to the concerns of junior doctors.
If he doesn't, then the junior doctors are clear they're ready to organize the next strike.
The last strike in late April delayed about 13,000 planned operations and 100,000 nursing visits, while nurses and consultants were recruited to ensure replacement of doctors on the picket line.
The ministers hoped to end the dispute by agreeing to the amended treaty with the heads of the British Medical Association.
The WMA wants better pay for the weekends for 54,000 junior doctors who will be covered by the contract.
Daniel Mortimer, CEO of NHS Employers, has urged junior doctors not to continue the strike.
Mortimer stated: "The delays accomplish little or nothing, but put pressure on those already working within the team and services, and cause anxiety, physical pain, and disruption to patients, nurses, and their families".
Over the past two months, we've been talking to the Junior Medical Committee and, in conjunction with the Department of Health and others, responding positively to their concerns about the role of caregivers and corporate information policies.
The staff hoped that continued positive support on other important issues  such as staff allocation, learning flexibility, extra training for those returning after a break in their careers, cost of training, mutual recognition of the curriculum, academic leave and gender pay gaps in medicine  were a sign of how seriously employers, Health Education England and the Department of Health were going to comply with the conditions reached by the WMA in November, February and May.
A £2 a day drug can reduce the risk of heart attack
Thousands of heart attack patients are set to take the drug for £2 a day after authorities recommended it be given to more people and for longer periods.
The anti-inflammatory drug ticagrelor reduces the risk of relapses in people with heart disease.
The drug is already prescribed 12 months after a heart attack, reducing the risk of stroke or a new attack.
The NICE supervision service of the UK's National Health Service has advised people to give it for four years to eliminate the risk of cardiovascular problems.
However, the NICE monitoring service of the UK's National Health Service has advised that people should be given it for four years to avoid the risk of cardiovascular problems.
A heart attack affects about 140,000 people in England each year, and a quarter of them have another attack or stroke.
Heart attacks and strokes occur as a result of the accumulation of fat on the walls of arteries and the formation of plaques.
If the plaque ruptures into pieces, it can cause a clot that blocks blood from reaching the heart and causes a heart attack.
And if the clot moves, it can move through the bloodstream and block the blood flow to the brain, causing a stroke.
People who have had one attack are at higher risk of another.
The tickagrelar, manufactured by British firm AstraZeneca and marketed as Brilique, reduces the risk by making clots less likely.
A draft NICE directive published today recommends that people be given 90 mg of ticagrelor for 12 months, then 60 mg of aspirin twice a day for the next three years.
Professor Carol Longson, director of the NICE Center for Medical Technology Assessment, said: "Despite the fact that there are effective methods of secondary prevention, about a quarter of people who have already had a heart attack have another heart attack or stroke, often with devastating consequences".
Fear of repetition can have a significant negative impact on a person's quality of life.
There is evidence that tickagrelor in combination with aspirin is effective in reducing the risk of subsequent heart attacks and strokes in people who have already had a heart attack.
By recommending ticagrelor beforehand, we are pleased to be able to increase the treatment options available to the many thousands of people who are willing to use it.
Because information on the efficacy and safety of ticagriller  especially the risk of bleeding  after three years is limited, the draft instruction does not recommend treatment longer than this period.
The culture of PC ownership is allowing for the falsification of vote counting in Muslim areas to flourish
Former Tower Hamlets Mayor Lutfur Rahman was removed from office last year for corruption, prompting a government report.
A culture of political correctness has led to blindness, which has resulted in widespread voter fraud in Muslim communities, according to a devastating government report released today.
Former Cabinet Member Sir Eric Pickles has been criticized by police, election observers and city officials for ignoring evidence of election violations because of "excessive sensitivity to race and religion".
The former secretary of local communities, now an anti-corruption czar, said that the religious intimidation of voters was so strong that police should be allowed to put border crossings outside polling stations to protect feared voters.
He suggests that voters take their IDs to prove who they are when they vote.
Right now, all voters have to do is state their name and address.
The report even suggests applying unwashed ink to people's fingers when they hand in their ballots to exclude anyone from having to vote twice.
We need to provide better protection to whistleblowers, Sir Eric said.
He urges the press to have greater access to local council documents and decisions made by informal committees or working groups.
"This is not only to protect against election fraud, but also to protect local government from a more open culture of corruption and financial fraud that goes hand in hand with it", he said.
The report was commissioned by Downing Street following a voting scandal at Tower Hamlets in East London.
Last year, a special court examining election issues ruled that the current mayor, Luftur Rahman, should be removed from office due to a long list of corrupt and illegal activities.
The court found that Rahman "cynically distorted" the religious sentiments of his Muslim community and silenced his critics, accusing them of racism and Islamophobia.
Rahman, as it was said, "led his campaign on the basis that it was the duty of Muslims to vote for him".
Up to 300 votes were questionable or were the result of a characterization when a person votes by posing as someone else.
Sir Eric said there was evidence of fraud across the country.
He expressed particular concern about mail voting fraud, in which senior members of the Muslim community reportedly pressured people to vote for their chosen candidate.
Sir Eric, in the photo, made a number of recommendations to clean up the voting system, including requiring you to bring your ID to prove who you are.
His report said: "There was evidence of pressure being exerted on vulnerable members of some ethnic minority communities, particularly women and youth, to vote at the will of their elders, especially in communities of Pakistani and Bangladeshi origin.
"There was concern that... government agencies had turned a blind eye to such behavior because of the over-sensitivity of "political correctness" regarding ethnicity and religion".
Sir Eric has made 50 recommendations to clean up the system, including removing political activists from using ballot papers to stop "the harvesting of votes".
The report, pending before Theresa May, also calls for stricter registration checks to prevent voter registration being used for immigration and privilege fraud.
The option to require voters to present their identity card before voting is considered.
Use unwashed ink on people's fingers as soon as they drop their ballot to prevent anyone from voting twice.
To conduct systematic national checks to ensure that people have the right to vote.
Three years of automatic mail voting restrictions.
Remove political campaigners and activists from working with full-time voting and postal voting envelopes.
Give the police the authority to set up border controls around polling stations.
Amend the law to make it easier for people to be charged with intimidation under the Representation of the People Act 1983.
Make photographing on polling stations illegal.
Make a requirement that only English be used in the polling stations (except Wales).
Increase training to ensure that staff are making voters go to the polls one by one.
Sir Eric has been fiercely attacking the city police, saying it is "amazing" that no criminal charges have been brought after the Tower Hamlets case.
"The court examining the election issues disqualified Lutfur Rahman and his agent for a long list of corrupt and illegal actions", he said.
He was found guilty of the lack of reasonable doubt  criminal standard of proof  on a number of grounds.
He also criticizes the unsuccessful "checks for the sake of the gallows" of the electoral registration departments of the city administrations.
Sir Eric said: "Last year's ruling in Tower Hamlets was a wake-up call.
Our nation has a proud heritage as the mother of parliamentary elections, and yet the alarming and covert spread of electoral fraud and the denial of some bodies threaten this good reputation.
Crazy for cycling analogy Kate and other celebrity twins at the Rio Olympics
Fans of the 2016 Rio Olympics this week were crazy about French cyclist Pauline Ferran-Prévo, who looks impressively like the Duchess of Cambridge.
But the 24-year-old Olympic athlete is far from the only athlete fighting for gold this summer who can boast her own famous double, at least according to social media posts.
So, in honor of the Rio Games and all the celebrities that are appearing on our screens right now, FEMAIL has compiled a list of Olympians who have more than superficial resemblance to Hollywood stars.
Hunter and wolf: U.S. Archery Team member Brady Allison, left, has been compared to Leonardo DiCaprio since he was a child
In addition to Kate's twin on the bike path, many people online have rushed to point out how a particular archer could be the twin of superstar Leonardo DiCaprio.
U.S. Archery Team member Brady Ellison caused a storm on Twitter after images of him looking terribly like a Wolf Star from Wall Street appeared.
And in fact, the archer learned about the social media craze and admitted that he'd heard that he looked like Leo since he was a kid.
"I personally don't see a huge similarity, maybe except for the vegetation on the face", Brady told the Huffington Post.
"He's an attractive guy, so I think it's a compliment".
One of the most popular comparisons from London 2012 will undoubtedly point to even more this year: the striking similarity between British jumper Greg Rutherford and popular actor Neil Patrick Harris.
Russian gymnast Alia Mustafina, with her large expressive eyes, is said to be the exact copy of Cuban-American singer Gloria Estefan.
And in the South African swimming pool, Cameron Van der Burgh has been compared to the star of the Choir, Matthew Morrison, for many years.
Moving on to something more unexpected: This user believes that Nathan  is the "sporting version" of the "Start" actor
Another long-running comparison was between tennis player Rafael Nadar and actor Josh Harnett, who can boast similar heavy eyebrows and lips.
Silver medalist swimmer Yulia Efimova from Russia can boast not only of her burning skin and light hair like actress AnnaLynn McCord, while U.S. team's Nathan Adrian, according to fans, is similar to "Joseph Gorgon Leavitt's sports version".
The tough women: soccer star Hope Solo, left, and actress Jennifer Carpenter of Dexter, right, have the same face and eyes
Not only that, but one Twitter user was very happy that others saw similarities.
Theory: According to this user, there may be a reason behind the similarity of the pair.
One Twitter user recently went to the site to express his enthusiasm that "the rest of the Internet thinks Hope Solo and Jennifer Carpenter are actually identical".
In fact, the US soccer star and the actress Dexter have incredibly similar facial and eye shapes.
Other popular comparisons included Carrie Walsh Jennings and her smile, which is close to the identical smile of actress Laura Linney, and gold medal-winning gymnast Gabby Douglas, who can boast of her own beautiful broad smile that resembles the smile of "Successful" star Gabriel Union.
CBC Olympic commentator apologizes for saying Chinese swimmer "died like a pig"
The analysis of Byron McDonald fourth place finisher Ay Yanhan 14 years old women's 4x200m freestyle relay has angered the audience of CBC live broadcast of the Olympics
Canadian broadcaster CBC was forced to apologize after one of its commentators said that a 14-year-old Chinese swimmer "started as stinking" and "died like a pig" during the swim.
Commentator Byron McDonald thought his microphone was off when he started expressing his own opinion at the end of the final women's 4x200m freestyle relay.
You could hear McDonald, who was brought on the CBC commentary team to "screw it with color", say, "This 14-year-old Chinese girl threw the ball, baby".
Too excited, started off smelly, died like a pig.
Thank you for that.
Chinese swimmer Ai Yanghan, 14, swam the second leg of the relay in 1:57.79 seconds, 1.61 seconds slower than Canadian Taylor Cancer, allowing the Canadians to overcome their backlog from China.
Viewers across Canada reacted quickly online after being shocked by the tone and expressions used
Emmett McFarlane tweeted, "Did the CBC director actually just say that a 14-year-old Chinese swimmer 'died like a pig'????"
That idiot didn't realize they were still on the air".
About Ai Yanghan of China in the women's 4x200m freestyle final, they said, "This little 14-year-old Chinese girl threw the ball, baby".
Criticism on Twitter immediately hit on Byron McDonald, with many calling for his firing.
Twitter users were furious when they heard how insensitive Byron McDonald was.
Another Twitter user, Sarah Paradise, wrote: 'It's all right #ByronMacDonald.
You represent CBC and Canada and make us look like a bunch of racists. #disgusted.
Shortly thereafter, CBC host Scott Russell apologized live for McDonald's comment, saying, 'We apologize for the comment about the swimming performance being aired.'
It was a bad choice of words, we're sorry it happened.'
The news service concluded by apologizing to more than 90 people who tweeted in response to the statement.
A friend of the commentator , Scott Russell , had to apologize on behalf of McDonald .
CBC then copied and sent their apologies to over 90 other Twitter users who complained about McDonald's comments.
The network has also made a hasty apology and published a statement.
We're very sorry that these statements were made and that they were allowed to go on the air.
Last night, we acted quickly to apologize to our live audience and our social media followers.
Let's be clear, Byron's comments were about the swimmer's performance, not her personality.
And yet it was an inappropriate and unfortunate choice of words, and Byron is very sorry for what he said.
On Thursday afternoon, McDonald apologized in a live broadcast and tried to clarify his comment, saying he did not think his words were being interpreted as an assault on a person.
'I would like to take this moment to apologize for the comment I made last night after the women's relay,' he said on CBC's Olympic broadcast.
'I was talking about the swimmer's performance, not her personally.'
'Of course, there was no disrespect, and I'm very sorry.'
A Primark buyer insulted a woman who shamelessly tried on her underwear in the middle of a store.
Buyers didn't know where to look when a woman went naked to try on her underwear on the floor of a shopping mall in the middle of Primark.
Worse, she tried her way into them, straightened them out, and put them back on the shelf.
She continued her search and ended up measuring four pairs of underwear at Bouverie Place Shopping Center in Folkestone.
Primark Bouverie Place mall in Folkestone, where a woman tried on a pair of knitted underwear before putting them back on the shelf.
Jenny Davidson, a mother of two who was at the store at the time, said that after the underwear was removed, the mysterious woman "dressed again and left the store without buying anything".
She said, "People could not believe what they saw".
Standing in the middle of the mall, she took a pair of panties from the window, took off her own panties and underwear and put them on.
"She didn't try to find a hiding place to do it  she just stood there, shameless".
"Everybody was upset when she took off her panties again, and she clearly didn't like them because she put them back on the shelf".
She did the same thing to three other couples before finally deciding that there was nothing she liked here, dressing up again and leaving.
"She didn't seem to care who was watching her, or that she thought about the person who would eventually buy those underwear she was trying".
Jenny Davidson, 33, of Kent, said: "It's disgusting to think that someone is going to take home underwear that someone else has already worn and hasn't washed".
The incident happened Tuesday afternoon.
Davidson added: "I conclude that the staff apparently tried to remove these items of clothing from the sale after she left, and it was all the better".
"I wouldn't want to come home with a new pair of women's underwear and find that another woman wore them and took them off and they weren't washed".
A Primark spokesman said: "Primark is aware of the incident that occurred at our store in Folkestone on Tuesday, August 9th".
All the goods in question have been withdrawn from sale.
How to Protect Yourself From Gun Attacks With a Claw-Maga
The world around you is dangerous, but this video from Dailymail.com might help make it a little bit safer for you.
We spoke to Ron Mizrachi, the master of the New York Stock Exchange Federation, to figure out how to deal with armed robbers at close range.
Whether they come in front of you or behind you, this video will show you how to beat a robber with his own weapon.
If they come from behind, Mizrachi says, the first thing you need to do is turn around so you can see the attacker and "liberate the line of fire".
Then you squeeze the gun tightly between your forearm and shoulder before hitting them in the face with your elbows free.
Then the knee is in a growl, and while the attacker bends out of pain, you twist the gun out of his hands, hit him in the face with a barrel, and back off, holding the gun against him.
For a forward-armed man, the way to do it is to remove your body from the line of fire, quickly grab the gun and twist it so that the villain cannot shoot.
At the same time, move the weight to the gun and punch the attacker in the chest, then pull the gun out of his grip before pulling back and aiming at him.
Does that sound complicated?
Watch the video to see exactly how Mizrachi does it.
But remember, the safest way out of any robbery if you're not a cow-mag master is to give up your cash.
For the travel guide , traveler Jan Wright spends his language in Europe 's dirtiest places
A British traveler put his immune system and vomiting reflex to the test, licking some of the dirtiest and most disgusting places in Europe.
Travel book host and author Jan Wright, 51, from Suffolk, has used the language of the euro banknote, the tracks of the Circus Piccadilly, the toilet button on a train and the Russian public phone to prove his immune system.
Before he swallowed any object, he used a luminometer to show himself and us what he was getting into.
But the experiment, which was to become a movie called The Lion Traveler's Guide to the Force Within, produced some amazing results.
The thought of licking a wash button on a train that thousands of others use may be extremely disgusting, but there are actually worse bacteria in the kitchen sink.
Throughout his trip around Europe, Wright talked to doctors and nurses about boosting gut bacteria and his own health.
Fortunately, nothing from the licking brought him more than bad taste in his mouth.
Wright became famous for testing his gut strength, traveling the world and eating strange and amazing things.
From the public railings at the train station to the toilet button, this task has undoubtedly tested his immune system.
In the film he made, he said, 'From childhood I was completely unconcerned with my health and I pulled a lot of different things out of my mouth, eating worms and dirty water.'
He certainly proved his reputation during the film.
The only thing he refused was a dirty Russian public toilet.
His sample sample showed a luminometer value of more than 4,000 units.
For comparison, the hands that have just been washed must be within 60.
But there was one Russian public toilet that he refused to lick after his luminometer value was over 4,000 units, while just washed hands showed less than 60.
Wright and Finnish dairy company Valio have made a film about a traveler called "The Lion-Traveller's Guide to the Force Within", which shows the number of bacteria in different places, such as the toilet.
In the film, he reported, 'It's close to one of the worst things I've ever smelled in a toilet.'
There's nothing dirtier than that!
I'm not gonna lick anything because it's disgusting.
"Lison Traveler's Guide to the Force Within" was filmed with Finnish dairy manufacturer Valio.
The company provided Wright with Valio Gefilus, which contains acidic milk bacteria, as well as vitamins C and D to help accelerate the growth of human gut bacteria and develop the immune system.
Nico Vuorenmaa, Valio's senior vice president for snacks, juices and new categories, said: 'We really wanted to offer consumers something new.
What would be interesting to see and at the same time explain the benefits of probiotics.
We had a brainstorming that ended with the idea of "let's call Jan".
They say that interest in gut health is becoming a global phenomenon.
Instead of just talking about foods, we wanted to put them in a larger context: the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment, the importance of gut health and how it's connected to the immune system.
The growing interest in gut health is a global phenomenon, and with this documentary, we were able to present more information to consumers about it in an interesting way.
I also think the movie shows that we have a good sense of humor!
Tom Huckalal, who directed the film, added: 'Let's say I would lose respect for Jan if he swallowed some of the things I asked for, like the disgusting Russian toilet shown in the film.'
Of course, some things were easier for Jan to swallow, and some were quite hard.
I'm glad we were able to film some of these licks.'
In a 2015 Valio poll, 84 percent of respondents linked acid-lactin bacteria to the health of their stomach and intestines, and 58 percent said they ate at least occasionally foods containing added acid-lactin bacteria.
The family of the hooligans destroyed the Saltach, the Cornwall municipal house, on the eve of eviction
The family of the hooligans left their municipal home with £50,000 in damages after they were evicted for intimidating their neighbors.
Tanu Skeldon and her partner Sean Trebilcock were evicted from their property in Saltash, Cornwall, after a long list of complaints against them.
After they were forced out of the property, shocked housing co-operatives officials discovered the property in a state of repair.
The walls were left with gaping holes, half were opened, garbage was scattered on the floor and the walls were graffiti-packed.
The family is now resettled and is believed to be living in a private apartment.
Donna McEvoy, a resident at Cornwall Housing, said she was afraid he wouldn't be rescued.
She said, 'It was a total nightmare for the people here, and I don't think people should live like that.
There's a lot to consider because this property is likely to be known as not a very good Cornwall aspect.
This family is badly known, and their name is badly known.
The couple had three sons who lived in the property from time to time, and police report that the reign of terror caused by the family included street fights with baseball bats, intimidation of neighbors, drug use, drug trafficking, excessive screaming, quarreling and slander.
Skeldon, 47, whose name was on the lease, received a warrant for antisocial behavior in June.
Several rooms in the house, which could be torn down, found old garbage.
Floor boards in a house that used to sell drugs have been removed
Neighbors say they saw street fights and regularly called the police.
Cornwall Housing forced her and her partner out of their home this week after they were granted an extended period of 11 weeks to voluntarily leave.
The eviction was greeted with relief by neighbors who said their lives had been turned into a real hell.
One said, 'They didn't care.'
We lived next door to them for 20 years, and it was always bad.
The number of times we've seen the police here is incredible.
'We couldn't sleep this morning.'
We got up because it was so quiet here - we weren't used to it!
Now that they're finally gone, everything will be fine.
Adam Fitzpatrick, head of the Cornwall Housing Neighbourhood Group, said the family was unable to cooperate with local authorities.
The family lived in the house for 20 years, with the police, and the police were called regularly.
Garbage and old toys were dumped down the side of the townhouse
He added: 'It is a shame that the tenant could not accept any responsibility for her and her family's behaviour, as eviction is always the last course of action that Cornwall Housing considers.
It was a very difficult case, because the behavior was very limited, and their actions must have been terrifying to her observing neighbors.
I appreciate all the work my team, the police and the Devon and Cornwall community have done to give us the information.
I hope this development will give some comfort to the neighbors and send a signal that unsociable behavior will not be allowed.
Fitzpatrick said all three sons lived in the house at different times, but he said they were all a little over 20 at the time.
A dirty mattress left on the floor in one of the bedrooms after being evicted.
The settlement workers will now have to remove the garbage pile that surrounds the house.
In 2014, police searched the house and found over 70 grams of cannabis, as well as weights, corresponding belongings and £1,700 in cash.
Skeldon was fined after pleading guilty to possession of Class B drugs for delivery.
She said the money was going to pay for the funeral for her son, Lee Skeldon, who died in a car crash in 2013.
After being made homeless, there are reports that Tanya and her partner are now living in Plymouth.
The walls of many rooms in the house were graffiti-painted all over the surface.
Police say they'll try to evict tenants who don't follow the rules of the rental.
Angela Crow, of Devon and Cornwall Police, said the eviction sent a clear warning to other tenants who continue to break the rules.
'This is a message for those who feel they can behave without the prosecution's accusations, as well as those who are harmed by such behaviour,' she said.
Criminal and anti-social behaviour will never be tolerated by Devon and Cornwall Police who will continue to work with partners to protect our communities.
Tourists in Portugal were horrified when a low-flying military plane nearly touched the beach
In Aveiro, Portugal, tourists who enjoy sunbathing feared for their lives
The P-3C Orion aircraft of the Portuguese Air Force flew incredibly low.
The Air Force said he was on a training flight, but insisted there was no safety risk.
This is the moment when the frightened tourists start to panic, while the moment when the plane is flying over a crowded beach.
The dramatic footage shows a military aircraft flying almost a touch away from hunters on a sand bar in Aveiro, northern Portugal.
The resting guests would jump on their feet as soon as they became, for obvious reasons, concerned about the noise of the aircraft's engines, but not being able to see what was moving towards them through the clouds.
The incident happened last night near the town of Aveiro in Costa Nova.
Daniel Fernandez, one of the few vacationers who posted a shocking video of the crash on social media, said: "It flew very low twice, and there was a moment, at some point, it seemed like it was going to break".
Nuno Arroja added: "I was surfing and I swear, it felt like the plane was about to crash on me".
Tourists on Aveiro Beach were terrified when the plane emerged from the fog and flew at an extremely low altitude
The Portuguese Air Force said today that the pilot of the P-3C Orion was on a training flight to spot fishing vessels on shore and was forced to descend so low as it was the only way to test them.
The pilot said the plane flew slightly lower than normal due to insufficient visibility caused by smoke from nearby burning forests, but the Air Force insisted that no one was in danger.
This summer, forest fires damaged the mainland of Portugal and killed four people on the island of Madeira.
The Portuguese Air Force made a statement today that the pilot had to fly so low due to the circumstances of the thick fog and fog from the forest fires that have made the visibility worse.
The plane was on a training flight, and the pilot was tasked with finding fishing boats as part of the mission.
The HASSP system has been mandatory for the general public for more than a year, but most of St. Petersburg's cafes and restaurants have not yet implemented it.
The checks are getting more active, and the business is threatened with fines of up to 1 million rubles.
For more than a year now, the Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points (HACCP) system - risk analysis and critical control points - has been mandatory for food manufacturers and carriers, as well as companies in the foodservice sector in Russia as a member of the Customs Union (CB).
The inspection of the business by the Rospotrebnadzor for compliance with these standards in St. Petersburg began in February 2015.
But officials are only issuing fines for certain violations of the regulations (see "List of documents"...).
Failure to comply with the regulation will cost the enterprise 600 thousand rubles for the first violation and 1 million rubles for the second.
HACCP as a system for taking risks into account and preventing food was invented in the United States in the 1960s.
It was about food safety for astronauts.
Now, the system is used in all food businesses not only in the US, but also in Canada and the European Union.
Since February 2015, the HASSP has been operating in the territory of the Republic of Kazakhstan.
The business has 4 years to develop and implement the system (the demand for the HASSP appeared in the technical regulation of the TC in 2011).
However, both businessmen and officials admit that most companies have never even heard of this rule.
Unfortunately, we have long been convinced that the norm only applies to food production, not restaurants", explained the head of the Public Council, Elena Ceresteli.
Now everyone's trying to make up for lost time.
The expected period for the resumption of charter flights to Turkey is late August - early September.
But they will not be in high demand, as their target audience - families with children - are already preparing for school, experts say.
The Alliance of Travel Agencies sent a letter to the government yesterday asking for a charter now.
"For many Russian tourists, the question of choosing a quality and affordable sea holiday is unresolvable, as most accommodation facilities are already booked until the end of September at the resorts of Krasnodar Territory and the Republic of Crimea", the authors of the letter note and emphasize that the opening of charter transportation in August will not significantly affect the demand for Russian sea tour products.
According to the Northwest Regional Branch of the Russian Tourism Industry Union (RST), if the Russian and Turkish aviation departments quickly agree, charter flights to Turkey can be resumed within a month.
The clear understanding of when charters will be renewed, as yet, depends primarily on the aviation authorities.
Technically, the planes can fly in September, even in August, if the tour operators quickly develop programs and agree with the airlines on the necessary boarding directions", says Pavel Rumyantsov, deputy director for communications and international projects of the North-West Regional Branch of the RST.
He said the potential renewal of charters is good news, but it won't affect the market as much as it does, because the main customers of charter tours - families with children - have already returned from vacation and are preparing for school or are on holiday in other countries.
In the turtle season, tourists and couples buy tours mostly by themselves.
Charter programs can be designed for those who can take a spontaneous break", says Pavel Romyantsov.
"Turkey has a chance to attract many tourists if it offers very budgetary offers - 50 to 60 thousand rubles per tour for two, because there are people who are deliberately waiting for very cheap tours", says Valeria Rosenthal, CEO of Optio-Travel.
Otherwise, you can't expect a lot of excitement - the majority of the trip is already planned.
Pavel Romyantsov also believes that since there is demand for regular flights to Turkey, charters will also be in demand, but the hype should not be expected.
"For Turkey, the launch of charters now is a rehearsal for next season", says Pavel Romyantsov.
"The opening of charters in Turkey is a positive news for the next season", - agrees Valery Rubtsov.
The tax code provides for the exemption from the NDFL of compensation payments established by law within the limits of the approved norms related to compensation for damage caused by injury or other damage to health.
The provision of milk to workers engaged in work with harmful working conditions is provided for in Article 222 of the Russian Civil Code.
The rules and conditions of extradition are set by the order of the Ministry of Health and Social Development of Russia dated 16.02.2009 No 45n.
According to this document, the free delivery of milk or other equivalent food products is made to workers on days of actual employment in jobs with harmful working conditions, due to the presence of harmful production factors in the workplace.
Based on these norms, the Russian Federal Tax Service in the letter in question concluded that on the basis of the paragraph 2 of the 3rd paragraph of Article 217 of the Russian Federation NRC, income in the form of milk value given to employees on days of actual employment in jobs with harmful working conditions is exempt from NDPFL taxation in accordance with the Norms and conditions approved by the order of the Ministry of Health and Social Development of Russia dated 16.02.2009 No. 45n.
Moscow's Gazstroybank has been left without a license from the Central Bank.
On Friday, August 12, 2016, the Central Bank of Russia revoked the license to carry out banking operations from the Aktionalized Commercial Bank "GazSTROYBANK", a credit organization registered in Moscow.
According to the regulator, the GAZSTROYBANK ACB has a high-risk credit policy related to placing money in low-quality assets.
Adequate assessment of the risks taken at the request of the supervisory authority and reliable reflection of the value of the bank's assets have led to the emergence of grounds for the implementation of measures to prevent bankruptcy in the credit organization.
In addition, the credit organization was involved in conducting questionable transit operations.
The bank has a temporary administration for the period of validity until the appointment of the competitive manager or liquidator.
The powers of the executive bodies of the credit organization are suspended in accordance with federal laws.
GAZSTROYBANK is a member of the deposit insurance system.
It is worth mentioning that the payment of insurance compensation to bank depositors, including individual entrepreneurs, in accordance with Federal Law No 177-FZ "On insurance of deposits of individuals in banks of the Russian Federation" is provided in the amount of 100% of the balance of funds, but not more than 1,4 million rubles in total per one depositor.
The deposit insurance agency said payments would begin no later than August 26, 2016.
According to the report, the assets of the AKB "GazSTROYBANK" on 1 August 2016 were 335th in the banking system of the Russian Federation.
London school girl who joined ISIS killed in Syria
Kadisa Sultan, one of three British schoolchildren who left London last year to join ISIS, reportedly died in Syria.
Attorney Tasnim Akunji said her family learned of her death in Raqqa, Syria, a few weeks ago.
She is believed to have died in a Russian airstrike in Raqqa, the country's stronghold, ITV News reported on Thursday.
The Sultan was 17 years old, and according to her family, she died just as she was planning to leave the war-torn country and return to England.
"One can only hope that the only benefit of all this - like a tombstone and a will to others, that these are the same risks that are being discussed when traveling to a war zone - is to discourage people from ever making the same choice", Akunji said.
In February 2015, Sultan and two other school girls from east London boarded a plane to Turkey and then a bus to the Syrian border.
The Sultan's family said she married an ISIS fighter in Syria and became a widow within months.
Reed says Clinton will remain loyal to Garland as a candidate for the Supreme Court if elected.
Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid says he believes that the Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton will nominate Justice Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court if she is elected president.
Senate Republicans blocked Garland's confirmation, as President Barack Obama nominated him in March.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell says the next president will choose the man who can replace the last Supreme Court Justice, Antonin Scalia.
Reed said on a conference call Thursday that he predicted Clinton would pick Garland "with some degree of confidence".
Rep. Reed later said he hadn't spoken to Clinton directly about whether she would nominate Garland, and was just making assumptions.
He praised Garland and said the Clinton team wouldn't want to "slide the boat" with a new choice.
Garland is the chief judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia.
Reed said the Republicans who block Garland's nomination are "tailors" and "assistants" to Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump.
He said Trump wasn't fit for the job.
Treats states that erotic calendars for 'women are as much for men'
Treats is collaborating with photographer David Bellmer to release a 2017 calendar inspired by Pirelli's 1970s.
But instead of being naked celebrities, they're aiming to find the next generation of top models for their 2017 calendar with naked muses.
Treats president Steve Shaw told us earlier this year that his magazine with a lot of nude models is different from old-fashioned Playboy because "Playboy is for men".
I make it for women.
He obviously thinks the calendar is too.
"We need to get back to the show of the eternal and classic nude figure, where women, like men, feel comfortable and inspired by these images of the female body", Shaw said in a press release announcing the calendar.
Women will want to be part of this project because it's a beautiful work of art.
Models can submit photos online or in person at open castings in Los Angeles and New York.
The Moscowers will be handed souvenirs of unfaithful online stores.
In Moscow, they're going to release a memorial to tell you how not to become a victim of an online store.
This was reported in Rospotrebnadzor, writes M24.
The department is preparing a memorial to help citizens choose the right online store and identify possible fraud schemes.
The concept of this brochure includes several sections.
It'll be a general information and a legal framework, rules for the delivery of goods, ways to protect your legal rights.
The application will give recommendations on how to make a claim correctly and so on", - said the Rospotrebnazore.
The memorial is being worked on.
It will be posted on the website of the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Moscow, and is also planned to be published in print and distributed to the Moscow people.
The Russian Foreign Ministry published a statement naming the name of the second suspect in organizing the diversion in Crimea.
People from the citizens of Ukraine and Russia who assisted in the preparation of terrorist acts were detained.
Among them are Panov, Eugene Alexanderovich and Zakhtay Andrei Romanovich.
"They all give a confession", the report said.
Earlier, Zaporizhzhya region resident Evgeny Panov, who was arrested on suspicion of organizing terrorist attacks in Crimea, pleaded guilty to the charges.
FAS will fine Google with 438 million rubles.
The Federal antitrust service of Russia (FAS) has imposed an administrative fine on Google in the amount of 438 million rubles, the agency said on its website.
"The fine for Google for violating the anti-monopoly legislation was 438 million rubles.
We hope that the company will implement our decision and pay the fine in the near future", - said Deputy Head of FAS Alexey Dotenko.
During the investigation, FAS determined that Google supplies the Google Play app store to smartphone manufacturers who sell in Russia only on the condition that other corporate applications are installed on the device.
Among these applications is a search engine that should be on the smartphone's home screen.
Thus, the corporation violates section 1 of article 10 of the Federal Law "On Competition Protection" (abuse of the dominant position).
We are confident that the implementation of the directive will provide an opportunity for the development of competition in the mobile software market in Russia, which will have a positive impact on our consumers.
The Law "On the Protection of Competition" must be observed by all companies whose products are delivered to the territory of the Russian Federation, and transnational corporations including", - said the head of the FAS Regulatory and Information Technology Office of Russia Elena Zaeva.
The agency suspects 16 Russian shops in the conspiracy.
The New Book Network was fined for selling the book "50 Days Before My Suicide".
The New Bookstore chain has been fined for selling the book "50 days before I committed suicide", reports Moscow City News Agency.
According to the Rospotrebnadzor, without specifying the amount of the fine, the text of the book can be considered as "provoking or motivating to suicidal behavior of children and adolescents".
The Ostanka district court confirmed the violation of the established requirements for the distribution of information products among children and ordered a fine with the confiscation of 49 copies of printed products, arrested by the Rospotrebnadzor management.
A source in the New Book confirmed that it was a work by Stace Kramer.
In March of this year, it was reported that the largest bookstores in Moscow were checking for the book "50 Days Before My Suicide".
There will be a memorial night in Moscow for Ernst the Unknown.
In Moscow, the sculptor Ernst Unknown will be remembered.
The event will be held on August 15 at the Central House of Literature.
Unfortunately, not everyone in the United States will be able to say goodbye to the Unknown personally.
Therefore, it was decided to organize this evening for those who want to remember him in their homeland", the press service of the Russian Jewish Congress said.
It noted that this was important to the widow of sculptor Anna Graham and his friends around the world.
The evening was attended by the friends of the Unknown, including the poet Eugene Yevtuchenko, artist Boris Messserer, President of the Pushkin Institute of Technology, Irina Antonova, director Mark Rosovsky, as well as Russian culture minister Vladimir Medinsky, head of the Moscow culture department Alexander Kiбовsky, Moscow mayor's deputy Leonid Pechatnikov.
Earlier, it was reported that the relatives of Ernst Unknown are planning a sculptor's funeral in New York, presumably until August 14.
The end consumer asked, "Who's actually buying the records?"
Single middle-aged men like wine.
And until you've been able to fill the comments section with a rude insult under the alias of Not All Single Men, this claim is based on actual evidence.
According to YouGov, the revival of the plates is not due to the booming millennial generation seeking to get into the new material, but rather to the nostalgia of middle age.
Those who recently bought a vinyl album are more likely to be between the ages of 45 and 54, according to the data.
Moreover, those in the 18-24 age group are less likely.
It 's also not just an act of collecting by amateurs - it 's emotional: older vinyl buyers are a little more likely to keep their feelings to themselves (56 percent vs. 53 percent) and enjoy being alone (69 percent vs. 66 percent).
But are YouGov's results true?
If this blog were a TV news story, the camera would follow me as I walk down the middle of Soho Street in a busy, modest gray suit and make a big gesture before the stop, folding my hands and saying something impressive like, "Well, let's see".
All right, let's see.
While Soho's heart is slowly losing its charm and dirt  hotels, cafes, Paperchase shops are now filled with buildings, once occupied by independent sellers  a few music shops with fantastic specialists still remain.
I'd probably ask the camera to stop for the next scene, where I'm close to different people in some of these stores and trying to assess their age and emotional mood by observation.
A native of Glasgow, 55 years old, I followed from Sister Ray (data count: two young women, three middle-aged men) to Reckless Records (data count: eight middle-aged men, one woman probably over 20), in London for a half day to hold a meeting, and walks around the shops to take a few hours.
Is he a collector, I ask?
"I suppose so", he says.
I have about 3,000 or 4,000 plates.
These records pictured above (he emailed me pictures, I didn't follow him home) run lines along the walls of his living room.
His reason for buying so many albums and singles is partly because of his disposable income: he can now buy records he couldn't afford when they first came out, and buy back items he sold when he was young and broke.
"A lot of what I buy is late '60s, early '70s, stuff that came out when I was 11 or 12, stuff that I was probably too young to buy", he says.
He agrees that those who buy records are likely introverts who like their own company, adding, "I don't smoke, I don't drink a lot.
That's my fault.
Wes, 25, who works for Sister Ray, also believes that many of the clients he meets match the YouGov profile.
He did, however, notice a new wave of people being influenced by the media buzz, people who heard about the return and felt obliged to buy their old records.
So, from what I've been talking about, people got rid of their collection, usually around 1998 or 1999.
Customers who once sold their vinyl to buy CDs are now selling their CDs to buy their records",  he says.
This may explain the boom in the vinyl revival of a certain age.
What about the supposed emotional importance of the plates?
You just need to spend a few seconds in a store like Phonica to realize that record stores offer a comfortable community for like-minded people.
According to Wes, some of the older customers, in particular, are offended by the cashless payment system.
Some vinyl enthusiasts may feel the shock of the digital world and prefer to go to the permanent familiar envelopes for vinyl records, items that evoke memories of quiet youth.
"I think sometimes it can be filling an emptiness or possessing material things as a kind of comfort", says Wes.
As a collector myself, I have it, and I think a lot of people have it.
It's a simple way to get your head in the way.
"We're like their social workers!" said a colleague from the plate shelf.
An ICM poll in April found that nearly 50 percent of people who bought a vinyl album last month had not yet listened to it.
The survey also found that 41 percent of people have a player they never use, while 7 percent of people who buy vinyl don't have a record player.
At this point in the news, I would probably look seriously puzzled, leafy on a rack with Bosanov's collections.
The "trophy" aspect of revival is what Johnny, 42, who works at Sounds of the Universe, observed.
"Somebody came up recently and said, 'I don't have a record player, but I want to buy a Radiohead record so we can put it on the shelf,'" he says.
It's not a big percentage, but it certainly happens.
More of the ingredients, less of the music.
We have people who say, "I don't have a record player".
They're younger people, not older people, a little under 20, who are just getting used to it.
Fopp, who's now moved almost the entire floor to vinyl, has a much more diverse audience when I come.
There are couples in their 70s, tourists who take pictures, teenage boys and middle-aged women.
Although less casual than the aforementioned stores, the latest synth and sexy pop Wild Beast, rather than jazz improvisation, is breaking through the columns.
None of them seem particularly lonely, but painful psychological trauma is hard to pin down by standing around for 30 seconds.
Eleanor, 27, walked around Fopp for a few minutes, looking at the various records available for sale.
She's looking at the goods, not spending the money.
She doesn't make much money, she says, so collecting records isn't a very good option.
It's expensive.
Listening to music on a computer or other device is easy, but the beauty of vinyl is"... she plunges into dreams with a breath of love.
I don't know how to explain this. It's really unique.
My last stop is the store that is said to have helped create a new generation of vinyl lovers: Urban Fashion.
While I create the illusion of looking at jeans-like shorts, I watch a group of teenage girls gather around the Polaroid camera every minute before a father and his daughter start discussing buying a Crosley player.
On the left is a staircase with a wall of Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mix of modern and classic styles, a must-have for any mid-sized collection.
No one looks at them  maybe because they're just jewelry, some are so high on the wall that it would be impossible to touch them.
This is a real art vinyl.
But given that any attention to these items could mean more money for the industry and send a few more customers to the Soho depths for a while longer, there's hardly anything to complain about.
It's no wonder that the population that is more likely than most to have more time and money than most is the one that spends most of its money on luxury items like vinyl.
But while my findings suggest that YouGov's findings are accurate, at least in Soho record stores, they do not rule out the existence of a huge number of female collectors and vinyl amateurs who exist in reality, in record stores and online forums.
These people probably work in schools or offices.
But they obviously don't spend Thursday mornings walking around the record stores on Berwick Street, scrubbing the records and avoiding the looks of an unpleasant 30-year-old fake host who hangs over the shoulders of unsuspecting middle-aged men.
Greenland's polar shark is the longest-lived vertebrate animal in the world
Scientists claim that the Greenland polar shark has the longest life span of any vertebrate on the planet.
Julius Nielsen, who studies these sharks, claims that a female is 272 to 512 years old and 5 meters long.
French court rejects the offer to demolish shops in Jungle refugee camp
A French court rejected the proposal by the authorities of Calais to demolish dozens of self-made shops and restaurants in the jungle camp, where thousands of refugees live.
At court hearings this week, the authorities in Calais said the state should be able to demolish a total of 72 homemade shops where people inside the camp sell goods, from cigarettes to energy drinks, offer to shave or sell tea for 50 cents (40p) or the simplest dishes for a few euros in homemade restaurants.
Kale Prefecture said these places should be demolished because they represent a parallel economy that pays no taxes and because they carry fire and sanitation risks.
The humanitarian groups told the court that shops and restaurants were vital, stating that the free meals offered by the pro-government association and other groups did not provide enough food for the growing number in the camp.
They said that homemade shops and restaurants often provide shelter and free food for those in need.
Lille's court ruled that there was no legal basis for firing people who ran 72 self-made stores, but stated that the problems of Calais Prefecture "were fully understood".
Judge Jean-François Molla said that bakeries, cafes, and restaurants played a much larger role than simply feeding people who "live in extremely fragile conditions".
He said the spaces provided quiet meeting points for refugees and volunteers.
One of the places that was threatened with demolition was the Jungle Book Children's Cafe at the camp, which is a not-for-profit organization that offers 200 lunches a day, English and French classes, and counseling on how to provide shelter to hundreds of vulnerable minors without escort in the camp.
More than 170,000 people signed a petition to protect the children's cafe.
A letter to the Guardian said that its closure "would be a disaster for these children, some of whom are under eight".
Two charities, Refugee Aid and L'Auberge des Migrants on Friday estimated that the number of people in the Jungle camp had risen to more than 9,000, the highest ever, after a sharp increase in new arrivals during the summer.
The library of the neighborhood invites young inmates to the educational programs.
This week, the library-branches will hold meetings dedicated to the City Day, the Year of Russian Cinema and even the Day of the Physical Artist.
The programmes are aimed at children, so most of them will be in playful form.
Today, August 10, library branch No. 2, in the Bay Area, invites you to a cruise-presentation of "My Little Town".
On August 11, the library-branch No. 1 will host the "I live in this city, I know this city" landscape lessons.
In the library-branch No. 2, the same day, a multimedia lesson "The land of the native past destiny" will be held.
And in the library-branch No 4 in Suradzevka - the game program "Film, film, film".
On Sunday, August 14, the library-branch No. 3 will host a game program for kids from the northern neighborhood "Fizcult-hello!".
Britain stops silver in rugby sevens after Fiji's master class allows them to take gold
Britain's impressive rugby sevens series was crushingly halted by the final hurdle by Fiji in the final on Thursday night when they were completely beaten 43-7 at the Deodoro Stadium here in Rio.
Fiji gave a masterclass in ball possession, scoring, dodging, game support, running lines and rugby to win their first Olympic gold medal of any color.
The defeat came with not too poor consolation in the form of a silver  third for Britain in a day  and they could be proud of their efforts in the first Rugby-7 Olympic tournament, which they beat New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa on the way.
A painful beating by the Boks, 7-5 in the semi-final earlier that day, could come back to negatively impact them in the final.
But despite everything, Fiji in this form won as well as they could for a team of 15 men.
It may be a bit of a comfort to the UK  but it's probably not  that at least one Briton will be wearing a gold medal tomorrow: Fiji's head coach, Ben Ryan, former England boss from Wimbledon.
It was a bit of a journey for Britain.
Eight years ago, under Ryan, they lost every game at the Adelaide Sevens.
They've lost only one.
These strikes will hurt, but progress is staggering.
Fiji got off to a great start, playing back to Britain's attempt to catch the ball.
It was like running into a column of buses for Captain Tom Mitchell and his company, and the World Series champions went up 5-0, when Osea Collinesau jumped into the corner.
With four minutes left on the clock, Jerry Tuvai added another touchdown on the right flank, which was accomplished.
12-0 and Great Britain barely touched the ball.
Mitchell's brilliant interception attempt kept mountain man Leon Nakarav from scoring a third, but it only kept Fiji behind.
In the seventh minute, Jas Veremaluas scored a touchdown in the right corner, and Great Britain lost 17-0.
Nakarawa added another one after the resumption and the clock was still more than a minute... in the first half.
Vato Ravovo then broke through several more lazy attempts to intercept Britain and stormed the line to get a point.
The performance led to a 29-0 lead in the break.
It looked as if Fiji were born to play rugby sevens, while Britain was still a master of the craft.
Which is pretty much the case.
Great Britain was making massive substitutions in the half, and they blocked the Fijian dam... for all four minutes, which by the standards of the first half was good, until Joshua Tuisov passed after a few brilliant Fijian interactions.
Dan Norton grabbed the attempt for Great Britain by scoring a touchdown in the left corner to make the score 36-7, but the game had long been on the way to the South Sea Islanders, whose fans sang, waved flags and danced in the stands.
I couldn't help but admire Fiji's joyful approach.
Mata William decorated the Fiji cake, which didn't need decoration, another last-minute attempt.
The whistle rang, the Fijians hugged, and Britain fell to the ground, completely defeated.
Earlier that day Fiji beat Japan 20-5 in their semi-final, and Britain slightly outperformed South Africa in a tense one-way semi-final.
Kyle Brown leads the Boks in the first half, but Dan Norton, with some great leg work, broke the line and scored under the bat in the second half.
The brilliant last interception attempt from Marcus Watson, the brother of England's 15-man side, Anthony, ensured the win  and ultimately the silver medal.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning are inspired to win the rowing match by a trainer battling cancer
There won't be any more exciting gold at these games, and that says something.
From the first move to the last, 220 heavy climbs into history, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found the added value of their golden moment at the Estacio da Lagoa.
Although they were the two who pulled the oars, there were three voices in that boat, the echo of coach Robin Williams was always there as they were seeking their second consecutive Olympic gold in women's pairs, the first women in the annals of British sport to reach this height.
Their superiority was absolute, after all, it was their 39th unbeaten performance, again unprecedented.
As we can see, two brilliant female athletes sliding on the surface with swan elegance do not fully reflect the nature of triumph.
Behind every gold was a battalion of ready-made hands that contributed to gradually increasing victories that mattered, and there was no hand that played a more important role than the hands of a coach who 30 months ago, when he was diagnosed with cancer, didn't know if he would live to see that day.
Like he said, it was a dangerous case.
I had bladder cancer, which is one of the things they can operate on, and they did.
If they don't, it goes everywhere.
It could have been a pretty bad situation.
It changes your vision for the future a little bit.
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.
The trio was lucky to start treatment in early 2014 in the offseason, keeping the schedule gap to a minimum if that could be the right expression in circumstances like this.
I needed a payment, so I needed to get better quickly.
It was a stimulus.
I was in the hospital and I walked 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet at a time, even though they said a few steps was enough.
That's how it starts.
Roofing itself is a journey, but it makes it a little bit more.
The next moment after the victory, their first thoughts were of Williams, who spent a nervous morning talking a little more than usual, trying to overcome his own experiences.
Stanning, a captain in the artillery regiment with a tour of duty in Afghanistan, said, "I was emotionally devastated this week, maybe a little overwhelmed, but it means so much".
It just confirms how much this means to me, how much Helen and I worked, and so did Robin.
It's been a fantastic three years with Helen and Robin.
Without Robin, we'd be nothing, so thank you so much, he's the best coach in the world.
I couldn't ask for the best partner for training or the best coach.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning haven't lost a race in five years.
This couple sets a tense rhythm that their competitors could never match.
Even in the last 500 metres, as the New Zealand and Denmark teams began to approach, Stanning and Glover had too much in store.
We were in a very tight spot.
Helen called, "Stay in the process, stay in the process".
It's important to stay out of it.
We got off to a great start, and at the same time, we didn't try to do anything amazing.
We weren't expecting fireworks today, we were just expecting to be able to do a good job of shaving and go out and win this race, which we did.
It'll take a couple a year to decide their future.
Glover needs to be at her wedding next month, her own with TV adventure hunter Steve Bexshall.
Now she just wants to enjoy the moment.
I didn't mean to say it was my last race.
That would mean too much pressure.
It took me about six months in London to realize I was an Olympic champion.
It was so new, and I was so stressed.
It took about four minutes.
I feel so much better", she said.
The government extended the deadline for the destruction of sanctioned products
The government extended the period of destruction of food products banned from importing into Russia until the end of 2017.
The relevant resolution was signed by Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev, and published on the official portal of legal information.
The embargo against countries that have imposed anti-Russian sanctions due to the situation in Ukraine was introduced in our country in August 2014.
The ban was extended several times, now it is in effect until December 31, 2017.
It is forbidden to import certain types of agricultural products, raw materials and foodstuffs from the United States, European Union countries, Canada, Australia, Norway, Ukraine, Albania, Montenegro, Iceland and Liechtenstein.
In particular, meat and meat products, fish, seafood, vegetables, fruits and dairy products were banned.
The use of food imported into the country to circumvent the embargo has been carried out in Russia since August 2015.
In the first quarter of 2016 alone, about 100 tons of prohibited products were withdrawn from sales.
The Hunt for the Forbidden
On Friday, Moscow is expected to experience rain and thunderstorms.
The atmospheric front will pass through the capital region, bringing rainfall and lowering air temperature.
During the day, the air warms to 25 degrees.
On Saturday night, it will rain for a short time, and winds may rise to 15 m/s.
During the day, rain is expected with thunderstorms and wind gusts of up to 12-17 m/s.
Rains with thunderstorms are also forecast in the Orlovsk, Kursk and Voronezh regions, reports "Dni.ru".
It's unlikely to rain next week.
The WTO panel of arbitrators determined that Russian import duties on paper, refrigerators and palm oil were contrary to the rules of the organization.
The import rates exceed the commitments Russia took on when it joined the WTO.
"This is the first time the WTO has taken a decision against the Russian Federation", the organization's official website said.
However, the arbitrators stressed in their conclusion that the European Union had not provided sufficient evidence that Russia's measures were "systematic" or "comprehensive in nature".
Russia, in turn, has promised to adapt import duties on paper and refrigerators in the near future.
This is stated in the report of the Ministry of Economic Development of Russia.
On July 4, it was reported that Kiev intends to complain to the World Trade Organization about Russia's actions, which imposed additional restrictions on the transit of Ukrainian goods.
This is stated in the statement of the Ukrainian government.
In May, the Financial Times wrote that the U.S. conduct in resolving disputes in the WTO undermines the organization's accepted principles of discussion.
Similar statements were made by Brazil, Japan, the European Union and other WTO members because of the Americans' refusal to approve South Korean judge Chan Son-hwa for a second term.
In this regard, Russia will not seek WTO assistance on the issue of Western sanctions imposed against Russia.
The WTO is an international organization established in January 1995 to liberalize international trade.
It now has 162 member countries.
Russia joined in 2012.
The president's administration has changed its head
Russian President Vladimir Putin appointed Anton Vaino, former Deputy of Sergey Ivanov, as head of his own administration.
Vladimir Putin has made changes to the president's administration and expressed hope that the new head of his administration will contribute to the constructive work of the government and the Kremlin.
Anton Waino, in turn, said during the meeting that he considered the anti-corruption work he began to do as head of the administration of President Ivanov important and promised to cooperate with the government.
Earlier, Izvestia wrote that experts consider the situation with the resignation of Sergey Ivanov from the post of head of the administration transparent and understandable and the change will not change anything in the activities of the Kremlin administration.
They note that the head who left the office, who worked in the presidential administration for a long time, effectively built up the activities of the AP.
Instead, Deputy Chief of Staff Anton Waino came in, a man who knows the specifics of this job.
In Poland, they admit that they will not buy fuel from Gazprom.
The Polish state oil and gas company PGNIG does not exclude that in a few years gas supplies from Russia may become unattractive to it due to its reorientation to fuel from Norway and other countries.
This was reported by the vice president of the Polish company for finance Bogusław Mazec.
His words are being reported by TASS.
"It may happen that we will not buy gas at all (from Gazprom), we are now diversifying our supplies.
Within the next four years, the main supplies for us will be East, LNG-terminal raw materials and Norway", said Majets.
Gazprom is currently the dominant supplier of gas to Poland.
On Friday, August 12, PGNIG reported that the Russian supplier supplied it with nearly 5.3 billion cubic meters of gas in the first half of 2016, up 30% from 2015.
The share of the Russian gas giant in purchases from PGNIG has grown to 49.8% compared to 40% a year earlier.
On July 22, the Polish antitrust agency did not agree to establish a joint venture between Gazprom and its European partners to build the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline.
A month earlier, Poland had asked Gazprom to supply 11 billion cubic meters of gas via Nord Stream 2.
This was stated by the deputy chairman of the board of the holding Alexander Medvedev.
The auction for the North Stream 2 plant will be held in 2017, and the auction is scheduled to be held in the fall of 2016.
In late May, it was reported that Gazprom is not planning to take any action in connection with the Polish side's intention to abandon long-term contracts for gas supply from Russia after 2022, said the company's vice chairman Alexander Medvedev.
He recalled that in the first quarter of this year, Poles increased their gas purchases from the Russian Federation by only 42%.
The deputy representative of Gazprom added that the fact that the Polish PGNIG filed a complaint with the Stockholm arbitration court does not mean that the negotiations have been stopped.
Earlier, the Polish company had filed a lawsuit seeking a reduction in the purchase price of Russian gas.
Recall that the Polish government's commissioner for gas and energy infrastructure, Petro Naimski, said that the Polish authorities have decided not to extend the contract with Gazprom for gas supply.
Poland's contract with Gazprom was signed in 1996 and expires in 2022.
In March, the Polish government's commissioner for gas and energy infrastructure, Peter Naimsky, said that his country could abandon the supply of blue fuel from the east in six years.
According to him, Warsaw plans to build a new terminal for the supply of liquefied natural gas Baltic Pipe, which will connect the country to the Norwegian shelf.
"North stream-2" envisages the construction of two seawater gas pipelines with a combined capacity of 55 billion cubic meters of gas per year from Russia to Germany along the bottom of the Baltic Sea.
The OSCE Special Monitoring Mission (SMM) has increased the number of observers near the border of Ukraine with Crimea.
This was reported by the first deputy head of the SMM in Ukraine Alexander Hug.
"I can confirm that the SMM has increased the number of observers in this area", he said, answering the corresponding question of journalists, reports RIA Novosti.
According to the OSCE, the situation on the border between Ukraine and Crimea is calm, there are no incidents affecting security.
Observers were tracking the events at three checkpoints across the Russian-Ukrainian border.
The network has posted a video of a Yak-42 passenger plane landing at the airport of Ufa, which rolled out of the runway by 400 meters and crashed into the left wing.
The video was posted by the 360 channel.
The accident happened at 4.30 Moscow time.
The "CrossAvia" flight came from Sochi.
They were quickly evacuated to a safe place, no injuries.
The plane itself was transported to the parking lot.
The airport of Ufa is operating in normal mode.
The Volga Investigative Directorate on the transport of the SCR has been working to find out the cause of the hard landing of the plane.
The UN is investigating the use of chemical weapons in Syria.
The UN Special Commission is investigating the possible use of toxic gas in rebel-held areas of the Syrian city of Aleppo.
All sides of the conflict deny the use of chlorine, but the UN special envoy for Syria, Stefan de Mistura, considers the incident undeniable.
Such statements were made on the eve of the third round of inter-Syrian talks, which are due to begin in late August in Geneva.
UN specialists have launched an investigation into reports of chemical weapons use in the Syrian city of Aleppo.
The first reports of a toxic gas attack, allegedly chlorine, came out on August 2.
The opposition said that in the area where a Russian military transport helicopter was shot down the day before, the air force dropped bombs with the poisonous substance, but Moscow called the accusations a fluke.
Later, the Russian Defense Ministry blamed the opposition group "Harakyat Nur ad-Din az-Zinki" for the incident.
It soon became known that two toxic gas bombs had been planted.
This was confirmed by the BBC by one of the victims.
"A few minutes later, I felt the smell of gas, my eyes burned, and it was hard to breathe", the publication quotes the witness as saying.
At least seven people were killed and 23 were hospitalized.
If the use of the poison gas is confirmed by the experts, the action will be classified as a war crime.
The UN Special Envoy for Syria Staffan de Mistura told reporters: "There is a lot of evidence that this really happened".
The prohibition of chlorine in military use is set out in the Convention on the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (CWC).
Although all sides of the Syrian conflict deny the use of toxic gases, in 2015, human rights defenders recorded 35 cases of chlorine use by the Syrian army against "moderate opposition".
The situation in Aleppo is complicated by the fact that shelling of its districts is carried out daily and the terrorists prevent the evacuation of residents from the city.
According to Reuters, the UN expects Russia to establish a "humanitarian pause" in the war.
The organization's current three-hour daily silence regime is considered "not enough to help nearly 2 million trapped civilians".
Staffan de Mistura's humanitarian adviser, Jan Egellan, said a 48-hour ceasefire would be needed to deliver aid and evacuate sick and wounded every week.
"We have to send bulk cargoes from the truck column to the area where the roads have been almost destroyed and the ones that remain are mined", Mr. Egellan said.
Consultations in Geneva between the U.S. and Russian officials on the establishment of a "humanitarian pause" are ongoing.
How Russia opened "humanitarian windows" in Aleppo.
In the face of ongoing fighting over Aleppo, Syria's second largest city, Russia announced on August 11 that it would introduce a three-hour ceasefire regime that will be in effect daily starting Thursday.
The creation of "humanitarian windows" is designed to provide conditions for the delivery of medicines, food and basic necessities to the city.
The Russian Defense Ministry's decision was taken amid growing international pressure on Moscow, demanding that the military operation be called off and the negotiations resume.
Four people died in a series of explosions at a resort in Thailand.
There were several explosions in southern Thailand on Friday morning.
The attack killed four people and wounded 19.
The epicenter of the blasts has been the city of Hua Hin.
Among the victims were ten foreigners, citizens of four countries, no Russians among them.
No terrorist group has claimed responsibility for the incident, but the country's Interior Ministry hastened to say that Islamists are not involved.
Several people have been arrested on suspicion of carrying out the blasts.
According to preliminary reports from local police, the scale and specificity of the blasts suggest that they were directed against the country's military.
The attacks took place at popular tourist resorts, including Patong Beach in the Phuket area and the cities of Hua Hin, Trang and Surat Thani.
After the military junta came to power in 2014, economic growth fell from 7.2% (2012), to 2.8% (2015), but tourism remained one of the few industries to show development.
In 2016, 14 million people visited the country, which is 1.5 million more than in 2015.
The first suspects in preparing and organizing the attacks have already been arrested, police colonel Crisan Patanacharonen said.
It's too early to say what the goals are, he added, but the Interior Ministry "is confident they are not linked to international extremist groups".
It is too early to draw any conclusions, Mr Patanacharonen said.
But we know for a fact that these incidents are not directly linked to any form of terrorism, they are actually local diversions, and we're trying to identify those behind them.
The blasts occurred on the birthday of Thailand's Queen Secret.
The Thai junta considers protecting the monarchy one of its top priorities, so the incident is likely directed against it.
According to the statement of the police general Sitchikatchya Shrisopacharoenrat, the bombs were detonated remotely with a difference of half an hour.
They were hidden inside trees on busy streets filled with dining tourists in restaurants.
It's already been reported that one of the four dead was a Thai girl who was selling street food.
The identities of the other victims are unknown, but they are known to be residents of four foreign states.
According to the Thai Royal Police, four of them are German citizens, three are Dutch citizens, two are Italian citizens and one is Austrian.
There are no Russians among the victims of the blasts, the press service of Rosturizm reported.
Local experts also link the blasts to the August 7 referendum, in which 61.4% of the country's population supported the draft new constitution.
It was prepared by a commission to draft a constitution appointed by the military junta.
Voters had to decide whether they supported a system where the upper house of parliament was fully military and played a significant role in electing the country's prime minister.
The new system was adopted and will be tested for the first time in the 2017 parliamentary elections.
Recall that on May 22, 2014, a military coup took place in Thailand, led by the country's army commander, Prayut Chan-ocha.
He said the military was driven by a continuing political crisis and a lack of progress in the negotiations between the government and the opposition.
The military created the National Council for Peace and Order, imposed a curfew and censorship, dispersed the protesters and the upper house of parliament.
How Bangkok got into a state of emergency
The Thai government, led by Prime Minister Yinglack Shinawatra, in January 2014 declared a state of emergency in Bangkok and the capital's adjoining provinces.
The special regime lasted 60 days.
Like two explosions in Bangkok.
In January 2014, two explosions occurred in central Bangkok near the Victory Monument, where one of the main protests was taking place, injuring 28 people, five of whom were in critical condition.
The explosions were unknown on motorcycles.
The authorities have stepped up security in the capital and mobilized military forces to protect protesters.
The dry log has begun to develop conditions.
As it became known, the government was asked to agree on the terms of the auction on the Dry Log gold mine with two key restrictions.
The auction is not open to companies where 25% or more are owned by foreigners and to those who do not have at least 25% of the state's shares.
Industry participants do not expect the government to rewrite the terms, noting that many players are not at risk of taking on a complex and expensive project.
They can announce the auction in August and hold it in October.
The Ministry of Nature has submitted to the government a draft of the terms and conditions of the auction for the largest undeveloped gold mine in Russia, the Dry Log (Irkutsk region, reserves and resources - 130 million ounces), two sources familiar with the situation told "Ъ".
The bill was introduced Wednesday night, one of them said.
The Ministry of Nature confirmed to the Commerce that the project was submitted to the government.
The deputy prime minister's representative for the underground use, Alexander Kloponin, told the "Community" that the project had not yet been submitted to the official's office.
"The auction may be announced in August, immediately after the government's order is issued, and with the deadline for collecting applications from potential participants (at least 45 days), the tender may be held in October", the Ministry of Nature said.
According to the "Commission", the project retains two key requirements for potential participants, written in the version that was sent to the ministries and FOIs for approval in July (it is with the "Commission").
The first is the presence of at least 25% of the state's shares in the capital of the applicants.
The second is the denial of access to auctions for companies controlled by foreign investors, based on the FZ-57 understanding of investments in strategic societies.
According to the two articles of the Federal Law, as already written by the "Ъ" on August 2, companies whose beneficiaries (25% of shares and above) are not tax residents of the Russian Federation or have dual citizenship may not be admitted to the auction.
The government has the right to impose such restrictions, as the Dry Log refers to the federal-important underground (reserves of more than 50 tons of gold).
The Ministry of Nature confirmed that the project "contains restrictions on the admission of foreign companies", but declined to comment on details until the government order.
The demand for state participation in the capital of the auction participants was put forward by the Irkutsk region, which in December 2015 spoke "Ъ" to the Ministry of Nature and was later confirmed by the governor of the region Sergei Levchenko, noting that it was sent to the Ministry of Nature by his predecessor Sergei Yeroschenko, "who had agreements on investment projects with "Rosteh"".
Who lobbied for the restrictions on foreigners, the interviewers of the "Community" do not specify.
"But it's in the spirit of the times: not to give control of Russia's largest gold mine against the backdrop of Western sanctions", says a "Ъ" interviewer familiar with the auction.
On August 1, the head of the Ministry of Nature, Sergey Donskaya, said that foreigners "can go to the consortium" if the candidates attract them "as a financial structure, technological partners".
The interlocutors of the Commerce Department believe it unlikely that the government will adjust the conditions.
The main contender for the Dry Log in the industry is the consortium of Russia's largest gold miner PJSC "Polus", controlled by Suleiman Kerimov's son Said, and "Rostec".
As "Ъ" wrote, in July the partners created the joint venture "SL ZOLTO", where "Polus" owns 51% of the shares, the RRT-GDR "Rostech" structure - 49%.
Rostek declined to comment, while Poles said they were "obviously interested in this asset" and had all the necessary competencies and resources to develop it.
"But the final decision on the possibility and format of our participation will be made after the conditions are announced", - added in "Polar".
ALROSA may participate in the auction, but the decision is for the Russian government, sources said.
The Russian GV Gold and Canadian Kinross, which develops assets at Chukotka, have announced that they can participate in the development of the dry log, while Polymetal and Nordgold, according to "Ъ", are not interested in the asset.
The head of the Russian Federation's Union of Gold Industrialists Sergei Kashuba in December 2015 valued the investment in the Dry Log by "Community" at $2,5-4 billion.
Most potential applicants are not only afraid of the volume of investment, but also of the complexity of the project: serious exploration of reserves and technology for working with complex mines is needed, "community" interlocutors in the industry explain.
The largest M&A transaction on the pension market - "KIT Finance" - started with the process of merging four controlled NPFs.
As a result, the NPF will be created on the basis of the "Gazfund Pension Accumulations" with a volume of accumulations of about 373 billion rubles.
The owner of 100% of the funds of the "KIT Finance Pension Administrator" LLC announced yesterday that the procedure for the merger of four pension funds - "KIT Finance", "Promagrofond", "Heritage" and "Gazfund Pension Accumulations" - has been launched.
"The reorganization is carried out in agreement with the Central Bank, while respecting the requirement not to deteriorate the conditions of the existing contracts", the company said in a statement.
The merger is carried out on the basis of the Gazfund Pensions Akkumulation.
As noted by the director general of this NPF, Oleg Byalashitski, the association of the funds allows to solve several tasks: expanding the geography of presence, concentrating resources for development, reducing costs, printing the best practices of each of the funds and optimizing corporate governance.
According to him, the target date for completion of the consolidation is the second quarter of 2017.
As a result of the merger, Gazfund Pensions Akkumulation will become the largest player in the PSU market.
According to data for March 31, the pension savings of the merging funds exceeded 373 billion rubles.
According to the accounts on the foundations' website, the beneficiaries of their owner - "KIT Finance Pension Administrator" - are currently Anatoly Gavrelenko (who owns 65% of the funds through controlled LLCs) and Gazfund (35%).
However, the group's merger itself was launched much later than the competitors.
So, the control group O1 of the NPF "The Future" absorbed "Stalfund" at the beginning of this year.
Currently, this combined NPF joins the Uralsib and Russian Standard funds.
"Uniting into a single structure, besides reducing costs, is necessary for solving structural problems", says Nikolai Sidorov, general director of the NPF "Future".
Active work on the consolidation of funds has been underway since April and the pension group "Safmar" - the NPF "European", "Education and Science" and "Regionfund" should be merged into the NPF "Safmar" by the end of this year.
In 2017, the NPF "Trust" will join them.
"The merger of the funds will have the effect of strengthening control over risks, operational processes and expenses", - said the pension group "Safmar".
The pause in the fund merger, which the ITF Finance Pension Administrator endured, could be caused by several reasons, experts say.
Until recently, NPFs could not buy back more than 40% of the volume of infrastructure bond issues in which the group was actively placed.
After amendments to the Central Bank's resolution in March of this year, a number of issuers complying with the regulator's requirements no longer have such restrictions.
If necessary, the entire issue can be bought by one major player", says Yuri Nogin, director of the rating group of the financial institutions of the AKRA.
Several NPF executives from the top 15 in assets cite a possible break as another reason for the splitting of spheres of influence and, as a result, the single fund's personnel appointments, which the group's owners had to agree on.
Anatoliy Gavrilenko was not available for comment yesterday.
The Gazfund NPF also did not respond to the "Ъ" request.
Although consolidating funds is a labor-intensive and inexpensive activity, in the long run it will be justified.
As the general director of the consulting company "Pension partner" Sergei Okolensnov points out, the "Gazfund Pension accumulations" has fewer outflows, the merger will stabilize the base of the other funds of the group.
At the same time, the more successful experience of the KIT Finance and Promagrofond NPF in the construction of retail sales of PPPs, as well as the use of more modern software, will be in demand.
The demands of the Central Bank on the processes and personnel of the NPF are constantly growing, so it is not appropriate to duplicate infrastructure on four funds under a single investment policy, says Pavel Mitrofanov, managing director for corporate ratings of "Expert RA".
"The effect of reducing duplicate functions will definitely cut off the possible costs of the merger", Mr. Mitrofanov said.
The cost of the merger of four funds is estimated by Sergei Okolysnov at 30-50 million rubles.
"The costs of maintaining four such funds amount to about 400 million rubles per year, and if consolidated in the medium term, the budget will be cut in half", Mr. Okolсноv said.
The best Disney movie "Pit and his dragon" went on the Russian rental.
The beautiful landscapes of New Zealand, the delightful dragon, the breathtaking story and the country songs are enough to make you believe in old-fashioned magic again, says Elena Krauts.
The frightened baby was picked up by a dragon, who became a human baby and a gentle nanny and a loyal friend.
Pete calls his buddy Elliot after a puppy from a fairy tale, plays chase with him and falls asleep in a hug.
Six years later, he was grown up and in a belt, and he was no longer distinguished from another wild-looking forest plumber, the Maugly.
In this form, Pete discovers a red-haired female hedgehog, Grace (Brice Dallas Howard), while a brigade of Gavin (Carle Urban), her husband's brother, aggressively clears the forest.
Now she's not only gonna have to believe in the dragon, but help save him.
Pete is taking a fast-paced course of "being human" surrounded by idyllic Americans who wear cowboy shirts, a moral code in their hearts, and smile more dazzlingly than any advertisement.
No character looks or acts too badly for the viewer to really hate or fear.
Even Gavin, who has been hunting for the unusual inhabitant of the forests under his control, is far from an irreparable villain.
A huge furry dragon also turned out to be quite a fearsome creature, with a good bull face, a plane-liner wing span and the ability to become invisible.
The dragon is funny in its howling, whining, even snoring, and fortunately, it doesn't speak, but it always wants to be caressed, which is what makes it different from all the other famous cinematic dragons.
Elliot's visual image and holding holds such a high degree of emotional engagement that in the most stressful moments, not only young audiences but adults also begin to cry desperately in three streams.
Amazingly good and young Oak Fighley as Pete, torn between a potential family and a real friend.
And Robert Redford virtually gives a canonical grandfather who would be happy to have literally every child.
How did director David Lowery manage to make a fantastically cute remake of the forgotten 1977 Disney movie "Dragon Pete", a mid-sized nose to tail, and remembered only by a mix of animation and gameplay, and make it the most soulful film of the summer?
It's a miracle that helped.
In his painting, Laurie took only two things from the original: an orphaned Pete and a dragon.
The music numbers and most of the weird jokes were left behind.
This good story is a collection of traits borrowed from Bambi, Alien and many other sweet-hearted children's paintings.
Disney Studios continues to successfully expand its gallery of high-quality remakes of the 21st century.
Of course, "The Pit and the Dragon" isn't as stunningly beautiful as the Jungle Book itself, and it doesn't have the skillful villain Kate Blanchett was as a stepmother in the new "Ghost".
But this naive film is no less successful in helping us believe in miracles and goodness in the best Disney traditions.
By the way, the keys to Disney's magical castle are back for director Lowry to make a film adaptation of the story of Peter Pan.
Working on the "Pete and His Dragon" tandem, David Lowry and screenwriter Toby Halbrooks are joining an ambitious new project about an underage boy from James Barry's fairy tale of the same name.
RBC journalist Alexander Sokolov will be charged with a new crime
The lawyers of the RBC journalist Alexander Sokolov, accused of organizing the activities of the extremist structure, said that the prosecutor's office found flaws in their defendant's case.
The prosecutor's office made such a statement, we learned from the investigators literally yesterday.
We were scheduled to attend a court hearing on the issue of limiting our access to criminal case materials, but the meeting did not happen, and investigators informed us about the submission made by the prosecutor's office", RBC quotes lawyer Olga Dinze.
She said the prosecutor's office had indicated to investigators that the case and the materials collected were not qualified.
Now the investigators will have to close the gaps in the evidence base and press a new charge against Alexander Sokolov.
Either another article of the Criminal Code (Code) appears in the case, or it remains the same, but with other arguments and new evidence, Ms. Dinza clarifies.
According to the "Ъ", Alexander Sokolov was arrested on July 29, 2015.
In June of this year, it was reported that the investigation excluded from the accusation of the RBC journalist the wording about "disrupting the political situation towards instability" and "overthrowing the government illegally".
"Kommersantbosport" correspondent Alexander ZILBERT lived the life of an Olympian in the Olympic Village, inspected the home of the Russian national team, dined in the local dining room and even passed the WADA test after that.
I don't think life stops here for a second.
Even at night.
The final starts sometimes end at midnight, after which athletes need another hour and a half to two to return to the Olympic Village.
And there's a constant movement of people to settle and to leave the village, because some athletes finish their shows and leave Brazil, and some just come here.
And at 7:30 a.m., the heads of all Olympic delegations are in one of the temporary tents.
At these meetings we usually discuss some operational issues, - says the head of the sports delegation of the Russian Olympic team Igor Kazikov. - Although the house in which our house was located, count it, is exemplary - it was put into operation one of the first and demonstrated to all the checkers, even in it there are some flaws.
The hot water problem, the toilet problem.
We've been fighting for cleanliness for a long time.
At first, no one came to clean.
Then the cleaners came, but they just stuffed something on the floor, that's all.
They have some groundbreaking floors, you see.
I mean, you can't wash them humanly.
We know these floors are ordinary laminate!
Well, we've got a change of clothing company and now it's all right.
The Olympic Village is a South Butovo, a sleeping area, surrounded on one side by mountains, on the other side by an impressive pit, with places filled with water.
And for reliability, there's a 20-foot-wide iron fence that goes all the way around.
The village can accommodate up to 17,000 people in 3604 apartments in 31 houses.
One of the 18 story buildings has a huge Russian flag - this house is completely dedicated to the needs of our team.
Looking at the small lobby at the entrance, you can immediately identify what problems are apparently the most pressing for the national team.
Two advertisements are hung on the registration desk: "Please don't throw paper in the toilet!" and "I'll accept the badge as a gift.
The stand itself is drowning in the booklets.
Their cheerful blossoming contrasts with the headlines of the brochures: "Memory of Infectious Diseases for Travelers to Rio de Janeiro", "First Aid in the Event of Drownedness, Strange Body Inhaling, Loss of Consciousness - Stages of Cardiovascular Resuscitation", "First Aid in the Event of Burns, Heat Stroke, Fractures, and Bleeding".
The text inside is pretty encouraging.
For example, "Infection is accompanied by fever and subsequent treatment.
However, not everyone will have a favorable outcome.
Of course, the Russian national team has a medical center, which is ready to provide qualified assistance to residents at any time, including relaxation and sports massage.
The medical center is right across the street from our delegation headquarters.
Next to the door is an inspiring poster "No matter what, we will win!"
And, of course, the poems:
All the arguments are absolute nonsense!
Only those who fear believe in them.
The less we are, the more sweet the taste of victory, Russia will not back down, not break!
And to further uplift the spirit, the announcement is: "Dear brothers and sisters!
With the blessing of the Holy Patriarch of Moscow and all Russia Kirill, the spiritual care of the athletes of the Russian Olympic team is carried out by the protoherry Andrei Vladimirovich Alekseev.
You can order a molebene and other beans over the phone...
In fact, there is a Meditation and Religious Rite Center for all faiths in the village.
Well, the Russians, it turns out, are privileged - they have their own chapel.
Due to the load of elevators from the ninth to the fourth floor, I decided to go down the stairs that are recommended for fire use.
And in the darkness, he stumbled upon the bodies lying on it.
Looks like they were sleeping employees of the new clothing company.
I believe, ready to go for an innovative floor wash at any moment, they decided to set up a quiet hour directly on the cold steps.
On the fourth floor, I was waiting to meet a longtime acquaintance, Vitaly Fedorovich Dubko, the coach of our batutists who led them to Olympic gold 16 years ago in Sydney.
He and his student, European champion Jana Pavlova, kindly agreed to show us their rooms.
"We live in pairs, the beds are almost in the same place, but that's not critical.
Sanusel is one on four, but it's spacious.
The closet is, of course, funny, fabric, trust-inducing, but things can be put down.
"No, you pretend they're out of tea!" says Svetlana Kuznetsova, a tennis player I met in the main dining room.
It is called the main one because it covers an area of 2,7 thousand square meters and is ready to accommodate 5 thousand visitors at the same time.
They're giving out 60,000 servings a day for free.
The menu options are: "Best of Brazil", "World Kitchens", "Asian dishes" and "Pizza, pasta".
The last option, as I've seen, is very popular with our volleyball players.
And I've never found soups in any of the department stores of a giant restaurant.
What soup? - Kuznetsova wonders. - No tea!
Good thing I brought a Chinese, a baked one.
And the teapot.
But, for your information, we're even worse off at the food court.
There's at least one thing to choose from, despite the unbearable uniformity.
I personally picked a couple of steaks and a tomato sauce.
Near each dish is a plaque with its name in three languages - English, French and Portuguese - and a food value and allergenicity.
Well, I'll admit, it was edible.
I don't even know why there's a line like this at a local McDonald's.
Satisfied, relaxed, warm athletes are waiting at the restaurant's exit by our best friends, representatives of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA).
They're being tricked by a winner's victory, which is a T-shirt.
They're provoking, you might say!
To receive a gift, you must answer at least eight of the ten questions correctly.
I have questions in Russian! "A girl from WADA attacked me.
But that's not what I attacked.
I mean, I was caught up in a patriotic drive, naturally.
The situation has been exacerbated by the second question: "If I receive a doping control notification, should I go to the doping control point immediately?"
I stopped at option B. "No, I have one hour".
Lost, so to speak, his vigilance.
I forgot you didn't have to wait for WADA to relax.
Well, we need to show up right away.
Well, in the seventh stage of the victory, my situation became very critical.
I thought, for some reason, if I'm having trouble eating a balanced diet because of my busy schedule (and I'm having trouble, by the way!), then I can use bio-supplements to get "productive supplements".
No, they won't!
The answer is not strictly prohibited, but it is strongly rejected in a few sentences.
WADA is playing this game unfairly!
How are you, Russia? - the head of the quizzes asked.
We have nowhere to turn - behind Efimov, Isinbayev and our whole team.
So I focused on it and I won the unlucky shirt.
You know what they say, ours!
I was in a winning mood and went to the gym next door.
Get a hold of the trainer count.
I'm down by 250.
He noted with surprise that no Russian athlete was found in this collection of runways.
But maybe it's the right thing to do?
Let him train who can't play!
And there was this guy sitting in a nearby clinic.
I'm in line for the eye doctor.
Don't worry, not the shooter.
But the clinic, like the whole village, has a condom machine hanging everywhere.
It has an encouraging message: "Celebrate with a condom!"
All that remains is to spin the iron resembling a door lock handle, and the condom made of natural Amazon latex is ready to fall out of the machine.
I got one for a memory.
They 've taken 450,000 of them .
The Olympic Village has a whole entertainment center for festive and leisure.
A sign next to it, just in case, reminds me that the International Olympic Committee spends $3.25 million a day on athletes in different ways.
The center is flooded with video games, pool and tennis tables, table football and hockey, and some strange video-trainers-like devices.
What is this? - I'm interested in a comrade in the uniform of the Ukrainian national team who actively uses a wild game.
I could, of course, just say that I don't want to talk to a man in a Russian team uniform, that's all.
There's a strange coincidence here that the boys in the yellow and blue are being cut off.
The best team, it turns out.
It takes at least three hours to get around the village, looking in every corner.
But if you walk instead of driving electric cars, you'll have a Canadian clubhouse with lobster at the entrance and a restore bathroom tent, a ticket office, a laundry room, a chemist, a barber shop, a flower shop, a grocery store, a unique stamped post office (you can't wait for a Chinese philatelist to come), a bank, a finds office, and a photo kiosk.
And late at night, you'll be hanging by an olive tree with colorful ribbons in memory of the athletes' friends and relatives who have left this world.
And you'll be accompanied by a machine that clutterily sprays insect-killing liquids, thinking of eternity.
I mean, about the Olympic Movement.
Which in this village never stops.
While the rest of the Russian world was watching, the Australians were about to punish the American Dream Team, real fans went online.
Few people know: the news that Inna Deriglazov won gold in rapping at the XXXI Olympics, I got first.
I may even be the only Mosquito who saw it happen, except for those who watched the Carioca game that night.
Only a real fan can understand that.
This is a Moscow night.
The neighbors downstairs, as usual, wake up at one o'clock in the night and start screaming at each other, but very loudly.
And it's dangerous to move furniture.
There's a tap in the kitchen, so there's no time to go to the market and buy a new one, as the plumber asked.
The TV schedule is not clear, so I just kept the control of the "Match", "First" and, just in case, "Russia" channels - although that's almost pointless.
Russia is the home of repetitions, all the sports there are on tape for some reason.
They're broadcasting live there.
The hope, of course, is for the "Match" - all night a young man was screaming in the news first about the great semi-final of Deriglazov-Shanaev, then about the upcoming gold fight.
It would make sense to show.
But instead of basketball, it's the U.S.A. - Australia.
I can't say anything bad about this decision, by the way.
The Australians were tied, the first half won.
Put in place of the Americans who were outnumbered by their own greatness.
As a result, we lost, but as they say, the Olympic basketball tournament will no longer be the same.
It's all good, but there's a fight coming up against DiFrancisca, and on screen, no changes.
I start to wander through the channels in a slight panic.
It's like the second time in a row they've been spinning.
All right, let's go deep, get to the cable.
There's no fencing in any of the thematic matches.
And I'm getting the feeling the fight is about to begin.
I'm not happy with the text and tweets on some sports sites.
Surfing in a cage gives an unexpected, yet brilliant result.
The First website is a live technical broadcast of all the competitions that are taking place at this time.
I click on the fencing, I get the gold fight.
Deriglazov is a great counterattack, moving forward on the points - and obviously starting to pull the time.
The Italian is playing almost the entire break.
Our one point lead, just over two seconds to go.
Di Francesca is throwing herself at Deriglass, she retreats, time runs out, the Italian woman gives her shot.
- The win!
A few seconds later, an Olympic messenger on his phone tells me of his fourth gold medal.
Turns out I'm the first person to see it.
Mad, loyal, involved.
The Religious Administration of the Muslims of Tatarstan (DMT) refuses to use the Russian language in mosques.
Yesterday, the DUM plenum ordered its imams to hold Friday sermons only in Tatar to force young Tatars to "learn their native language".
The administration says it "does not in any way infringe" on the rights of Muslims of other nationalities.
In some mosques in Kazan, it is reported that up to 60% of parishioners, including foreign students, migrants and Tatars themselves, do not understand the Tatar language.
Imams fear that their sermons in Tatar "will not reach the entire audience".
Yesterday, the plenum of the Duma of Tatarstan unanimously decided to hold Friday sermons in the mosques of the republic only in the Tatar language.
As Tatarstan's Mufti Kamil Samigullin stated, this should be an incentive for young Tatars to "learn their native language".
"For those who say it's hard, we intend to organize free Tatar language lessons in every big mosque", Mr. Samigullin promised.
He added that "the decision has already entered into force" and today in all mosques "the sermon should be in the Tatar language".
He reminded that the DUM of Tatarstan publishes the magazine "Sura" with typical sermons in the Tatar language.
An imam who does not speak Tatar well enough "can prepare well for them".
The DUM of Tatarstan unites more than a thousand parishes in all the municipalities of the republic.
According to the mufti, in the districts, Friday sermons are conducted exclusively in the Tatar language.
At the same time, in Kazan, a number of mosques used mainly Russian.
In particular, as the mufti pointed out, this was practiced in the Burnaev Mosque, the Zakahana and the "Eniler".
However, Mr. Muhammadshin stressed, the leadership sets the task that all students should be able to speak both official languages of the republic, regardless of nationality.
"There can be no talk of any abuse of the Muslims-Netatars", said Mr. Muhammadshin, explaining that preaching itself "is not an obligatory, main part of the prayer".
At the same time, the prayers will still be read in Arabic, and the mosques will still have lectures and lessons in Russian.
At the same time, Rafik Muhammadshin said that there was no serious threat of displacing the Tatar language from mosques.
He said that other languages besides Russian and Tatar, such as Uzbek or Tajik, are not used in the sermons in the republic.
The decision of the DUM was actively supported in the executive committee of the World Congress of Tatars (WCT).
The head of the WKT executive committee, Rinat Zakirov, told the "Community": "Mosques are an important part of our national life".
It would be sad if the Tatar language left this sphere.
He noted that preaching in Tatar language is "the will of the imams themselves", but the WKT executive committee "considers it correct".
The interviewed "Ъ" imams who preached in Russian were ready to implement the DUM's decision, but believed that parishioners would have difficulty understanding the clergy.
Tatars and Russians go to the mosque.
Many people don't understand the language.
They'll be very sad.
"We're going to have to rebuild", says Farhat Mavletdinov, an imam at the Burnaev mosque.
He said that preaching in Russian is even closer to many Tatars, because "Russian is everywhere in schools, in kindergartens, on the radio".
However, he believes that the mosque will be able to continue Russian language lessons and lectures, which are held on other days.
We rely on God.
God will show us the way out of this situation", he concluded.
But about 60% of us don't know the Tatar language.
They're both Uzbeks and Tajik and Azerbaijanis.
We have a lot of foreign students coming to us: Africans, Arabs.
"That's why we've been transitioning to Russian for four years", says the imam.
He believes that the sermons in the Tatar language will "reach to a narrower circle and not to the entire audience".
But we will obey the decision of the plenary.
It's just that the outcome of the sermons will be different.
But time will tell.
"For me, for example, it will be easier because the Tatar language is my mother tongue", said Gabdulla Galiullin.
Former FSIN director brought to justice
The Moscow prosecutor's office has approved the indictment on the criminal case investigated by the State Police of the Russian Federation on theft of budget funds allocated to the Russian SSI.
The former head of the prison department Alexander Reimer and his deputy, who caused the FSIN damage of more than 2,7 billion rubles, will be brought before the court.
The capital's prosecutor's office sent a criminal case to the Zamoškvoretskiy district court against former Russian FSIN director Alexander Reimer, his former deputy Nikolay Krivolapov, as well as director of the FGUP "Civil Service Information and Communications Center" (FGUP) Viktor Oterminov.
Depending on the role and degree of participation in the commission of crimes, they are accused of being involved in the Moscow SCR GSC under Article 3 of Article 285 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation (misuse of official powers, which has caused severe consequences), Article 4 of Article 159 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation (fraud committed using their official position, in the composition of an organized group, in a particularly large amount).
In addition, Krivolapov is charged under Article 222 (1) of the Russian Criminal Code (illegal acquisition and storage of ammunition).
According to the SCR, in 2010-2012, these individuals fraudulently stole from the state treasury the budget funds allocated to the FSSI to provide the agency with electronic monitoring systems of controlled persons, so-called electronic bracelets.
To steal the budget money, the group's participants developed a scheme, according to which the CITOS FDUP under their control, with which they had concluded appropriate state contracts, produced technical control and supervision tools, including "electronic bracelets", and sold them at prices several times higher.
Although the CITOS FDU did not have production equipment, buildings, facilities to house production capacities, allowing to create a complete cycle of production of "electronic bracelets", five state contracts were concluded between it and the Russian Federal Police Service for the amount of more than 3,3 billion rubles.
As a result of this scheme, more than 2 billion rubles were stolen from the accounts of the Samara branch of the FDUP.
According to the investigation, Mr. Reimer received more than 140 million rubles of cash in his office from one of the accomplices, against whom the criminal case is assigned to a separate proceedings.
Nikolai Krivolapov, who was involved in the machinations, was found to have unknown origin of the cartridge to the award pistol, which allowed him to be charged with additional charges.
In this case, which was 133 volumes, the FSIN filed a claim against the accused for compensation of material damage in the amount of 2,7 billion rubles.
Football player Hakan Shukur is suspected of involvement in the coup.
Turkish authorities issued a warrant for the arrest of former footballer and then parliament member Hakan Şukür and searched two homes in his family.
Turkish football star of the 1990s - early 2000s attacker Hakan Shukur is wanted by the country's authorities in connection with the attempted coup d'état that took place last month.
Forward, who finished his sports career in 2008, is accused of being a member of an "armed terrorist group".
The movement is a society associated with the prominent Turkish religious leader and opposition figure Fethullah Gülen.
It is his president, Erdogan, who is considered the organizer of the July 15 coup attempt.
Fethullah Gülen lives in the US, the Turkish authorities demand his extradition.
According to local media, today a warrant was issued for the arrest of Hakan Shukyu, police have already searched two houses belonging to the former footballer's family.
According to the investigation, Gulen's father was not only a member of the Fethullah Gulen organization but also of the Hakan Shukhur organization.
However, neither the former footballer nor his family members were there.
He and his family now live in the United States.
As a football player, Hakan Shukur defended the colours of several Turkish clubs and represented the national team.
He spent most of his career at Galatasaray.
The list of foreign clubs includes Italian "Torino", "Inter" and "Palermo", as well as English "Blackburn".
True, he hasn't spent more than a season in any of them.
Hakan Shukyar remains the most productive striker of the Turkish national team: he has played 112 matches for the national team and scored 51 goals.
In 2013, Hakan Shukyr left his parliamentary post due to the beginning of a corruption investigation around Erdogan's party and his immediate surroundings.
According to the Turkish newspaper Hurriyet, at least 42 journalists were arrested in Turkey on July 25.
They are accused of aiding a military coup and of ties to the opposition Islamic preacher Fethullah Gülen, who lives in the United States.
Given the seriousness of the charges, media workers could face long prison terms ranging from 10 years to several life sentences.
Yegor Konchalovsky wants to create a network of cinemas for domestic films only.
"I would create a network of cinemas exclusively for Russian cinema, which cost 2-3 times less than foreign films", he said.
Mr. Konchalovsky notes that Russian films are difficult to compete for viewers with big Hollywood films.
We have more than 100 pictures a year in the country, and we have an average of 20-25 tapes on screen.
"Even they have a hard time competing with Transformers and Iron Man, which have been heavily budgeted to promote", said the filmmaker.

In Miass (Czeliabinsk region) the lawyer of former vice-governor Nikolay Sandakov Konstantin Akulic was arrested.
As reported by the "Ъ-Southern Ural" another lawyer of the accused - Sergei Kolosovsky, Konstantin Akulic was called to the investigation department of the SCR Miass to present charges in a case of beating.
At that time, Konstantin Akalić was on his way to the scene of the accident as a lawyer to help one of his participants.
"Initially it was triggered against unidentified persons. Now, when he began to defend Nikolai Sandakov, it turned out that it was Akalich", - says Sergei Kolosovsky.
Konstantin Akulich became the lawyer of the former deputy governor in early August.
Half an hour before the lawyer in the SCR called Miass, the defense was informed that on Monday the deadline for examining the materials of the fraud case in which Nikolai Sandakov is accused expires.

Russian copper company (RMC) is ready to take on social responsibility and pay more attention to environmental aspects of its business.
This is confirmed, for example, by the fact that RMK has taken over the modernization of one of the oldest and most environmentally "dirty" enterprises in the country - the Karabakh copper smelting plant.
Karabas copper smelting plant was founded by an English joint stock company headed by Leslie Urkward in 1910.
In Soviet times, it was an important industrial enterprise for the country's economy, and it actually provided the livelihoods of an entire city.
However, in the 1990s due to financial problems, production was halted, which led to serious social problems in Karabakh.
In 1998, the decision was taken to resume the work of the Karabakh copper smelting plant.
One of the main problems of the Karabakh plant - environmental problems - had to be solved.
By the early 2000s, Karabakh was already known as an ecological disaster zone.
The situation at Karabasmedi began to change in 2004, after the enterprise came under the control of the Russian copper company.
The company began to modernize production, which gradually reduced the environmental burden.
This was recently noted by the governor of the Chelyabinsk region, Boris Dubrovsky, who visited Karabachmed in the first days of July.
The head of the Southern Ural called the changes that have occurred with the enterprise since "Karabashezhmed" has moved to the group of RMK.
The main event in modernising Karabasmedi in recent years has been the construction of a new sulfuric acid workshop, which allows to capture up to 99.9% of metallurgical gases.
According to the president of the Russian copper company, Vsevolod Levin, the investment in this project amounted to about 7 billion rubles.
The next stage of modernization of Karabašmejd JSC is the reconstruction of the convertor section.
Replacement of three converters, dust collectors, gas pipeline is planned for the end of 2017.
The cost of the project is 2.5 billion rubles .
In addition, at the end of 2016, a new industrial waste treatment plant with a cost of 1 billion rubles is planned to be launched.
In turn, the amount of taxes that are deducted into the budget of Karabakh city will increase.
For the entire period of the project of the Tomina State Government - from the start of construction and until the second round of commissioning - the federal treasury will receive 8,9 billion rubles.
And after the GOK is put into operation, the tax revenue to budgets of all levels can be 80.9 billion rubles.
During the year of production in the Varna district, 346,3 million rubles were transferred to budgets of different levels .
And that's for the first year.
"The longer the company is running successfully, the higher the amount of allowances", added Valery Ulanovsky.
The RMC clarified that in 2015, tax deductions from the Miheevsk GOK approached 1 billion rubles.
However, the participation of RMK enterprises in the life and development of their territories is not limited to tax deductions.
RMK's enterprises help repair and maintain schools, kindergartens, sports facilities, build cultural and entertainment facilities, and improve the landscape.
In 2016, one of the largest social projects of the Russian Copper Company in Karabakh was the capital repair, and in fact - almost complete rebuilding of kindergarten N9 for 95 pupils.
The building, built in 1960, was in a state of disrepair.
Also on the territory of the "RMC Arena" will be a landscape park with an artificial pond, underground and overground parking lots for 600 car seats, cafes and sports shops.
The "RMC Arena" will be able to host spectacular professional sports events of international level.
But the main task of this project is to make physical education and sports in comfortable conditions accessible to the residents of Chelyabinsk, primarily to children.

The Black Sea Fleet conducted a counter-submarine-diversion defense operation in the Black Sea.
This was reported by RIA Novosti by the representative of the Ministry of Defense's press service department for the Navy Igor Digalo.
The training was conducted as part of the first stage of the training on special types of naval forces.

The Lake City Court of the Moscow region has approved the arrest of Roman Chernikov, who confessed to the murder of his six-year-old adopted daughter.
This was reported on Thursday, August 11, according to the Moscow city news agency, by the press secretary of the court Nina Zilkina.

Then, in order to hide the child's body, he burned it and scattered the remains with his wife in a large square.
On the evening of August 9, when the investigator was questioned, the foster parents reported that a six-year-old boy drowned in a bathtub in April 2016.
For a long time, they managed to hide the girl's disappearance from everyone, but in August, when they learned that they were soon to be visited by the custody officers, they decided to tell everyone that the child was missing.
The parents said that on August 6, their adopted daughter voluntarily left the area of the house where they lived with their family and disappeared.

The pensioner turned the stray into a "budget beach tower".
Users laughed at the photos of an elderly man setting up a beach trampoline and turning it into a water slide.
The photo was posted on several entertainment portals, as well as in the "My Tagalog" group on the social network "VKontakte", which led many to believe that the photo was taken on the shore of the Azov Sea.
In comments, the "innovation" was dubbed "budget tower" and "mobile trampoline".
Many praised the man for his ingenuity and "smoothness", while some noted that a man is at serious risk of injury when he jumps from his tower because he has set it at insufficient depth.
However, one commentator on Pikabu said that the depth of the sea cannot be judged by the picture.
"First, we don't know how deep it is, the beach can be crowded with a steep drop by a meter right behind the stairs, and second, even if it's a meter deep, with proper skill you can jump a couple of meters", wrote a user under the nickname C0JIbAMDJZ.

The French city of Cannes has banned people from visiting the beaches in a burkini, a special women's swimsuit that completely covers the body from head to ankle.
This is reported on Friday, August 12, by ABC News.
According to Mayor David Lisnard, such clothing "does not conform to the rules of decency, the principles of secularism, and does not conform to the standards of hygiene and safety".
He also said that clothing that emphasizes religious affiliation can cause disorder in society.
For wearing a burkini , a fine of 38 euros (about $ 42) was imposed .
The ban was imposed on the backdrop of the attacks that took place on July 15 in Nice and July 26 in the church of the city of Saint-Étienne-du-Rouvre in the north of the country.
After the law was introduced, several Muslim women appealed to the court, saying that the restrictions violate the right to freedom of religion.
The Blagoveshchensk city court (Amur region) sentenced the former head of the city, Alexander Migul, to nine years in a colony of the general regime.
This is reported on the court's website on Friday, August 12.
Miguel was found guilty of committing crimes under articles 286 ("Excess of powers"), 285.1 ("Unintentional expenditure of budget funds") and 285 ("Misuse of official powers") of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation.
The investigation found that the official had given a plot of land in the village of Muhinka to his acquaintance in December 2008 in violation of the procedure established by the land law.
In 2006, he illegally issued a decision to acquire the city's ownership of a highway bridge across the Chigirri River, at an exorbitant price without a competition procedure and a municipal contract, Interfax reports.
In addition, during the period 2007-2010, Miguel changed the terms of payments under the purchase and sale contract of the land plot lease, which was provided for the construction of housing, in the interests of the commercial organization under his control, and also exempted the company from rental fees.
As a result, the budget of the region was short of more than 5 million rubles, and the city treasury was about 21 million rubles.
On August 4, it became known that the former mayor, who was in custody on suspicion of corruption and who was seeking a deputy mandate, did not provide the voting ballot for participation in the State Duma elections and was removed from the pre-election race.
Miguel was arrested in May 2015 in the territory of the Lipetsk region and placed in SIZO.
He was previously wanted internationally since 2011.
Alexander Migula was mayor of Blagoveshchensk from November 2004 to April 2010.

The Thailand resort blasts are "local sabotage" and have nothing to do with international terrorism.
This was reported by the Thai police, Reuters reports.
According to law enforcement, they have not yet been able to determine if any of the explosions are related.

Owners of messengers and postal services should identify users and delete the banned information - this is a brief summary of the draft law developed by the Media-Communications Union (MCC), which brings together the largest Russian communications operators (available at "Vedomosti").
The three union-member companies confirmed that such a project is under discussion.
In early autumn, it is to be presented to a working group led by the first deputy prime minister Igor Shuvalov, says the interlocutor of "Vedomosti" at the ISS.
It's about amendments to the communications and media laws.
They provide that any "Internet distribution provider that provides the possibility of exchanging electronic messages" is obliged to identify users based on the information contained in the databases of the telecommunications operators, having previously entered into contracts with them.
And "immediately block messages or publications that contain information that is distributed in violation of Russian law".
Otherwise, operators are entitled to restrict access to the service by decision of Roskomnadzor.

WSJ: The U.S. is considering sanctions against Russia over the hack of Democratic servers.
U.S. officials are considering new sanctions against Russia in response to the Democratic Party's hack, The Wall Street Journal reports, citing sources.
The administration of US President Barack Obama is reportedly required to formally accuse Russia or Russian-backed hackers of attacking servers to impose sanctions.
According to the sources, the FBI and other US intelligence agencies are pretty sure that Russia was involved in the cyberattack.
WSJ notes that the United States usually prefers not to name those who carry out the hacking attacks.
The exception is the 2014 Sony Entertainment Pictures data breach, for which the DPRK was officially charged.
But last year, Obama issued a decree that simplified the sanctions process for those who carry out or facilitate cyberattacks.
It was originally intended against China, but it can be used against other countries.
The sanctions decision process could be long, the paper says.
Even if officials conclude that the hackers were operating with Russian support, they should consider the possible consequences before deciding to disclose the information.
They must determine whether the incident is serious enough to exacerbate tensions between the two sides.
Earlier, it was reported that the Obama administration is allowing sanctions against a state whose hackers hacked the Democratic National Committee's servers.
WikiLeaks has published an email from the Democratic National Committee.
Media reports said hackers working with Russian authorities may have been involved in the hack.
The Kremlin called such reports absurd.
FAS fined Google almost half a billion rubles
The reason for this was the competition in the mobile app market.
The antitrust proceedings were initiated by Yandex.
The Russian company claimed that Google provides smartphone manufacturers with access to Android components on terms that prohibited pre-installation of applications from other developers, in particular from Yandex.
FAS found support for these claims and found that the company abused its dominant position in the market and forced mobile device manufacturers to install it alongside the Google Play store of other apps.
The Federal antitrust service has decided to punish Google, according to FAS deputy head Alexey Dotenko.
The fine must be paid within 60 days of the entry into force of the order.
The FAS concluded that the competition law should be complied with by all companies, including transnational corporations.
Google, in turn, intends to study the decision first and only then decide what to do next: execute it or challenge it.
The Federal Anti-Monopoly Service found the company a breach of the competition law back in September last year and ordered it to adjust contracts by December 18.
But Google didn't give it a go.
Since then, the company and the department have been pursuing legal proceedings.
FAS said that despite the fine, they are discussing with Google the possibility of a settlement.
This measure will not do anything.
This is the opinion of the leading analyst of Mobile research group Eldar Murtazin.
Murtazin also noted that the fine will not affect users or the competitiveness of the corporation.
The Voljanin rented the apartment, then stole it for 84 thousand rubles.

They found a 30-year-old unemployed villain.
The man was arrested, he testified, saying that he had sold the stolen property.
Now he's going to have to answer for theft in the strictest sense of the law - a criminal case has been opened against the detainee.

"If we are given information on the owners of real estate and land plots as of January 1, the citizens of Crimea will be the taxpayers of these taxes next year", said Roman Nazrochev.
The benefits will be granted to the preferred categories of citizens, primarily the pensioners.
Also, there is a system of deductions based on the taxpayer's preferential category, but, according to the head of the UFNS, it is too early to talk about this until 2017.

Snapchat's "Anime" effect is being criticized as a caricature of Asians
Snapchat claims that this filter is inspired by anime, but some reviewers say it's racially unstable.
With the help of the "Lens", Snapchat allows about 150 million users a day to change reality and play with individuality in ways that border on absurdity.
You can turn yourself into a pineapple, a dog, or a character to be portrayed by Roy Liechtenstein.
Lenses are rough, curving features tools that create over 30 million tweaked selfies a day.
Any mistake quickly becomes public knowledge.
Snapchat's lenses have been criticized in the past for being accused of promoting dark facial skin or promoting white faces as a beauty ideal.
So when some users were offered a lens this week that gave them hairy eyes, curved teeth and bumpy cheeks, some critics called it a racist caricature of Asian  "yellow-haired".
And they wondered if these recurring contradictions point to a more serious problem for the company, the diversity problem.
On Wednesday, the news spread, and there was outrage in The Verge and Motherboard, the day after Snapchat announced it had removed the feature.
The company commented that the lens was designed as a tribute to anime characters, not as a cartoon about Asians.
But to experts who know about racism, the lens reminds us of offensive stereotypes in action.
Others completely rejected the comparison to the anime.
In an email, Grace Sparapani, a Korean-American art student whose photos were heavily tweeted, said the lens was "offensive and at least awkward".
She added that "it's hard to argue with the side-by-side comparison of a very rough caricature of Asians and the filter effects.
It shows that the filter is not just yellowish, but highly humiliating yellowish.
Snapchat is not the only company that's crossing these cultural bridges.
American culture seems to be engaged in an endless struggle for diversity and inclusiveness, from corporate halls to Hollywood and the devices we all carry around.
And the huge audience of young people on Snapchat -- who are more racially diverse than their older generation -- may mean they're more likely to be expected to understand.
When one of Snapchat's lenses creates an image that is offensive to the user, then, said 25-year-old Katie Zhu in an interview on Thursday, "this kind of trend is much harder to keep out of the way than it used to be".
On Thursday, Xu, a product manager and engineer who works for Medium, decided to delete her Snapchat account and urged others to do the same.
In an article for Medium and a phone interview, she said that she believes racial differences are the cause of insufficient diversity in hiring Snapchat.
Xu criticized the mostly white management of the company, which consisted only of men, and ended her article with the hashtag: #DeleteSnapchat.
As Xu, an American of Chinese descent, wrote: "Either they didn't have enough shady people in the state to make such decisions, or they had shady people working for them, but they didn't have positions where they could speak up safely and openly".
Other reviewers share her point of view, expressing dissatisfaction that Snapchat did not answer most of her questions.
The company does not publish information about the representation of national minorities in its state, emphasizing its status as a private company.
Snapchat on Thursday declined to discuss the racial background of its staff, but according to a trustee, the company recently hired a recruiter to focus on underrepresented segments of the population and active efforts to engage internal resources.
Xu said she would keep her Snapchat account closed, adding, "I wonder if they really need more users like us to be able to say that it won't work".
Military leadership misrepresented intelligence about ISIS, congressional commission reports
U.S. Central Command officials have modified intelligence reports to give a more optimistic picture of the war against Islamic State in Iraq and Syria than they give the basis for the on-site events, the congressional committee said in a report released Thursday.
An interim report by the task force set up by the Republican chairs of the House Committee on Armed Services, the Intelligence Committee, and the Subcommittee on Military Appropriations found "widespread discontent" among Central Command intelligence analysts who claim that the leaders misled their assessments of American actions aimed at defeating the Islamic State.
Central Command, known as Centcom, is the main military headquarters in Tampa, Florida, which oversees American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
"The intelligence documents approved by the Central Command generally gave a more optimistic picture of U.S. counterterrorism than confirmed by actual on-site data, and were consistently more optimistic than analysis provided by other intelligence services", the report said.
"What was happening at the Centers is unacceptable: when the top leadership is presented with a false analysis, our military suffers", said House member Ken Calvert, a Republican from California.
The leadership issues at the Central Committee are reaching the top of the organization.
The 10-page report details the shortcomings that persisted in 2014 and 2015 in the description and analysis of U.S. operations to train Iraq's armed forces provided by Central Command.
While it does not contain conclusive evidence that members of the Obama administration's leadership ordered the reports to be falsified, it claims that analysts felt that the leadership of the Central Committee was forcing them to present a more optimistic view of the threat from the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL.
"During the first half of 2015, many press releases, statements and testimony from the Central Command in Congress were significantly more optimistic than the real events", the report said.
For example, a Central Committee official has publicly stated that a major military attack to retake Mosul could begin as early as April or May 2015.
Mosul, Iraq's second largest city, remains under Islamic State control.
"After months of investigation, this is known for sure", House Speaker Mike Pompeo, a Republican from Kansas, said in a statement.
From mid-2014 to mid-2015, the top leadership of the U.S. Central Command's intelligence service forged intelligence documents to minimize the threat from ISIS in Iraq.
The Republicans formed an operational group when they learned that analysts had expressed concern that intelligence on the Islamic State was being falsified.
As the investigation progresses, the report released Thursday will be followed by more detailed data.
The Central Intelligence Commission's additional, unfinished investigation is being conducted by the Defense Ministry's chief inspector.
Representatives of the Democratic Party on the U.S. House Intelligence Committee released their own data on Thursday, which is consistent with some of the findings of the Republican Task Force.
"Between 2014 and 2015, the CIA created an overly closed procedure for producing intelligence assessments regarding ISIS and the Iraqi security forces",  states House of Representatives member Adam B. Schiff, the Democratic Party's chief representative on the committee.
This procedure, Schiff said, "has delayed the release of intelligence documents", damaged the moral status of analysts, and "does not sufficiently reflect divergent views".
But Schiff and the Democrats claim they found no evidence that the White House was trying to force Central Committee analysts to bring their findings under "a given or political interpretation".
The preliminary findings of the Congressional investigation were released Tuesday by The Daily Beast.
Last August, The New York Times reported on the existence of a Pentagon chief inspector's investigation, opened after complaints from Central Committee analysts.
Lt. Commander Patrick Evans, a Pentagon spokesman, said in a statement that the Department of Defense would not comment on the congressional report while the inspector general's investigation continues.
But he said that "experts sometimes disagree on how complex data is interpreted, and the intelligence community and the Department of Defense welcome healthy dialogue on these vital national security issues".
The findings go beyond whether the U.S.-led bombing of Iraq and Syria (as more and more Defense Ministry officials now claim) has achieved its goal.
But last year's statements have cast doubt on whether President Obama can rely on Central Command providing true estimates of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis points.
Criticism of Islamic State intelligence echoes a debate that took place more than a decade ago when Central Intelligence Analyst Gregory Hooker wrote a research paper claiming that the administration of President George W. Bush, out of protest by many analysts, supported a small number of troops in Iraq and did not think about what would follow the 2003 invasion.
Hooker also played a key role in the protests sparked by Islamic State intelligence.
Last year, officials said, Hooker's team concluded that despite public statements to the contrary, airstrikes on oil refineries owned by the Islamic State did not significantly worsen the financial situation of the terrorist group because it built temporary oil refineries to sell oil on the black market.
But the discovery was not spread outside Central Command, the Times reported in September.
The then Central Committee commander, General Lloyd J. Austin III, came under fire last year after testimony in the Senate that many deputies deemed an overly optimistic assessment of the war.
General Austin resigned in April and was replaced by General Joseph L. Votel in the Central Command.
The United States wins four straight games in women's hockey on grass, thus approaching a decisive battle with Britain.
Having scored three goals in a match that ended in a 6-1 win over Japan, Katy Bame opened the scoring on Thursday with the first two goals for the US women's hockey team on the grass, when the Americans won the Indian team 3-0.
Five goals in two games should be a memorable achievement, but 27-year-old Bam says she's not sure she would ever do anything like that.
"I'm not going to mind", she said.
I'm not really the type of person who keeps track of his goals.
Here's what she knows: the Americans are 4-0 in the Olympics, and they're competing for first place in their group with Britain, who are undefeated after losing to Japan 2-0 on Thursday.
The British and US teams will meet on Saturday in the final game of the first round.
Both teams will qualify for the quarterfinals, and the outcome of the game will determine who will be first in their group of six teams and who will be second.
The winner will avoid a meeting with a strong team of Dutch opponents, the leaders of another group, with a little weather to follow when the quarter-finals begin.
But Saturday's game shows the Americans are making a big noise here with their unexpected series, four years after they finished last among the 12 teams at the London Games.
Bam was on that team.
She grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, first picked up a hockey stick when she was 3 (her older twin sisters played the sport in Drexel), and joined the national team at age 16, becoming her youngest player in history.
She missed the 2008 Olympics when she missed the final round of qualifying.
Then came 2012, when she and her teammates were having a hard time.
The next year, Englishman Coag Parnham was appointed coach, and things started to change.
"Cultural change, psychological change, physical change", said Bame.
In London, we didn't have the productivity we have now.
We've completely changed our minds.
On Thursday night, Bam opened the score in the first half with an uncomfortable short-range throw.
India came into the game without a single win in the tournament, but the team proved surprisingly tough and kept the score 1-0 until the end of the third period when Bam took the initiative in his own hands.
She made a long walk with the ball down the left side of the field, then went down the center of the spiral and swiftly sent the ball into the gate, giving the Americans a 2-0 lead.
Melissa Gonzalez added the final goal in the middle of the fourth period.
The "dry" win was the first in the tournament for U.S. goalkeeper Jackie Briggs, who missed one goal in each of her first three wins.
She's in a hurry.
So is Bam.
"We're in a good position right now", said Parnham, "but how good it is depends on the outcome of Saturday's game".
In the midst of the Olympic Games - дзен jumps on the batut
Wherever you are, whatever the time it is, it's the Olympics.
The events in Rio de Janeiro seem unchanged and inevitable, a furious combination of competition and ambition.
It's like the Olympic flame itself, and it's that burning torch that's passed from the archer to the swimmer, to the gymnast, to the triathlete.
You can't turn on the TV, read the newspaper, or listen to your neighbors chat in a coffee shop and not hear about Simone Bales, Katie Ledecky, or the enmity between Michael Phelps and Chad de Kloe.
And there's Logan Dooley.
Dooley, the first-time Olympic athlete, the handsome guy with the holes on his cheeks, could well be among the celebrities featured in prime time, promoted by sponsors and life-affirming commercials, if he were a swimmer, gymnast, or even a fighter.
But 28-year-old Dooley of Lake Forest, California, is fighting for the gold in the Olympic jumping competition.
The Olympic flame does not illuminate all events equally.
Farther from the center, in the shadows, are sports that are not universally recognized: gun shooting, bow shooting, badminton, taekwondo.
Brass will always be with us, long reign to him.
But if I may speak out in defense of my personal addiction, let me draw your attention to the modest charm of the jumps on the bat.
Although scuba diving has been an Olympic sport since 2000, when it debuted at the Sydney Games, over the past 16 years it has received so little recognition that many of the people I interviewed were unaware that they were actually an Olympic sport.
It could be regional ignorance.
Although the United States sent athletes to the competition, they never won medals in the long jump, and their athletes did not reach the final until 2012.
Chinese and Russians usually share the men's prizes, and Chinese and Canadians share the women's.
Dun Dun from China and Rosie McLennan from Canada will defend their London gold medals this year.
But the ballet has an outsider's charm, especially because for the uneducated ear, it's more associated with a circus college than with the Olympics.
I have to admit here that I'm not an expert, I'm just an avid landing enthusiast.
They really have a comedic potential  it's the cartoonish twist of endless jumps  but also the grace of gymnastics and water skiing, two sports that they basically combine.
The word "batut" comes from the Spanish word "el trampolín", meaning "trampoline for jumping into water".
The contenders jump on a giant batut, flying almost 30 feet into the air, and must perform a series of acrobatic tricks (turns, bends and salto) before finally landing on their feet.
They are rated for performance, complexity and "flight time", according to the official Olympic program.
Thirty-two athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women, will compete in Rio.
The most common Olympic course is  forward.
Medal contenders must go further, faster, higher and higher in the pursuit of gold, sometimes to the finish, and sometimes back and forth, back and forth across the field.
They're not just looking for the finish line or the starting line, but also, in front of the camera, another teasing edge: a world or Olympic record.
This persistent quest is noble, admirable, even fanatical, and it is enough to make even the viewer stumble.
But I think it's a little tiring when you watch the Games.
He's a good guy for a little jumping on the bat.
The batutist's heading up.
Moving forward is not the goal.
He or she jumps up, seems weightless, like an astronaut, flies up, then down, then effortlessly up again.
And they're not without competition or difficulty, of course, but there's no crazy drive to finish, no long jumps, just the weird, elegant disappearance of time and gravity.
It's the closest Olympic sport to Zen.
The women's qualifying competition, followed by the final, will be held on Friday afternoon, broadcast at one o'clock Eastern European time; the men's competition will be held on Saturday, also at one o'clock.
NBC will broadcast the finale as part of a daytime program beginning at 2 p.m. on both days.
In the midst of the Olympic madness, there's a quiet, beautiful moment that can easily be seen in a general dump.
And if the only way to raise awareness is to subject male athletes to the desirable views and objectification -- as the Wall Street Journal recently suggested by male gymnasts in the United States -- Dooley is just waiting for his new crowd of admirers.
"Generation protests" in Ethiopia, longtime ally of the United States
Violent protests in Ethiopia
Protesters demanding political change in Ethiopia faced fierce opposition from the government.
Witnesses say dozens of protesters were fatally wounded in clashes with police.
Is Ethiopia really on the brink of division?
Over the past decade, it has been one of the most stable countries in Africa, a strong ally of the West with a rapidly growing economy.
But in recent months, anti-government protests have rocked the country, spreading to more and more of its territories.
In the past week alone, thousands of people have taken to the streets demanding radical political change.
Human rights activists say the government's reaction was brutal.
Witnesses claimed that police officers shot dozens of unarmed protesters.
Video footage from the protest sites, allegedly taken late last year or early this year, shows security officers beating young people with sticks when they were put their hands against a wall.
A senior United Nations human rights official is now calling for a thorough investigation.
"It has always been difficult to keep this country from collapsing, and it will continue to be even more difficult", said Rashid Abdi, head of the African Horn project at the International Crisis Research Group.
Ethiopia is the second most populous country in Africa after Nigeria, and its stability is maintained by the West.
The U.S. military and intelligence services work closely with Ethiopians to combat terrorist threats in the region, especially in Somalia, and virtually no country in Africa receives such support from the West.
Ethiopia's economy is growing at an impressive rate.
Its infrastructure has improved considerably  there is even a new suburban train in the capital Addis Ababa.
And her streets are usually quiet, safe and clean.
However, Ethiopia was hardly a model of democracy  human rights organizations constantly mention government repressions - the opposition on the territory of the state was suppressed, at the expense of actually silencing the dissidents.
Many of them were deported, imprisoned, killed, or driven into remote deserts.
But that could change.
"If people are constantly suppressed and left with no choice but to protest, there will be an uprising", said Seyyum Teshom, a lecturer at the university in central Ethiopia.
All the youth are protesting.
The generation is protesting.
There are many complaints, from land use to the seizure of power by the government coalition.
After a widely criticized election last year, the ruling party and its allies have completely ousted the opposition and now control 100 percent of Parliament.
At the same time, tensions along the border with Eritrea are rising; the fight for this uncertain, disputed border has claimed hundreds of lives in June.
Analysts fear that separatist groups that have been more or less destroyed in recent years, such as the Oromo Liberation Front or the Ogaden National Liberation Front, may try to use the unrest and rearm.
There are a number of reasons why the bitter feelings that have been boiling in the depths of my soul for years are now flaring up.
The first one seems to be completely harmless: smartphones.
Only in the last couple of years have a large number of Ethiopians been able to communicate on social media as cheap smartphones have become commonplace and internet services have improved.
Even when the government blocks access to Facebook and Twitter, as is often the case, especially during protests, many people still find the opportunity to communicate through proxy servers that hide where they are.
Several young Ethiopians said that this was how they organized the protests.
The second is that there is more solidarity between the Oromo and the Amhara, the two largest Ethiopian ethnic groups.
Oromo and Amhara are not natural allies.
For centuries, the Amhara of Ethiopia's predominantly Christian highland areas have flourished in politics and business, exploiting the Oromo, many of whom are Muslim and live in low-lying areas.
But it's also changing.
"We will act together under a common principle", said Mulatu Gemucu, leader of the Oromo.
The largest protests took place in Amhara and Oromo districts.
Many Amhara and Oromo feel that Ethiopia is unfairly dominated by members of the Tigray ethnic group, which makes up about 6 percent of the population and controls military and intelligence services, trade, and politics.
The third cause of concern is the loss of Meles Zenawi.
Meles, a former rebel leader, served as Ethiopia's prime minister for 17 years, until his death from an unknown illness in 2012.
He was considered a tactical genius, a man who could foresee danger.
Analysts say he was especially adept at recognizing the first signs of discontent and using intelligence to gather data and defuse adversaries.
"The current regime lacks common sense", said Abdi, a conflict analyst.
Ethiopia's new prime minister, Hailmar DeSalan, appeared out of nowhere and replaced Meles.
Unlike Meles, who was a native of the Tigray region of northern Ethiopia, Hailmarim was a southern.
Analysts say he doesn't trust the security services controlled by the Tigers.
Many fear that this will lead to even more bloodshed.
Ethiopia last experienced such unrest in 2005, after thousands of people protested what analysts said appeared to be elections that the government swallowed and then faked.
During the subsequent repressions, many protesters were killed, though in smaller numbers than in recent months, and this period of unrest passed relatively quickly.
Development experts expressed their gratitude to Ethiopia's leaders for the far-reaching development of infrastructure such as the new intercity train and significant progress in the fight against poverty.
But it obviously did not stop the growing internal discontent with the Ethiopian government.
And it takes on a dangerous ethnic form.
Last month, protesters in Gondar, a city in Amhara, attacked Tigray-owned businesses, and anti-Tigray hatred on social media is becoming widespread.
Analysts say the protesters are putting the United States and other Western allies at a disadvantage.
The U.S. government has used Ethiopia as a base for drone flights over neighboring Somalia, although it recently announced it had closed down that base.
It is clear that the West wants to support democracy, but it does not want its ally to lose strength in an already unstable region.
"And it's going to be hard to get through this tightrope", said Abdi.
Donald Trump explains his claim that ISIS was founded by Obama, "sarcasm"
Donald J. Trump tried to quell the latest conflict that swept through his campaign headquarters on Friday, claiming he was joking when he stated several times this week that President Obama and Hillary Clinton were "founders" of the Islamic State terrorist group.
The explanation raised new questions about the ability of a Republican presidential candidate to speak intelligently to the American people.
It also put his deputies, who tried to protect him during the turmoil, in a difficult position because they had to explain statements he probably did not mean.
Having made this assumption at a congress on Wednesday night, Trump insisted strongly on his assertion on Thursday, repeating in an interview that he really meant to say that the president and Clinton founded ISIS.
But in a tweet early Friday morning, Trump wrote that he was just a monk.
This post was the direct opposite of what Trump had said the day before, when he said in several interviews that he was absolutely serious about his accusation.
When conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt tried to help Trump soften his voice by reminding him that Obama wanted to destroy ISIS, the Republican presidential nominee didn't take the opportunity.
The latest scandal erupted when Trump tried to refocus his campaign on the economy amid a rating drop.
Trump and Clinton have been making competing economic speeches in Michigan this week.
On Friday, Trump tried to get back to that.
He went back to Twitter, warned that Clinton's plans would lead to tax increases, and said he found her speech boring.
Trump has used sarcasm as an excuse before.
In late July, after he had drawn widespread criticism, practically saying that the Russians should hack into Clinton's email, he later explained his remarks by saying, "Of course I'm kidding".
This approach allows Trump to go beyond what is allowed in political speech and take his words back if necessary.
"I think it's his way of testing messages that are getting a response from his fans, watching how they act, and then 'explaining' them in one direction or another, depending on the reaction", said Ruth Sherman, a communications expert who analyzed the language of both candidates.
But I also think he's careful about what he says and knows it's vague enough to be interpreted differently.
Instead of softening the voices of the general electorate, Trump has taken an even more bitter tone in recent days as his ratings continue to fall.
A new NBC/Wall Street Journal/Marist rating released on Friday showed Trump is outnumbering Clinton with a large lead in North Carolina, Virginia and Colorado and is going with it like in Florida.
Although Trump usually tries not to apologize for the provocative things he says, he often accuses his critics of misinterpreting his words and misunderstanding his sense of humor.
But as Trump has become the focus of a heightened publicity in recent months of the presidential campaign, his jokes have put his loyal allies in a position of embarrassment: they have to publicly support him, however provocative his statements may be.
Rudolf W. Giuliani, a former mayor of New York City who is one of Trump's most famous deputies, made a serious effort to defend the candidate in an interview with CNN on Thursday.
"I think what he's saying is a reasonable political commentary", Giuliani said when asked about the veracity of Trump's claim that Obama and Clinton founded the Islamic State.
It's true in the sense that before Obama, ISIS was a little little organization that was almost unknown, he called it a non-threat, absolutely unfair, and that's why it happened, because he pulled troops out of Iraq.
Most average Republicans say the Clinton administration, which was the Obama administration, allowed the CIA to develop because it failed to handle the situation in the Middle East.
Before a rally in Pennsylvania on Friday, Trump continued to attack the media on Twitter for tampering with every word he said and prejudice against him.
He mocked the "poor miserable" TV experts who tried to figure it out and said, "They're weak!"
Some Democrats have ridiculed Trump's excuses as an excess of proof that he is unfit to be president.
Once a displaced coffee shop goes back to Greenpoint .
The Werb Cafe was a barbecue, accepting cash only place in Williamsburg, which had no Wi-Fi, but served good coffee for 15 years.
Of course, she was kicked out of her window room on Bedford Avenue.
The Sherry Soup store, which took over from Werb in the summer of 2014, sells soap in the form of cakes.
The locals mourned her as the last loss in the renewed city.
Artist Molly Crabball tweeted: "New York is constantly changing, I know, but I still can't believe that CBGB is dead, Chelsea Hotel is destroyed, and Werb is now a soap store".
But while New York is constantly changing, it is also being updated.
The revived Verb opened in November of last year in Greenpoint, less than a mile north of the original location.
The new Werbe has Wi-Fi and credit cards, but it's still got some of the same staff and a similarly simple atmosphere.
Besides, the coffee's still good.
The new Verba is headed by Cisco Rodriguez, a longtime employee of the old cafe who is the owner and general manager of the new location.
He started at Werbe in 2001 and was there until the end.
When one of his clients offered to sponsor him in a new location, he said he would be happy to do so.
Rodriguez, 36, has left much behind.
Verb works with the same beagle distributor and bought the same model coffee machine.
It even has old "Verba" chandeliers.
But Rodriguez said he'd like to experiment, too.
He offered me new dishes.
The menu includes a bacon, egg and cheese sandwich and a topping of cassava or fried onion.
There's brown rice dishes.
The cafe no longer serves beer, but they now make freshly pressed juices.
Nine months later, Rodriguez said he noticed a steady stream of old regulars.
"Many of the former customers were also priced out of Williamsburg", he shared.
One of the last Sundays, Rebecca Oliver was one of those clients.
Oliveira, 34, had previously lived in Williamsburg and was a frequent visitor to the Werb.
Even after she moved to Greenpoint, she still went there.
After the Verba closed, she said she stopped drinking coffee for a while.
"I realized that it was coffee and the atmosphere that impressed me at Werbe", she said.
She's drinking coffee again, though that day, instead of her regular ice coffee, she ordered a bathed tea, another novelty.
Tom Rosenthal, another longtime client, has been a loyal visitor to the Verbe since 2003.
He would come in before work and always order the same thing.
"At fifteen o'clock every day, like on a watch, I came and my beagle was prepared for me with oil and all the fillings", he said.
Rodriguez said he wanted to experiment and put new dishes on the menu.
Today, Rosenthal still makes the usual order, but someday he'll change something with bacon, eggs, or cheese on the beige with all the fillings.
Rodriguez said he wasn't offended that the soap store once owned the old place.
Moreover, the owners of the Soup Cherry suggested making a special soap for the Verba using cold-coffeeed coffee as an ingredient.
"I think we might agree to their offer", said Rodriguez.
The Greenpoint residents of Polish origin also admired the cafe.
One of these new clients translated the menu into Polish, and Rodriguez said he planned to find a place for him in the window so his new neighbors would feel wanted.
There are other advantages to a new place.
The local juice store plans to pour bottles and sell cold-coffee.
There's a chance the cafe will attach a building next door.
For many customers, it's enough that the new Verb will include their favorite foods on the menu.
Joseph Witt was a regular and shared that he was devastated when they closed.
When the cafe opened in a new location, Witt said that when he went in and ordered a cup of coffee, he felt like he was back home.
"I've wanted to smell this smell for so long", he admitted.
The Depression Food at the Plain Meal
In March 1933, shortly after taking office, Franklin Delano Roosevelt sat down to lunch in the Oval Office.
As a gourmet, President Roosevelt loved the fashionable Fifth Avenue dishes, such as foie gras and Merrilland shrimp soup.
His menu that day was more modest: boiled eggs in tomato sauce, potatoes in purée and a dessert - blackberry pudding.
"It was an act of culinary solidarity with the people who were suffering", said Jane Siegelman.
Her husband, Andrew Coe, added: "It was also a message to Americans about how to eat".
The Brooklyn Heights couple is experts in food history.
Cowan's last book, "Ragu in Chinese", was devoted to Chinese cuisine in America, and Siegelman told the story of life in a rented apartment on the Lower East Side through food in his book "House 97 on Fruit Garden Street".
Their new collaborative work, "The Dirty Dinner", which will be published Tuesday by Harper's, is a history of American food during the Great Depression.
Showing some degree of their own culinary solidarity, they met a reporter for dinner at Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop, a tiny, simple restaurant in the Flatiron neighborhood that has been in operation since 1929, the year of the Stock Exchange crash.
Siegelman, 54, ordered butter cheese and a sandwich with olive pieces, and Coo, 57, took turkey, potatoes and a vegetable blend.
When the reporter ordered a meatball, the couple thought it was a good starting point for a discussion about food in the Depression era.
"Roulette was in high demand", said Siegelman.
There was peanut roulette, liver roulette, bean roulette.
They were made from the main ingredient and cheap products that allowed the ingredient to stretch.
Imagine that you ate as much peanuts as you need for dinner.
Coe is a bruise.
"Maybe he was lying in his stomach with a stone", he said.
In the years before the Depression, the American table, especially in rural areas, was a Swedish table.
Groups of women cooked for the male farm workers, and the freshly prepared cake was served for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.
It was the Americans who sent food to the hungry Europeans during World War I. The "Fat Dinner" describes how the country coped with what suddenly ceased to be a land of plenty.
"It was a time when food became a central, difficult topic for Americans", Coe said, explaining why he and his wife decided to write about it.
The new budgetary diet was also not as simple: mysterious dishes such as roulette and baked goods became staples; baked goods were "a great way to make use of the packaging", Zigelman noted, because cooks could hide unappetizing ingredients under a thick layer of sauce.
Fresh fruit was replaced by cheaper dried fruit.
Meat, for many years the staple of American food, has become a luxury that is being distributed in an economical manner.
People tried strange blends because energy and nutritional value became more important than taste and even culinary common sense.
While researching a book that included recipes, Siegelman prepared a dish of the era: baked onions, stuffed with peanut butter.
"This addition to the lunch table was not successful", said Coe.
Siegelman added: "It was very strange".
Peanut butter is not a good fit for baked onions.
This was typical of many homemade recipes.
Never before and never since, homeowners, including Louise Stanley, head of the Federal Homeownership Bureau from 1923 to 1943, have been managing the country's eating habits.
By publishing recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines, they advised women to become "budget makers", to take the challenge and turn a bowl of fried carrots into a delicious meal.
A "dense meal" is a feast of curious historical facts.
Specifically, the government's response to starving citizens is spicy, with President Herbert Hoover's "let's eat cakes" attitude.
Publicly hailed as a simple Iowa farmer's apprentice from his childhood, he was a well-rounded millionaire.
"He liked continental cuisine, like fish with cucumber sauce", Coe said.
He was eating in a gold-plated dining room, wearing a tuxedo.
He was fantastically detached from reality.
President Roosevelt could have made the same mistake if his wife Eleanor hadn't advised him to set an example with his own stomach.
According to the book, Eleanor Roosevelt hired an economist who had no interest in taste at all, and this led the White House to "eat not only the most disgusting food in Washington, but sometimes the most disgustingly cooked".
Many of the Depression-era cooking techniques were forgotten as soon as the country got back on its feet.
Their legacy  is our constant focus on calories and nutrients, says Siegelman, and how science has been used in cooking.
The couple said that while writing the book, they understood the eating habits of Siegelman's mother, that she couldn't throw food away, for example.
"She was seriously afraid of being neglected", Coe said.
Siegelman recalls, "She was seriously poisoning people".
There was one bad case with the pro-patrol.
When the plates at Eisenberg's were empty, Coe and I got a home-cooked dessert: a blackberry dessert that President Roosevelt ate for lunch.
"It's called mustard moss", Siegelman said, adding that it was a common practice to give modest recipes a name.
There was no cream, only mustard, a little flour, sugar, water and cinnamon.
Everyone reluctantly dipped the spoon in a sticky, brown, sticky substance.
Surprisingly, it was good.
Coe asked for supplements twice.
With a confident budget writer's voice, he told his wife, "A little sliced nuts would be fine".
The arrest of the defendants in the case of mass fighting at the Hovan cemetery has been extended until November 14
The Presne court has placed the defendants in custody until November 14 of the case of the mass fight at the Hovan cemetery, satisfying the investigation's request.
There are 14 defendants in the case.
Recall that on May 14th, a mass fight took place at the Hovan Cemetery, where several hundred people from Central Asia and the North Caucasus used weapons, killing three people.
Former cemetery manager Yuri Chabeev and lawyer, co-founder of the "Healthy Nation" organization Alexander Bocharnikov are charged with organizing murder.
The second pension indexation for 2016 could be resolved within the next two to three weeks.
This was reported on August 12 by the Deputy Chairman of the Russian Government Olga Golodets during her visit to Brynsk region.
We have specific parameters for how much more pension needs to be raised to lower the inflation that exists in the country.
All the calculations are done.
Now economists are summarizing the half-year, and we will complete this work within the next two to three weeks", - quotes Hunger.
Commenting on the scheme proposed by the head of the Center for Strategic Development Alexei Kudrin to raise the retirement age by six months each year, the vice-premier said that the cabinet does not consider this topic.
In late July, it was reported that the Government had agreed on a position on the full indexation of pension payments in 2017.
Kamensky and Grigoryan reached the final of the competition for small-caliber rifles.
Russian athletes Sergey Kamensky and Kirill Grigoryan reached the final of the shooting competition from a small-caliber rifle from the position of a couch at the Olympic Games in Brazil.
According to TASS, Sergei Kamensky scored 629 points and took first place - a new Olympic record in qualifying.
Kirill Grigorian came in second with 628.9 points.
A total of eight top athletes made it to the final.
Kamensky is the world record holder in this discipline (633).
Turkish opposition leader Fethullah Gülen demands an international investigation into the circumstances of the attempted coup in Turkey.
"I demand that an independent international commission investigate the coup attempt", quotes Guillain as saying in the French newspaper Le Monde.
The Turkish opposition official also said that "if some of the charges are confirmed, I will return to Turkey".
However, Gülen denies any involvement in the coup, stressing that his organization has never claimed political power.
The Istanbul court had earlier arrested the opposition Islamic preacher Fethullah Gülen on bail.
We recall that the military coup attempt took place in Turkey on the night of July 15 to 16.
Gilead will reimburse the costs of advocacy services during the hepatitis C patent dispute with Merck .
Gilead Sciences Inc. is entitled to reimbursement for the legal fees it incurred in a patent lawsuit against drug manufacturer Merck & Co Inc. for hepatitis C, the federal district judge ruled.
In June Gilead was exempted from paying $200 million in damages for violating two Merck patents relating to Gilead's drugs, sales leaders Sovaldi and Harvoni, after an American judge found a number of violations by Merck, including lying under oath and other unethical conduct.
U.S. District Judge Beth Labson Freeman said in a lawsuit Thursday that Gilead was entitled to compensation for the costs of the litigation.
Merck is trying to catch up with Gilead, which dominates the market for a new generation of hepatitis C drugs that can cure more than 90 percent of patients with liver disease.
The case took place in 2013 when Gilead and Merck sued each other for claims to laboratory work underlying the sofosbuvir, an active ingredient in Gilead's medicines.
The US-backed armed forces claim to have taken full control of Manbij from the Islamic State.
The U.S.-backed armed forces have seized full control of the northern city of Manbij near the Turkish border after the last remaining Islamic State militants left the city, a group spokesman said Friday.
The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) are now clearing the city after the remaining group of militants who were hiding in the city were evacuated.
They have freed more than 2,000 civilian hostages held by militants, Sharfan Darwish of the SDS-allied Manbij Military Council told Reuters.
"The city is now completely under our control, but we are conducting cleanup operations", he told Reuters.
Clinton earned $10.75 million in 2015 and paid 34.2 percent of the federal tax rate .
Hillary Clinton on Friday released her 2015 tax returns, which showed that the Democratic presidential nominee and her husband had $10.75 million in income this year and paid an effective federal tax rate of 34.2 percent.
In 2015, Clinton received $1 million in charitable contributions, mostly to the Clinton Foundation, former President Bill Clinton received about $5.3 million in honors for his speech, and the former secretary of state reported $3 million in income from Simon & Schuster for her book about her time in the State Department.
Potential Vice President Clinton, U.S. Senator Tim Kane of Virginia, along with his wife, Anna Halton, released tax returns for 10 years.
In 2015, they paid an effective federal tax rate of 20.3 percent.
"Hillary Clinton and Tim Kane continue to set the standard for financial transparency", Clinton campaign chief Jennifer Palmieri said in a statement.
In stark contrast, Donald Trump is hiding behind false excuses and breaking his past promises to release his tax returns.
It's common for candidates for U.S. presidents to publish their tax returns, even though the law doesn't require them to.
New York businessman Trump and his lawyers cited the State Tax Service's audit as the reason he refused to release his tax returns.
"Your move", tweeted Clinton campaign chief Jan Sams, referring to the Democratic Party nominee's declaration.
On Thursday, Trump's special counsel, Michael Cohen, told CNN that he would not allow Trump to release them until the end of the investigation.
Trump's critics, including 2012 Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney and other fellow Republicans, said his refusal raised questions about his condition, his charitable contributions, his business operations, and other ties, including to Russia.
Clinton took this issue to heart and on Friday posted an online video that featured prominent Republicans who were persuading Trump to release his tax returns.
She raised this issue Thursday during an economic talk in Michigan.
"He refuses to do what every candidate for president has done for decades: publish his tax returns", she told the crowd.
Politico reported that Trump paid no or almost no taxes for two years in the 1990s, and a New York Times business analyst quoted many tax attorneys and accountants on Friday as saying that things may still be the same.
Federal tax rates have been the subject of controversy in the presidential election.
Clinton supported a rule named after billionaire investor Warren Buffett that would guarantee that people earning more than $1 million a year would pay a tax rate of at least 30 percent.
President Barack Obama also supported the proposal.
At a meeting with Clinton last week in Omaha, Nebraska, Buffett, whose conglomerate Berkshire Hathaway is based there, offered Trump a meeting and exchange tax returns.
Buffett said he's under IRS scrutiny too, and that Trump is "scared" not of the tax agency, but of the voters.
Clinton's campaign headquarters published tax returns until 2007.
The Clintons, who now live in Chappaqua, New York, paid an average federal tax rate of about 32 percent from 2007 to 2014 and an effective tax rate of about 40.5 percent.
The 2015 Clinton Declaration showed that, unlike most Americans, only $100 of their income came from wages.
Their primary investment was a low-cost index mutual fund, and the Clintons announced dividends and capital gains of $109,000.

Condoms with chili powder and fireworks improve the protection of Tanzanian elephants
Environmentalists in Tanzania use an unconventional method to prevent elephants from entering settlements  throwing condoms filled with chili powder into them.
The method proved effective, and the Honeyguide Foundation, which came up with the idea a few years ago, together with the U.S. Committee on the Environment, took it to the next level by training volunteers in rural northern Tanzania to use a nonviolent, four-step approach to protect their homes and crops without harming animals.
In the past, many people used spears to protect themselves.
On Friday, there will be World Elephant Day dedicated to animal protection.
"Since we invented the toolkit... we've seen a shift in attitudes within these communities, making them much more confident that they can keep elephants off their fields without harming them", Honeyguide CEO Damien Bell said in a statement.
The first two steps are to light a torch before the elephant breaks the border and to signal with the horn.
If he can't be scared off, they throw away the so-called "Chile cloud".
Chili powder mixed with soil is placed with a cotton ball in a condom, and the end is rolled around, leaving only the felt.
When the condoms are lit, they burst with a roar, spraying a small amount of dust into the air.
One blow is usually enough to turn the elephant in the other direction.
The extreme measure is a launch device that fires Roman candles into the air, producing a loud, bright explosion.
Turkey has not yet returned 32 Turkish diplomats who left the country after a coup attempt in July this year.
This was reported by the Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu in a conversation with local journalists.
In the first phase, we recalled 208 diplomats to continue their work at the center.
Of these, 32 people have not returned without objective reasons or explanations", the head of the Turkish foreign ministry said.
Recall that in July, there was an attempted coup in Turkey.
The authorities of the country officially declared that the coup had failed, and also reported the detention of more than six thousand people, including military ranks of the upper and middle ranks.
As a result of the coup attempt, 290 people died, according to the Turkish Foreign Ministry.
Jewish director sharply criticized Berlin hotel for removing Israel's phone code at "request" of Arabs  reported RT News channel
A French director of Jewish descent has unleashed a media scandal after discovering that the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin does not have Israel's phone number on its list, with the staff referring to "requests" from Arab customers.
Claude Lantzman, author of the documentary film Shoah, expressed his displeasure with the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin, writing an open letter to German media outlet FAZ.
During his recent stay at the hotel, Lanzman tried to find Israel in the hotel's phone number list.
The country, however, was not mentioned among the states where you can call directly from the room.
How could it be that in 2016 in Berlin, the capital of the new Germany, Israel was excluded and eradicated?
It was written by Lantzman.
Instead, Kempinski Bristol is offering the opportunity to contact Israel through its own call center.
In search of an explanation, the director raised the question at the hotel's administration counter.
The answer he received there, according to Lantzman, "shocked him".
The hotel clerk said the move was "a deliberate decision by the management of the Kempinski hotel chain".
The reason behind this move has caused the director's anger to grow even more.
"Most of our guests are Arabs, and they demanded that the code of Israel be removed", said, according to Lanzmann, a hotel attendant.
Israel's ambassador to Germany, Jacob Hadas-Handelsman, called the case a "terrible shame", reports the newspaper Suddeutsche Zeitung.
We were shocked and shocked by the incident.
It's a shame, actually.
What happened in Germany, and in this hotel chain, is a shame.
No explanation is needed here.
We expect the hotel to draw the right conclusions", the official said.
The case has caused a lot of controversy on the Internet; people have called it a scandal.
Some argued that the Kempinski Hotel simply "went on purpose" to the alleged demands of Arab customers.
"Would be ashamed", another post said, pointing out that the hotel, located on the famous Kurfurstendamm street, is near the synagogue.
The hotel has quickly denied any allegations, calling the incident a "misreading" and "apologizing" to Lantzman, reports Der Spiegel newspaper.
"There was no direct order not to include Israel in the list of fast-track",  quotes a representative of the Kempinski hotel newspaper Suddeutsche Zeitung.
She adds that the code has now been added.
Police use tear gas and rubber bullets against protesting Brazilian students
Students clashed with police in the Brazilian city of São Paulo on Thursday as they gathered to protest government reforms of the public education system.
Police used tear gas and rubber bullets against protesters.
The riots began when police officers tried to disperse students, resulting in police using rubber bullets and tear gas.
Several hundred students took part in the demonstration to express their concerns about the plans.
Under the proposal of São Paulo Governor Geraldo Alckmin, nearly 100 public high schools will be closed and 300,000 students will be redistributed to save money.
Some protestors were seen writing graffiti on the walls against incumbent President Michael Temer.
The latest protests came just days after protesters took to the streets to support ousted President Dilma Rousseff, who was impeached by the country's Senate.
Trade between Russia and Iran has increased by 71 percent  reports RT Business portal
With the lifting of sanctions, trade between Moscow and Tehran increased by 70.9 percent compared to the previous year, according to Russia's ambassador to Iran, Levan Jagarian.
As international sanctions against Iran have been lifted, there is growing interest from Russian firms in doing business in the country, the ambassador said.
Russian companies are re-establishing ties with Iran, and new firms are ready to access the market.
Of course, further expansion of trade is one of the main priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran",  said Jagarian.
He noted that in the first five months of 2016, the trade turnover between Russia and Iran increased by 70.9 percent compared to the same period in 2015 and amounted to 856 million dollars.
In particular, Russian exports to Iran grew 91.5 percent to $697 million.
Russian imports from Iran increased by 16 percent to $158 million.
The increase in trade was achieved through the supply of machinery, ground vehicles and weapons", the ambassador said.
Jagarian also predicts that a record number of Iranian tourists will visit Russia this year.
Last year, the Russian diplomatic mission in Iran issued about 35,000 visas, mostly tourist, to Iranian citizens.
In addition, Iran has entered the top 20 countries for the first time in terms of the number of tourists visiting Russia.
We can say with confidence that last year's record for the number of Iranian tourists visiting Russia will be broken", he said.
At the same time, relatively few Russians visit Iran, which the ambassador hopes will change.
"I personally recommend visiting the cities of Isfahan, Shiraz and Yez, which have preserved monuments of ancient Persian civilization in good condition", he said.
The state continues to spin the gauntlet in the defense-industrial complex.
The reason for the dismissal was the "systematic failure" of the general director of the Almaz-Antey concern, "missing in the work" and "loss of trust".
The head of the NGO for the next three years is appointed by Gennady Bendersky.
The news of Neskorodov's firing came out on Thursday night and did not cause a wide resonance in the media.
What could explain such a silence in the face of a massive rearmament of the army?
Most likely, the Russian leadership does not want any rumors or negative assumptions to be spread in public.
This proves once again that the defense industrial complex (DIP) has many problems and the state does not want to attract increased public attention to them.
The removal of Neskorodov is undoubtedly an important event in order to bring order to the industry.
"Almaz" is the main enterprise of the company, which specializes in the production of naval and ground based anti-aircraft missile systems (ASM).
Currently, "Almaz" is working on the creation of the "Poliment-Redut" and "Morpheus" ZRKs, which are planned to be installed on new corvettes, frigates, destroyers and cruisers.
Military Russia portal founder Dmitry Kornev believes that the dismissal of Neskorodov is caused by the breakup of the deadlines for these projects.
This is the most logical version.
For example, the development of Morpheus began in 2007, and the project was scheduled to be commissioned in 2013.
The Polym-Redut is to become the primary air defense system on the Navy's newest ships.
I'm getting information that in the last few years, there hasn't been a single really successful test.
"The truth is that I can't say that it's the fault of Almaz", Kornev said.
The expert fears that the delay in commissioning could also occur with the S-500 ZRK.
Experimental and design work on the project is still not completed, but the first complexes should be delivered to the army in 2016.
The Ministry of Defense says "the work is being planned and everything will be completed within the deadline", although in 2014 the agency acknowledged the problems with the development of the S-500.
It is extremely difficult to assess the professional qualities of Neskorodov, who has been running "Almaz" since 2011.
Kornev noted that the interruption of the deadlines on the projects could be both a reason and a reason for dismissal.
He said it was extremely difficult to get information about the internal processes in the PPP and the plans of the management of the enterprises.
The industry has received long-term orders of tens of billions of rubles, and big money, as we know, loves silence.
Generally, the directors of defense companies leave their positions on their own initiative, by agreement of the parties, or are transferred to another job.
In this case, the removal was public, although it did not get a resonance.
This suggests that the head of the Almaz may have been a strong figure who resisted the discharges coming from above.
It seems that the state no longer intends to tolerate such behavior.
It will use shareholders to remove those who prefer to dispute the Department of Defense's policies and fail to meet their objectives.
At the same time, the Russian Federation is seeking to punish the wired managers (the machinations at the "Star" shipyard).
The President himself pays more attention to the problems of the sector.
Vladimir Putin heads the Military-Industrial Commission and regularly holds meetings dedicated to rearmament.
The Kremlin is defending the ranks of the OPC managers, seeking to have a loyal directorship at their disposal to carry out orders from above.
This is far from ideal policy, but with the rampant corruption and lack of normal competition in the CCP, the state has no other tools.
The situation in defense is not catastrophic, of course, but the current geopolitical situation encourages the Kremlin to bring the armed forces into order as soon as possible.
Parallel to the "cleansing" of the operatives in the OPC, the Russian leadership is taking quite successful steps to increase the professionalism of the Russian troops.
The army's personnel has gained a new quality with the arrival of Sergei Shoigu as defense minister.
It seems that the president has adopted the famous saying "If you want peace, prepare for war".
During the Cold War, the Soviet Union's military might and the nuclear parity achieved in the 1970s led to the conclusion of the Helsinki Pact, which consolidated Moscow's sphere of influence on the continent.
Despite the shortcomings of the bipolar system, it worked quite efficiently.
The absence of wars on the European continent and the relatively stable situation in the Middle East are proof of this.
The celebration of the "victorians" in the Cold War eventually turned into a strengthening of international terrorism.
After a series of terrorist attacks in Europe and the United States in the "civilized world", there seems to be no quiet corner left.
Despite the common misfortune, the West refuses to talk to Russia on an equal partner level.
Under these conditions, the Navy and the army remain our country's only allies.
The strengthening of military power will allow Moscow to defend its national interests more effectively and to reach new frontiers in world politics.
Scot Callum Skinner races on a finish line, resulting in the British capturing the bike gold.
Scottishman Callum Skinner was racing to victory in the men's team sprint at the Rio bike rink last night, which resulted in the team trio of Great Britain defending their title from London 2012.
The 23-year-old Glasgow native was in the role of the strongest, which his Scottish friend Sir Chris Hoy made his own, and the young man proudly made history by jumping the finish line to take the win from the New Zealand favourite team.
Britain claimed the unexpected victory four years ago, winning when Howe claimed the fifth of his six Olympic gold medals.
And they repeated the trick after finishing modestly sixth at the March World Cycling Championships in London, despite Hoye's career ending.
The issue between Beijing and London was the replacement of the participant Jamie Staff.
They did it right when the Hindes came along.
Hoya's care also created a void that Kian Emady and Matt Crampton tried to fill.
Skinner was a man who was held by British coaches, seeing the potential in the Scotsman that was now being realized.
Hinde's, Kenny's  champions with Hoye four years ago  and Skinner set an Olympic record in qualifying, but the norm was beaten by New Zealand in the first round.
And the British trio won the gold duel.
Hindes was definitely behind his lap, but Kenny pushed the team forward, and Skinner was supportive.
The change in strategy was a big part of the transformation where Hindes drove on a bigger transmission to slow down and allow Kenny and, in particular, Skinner to keep pace.
Hoey watched from his seat as a guest expert on the BBC and caught the gaze of Skinner, Kenny and Hindes as they stepped onto the pedestal.
Skinner, 23, from Glasgow, said, "It's a step-by-step comparison".
I'm here to do my best and make a name for myself.
We set an Olympic record in the final and beat the world champions.
It was amazing.
There's no better way to win.
After a 2012 London triumph alongside Kenny and Hoye, Hindes admitted to deliberately falling onto the track after a failed start.
He later declined to comment, and there was no way to appeal from the UK competitors.
There was no such question this time in the greatest victory.
Hindes said, "I felt like I was in London with all those British flags on the podium".
We've all been together as a team for the last three months.
We've lost so many world-famous races, winning the Olympics again was just amazing.
It's one event, one gold medal for a country that has won seven of the 10 titles in both Beijing and London.
If this is a barometer of progress made in the last five months, then the bike is expected to have five more successful days.
With the form Kenny has shown, it's not beyond the imagination that he's repeating Hoye's feat of winning three Olympic gold medals at the same Games.
This would have seen Kenny  who is exactly 12 years younger than Hoey, who was also born on March 23 (it seems to be a holy date in British sports, which is also the birthday of Steve Redgrave, Moe Farha and Roger Bannister)  bring his score to six gold medals and one silver.
It would be like Hoya.
Next time, Kenny's competing in the sprint, which starts today and runs for three days.
A 28-year-old Bolton man said, "I'm just enjoying it right now.
Team competitions are always the best.
You come to win with your comrades.
A little lonely to win alone, to be honest.
Hindes said, "If he wins two more gold medals, he should get knighthood".
It was the only medal game of the day, but there was good news for Britain.
Sir Bradley Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Stephen Burke and Owen Dull qualified for the fastest four-mile team pursuit race of the four.
They finished with a time of 3:51.943.
The world record set by London 2012 gold is 3:51.659.
The first round and final (10:42 p.m.) will be held today, the second day of the event, with Wiggins definitely in the spotlight.
He had a discussion with the commissioners yesterday, on the eve of the qualifying race, when officials asked him to measure his weight.
In the women's event, which is resumed and concluding tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanna Roussel Shand, Eleanor Barker and Katy Archibald of Milnaway improved the world record by posting a time of 4:13.260.
Team Great Britain has come to rely on a powerful cycling team to take over the mid-Olympic period and earn a bunch of medals.
After the truly exceptional demonstrations of total superiority in Beijing and London, expectations weakened in the gradual preparation for Rio.
There were dramas in the background, not the last - the departure of technical director Shane Sutton in April over accusations of sexism and harassment, and the departures of major figures such as Hoey and Victoria Pendleton.
However, based on the first night of the race on the track, it seems that Britain's now legendary claim to the top in time may well be repeated again.
The future of the Portland metallurgical plant is under threat due to the termination of the contract for electricity
The future of the Portland aluminum plant in Victoria  and hundreds of jobs  are at stake because the electricity company that supplies the plant, according to one of the plant's owners, is about to terminate the supply contract: it is planned that all supply contracts will be terminated.
This move is a result of a decision earlier this year by the Victorian government not to extend subsidies to support the plant's operations.
The fixed 20-year subsidy expires in November.
Up to 2,000 jobs could be at risk at Alcoa's plant in Portland.
As many as 2,000 jobs could be directly or indirectly at risk as a result of any closure.
There may also be additional side effects, as the steel mill consumes about 10 percent of all electricity produced in Victoria.
In 2014, Alcoa closed its Point Henry steel plant, which led to the closure of the power plant in Anglesey last year.
Alcoa's Portland steel plant is losing money and risking closure.
These actions were the result of years of deliberation about the future of the plant, initially due to the strong position of the Australian dollar, and later, due to the price of the plant's products.
AGL, which supplies electricity to a large aluminum plant from its Loy Yang A power plant in Latrobe Valley, said it expects the other three owners to take steps to terminate the contract as well.
The controlling stake in the plant is owned by the short-term joint venture of Alcoa and Alumina, while the Chinese CITIC and Japanese Marubeni Corp have smaller stakes.
"AGL expects the Portland facility to continue operating, meaning that the physical demand for electricity from the steel plant will not stop", she said.
According to AGL, the contracts mentioned are so-called 'hedged contracts' which were to come into force in November 2016.
Contracts have a 12-month termination period, so they're actually going to end in 2017.
"Accordingly, AGL still expects these contracts to bring their share of revenue in the 2017 financial year", the electric utility company said.
Any potential impact on AGL's profits from the 2018 financial year is currently limited to forecasts for a strong wholesale electricity futures market.
AGL said it had already reduced the amount of contracts in its reporting by $187 million in anticipation of "the upcoming termination".
According to Alcoa, the decision to terminate the contracts "does not affect Alcoa's ability to run a steel plant or provide electricity to a steel plant".
The American company said it had signed a 20-year contract with Loy Yang in 2010, which was due to come into force in November of this year, but it still has to explain why it terminated the contract.
Analysts feared the potential closure of both the Portland metallurgical plant in Victoria and the Tomago plant near Newcastle due to the unfavorable economic situation in the industry.
Speaking to analysts earlier this week, AGL Chief Operating Officer Steven Mickelson said Portland uses about 600 megawatts of power annually, and Tomago uses about 900 megawatts.
If both of these plants go out of business, there will be a significant decline in demand in the market.
For us as a producer, it will be bad", he said.
Not only reality star Kardashian, Kendall on the cover of the September issue of Vogue
Kendall Jenner, 20, model and fourth daughter of the Kardashian-Jenner clan, manager Chris, appeared on the covers of the coveted September issue of American Vogue magazine.
Kendall, who is the face of the Estee Lauder brand and has been featured at fashion weeks in Milan, Paris and New York, reported the news on her Instagram account on Thursday.
"While in a room with my favorite people, I looked at this cover and cried", wrote Kendall.
The cover was accompanied by a strange (or simply in the spirit of the Kardashian Family?), prepared reality-video in which the entire Kardashian-Jenner family (deboushers Rob and Kaitlin, also joined by the show business's all-time favorite uncle, producer Ryan Seacrest), forgot about the appearance of their sister on the cover, and at the end - a classic twist: they planned a surprise party.
This is the standard storyline for almost all episodes of children's television shows dedicated to birthdays (Sicrates says "Did you think we forgot about you?" with the sincerity of the 8 a.m. animated rabbit in the show), but Chris needed to get that fame to other girls anyway.
Because with this episode of the September issue of Vogue, we have undoubtedly entered a new era of Kardashian shows.
May her older sister Kendall Kim have been on the cover of Vogue earlier (she appeared on it with her husband Kanye West in April 2014), but the September cover of the magazine is an achievement in itself.
The September issue is Vogue's best-selling issue of the year.
With a thickness more like a gift edition than a fashion magazine, the issue attracts a huge number of advertisers (according to the calculations of the Fashionista portal, 615 pages from last year's 832-page edition contained advertising).
News of who will be on the cover is so eagerly awaited that in the past two years, the magazine's photos have been merged into the official announcement.
Previous women on the cover include Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelist, and Kate Moss.
In recent years, the cover has certainly featured more "models who work as celebrities" than "models who are celebrities".
Oscar winner and Dior brand face Jennifer Lawrence was featured on the cover in 2013, a year after Lady Gaga was given the honor.
But even in the unlikely event that Jenner, described by the magazine as the "outstanding model" of her generation, falls into the top category, she's in good company.
These celebrities are not relatives of famous people, reality stars, or modern kids who know how to make a good video on Snapchat (although Jenner falls into all of these categories).
These are really talented women who are making it in the entertainment industry.
For Beyonce, who appeared on the cover last year, this year was one of the most successful in her career due to the release of Lemonade.
Of course, not everyone is happy about Jenner's success.
Jenner's position in the fashion world, given her past reality TV star, should have always remained shaky.
In June, one of Victoria's Secret's first models, Stephanie Seymour, criticized Jenner and her colleague Gigi Hadid as "moment-bitches".
This mood was up again after the news of Jenner's appearance on the cover of Vogue.
But there's no point in getting stuck in dissatisfaction.
Kendall Jenner on the cover of the September issue of Vogue.
She's a supermodel in every sense of the word.
She's out for Mark Jacobs.
She sells you toner cream from Estee Lauder.
She and all her sisters sell you their photos on their own apps, available for a paid subscription.
She sells hand-made photos of Cindy Crawford's daughter to LOVE magazine.
And in her spare time, perhaps to still see her sister Courtney and her children, she's in reality TV.
Public law centers refuse to serve 160 000 people a year
Each year, more than 160,000 of the least-protected population refuses to attend public law centres as the sector prepares for the effect that will further reduce funding for already limited activities.
In Queensland, three out of five people  mostly elderly, immigrants, unprotected workers, victims of violence, people who cannot fight unfair deprivation of property and so on  have already been denied legal aid and representation.
Public legal services already operating beyond their means are preparing for further cuts.
Starting next June, these law firms are expected to lose another 30 percent of federal funding.
The director of Queensland Public Law Centres, James Farrell, said that according to the latest National Association of Public Law Centres census report, thousands of people are denied a job every year.
Farrell said if the federal government's decision isn't reversed, the situation will only get worse.
"Queensland's public law centres are constantly underfunded, meaning thousands of people are denied vital services", he said.
People who are leaving violent relationships, people with unmanageable and bankrupt debts, families going through divorce, unfairly dismissed workers -- all of these people have legal problems, and this report shows that they can't get the help they need.
The federal government will cut funding by 30 percent from June 2017, meaning thousands of less protected residents in Queensland will be forced to handle complex legal issues without help.
We call on the Minister of Justice and Queensland Senator George Brandeis to immediately cancel these funding cuts so that people can get the help they need when they face legal challenges.
Last year, the state government fulfilled its commitment to raise funding for free legal aid to the national average.
Now it's time to address the needs of public law firms and communities, their clients, and the Palatschuk government to get involved in this important work.
Donald Trump's campaign headquarters is being sued after an employee allegedly threatened with a gun.
According to reports from New York, Donald Trump's campaign headquarters was sued, with the headquarters allegedly doing nothing after reports that its North Carolina operations director had threatened an employee with a gun while they were driving in a jeep in February.
The incident was described in a lawsuit filed Wednesday in Charlotte's state court by Vincent Bordini, a former software instructor at the state's election headquarters.
Bordini said he waited months for the issue to be resolved internally, but realized "it's not going to happen".
Director Earl Phillip "extracted the gun, put his right index finger on the hook and directed the dowel at Vincent's kneecap", Bordini claims in the complaint.
Complaining to the local and regional headquarters, Bordini realized that at least four other people had been involved in similar incidents with Phillip, the appeal claims.
"Guns don't have to shoot to cause harm", Bordini said in the complaint.
The lawsuit came just two days after Republican presidential candidate made a fuss, telling listeners in North Carolina that "People of the Second Amendment"  understood as gun owners and gun lovers  could start acting if his rival Hillary Clinton were elected and could choose judges.
Trump's campaign said the media took his words out of context and that he did not speak in support of violence.
In his complaint, Bordini demands compensation from the pre-election staff for negligent control and from Phillip for the threat of physical violence, offense by action and moral harm.
Trump spokesman Hope Hicks is delaying responding to a request for comment.
Attempts to talk to Phillip failed.
WCCB, a local news partner in Charlotte, said Phillip recently left the campaign headquarters.
In response to a call to his consulting firm, Innovation Consulting Services, no one called back quickly.
Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has run a controversial campaign.
Case: Bordini v. Donald J. Trump For President Inc., 16-CS-14300, General Court, division of the High Court of the Mecklenburg County (Charlotte).
Britain must direct the Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow .
Heathrow will also bring revival and prosperity not only to our local communities and to London as a whole, but to the whole country.
I think that was the huge advantage of Heathrow, just like it was in London in 2012, where we put all our efforts into making sure our peoples and regions benefited from the Games.
The Olympics were a huge benefit to Stratford and the East End.
And we're going to do it again by creating opportunities for local residents and businesses around Heathrow.
For our local communities alone, we will create 10,000 new traineeships, 40,000 new jobs and end youth unemployment around the airport.
As with London 2012, there will be those who think the Heathrow expansion is too big.
I was told that Britain would never be ready for the Olympics and that we would be in a difficult position on the world stage.
Skeptics were wrong in 2012, and they're gonna prove wrong about Heathrow.
There are always obstacles to overcome, but Heathrow answers every question asked about him.
Like the Olympic Games, Heathrow is an infrastructure project for most, not just a narrow circle.
Expansion  is an opportunity to create up to 180,000 new jobs, £211 billion of economic growth, leaving behind a legacy of skills and employment both around the airport and across the UK.
We have a great team in Heathrow that has implemented a £11 billion infrastructure investment program on time and within budget, from T5 which has been voted the best airport terminal for five years running, to T2 built in the middle of the world's two busiest runways.
Now they're ready to secure a third runway, backed by 16 billion pounds of private investment.
The London 2012 Olympics were a huge success for Great Britain, and I'm sure Heathrow's expansion will be, too.
It's time for us to put the Olympic spirit on track and expand Heathrow, securing our trading future and creating a legacy of skills and employment that Britain can be proud of.
Lord Paul Dayton  Chairman of the Heathrow Council and former Trade Attorney of the Treasury
Adblock Plus, Facebook is playing cat-and-mouse on the issue of ad blocking
For companies that make money from online advertising, trying to circumvent ad blocking software is a "cat-and-mouse game", according to one of the companies that build the software.
On Thursday, just a few days after Facebook announced it was going to block ad blockers on its desktop version of the site, Adblock Plus posted a blog post that users can update their filters in the app to block ads on the social network again.
Facebook announced Tuesday that the desktop version of the site will change the loop around its ads to make it harder for ad blockers to recognize which parts of the page are ads.
But Adblock now claims to have managed to bypass the new code.
In a blog post, Adblock spokesman Ben Williams wrote that "this kind of mutual struggle between the open source ad blocker community and those trying to get around it has been going on since the ad blocking was invented", and that Facebook may soon present its own solution.
The fact that the world's largest social network has entered the fight is a clear indication of how big a problem advertising blockers have become for the industry.
Around the world, some 200 million people use ad blocker, according to a study by Pagefair and Adobe last year; nearly four times the number who used the software in 2013.
With 1.3 billion daily active users who log on to Facebook via mobile devices, mobile advertising now accounts for 84 percent of Facebook's advertising revenue.
However, the company is hunting for ad blockers on the desktop version, as mobile ad blockers are ineffective in Facebook's social networking and Instagram mobile apps, according to the spokesperson.
But the desktop ads are still a lucrative article enough for Facebook to consider it a profitable investment.
Facebook also announced on Thursday that it is updating its "ad preferences" tool to give people more control over how ads are targeted.
Facebook said on Thursday that the new Adblock filters are a cause for concern, as they will also block some non-advertising content on the site.
"It won't be a positive experience for people, and we plan to solve this problem", a Facebook spokesman said in an official email.
Ad blockers are a rough tool, so instead we focused on creating tools like Ad Preferences to hand control over to people.
Woman was moved to a Swiss highway in an apparent suicide
Victim was lying on the freeway in the middle of the night.
Police are calling witnesses after a woman was hit by multiple vehicles on the freeway early Thursday morning in an apparent suicide attempt.
The incident occurred on the A1 near Morge in canton Wo just after midnight on Thursday.
The woman lay on the road in the dark "in a gesture of despair" and was hit by several vehicles, police said in a statement.
Apparently trying to kill himself, the victim, a 49-year-old Swiss woman, was hit by several vehicles, including a truck.
She died on the spot.
Several drivers have been questioned, but some have not yet been identified, police said, calling on them and others who witnessed the crash to respond.
A criminal case was launched, a "logical" step in such a situation, said lawyer Gille Hofstetter Le Tribune de Geneve.
However, it remains to be seen whether any of the drivers involved will be charged.
Was it possible to avoid the strike?
That's what the prosecutor has to decide", Hofstadter said.
Two other similar incidents in the past five years suggest that drivers will not be held accountable.
In each case, both involve a person walking in the dark on the highway, the court ruled that motorists cannot expect an accidental encounter with a pedestrian on the highway in the middle of the night, the newspaper reports.
Last year, an officer was acquitted of causing death by negligence after she struck and killed a man lying on the A1 near Payern on the night of August 2014.
22-year-old victim was drinking and passed out on the road, court heard.
The court found that the female police officer who responded to the emergency call was driving the vehicle in a manner that was justified and that the presence of a person on the road was "a completely exceptional and unpredictable situation", the judge said.
Anyone with information about Thursday's incident near Morge should call the police at 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44.
NASA's climate model: Venus was once inhabited
Venus may have once been inhabited, according to NASA's new climate model estimates.
Scientists at the Goddard Space Institute in Nashville have developed a model for studying Venus' past using tools and algorithms similar to those used by climate scientists.
The model was developed to determine whether Venus, with its hot, waterless surface and carbon-intensive atmosphere, could ever have conditions like Earth's.
Scientists previously assumed that Venus's small rotation rate was due to its dense atmosphere.
But the latest modeling suggests that Venus may have had a thin atmosphere similar to Earth's, but still rotated slowly.
The model also examined the topography of early Venus.
There were probably more arid regions on the planet than on Earth, but there was once enough water and enough geographic variability to create conditions for life and prevent rapid evaporation.
Early Venus also benefited from the sun, which was 30 percent darker.
"According to the GISS model, Venus's slow rotation puts its solar side under the sun for almost two months at a time", GISS scientist Anthony Del Henio explained in a press release.
It warms the planet's surface and produces rain, which creates a thick layer of clouds that acts as an umbrella to protect the planet's surface from much of the sun's heat.
The result is an average climate temperature that is surprisingly a few degrees colder than the Earth is today.
The model shows the history of Venus, similar to the evolution that previously was suggested by planetary scientists.
Although Venus may have once been inhabited, it has been exposed to excessive heat and ultraviolet radiation for several billion years.
Her oceans evaporated and her water vapor was burned by ultraviolet radiation.
When its hydrogen flew away, all that was left was a dense atmosphere of carbon dioxide with a deadly greenhouse effect -- that is, Venus as we know it today.
The researchers shared the results of their new Venus climate model in the journal Geophysical Research Letters.
Patrick Roy is leaving his Avalanche coaching job.
Patrick Roy left the coaching position and vice president of hockey operations for the Colorado Avalanche on Thursday, citing a lack of influence during the team's decision-making process.
Colorado's executive vice president/chief operating officer Joe Sakik confirmed the news and noted that the club will begin looking for a new coach immediately.
"For the past three years, I have served as the head coach and vice president of hockey operations for the Colorado Avalanche with energy, passion and determination", Roy, 50, said in a statement.
I spent the summer thinking long and hard about how I could improve this team, give it the depth it needed and take it to a higher level.
To achieve this goal, the vision of the coach and vice president of hockey activities must match the vision of the organization.
He must also have the right to vote when making decisions that affect the team's work.
These conditions are not met at this time.
Sakik, who hired Roy on May 23, 2013, thanked Roy for his contribution to the team.
"Patrick told me about his decision today", said Sakik.
We appreciate everything he's done for our organization, and we wish him success in the future.
Roy won the Jack Adams Award as the league's top coach during his first season with the Avalanche in 2013-14.
He led the club to 112 points and a Central Division victory, but Colorado was defeated by Minnesota in the first round of the playoffs and missed the playoffs the past two years.
The Avalanche posted a 39-39-4 mark in the 2015-2016 season and were five points behind the Wild in their bid for a second Western Conference berth.
Hall of Fame goalie Roy won four Stanley Cups  two against the Montreal Canadiens and the Avalanche.
North Sea oil workers resume negotiations and suspend strike
Workers' strikes on the North Sea oil workers' salaries have been suspended, and all sides are entering a new round of negotiations, the leaders of the parties said.
Strikes against the Wood Group oil company were sporadically organized on platforms in the North Sea, owned by Royal Dutch Shell.
"Wood Group and the Unite and RMT alliances can confirm that we have agreed to resume the negotiation process to resolve the ongoing disputes", the joint statement said.
We're going to have a few full-day meetings over the next few weeks, starting next week, to take a fresh look at the issues.
Trade unions said their recent campaign, which they said was the first in more than 25 years, was aimed at potential wage cuts of up to 30 percent.
Wood Group has cut rates for contract staff working in the North Sea this year by about 9 percent due to negative market tensions.
The company's rate cut came after a 10 percent reduction in rates for contract workers working on shore in 2014.
The company says the additional cuts will give it the space it needs to overcome the market downturn.
Shell, for its part, has cut thousands of jobs and announced plans to cut oil and gas operations in 10 countries as it streamlines its operations following its mega merger with British energy company BG Group.
Energy companies are under pressure from falling crude oil prices: the economic situation has worsened as a result of the decision to leave the European Union, which the UK took in June.
Scottish MP Dave Anderson met with union leaders earlier this week to discuss one of the largest labour conflicts in the North Sea in our era.
The North Sea, he said, is vital to the regional economy.
"In the North Sea, and across the country, we need an economy that works for the majority, not just a few", he said in a statement.
Less than $1.4 billion is expected to be spent on new projects in the North Sea in 2016, in contrast to an average of about $7 billion over the past five years.
Kepler is measuring the speed of the stars in the Pleiades cluster.
The Kepler space telescope's latest mission helped astronomers compile the most complete catalog of the rotational speeds of the stars in the Pleiades cluster.
New data helps astronomers understand why stars in a cluster rotate at different speeds and how periods of rotation relate to planet formation.
"We hope that by comparing our results with other star clusters, we can learn more about the relationship between the mass of the star, its age, and even the history of its solar system", said Louise Riball, a research associate at the California Institute of Technology's Center for Infrared Processing and Analysis.
The Pleiad cluster is 445 light-years from Earth.
Many of the stars in the cluster are only now reaching maturity; they were born about 125 million years ago.
They're spinning faster than they ever will.
At their peak speeds, these mature stars emit large amounts of stellar wind.
Traveling through the magnetic fields of stars, these winds have a disruptive effect on the stars.
As the star ages, its rotation rate begins to slow.
Kepler measures the rate of rotation of each star by tracking the time between the appearance of recognizable star spots such as sunspots.
The latest catalog of rotational speeds suggests that more massive stars orbit more slowly than less massive stars.
Fishall compares stars to dancers: the larger ones make the pyroets slower than the smaller ones.
In the Pleiades Ballet, we observe that those that rotate slowly are usually more massive, whereas those that rotate faster are usually very light stars", said Riball.
Because the Pleiades cluster is so close, it serves as the perfect space laboratory for matching the properties of stars with their rotational speeds.
"The Pleiades star cluster provides a starting point for theoretical models of the rotation of stars, both young and old", said Ryball.
We still want to know more about how, where, and why stars slow down their rotation and hang their "dance shoes" on the nail, figuratively speaking.
Riball and her colleagues have detailed their latest analysis of Pleiades rotation speeds in three new articles that will soon be published in the Astronomical Journal.
Investigation related to the activities of a group of Ukrainian divers detained in Crimea is being conducted by two departments, writes "Kommersant".
The FSB is collecting evidence of involvement of detainees in preparing the divisions in Crimea.
As previously reported, the statement of appreciation was given by the resident of the Ukrainian city of Energodar, Evgeny Panov, who agreed to cooperate with the investigation.
According to him, as a diversion facility, he considered the Titan chemical plant in Armenia, the oil base in Feodosia, the Kerch ferry crossing, the gas pipeline, as well as one of the military airfields.
Law enforcement officials say they're not able to arrest all the diversionists.
This, in particular, became the basis for the arrest of suspects in the Kyiv district court of Simferopol, the publication notes.
Stanislav Cherchesov became the head coach of the Russian national football team
At the meeting of the executive committee of the Russian football union, a decision was made to appoint Stanislav Cherchesov as head coach of the Russian national football team.
The contract with him will be for two years - until the end of the 2018 World Cup.
On August 11, the executive of the Russian Federation appointed Stanislav Cherchesov as head coach of the Russian national football team.
He is a well-known footballer who previously played for Moscow's Spartak as a goalkeeper, as well as a solid coach with experience, who was a mentor to such Russian teams as Spartak, Gemjujina-Sochy, Terek, Amkar, Dynamo, and Warsaw's Ligue, which won the national championship and the country's cup.
The contract with Chertchev will be signed soon and is expected to last two years.
Thus, it is his responsibility to prepare the national team for the 2018 World Cup.
It is known that his coaching staff will include Miroslav Romashchenko, Gintaras Stauche, Vladimir Panikov.
There's information that the salary of the entire coaching staff will be 2.6 billion euros a year.
According to the media, the leadership of the Russian Federation set the goal of bringing Russia's national team to the semi-finals and winning medals.
As the coach himself has stated, as a priority task he considers creating a competitive environment in the team and is going to give the players an opportunity to show themselves.
Also, according to Cherchesov, he's glad the choice fell on him.
The first match under the leadership of Cherchesov will be held on August 31 in Antalya - it will be a friendly match with the Turkish team.
Recall, earlier the post of head coach of the Russian national football team was held by Leonid Slutsky, who combined him with coaching in the club of the CSKA.
He announced his resignation after the Russian national team's failed performance at Euro 2016 in France.
He took responsibility for the team's poor result.
Crammed between Angola and South Africa, Namibia suffered greatly during the long struggle against apartheid.
Nevertheless, since gaining independence from South Africa in 1990, the country of 2.4 million people has made tremendous progress, especially in the last few years.
The main reason for Namibia's success is that the government is paying great attention to education.
While people in developed countries take free primary and secondary education for granted, in many poor countries, secondary and even primary schools require tuition fees.
Moreover, governments are often advised to introduce a fee to "reimburse costs".
However, in Namibia, primary education is free.
Moreover, since 2015, secondary education has been free.
The country's authorities are also working actively in other important areas.
Efforts to eradicate malaria have reduced the number of annual cases of the disease by 97% over the past ten years.
Contrary to the growing international trend, inequality is declining in Namibia.
Compared with 1993, the Gini coefficient, which is the standard indicator of income inequality, dropped by 15 points.
Then, 23 years ago, that was one of the highest rates in the world.
And the poverty rate has dropped from 69 percent in 1993 to less than 30 percent.
The number of people living in extreme poverty (less than $1.90 a day) also fell, from almost 53 percent to less than 23 percent.
Namibia also has the highest free speech rating in Africa, according to Reporters Without Borders.
The country has far outstripped the United States and other rich nations.
In addition, the country has a favorable rating - one of the highest in Africa - in the "Corruption Perception Index", compiled by human rights defenders from Transparency International.
Even now, with commodity prices falling, Namibia is able to maintain a high growth rate.
At the same time, the debt-to-GDP ratio is about 25%, which is less than 1/3 of the debt level in the US and most European countries.
Of course, Namibia has some problems.
The unemployment rate, at least by traditional estimates, remains fairly high - almost 28%.
And like other countries in the region, Namibia has a high rate of HIV/AIDS infection - almost 17% of the population is infected.
The World Bank estimates that Namibia is among the countries with higher-than-average incomes, but the authorities insist that their country is actually a developing country.
Namibia certainly faces some of the challenges that are inherent in the underdeveloped economies.
The state has to develop a very large and arid country with a small population.
The country's desert is home to isolated nomadic hunter-gatherer tribes who must be integrated into modern society without losing their identity.
Integrating people who lived on the periphery of the global economy a quarter of a century ago is not an easy task for any country.
Namibia is even more challenged: like any other country in the world, it faces the effects of climate change.
Namibia has not given up on its challenges.
Almost immediately after independence, the authorities began to create a diversified economy and a cohesive society.
It is noteworthy that competing political factions have come together to work for the common good.
Indeed, Namibia provides affordable health care not only to its own citizens but also to its neighbors.
About 15-20% of visitors to medical facilities in northern areas of Namibia are Angolan citizens.
Nobody in Namibia is talking about building a wall that would separate the country from its poor and corrupt neighbors.
Namibis understood that neighbors were not elected, so they decided not to conflict with them, but to cooperate - share scarce water resources, participate in regional health projects, encourage investment and exchange of students.
Moreover, the Namibian government has rightly reasoned that rich natural resources can easily become a curse, contributing to the enrichment of the few at the expense of the many.
The authorities understand that the revenues from Namibia's natural resources must be invested in infrastructure and production capacity.
They also realize that it would be irresponsible not to seek to maximize profits from the sale of the country's resources, and they are reviewing investment laws and mining contracts to make sure that this is the case.
Transparency is crucial to this process, which is why strong government support for free speech is so important.
As the head of state, Hague Geingob, noted, the media often say things that he does not like.
But after fighting for freedom from apartheid in South Africa, Namibia must defend the freedoms it has gained, the president says.
Not all of Namibia's key resources are exhaustive.
Some, like fishing, are renewable, and the government is doing everything it can to preserve and strengthen them.
Every year, more than a million foreign tourists visit the country.
Namibia shows that even those countries that start with serious shortcomings - racism, colonialism, inequality, and low development - can be on the path to common prosperity.
Her achievements deserve international recognition and emulation.
Many have heard of the "Golden Varna" - the earliest gold objects made by man (4600-4200 B.C.E.).
Perhaps the biggest archaeological sensation of the 1970s was the excavation of the Varnese Necropolis in Bulgaria, which discovered a fantastic number of gold artifacts - over 3,000, weighing in at 6 kilograms.
Only from one burial site known as "Tomb No. 43" were extracted 990 gold objects weighing more than 1.5 kg.
However, the official status of the world's oldest gold may soon be changed to the unspotted bronze that archaeologists found in July of this year.
And again in Bulgaria - in a prehistoric settlement known as Tell Yunatsi.
Unlike Varna, a port city, Tell Yunatsi is located far from the sea, near the village of Yunatsi in the Pazarjik district.
The busin is a gold band wrapped in a ring.
Yavor Boajjiyev, the head of excavations at Tella Yunatsite, dated the find to 4600 BC and stated that it was at least 200 years older than the gold of Varna.
The treasures of Varna, we recall, date from about the same period, 4600-4200 BC.
There is currently no technology to date metals with perfect accuracy.
How can we be sure which gold is older?
Professor Boajiev obviously knows more than he told Reuters: "I'm absolutely certain that the gold of the Yunatsite is older than the gold of Varna".
It's a very important finding: it's a small object in appearance, but it's big enough to fit in with history.
In an interview with Reuters, Boajjiev said that in the near future, scientists will analyze the composition of the metal, as well as re-examine and more carefully the archaeological layer where the gold artifact was found.
It'll help date the grain with the greatest possible accuracy.
The location of the find also explains a lot.
Tell Junatsi is a famous settlement, even if you've never heard of it.
Today, Telle Junatsi is considered the oldest city in Europe.
Tel was founded by descendants of people who migrated to Europe from Anatolia (modern Turkey) in the 7th millennium BC.
During the following centuries, the processing of metals in this region developed rapidly, from the first metallurgical skills to the creation of a full-fledged industry.
In the national historiography, this archaeological community has a special name: Balkan-Carpathian metallurgical province.
In the 5th millennium BC, urban settlements began to emerge around metalworking centers.
They are now called the oldest cities in Europe.
Of these, Tell Yunatset is perhaps the oldest, as artifacts dating back to 4900 BC have been found here.
I would call Tell Junatsi a prototype of a modern city, although it's a very ancient settlement, even compared to Mesopotamia.
"This place is a thousand years older than Sumer", says Boajjiev, referring to the commonly held view that urban culture originated in southern Mesopotamia, modern-day Iraq.
It was there that the first cities in the usual sense of the word were born.
Excavations of the Telle of Yunatsite have been carried out since 1976.
During this time, archaeologists have excavated nearly 12 hectares, about a third of the estimated total area of the settlement.
The remains of the fortress wall were found, which once reached a height of three meters.
Little remains of houses and workshops, but archaeologists clearly distinguish between streets, public buildings, urban density, "business center" and residential outskirts.
Tell Junatsi is often referred to as the "Birding City": dozens of clay bird figures have been found here.
All birds are depicted in a state of stillness, hence the suggestion that they were not decorative objects, but objects of local worship.
The "Birding City" was destroyed about 4100 B.C.E. - possibly by Indo-European tribes from the northeast.
The nomads had no cities, but horses and weapons.
The three-meter-high fortifications did not stop them.
Archaeologists have found clear signs of brutal slaughter: Inside the houses, the remains of old men, women, and children were found with traces of wounds inflicted by warheads.
New discoveries and facts are emerging each year, changing the familiar perceptions of ancient human history.
Bulgarian archaeologists are increasingly talking not about individual cultures, but about the "lost" first civilization of Europe, which originated in the Balkans.
A powerful incentive to seek this civilization was the "Gold of Varna", found relatively recently, in 1972.
It's logical that Varna's golden luxury must have preceded something - something like the tiny gold beans created in Tella Yunati.
Porsche has artificially aged the 911 Targa.
It is officially announced that the 911 Targa 4S Exclusive Design is being hand-trained by the specialists of the unit who work with the production machines.
The retro look is, for example, a special color of the Etna Blue body, which was designed in 1960 for the Porsche 356B - even the model logo is painted in this color.
In addition, the bargain received a brand-new white graphic along the board and special 20-inch RS Spyder wheel discs, as well as some body design details painted in "white-gold metallic".
The interior of the retro-snaps is noticeably smaller: it is, by a large margin, gray-blue in color, with new chairs with expanded electrical regulatory ranges and black anodized steel thresholds with the logo of the unit.
In addition, each buyer will receive a special version of the car as a gift and a richly decorated album with photos of the production process.
The power plant was not touched by the Porsche Exclusive specialists: the retro-target matches the production one in terms of characteristics.
It is equipped with a turbocharged 3.0-liter six-cylinder engine, developing 420 hp and 500 Nm.
The most dynamic version of the 911 Targa 4S is capable of speeding up to 100 km/h in 4 seconds.
The Porsche 911 Targa 4S Exclusive Design will be released in limited numbers, but neither its volume nor the cost of each particular sports car is disclosed.
Facebook and ad blockers have unleashed an arms race
Facebook's recent introduction of technology to prevent ads from being hidden on social media pages has prompted developers to block ads in response.
AdBlock Plus has released anti-venom, but Facebook plans to make it useless soon.
So AdBlock Plus has announced its new technology, which is likely to remain effective for a short time.
Social media officials said that in an effort to trick the new technology of "unblocked" advertising, AdBlock Plus's solution, along with commercial ads, blocks many regular posts from friends or pages.
Facebook has expressed regret over the AdBlock Plus policy and promised to resolve the issue soon.
According to a source among the developers of the social networking site TechCrunch, the code that makes AdBlock Plus useless on the Facebook desktop site will be ready in the next few hours.
So the social network and the blockers started a kind of arms race to beat each other, and the affected side were users who missed interesting posts from friends or saw ads where they weren't used to seeing them.
The ethical aspects of advertising blocking have been hotly debated lately.
In Murmansk, the rapist will appear before the court.
His case has already been investigated by the Investigative Committee of the Russian Federation for the Murmansk region.
The 54-year-old man is charged with a serious sexual assault.
The investigation found that in late November 2015, the accused in the Pavlov street area of Murmansk committed sexual acts with violence against a 20-year-old girl.
The sanction of this article provides for a maximum sentence of imprisonment for a term not exceeding six years.
Dongfeng is bringing to Russia the cross-swans Fengguang 370 and pickup Rich New - website Driving www.zr.ru
Dongfeng Fengguang 370 is a popular car class in China that combines the advantages of a minivan and a crossover.
Another announced Russian premiere is the Rich New pickup.
Many Western firms have decided to ignore the Moscow International Motor Show this year, so the exhibition halls of the Crocus Expo will be filled by Chinese firms.
In particular, the powerful front will be Dongfeng Motor Corporation, which has a great view of the Russian market and intends to offer a number of interesting new products to our car enthusiasts in the near future.
One of them will be the Dongfeng Fengguang 370 crosswheel , which went on sale in China this spring at a price of 55 900 yuan (just under 550 thousand rubles at the current price).
The Russians are unlikely to see such a value, and the issue of supplies to our country is still under discussion.
In China, by the way, the Fengguang 370 managed to reach the 11th place in the list of best-selling minivans in June sales, although due to its high road clearance (175 mm) and protective plastic overhang on the lower body perimeter, it can be classified as a crossover.
The crosswheel is built on the front-wheel drive platform of the smaller model Fengguang 360, with the same wheelbase as the 370th, 2725 mm, but the body is slightly longer (4565 mm vs. 4510 mm), the design is more solid, and the equipment is richer.
The salon is decorated with wooden planks, but the large vertical touchscreen "like Tesla" on the central console was only on the early exhibition examples of the cross-vehicle, and cars with "music" came to market simpler.
Five of the seven seating places are easily folded, forming a flat loading platform with a length of 1650 mm, maximum luggage volume - 1500 l.
The engine for the Fengguang 370 is only one - a 1.5-liter petrol "atmospheric" with 115 hp, fitted with a 5-speed mechanical transmission.
The manufacturer is modestly silent about the dynamic qualities of the car, but promises a sparing budget of 6.7 liters per 100 km.
The Rich New pickup is a well-known Russian Nissan NP300 Navara of the past generation, but with a slightly enhanced design by Chinese stylists.
Despite its morally outdated design, this model is still in steady demand among Chinese consumers as a reliable and unpretentious "working horse".
At a similar price, Rich New will surely interest Russians, because modern Japanese pickup trucks have become overly expensive.
Rich New is equipped with two engines to choose from: a 2.4 litre petrol engine (137 hp) or a 2.5 litre turbo diesel engine (116 hp).
The transmission is mechanical, the drive is on the rear wheels, but there are modifications and a tight front.
The new flagship sedan A9 will be on the Dongfeng stand, and its Russian premiere was announced by the Chinese company's representative in June.
Minwen-like crossovers are increasingly available in the Chinese market, with the latest innovations being the Cowin V3 and SWM X7.
Currently, the Russian Dongfeng lineup consists of two models: the S30 sedan and the H30 Cross hatchback.
In the seven months of this year, the dealers of the Chinese company sold 696 cars in our country.
No more reports on transportation tax will be sent by post - website Driving www.zr.ru
The IRS has changed the way property taxes are notified.
All Russian car owners are used to the same scheme: in summer and autumn they receive a receipt for the transport tax payment for the previous year.
But this year, many are not looking forward to it.
The fact is, the IRS has changed the procedure for notifying citizens without much noise.
Those registered in the "Personal Taxpayer's Office" on the official website of the agency nalog.ru will receive notifications in electronic form.
The inspection automatically counted such Russians as online users and removed them from the standard, "paper" mail.
The new policy will affect all owners of vehicles and real estate.
Everyone else will still get the usual mail.
However, the website also allows account holders to return to the old scheme.
To do this, they will have to go to the tax office in August and submit an application.
On the one hand, the new order is more modern and convenient.
The notice will appear in the "personal office" immediately after the letter is written, whereas the letter will last for several days and may be lost altogether.
In addition, the number of users of the tax inspection's internet service has exceeded 18 million, which will allow the agency to save significantly on mail.
On the other hand, the modest news on the inspection website is clearly not enough to inform citizens of the change in order.
Some might have registered for a one-time service in a "personal office" and forgotten about it.
These people will not wait for the mail and, without knowing it, will be classified as nonpayers with all the consequences.
Access to the "Personal Taxpayer's Cabinet" is made by three means: through the account of gosuslugi.ru, by electronic signature or by entering the login and password specified in the registration card.
The latter can be obtained personally in any tax inspection office (regardless of the place of registration).
We remind you that this year the transport tax must be paid by December 1.
The notification began in July.
The Mercedes-Benz G-Class tuning, which is designed to deliver very high performance, is a thing in itself.
But the controversial concept did not embarrass the G-Power masters who took on the task of modifying the Mercedes-AMG G 63 sports version.
G-Power is known for its addiction to BMW cars, but nothing human is foreign to its masters.
Really, why not upgrade the G 63-571s to a flying stern with tank aerodynamics and a thrust of up to 100 in 5.4 seconds?
By pressing the "muscles" of a crazy "helix", the masters took advantage of the advantages of a 5.5-liter superfluous "eight".
Now the dynamics of the split to hundreds have improved by an unmistakable 0.1 seconds, and now the flying brick can take 5.3 seconds to lift.
However, medium-speed acceleration is probably a lot better.
The speed limit is scary: if the standard G 63 doesn't go faster than 210 km/h, a tuning all-wheel drive with a deactivated electronic "necklace" can squeeze 250 km/h.
The car is virtually identical to its factory origin outside, except for the other 23-inch Hurricane RR wheel discs, 305/35 ZR 23.
Mercedes-Maybach's luxury division has announced a stunning 6m concept coupe that will be presented at the Pebble Beach Concours d'Elegance.
Mercedes-Benz is set to compete with the "green subbrand" BMW i and will promote its electric models under a separate trademark.
At least four environmental innovations are expected in the coming years.
