The rookie helped Trabzonspor to second place, and Skoda also hit
Defender Filip Novák helped the club win the vice-master title in the last round of the Turkish football league Trabzonspor.
His team won 2-1 at Kayserispor and kept the third Besiktas in a row.
The striker of Milan Škoda scored his tenth goal for Rizespor after the January transfer from Slavia, which was saved, although he lost 1:3 at the field of Fenerbahce.
The rookie confirmed the defender's excellent productivity with his seventh goal of the season.
In the 63rd minute, Kayserispor's goalkeeper just fired a sharp shot and the Czech footballer from the corner hit the ball into the net.
The home side managed to tie five minutes before the end, but Trabzonspor in the sixth minute of the setup snatched the victory to their side when they successfully completed the break four to one.
The damage at the start of the second half of the match against Fenerbahce equalized after the solo to 1-1.
The Risespor did not hold the tie for long, but it did not hurt him, because the results of the opponents left him three points above the relegation zone.
The competition will end with the Sunday duel of the champion Basaksehir at Kasimpasa Field.
The well-concealed hermit's cave in the woods near Nový Bór was not actually habitable.
In the north of Bohemia, in the foothills of the Lužice Mountains, near Nový Bór, Českolipsko, several sandstone rock formations are hidden in the forests that led to the Count's Way.
Natural and man-made.
And we're going after the man-made thing.
It's called the hermit's cave.
But in fact, no hermit ever lived here, and the cave served as a hiding place, more precisely a hiding chamber, probably for grain.
The cave is carved from the side into a rock keep and is accessible by stairs from above.
But you can't see it until the last minute.
It is revealed by the narrow staircase leading to a sort of rock gallery, from which one enters the rock.
Although the chamber appears to be far from human habitation, at the time of its formation it may have been on the upper plateau where the forest is now, a field.
"The fact that the building has no window and that there is no boiler room in the traditional place clearly proves that no hermit could have survived the winter here", explains historian Kamil Podroužek of the Faculty of Philosophy of Jan Evangelista Purkyně in Ústí nad Labem.
The single-room building has only a stone bench at the back, apparently for storing dishes.
"I see it as a chamber for storing some food or products from the field", adds Kamil Podroužek.
There are obvious traces of tools on the cave walls.
Breaking a sandstone with a pointed hammer was fairly simple and quick for the initiates.
All you had to do was use the appropriate couplers and break the sandbox apart.
The length of the trail along the tip and the cutting method in general provide a framework for determining the period of the cave's formation.
According to the historian, it is probably the end of the 18th century.
The cave is open to the public, and the mess it creates means that people sometimes sleep there nowadays.
If you approach the cave from above from one of the forest roads and are taken by the underlying stream and the nearby count's path, you will surely find a path down as well.
And on the way out of the woods, you might be enchanted by the nearby Raven Rock.
Jockey Minarik is in a coma after a severe fall in Germany
"Philip is in the best of hands now.
The institute is set up for such cases, and fortunately we have a family in Hanover.
This greatly eases my situation and also the care of my daughter Finja", Minařík's wife Katja said.
"Everyone is doing their best, Philip needs time to recover now.
There's no point in making any predictions.
Anyone who's ever encountered the problem of head trauma and patients in artificial sleep knows that the situation can change.
Philip is a great warrior.
We all have to be patient and give him time", said the wife of the 45-year-old jockey.
Financial support for the injured Minarik was also urged on Twitter by star Frankie Dettori, who won the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes at Ascot on Saturday, equalling the legend of Lester Piggott.
Almost 70,000 euros have been raised on Gofundme to date.
The target is €100,000.
The video referee took Sassuolo's players four goals, they lost 0-2.
Sassuolo's players got the ball into the opponent's goal four times in Saturday's match in Naples, but in the end they had to settle for a 0-2 defeat.
None of their goals were conceded by the referee after a video consultation for offside.
According to Italian media, this is a record-breaking technological disadvantage, the most VAR has ever lost to a single team.
"VAR was tougher on Sassuolo than road radar and punished him like no other team.
New technology is breaking records", wrote the newspaper Gazzetta dello Sport in a commentary.
"Sasuol's unrecognized goals festival.
Never before has the VAR been so strict on one team", added the Corriere dello Sport.
Napoli took the lead on Saturday in the eighth minute, but after half an hour of play, Sassuolo seemed to be in the lead.
Philip Djuričić's goal was not recognised after the video referee's intervention due to offside.
For the same reason, the next strikes by Djuricic and the hits by Francesco Caputo and Domenica Berardi did not pay off.
The home side, on the other hand, scored another goal.
Electric cars are setting a new record.
The Czech Republic has the highest number of coal mines in history.
"The growth was driven by both the 30% increase in the number of stations in our network and the trend of more frequent charging at public stations, as well as the accelerated development of new e-car registrations", said Tomáš Chmelík, head of the clean technologies department at CEZ.
Other major players are also claiming market shares, such as PRE and E.ON, the electric car manufacturer Tesla, but also perhaps the supermarkets Bill and Lidl.
The operator of the conventional petrol stations is represented by MOL.
She doesn't have a number yet.
"We started building our electric mobility network only last year", explained company spokeswoman Jana Jusková.
However, the editors of the Diary obtained exclusively data from all 216 electrical stands operated by ČEZ.
It follows that drivers at stations took on average 13,5 kWh.
That's equivalent to a range of about 100 kilometers for a smaller electric car.
If you leave out the tiny pumping of 1 kWh, the average charge takes two and a half hours.
The vast majority of refuelling was then done at a free rate.
If motorists had already paid for the subscription, their typical expense was around CZK 330.
Electric mobility is mainly in the capital.
Prague is home to all five of the most popular ČEZ chargers, which are also popular in the surrounding cities.
Olomouc then leads the regions.
On the other hand, the least interested are the remote border stations, such as Bohumína or Prachatice, which often remain unused throughout the day.
More than four thousand electric vehicles are currently registered in the Czech Republic.
In the first six months of this year alone, 1,274 new e-cars were added.
In a large-scale poll conducted by the Czech Moving Press, eight percent of readers said they were considering buying an electric car for their family.
However, only one third of respondents know where to find the nearest charging station in their area.
Not just for better water retention.
In Prague, environmental activists protested
According to the organizers, the government's actions so far in the issues of protection and restoration of the Czech landscape and the solution of the climate crisis are insufficient, and the speakers called on the state to take a more aggressive approach.
The event, called Last Drop, was attended by representatives of large organisations such as the Rainbow Movement, Greenpeace or the Green Party, as well as smaller local associations.
"We have people here who have been protesting against the expansion of the Turów mine for a long time, there are people here who are protesting against the sandstone mining at Uhersky Ostroh, there are people here who are protesting against the construction of senseless dams", said Marika Volfová, the organizer.
She said the main demands of the protesters were to create a plan to retain water in the landscape, to radically change agricultural policy and the subsidy system to promote sustainable agriculture and to move from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources as quickly as possible.
"Government is supposed to protect the interests of the people, not the ruthless and devastating business", she said.
A booth was placed on Malostranský náměstí with a petition calling on Czech state officials to take action on reducing greenhouse gas emissions and restoring Czech land and landscape.
The people present were equipped with banners with slogans such as "End of the beet-pick" or "Less coal, more pickles".
Jan Škoda from the association Za vodu za ludzi, which protests against the plan to extract gravel in Hodonínsk, came to Prague from southern Moravia.
"It threatens the drinking water supply of 140,000 people", he said.
He added that wells represent the fifth most productive source of drinking water in the Czech Republic.
The planned sand gravel extraction is located only about 500 metres from the wells and it is estimated that the water quality will be compromised.
Vojtěch Veselý came from the village of Valeč in Karlovy Vary to become a so-called agroecological farmer.
He warned of the clusters of small farms that do not live on income and profit and supply the population on the spot.
"Small agroecological farms are able to feed the whole population in a completely normal way, while not causing such damage to the countryside and the environment", he said.
Three people died when a plane crashed into a house in Germany
Three people were killed and two others injured today when an ultralight plane crashed into a residential building in western Germany.
They informed the local emergency services that the dead were probably two crew members and one resident of the house.
The plane crashed on the roof of a building in Wesel, North Rhine-Westphalia.
The loft, one of five units in the house, subsequently caught fire.
Firefighters have already managed to bring the flames under control.
Deputy Fire Chief Robert Meyboom said both crew members of the plane were killed.
The third victim is a woman who lived in the house, according to police.
The Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung (WAZ), citing the mayor, Wessel, reported that the mother was a single mother whose two-year-old daughter was rescued from her apartment with minor injuries.
An emergency parachute was found near the crash site, apparently used as a landing brake.
Police are assuming it came from a crashed plane.
There was room for two on the plane.
The plane took off from the airport in the nearby town of Marl.
The Rheinische Post newspaper, citing eyewitnesses, reported that the plane had collided with a hot-air balloon before crashing.
However, this information has not been confirmed so far.
WAZ, citing other witnesses, said the plane broke apart in mid-air before hitting the ground.
The Czech savings bank charged some payments on the card twice on Saturday.
The error has been corrected
A Czech savings bank charged its customers twice on Saturday afternoon for some card payments.
According to bank spokesman Lukáš Kropík, the problem could have involved thousands of transactions.
The savings bank has already corrected the mistake and returned the money to the clients.
Problems with double-dealing card payments were reported by the savings bank on Saturday afternoon.
"Yesterday night we updated the system and all these double payments were immediately returned to the clients.
At the moment everything is working without problems", Kropík said on Sunday afternoon.
The exact number of clients to whom the bank deducted money from card payments twice is not known by the bank's spokesman, but he estimates that it was less than a thousand transactions.
The savings bank is investigating the cause of the problems.
"It could be a combination of factors", said Drip.
The Czech Savings Bank is the largest bank in the Czech Republic by number of clients.
By the end of March, it had 4.6 million.
The savings bank is owned by the Austrian financial group Erste Group Bank, which is a key player in the banking market in Central and Eastern Europe.
Vojtěch on Monday will introduce a three-tiered system of emergency response to the coronavirus
"The grades will be based on the strength of the community spread at the regional level.
We are working on this together with epidemiologists and the Institute of Health Information and Statistics", said Vojtěch in the Czech Republic.
It will be a so-called traffic light, with regions marked in green, orange or red depending on the risk of coronavirus.
The minister added that he would still talk to epidemiologists about the inclusion of individual regions.
He admitted that only Moravian-Silesian Region would have orange color at present and Prague would be close to it.
The map will also show individual measures for regional sanitation stations, hospitals, social facilities and employers.
"We want to address this at the regional level, because the situation is not uniform", said Vojtěch.
The Waterman and Caroline
When the plumber Jonah and the miller's daughter Caroline fall in love, it's not easy.
Jonas is defended in love by his father, the rude waterman Hastrbuch, while Caroline has no idea that her dear Jonas is not human.
Fortunately, there is a young Libor who will do anything to protect the whole village, especially Caroline, from the evil of the water chief.
What's the difference between lying and scheming?
Especially if he can get Caroline to reject Jonas and prefer him, the brave Libor.
Soon it is clear to everyone in the village who is responsible for the drowning of the night pot, the spoiled flour, the mill fire and other trash.
The villagers are furious and go after the well, and Jonah is cursed with an unforgivable water curse.
Now, the little soul of Konvichek, Caroline, give me your advice.
How do you soften old Hastrub, convince the neighbors of Jonah's innocence, find Jonah and free him from the curse?
The fairy tale was filmed in September 2010 in the Czech Republic studios and in the exterior of the Brzina pond, in Obděnice on Sedlčansko and in the beautiful environment of the historic mill in Hoslovic.
The new e-shop is launched at the mostte motorway
The customers of the Brest motor racing circuit can use the new e-shop on its website.
It also offers coupons for free and test rides by car or motorcycle on a large race track, which was previously only possible in person from the racecourse staff in the starting tower.
"We have taken steps to improve the e-shop to make it user-friendly, while also expanding the portfolio of products and services that can be purchased through it.
At the same time, we have prepared a bonus for our customers in the form of a discount of 1000 CZK on all safe driving courses on offer.
The discount coupon can be found on the website www.autodrom-most.cz", explained Jana Svobodová, Sales and Marketing Director of AUTODROM MOST.
The website of the e-shop is now clear, easy for the customer to navigate.
"The visitor to the e-shop selects the focus on which he is aiming on the dashboard.
For example, sports, safe or sporty driving courses, training, experience programmes, gift items, gift vouchers, activities for children and more", she said.
The products and services offered by the e-shop include, for example, the Racing Legends surprise shirt, the motorway, the low visibility safe driving course, advertising and gift items from the Buggyra Racing team, or the Engelmuller glove from the limited edition of the BOHEMATIC watchmaker, created to celebrate the historic victory at the prestigious 24 Hours of Le Mans in 1949.
"The offer is very varied, the customer can choose from more than 200 items", specified Jana Svobodová.
When paying for a product or service selected, the customer may choose one of four options.
Payment by deposit (bank transfer), by deposit, cash on personal delivery or online via the payment gateway.
The course of most cases is mild, with only three percent of those infected needing to be hospitalized.
Either the Czech Republic is spreading a milder form of the coronavirus, or the summer sunshine has significantly improved our immunity.
Hospital infection wards are half empty, even as the numbers of infected people are rising.
"The situation today and in April is completely different, and this is mainly due to the number of hospitalizations", confirms Health Minister Adam Vojtěch.
It's worth remembering that on April 11, when the first wave of the epidemic peaked, everyone wore robes, the army collected, the republic was closed, and the Czechs were using disinfectant for the year ahead.
Yet ten people were dying every day.
Now the daily increases in the number of infected are higher, but every day with COVID-19 a maximum of two people die.
Karvinsk still has the highest number of infected per capita, and Jihlava has similar numbers due to an outbreak at the local Alzheimer's Center, where there are already 57 infected - 40 clients and 17 employees.
Another nursing home has closed down in Chernožice on Královéhradec.
The disease was confirmed by tests from one of the nurses.
"We are shaking, we are restricting movement, we have all the hygiene measures", says the director of the nursing home, Martin Schächel.
He says none of the clients at the home have shown symptoms of the disease.
They'll start field testing the hygiene tomorrow and then decide on the next course of action.
Hospitals are responding to the increased number of cases.
The Brno Cancer Institute today launched an automatic camera system at the entrance that detects whether people are wearing a robe when they enter.
The record is reported by South Bohemian hygienists, who have recorded 25 cases of coronavirus - most of them foreign employees of a cash-crunching company.
A total of 131 cases were reported on Saturday - half the number on Friday - but fewer tests were carried out over the weekend.
The debutant champion!
Van den Bergh wrote the fairy tale, Anderson was wiped out.
The big surprise of the tournament named Dimitri van den Bergh has shown an excellent performance even in the fight against the player who won the second most prestigious enterprise within the PDC in 2018.
The start of the match was a two-way tie, the break came at 8:7 for the Belgian archer.
Van den Bergh took the 13-arrow leg and has been in the lead ever since.
He literally crushed his opponent with his play, and the much more experienced "Flying Scot" had a hard time getting to double digits.
The way the Dream Maker had him in his grasp was also shown by the fact that the dismissed Anderson played his first full game in the 24th inning.
Plus, the young Belgian was a great high-paying guy.
Last time he lost in the 11th inning, he was in bad shape but he "catched a big fish" and closed 170.
At the end of the match, Anderson was very frustrated.
He was more of a throwing arrow, and his rival, who was on the run for the victory, was doing absolutely supreme.
Van den Bergh turned the first of three darts matches and got his name - he wrote his big dream.
The prize, named after Phil Taylor, is all the more valuable to the Belgian archer as it's his first major win.
It still holds true that the last player to beat van den Berg was Karel Sedlacek.
In Nantes, charges have been dropped for the cathedral fire, a man confesses
The Cathedral of Saints Peter and Paul in the heart of Nantes caught fire last Saturday, severely damaging the original 16th-century stained glass windows and destroying the organ.
Investigators investigated the suspected arson because the fire proceeded through the temple from three different locations.
Police also found no signs of forced entry at the entrances.
The accused is a volunteer for the local diocese, a 39-year-old Rwandan refugee.
Police arrested him shortly after the fire, but then released him without prosecution.
Now, the prosecution has announced that based on new evidence, the man was arrested again on Saturday, confessed and faces arson charges.
If convicted, he faces up to ten years in prison and a hefty fine.
According to his lawyer, the man regrets his crime and has decided to cooperate fully with the investigators, Le Monde reported.
Vojtěch: On Monday we will present the "seamforth" for epidemiological measures
The new system is intended to serve as a pandemic plan, the absence of which has led to criticism from the government and the Ministry of Health.
"They will be gradually according to the strength of the community spread", the minister explained.
He added that at present, for example, the Moravian-Silesian Region or Prague would reach a medium, orange grade.
The system is designed as regional, as the situation in the regions varies considerably, he added.
The Ministry has worked with epidemiologists and the Institute for Health Information and Statistics (IHIS) on the system.
The Minister said that specific measures will be imposed at the various levels, whether it is the mandatory wearing of veils or the organization of special departments in hospitals.
The creation of an epidemiological plan in the Prima Partie TV programme was called for by Interior Minister Jan Hamáček (ČSSD), according to whom people should have clear information about what measures they can expect if the epidemiological situation worsens.
The daily increase in confirmed cases in the Czech Republic has been increasing in recent days, although the number of hospitalizations remains low.
Vojtěch commented that nothing major is happening, and it's not appropriate to talk about declaring a state of emergency or re-convening the emergency staff.
The government, in view of the growing number of infected since Saturday, has re-established the requirement to wear headscarves at indoor events for more than 100 people.
From Monday, the capacity of these events will be limited to 500 people, now it's 1,000 people.
The government's approach, which until the last minute was unclear as to what measures would be implemented and when they would be announced, has been criticized.
"I think that in a situation that is rather tense, the main actors should create a sense of security and, on the contrary, smooth out the mess", Senator Marek Hilser said in Questions.
The measures may now vary by region, for example in Prague, where the obligation to wear a headscarf is also enforced in non-residential health facilities, such as pharmacies or doctor's offices, from Sunday.
The obligation to wear a headscarf when visiting health and social facilities or pharmacies was introduced from Friday in the Liberec and Ústeck regions.
In the High Plains of Jihlavia, it is mandatory to wear headscarves in indoor public spaces, in the Ministry of Health and in health facilities from 14 July.
In contrast, in the Moravian-Silesian Region, the anti-epidemic measures have been relaxed, as in the Central Bohemian Region of Kutnohorsk.
The Czech government also approved the so-called European traffic light in early June, which colourfully differentiates the level of risk of infection in individual European countries and accordingly adjusts the rules applicable to entry into the Czech Republic from these countries.
In low- and medium-risk countries, authorities will not require a negative coronavirus test from Czech citizens from 15 June or order quarantine instead.
These are mandatory when Czechs return from high-risk countries.
At this point, all EU Member States are now in the low-risk category.
The techno party at Benešovska is continuing.
He's playing at a third capacity, he was supposed to finish at noon.
The Technoparty at the Head of the Lhota (Benešovska) in Benešovsk continues on Sunday evening.
It's still playing a third of the original 12 music systems.
According to the evening police estimates, there are about 500 people left after 8pm, the original rough estimates were 300, the morning was 900, said police spokeswoman Lucie Novak.
Originally, the techno-parties were supposed to end at noon on Sunday, when a portion of the music systems actually went silent.
"Some have already left and others are about to leave.
The music production is still going on in part.
We expect that the music systems will be gradually disconnected and dismantled", Nováková said.
"Police are still rigorously checking out departing visitors to prevent drivers from driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs.
Drivers have the option of undergoing a preventive breathing test before departure,' she added.
Dozens of police officers are monitoring the operation, foreign police, traffic and law enforcement are on the scene, and service dogs are on standby.
"During the day, police checked 470 people moving in the scene and 485 vehicles, 270 drivers were subjected to breath tests, six of them sitting behind the wheel under the influence of alcohol", Nováková said.
A total of 95 drivers were tested for the presence of narcotic and psychotropic substances by police, one of whom tested positive.
The police also handled 14 traffic violations.
At the request of the participants, police conducted 300 preventive breath tests and four preventive tests for the presence of narcotic and psychotropic substances.
There were about 2,000 people at the event Saturday morning.
If the number of participants hadn't decreased, the police would have intervened.
This was stated by the Minister of Interior Jan Hamáček (ČSSD) in the Prima Party TV program.
But the number of participants dropped to less than 1,000, so the police decided that the intervention was not necessary, and neither the sanitation station nor the Ministry of Health requested it.
Czech Television (ČT) reported on Sunday that the technoparty had also spread to surrounding land, whose owners had not agreed to use it for technoparty.
It is possible that the owners of the surrounding land will demand compensation for the damage.
The techno fans at the meadow at the Head of the Time arrived on Friday night.
Police were originally patrolling the pasture in Blazhim on Benešovsk on Friday, where the techno party was held last year.
The blaze is located about 20 miles [30 km] from the head of the Lhoty, where the technicians finally did meet.
According to Novak, no one came to the Blessed.
The little girl ended up in the hospital!
"The first case this year was reported in North Rhine.
The snake bit a girl in the leg, a girl of 2010, whom the parents brought to the rescue service base there", regional spokeswoman of the medical emergency service, Maria Svobodová, told the newspaper, adding that the child was then taken to the hospital in Klatovech.
Snakes are the only venomous snake in the Czech Republic, and they are more common in the Šumava region, so you should be careful when walking.
However, there is no serious danger from these animals.
The chances of being bitten by a snake are not very high, they are afraid of normal contact.
And if she has room for it, she likes to crawl away with a loud sigh.
It will only attack if it feels very threatened - for example, if you accidentally step on it.
Even its bite is not tragic, for its venom is very effective against small mammals, but it does not kill humans.
This can only happen if a person has a particularly weakened organism or suffers from allergies.
Children, the elderly and allergy sufferers are therefore most at risk.
"A person often feels vomit, sweats, has a fever, thirst, stomach pain and diarrhea after being bitten, and in weakened individuals, especially allergy sufferers, anaphylactic shock may occur", described Miriam Greda of Klatovsk Hospital for the daily.
A man threatened to throw the baby out the window.
He drank wine and threw dishes after the policeman
After 11:00 p.m., a task force broke into the apartment and arrested the man.
The babies were immediately taken into care by medical personnel, said regional police spokeswoman Markéta Janovská in a press release.
The man refused to cooperate with the police, throwing dishes, knives, or pouring wine out of the window at the police negotiator.
He reinforced his threats several times during the negotiations by leaning out of the window with the baby in his arms.
One time he even climbed up the window sill himself and frowned.
The police are still investigating the man.
He won't release any more information.
Stosur will prefer her daughter to the tennis season
Australian tennis player Samantha Stosur will not play in the coronavirus-affected season this year.
The 36-year-old 2011 US Open champion, who became a mother in June, doesn't want to end her career yet.
He plans to return to the courts next year, and he believes that thanks to his family and his daughter, he will enjoy tennis even more than before.
Two weeks ago, Stosur announced on social media that her partner, Liz Astling, had given birth to a daughter, Genevieve, in mid-June.
"I'm staying home, spending time with my family, being with all the little milestones our Evie is going to have in the next six months, and just enjoying it", the former world number one in fours told the Australian Federation website.
The WTA Tour will resume its season break from March with a tournament in Palermo on August 3.
Sapa Market: Raids uncover meat, fish and eggs of unknown origin
'One of the vehicles entering the premises was carrying 1,320 quail eggs of unknown origin, in addition to being in unsuitable conditions.
These eggs will also be disposed of in a sanitation facility,' the State Veterinary Administration said.
A check of the live fish stand then revealed that the seller did not have proof of origin and was not registered for the sale of live fish.
The market is considered to be a problematic market from a veterinary point of view for a long time.
For example, last autumn, veterinarians discovered an illegal food store containing nearly half a ton of unmarked food without proof of origin.
For most of them, the date of consumption could not be established, some of the products had expired and were spoiled.
For five kilograms of cuttlefish, the shelf-life was exceeded by three years.
Last May, veterinarians and police officers detained 80 kilograms of undocumented food, including dried fish, duck or frozen duck, at the market, some of which was mold-laced.
Putin telephoned Zelensky before the start of the ceasefire in Donbas, Kremlin criticizes planned elections
Russian President Vladimir Putin spoke by phone with his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelenskyy about the situation in the Donbass, where a new ceasefire is due to take effect at midnight.
According to the Kremlin, Putin criticized the decision of the Ukrainian parliament to hold local elections; Kiev reported that Zelensky called for the release of detained Ukrainians.
A new ceasefire was agreed on Wednesday evening by negotiators from Ukraine and Russia, with the support of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE).
The ceasefire is to begin after midnight on Monday night, be "complete and general", and pave the way for the fulfillment of other provisions of the peace agreements.
Putin told Zelensky in an interview that the decision of the Ukrainian parliament to hold local elections is contrary to the Minsk peace agreement and threatens the prospects for settling the conflict in eastern Ukraine.
The Ukrainian parliament decided last week that the upcoming local elections will not take place in the territory controlled by pro-Russian rebels.
The Minsk agreement provides that Kiev will regain control of the Ukrainian territories occupied by the separatists with Russia after granting these regions broad autonomy and holding local elections.
According to the Union Agency, Zelensky's office said that the two leaders agreed on the benefits of the forthcoming ceasefire in Donbass and the need to take further measures to promote peace in the region, such as demining combat areas or withdrawing some troops from the front.
Zelensky also called on Putin to release Ukrainians detained in eastern Ukraine, the occupied Crimea and Russia itself.
The Minsk agreement helped to stop the fighting, but people continue to die in occasional gun battles and artillery attacks on both sides of the front lines.
The conflict in Donbass has claimed over 14,000 lives since spring 2014.
Ukraine and the West accuse Russia of military support for the separatists, which Moscow denies.
Zelensky made ending the war in Donbass his priority, but no major breakthrough in negotiations has yet been made.
The unexpected champion in the decathlon is Rykel, the seven-boat was dominated by Novotná
The defending champion of the last two titles, Dolega, failed to finish Saturday's 400, and Kopecký failed to make the pole-to-bottom on Sunday.
The decathlon was long ruled by Latvian representative Reinis Kregers, who is preparing in the group of coach Josef Karas, but after the discus he resigned.
Rykl had two bronze medals from the outdoor MCR, this time he was the only decetiboyer to cross the seven-thousand mark.
Other medals were won by Vilém Strásský and Petr Urbánek.
The after-show recalled the absence of Adam Sebastian Helcel and Jiří Sýkory.
"It's a shame the boys weren't here and Kope didn't pitch, 'cause then the results would look completely different.
But the title tastes really good, and I appreciate the fact that I put the character at 30 centimeters away.
Then I was pleased with the stick and I was disappointed with the disc, I was below average", he admitted on the Facebook page of the league.
On the first day of the seven-fight battle, Katerina Cach won by more than a hundred points, despite suffering from an injured ankle on her reflex leg.
In the long-distance sector, however, she then registered only 570 cm, did not throw 40 meters with the spear and did not enter the final eight.
Novotná scored 5878 points and won by 241 points ahead of Katerina Dvořáková.
She was especially far, 631 cm is the best Czech performance of the year.
"I wish it was about 630.
Yesterday I started to get a little bit of a limp, but I'm very happy that I didn't feel it at all and that it didn't limit me at all", Novotná said on the association's Facebook page.
Bio LPG has arrived in the Czech Republic, promising ecological operation
Liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) is a well-known alternative fuel in the Czech Republic.
It is popular mainly because of its substantially lower price compared to petrol or diesel, given the significantly lower excise duty, but its benefit is also in lower CO2 emissions per kilometre travelled.
Like gasoline and diesel, there is also an environmentally friendly alternative - "bio-LPG".
It is a novelty, however - it first appeared on the European market a year ago and arrived in the Czech Republic a few days ago, according to a press release from the Czech LPG Association.
"In these days we have received the first 15 tonnes of bio LPG, which will be distributed to our filling stations in a mixture with conventional fossil LPG", the association quotes Jiří Karlík from Primagas.
Bio-LPG cannot be considered as bioethanol or bio-diesel.
According to the association, it is chemically identical to the classic petroleum LPG that many motorists now fill their cars with.
Therefore, both versions can be mixed at will.
"The only difference from conventional LPG is the way it is produced", says Ivan Indracek, the association's chairman, about bio-LPG.
This is also one of the great advantages of bio-LPG over other alternative fuels.
It is easy to transport and store, and the distribution infrastructure is also quite good, for example compared to hydrogen or electricity.
Currently, this gas is obtained as a by-product in the production of bioethanol from food waste and sugar cane.
In the future, it should also be produced on a targeted basis, for example from cellulose biomass, i.e. wood waste.
In contrast, conventional petroleum LPG is produced partly as a by-product of oil refining, partly by separation in natural gas extraction.
As a result, depending on the production technology and source, the carbon footprint of a bio-LPG car is 40-70% lower than that of a petroleum LPG car and up to 90% lower than that of a diesel car.
However, it is not the CO2 emissions from the car's exhaust but the ecology of fuel production, i.e. the 'well-to-tank' part.
Some of the largest producers of bio-LPG currently include the petrochemical companies Eni, Total and Neste.
According to the recent update of the National Clean Mobility Action Plan (NAP ČM), Unipetrol is also exploring the possibility of production at its Lithuanian refinery.
According to the association's estimates, there are about 170,000 LPG-powered vehicles in the Czech Republic; the Ministry of the Environment gives a slightly higher figure in the NAP ČM, about 200,000.
According to statistics from the Ministry of Transport, almost 6,000 LPG-powered conversions were made last year alone.
LPG can be refuelled in the Czech Republic at approximately 950 stations of various operators.
Vojtěch revised the numbers of infected, the number dropped by 1775 cases
Health Minister Adam Vojtěch (ANO) ordered the ministry to review the numbers of people infected with the coronavirus.
The new statistics were published on Sunday by the Ministry of Health on its website.
The number of cases dropped from 5,254 on Saturday afternoon to 3,479, a decrease of 1,775 cases.
So there are currently 3,422 sick people in the Czech Republic.
"The surge in the number of people cured is due to a revision of the data, which has been delayed by the health authorities", said Jaroslav Dušek, head of health statistics.
By Sunday afternoon, 15 212 people were infected with the coronavirus in the Czech Republic, 11 419 recovered and 371 Covid-19 patients unfortunately succumbed.
Mobile voting units or correspondence election.
A political scientist and a sociologist were looking for alternatives for the pandemic.
In order for people in quarantine due to coronavirus to be able to vote in the October regional and senatorial elections, according to Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Interior Jana Hamáčka (ČSSD), a change in the law is necessary.
Parliament could debate it in August or September in an accelerated procedure.
He mentioned it on Sunday on TV Prima Party.
He wants to discuss a possible solution with the representatives of the parliamentary parties at the Ministry on Tuesday.
"Whatever we do, it will have to mean changing the electoral law", Hamáček said.
The Senate on Wednesday urged the government to find a solution within the framework of the current legal rules.
But the minister said that the law that says people in quarantine cannot vote because of their health condition will need to be amended.
The ban on voting should be maintained, for example, for patients with open tuberculosis.
Daniel Prokop stated on the OVM programme that the possibility of a correspondence election had been postponed since 2004.
Even the current bill, which is in the House, then counts on its introduction for voting abroad, but not in the Czech Republic.
Prokop also considers that the concerns of ANO or ČSSD (since, according to experience from abroad, this would rather be recorded to other types of parties) about the correspondence election are overstated.
He personally opposes the possibility of electronic voting, where there is a significant risk of abuse.
He said that now it is necessary to devise ad hoc mechanisms (elections) which could be carried out this year and with the least possible health risk.
The main thing is to be ready for the 2021 parliamentary elections in the Czech Republic.
It considers the choice of correspondence (whether abroad or in the Czech Republic) as one of its functional methods.
They also see the aforementioned electoral units or perhaps the possibility of a family vote.
He added that it is possible to learn how similar situations - elections during the coronavirus - were handled in Croatia, Poland or France.
This year, elections have already been postponed in 67 countries due to the spread of the coronavirus.
Protests in Bucharest: Protesters throw pig ears at government building
Participants in a demonstration against Bulgarian Prime Minister Boyko Borisov and his cabinet threw pig ears at the government building.
This was another in a series of protests against the "mafia-style of government" that have been taking place in Sofia and other cities for almost three weeks.
Organizers are planning a nationwide lockdown Wednesday, the DPA said.
Today's protest, which has been going on for 18 consecutive days, had a lower turnout than the previous one, according to Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty.
By 8:00 p.m., about 300 people had gathered, and some streets had to be closed to traffic.
Demonstrators outside the government building staged a theatrical scene, symbolically locking in the prison cell Prime Minister Borisov and Prosecutor General Ivan Geshev in connection with the arrest of two advisers of President Rumen Radev, a strong political opponent of the prime minister.
Resignation of both is one of the basic demands of the protesters.
They also demanded the cancellation of the announced healthcare reform and an end to corruption in construction on the Black Sea coast.
Protests organizer Nikolai Hadjigenov said on public radio today that Wednesday is the "peak of escalation" in the form of "a nationwide demonstration in Sofia and blockades across the country".
He repeatedly demanded the resignation of Borisov and his government, as well as the call for early elections.
The proper ones should take place in March 2021.
Borisov has already said he has no intention of resigning.
He justified this by, inter alia, the need to implement Bulgaria's COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting economic crisis.
But on Friday, he replaced five members of his government team, although the concession did not calm the protesters.
Earlier this week, Borisov's government stopped a vote of confidence in parliament.
Coach Boloni Mihajlovic doesn 't want to play games without spectators anymore .
Bologna's football coach, Siniša Mihajlović, is tired of the Italian league without spectators.
The Serbian coach hopes that from the new season, the fans will return to the stadiums.
"What we're running right now is not football.
I'm sick of games without spectators.
It's a non-sexual football, it doesn't bring me any emotion, no joy.
These fights are worse than training.
Playing like this is terrible and I think I'm not the only one who thinks that", Mihajlovic said before today's match against Lecce.
The coronavirus break is followed by the A-League games in quick succession, and even though they're played late at night, their players are exposed to the heat.
"We play every three days in the terrible heat.
You don't know what the teams are doing in these conditions.
I'm so tired of this season.
These measures had to be taken to finish the competition, but I hope that the fans will be back from September", said the coach, who has previously led both Fiorentina and AC Milan.
This season is also unusual for Mikhailovich because he missed four months on the bench for treatment of leukemia.
"Despite my illness, my league suspension and everything else, we've managed to take our team to the next level.
We want to continue to grow and we need the players to be mentally stronger", he said.
We've become the target of cyberattacks by foreign states, Iran claims
Since late June, fires and explosions have been reported at a number of Iranian military, industrial and nuclear facilities, as well as oil refineries, power plants, factories and businesses.
Some Iranian officials said that the fire that broke out at the Natanz underground nuclear facility this month could have been caused by cyber sabotage.
The cause of a number of other incidents has not yet been explained.
Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Abbas Mousavi told reporters that the Islamic Republic's infrastructure faces "thousands of cyber attacks every day", according to Iranian media.
He added that this was not a new phenomenon and that most of them could be prevented.
In recent months, several broader cyber attacks have been recorded, according to Mousavi, which were analyzed as being carried out by "certain governments and groups".
However, he did not provide details on the possible perpetrators, according to Reuters.
Musavi also added that fires in forests, refineries and other places are common in the summer.
An article by the Iranian state-run IRNA this month suggested that Iran's enemies, such as Israel and the United States, may be behind the recent incidents.
But none of these countries were directly blamed for specific attacks in the article.
Iran and the United States severed diplomatic relations shortly after the 1979 revolution, when Iranian militant students attacked the American embassy in Tehran and held 52 Americans hostage for 444 days.
Long-standing tensions between the two countries escalated in 2018 after Washington withdrew from the 2015 nuclear deal between Iran and world powers and imposed sanctions on Iran that are having a severe impact on its economy.
Another major escalation came this year after the US military killed Iranian General Qassem Soleimani and Iraqi militia leader Abu Mahdi Muhandis on January 3.
Then, on January 8th, Iran fired a number of missiles at American bases in Iraq.
The US has even conceded that dozens of US soldiers have been wounded.
Israel considers Iran its arch-enemy and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is a leading opponent of the 2015 international nuclear deal with Iran.
The Israeli prime minister has said Iran is trying to develop a nuclear bomb, which Iran denies.
TPCA car company extended production suspension, now until May 25th
The Cologne-based Toyota Peugeot Citroën Automobile (TPCA) has again extended its production suspension due to the coronavirus.
The production lines are expected to be restarted on Monday morning, May 25.
The charge will be accompanied by dozens of hygienic measures, said carmaker Tomáš Paroubek.
Production has been stalled due to the coronavirus pandemic since the evening of March 18.
The company originally planned to renew it on Monday, May 18.
The reason for the extension is that the borders are closed and the dealerships are closed, so there's no one to sell the cars.
According to Paroubek, the company will produce 100% from the beginning, so it will be two shifts.
The coronavirus has hit key markets such as Italy, the UK and Spain.
Mayor Michael Kaspar (Change for Cologne) said that the shutdown of TPCA does not affect life in the city.
"It was known from the beginning, the city was empty.
But gradually the streets are filling up, especially now that Monday has been a lot more relaxed.
So the city is full", said Kaspar.
He says there are no complications with the foreign workers staying in the hostels.
"In those two months, we had hardly any problems to solve", said Kaspar.
For example, Škoda Auto of Mladá Boleslav, which also suspended production due to the coronavirus crisis, resumed production on Monday, April 27 at all three of its production plants in the Czech Republic.
None of the plants are running at 100 percent capacity.
More than 80 hygiene measures were implemented to restore production in Škoda.
On the night of Monday to Tuesday, the third shift, the night shift, was held in Mladá Boleslav and Kvasiny for the first time since the resumption of production.
TPCA currently employs around 2500 people and is one of the largest exporters in the Czech Republic and an employer in Cologne.
Bride killed by cancer shortly after marriage, leaving a note to family
For more than two years Gemma Sisson battled a treacherous cancer, and just when it seemed she had beaten the cancer, it came back.
A 39-year-old woman who loved bodybuilding ended up in a hospice bed, where she still had time to marry the love of her life.
Unfortunately, she succumbed to her illness.
A few hours after her death, a shocking message appeared on her Facebook account for her loved ones.
Gemma Sisson, from Leeds, England, loved bodybuilding.
With her boyfriend Ricky Moore, with whom she lived for over 16 years, she traveled to competitions around the world.
The 39-year-old was a healthy athlete, but she was diagnosed with cancer in April 2018.
Gemma began exhausting treatment, radiation therapy, in the hope of recovering.
After months of treatment, Gemma did seem to have overcome the cancer, but in August 2019, the cancer returned, this time to the spine.
The bodybuilder and personal trainer underwent a ten-hour spine operation and then resumed drastic treatment, according to Britain's Daily Mirror.
But it was all for nothing.
Earlier this year, on her 39th birthday, the doctors told her that she had only a few months to live.
In April, the beautiful blonde finally decided to enter a hospice in Leeds, where she was visited by her family at all times, who even arranged for her to marry her love, Ricky.
The marriage lasted two months.
Ricky took Gemma to the restaurant for their two-month anniversary last time.
Four days later, Gemma died in his arms.
Just hours after her death, a post appeared on her social media account that Gema had written for her family.
"If this is published, it means that I have finally died after weeks of too long fighting.
Although I will be heartbroken to leave my loved ones, I will be so happy to be rid of what this terrible disease has caused me.
I can't thank Ricky enough for being by my side all the time and giving me a tremendous amount of love and support during this terrible time", she wrote on social media, saying that the pain and suffering had finally stopped and she had found peace.
"I am also grateful for all the support I have received from all my followers on social media", she wrote, adding that everyone should value their life and live it to the fullest.
Art vending machines sell sweat charms, sponge amulets and pexes
For 100 crowns, a passing pocket work is bought by mostly beginner Czech artists.
They create drawings and other creations directly for the artmat, so they know in the front that they have to fit in a size of 8.5 by 5.5 centimeters.
Each piece is numbered and signed.
"The package always contains a curated text about the artist and then the work itself", said Petra Widżová, the project's curator.
Artmat works by chance.
This allows the buyer to be surprised by the artwork they are about to receive.
Currently, it can become the new owner of fantastic illustrations by Alexandra Štoplová or mini-glass by Teresa Bonaventura, which can also be sent.
Punx 23 artist in collaboration with Dora Dutko has prepared a pexeso associated with the Prague walk.
The cards need to be paired with the house markings.
Ilona Polanski has created a collection of tattoos for Artmat.
Marie Ladro and Juliana Chom sell pocket-sized spirituality packages: the first artist offers a protective amulet from a midwife and a fortune-telling card, the second a series of illustrations based on her comic book Spiritist.
Healthcare salaries are going up by five percent next year.
A higher increase is unrealistic according to Vojtěch
Salaries in the health sector could rise by five percent next year, Health Minister Adam Vojtěch (ANO) said in Questions from Václav Moravce on Czech Television.
He considers the union demand for a 15% increase unrealistic.
He also said that the state should try to be self-sufficient in providing protective equipment.
He says hospitals have their supply now.
"I think the increase (in wages) could be somewhere up to five percent", the minister said.
He said that the current situation, which has affected the selection of the coronavirus pandemic insurance policy and government regulations against its spread since March, should be reflected.
Insurance companies' revenues have fallen during that period.
"I think a 15 percent increase is unrealistic at this point", said Vojtěch.
The average monthly salary of an acute bedside care doctor, according to data from the Institute for Health Information and Statistics (IHIS), is likely to reach CZK 88,312 this year, and that of a nurse CZK 47,498.
The difference between the salaries of nurses in state hospitals and those of other founders will be up to seven thousand crowns.
The data from the SIPS also show that the decline in nurses in hospitals has stopped.
The average wage in the Czech Republic in 2019 was CZK 34 125, according to the Czech Statistical Office.
Trade union representatives said in June that they would demand a minimum wage increase of 10 percent, ideally 15 percent, for 2021.
They criticize the long-standing significant difference between the salaries of doctors and nurses in state hospitals, which have to follow the pay tables, and contract salaries in city, regional or private hospitals.
They also demand that the pay tables for health workers be uniform.
For nurses, the difference this year will be up to seven thousand crowns a month.
But in the medical field, for example, wages grew faster than salaries last year.
According to the president of the Czech Dental Chamber, Roman Šmucler, the trade unionists should perceive the current state of affairs.
The House recently approved an increase in the state budget deficit this year to a record 500 billion crowns due to the impact of the COVID epidemic, of which 1.75 billion is to go to the salaries of health workers in hospitals and social services.
The board of health care providers, according to Schmuckler, is against a comprehensive pay rise next year.
He argued that the remuneration should be decided by the hospitals and healthcare facilities themselves and the extra money should go to them through the Compensation Ordinance.
Vojtěch also stated that hospitals currently have enough protective equipment.
The chairman of the State Material Reserves Administration (SSHR) Pavel Švagr said this week that the administration does not currently have a single protective medical device in its possession.
He's waiting for the selection process to be completed.
According to Vojtěch, the suppliers in the world are now able to deliver goods better than in March, when they were bought out.
The state should try to be as self-sufficient as possible and buy from Czech companies.
The military could take over the quarantine with a clever shake.
We're ready, they're sending
"Smart quarantine works, there's a lot to improve, of course.
We're gonna discuss that with the army tonight.
The army is working perfectly and the question is whether they should not be running the whole thing again", the prime minister said on his Facebook show Hello People on Sunday.
According to him, the IT systems and sanitary stations are not sufficiently interconnected and must gradually switch to more modern operating methods.
The problems were, according to the Prime Minister, in the Moravian-Silesian region, where one of the current outbreaks of the epidemic is.
Defense Ministry spokesman Jan Pejšek told the CBC that he had no information about Sunday's meeting and that the government should discuss the matter on Monday.
He says the army is ready for that move.
The smart quarantine project was taken over by the Ministry of Health on May 25th.
Until then, the smart quarantine was led by a 90-member central management team set up under the military as an advisory body to the government, led by former deputy minister Roman Prymula.
The project was criticized by Interior Minister Jan Hamáček (ČSSD) on Sunday.
He also suggested that the army might recapture it.
The Commission also considers that the measures in question are not compatible with the internal market.
"The system works, but it's still a work in progress.
For 20 years, it was built in isolation and without a system, now we're trying to consolidate it in a few months.
It's not a jet.
People walking, poor people in toilets walking are adapting to these new systems and actually taking advantage of the mistakes", he said.
Ostrava Mayor Macura will not run again, because he does not want to "dumb around in politics"
The current Ostrava mayor Tomáš Macura (ANO) will not run in the next municipal elections.
The reason is to try not to "dumb around in politics", he told Respekt.cz.
Macura, who is also a member of the ANO leadership, has been the mayor of Ostrava since November 2014.
In the municipal elections in 2018, the candidate of the ANO movement in Ostrava won almost a third of the votes.
Macura originally wanted to be in office for only four years.
"I thought I'd last one term and with my business experience I could turn everything around and get it back on its feet", he told Respektu.
He added that he had been persuaded to some extent to run for a second term.
"But for me, it's the maximum.
I don't want to fool around in politics", added Macura, who described himself in an interview as a difficult introvert who doesn't like frequent contact with people.
According to Respect, there's been speculation for some time about Macur's possible demise in the NAO movement.
The server recalls that Macura has repeatedly criticized the ANO movement, for example for its alliance with the SPD movement or for supporting Milos Zeman in the presidential elections.
As one of the few ANO personalities, he supported Zeman's opponent Jiří Drahoš in the elections.
Macura has no plans to leave ANO, which he joined in 2017.
"As long as I feel that I can make a difference in the movement, that it is not a completely useless fight and that no one is trying to get me involved, I have no immediate motive to quit", he told Respektu.
The 56-year-old Macura graduated from the University of Economics in Prague.
Before becoming mayor of Ostrava in 2014, Macura was, among other things, the CEO of the pharmaceutical company Walmark.
He sat on the boards of other companies.
Uber returns to Brno offering transport services
Uber, which offers transport services, will return to Brno at the end of July.
This is the result of the law change, Brno Transport Councillor Petr Kratochvíl (ODS) said in a press statement on Thursday.
Taxi drivers protested Uber in Brno, pointing out that Uber does not meet conditions such as being designated as a taxi or a taxi meter.
However, the amendment of the law changed the conditions for the operation of ordinary taxis and alternative taxis from July.
Kratochwil has had several meetings with Uber representatives in recent weeks.
"On the basis of these, this company decided to return to Brno with its services at the end of July this year.
This step is the result of a change in the law that allows the company to operate legally.
The city has been informed of this change and we believe that the company will operate its services within the given boundaries,' said Kratochvíl.
Uber has been operating in Brno in the past.
They protested against the taxi driver for not labeling the vehicles as taxi or missing a meter.
The court issued a restraining order prohibiting Uber from driving in the city.
Brno initially supported taxi drivers, but at the end of last year, Mayor Markéta Vaňková (ODS) said the city would like to take steps to make Uber work in Brno.
According to the subsequent court decisions, Uber could operate in Brno, but the company did not take advantage of this.
Now he's coming back under a change in the law.
Since July, in addition to traditional taxi lights and metered taxis, a booked and paid service can be operated more easily exclusively through mobile applications.
Too much celebration in Brno: flying chairs dropped a meter from a man on the sidewalk
An office chair flew out of the fourth floor of an apartment building in Brno on Saturday evening and landed about a meter from the sidewalk.
He was followed by a walker who immediately called the guards.
The patrol, soon after arriving at the address in the western part of the city, noticed an open window, under which a chair was still lying, and a few cans and dumplings were next to it.
"The movement from the fourth-floor room suggested a rather loud celebration was taking place inside.
The guards went out through the corridor to the apartment and asked the three young men present, aged between 26 and 29, for explanations", said spokesman Jakub Ghanem.
The request for Rafaje's appeal will be discussed by Babiš with ČSSD
Prime Minister Andrej Babis (ANO) plans to discuss with the coalition Social Democrats on Monday the demand for the proposal to dismiss the head of the Antimonopoly Office (OHCHR) Peter Rafaj.
The appeal was called by non-profit organizations to the anti-corruption council of the government and also the Ústecký kraj.
The Social Democrats are reporting that a change in leadership is in order.
According to the information of the CTC, Rafaj was not invited to the Government Office on Monday.
His second term expires in the middle of next year, and by law, he can't run for a third term.
His removal is within the competence of President Milos Zeman.
In addition to the call of non-profit organizations, the Prime Minister also received a letter with a similar request from the Ústecký Region.
The reason is, among other things, the recent cases of Rafa.
Last week, the prime minister refused to comment on the request, saying he would review the materials and that the government would take "some kind of position".
He also stated that he had not yet discussed the challenges with the president, and that he had not arranged a meeting with him in the near future.
According to the HSE, there is no reason to appeal, because Rafaj has not been charged with anything.
The servers IHNED.cz and Aktuálně.cz wrote last week that the police are interested in Rafaj's meetings with the hejtman Jiří Čunk.
The meetings were linked to the decision to contest the controversial new 8 billion-dollar hospital project in Zlín, which Čunek is pushing hard.
The guy admitted to the meeting, that they were dealing with his "senate activities".
That's how Raphael talks.
The representative office of the Usteck region called on the government to dismiss Rafaja at the end of June.
It also calls for a reform of the Authority's decision-making mechanisms.
The decision-making of the OHIM on public procurement according to Deputy Heytman for Transport Jaroslav Komínek is not transparent and has arbitrary characteristics.
Last March, the police intervened in the antitrust bidding process.
In June this year, the Aktuálně.cz server pointed out that Rafaj uses apartments registered to the company of the influential backstage player of the Czech Social Democratic Party, Alexander Cuby.
But the $3.5 million advance on the Brno apartment was paid from Rafaj's account.
Rafaj has been President of the Competition Authority since 9 July 2009, having been appointed by the President of the former Social Democratic Party in June 2015 for a second term.
In less than a year, Rafais second six-year term will expire.
The Antitrust Act states that the President may remove the head of the Office on a proposal from the Government.
He may be dismissed only if he has not been in office for more than six months or if he seriously undermines the dignity of his office or the independence and impartiality of the Office.
The library in Blence was collapsing hot.
Air conditioning will help.
The new equipment will cost $740,000 and be in service in the second half of August.
"It's good news for me.
We go to the library in downtown Blanks regularly with three kids.
But in the warmer months, it was practically impossible to survive.
It was so hot and bad air.
The ventilation didn't work.
That's why I like air conditioning", said one of the readers of the Blenny paper, Petr Novotny.
According to library director Lukáš Dlapy, temperatures in the building often climbed to over thirty degrees.
The southern wall of the building is glazed and functions as a greenhouse on sunny days.
"The sun also rests in it for much of the day because of the curvature of the building.
At the same time, ventilation of individual compartments is a major problem, since windows must be closed at night for safety reasons.
Often, it's 30 degrees in the library in the morning", said Dlapa.
The worst was the study and reading room on the third floor.
And one floor up, the showroom and the principal's office.
The children's ward, located under the roof of the building, was also unpleasant.
"On several occasions, librarians have collapsed at work and ended up unable to work.
The problem was also a regular occurrence in the cultural room at lectures attended by dozens of people.
After a few minutes, it was impossible to breathe", noted Dlap.
The city originally wanted to air-condition all the library's facilities this year.
It'll end up being three laps of five.
"Because of limited funding, only the most disadvantaged areas will have air conditioning.
Studio and reading room on the third floor.
Then the cultural room and the children's department are a floor higher", informed Jiří Svoboda from the Blenensk Investment Department.
He added that in the first phase, workers had already installed ventilation and adjusted the electrical installation in the mentioned premises last autumn.
It's about 360,000 crowns.
The city library of Blansko has almost three thousand registered readers.
That's about 900 to 15 years.
The Chicago supporters have driven the coronavirus out.
Crawford is back in the game.
Not every athlete infected with the virus comes out with the truth.
Especially when it comes to NHL players, who are silent about the health of their players and don't release anything.
One of the few to emerge from the Crawford line.
The 35-year-old Montreal native was only present for the first practice session, and has been missing from the squad ever since.
"I want to inform you all that I have tested positive for COVID-19 and as a result I have been confined to my home for the past 14 days", he revealed the reason for his absence.
The fans don't have to worry about his health anymore.
Crawford is ready to throw himself back into full-on.
"It's great to be back.
I will do everything to get back in shape as soon as possible", he added.
The experienced goalie has won two Stanley Cups with Chicago, and he's been a fixture on the field for the 10th straight season.
The Blackhawks are going to have a preseason game with St. Louis, then they're going to face Edmonton in the preseason.
Thousands protested in Israel against the prime minister
Thousands of Israelis in several parts of the country have protested against unemployment, corruption and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's handling of the coronavirus crisis.
The demonstrations took place in front of Netanyahu's private villa in Caesarea, near his official residence, and in a park in Tel Aviv, among others.
Protests have been taking place regularly in Jerusalem and Tel Aviv for several weeks.
The participants are demanding Netanyahu's resignation due to the trial in which he is accused of corruption and fraud, as well as the way the government is dealing with the next wave of the coronavirus epidemic.
"Bibi, go home", one of the protesters wrote on his banner, according to the AP, referring to Netanyahu's common nickname.
"Everyone sees that the emperor has lost his dress", it said on another.
The 70-year-old Netanyahu is the first Israeli prime minister to be tried in office.
He's charged with three counts of corruption, fraud and breach of trust.
He denies all charges and calls them witch hunts.
According to local media, the trial could take up to three years, with over 300 witnesses summoned.
The SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus has been confirmed in almost 60,500 people in Israel, which has a population of about nine million.
455 people died from the disease.
The Israeli government introduced quarantine measures in March that helped reduce the daily increase in infections.
However, after the gradual easing of restrictions from the end of April, the number of infected people began to increase again significantly, especially at the end of June.
Netanyahu's critics argue that the government has not provided sufficient assistance, for example, to the quarantined industries.
The protesters are also concerned that the government is issuing conflicting directives in the fight against the coronavirus.
The driver crashed his car into a tree and died.
The body must have been cut out of the wreckage by the fire department.
The tragic accident happened at around 11 p.m. near Neveklov, in the narrow district leading from the Slapka dam.
The driver apparently ran at considerable speed down into the woods and crashed his car into a tree.
He died on the spot.
The fire department had to remove the body from the wreckage, cutting off the roof, among other things.
Police are investigating the circumstances of the crash.
They ordered an autopsy, which would, among other things, determine whether the man was driving under the influence of alcohol or other drugs.
No more wasting and throwing one collection after another.
Pietro Filipi cancels the discounts and bets on sustainability
The Czech clothing brand Pietro Filipi wants to focus on sustainability and is embarking on a fundamental change of strategy.
He's cancelling the discounts and he doesn't want to throw one collection after another.
The fact that the fashion industry is among the world's biggest polluters is nothing new.
Billions of pieces of clothing end up in incinerators and landfills every year.
The view of slow fashion, an often-dismissed approach to dress, has been changing quite rapidly in recent years.
About half of the goods were sold by Pietro Filipi at full price.
The other half, which was sold at a discount, they're not gonna buy that easily.
The company doesn't want to be throwing one collection after another and at the end of each season, discounting the products below their manufacturing price.
Moreover, according to owner Michal Mičky, the days of new and old collections and blindly following fast-changing fashion trends are over.
"Most retailers count on discounts when they buy goods, so a much higher margin is included in the full price.
So it's actually a bit of a scam", says Michal Mička, owner of Pietro Filipi.
Moreover, the company's approach also aims to support local businesses.
"Each of our products is made from carefully selected high-quality materials and designed by local designers.
We emphasize that a large part of our collection is made up of so-called basic pieces - that is, clothes that are timeless and out of season.
The premium brand segment is typical worldwide for the absence of any discounts, the price of the product simply corresponds to its quality and the discount is not necessary,' adds Mička.
The giant graffiti depicts RAF pilot Kurt Taussig
"The task was to create something for the anniversary of the end of the war.
And I remembered our fighter pilot who fought in the ranks of the British Royal Air Force in World War II.
The city council liked the proposal", said Vacek, who completed the work after 14 days of intensive work.
He used about 300 liters of paint and 50 sprays.
Kurt Taussig was born in 1923 in Teplice-Shanov.
He left town when he was 15.
During the war, because of his Jewish background, the Nazis took him to an internment camp, where he was held for several weeks.
However, thanks to the organization of Nicholas Winton, he and his brother were able to avoid the concentration camp.
In 1939, Taussig made his way to Britain, where he volunteered for the Royal Air Force (RAF), and subsequently underwent pilot training in Southern Rhodesia and Palestine.
He joined combat operations in early 1945.
After the Velvet Revolution, he visited the Czech Republic several times, including his native Teplice, which granted him honorary citizenship.
The 46-year-old Kamil Vacek, known to people in the street art industry as Camo, has been spraying the streets of Teplice for over 20 years.
He started with graffiti on areas set aside for these purposes by then mayor Jaroslav Kubera (ODS).
Hurricane Hanna has made landfall off the coast of Texas.
Hurricane Hanna made landfall on the southwest coast of the U.S. state of Texas on Saturday afternoon, local time (before midnight EST).
It struck Texas' Padre Island, about 15 miles [24 km] north of Port Mansfield, and weakened into a tropical storm as it moved over the mainland.
However, meteorologists say that it still poses a serious threat to coastal communities.
The storm brought strong winds and heavy rainfall, and local flooding has been accompanied by reports of power outages and property damage, including damage to ships, according to the AP.
Texas Governor Greg Abbott declared a state of emergency for 32 counties in southwest Texas on Saturday and recommended voluntary evacuation.
The strongest warnings were issued to people in the coastal zone between Port Mansfield and Mesquite Bay, but the storm is expected to strike an area nearly 300 miles long before moving gradually over northeastern Mexico.
"Although Hanna is now a tropical storm, heavy rain and wind, rising sea levels, dangerous hail and rare tornadoes may pose a threat", warned the U.S. National Hurricane Center (NHC).
This morning local time, the storm was moving across the U.S.-Mexico border, accompanied by winds of 85 kilometers per hour.
Hanna became the first hurricane of this year's Atlantic hurricane season on Saturday.
Over the Gulf of Mexico, winds of up to 90 miles per hour [145 km/ h] weakened to 70 miles per hour [112 km/ h] as it made landfall, again disqualifying Hannah from hurricane status.
Local authorities urged residents to stay home during the storm, while also taking hygiene measures to prevent the spread of the coronavirus.
Texas is one of the states most affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.
In view of the existing security measures and the need to maintain distance, evacuations are also a major challenge.
Temporary shelters have been opened in hotels, schools and gyms.
In Hidalgo County, Texas, one of the buildings was also adapted as a shelter for evacuees who tested positive for coronavirus or were otherwise exposed to the infection.
Local authorities urged all evacuees to take blankets and disinfectant gels with them to the shelter if possible.
"We're not even close to being done yet.
We're expecting catastrophic flooding", Chris Birchfield, who works for the National Weather Service (NWS) service in Brownsville, said.
Forecasts say that in some places up to 300 millimeters [300 millimeters] of rain could fall in a few hours, in some cases as much as 500 millimeters [500 millimeters], and that, together with rising sea levels, many coastal settlements could be flooded.
Zeman will lend the rank of general to Colonel Lipko
President Miloš Zeman will hand over the rank of general to Colonel Pavel Lipko on Wednesday.
It's coming from the DOD's expected event log.
The reason for the promotion to the rank of brigadier general is Lipka's August appointment as deputy commander of the Alliance Multinational Division in North-East Poland.
Lipka still acts as deputy commander of the Czech Army Ground Forces.
Zeman's promotion was proposed by the government at the end of June.
Lipka will replace Brigadier General Karel Řehka as deputy commander of the multinational Northeast Division in Elblago, Poland, which commands the Allied advance presence in Poland and the Baltic.
In March, he became the Director of the National Office for Cyber and Information Security (NÚKIB).
The government has proposed to the president that Lipko be promoted to brigadier general.
According to the Law on the Military Profession, a higher rank may be lent to a soldier for the duration of the elected office or for the duration of the service task which the higher rank loan requires.
The rank of Deputy Commander of the Alliance Division is equivalent to General.
A soldier who has been awarded a rank shall have the same rights and duties as if he had been appointed to that rank.
However, he is not entitled to a salary adjustment corresponding to his grade.
The assignment of a rank shall continue until the reason for which it was granted is no longer applicable.
"Colonel Lipka demonstrates high professional readiness and is an example to his subordinates.
He is significantly involved in the tasks of the Czech Armed Forces, including cooperation with foreign partners and ensuring the participation of the army in foreign operations", the Ministry of Defence said in June on the proposal for promotion.
Wednesday's promotion will take place at 12:30 at Prague Castle, attended by Minister of Defense Lubomír Metnar or Chief of General Staff Aleš Opata.
EU countries have coronavirus standards for aviation
European Union countries have agreed on common hygiene standards for air travel to help limit the spread of the new coronavirus.
This was announced by the German Minister of Transport Andreas Scheuer.
The agreed standards include the observance of spacing or wearing of headscarves on board and at the airport, but the middle seats on aircraft will not have to remain unoccupied.
This was reported by Reuters.
"I am glad that my colleagues have accepted the German proposal for Europe and that we have been able to agree on these common standards", Scheuer said at the European Aviation Conference.
The German Ministry of Transport then added that the agreement had been concluded by officials and had yet to be formally approved by the ministers.
The agreed measures include a requirement to cover the mouth and nose for passengers from the age of six, and to observe the recommended distance during security checks and airport check-in.
Sufficient fresh air must also be guaranteed on board and all information must be available in several languages.
Airlines will also be able to occupy the middle seats.
The common rules agreed by the officials meet at least some of the requirements of the airlines.
Different standards caused confusion.
The Arctic Spitzbergen has recorded a record temperature of almost 22 degrees.
"A 41-year-old record has fallen in Longyearbyen", the Norwegian Meteorological Institute said on Twitter.
The temperature rose to 21.7 degrees Celsius in the afternoon, 0.4 degrees above the 1979 record, he added.
Longyearbyen, about 2,000 miles [1,300 km] from the North Pole, is the largest town in the Spitsbergen.
The Spitzbergen are warming faster than almost any other place on Earth.
This fact highlights the dangers of warming in other parts of the Arctic - from Alaska to Siberia, says a report last year by the Norwegian Centre for Climate Studies.
He says the average temperature in Spitsbergen has risen by three to five degrees since the 1970's.
By 2100, it could rise by as much as 10 degrees if greenhouse gas emissions are not reduced.
The temperature rise could melt the permanently frozen land in Spitsbergen, threatening the stability of many buildings, roads, and airports, and could cause more avalanches and landslides.
Climate warming also threatens Arctic wildlife, such as polar bears and seals, which depend on the ocean's icy cover.
British returnees from Spain face mandatory two-week quarantine
The British Cabinet also urged citizens to avoid all non-essential travel to mainland Spain due to the risk of spreading COVID-19.
The Canary Islands and the Balearic Islands are not mentioned, but even after returning from them, people have to isolate themselves for two weeks.
The new rules go into effect at midnight.
"Protecting public health is our absolute priority.
We have taken this decision to prevent the possible spread of the virus in the UK", the British diplomatic service said in a statement.
"We have always made it clear that if necessary, we will immediately remove a country from the list of safe countries", she added.
As the British newspaper Metro noted, the latest announcement will affect the travel plans of thousands of Britons.
Spain is one of the most popular vacation destinations.
The British are concerned, among other things, about whether they will be paid sick pay if they have to end up in solitary confinement for 14 days after returning from their holidays.
For example, Neil Hunter from Sittingbourne booked a 10-day vacation to Lanzarote, leaving on Tuesday.
They've been booked since December.
"We were going to be the whole family, my wife Amanda and daughter Bethany, but to be honest, after this announcement, I don't know what's going to happen.
I work as a mechanic and I don't think my employer will accept that I will be quarantined for two weeks after returning from vacation", Metro Hunter newspaper quoted the article.
In the context of Spain, there are concerns that the country is at the beginning of a second wave of epidemics.
Over the last two days, there have been over 900 new infections in each 24 hours.
Authorities in some areas are already tightening coronavirus measures, with Catalonia, for example, trying to limit all nightlife and prevent people from gathering in large numbers.
The Czech Ministry of Foreign Affairs has recently raised the risk of infection in Catalonia, Aragon, the Basque Country and the Madrid region.
The model of purchasing electricity from Dukovan will be discussed by the government
The government will discuss a model for purchasing electricity from the planned new unit of the Dukovany nuclear power plant on Monday.
The draft law envisages that if the price of the electricity is higher than the market price of the power plant, all consumers will pay the difference through tariffs.
In the second case, where the purchase price is lower than the market price, the effect on consumers will be the opposite.
Power is the unregulated part of the final price of electricity to the customer.
Vice-Prime Minister and Minister of Industry Karel Havlíček (ANO) and the energy company ČEZ have already stated that the most likely option is that people will save electricity by building.
On the contrary, analysts point out that the long-term outlook for electricity prices in the markets is always uncertain, as has been demonstrated by developments in the past.
The plan has been criticized by environmental groups.
'The purchase price may be both below and above the market price of the power generated.
The final impact at the time of the applicability of the rule may thus be both negative and positive.
The impact will be distributed among customers according to the size of the fuse - at lower consumption or according to electricity consumption - at higher electricity consumption", the Ministry of Industry and Trade (MPO) said in the material submissions.
Havliček said in May that he expects the wholesale price of electricity to rise and the people at the Dukovan construction site to make a profit.
Otherwise, the impact would be in the tens of crowns per year per family, which is far less than what people pay in electricity bills each year to support the so-called subsidised sources.
It had previously estimated that the price could be between EUR 50 and EUR 60 per megawatt-hour (MWh).
The material submitted does not contain any proposal for an amount, it is to be contained only in the purchase agreement.
The price of electricity on the Prague Energy Exchange for 2021, which is now the most supplied by traders, is currently around 45 euros (about 1190 Kč) per MWh.
'A surcharge of EUR 10 between the purchase price and the market price of electricity from renewable sources could amount to less than CZK 100 per year for an average household consuming 3,3 MWh per year - equivalent to a household of four with standard electrical appliances including an electric cooking board and oven, but not using electricity for heating and hot water - ' the MPO government submission stated.
"We live in extremely turbulent times.
The coronavirus pandemic has shown us how vulnerable the global economy is.
For this reason, I consider long-term market price prediction to be a purely speculative matter,' said Tomáš Voltr, former CEO of the Energy financial group.
The proposed law envisages that the redemption would be carried out by MPO, or by a legal entity authorised by it, owned by the State at a predetermined price.
The investor-state contract guaranteeing the terms of the purchase of electricity would be concluded for a minimum of 30 years, with a possible extension of 10 years, including repeatedly, but at most until the end of low-carbon production.
It defines a low-carbon production design as a nuclear-powered electricity generation plant connected to the electricity grid with an installed capacity of at least 100 megawatts (MW) after 2030.
Havlíček previously stated that the new Dukovan unit should have a capacity of 1200 MW and produce nine terawatt hours of electricity per year, which would correspond to one tenth of the expected Czech consumption.
The unit is scheduled to be commissioned in 2036.
The financing model for the new Dukovan block was approved by the government on Monday.
The facility should be financed by the State at no interest when built, with a 2% interest rate for operation.
The opposition disagrees with the financing model, and is also concerned about the possibility of Russian or Chinese companies building the Dukovans.
The state should have a 70 percent stake in the construction.
The remainder should be paid by ČEZ, which will also cover any additional costs.
In May, CEZ Director General Daniel Beneš told the Czech Transport and Communications Commission that the expected amount for the construction of the block at current prices is about EUR 6 billion (approximately CZK 162 billion).
The contracts between the state and the CEZ for the construction of the new Dukovan block will be signed on Tuesday.
The Ministry of Local Development has pulled $2 billion in media tourism promotion material
The Ministry of Local Development (MMR) withdrew from the comments procedure material that indicated that it planned to spend two billion CZK in media, internet and billboards advertising holidays in the Czech Republic.
Minister Klára Dostálová (for ANO) on the SeznamZprávy.cz server said that the material is still being worked on.
The document was brought to the attention of the server Zdopravy.cz on Friday.
The Ministry of Tourism has explained the plan to the decline in tourism due to the coronavirus.
During the coronavirus crisis, the media and revenues have fallen.
The proposal has drawn criticism from the opposition and tourism representatives.
According to the proposal, which is now available on the website hlidacstatu.cz, MMR planned to give money for advertising on television, radio, print, on the Internet, billboards or on station platforms through the state agency for tourism support CzechTourism.
The biggest part of the money, 700 million crowns, would go to the TVs.
Most of it would go to private TV companies like Nova and Prima.
Printed newspapers and weeklies would receive 400 million, and the same amount would be given to the MMR for PR articles, advertising banners and videos on websites.
Radio stations would get $350 million for the media campaign, most of it again to private stations.
The remaining 150 million would be used for outdoor advertising on billboards, LED screens and station and subway signs.
The campaign to promote tourism in the Czech Republic was to start in mid-August and last for a year.
"The material is still being worked on, it is definitely not yet in the form that should be presented", Dostálová told the SeznamZprávy server without giving further details.
The material was criticized by the opposition, according to the head of TOP 09 Bakery Adamova, the media would profit from the advertising from the trust funds of Prime Minister Andrei Babis (ANO).
"I firmly believe this pompous contempt will get a slap in the face in the fall election", she tweeted.
Delivery denies that it is actually about helping the media affected by the crisis.
"It may be a coincidence, I don't know anything about media support", she told the N-Daily on Friday.
She says the $2 billion budget is indicative.
"We're still counting, of course, it can be less or more.
It's work material", she added.
The Save Tourism initiative does not make sense of a media campaign to promote domestic tourism.
"We want two billion for tourism companies, not a useless advertising campaign", said the chairman of the initiative, Tomáš Barčík, on Sunday.
If the two billion crowns are in the state budget, they should go to companies, not the media, the initiative writes in an open letter to the government.
The sauce of life, the cock of beer, and death like a stalk of grass.
The third album is also posthumously titled A smrt je stub trave brno poet, tireless organizer of cultural activities and publisher Jaroslav Erik Friče, who also left a year ago, on May 24.
It is the fifth entry in Fritch's discography and, like the previous titles, it focuses on Fritch's poetry, of which he is an excellent interpreter.
Frič, born in 1949, was naturally influenced by the American beat generation, but he passed on this inspiration through his own, uniquely presented experiences and also through very intimate expressions of faith.
But he was far from any agitation, and when he spoke or wrote about faith, about God, it was always very intimate, non-aggressive, completely tolerant.
I think in this context Bohuslav Reynek (in contrast to Jan Zahradniček), the masters will forgive.
Frič's album offers recordings of the authorship reading from 2006, but also performances with musicians who always accompanied him very sensibly, whether it was the cellist Josef Keyč, or Honza Barton and Vítězslav Holata.
I'd like to quote the words of the Ostravian poet Petr Hruska about Fric's long poetic compositions.
"It gave off a proud and unending bitterness", writes the Grape, "at the state of our world in danger of extinction.
A world that is increasingly plunged into dull consumerism and greed is increasingly distancing itself from what its soul was made of - the mystery of faith, humility and human closeness.
They were voiced by the longing for someone who knew that the values for which he was created were of little interest, but who also knew that they could not be abandoned for the sake of general indifference.
The poems reminded us that a person may have to lose everything dear, but it is not insignificant how he loses it.
If he gives himself up to general decadence, he resigns skeptically, shuts down in fear, or remains quietly and proudly insisting until the last moment on what he believes and loves".
"The wig is not my advisor", said Hamlet.
Former Prime Minister and Chairman of the CSDP Jiří Paroubek is not a paid adviser to social democracy.
The party chairman and Interior Minister Jan Hamáček only communicates with him and reads his opinions and articles.
Hamáček said it on the Prima Party TV show today.
On Friday, the server SeznamZprávy.cz reported that Paroubek should be Hamáček's advisor.
"We'll text each other from time to time, he'll send me some material and I'll read it", Hamáček said today.
It added that, however, this was not an official and paid cooperation.
According to him, the CSDP does not have the means to waste it for similar purposes.
"I read his opinion from time to time, so there are many of them", he said.
In a subsequent discussion with ODS MP Jana Černochová, the minister said that many ODS members are still "openly listening to the views of Václav Klaus".
He thinks it's okay because he's an experienced politician and former party chairman, which is also the case with Paroubka.
The fact that the media is making a big deal out of it has been a hallmark of this year's pickle season.
The SeznamZpráva.cz server wrote on Friday that Paroubek is acting as an unofficial consultant for Hamáček.
He also wrote that the fourth place for the party's candidate in the Uuseti region is headed by the former chairman of the cell there, Petr Benda, who is connected to Paroubka and served as vice chairman of his party LEV 21.
Hamáček said today that he won't comment on the composition of the candidate until it's ready and approved.
Duplantis has a mile lead, he's a kick in the ass, the Swedish challenger is miserable
The 22-year-old American barber has the ambition and potential to be one of the most serious competitors for the new ruler.
He already knows what it's like to beat Duplantis two years younger, last year at the NCAA meet.
"We had a battle a year before, he won and I was second, then we traded it.
Both times it was a very good fight", says Nilsen, who won by 5.95 metres.
But Duplantis has since shot steeply upwards and is currently isolated in the highest rod-sphere.
At just 20 years of age, he became the world record holder, breaking the 6.17-meter barrier in Torun on February 8, and gaining a centimeter more a week later in Glasgow.
"He jumped six meters at 18 when he finished high school", recalls his peer Nilsen for the World Athletics website.
"It was clear that once he grew from boy to man, he would multiply all his potential and talent tenfold.
Twenty is a pretty good age to jump the world record", he believes.
Nilsen's list of accomplishments being a little more narrow than the one Duplantis prides himself on, the American has similar goals.
He has hinted at his options so far at the NCAA Championships, which he has won regularly, this year in February, improving his personal best of 5.93 meters. Last August, he won the gold medal at the Pan American Games in Lima, and in 2017 he fought his way to the American expedition to the World Championships, where he finished 13th.
The next milestone for him is to taste the Diamond League for the first time.
"It's definitely my priority to get on the professional circuit and compete as much as possible in the Diamond League, because that's where you can make a name for yourself", he realizes.
"If you can do well at this level, you can undoubtedly do well at events like the Olympics, the World Championships, or the Pan American Games".
But because of the pandemic, these high-profile holidays are being postponed, giving Nilsen and the other stickers time to improve.
But will it be enough to catch up with Duplantis, who can easily turn a race under five laps into a mere silver fight?
"Everyone is trying to catch up, but I don't think it's going to be possible anytime soon", Nilsen reflects.
"This kid's been jumping for 16 years and he's a mile ahead of everyone else in training".
And before Tokyo 2021 starts, he's going to want to raise it even more.
A woman spent hundreds of thousands on a disabled son's pension.
She's going to court.
The money that the 33-year-old man receives from the state as an invalidity pension is primarily intended to improve his quality of life.
A woman faces up to eight years in prison for embezzlement.
Because of his poor health, the court stripped the sick man of his rights and appointed his mother as his guardian, who was also to manage his son's money.
"From mid-November 2013 to January of this year, the woman used part of her son's disability pension for her own needs and raised 440,000 crowns", police spokeswoman Dana Ladman said, alleging that the accused had a special duty to protect the interests of the victim as a guardian.
The woman, under court order, set up an account for her son, but she had his pension transferred to her account.
"After paying for her son's medical expenses and the necessary medication, she used the remaining funds to buy a vehicle, electrical appliances and household expenses", the indictment states.
She admitted that she could not use her son's money for her own needs.
She defended herself by saying that she had helped them pay the family expenses.
"We had trouble with our incomes to tighten the household.
We never bought anything over the top.
It was always for things that my son would approve of.
I thought it was family money.
I had no idea that I was committing a crime", the woman explained to the police.
She promised to return the money to her son.
North America has been inhabited for 30,000 years, scientists say after finding tools
The finds from the Chiquihuite Cave in the Mexican state of Zacatecas include some 1,300 limestone tools, including fine blades that may have been used to cut meat, and pointed objects that may have served as spearheads or spears.
Scientists have found that the oldest of the instruments date back to 33,000 to 31,000 years ago.
"There are only a few products of this age.
But they are", said archaeologist Ciprian Ardelean of the University of Zacatecas and lead author of one of two studies published in the journal Nature.
The youngest instruments are 12,500 years old.
Experts say that the people of the Chiquihuite Cave, located at a great height above sea level, have been living there for a long time, 20,000 years.
The theory that has been widely accepted so far is that the first Homo sapiens crossed the land bridge from what is now Russia to Alaska about 13,500 years ago.
Archaeological evidence, including unique spearheads used to kill mammoths and other prehistoric animals, showed that this hominid culture subsequently spread over much of North America.
But this model has been cracked in recent decades when several ancient settlements were discovered that were two to three thousand years older.
A second study published in the journal Nature reports on 42 different sites across North America that prove human presence on the continent as early as 26,000 to 19,000 years ago.
Scientists believe that a small number of people may have arrived on the North American mainland earlier than previously thought.
Some were able to get to America by boat.
"It is clear that humans were in America long before the development of so-called human culture", said anthropologist Ruth Gruhn of the University of Alberta, Canada, regarding the new findings.
Interest in tickets so far is filling the bullish scenario, the sellers say.
Prices are also gradually falling
Tickets in the Czech Republic are increasing every week.
Interest is still about half of last summer's, but demand is growing by as much as 20 percent each week.
The developments since the crisis thus fulfil the most optimistic scenarios according to the sellers.
The prices of air tickets are also gradually falling.
The most sought-after destinations, according to the sellers, are in particular the southern European countries.
According to Kiwi.com, Spain, Italy and Greece are leading.
The most sold flights are to Split, Croatia.
Of the other countries, the United Kingdom is the most sought-after, but it has always been one of the most heavily trafficked.
The average price of airfares is also falling.
At the portal Letuška.cz, around halfway through the month, around 6250 CZK was moving, 3000 CZK less year-on-year.
This is mainly due to the increased demand for European destinations, which now account for around 85% of sales.
However, prices are falling in some European countries, such as Spain and Italy, where they have fallen by about a fifth in recent weeks.
The crisis has also affected the behaviour of customers, who now buy tickets much less in advance than before, fearing further developments in the coronavirus situation.
According to previous information from Kiwi.com, the time taken to buy a ticket before departure has decreased by approximately 10 days year-on-year.
"We are seeing a future trend where people will be ordering tickets much less in advance, demanding more flexibility, taking less risk", said Michal Šindelář, vice president of products at Kiwi.com.
Currently, the average time to book before departure is 21 days.
The number of airlines renewing flights from the Czech Republic is also increasing alongside the increase in sales.
Prague Airport currently operates scheduled services to more than 60 destinations.
Compared to last summer, this is about half the number of destinations.
The big finals are tonight!
Watch the battle of the arrows live on Nova Sport
The second most prestigious tournament in the PDC organization has reached the grand final.
It will feature the experienced, 94-year-old Scottish archer Gary Anderson and the surprise of the tournament, 26-year-old Belgian Dimitri van den Bergh.
Gary Anderson knocked out Justin Pip in the first round, then bumped into his neighbor in the leaderboard.
But he also managed to take on James Wade, and in the quarterfinals he graciously challenged Simon Whitlock, who had previously sent home the world number one.
"The Flying Scot" had a shot in the semi-finals against Michael Smith.
At the last minute, however, he escaped the shovel, dominated in the prolongation and after the result of 18:16 he won a place in the final of the tournament, which he controlled already in 2018, when he defeated Mensur Suljović 21:19 in an amazing battle.
The biggest surprise of World Matchplay is Dimitri van den Bergh.
The Belgian talent is enjoying the tournament and perhaps the very knowledge that he has nothing to lose has helped him to play on a totally fantastic wave.
The 26-year-old archer first knocked out world number six Nathan Aspinall, then overpowered Joe Cullen in a dramatic battle, and then, after a sharp start, overtook Adrian Lewis in the quarterfinals.
The big test was the semifinals.
Glen Durrant showed his strength at the start, but the calm Belgian then took the lead with a great series, which he then held more or less without problems until the end.
Van den Bergh showed his strength in high scoring, which he used to hit the occasional uncertainty in doubles.
Coronavirus cases have risen since at least the beginning of the week, testing has decreased
Since the beginning of March, when the new coronavirus was first discovered in the Czech Republic, 15,212 people have been infected with it.
Almost 9,600 of them have been cured, 368 of them have died.
Currently, there are 5,254 people with the disease.
It's based on data from the Department of Health's website.
The daily number of newly confirmed cases has surpassed 200 four times this week.
The high was 281 on Friday.
On Thursday, there were 235 positive tests, 246 the day before and 206 on Tuesday.
On the first working day of this week, 169 new cases have been reported.
In the Czech Republic, 9,590 people have been cured of covid-19, or 63 percent of all those infected so far.
Most of them had a mild course.
According to the latest data from the Ministry of Health, there are 151 people in the hospital with coronavirus, 19 of whom are considered to be in serious condition.
There are several outbreaks of covid-19 in the Czech Republic.
The highest number of infections in the last seven days per 100,000 population is still in Karvinsk, with almost 59.
Next up is Jihlava with 56 and Frydeko-Mijstecko with 36 infections per 100,000 inhabitants in the last week.
Due to the increased number of infected people, new measures against the spread of the coronavirus are in force in the Czech Republic since Saturday.
People have to wear headscarves at indoor mass events of over 100 people, cultural and sporting events, but also weddings and funerals inside buildings.
Starting Monday, the capacity of these events will be reduced from the current thousand people to half.
The number of people worldwide who have been confirmed to have the new coronavirus has already crossed the 16 million mark.
This was reported by Johns Hopkins University in the United States, which tracks the global pandemic.
The death toll from COVID-19 is approaching 645,000, according to the source.
The latest one million cases were added to the statistics in just three days; the 15 million mark fell on July 22.
The United States, which has recorded more than 4.1 million cases, Brazil with 2.4 million and India, where nearly 1.4 million people have been infected, were the countries with the largest share of the rapid increase in cases in recent days.
The number of infected is now increasing at a record rate.
The World Health Organization announced this week that more than 284,000 new cases were reported worldwide from Thursday to Friday, the highest daily total since the pandemic began.
This development can be attributed to the fact that the spread of the disease is at its peak in populous countries such as the United States, Brazil and India, according to Reuters, but the number of new cases has increased in the past week in almost 40 countries around the world.
This includes Australia, Japan, Bolivia, Sudan, Bulgaria, Belgium and Israel.
The disease has now spread to almost every country in the world, with the first case officially reported today in the DPRK.
The air inside the home is up to five times worse than outside.
Air fresheners and deodorants are bad for your health
Poor air quality is a health threat not only in the outdoors but also in the home.
This was pointed out by Israeli health expert Carol Abraham, quoted in The Jerusalem Post.
According to Abraham, who helped create Israel's Ministry of the Environment, household pollutants need to be addressed now that many people are spending more time working from home.
Abraham mentioned research by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) that found indoor air quality to be up to five times worse than outdoor air quality.
The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that 3.8 million people die prematurely each year because of poor air quality in their homes.
"Because of the coronavirus epidemic that has forced and still forces many to work from home, people are having to spend more hours in their homes than before, so it's time to focus on indoor air quality", said Abraham.
In Israel, she says, "domestic air quality is almost ignored".
The danger may be from things that a person is in regular contact with - paints, air fresheners, disinfectants, deodorants, or pesticides.
"The clothes we regularly wear to the dry cleaners also emit the poisonous gas", said Abraham.
The most vulnerable, she says, are children, elderly household members, and people with respiratory problems.
Otherwise, healthy individuals may begin to suffer from problems such as headaches, fainting, nasal irritation, nosebleeds, vomiting, or skin allergies.
Long-term exposure to unhealthy substances can damage the internal organs and central nervous system.
Not all pollutants come from objects inside the home, but the material from which the house is built can be a source.
Quiz on Václav Havel: How long he spent in prison and what made him write Charter 77
Fuenlabrada came in because of the coronavirus infection in the team about the chance to advance to the top Spanish football league.
The competition authorities cancelled the originally postponed second-round match, which would have allowed the team to secure a place in the play-offs.
Fuenlabrada reported 12 more people infected on Saturday, bringing the total number of positive COVID-19 tests at the club to 28.
Due to the team's infection, Monday's match against La Coruña was postponed, in which Fuenlabrada scored just one point to advance to the play-offs.
The competition authorities today stated that the duel against La Coruña has been definitively called off in respect of the higher power, as it has never been played again.
Fuenlabrada has made her decision.
La Coruña is rioting against the lack of a match.
In the end, given the results of their rivals, even a victory over Fuenlabrada would not have been enough to save them, but it considers it unfair that the final round was not played as usual, complete in a single time.
The management of a former Spanish elite club is facing a court order for relegation to the third tier.
The first two teams in the table, Huesca and Cádiz, are the ones with the certainty of progress among the elite.
The remaining third place play-offs will be between Zaragoza, Almería, Girona and Elche.
Didn't Karel Gott like Václav Havel? He was a good man.
Dominica's daughter found out.
"Dad hasn't had it for years", she told Ah! the oldest daughter of Gotha Dominica, "and that Master Havel couldn't think of a name, and whenever he was mentioned, it always made Karl angry".
It's hard to say what they did, but according to Dominica, the dispute started sometime in the mid-90s.
"My father wrote in an article after the revolution that he had it easier than he did.
That Havel could have written in a drawer in the dark, but if he had resisted, his career would have been over,' Gott claims.
But he adds that the Czech giants eventually found their way back to each other.
"I know that the word Havel was never heard until he was 60.
Then the president sent him a birthday card, and suddenly my father's relationship with him began to change", recalls Dominica.
Ten years later, Gott even invited the then-president to a celebration of his 70th birthday at the Ambassador Hotel on Wenceslas Square.
"And there began a new era in their relationship, because then my dad would regularly invite Mr. Havel to his home in Bertramck", added the blonde, whose father died last October.
Slavíka also regretted that he had never received a state award from Václav Havel.
However, he was only expected to succeed him in 2009, even though it was already in the hands of his successor as Václav Klaus (79).
He will receive further honours in memoriam, as current President Miloš Zeman (75) is to award him the Order of the White Lion to honour his memory.
Hot weather threatens the Czech Republic, meteorologists warn of fires
The weather forecast for high temperatures applies for Tuesday afternoon for the whole of the Czech Republic except for the Karlovy Vary region and also for southern and central Moravia.
"Exceptionally, temperatures can exceed 34 degrees Celsius, especially in central Bohemia", they report.
People are advised to follow a hot-drinking diet and to limit physical activity during the noon and afternoon hours.
Due to the warm weather with minimal rainfall, there will be a danger of fire starting Tuesday morning.
Windy weather could contribute to their rapid spread.
The meteorological warning of the fire risk concerns the central Bohemian region, including Prague, the Liberec, the Ústeck, the Karlovy Vary and the Pilsen regions.
The fire warning will remain in effect until further notice.
"We do not expect more significant precipitation to mitigate the danger in the northwest and west of Bohemia until at least the end of the week", states the CHMÚ.
The Prague Municipality responded to the warning of meteorologists by banning the spread of fires in risky areas, which is due to take effect from Tuesday.
People in the capital will not be allowed to set fires in parks, gardens or forests, for example, up to 50 meters from the edge of the forest.
Smoking and the use of pyrotechnics are also prohibited in these places.
The measure will remain in force until an appeal is lodged, Prague Magistrates' spokesman Vít Hofman said.
