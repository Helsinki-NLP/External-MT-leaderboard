FANO Russia will hold final Expert Session
The Federal Agency of Scientific Organizations (FANO of Russia) together with the Russian Academy of Sciences will hold the third Expert Session "Evaluation of the effectiveness of the activities of scientific organizations".
The meeting will be the final in a series of meetings held by the agency over the course of the year, according to the press release received by the edition of "Lenty.Ru".
At the third meeting, it is planned to summarize the work of the Expert Session for the year and form a final list of indicators for evaluating the performance of scientific organizations.
Separately, the participants of the event plan to discuss the rules of formation of expert groups responsible for conducting evaluation of the work of scientific groups, and the criteria for conducting evaluations.
The third expert session will be the final event in a series of events on the formation of a single approach for all three academies to the methodology of assessing the performance of the activities of scientific organizations.
Over the past five months, we have succeeded in doing so, and the final version of the regulatory documents is on agreement.
According to the results of the next session, we must complete the formation of the processes of scientific and expert analysis, agree on the stages and terms of the evaluation", - said the head of the expert and analytical department of FANO Russia Elena Aksenova.
More than 100 scientific institutions of Russia will participate in the event.
The resolution is expected to be adopted.
The meeting will begin at 10 a.m. Moscow time on September 16, 2014 at the address: Moscow City, Solyanka Street, house 14.
Scientists have found a way to detect related stars
Astrophysicists from the University of California in Santa Cruz have studied turbulent mixing and its effect on chemical homogeneity in star clusters.
It is expected that the discovery of specialists will allow to look for among the stars related, that is, arising from the same cluster.
The authors published the results of their research in the journal Nature, and they can be briefly read on the website of the university.
The reason for the identical chemical composition of the nearest stars is the turbulent mixing in gas clouds that precedes the formation of stars.
Even if a born star then leaves the star cluster, its chemical composition can determine the place of birth and the region of formation of relatives.
Previously, scientists had doubts that the evolution of a star outside the cluster could lead to differences in its chemical content from that of relatives in the cluster.
Simulation results conducted by astrophysicists show that such differences should not appear.
In their study, scientists used a supercomputer to simulate two interstellar gas streams that together formed a cloud.
This object for several million years under the action of its own gravity is transformed into a cluster in which protostars begin to form.
The scientists added labels to the original gas flows and found that a high degree of chemical homogeneity was achieved due to rapid turbulent mixing in the cloud.
According to astrophysicists, their research proves that it is possible to look for relatives of stars by chemical composition, as well as to identify possible regions of formation of such objects.
Karata police arrested a 20-year-old after chasing a motorcycle at high speed
The motorcycle was confiscated after driving at a speed of 125 km/h in the speed limit zone of 70 km/h and across the bushland to escape police in Pilbar.

Judge Lady Ray has scheduled a hearing at the High Court in Edinburgh for November 17.
Lavrov: Russia will not knock on the door in connection with new sanctions and will not withdraw from the WTO
Russia will not knock on the door in connection with new sanctions.
This was stated today by the head of the Russian Foreign Ministry Sergey Lavrov, speaking before students and teachers of MGIMO.
Regarding our response measures in the event of a new wave of anti-Russian sanctions, I will not even reason, fantasy, because everything has to be specifically calculated, - he said.
And when we understand what our European and American partners will like this time, then we will decide how to respond to it.
This will not be related to knocking on the door, some offenses, misunderstood, - stressed the minister.
We will, first of all, push ourselves away from our interests, interests in protecting our economy, social sphere, our citizens, our business and draw conclusions from the actions of our partners on their adequacy, contractual capacity and reliability.
By the steps that are taken in the field of sanctions, you can very well judge what the partners are seeking, - continued the head of the Russian Foreign Ministry.
If they say in full voice that "they sanctions will also be painful for us, but we are forced to do so to punish Russia," it is probably not very adequate.
As for the WTO withdrawal of the Russian Federation in response to possible new sanctions, no.
We, on the contrary, want to more actively master the WTO tools, including when it comes to trade disputes,” Lavrov said.
We have already used this toolkit to overcome the EU’s discriminatory anti-dumping policy.
According to the minister, Russia is accused of dumping and anti-dumping measures are being applied against the sectors of the Russian economy.
“We are ready to use the WTO mechanisms in order to defend our position on the inadmissibility of applying the rules of the EU’s third energy package retrospectively,” Lavrov said.
How to use sirens in garden design?
Irina Okuneva responds to questions:
Since the sirene after flowering loses its main attractiveness, it is desirable to plant it together with other shrubs.
It combines well with many cultures.
And next to the siren you can and need to plant both plants, decorative at other times, and blooming at the same time with it.
Another plus of the sirene is that it provides a lot of opportunities for creativity.
You can form it with a stem tree of different heights, an improved bush, a bush with a wide foundation and even the resemblance of a garden bonsai - a tree with a bizarrely curved trunk.
Just choose the shape that matches the design of your garden.
In Karelia for the sale of fake money convicted resident of Leningrad region
According to the Republican Ministry of Internal Affairs, the man was engaged in his criminal fishing in the Olonets and Segezh districts.
In addition to Karelia, he committed similar crimes in other regions of the country.
In particular, the accused has already managed to inherit in the Vologda region, where in the spring of this year he was sentenced to two and a half years in prison.
Later, the man appeared before the Olonets district court.
And for the conclusion of the investigation of crimes committed in our republic, it was staged in Segeza.
The investigation proved guilty in several episodes of the sale of counterfeit money, relating to the summer of 2013.
At the end of June this year, the materials of the criminal case with the indictment were sent to the court.
On Friday, August 29, the court decided to replace the term of imprisonment by four years with serving in a colony of general regime.
The sentence did not come into legal force.
Last week, two other salesmen of fake money, which were paid by them in stores Petrozavodsk, were convicted.
Azerbaijani citizens also came to Karelia from St. Petersburg.
One was imprisoned for five years, the other for four.
Each was fined 500 thousand rubles.
The verdict has not yet entered into legal force.
In Arkhangelsk marked the 73rd anniversary of the parish of the first convoy "Dervish"
The rally, which took place in the regional center, was dedicated to the first Arctic convoy.
Dervis delivered military aid from the United States and Great Britain to the USSR.
In Arkhangelsk, a commemoration rally took place at the foundation stone of the future monument to the participants of the northern convoys, which is located on the Sedov coastline in Solombal.
At the event gathered representatives of the veteran organizations of Arkhangelsk, children from the cadet class.
We met for the first time twenty-three years ago when the stone was laid.
But at the same time, today’s event is not a holiday, but a day of remembrance for those who have not been returned by the sea,” said Boris Karpov, Chairman of the Council of Veterans of the Northern Maritime Steam Shipping.
Then the city spirit orchestra performed at the event, and the students of the cadet classes gave flowers to the veterans and marched with the Russian flags and the flag of Victory.
The meeting ended with the laying of flowers on the stone.
The convoy itself consisted of five English vessels and one Dutch transport, loaded with strategically important raw materials (10,000 tons of rubber, 1,500 tons of shaped shoes, lead, wool, and many other inventories and equipment).
In addition, on board the ships was military equipment and weapons - 3,800 depth bombs and magnetic mines, fifteen fighters "Harrikein", in dismantled condition.
The convoy was escorted by 16 ships of the British Navy, including two aircraft carriers.
The caravan of the vessels was not detected by the enemy and safely reached the destination - Arkhangelsk.
Of the 848 ships involved in the crucial caravan operations, 126 transport and about 50 military vessels were killed.

Remembering the very American ideal that labor rights are human rights
Congressmen Keith Ellison and John Lewis have proposed a bill that would protect trade unions as a civil law.
“Where trade unions are, there are middle-class jobs,” says Allison, a Democrat from Minnesota who is a congressional co-chair of the Progressive Faction.
That’s why I’m proud to present the Workers’ Rights Expansion Act along with the civil rights movement symbol John Lewis.
This groundbreaking bill will give employees the same legal opportunities when discriminating against trade unions as in other forms of discrimination, stopping the forces of opponents of trade unions.
Changing the Labour Relations Regulation Act in such a way as to allow workers facing discrimination for participating in trade unions to seek justice in civil courts – and to receive damages and fines – is a reasonable and necessary initiative.
However, this is undoubtedly not a radical initiative – at least according to American standards.
In fact, the best way to figure out what Allison, Lewis and the co-authors of the bill are offering is to recall a very American idea.
Despite the attacks facing trade unions in recent years — in Wisconsin, Michigan and other states across the country — Americans once supported countries around the world in adopting, expanding and respecting labor rights.
There was a time that millions of Americans still remember when this country simultaneously defended democracy, freedom of speech, freedom of the press and the right to organize.
When the United States occupied Japan after World War II, General Douglas McArthur and his assistants helped the country adopt a constitution designed to ensure that the militant autocracy of Hideki Tojo was replaced by democracy.
Fully aware that workers and their trade unions play a role in shaping the new Japan, they included a text that explicitly acknowledged that “the right of workers to organize, and to negotiate, and to collective action is guaranteed.”
When the United States occupied Germany after World War II, General Dwight David Eisenhower and his assistants helped the Germans write a constitution that guaranteed that Adolf Hitler's fascism was replaced by a strong democracy.
Recognizing that workers would need to organize and be heard in the new state, the Germans included an article which openly stated: "The right to form associations in order to protect and improve labor and economic conditions will be guaranteed to every person and every profession or sphere of activity.
Agreements which restrict or seek to prejudice this right shall not have legal force; measures aimed at these purposes shall be deemed unlawful.
When former First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt was chairman of the International Commission on Human Rights, which drafted the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which was to be adopted by the United Nations in 1948 as a global agreement, Roosevelt and its authors included a guarantee that “everyone has the right to organize and join unions to defend their interests.”
For generations, Americans have taken the basic position that labor rights are human rights.
When this country advised other countries on how to create civil and democratic societies, Americans explained that the right to organize trade unions – and that the trade union should participate as an equal partner in collective bargaining with corporations and government agencies – should be protected.
Now that these rights are being attacked in America, it is wise, indeed, to return to the American ideal that working people should have the right to organize and to have their voices heard in a free and open society.
As St. Martin Luther King said 50 years ago:
History is a great teacher.
Now everyone knows that the trade union movement has not undermined the strength of the nation, but has increased it.
By raising the standard of living of millions, the trade unions miraculously created a market for industry and lifted the whole nation to an unimaginable level of production.
Those who attack trade unions forget these simple truths, but history remembers them.
History remembers as we should.
The official recognition of labor rights as human rights – and the expansion of civil rights protection to prevent discrimination against trade unions – has long been obsolete.
Keith Ellison and John Lewis revive the ideals that historically expanded America and made the promise of democracy a reality.
A judge temporarily blocks a law that could close all abortion clinics in Louisiana
In the United States, a federal judge on Sunday temporarily blocked the implementation of the Louisiana law, which supporters say is likely to close all five abortion clinics in the state.
Under this measure, which was signed for enforcement by Louisiana Governor Bobby Ginnald in June and was to come into force on September 1, doctors who do abortions would be required to have authorization to receive patients in hospitals within a radius of 30 miles from their practice.
However, the judge’s decision means that at the moment doctors can continue to do legal abortions while continuing to seek such authority.
"The plaintiffs will be allowed to work legally while continuing the proceedings to obtain authority," Judge John DeGravels wrote in his decision.
The hearing will be appointed within a month, during which the judge will make a more permanent decision on this law.
Defenders of the right to abortion welcomed this decision, the latest in a series of decisions against similar measures, saying it would give doctors more time to obtain hospital authorities.
“Today’s decision ensures that Louisiana women will be protected from a false law that seeks to deprive them of their health and rights,” said Nancy Northup, president and head of the Center for Reproductive Rights, who filed a lawsuit on behalf of three of the state’s five clinics.
It was not immediately obvious whether the decision applied to doctors from two clinics who did not act as plaintiffs in this case and also filed for authorization for admission.
Louisiana is one of 11 states that have passed similar laws, and courts recently recognized such measures as unconstitutional in Alabama and Mississippi.
Key parts of the Texas law, which would close most of the remaining clinics in the state, were blocked by a federal judge on Friday.
Fighters for the right to abortion, along with the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the American Medical Association, say admissions laws impose restrictions on doctors that are not necessary from a medical standpoint.
Opponents of abortion argue that such measures are aimed at protecting women’s health, although some have also noted their positive effect in closing clinics.
Only one doctor who performs abortions in Louisiana has authority for hospital admission, the Reproductive Rights Center said.
If all other doctors in the state were forced to stop doing this procedure, this doctor, fearing for his safety, would stop doing it, the group said.
Criticising the decision, Louisiana officials said they would not punish doctors who do abortions as long as their applications for admission authority are awaiting a decision.
The introduction of quotas for domestic products
At least half of the products for each type of goods in the range of retail chains should be of Russian production, says Deputy of the State Duma from the "Fair Russia" faction Oleg Nilov.
Parliamentary prepared a bill aimed at introducing protective measures against domestic producers, writes the newspaper "Izvestia".
The document will still be detailed to avoid possible discomfort for buyers.
For the other groups of products that are produced in Russia, the retailer will have to provide at least half of its shelves to domestic manufacturers," Nilov told the publication.
Together with amendments to the article "On the foundations of state regulation of trade activities in the Russian Federation" the bill provides for amendments to the Tax Code, establishing a reduced VAT rate of 10% when selling products manufactured in Russia.
The idea of introducing a 50% quota in retail chains is part of a package of incentive measures for Russian producers.
There will be several times more domestic goods on the shelves.
However, the initiative can have both positive and negative effects, experts say.
According to the lawyer of the company "Taxovik", a member of the independent expert center "Government Duma" Sergey Litvinenko, for the Russian economy, as well as for the domestic agricultural and food industries, the effect will be positive, and will lead to growth.
Plus will be farmers, farmers, small shops.
They will be able to sell more, which means that the profit will grow.
In addition, they will get the right to dictate their terms and prices to retailers, because they will be forced to buy their goods.
Russian manufacturers will be able to increase their operations and sales, which will lead to higher taxes than before.
This will increase budget revenues, create new jobs, some industries will begin to expand, some will learn faster, will contribute to GDP growth.
Russia’s dependence on foreign food will decrease several times, but not immediately,” the expert said.
Previously, Russian enterprises often could not break into the shelves of local stores due to high competition from foreign counterparts.
Now, after the embargo was introduced, this niche has been released and you can breathe with relief.
But it should not be forgotten that after all the necessary agreements and sanitary inspections, food products from Latin America, Turkey and Serbia will enter the Russian market.
In other words, now comes the "moment of silence", when the former players have already left, and the new ones have not yet arrived.
Almost a month later, we can talk about increased demand for domestic raw materials, as well as rising prices for finished products,” said the first vice president of the All-Russian public organization “Russian Club of Financial Directors”, K.E.N. Tamara Kasyanova.
The idea of selling at least 50% of Russian food goods in each category will allow the sector to be fixed on local producers.
In this case, they will compete with each other, and not with goods that are cheaper at the expense of subsidies from another state.
In other words, the battle for the buyer will unfold between companies operating under uniform laws of the industry.
On the other hand, Kasyanova notes, Russian manufacturers are able to meet 50% of the domestic needs of compatriots far from all articles.
And in this situation, the retail chains will have to "reach" the share of Russian goods to half the range.
In this regard, there are growing fears that low-quality goods will arrive on the shelves.
Per under the guise of Russian products will be supplied foreign products with broken labels", - adds the expert.
The negative effect of the introduction of quotas will be felt by large trading networks, especially those that are more profitable to cooperate with importers.
It is logical that with this arrangement, foreign suppliers themselves will suffer because the demand for their products will decrease.
Litvinenko does not rule out that the law on quotas for domestic goods may affect consumers as well.
The fact is that some products of Russian production may be inferior in quality to imported analogues, while stores will be able to raise prices for the latter, as for a deficient product.
The idea of import substitution, which was forgotten in the early 2000s, was again discussed by economists in February of this year due to the continued devaluation of the ruble.
Now, against the backdrop of difficult relations with the West, the issue of refusing imported products is becoming even more relevant.
The law is intended to obligate retailers when forming orders to suppliers to count with domestic producers.
Then we will go much faster and more confidently on the path of import substitution, and the system of production planning for the necessary types of products will be created in a shorter time," says Deputy Oleg Nilov.
The quota mechanism will be especially effective for those agricultural sectors where the potential is high, for example, in the dairy industry, where the share of imports was 25%.
Our farmers are really able to fully cover the shelves of Russian stores.
Meat production can also get a strong impetus.
As is known, the largest share of imports is retained by beef - from 30% to 35%.
It turns out, 65-70% still falls on Russian products", - explains Kasyanova.
Experts are of the opinion that the introduction of quotas on domestic products will promote import substitution and can speed up this process.
However, in itself, this initiative will not lead to import substitution, as this requires a set of measures, Litvinenko is confident.
In any case, 50% of the goods sold under this initiative can still be brought from abroad, which means that a full-fledged import substitution will not occur, but significant steps in this direction will be made.
In addition, it is not enough to establish quotas, it is still necessary to set up domestic production in the country in order to meet these quotas.
These quotas will provide such guarantees,” the expert says.
Late diagnosis and lack of access to optimal treatment mean that ovarian cancer in rural areas kills more
Angelina Jolie and her brother James published a video of the memory of their late mother, who died of ovarian cancer in 2007.
Women who forgive in rural Australia face a higher risk of dying from ovarian cancer than those living in cities.
Researchers analyzed disease maps of more than 1,100 Australian women diagnosed with ovarian cancer in 2005, finding that only 35 percent lived five years after the diagnosis was made.
Lead researcher Susan Jordan of the QIMR Institute for Medical Research Berghofer that the likelihood of dying during the study was 20 percent higher in those living in regions and remote areas of the state than in those living in urban areas.
Small Study: New Drugs May Slow Lung Cancer and Ovarian Cancer
The researchers followed the medical path of women over seven years.
Dr. Jordan said that the age of the woman at the time of diagnosis, the type of ovarian cancer, the presence of current diseases and socioeconomic status also influenced the likelihood of survival.
Older women and those who had cancer at a later stage at the time of diagnosis had the lowest survival rates.
For those who lived in regions or remote areas of the state, the likelihood of dying during the study was 20 percent higher than for those who lived in urban areas.
Although the study was not intended to determine why women living outside cities were more likely to die from ovarian cancer, Dr. Jordan suggested that untimely diagnosis and lack of access to optimal treatment were possible factors.
“This disease is best treated by surgeons specializing in gynecological oncology, and they are mainly located in large cities,” she said.
Despite improving the quality of telemedicine services to reduce the impact of distance, she suggested that increasing the number of services at departure, which will allow professionals to treat women closer to home, and support programs for people undergoing treatment away from their home, could help.
Dr. Jordan said that regardless of geographical location, the study found that longer life expectancy among women with ovarian cancer was rare, highlighting the need for more effective treatment and prevention strategies.
The study, funded by Rio Tinto Ride to Conquer cancer, will be published today in the Medical Journal of Australia.
In March 2012, at the age of 33, a young mother from Gold Coast, Elisha Nive, was told she had an aggressive form of ovarian cancer.
In September, a new FAP will open its doors in the Kuzhener district
Construction of the medical facility in the village of Toktaybalak was started in April of this year and was carried out according to a standard project.
The cost of the work was just over 10 million rubles.
According to the Department of Public Relations and Information of the Head Mari El, the financing of the construction of the facility was carried out at the expense of the republican budget in accordance with the targeted investment program.
The total area of the built medical and preventive facility is almost 230 square meters.
Here, medical care will be provided to the inhabitants of eight settlements: the villages of Toktaybalak and the villages of Dementiyevo, Püncheryumal, Tunja, Fomichi, Torajbalak, Shinur and Chashkal.
The new maternity post will replace the current FAP, the building of which was built in 1918 and has long exhausted its resources, and its premises do not meet sanitary and hygienic requirements.
The new facility will open soon.
The murder of a four-month-old son in a drunk state of novocheboksarka will appear before the court
A resident of Chuvashia will be on the bench of accused for the murder of her own child.
The investigation of a criminal case against a 31-year-old resident of Novocheboksarsk, accused of causing death by negligence, has been completed.
The investigation established that on July 26, this year, the accused along with her four-month-old son came to celebrate the birthday of the child of her cousin in Cheboksar.
After a long feast, the novocheboksarka decided to stay in the guests and put the child to sleep.
When the baby woke up at night and cried, a drunk woman laid him next to her on the bed to breastfeed, but soon fell asleep.
During the sleep, the woman stumbled on the son, as a result of which he died of suffocation.
The criminal case, reports the press service of the SU SCR on Chuvashia, is sent to court.
Inflation is on vacation.
The Russians are feeling a sharp price rise.
As a result of cross-sanctions between the Russian Federation and the West, inflation in Russia will accelerate and will not fit the forecasts of the authorities, analysts of VTB Capital are convinced.
According to experts, the postponed effects of anti-sanctions will lead to an inflation shock in the first quarter of 2015, reports RBC Daily.
According to the latest forecast of the Ministry of Economic Development, in 2014 inflation will be 6.5-7,5%, next year and less - 6.5%.
However, according to the newspaper "Kommersant", this week the mayor should make "small but fundamental" adjustments to the macroeconomic forecast until 2017.
According to the publication, the agency may lower its estimate of inflation for 2015, which will eliminate the expected zero growth in population incomes.
In the forecast, it was assumed that the food sanctions of the Russian Federation are in effect for one year - until August 2015.
How could such a high inflation be expected?
The current situation presupposes a one-time shock, but the downward trend of inflation will not change," the newspaper's source in the Ministry of Finance said.
Economists from VTB Capital do not share the expectations of the government’s financial and economic bloc regarding inflation and forecast price growth in 2014 at the level of 8%.
The main effect of food bans will come along with the possible introduction in the regions of the Russian Federation of sales tax (NSP) in 2015, experts are convinced.
Inflation peak of 9% will occur in February, after which the annual rate of price growth will go down, experts believe.
By the way, last week, Rosstat summed up the first inflationary results after the Russian Federation introduced “strict sanctions”.
AIF.ru interviewed experts and found out their inflation expectations.
Artem Deev, head of the analytical department of FC AForex:
Prices have increased in the main commodity segments.
Moreover, when socially significant products rose, the government was forced to launch systemic monitoring of price stability to prevent the risks of unreasonable price increases in the short term.
Suppliers and retailers are already reporting on a daily basis to regulators so that authorities know exactly who, when and for what reason initiates price increases.
The key factors for the growth of the consumer price index continue to be colossal capital outflows, excessive refinancing of the banking sector by the Russian megaregulator, internal conversion due to the flight of the population into foreign currency, as well as an embargo on the import of food products from countries that have joined the sanctions against Russia.
If inflationary pressures remained under control, the cost of a basket of the minimum set of products would not jump by 12% in a single quarter.
The ban on the import of food products provoked a supply shock in the domestic market and led to a completely logical increase in the final value.
Since at the current stage we are unable to fully launch the mechanism of import substitution, as well as to increase the self-sufficiency of the Russian market at the expense of domestic production, retaliatory sanctions will continue to bear risks of inflationary growth.
If you add to this fiscal reasons related to the lack of confidence in the national currency, as well as worsened economic growth prospects, by the end of this year, inflation may well exceed 8%.
Alexander Razuvayev, director of the analytical department "Alpari"
In the 1990s, inflation sometimes reached 20-30% per month, at zero it was also above the current level, another thing is that then it was compensated by rapid economic growth.
I think that by the end of the year the inflation will be 8-8,5%.
Plato Maguta, managing assets of the UK "Maguta Fund"
The external factor associated with the sanctions against Russia has so far been successfully curbed, but if there is a further increase in pressure, first of all, on the financial sector - this can lead to certain difficulties and increase the inflationary expectations of the population, which are usually expressed in cash purchases in order to secure their savings.
It can be assumed that the government, the Central Bank of the Russian Federation and the Ministry of Finance will try to mitigate the smooth weakening of the ruble, both by market methods and by state regulation.
But the rise in prices traditionally begins after the summer calm and may become more tangible this autumn.
The target level of consumer inflation in Russia at 7.5%, most likely, stands, as the Russian Federation still has financial savings.
Gardeners are saddened by the decline in the number of homeowners
This drop, driven by an exceptional decline in the number of homeowners under the age of 35, could lead to gardening centers starting to lose tens of millions of pounds a year when today’s young consumers reach the “basic age of gardening,” according to a HTA study by the Financial Times.
According to this report, people who rent houses spend on average 55 percent of the amount owners spend on gardening.
It mentions the increase in the number of people living in highly urban areas without gardens, the popularity of paving courtyards in front of a house for parking, and the reduction in the size of the garden as other factors threatening the industry, whose annual sales are estimated at £5 billion.
In Greater London, where the number of homeowners dropped from 61 percent to 43 percent in six years, the UK’s lowest level of spending on gardener goods per household.
HTA and the Royal Horticultural Society that renting housing and the lack of garden space do not mean that people can’t grow plants.
Guy Barter, chief gardening adviser at RHS, said: “Cultivating plants in containers, for example, is especially popular with tenants who can carry plants with them when they move.”
The HTA report identified the period between 1997 and 2005 as the "golden age" of horticultural retail as a result of increased homeowners and economic prosperity from the late 1980s to the mid-1990s.
It also predicts that the market will improve this year due to better weather after adverse conditions in March and April last year.
The Ministry of Agriculture of Bulgaria carried out a mass cleansing in the Fund "Agriculture"
Three of the four heads of the Fund "Agriculture" were replaced on Friday.
In total, three of the four heads of the Fund “Agriculture” were replaced on Friday.
Officially, the Bulgarian Ministry of Agriculture only announced the removal of the executive director Atanas Dobrev.
His place was taken by Lausanne Vasiliev.
It turned out that on Friday two of the three deputy executive directors of the fund were silently replaced.
Deputy Executive Director Tatyana Angelova, who was previously responsible for state aid and the SAPARD program, was released, according to the newspaper "Trad".
I did not attend the board of directors of the fund because we are not members of the board of directors by law, but I was later informed that I was released.
I cannot say why my dismissal is not on the foundation’s website.
I am on vacation.
I hope to find out more on Monday," she told the newspaper Angelova.
Her place will be taken by Ivanka Bagdatova, who has so far been the head of “Investment Credit” in the central fund of “Agriculture” in Sofia.
Deputy Executive Director Nikolai Dachev was also released.
Until then, he was responsible for direct subsidies for fields paid by the EU.
In his place will be appointed Zhivko Zhivkov, who was the head of the regional directorate of the fund "Agriculture" in the city of Veliko Tirnovo until January 2014.
The position was retained only by the Deputy Head of the Fund Attige Aliyeva-Veli.
It is currently responsible for the Rural Development Programme.
The official reasons for all the changes in the department are not mentioned.
Turkey calls out U.S. diplomat over spying allegations
The Turkish Foreign Ministry has summoned the highest-ranking American diplomat in the country for clarification in connection with a report on American and British espionage in Turkey.
Deputy Prime Minister Bulent said the U.S. commissioner and Turkish officials discussed the announcement on Monday.
The German magazine Der Spiegel and the online magazine The Intercept that documents provided by former U.S. National Security Agency analyst Edward Snowden show that Turkey was a priority intelligence target for U.S. and British intelligence services.
According to Turkish news agencies, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan underestimated the importance of the report, saying that all the leading countries are spying on each other.
Previously reports that Germany’s main intelligence agency has also made Ankara an intelligence target have sparked a more angry response from the Turkish government.
The largest Chinese companies unite against Alibaba
Chinese companies, including China’s largest commercial real estate developer Dalian Wanda Group and Internet giants Tencent Holdings (social networks, messengers, etc.) and Baidu (the largest Chinese search engine), are creating a company that will compete in the online trading market with Alibaba.
However, to catch up with the miracle of the Chinese Internet, which has left behind even its American rivals - eBay and Amazon.com, will not be easy.
Union of the largest
The two companies plan to invest 5 billion yuan ($814 million) in the joint venture, 70% of which will belong to Wanda and 15% to each of the Internet companies, the Wanda Group said in a statement.
The company will be registered in Hong Kong.
SP will combine Baidu’s search services with popular social platform WeChat (China’s largest social network with about 438 million users), Tencent and Wanda infrastructure.
In addition to a network of 40 fashionable hotels, Wanda Group operates at least 49 commercial real estate facilities across China and 40 shopping centers.
Last year, the company invested 50 billion yuan ($8 billion) in the construction of a film studio and theme park in Qingdao (a city in eastern China on the Yellow Sea).
The project is expected to attract more than 1 million visitors annually and generate a profit of $960 million.
In addition, Wanda owns the American network of cinemas AMC Entertainment Holdings, which makes the company the largest operator of cinemas in the world.
By 2015, Wanda plans to equip all of its own shopping centers, hotels and entertainment venues with e-commerce services, which will be developed by the competitor Alibaba.
According to Dun Ce, who will lead the new company, thanks to the merger Wanda will be able to increase the number of users of its e-commerce services from the current 40 million people to 100 million by next year.
The new platform is expected to become the world’s largest online-to-offline platform, says Dun Zi.
The essence of online-to-offline (O2O) commerce is to attract online buyers to come to regular offline stores or buy other traditional services.
A classic example of O2O are coupons selling services such as Groupon or Vigoda.ru.
"O2O is the biggest "cake" in online commerce," said Wanda chief executive Van Jianglin (cited by Bloomberg).
"Now there is no real O2O platform in China, and in this situation the chances are roughly equal," he believes.
The Chinese online trading market is the largest in the world, and McKinsey & Co. estimates its volume will more than triple by 2015 compared to 2011, to $395 billion.
The number of Chinese internet users has grown to 632 million, according to Bloomberg official statistics: this is more than the population of any country in the world except India.
And according to the forecasts, by 2015 this number could grow to 850 million people.
Union of the Richest
Tencent CEO Ma Huaten was until recently the richest man in China, but according to Bloomberg’s Millionaires Index, Alibaba founder Jack Ma has already surpassed him by $5.5 billion.
Jack Ma’s fortune is estimated at $21.8 billion, of which $11 billion comes from his stake in Alibaba.
Baidu chief Robin Lee now ranks third among the wealthiest people in China, while Wang Jianlin of Wanda is fourth in the ranking.
“It’s very interesting to watch behind this battle: the three richest people are joining forces to challenge the even richer one,” said Bloomberg director of the Chinese e-commerce research center in Hangzhou, Tsao Lee.
But he believes that the new company is unlikely to be able to seriously compete with Alibaba immediately after its creation: "Rome cannot be built in a day."
The fact that it is not so easy to compete with Alibaba not only new companies, but also the well-deserved leaders of the world internet trade, is evidenced by the published report on Alibaba's financial performance for the last quarter.
Alibaba is often described as something of the middle between eBay and Amazon.com, but from April to June the Chinese company earned more than both of its American competitors combined.
Alibaba’s net profit for the period almost doubles the similar summary of competitors – it grew almost three times in annual terms and amounted to $1.99 billion.
“Alibaba still has enormous money-generating potential, largely thanks to its mobile apps,” said an analyst at Hong Kong’s Arete Research Service.
According to the updated prospectus of Alibaba on the website of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, the number of active mobile users of the company's services in July amounted to 188 million, which is significantly higher than the March figure (163 million people).
At the same time, 32.8% of all Alibaba transactions in the last quarter came from mobile devices.
Alibaba will have to name the value of its shares before the IPO.
According to an average estimate of 11 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg, the company could be valued at $187 billion after the sale of shares.
According to Bloomberg sources, Alibaba’s debut on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) may take place on September 16.
The company’s road-show, which precedes this event, starts on September 3.
Alibaba’s IPO is expected to be a record in the history of the NYSE and will allow the company to raise around $20 billion.
Until now, the record for the amount of funds attracted on the US exchanges belonged to the Visa payment system, which in 2008 held the primary placement of its shares, earning $ 17.9 billion.
At least half of food products in retail chains should be of Russian production, according to deputies of the State Duma.
They have drafted a bill on the subject.
Article 8 of the Federal Law “On the Basics of State Regulation of Trade Activities in the Russian Federation” and the Tax Code.
The aim of the document is to introduce protective measures against Russian food producers.
Important clarification, according to the bill, at least 50 percent of products of domestic production in the stores must be for each type of goods.
However, the document will take into account that there are goods that are not produced in Russia, such as vegetables and fruits in the winter, so there will be a "discount" for them to avoid possible discomfort for buyers.
At the same time, the draft law also amends the Tax Code of the Russian Federation, which establishes a reduced VAT rate of 10% for the sale of all food goods, the country of origin of which is Russia.
On August 27, a draft law on amendments to the Federal Law "On Retail Markets" was submitted to the lower house of the parliament, which proposes to revive farmers' markets in Russia, where small producers will be able to sell their products.
Magaluf police chief accused of corruption
The plaintiffs submitted evidence of extortion by police and officials of the municipality of Calvia to the office of the state prosecutor of Mallorca on Friday.
The chief of the Calvia police on the resort island of Mallorca was arrested as a result of allegations of corruption by businessmen and bar owners in the scandalously famous Magaluf drunkenness center.
Chief Inspector José Antonio Navarro has been placed in custody as a result of corruption charges raised against him by several businessmen from Punta Balena, the street where most of Magaluf's bars and nightclubs are located.
According to the daily online magazine Mallorca Diario, the plaintiffs submitted evidence of extortion by police and municipal officials in Calvia to the office of the Malorcan anti-corruption prosecutor on Friday.
Two other local police officers have been arrested by the Spanish National Guard on corruption charges and will be questioned by a judge along with Navarro.
The Spanish daily ABC that dissatisfied nightclub owners say protectionism from the authorities is seriously affecting their business.
“It’s not about making money anymore, it’s about surviving,” one of the businessmen told the court.
We must not jeopardize our sources of existence.
We have nothing to lose.
Magaluf came to the headlines of the international press this summer after a popular YouTube video showing an 18-year-old British vacationer killing 24 men while running in bars.
The authorities of the island have since tried to stop the hooliganism in the drunken state among the holidaymakers of Magaluf, minimizing the number of scandalously famous alcoholic runs in bars.
In addition, the Playhouse club, where the mine incident occurred, was forced to close for a year, while Playhouse and the organizers of the Carnage bar race together were fined €55,000 ($73,000).
The Magalluf tourist resort, mostly popular with young British vacationers, has also been the site of numerous alcoholic accidents associated with the crazy fun known as “balconying” when people jump from one balcony to another or from the balcony to the hotel pool.
The first day of spring is marked by wet and windy conditions that have affected flights at Adelaide Airport
Spring has prepared a cold surprise in southern South Australia, bringing heavy rains and strong winds that have affected flights at Adelaide Airport.
Another 5 mm of rain fell on the city in the evening at 9 p.m., following the 6.6 mm that fell over the night of Sunday.
The last rain was preceded by a couple of short rains with a whirlwind, including a thunderstorm that began shortly before 8 p.m. and poured out 4 mm in about 10 minutes.
After winter gave off the early portion of spring last week, temperatures fell again on Monday to a peak of just 15.8C in the city.
Bad conditions are believed to have been one of the reasons for the delay of the Virgin Airlines flight from Melbourne to Adelaide.
The plane was scheduled to land immediately after 7:30 p.m., but hit the wind shift zone - a sudden change in speed or wind direction on a short distance - and was forced to gain height.
Wind blows reached 50 km/h on the ground at Adelaide Airport at this time.
Flight data showed that the aircraft had to reach a height during the second landing, and the aircraft eventually landed around 8:40 p.m.
The delay caused subsequent delays on several other flights, including Emirates flights from Dubai and Qantas flights from Sydney.
A maximum of 16C is forecast in Adelaide on Tuesday with the likelihood of one or two rains.
The calculation of the estimate of construction facilities in the Russian Federation will take place in a new way
Issues of pricing, regulation of the construction industry, as well as problems of connection to networks the Federal Antimonopoly Service takes on special control.
The FAS established an expert council on the development of competition in the construction sector.
At his meeting, the head of the management of control of housing, construction and natural resources FAS Vadim Soloviev said that "today's calculation of the estimate of construction objects is absolutely incomprehensible."
The regulatory framework makes pricing opaque and can lead to unreasonable construction costs, according to the FAS.
And they propose the cost of construction of state-owned objects at the design stage to be determined on the basis of market prices of constructive solutions instead of the estimated norms and individual pricing for technological operations applied today.
These proposals are included in the road map and are currently being considered in the Ministry of Finance.
“The replacement of traditional estimate documentation in construction with calculations of structural elements should lead to less corruption in the industry,” explained Vadim Soloviev.
After all, now in the estimate each screw and gauge is calculated, and it is not always possible to check everything, so sometimes in the documentation unfair construction companies can bury "whole tractors".
I agree with FAS.
"The first work on the transition to the calculation of value on the constructive elements already exists: methods have been developed for the calculation of prices on the constructive solutions, the preparation of estimates on these indicators," said Elena Zhukova, Head of the Department of Urban Development and Architecture of the Ministry of Construction.
The road construction area was selected as a pilot.
However, experts believe that the problem is much more serious.
As the head of the construction company "Profi-invest" Anatoly Demyanko told "RGB", estimate standards have long been outdated, but another mechanism for business has not yet been proposed.
"As for the proposed calculations on the structural elements, this is difficult to implement in practice, because completely different technologies are often used in the construction of buildings," he said.
It is no secret that the construction market is developed in large part due to the state order.
According to the Chairman of the Board of State Procurement "Expert Community of Public Procurement Professionals" Ekaterina Lezina, today the state is the most solvent customer.
Vladimir Malakhov, deputy director of engineering of Rosatom’s industrial capital construction center, pointed out that today the market is conditionally divided into companies that have access to a portfolio of contracts and companies that possess monopoly competencies and do not allow competitors to enter this field.
He believes that the creation of a transparent market is possible only if access to contracts is protected as far as possible from someone’s governing influence.
At the expert council, it was proposed to form a system of state order in such a way that the same contractor is not entitled to receive more than one contract in the amount of more than 1 billion rubles. or several contracts in the amount of more than 1 billion rubles.
The Ministry of Construction believes that this approach needs to be assessed in terms of the impact on business, as well as the effectiveness of construction management.
As explained by Elena Zhukova, in this case it will be necessary to give the customer the functions of the general contractor, which will lead to an increase in the staff of the customer and budget expenses for its maintenance.
At the same time, the customer’s specialists will need to have the knowledge to assess the quality of the works performed by the contracting organizations, as well as their safety.
Often with such a breakdown, it will be necessary to determine who will be responsible for the safety of the object as a whole.
In addition, this approach can lead to the outflow of highly qualified participants in public procurement in connection with the uninterest in receiving the state order for the incomplete volume of works and the small amount of the contract.
Deputy head of the expert and consulting center of the Institute of Procurement Alexander Yevstašenkov believes that now the procedure of the state order has become a business game on the attention of the contractor.
When filling out the application, the participant must indicate "concrete indicators" without stating the words: "or equivalent", "should be", "from", "more", "less", "analogue", "or", "type", "analogue type", "not lower", "lower", "above", "can have", "may be", "not earlier", "not above", "not allowed" and so on.
Thus, customers often abuse their right to set requirements for the content of applications submitted by contractors.
Another problem of the 44-FZ, according to Evstachenkov, was the need to assess the quality of the work through the "paper" offer of the participant.
Considering the application of the participant, it is really possible to evaluate only the qualification of the contractor, but not the quality of the work, the performance of which has not even started, - believes the expert.
The quality of the work can only be assessed when it is accepted.
The expert council was also suggested to move margin income from the top to the bottom, so that intermediate contractors disappear.
The chairman of the expert council, state secretary, deputy head of the FAS Andrei Tsarikovsky believes that this is not worth doing, because the general contractor must be responsible for the order.
And otherwise it will be, as in the famous replay of Arkady Rykin "Atelier": "There are claims to the buttons?".
Israeli children return to school after Gaza war
Thousands of Israeli children in the territories near the Gaza Strip returned to school on Monday after spending a summer in bomb shelters when rockets and mines fell on their settlements during the 50-day war between Israel and Hamas, while schools in the Gaza Strip remained closed while the territory was being restored after hostilities.
The start of school classes brought a sense of joy and excitement to the missile-affected settlements of southern Israel, but the traces of the fighting remained fresh.
In the southern city of Ashdod, employees of the kindergarten "Pashosh", which hit the rocket, removed traces of fragments from the walls and children's hills before the arrival of students.
“We’re a little scared, but looking forward to the future with joy,” said Ronit Bart, a resident of Kibuc Saad and an English teacher at his school.
Many children in our area really need to return to a measured life.
Her 11-year-old daughter, Shani Bart, said it was “a little strange” to start going to school again.
“It was a tough time and we didn’t leave our homes at all,” she said.
President Reuven Rivlin visited Kibutz, which is located near the Gaza border, to express his support.
Before a ceasefire agreement stopped the war last week, thousands of residents of border settlements such as Saad did not go out or left their homes, moving to safer areas further from Gaza to escape rocket and mortar fires.
Many inhabitants of Nahal Oz, a settlement near the Gaza border where a 4-year-old boy was killed by a Palestinian mine, doubt whether they should return.
The Ministry of Education said about a dozen families have not yet returned.
Their children were sent to other schools at this time.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visited a school in Sderot, a city on the Gaza border that has been heavily damaged by the Palestinian fire.
He advised the children to study diligently and said, "We will do our best to give you knowledge and ensure your safety."
Israel and Hamas agreed on an indefinite ceasefire on Tuesday.
The ceasefire agreement immediately put an end to hostilities, but key issues remained unresolved, such as Hamas’ demands to lift the Egyptian-Israeli blockade of Gaza and to open airports and seaports in the Gaza Strip.
Israel wants Hamas to lay down its weapons and return the bodies of two Israeli soldiers killed in the war.
A new phase of indirect talks is expected to begin later this month in Egypt.
More than 2,100 Palestinians were killed in the war, three-quarters of whom were civilians, and at least 494 children, according to estimates by the Palestinian side and the UN.
Israel disputes these figures and claims that at least half of the killed were militants; however, it has not provided substantial evidence supporting this claim.
On the Israeli side, 66 soldiers and six civilians were killed, including one Thai worker.
During the fighting, Hamas and other Gaza militants fired 4,591 units of missiles and mines at Israeli cities, mostly in the south of the country.
The Israeli army, meanwhile, carried out more than 5,000 air and other attacks.
As a result of Israeli attacks, thousands of houses in Gaza were damaged and destroyed, and an estimated 25,000 people have found refuge in more than 100 schools that have been converted into shelters.
Because tens of thousands of people were still in shelters and fighting continued, officials in charge of education postponed the start of the school year last week.
“I hope that the school will soon be opened so that we can complete our education as children around the world and Jewish children,” said Mohammad Amara, a 13-year-old boy who now lives in one of the schools in Gaza.
According to the popular criterion, property prices showed the largest winter growth in seven years.
The RP Data CoreLogic Hedonic housing price index for housing prices in the Australian capital rose by 1.1 percent in August, RP data on Monday.
This increase resulted in a combined 4.2% increase in June, July and August, the largest increase in winter months since 2007.
Annual price growth was 10.9 percent, more than doubling the growth in 12 months as of August 2013, but the increase was not evenly distributed across the country.
Research director of RP Data, Tim Lawless, said Sydney and Melbourne are leading a two-tiered market.
RP Data figures show that housing prices have risen 16.1% in Sydney over the past year, compared to 11.7% in Melbourne.
The next markets in power were Adelaide, Brisbane and Darwin, where prices rose on average from five to six percent.
On the other end of the scale was Canberra, where government spending cuts followed, where prices rose by just 1.4 percent in the year.
Mr. Lawless said that now that spring has begun, there will be an increase in the number of properties on sale over the next few months, which will be a “real test” for the market.
"Given the current high rate of auction sales, the overall high rate of sales and the current conditions with low interest rates, it is likely that the price of housing will continue to rise over the next three months," he said.
How people live in the oldest house of Ufa
In the former house of gold industrials and miners Evdokim and his son Ivan Demidov on the street of the October Revolution 57/1 (formerly the Great Kazan) 18 apartments.
The house of the 18th century has virtually not changed since the time of construction, except for the old age.
Foreign people go here, as on a tour, and the tenants suffer more than they rejoice, from their privilege - the right to live in the oldest Uffim house, the walls of which remember the commander Alexander Suvorov.
The date of construction of the house is inaccurate, historians point to two dates - 1730 and 1737 years.
In any case, it turns out that the building is less than 300 years old.
Old courtyard, always open doors, scaled stairs.
The doors to the apartments are located close to each other, the walls are crushed, and in the lights of the frozen patch the street is seen in places.
Everything seems to be on an honest word.
And the locals say, “You don’t think it is so.”
Living in a wooden house of the 18th century is very difficult, says Tatiana Lukyanova, a resident of apartment No. 3.
The object is in the state reserve, but the money for its content has not been allocated for decades, and we feel as museum exhibits, which the authorities have simply forgotten.
The last repair was 40 years ago.
The walls are still poorly held, but the foundation has all rotted.
Many residents still go to the toilet on the street, and wash once a week in the public bathroom.
How can you be happy in such circumstances?
The road runs right under the windows, there is no pedestrian zone.
Tatiana pushes off the curtain.
Now you can see what was only heard before: a stream of cars under the windows.
You see, the glasses are constantly drizzled, we cannot open the windows, but we are accustomed to the noise.
Man is accustomed to everything, good and bad.
Our apartment is still exemplary, thanks to my husband, his hands are golden.
In addition, we have two rooms, we live three with our son.
And in other families the conditions are much worse, on the second floor generally ceilings slightly more than one and a half meters high.
For contrast, Tatiana offers to visit a neighbor from apartment No. 6 Ludmila Starostina.
A nice hospitality woman from the doorstep offers a cup of coffee and with a sad smile tells:
We have a one-bedroom apartment, 14.5 m2 for four people, so we live: my husband and daughter and granddaughter.
I have been here since birth, there has never been another living space, - Lyudmila surrounds the room with her eyes: an anthrax, two sofas with the letter "g"; on one of them there was a granddaughter with a laptop.
Very close and little different from the usual domestic interior: only the ceilings are beautiful, "historical".
But the ceiling regularly flows: the water supply system is not suitable anywhere.
Lyudmila speaks of her apartment daily and surprisingly at the same time, like an Italian whose house stands on Roman ruins.
That is, it reduces to one very old and recent, everyday and legendary:
The water pipeline was built about 40 years ago during the last repair.
Then we made a small kitchen in the corner and a toilet from the former chulan.
We live just where Demidov lived with his family, servants lived on the second floor.
Our apartment is not privatized, and why?
In the Ufa Real Estate Center, it is said that privatization does not matter.
We only get a one-bedroom apartment, we can't claim more.
We were promised to relocate four months ago, but the promise did not go further.
I am not used to complaining and will not.
In this apartment (room!) lived a whole dynasty: my grandmother and grandfather, my mom and dad, my husband and my daughter and granddaughter.
Everything happened during that time.
For example, healthy rats ran through the kitchen.
Look at the walls of the fleece, they are metric thick!
It is said that the solution was mixed on the eggs, so it lasts so long.
The house is well built, thank you Demidov!
Probably only because so far no one has been killed by a falling ceiling or roof.
Only the building still slowly dies in front of us: the boards and bars of the house rot, the floors repeatedly failed, we poured cement, but everything is useless - the solution goes into the ground, like a well.
It is said that under our room there is a secret pit and a course to the White River, which was specially made by the old believers who once lived here, so that you could hide from danger, in case of anything.
They were persecuted.
Lyudmila Starostina tells how some historian came to them, begging to let him start excavations in the apartment.
And then I persuaded them to give them a living space in exchange for their one in the prospect of October.
Lyudmila rejected the historian:
Where are we all four?
And there is even a small hope that will give housing more space.
If we agreed to an exchange, we would have won nothing.
However, the old family won nothing.
Lyudmila’s greatest dream was that they would be displaced, and that their daughter and 16-year-old granddaughter would be given a separate room.
That is, for two families allocated a two-bedroom apartment instead of the most majestic ruins, in which two generations live now.
Cute, miniature girl Olesya Karsakova from apartments No. 11 and 12 shows the second floor of the house.
There, in two narrow rooms with a total area of 23 m2, called apartments, lives her large family.
We are seven people, two children.
You can see what conditions.
The fabric rolls out in pieces, like the window frames, in the walls in the kitchen and in the rooms through holes.
The water in the crane is cold all year round.
Walking through the apartments of the oldest house of Ufa, you can make sure that the most lucky spouses Lavrentiev from the apartment No. 4 were.
They occupy the most spacious rooms on the first floor.
You are right, there are lots of places.
A room of 75 squares, prescribed for three people.
We live in the rooms where, according to legend, Suvorov stayed during his stay in Ufa, - says the head of the family Alexander Dmitrievich Lavrentiev.
The ceilings are high and spacious.
One bad thing - everything around tears in the seams, collapses, collapses.
Neighbors probably told me.
The most torment we had with the floors: the wooden boards were rotten, the earth was literally going away from underneath our feet.
I put supports, cloves; there is nothing in the hall yet, and in another room we walk, as we swing on the stitches, so everything is shy.
About the house of merchant Evdokim Demidov Alexander Dmitrievich can tell better than any tour guide.
The gold industrialist is treated as a native, speaking about him with admiration.
Indeed, the personality was extraordinary: the owner of the Kagin and Uzyan factories built houses, cast guns and bells, held Ural mines.
Inheritors of commercial real estate are proud of their ancestors, but they no longer want to live under the same roof with history.
I settled here as a child, in the 40s of the 20th century, - says Alexander Dmitrievich.
Then around there were wooden rooms for carriages, barracks and guard houses, subsequently demolished.
In 1968, we wanted to clean up our house, but something stopped us.
The story repeated itself in 2014: we once again attracted new housing.
We, as a team, gathered all the documents, bypassed the necessary instances, and suddenly learned that the move to apartments is postponed for 2015 or 2016.
We no longer believe in all this.
Two years ago Lavrentiev went to the Ministry of Culture of the Republic of Bashkortostan to learn about the fate of the house.
The resident did not accept.
They sent from one table to another, and then, as a ridicule, issued a paper without signature and seal: "The Ministry of Culture does not object to the resettlement of residents."
I even had the feeling that our house has long been out of the city plan, because at first it was under the number 57, then it became 57 A, and now 57/1.
It was as if it had already been destroyed in the 1970s.
"Russkaya planeta" addressed the head of the information and analytical work sector of the Ufa Land Resources Administration Vladimir Barabas.
The house on the street of October Revolution 57/1 is included in the program of resettlement of old housing.
I cannot be held accountable for the actions of officials of the 1970s, but I know that at that time there was a plan to demolish all the old houses, despite the historical significance.
Fortunately, this did not happen, and the decision of the modern authorities - to restore all the old houses on the street of the October Revolution, which represent architectural value - is successfully carried out.
The residents are expected to move into new apartments soon.
According to Barabash, the restoration of the House of Demidov will be Italian specialists who participated in the restoration of buildings in Venice.
Now in Italy is taking place the architectural Biennale, and the project "Old Ufa" is presented there among others.
I hope that by 2016 the entire former Old Kazan Street will be restored, says the official.
Houses will acquire a proper appearance, corresponding to the one that was before, three centuries ago.
Demidov’s house is likely to become a museum open to all.
In addition, at the government level, it has been decided to make the street pedestrian on weekends.
Unfortunately, it will not work, too much traffic on the roads in the city.
To relocate people from the future museum Vladimir Barabash promises in 2015.
However, they are unlikely to be satisfied: their new apartments will be the same area as the current ones.
Only from another era.
In Primorye due to thunderstorm started a forest fire
The dry thunderstorm caused a forest fire on the territory of the Hunting area forestry in the Fire District of the Primorsky Territory.
At the site of the fire is being built grouping of forces and means.
According to the leadership of the KGBU "Primorskaya airbase", the conditions created at the scene of the fire require the involvement of the air force.
Vasily Medvedev, Deputy Head of the Air Base:
The fire, which arose in the hard-to-reach terrain, was detected by a pilot-observer on board the An-2 patrol aircraft on an area of 3 hectares.
The remains of wood are burned on the old burner.
The strong congestion of the territory and the steepness of the slope of more than 45 degrees, the absence of desant fire sites suitable for landing create significant difficulties in extinguishing.
We need a Mi-8 helicopter.
Delivery of forces available to the airbase by Mi-2 helicopter and An-2 aircraft is very difficult.
After the fire was detected, four parachutists were quickly dispatched to the place of extinguishment.
The main task of specialists is to extinguish the fire and prepare the site for the delivery of additional forces and fire extinguishing equipment.
In the area of lunch in the district of the village Hunting helicopter additionally delivered 3 desant firefighters.
As soon as the site for the landing of the helicopter in the area of the fire will be ready, the specialists will be transferred to the place of extinguishing, on the website of the administration of the Primorsky region.
Lenny Henry: My father never hugged me.
I never said, “I love you.”
Henry was one of seven children born to an immigrant family from Jamaica in Dudley, Midlands in 1958.
His father, who died when Henry was 19, worked in the factory, and their relationship was limited.
Henry rehearses a comedy, "The Rare Records of Rudy", which is partly based on imaginary conversations with his father and grew out of a series of shows on Radio 4.
Soundtrack is a mixture of reggae and rap, and the melodies are cheerful.
However, Henry had to break through some difficult childhood memories.
After his mother's death there was "a lot" of treatment, in addition, Henry often reflects on his relationship with his father.
He was very inaccessible.
You’ve never seen his face, you’ve only heard his voice, “Stop making noise.
Keep away from your sister.
They moved!
I want to watch cricket.
My older brothers Seymour and Hilton, who were grown up when I was a child, went to the pub with him and talked about things like the shape of a beer glass, the beauty of a cricket hit.
I never talked to him that way.
He was such a smiling guy in the corner who read the newspaper most of my life.
Henry recently opened a casting workshop in Dudley and, although the conditions were better than in his father’s days, he was able to look at what his life must have been.
Now there is a little better, but it is dark, smoky, depths of underground labyrinths with outbursts of fire and smoke and a bunch of saddle.
My father went into the bathroom and just lay there, and you heard him slowly singing about himself because he wanted to wash off from the casting workshop.
When I came there, I realized that he was doing this for years and years to make us a living, and I started to appreciate him more.
Nevertheless, Henry left his childhood deprived of parental love.
My father never hugged me, never said, “I love you.”
It was only when Mom got sick at the very end of her life that we started to say, “I love you, I love you, I love you.
The birth of his own daughter, Billy, from Don Frances, allowed him to share the love he lacked as a child.
Can you stop this “I love you”?
Stop hugging me!
Dad, I am 22!
With Don Franch.
Why not be friends with her?
She is a great mother.
They are still great friends with Franch, with whom he was married for 25 years.
Don is a good man.
Why shouldn’t I be friends with Don?
She is a great mother.
Henry’s mother had diabetes.
He was one of those who killed her.
So when I got very, very well and had symptoms of diabetes, my doctor said, “You need to take radical measures.
Then I started serious fitness classes, and I also had to sit on a strict diet to get rid of the symptoms.
It is very hard.
And it is boring.
No one eats carrots.
Henry’s change in career trajectory may be reflected in his noble, short-cut beard.
Since he received critical recognition for his Othello, he has fully immersed himself in the theatre.
It was followed by “The Comedy of Mistakes” and then “The Gardens” by August Wilson.
This work differs from sitcoms and comedies, which were an integral attribute of his busy professional life.
He started his career when he was 16 and worked in a factory.
DJ noticed how he parodied on the stage, and wrote about him in New Faces.
His television career began in the mid-1970s: "For a long time I was the only black parodist/comedian on television."
He studied at work.
Not only did I have to grow in front of the public, I had to learn to be an effective joke delivery machine between 1975 and 1985, being a star working on television, and it was very hard.
Lenny in New Faces, 1975
Since his manager had the rights to the Black and White Menstrel Show, a lightweight entertainment program in which people “blacked their faces,” Henry discovered that he was performing in it for five years.
My family did not like it very much.
I would like this to never happen to me, but I don’t regret doing it.
Although it was a strange, judgmental position, I worked on large venues and learned to work with the crowd.
But what was “a award-winning light entertainment classic on British television for years and years” was also “a grotesque parody on black people.”
Featuring characters who mocked and glorified black culture in Britain, Henry worked on an alternative comedy project in the eighties.
The first season of Lenny Henry's Show was broadcast in 1984, and in the 1990s he was known as, among other things, the chef Gareth Blacklock from the comedy series Chef!
Advertisements, documentaries, TV series, and film roles took the next ten years of his life, but after his 2008 BBC series LennyHenry.tv, he thought, “What are you going to do next, Len, because it’s a bit like you’re pulling the time or slowly turning aside.”
Then there was a series of documentaries on Radio 4 entitled “What’s good about...?”
The first was Shakespeare.
I was allergic to Shakespeare.
It cannot be said that I was taught this at school, and I thought it was, in many ways, the privilege of white middle-class people with socks and cabbage on the bottom of the front.
So I was very afraid of him.
Everyone we interviewed for the show, Peter Hall, Trevor Nann, Adrian Lester, and Judy Dench, said, “You have to try.
Don’t tell it until you know what you’re talking about.
Say some of these words out loud and you will understand why we all love Shakespeare so much.
Henry read 20 lines of Othello's last monologue for a documentary, and it got stuck.
I had the feeling that I could do it.
As if my head was fixed.
“This is a serious matter, take it seriously, study your text, do a little research.
So the rehearsal process was tough, and I read this play months and months before we put it.
And she had success.
They seemed to expect a disaster, but it did not happen.
Soon we started the “Comedy of Mistakes.”
Suddenly I was at the National Theatre, and I just couldn’t believe it to the end.
There was a moment when I thought, “Oh, you’ve changed.”
There was a technical failure, and Henry instinctively felt that his job was to entertain the audience.
A quiet voice inside me said, “You’ll have to work 10 minutes while they’re repairing the computer.”
Instead, the assistant director announced that the show would resume as soon as the problem was resolved.
I left the stage and something inside me said, “Oh, thank God.”
It is not my duty.
I can let someone else deal with it.
“You play in the play, stay in the role.”
Henry in "Zabory" at the Daechess Theatre
Learning the text for "Zabory" was difficult.
Panic is quite useful, it strengthens the muscles.
It was also well received, so it was like a sign from above, showing, “This is what you need to do.”
He says this with a loud voice.
So I stick to that.
I really like this.
I like to be in the rehearsal room.
By the way, Henry still has the thinking of a comedian - all the way our conversation is interrupted by flashes of his humor, when he starts, then ends parodying.
I just decided not to work in a stand-up because getting an instant reward from a full room of strangers, I think, is pretty dangerous.
If you strive for it all the time, it can lead to an impasse.
I sometimes work on Live at Apollo when I want to, but, basically, I don’t get as much pleasure as I did before.
I’m wondering if he’ll give a standalone tour again someday.
The pleasure of sitting in a room with a director who helps shape the beginning, middle and end of the journey – I don’t think I’ll ever want to give it up.
Is this his new incarnation?
I think so.
I like to be an actor.
It is a pleasant fun.
You always tell a story, and this is a great place to do it.
I love stories.
People love stories.
Kenya to register government officials to identify “invisible workers”
Kenya has begun biometric registration of all public servants in an attempt to remove “invisible workers” from the government’s payment records.
Employees who do not register within the next two weeks will no longer be paid, the government said in a statement.
The government suspects that thousands of people continue to receive wages after leaving the public service.
President Uhuru Kenyatta has vowed to reduce corruption in government structures after coming to power in 2013.
An audit earlier this year found that at least $1 million (£700,000) per month was lost due to payments to “invisible workers” and other financial violations.
The government suspects that salaries continue to flow to bank accounts even after a person dies or leaves the public service, BBC reporter Vanyama Chebusiri from the capital, Nairobi, reports.
All public servants must appear at the identification centers within the next two weeks to ensure that their data will be collected through a biometric registration procedure, the government said in a statement.
Anyone who does not do so without a valid reason will be removed from the payment record.
“This procedure will significantly facilitate the rationalization of public service by determining the actual number of public servants, and will also be used to clear payment records at both levels of government – thus ending the problem of ‘invisible workers,’” said Anne Vaiguru, secretary of the Cabinet of Ministers of Planning and Structuring Power.
Dozens of Turkish police arrested in connection with "conspiracy" against the government
A total of 33 police officers have been detained in Turkey on suspicion of “conspiracy against the government,” local news agencies.
Police did not immediately comment on this information.
Among the arrested were 14 senior officers, according to Hurriyet Daley News.
Some of them last December participated in corruption investigations aimed at verifying government officials, including four government ministers.
In July, several Turkish police officers were arrested on suspicion of creating an organized criminal group and intercepting a telephone.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan (who was Prime Minister at the time) described their actions as part of measures taken against him and others in power, the Islamic cleric Fethullah Gülen.
Not all children returned to school in Ukraine
Schools in most parts of Ukraine reopened their doors on Monday (1 September) after the summer holidays.
This day is traditionally a big event for families, and, like thousands of other Ukrainian parents, Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk took his daughter to school.
There he told waiting journalists that not all schools were reopened, but that he would do everything he could to protect the country for future generations:
On September 1st, the ceremony was held in every school.
There is no peaceful sky over every part of Ukraine.
We must fight for a peaceful sky.
The entire Ukraine, a huge unified Ukrainian People’s Front, must fight for a peaceful sky.
Alexander Pastuchov, the director of the school in Slavyansk, where Yatsenyuk’s daughter went, spoke Russian.
We hope that the world will finally settle here and that children will gain knowledge that will be useful in their future lives.
The first day of school is traditionally celebrated by the fact that children wear shirts, hold balls in their hands and give flowers to their teachers.
In the face of Ron Fairhead, the BBC may have found such an impressive leader she needs.
It is followed by a slate of fame from the world of banking, media management and the internal circles of the Tory Party.
In fact, she has her own experience in managerial positions.
Her career began at global management consultancy Bain and Co. and then continued at Morgan Stanley, Bombadier, ICI and the media world at Pearsons.
She was the chief executive of the Financial Times for seven years after resigning when a senior post at Pearson's headquarters was taken by a male colleague who held a lower position.
It is said that her earnings are approaching £1 million.
Its political rating is also strong.
She was recommended to David Cameron by Lord Brown, the former head of BP, when he tried to bring private sector specialists to Whitehall: she became a cabinet adviser.
Her husband is a former adviser to Tory.
Earlier in May, I called the chairman’s work a poisoned cup.
The BBC is not only a huge and complex organization at the very heart of public life, but there is an internal paradox in its structure.
The council has two orientations: inside as the upper level of the management hierarchy of the BBC itself, but also outside as the voice of public anxiety and agitation when something goes wrong.
This is an almost unattainable duopoly, which requires a complete radical reform.
However, what new chairman would risk to come, crushing and destroying an institution as complex as the Chinese dynasty, if he himself lost his job in the process.
It is a difficult decision.
Were it not so difficult, many people would be delighted to see the BBC shrink in size – after reviewing its powers, finances, and status.
As competitors narrow the circle and new technologies challenge cozy old habits, the inevitable negotiations about the cost of a license pose a particular danger to the BBC.
For a modest sum of £145.50 a year, the British acquire a stake in the world’s largest media enterprise.
The BBC tells a good story: it states that the results of its work cover 96 percent of households and cost each of them just 40p a day.
Moreover, it is obvious that Beeb’s popularity is growing: 53 percent support it today against 31 percent 10 years ago.
BBC’s patterns of viewing and using have changed: I now get news headlines on my mobile phone and watch missed programs on iPlayer.
But it remains a very popular and impressive institution.
He needs an impressive chairman – I hope he has found him.
Perry from Texas says the humiliating tweet was written by an outsider
A tweet from the confirmed account of Texas Governor Republican Rick Perry on Sunday night contained an insulting image of a Democratic district prosecutor who is at the heart of a criminal prosecution on charges of abuse of power.
The tweet was later deleted, followed by another from Perry’s account, in which the record was disavowed.
I just posted a tweet from my account, which was written by a stranger.
“I disapprove of this tweet, and I removed it,” a later post said.
Perry’s assistants did not immediately respond to messages asking for comments.
Although the recordings were uploaded from Perry’s verified account, it was unclear who was actually publishing the tape.
An earlier tweet contained a caricature of County Attorney Travis Rosemary Lemberg, who was found guilty of driving intoxicated in April 2013.
Perry imposed a ban on funding for her department when she refused to resign, leading to a grand jury trial in Austin this month against Perry, who is a potential presidential candidate in the 2016 election.
“I don’t always drive in a state of drunkenness three times the permissible level of alcohol in the blood... but when I do, I accuse Governor Perry of telling me about it.”
I am the drunkest Democrat in Texas.
The Lemberg Office did not conduct a large jury investigation against Perry.
It was handled by Michael McCrum, a special prosecutor from San Antonio, who was appointed a Republican judge.
Perry did not acknowledge guilt and called the charges a political trick.
His powerful legal team has asked the judge in charge of the case to reject the indictment, saying the law used to prosecute the governor, who has served for the longest time in Texas' history, will dispel what is contrary to the constitution.
Perry stopped funding for $7.5 million from state funds to the State Public Control Department, which is based in Travis County and pursues corruption in the Texas public sector, when Lemberg refused to resign.
The veto caused an official complaint from a left-wing public control group.
Perry’s verified account bar is frequently updated – and sometimes becomes famous.
Coming fifth at the party's congress in Iowa during his 2012 presidential campaign, Perry responded to rumors that he might be out of the game by posting a tweet with a photo of himself running by the lake and the words, "Here are we, South Carolina!"
Berkeley reports that the real estate market has returned to "normal"
One of London’s most famous developers has warned that the real estate market in southeastern England has “returned” to normal activity.
Houses in the capital were the subject of lively demand and rapidly rising prices, with widespread fears that the credit bubble would push the Bank of England to impose mortgage limits in June.
Tony Pidgey, founder and chairman of Berkeley’s elite construction company, said Monday: “Since the beginning of the current fiscal year, the market has returned to normal transaction levels since its peak in 2013,” adding that this has provided a “stable working environment.”
London’s real estate market succeeded during the recession as foreign buyers moved to the capital.
Prices in the city jumped by 18.5 percent only last year, according to the Land Cadastre, significantly outperforming the average of 6.7 percent for England and Wales as a whole.
The average market prices on Berkeley’s private, affordable and student schemes grew by approximately one-fifth last year, reaching £423,000 at the end of April.
However, the strengthening of the pound in recent months has made London real estate less attractive to foreign buyers, some of whom have also stopped the introduction of new real estate taxes and political rhetoric around a potential "villa tax" ahead of the general election next May.
London real estate agency Foxtons warned last week that the April mortgage market reform, which imposed tighter loan terms, would also result in a decline in market growth in both real estate transactions and prices in the second half of the year.
New data from the Bank of England on Monday showed a drop in the number of approved mortgages in June, suggesting a further cooling in the housing market.
Hamptons International, another real estate agency, has cut its forecast for London real estate price growth for 2015 to 3 percent based on the fact that the real estate price setting has already begun to weaken.
Meanwhile, transaction volumes fell by a quarter compared to the previous year in London’s most expensive districts, such as Chelsea, Mayfair and Kensington, according to WA Ellis.
Nevertheless, the demand for houses in the capital proved to be very profitable for Berkeley, raising sales of over £2.2 billion.
Mr. Pidžli added: “The demand for the right product with a good design and better location remained the same and, reflecting this, sales for the time being remained.”
In June, the company that it had sold 3,742 new homes this year by the end of April, almost a third more than in the pre-crisis peak of 2007.
Annual profit before tax increased by 40 percent from the previous year to £380 million, and income by 18 percent to £1.6 billion.
Speaking on Monday before the company’s annual meeting, Mr. Pidžli said Berkeley’s estimated revenue for this year would meet current market expectations.
According to the unanimous opinion of analysts, profit for the whole year is expected before the payment of taxes of £450 million.
Berkeley shares stood at £23.96 on the London Stock Exchange in the afternoon.
Nude photos of Jennifer Lawrence posted on the Internet by hackers
Jennifer Lawrence arrives at the 85th annual American Film Academy Awards ceremony.
Photos of the naked actress Jennifer Lawrence, who won the Oscar, were posted on the Internet by a hacker who claims to have a "catalogue" of photos of another 100 rising stars.
A spokesman for the star of the Hunger Games confirmed that the photographs of Lawrence are genuine, and condemned the hacker for "abrupt intrusion into personal space".
The law enforcement agencies have appealed, and they will prosecute anyone who publishes the stolen photos of Jennifer Lawrence.
The photos that were originally posted on the photo sharing site 4chan were allegedly taken due to a shortage of Apple’s online storage system iCloud, and the alleged “catalogue” of victims of the hack includes the names of dozens of female celebrities, including Rihanna, Kim Kardashian, Mary Elizabeth Winstad and Mary-Kate Olsen, according to BuzzFeed.
It’s unclear how many of these photos are authentic, although “Scott Pilgrim vs. Everyone” star Winstad on Twitter also condemned the hack.
“To those of you who look at the photos we took with my husband a few years ago while alone at home, I hope you’re proud of yourself,” Winston wrote on Twitter.
However, Victoria Justis of the Nickolodeon series "iCarly" and "Victoria the Winner" denied that the photos she wrote on Twitter: "These so-called photos of naked me FALSE, people.
Let me stop this in the embryo. *calampur intentional*.
Buzzfeed last Sunday that a spokesman for pop star Ariana Grande has denied that the photos on which she is supposed to be authentic.
An exclusive passage from Howard Jacobson's new novel about love and the letter "J", which has caused critics to praise
They dissolved, best to say, they gradually collapsed, like a cardboard box left in the rain.
Only sometimes the woman told him that he was too serious, tough at communicating, tense, closed, and a little irritable.
Then she shrugged his hand.
He saw an irritation in himself.
He was like a shark, yes.
The last victim of this bullshit was a little novel from which he expected more than usual, the release from a lonely and boring life, and even some satisfaction.
Eileen Solomons was a tremendously brittle beauty with shattered hair and a tremendous heart from a northern island village, even more remote and harsh than Port Robben.
She came to the south with a companion older than herself, whom Kevern considered her aunt, with the latter inheriting a house in a crisp but paradise-like valley under the joyful name "Paradise Valley".
No one lived in the house for several years.
The tubes flowed, the spiders sat still in the baths, the mucus left its traces on all the windows, confident that the house belonged to them; the garden grew with weeds similar to giant cabbage coats.
It was like a children’s book cottage, both frightening and charming, with a garden full of mystery.
A look at the author: Howard Jacobson, whose novel “J” was included in the 2014 Booker Prize longlist.
The shortlist will be announced next week.
Kevin and Eileen sat, holding their arms, in broken lounges among the high grass, enjoying an unexpectedly warm spring day; they both dispersed to a cheap console that supplied the country with soothing music and reassuring news when, looking at her crossed brown legs, he recalled the old song of a long-forgotten black performer that his father loved to listen to, dropping the curtains in the house.
You have too big legs.
Due to their inherent aggressiveness, songs of this type on the console were no longer lost.
They were not banned – nothing was actually banned – they were simply not lost anymore.
They were helped to become archaic, like the word “archaic.”
The social taste did what would never have been achieved by orders and orders, and just as among the books people chose the memoirs of the rich who grew up in poverty, the cookbooks and the love novels, from all the music they chose the ballads.
Attracted by that day, Kevin began playing imaginary piano and a rough comic voice to sing Eileen's big legs.
Eileen did not understand.
“It was a popular song by a jazz pianist whose name was Fats Waller,” he told her, automatically attaching two fingers to her lips.
That’s how his father always did to stop the letter “J” before it flew from his lips.
It started with the game they played when he was a kid.
His father played it with his father, as he told him.
Start a word with "J" forgetting to attach two fingers to your mouth - and it will cost you a penny.
It wasn’t a very fun game then, and it wasn’t very fun now.
He knew he was waiting for it, that was all.
He had to explain what jazz was.
Eileen had never heard of him.
Jazz was also not played, although it was not openly banned.
Improvisation is out of fashion.
There is only one “if” in life.
When the song began, people wanted to know exactly where it would end.
With intelligence exactly the same.
His unpredictability acted on people’s nerves.
Jazz was a genius expressed through music.
Although he reached the age of 10 and had never heard of Sammy Davis the Younger, Kevin knew about jazz from his father’s semi-secret CD collection.
But at least he didn’t have to tell Eileen that Fats Waller was black.
Given her age, she hardly remembered a time when popular singers weren’t black.
Again, no laws or pressure.
The society was obedient, and this meant that each of its segments agreed with gratitude—the gratitude of those preserved by fate—to the principle of group predisposition.
People of African-Caribbean descent in temperament and physical characteristics were well suited for entertainment and sports - and they sang and ran.
Indians from Indostan, as if by nature talented in everything concerning electronics, took care that no family would be left without a working electronic phone.
What remained of the Polish diaspora was sanitary work; what remained of the Greek diaspora were plates.
The descendants of the Persian Gulf and the Levant, whose grandparents did not quickly leave the country when THAT HAVE Happened, if anything else HAVE Happened, in fear that they would be accused of igniting the flame, in fear, actually speaking, that the flame would swallow them next, opened restaurants with lawns and canyons, did not rush and longed for nothing.
Everyone by ability.
Since she had previously only heard ballads, Eileen had difficulty understanding how the offensive words that Kevin had just sung to her could have been put on music.
Music is an expression of love.
“They’re not really offensive,” Kevern said.
Especially for people with big legs.
My father never insulted anyone, but he loved this song.
He said too much, but the abandoned garden gave him the illusion of security.
No word could penetrate through the sound insulation of giant leaves like cabbage.
Eileen did not understand.
How could your father love that?
He wanted to say it was a joke, but he didn’t want to press his fingers to his lips again.
She already thought him strange.
“It seemed funny to him,” he said instead.
She suspiciously shrugged her head, closing Kevin's view.
In the whole world there was nothing but a bunch of her blue-black hair.
Nothing he would like to see.
“Well, if you say that,” she said, staying with her opinion.
But that doesn’t explain why you sing it to me.
She seemed really upset.
Do I have too big legs?
He looked at them again.
I cannot say, no.
Hips, maybe a little bit.
And you say you hate me because my ankle is too thick?
I hate you?
Of course, I do not hate you.
This is just that stupid song.
He could say, “I love you,” but it was too early for that.
“I like you because you have thick ankles,” he tried to say instead.
I have this distortion.
It sounded wrong.
He wanted it to be funny.
Attempts to joke often brought him into uncomfortable situations, because, like his father, he lacked the soothing charm that could soften the cruelty hidden in jokes.
Maybe his father wanted to be cruel.
Maybe he, Kevin, also wanted to.
Despite the good eyes.
Eileen Solomons turned red and got up from the couch, overturning the console and the strait of wine they were drinking.
The wine was from the buzz, so that drunkenness could not serve as an excuse for him.
In her agitation, she seemed to tremble like palm leaves in a hurricane.
“I like you because you have a dumb head,” she said.
Although you do not like.
He was sorry for her and for the excessive rudeness of his words, and for the fear that appeared in her gaze when she resisted him.
Did she think he would hit her?
She didn’t talk to him about life in the cold northern archipelago where she grew up, but he didn’t doubt that in essence she was similar to the one there.
The same huge ocean of ice fell on them both.
The same confused men, even more sensitive and capricious after THAT Happened, if EVER Happened than their ancestors, smugglers and destroyers, wandered furiously from pub to pub, ready to raise their hand on any woman daring to deny them or irritate them.
A stupid head?
They would have shown her a stupid fist if she hadn’t been careful!
First they would kiss — the kiss has now become the most common expression of erotic irritation between a man and a woman; the antidote to the fresh ballads that the console issued is to first kiss her, and then hit her.
Unnecessary clarification, according to Kevin, because the kiss itself was already a hooliganism.
Eileen Solomons showed the corps that he needed to leave.
He stood up from the couch like an old man.
She felt the weight of lead, but the weight of his sorrow surprised her.
It was not the end of the world.
They barely knew each other.
She looked at him leaving, and from the upper window she looked at him leaving, her companion was a man who had taken on himself the burdens.
Adam, leaving the garden, thought she.
She felt an injection of compassion for him and the men in general, although some of them raised their hands on her.
The man who turned away from her, with her back folded, ashamed, battled, all the ability to fight left him — why did she think she knew it so well, if she could not remember any case, until today, when she would have seen it?
Once again, Eileen Solomons looked at her feet.
Twenty years before the events described above, or about that, Esme Nussbaum, a smart and energetic 32-year-old researcher who worked at Offnao, the unofficial Public Mood Control Service, prepared a small report on the preservation of low and medium levels of violence in the very parts of the country where it was expected to decrease, if not stop at all, given the means and forces that were devoted to its eradication.
“A lot has been done, and a lot is being done,” she wrote, “to mitigate the innate aggression of the people who fought in a thousand wars and won most of them, especially among these confused branches and narrow settlements of the area where, despite the spires of churches blowing over the fence, the gentle breath of human kindness has rarely been felt throughout history.
However, some qualities are inexhaustible.
The higher the spire seems to be, the lower the passions it engenders.
The population sheds tears over sentimental ballads, swallows stories of overcome obstacles and proclaims their ardent belief in the virtues of marriage and family life, but not only does the old rudeness retain its strong grip in both rural communities and urban settlements, but there is also evidence that a new and evil turmoil is born in homes, at workplaces, on roads and even on playgrounds.
"You have an annoying habit of writing too much," her academic supervisor said after reading the entire report.
I think you should read fewer novels.
Esme Nussbaum lowered her head.
I also have to ask you: Are you an atheist?
“I don’t think I’m obliged to answer,” said Esme Nussbaum.
Are you a lesbian?
Esme once again insisted on her right to privacy and silence.
A feminist ?
Still silence again.
“I ask,” Luther Rabinovitz finally said, “not because I am against atheism, lesbianism, or feminism.
There are no prejudices here.
We are servants of society without prejudice.
But some types of hypersensitivity, absolutely acceptable and praiseful in themselves, can sometimes distort the results, such as the ones you showed me.
Obviously, you yourself are prejudiced against the church, and what you call "evil" and "rough" would be interpreted by others as an expression of natural vitality and vigor.
To continue to worry about what happened, if it happened, as if it happened, if it happened yesterday, is to deprive the country of the vitality it needs.
Esme Nussbaum looked around while Rabinovitz was speaking.
Behind his head, pink, flamingo-like LED letters repeated the advice that Offnaugh had given the country for the last quarter of a century or more.
Smile to your neighbor, appreciate your spouse, listen to ballads, go to the musicals, talk on the phone, communicate, explain, listen, agree, apologize.
Talk is better than silence, the word of a song is better than a written word, but there is nothing better than love.
“I fully understand what you mean,” Esme Nussbaum answered quietly when she made sure that her scientific supervisor had finished speaking, “and I don’t want to say anything but that we haven’t healed as effectively as we persuade ourselves.
I am worried that if we are not prepared, we will find that we are repeating the mistakes that originally led to THAT Happened, if Happened at all.
Only this time will we throw out our anger and distrust not on others.
Luther Rabinovitz connected his fingers into a pyramid.
This gesture meant endless patience.
“You’re going too far,” he said, “calling ‘mistakes’ the actions that our grandparents did or did not do.
You go too far when you talk about them throwing out their “irritation” and “dissidence” on “other.”
In your place, a person should not need to be reminded that by understanding the past, that is, by protecting the present, we are not talking about “us” and “them”.
There were no “us” and there were no “other”.
It was a time of turmoil – that’s all we know.
"For which, if we are honest with ourselves," Esme dared to insert, "no part of society can well justify itself.
I do not blame anyone.
Whether it was good or bad, what was done, it was done.
It was then.
Nothing more to say, I agree here.
And as it is not necessary to blame anyone, it is not necessary to justify yourself if it was appropriate or if something could be corrected.
But why the past, if not to learn,
The past exists for us to forget it.
If I can add one word,
The pyramid of Luther Rabinovitz has collapsed.
“I will examine your report,” he said, releasing her.
The next day, on the way to work, she was shot down by a motorcyclist, who went to the sidewalk, as the passers described, "in anger."
Coincidence is happening.
Lesotho army says coup was not planned; prime minister remains in South Africa
Lesotho army officials denied preparing a coup to overthrow the government, saying they acted against the police, suspected of trying to arm political fanatics.
Prime Minister Thomas Tabane has left the country, saying the country’s army has surrounded his official residence and seized government buildings in the capital Maseru.
The prime minister took his family to neighboring South Africa, saying he was threatened with a murder.
Army spokesman Major Ntle Ntoi said there was not actually a coup, but that the army responded to the threat from “political fanatics” whom the police tried to arm.
"What happened this morning is that the Lesotho Armed Forces Command took action after receiving several intelligence reports that there are some elements among the police forces that really plan to arm some of the political, young fanatics of political parties who were prepared to organize chaos," he told the Voice of America.
South African government spokesman Clayson Monella said the military’s actions looked like a coup.
"Al no one has claimed to seize power by force, according to all reports, the actions of Lesotho's armed forces at the moment have the main signs of a coup," he said.
Lesotho army officials said the soldiers had returned to the barracks on Sunday and that it was calm in the capital.
Meanwhile, Deputy Prime Minister Motetjoa Matting runs the government in Tabane’s absence.
Tabane said he believes he is being attacked in connection with an attempt to fight corruption in the country.
The situation in Lesotho has been very tense since June, when Tabane suspended parliamentary sessions as a result of disagreements in his united government.
He said his actions did not undermine the government, despite accusations of the opposite.
Chelsea midfielder Marco van Ginkel will spend the upcoming season on lease rights in Milan, reports Milan Channel.
The 21-year-old Dutchman will arrive in Italy in the coming hours for medical examination.
In the previous season, he appeared on the field for the London club only three times.
Recall that previously "Milan" rented from "Liverpool" attacker Fernando Torres.
Eurozone production at lowest in 13 months
Production growth in the euro area slowed to its lowest level in 13 months in August, according to a popular survey.
The latest value of the euro area manufacturing sector’s business activity index (PMI) for Markit fell to the mark of 50.7 in August, down from 51.8 in July.
A value above 50 indicates growth.
New orders have been delayed and have suffered amid rising tensions between the EU and Russia over Ukraine.
The values were submitted before the European Central Bank (ECB) meeting on Thursday.
The markets will expect the bank to have a clear plan on how to deal with a halt to the recovery in the eurozone, as well as the threat of deflation with inflation of just 0.3%.
It is suggested that ECB chief Mario Draghi may give additional signals later this week that he is considering a quantitative easing scheme for the eurozone similar to those used by the UK and the US during the financial crisis.
“Al some growth is better than no growth at all, the inhibitory effect of growing economic and geopolitical uncertainty on producers is becoming more obvious,” said Rob Dobson, senior economist at Markit.
PMI of the manufacturing sector of Germany, Russia’s largest trading partner in the EU, fell to the lowest in 11 months of the mark of 51.4.
Meanwhile, in the bloc’s second-largest economy, France, the PMI fell to 46.9.
France continues to cause real concern, as does the weakening of Italy from stable growth to stagnation.
The signs that the growth momentum has faded in the mainly industrial engine, Germany, as well as Spain and the Netherlands, also do not add confidence,” said Mr. Dobson.
The slowdown in the industry is likely to add more oil to analysts expecting additional monetary or fiscal incentives.
One positive news came from Ireland, where the PMI grew to 57.3, its highest level since late 1999.
Howard Archer, chief economist at IHS Global Insight, said: “The best thing to say about the Eurozone’s August Business Activity Index is that it shows that the sector is still growing.”
He added: “Producers in the eurozone obviously find life very tough at the moment, as the current increased geopolitical tension – especially related to Russia/Ukraine – adds uncertainty to the still difficult conditions in many countries.
This increased tension has obviously hit the business — and especially consumer confidence — and likely leads to some orders being delayed or even cancelled, especially large orders.
He said that “it seems more and more” that the ECB will eventually have to carry out some sort of quantitative easing “although we suspect it will be limited.”
Inhabitants of Mariupol will display a live chain against the militias
In Mariupol until last week, everything was calm – no one rushed to organize the Mariupol People’s Republic, the city on the Sea of Azov lived and worked.
Now the residents are waiting with horror for the arrival of the “militia.”
According to political scientists, the separatists are breaking to Mariupol to reach the Sea of Azov - recently the city of Novozovsk was taken, which previously was also not part of the self-proclaimed republics.
Mariupol decides that the Ukrainian army, although it will protect them, but has little strength against the well-armed representatives of the DPR-LPR, and gathered to help the military.
They dig barracks, build blockposts and fortifications.
In the evening of Saturday, several thousand residents came to the eastern border of the city, and stood there in a live chain, singing the national anthem of Ukraine.
They will do the same in the event of an attack.
Volunteers collect and drive equipment and products, collect medicines, publish newspapers.
In the city, shops are gradually closing, banks and ATMs are shutting down.
Ten years of hell for the survivors of Beslan: Ten years since the horrific seizure of the school as the children who found themselves in it still suffer
Ten years ago, more than 1,000 people were taken hostage by Chechen militants at a school in Beslan, in southern Russia.
More than 330 people, more than half of them children, were killed during this three-day trial that shook the world.
We returned to Beslan to find some of the victims who cheated death during the school atrocity.
Ten years after the horrific seizure of the school in Beslan, which killed 334 people, including 186 children, the heroic survivors of the disaster were warned yesterday evening of a new apocalypse in Ukraine.
When terrorists, Islamic fanatics, captured and killed children and parents on September 1, 2004, at the beginning of the new quarter, it seemed like something of the extreme extent of possible evil.
The tragedy united the East and the West in disgust, which surprisingly then grew into action and hope for the future in conditions of great sorrow.
Ten years later, we returned to Beslan, in southern Russia, to find some of the victims who deceived death during a school atrocity.
We have found amazing young people who have faced trouble, although the memories of the terrorist hell will live with them forever.
Their greatest hope?
That the war that now plagues Ukraine, in which children like them die, will now cease.
The girl in the photo is trying to get back into the bombed sports hall
She was captured on the photo of the famous Russian photographer Dmitry Beljakov, when in one underwear she tried to get back into the sports hall being bombed after the mine exploded.
In confusion, Aida was desperately looking for her mother, Larisa, who is now 40.
There were fears that both were killed, but they actually survived.
“The woman told me to run, but I couldn’t,” Aida said.
My feet were covered with blood.
I got up and went back inside to find my mother.
The soldier picked her up and took her to a safe place.
After a series of surgeries, she thought she had fully recovered, but yesterday she said: "Three months ago the pain returned.
I am afraid I may need another operation.
A few fragments remained in my knee.
Her goal now is to become a dentist, to help people just as doctors helped her.
"This tragedy changed my life, but it didn't break it," she says with a challenge.
“It happened to me, and this fact cannot be changed.
Once a year, I always go to this gym to remember everyone who stayed there.
My friends and I try not to talk about it on other days.
The pain is too strong.
My best friend, who was supposed to be my classmate, Dzera Gapoeva, was killed there.
We played together when we were young and dreamed that we would go to school together.
“I don’t want to get married until I finish school and start working.
I’ll think about my family later.
She says the capture remains with her, although her memories get a bit dim each year.
I’m glad that many people in the world still remember our troubles, and we’re so grateful for the help we’ve received from people from the UK and everywhere.
When I see a photo on the internet where I climb the school window, I think many people will see it for the first time, learn about our tragedy and make sure it doesn’t happen again.
The boy who ran through a bullet town believing his mother was dead
It was his first day at school (the Russians start school at 7 years old) and survived three days of capture, hugging his mother, Tamara.
When he was seven, he said, “Mom told me to lie down if there was an explosion and hold her hand.”
After one of the explosions, he thought she was dying.
She said to him, “Run away.”
Fearing that she was dead, he ran and on the way saw a crying baby, grabbed the child by the hand and ran through the town with a bullet.
His father Vladimir, who grabbed his son from the outside, said: "Damir told me that his mother was dead.
He said, “I couldn’t save her.”
In fact, Tamara was released and was in the hospital with wounds to her legs, in turn thinking that her son was killed.
After their reunion, she said, “I was crying out of joy.
I could not believe it.
He ran and embraced me.
Damir was later brought to London (now the non-existent newspaper News of the World), where he was awarded as Barnardo's Children's Defender by Prime Minister Tony Blair and his wife Sherry.
"This horror comes back to you every day, but I wish I could stop remembering it," he said yesterday.
However, I can say that in my memory he is dull.
I remember throwing out all my toy weapons immediately after that.
But now I can play computer games with shooting, and that’s not a problem for me.
“I’m not afraid to go back to that gym, but I don’t think about myself.
I remember those children with whom I played in the courtyard who never got out.
We never say they are killed or dead.
We say they stayed in the sports hall.
I remember my trip to London so well, especially a toy store where I was allowed to choose anything I wanted and a ride in an open-air car.
But now he fears for places like Ukraine, where wars lead to such a bitterness that he and his friends have experienced.
This horror comes back to you every day, but I wish I could stop remembering it.
“I’m so sorry for all those who suffer from these horrors,” said Damir, who worked as a volunteer at a women’s monastery last week.
I want to help so.
I want to serve in the police one day and hope to be enrolled in the training academy next year.
His mother, Tamara, 48, said: “37 children were killed in our neighborhood, can you imagine?
I remember the terrible silence immediately after the capture, just there were no children screaming and running around, and that silence lasted for months.
She clearly remembers her trip to London with Damir.
People in London were crying when I was telling our story.
I understood then how people at the other end of the world can understand our feelings, can provide support.
She was grateful to "Sherry Blair and her foundation for the award and the opportunity to go to London in the fall of 2004.
I would like to call Sherry and just tell her that 10 years have passed, but I still remember meeting her and her husband in London and how they helped Damir and me.
I remember when Damir wanted to eat borscha, they called all the local Russian restaurants.
I remember playing with the waiters in a restaurant, Damir shooting at them with his water gun, and they ran away and played with him.
Only a month has passed since my nightmare.
I was shocked that the British were so willing to share our pain and support us.
She said, “I all think the world hasn’t gotten better in the last 10 years.
Now there is war in Ukraine, people die every day, and I think a lot of children have been killed and will be killed.
They are just the same children as ours.
I think for many people, war is a news report they listen to when they’re bored or when they’re busy with something else.
I just know what these people feel, the horror of that.
I can’t stop feeling it.
Nothing has changed, people still want to kill each other, and that’s so sad.
Damir grew up and became a very gentle and calm boy, he is not aggressive or angry at all.
He is not seeking revenge, for example, he is not stuck in this past nightmare.
I know he doesn’t like to remember him, but they’re very close to six classmates and they go to the gym from time to time and light candles there.
When he was younger, he suffered from it – I remember lying on the couch, turning away from us, for hours.
He wasn’t sleeping, his eyes were open.
I also remember how he dropped all his weapons and other military toys.Damiru is now 17, he is above me, cute, smart and healthy.
I can hardly believe that for a few hours I was so sure that he was dead and that I would never see him again.
When I was able to recover from the explosion and get up on my feet, I looked around, I saw hell around me, as pieces of bodies lay everywhere.
I was absolutely sure that it was impossible for my little boy to survive in this hell.
“I remember screaming to him, ‘Damir, run, run,’ but again I was so sure he didn’t hear me.
He heard and fled.
So life goes on for us, unlike so many others.
George Ilvin, 17 years old
The boy whose shocking photo after capture became decisive for the tragedy in Beslan
Rest: the survivor of Beslan, Georgy Ilin, with his mother Fatima after the capture in 2004, and on the right, Georgy today
His bloody face had a mark of fear as he escaped death when Chechen terrorists shot his classmates.
His photograph was one of the most shocking symbols of barbarism in Beslan.
His mother, Fatima, 54, the chief physician, took him to school on the first day of school before taking Vladimir’s eldest son to university.
“I left two minutes before the terrorists ran into the yard, so my little boy was left alone for three days of a nightmare,” she recalled.
Not quite alone, there was a family of our relatives, but they were all killed.
Only George was able to survive.
The closer this date, the harder it is to think and talk about it.
There is no day that we do not remember this tragedy.
We don’t think it’s been a long time ago, I think it happened yesterday, some scenes of these days all the time in front of me.
No one will ever forget, I promise you.
Falling into the soul: George’s photo (left) was one of the most shocking images of the attack and was perpetuated in the sculpture (right)
I remember George wanted to go to school that day so much that he said he wanted to embrace the teacher.
I only found out he was alive when I saw him on TV.
And now there is even a sculpture of the crying George in San Marino.
George doesn’t like to look at this photo, and it’s hidden in the bookcase at our house.
I understand, but it also seems to me that people around the world feel our pain because of this photo.
George says now, “It’s important that this never happens again.
“I doubt we will ever find out the truth.
People continue to investigate such tragedies and will never find out the truth.
Now they are investigating the Boeing crash in Ukraine.
Will we ever know what it was caused by?
This world is going to something very bad.
“I can’t understand how this happens, because if you ask people, nobody wants war, because how does it happen?
Ten years is nothing for that pain.
It takes us a few decades to forget about it.
It has affected my health, and I still feel it.
About three or four years ago I had nightmares because of the capture, but now it’s getting better.
I returned to school later in 2004, and I was very scared every day.
I thought of my friends and classmates who were killed.
That’s why I continue to go to this sports hall before every September 1st.
I want to pay tribute to my old friends of childhood.
It’s hard for me to get into the gym, but I have to do it.
I don’t feel a victim, this story is part of my past now.
I will not forget it, but I do not feel pity for myself.
My life continues.
I graduated from school this year and enrolled in the medical university in Vladikavkaz.
I’m going to study to become a cardiologist.
My first choice was to go to the army.
I wanted to go to the military, but my health did not allow it.
I wanted to fight for my country, but that won’t happen.
George Farneev, 20 years
The boy who survived despite being at the feet of the terrorist-killer
George Farniev was at the feet of the terrorist-killer during the seizure, but he still managed to survive.
During the capture, he was photographed in a sports hall sitting next to the bomb at the killer terrorist’s legs.
It was a miracle that he was not killed.
"It seems to us that it was yesterday," says Georgy, who wanted to study as an intelligence officer at the FSB but could not because of the damage that was caused to his health during the capture.
It’s still with me, it’s not something I’ve left behind.
I’m older now, and they say that children easily cope with bad events – I have to say that’s not true.
“I worked with psychologists in 2006 and I felt a little better after that, but I can’t forget that.
I would like to forget.
In 2005 - the following year - was the first and last time I entered this sports hall again.
I lost consciousness.
I would never go there again, and please don’t ask me to show where I was sitting on this famous photo.
Survivor: Georgy Farniev today with opened on the laptop photo of himself in the hospital after capture
My pain is huge and I carry it with me every day.
My friends know I don’t like to think about it or discuss it, and they’ve never asked me about school.
In terms of physical condition, I am healthy.
I need to be careful with the knee that has been damaged, but now I walk well.
But still my health did not allow me to go to the FSB Academy in St. Petersburg as I wanted.
I sent my documents, including medical statements, and they answered that it was impossible.
My second passion was animals, so I went to the veterinary institute.
I studied there for two years.
He learns to treat all animals “from cats to cows.”
He said, “I know I will never tell my children about my experience.
This is not something children should know about, and not something they should experience.
His mother, Marina, 42, said: “This pain never leaves me.
It’s worse in my soul as the anniversary approaches.
I will go and be present at the ceremonies that will be held to celebrate it.
I know that George will not go.
For him, she should be even stronger because he was there and I wasn’t.
I waited for him at home and could not help.
I am so grateful to God that he has come back to me.Here in Beslan, the footprint lies on everyone.
He remains with us.
George is now an adult, but that nightmare is still with him.
It’s hard to accept when something so terribly unfair happens to you.
He is a boy, he loves sports, but can’t do them because of his knee.
He has had several surgeries, he can walk, but can’t play sports.
I would say he overcame this nightmare by 50%, but it is impossible to overcome it completely and forget it.
This terrible experience will remain with us.
Many friends and neighbors were killed during the capture, and this only increases my pain.
I lost a lot of people I knew well and who were dear to me.
My son is with me, and this is the best gift God could give me, but my heart hurts for those who have been killed.
I know families where new children were born, but I know widows who never married again.
It’s hard to accept that life continues, even if you don’t want to.
I will never forget how my heart jumped out of my chest when I saw him in the hospital.
Now I look at what is happening in the world – wars in different regions.
Why are these people fighting for?
Why are they killing each other?
The war is very close to our country now, and I can hardly believe it.
We were a friendly country in the past, how did it happen that we are at war now?
People and children are suffering, I am sure, many children have already been killed in Ukraine and many will be killed.
If you could catch all the rebels and throw them as far away as possible.
Alena Tskaeva, 10 years
The baby who was touchingly taken to a safe place by a fighter of the special forces
Saved: Alain Tscheev is carried to a safe place by a Russian special forces fighter (left).
Now she is ten (right), and she doesn’t remember the monstrous crime at all.
The world stopped breathing in 2004 when the little Allona was taken out of the seized school in Beslan by a Russian police officer.
The terrorists released her, but brutally left her 30-year-old mother, 10-year-old sister Christina and brother Mahar in the gym.
Mahar, who was then three years old, survived, but Alonina's mother and sister died in a deadly slaughter.
Her father Ruslan has since married again, and they have a young daughter with his new wife Svetlana, whom he named Christina in memory of the daughter he lost.
Alona, who is now ten, remembers nothing of the capture and has grown into a smart and cheerful girl, neighbors say.
"They're a big happy family now, and Allena and Mahar are both wonderful children," says a close friend.
Ruslan is a wonderful father and wants to keep them away from all the memories when the 10th anniversary is celebrated.
You can understand why.
Midfielder Xinji Kagawa, who returned from Manchester United to Borussia Dortmund, said he was looking forward to being able to return to the field in the form of a German club.
According to him, this transfer is a joyful event in his career.
Of course, I am very happy to be playing for Borussia again,” said Kagawa.
I feel very well.
It’s full of positive emotions and I’m looking forward to coming out on the pitch again in the form of Borussia.
Kagawa moved to the United from Borussia in the summer of 2012 for 16 million euros.
However, he was never able to consolidate himself in the English club, having spent two seasons of only 38 matches in the championship of England, scoring 6 goals and giving 8 effective transfers.
Man accused of riding on a girl on a pedestrian crossing "pelican" in Fifa
A 78-year-old man will be brought before the court on charges of riding a three-year-old girl on the pedestrian crossing Pelikan in Fifa.
Gordon Stewart allegedly struck a girl on a crossing in Pittenville, East New York.
Prosecutors said Mr. Stewart was driving his Audi Q3 without due care and attention and shot the girl, resulting in her injury.
Stuart, 78, from Anstrut, denied his guilt in the Dundee Sheriff Court.
Sheriff Charles McNair, the royal lawyer, has set the date of the trial for January.
Obama, Merkel and Hollande will not be in Vladivostok
The duty-free trade store of Vladivostok airport has displayed a sign that prohibits a number of world political leaders from making purchases in this store.
Do not get them with perfumes, vodka and cognac.
The administration of the store decided that U.S. President Barack Obama, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, French President Francois Hollande, Vitaly Klitschko, Yulia Tymoshenko, Prime Minister of Japan and several other famous comrades will not be able to buy vodka, cognac and perfumes in their store.
He placed a corresponding sign on the door.
Earlier, Obama was banned from appearing in an institution even less accessible to him by the kind of service - Dietetic dining rooms of the Moscow State University, as by the website of catering establishments.
Whether the American president dreamed of ever eating in a dietary dining room in Russia is not known, but the authors of the prohibitions clearly seem to themselves terribly ingenious.
Is there cheese after the embargo: Medvedev gave advice to farmers
Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev believes that under the embargo, Russian farmers should master new technologies to establish the production of cheese varieties in demand from buyers.
The advice was given during a visit to the company "Yugpticeprom" of the company "Agrokomplex".
The head of government also advised restaurants to reorient to Russian meat, the quality of which is at the right level.
An annual embargo on food imports has been imposed in Russia since August 7.
Head coach of the Russian national team Valentine Maslakov is pleased with the results of the tournament DecaNation.
According to the expert, the third place is a good result given the lack of targeted preparation for the competition.
Our athletes have performed at their level, - cites "All sport" words Maslakov.
The third place is a confirmation of our high command level.
It is pleasant that the advantage of the French and even the Americans over us is minimal.
It should be noted that we were not preparing for these competitions.
The season is over and we are not obliging our leaders to participate in the DecaNation match.
In recent years we have become second in this tournament, but this season we have updated our team.
The French, on the contrary, exhibited a combat capable team, including 13 European champions.
They did not hide their intention to win this year, which they have repeatedly announced publicly.
But even such a composition of the hosts of the competition could not resist the Americans.
Therefore, I believe that the Russians performed in such a representative company at a good level.
But the results in some categories were in order lower than in the same "Diamond League".
The season finished.
Of course, athletes are not so important to the outcome, especially in team level competitions.
The main thing here was the place.
And according to the results, I agree, it was absurd when at 1500 m men were so fascinated by tactical tricks of running that they showed a result below the average level... women’s races.
4 tips on how to the best quality of underwater photos and videos
If you want to photograph or film underwater, there are a number of equipment options.
The cheapest option is a waterproof soap, such as the Nikon Coolpix AW120, or an action camera, such as the GoPro Hero3+ Silver Edition, both of which are sold for about $300.
I took these photos on a family holiday with several cameras, all at a cost of about $350.
Regardless of the equipment you use, there are a few rules to follow in order to the best results.
Check your equipment.
Even if you have a waterproof camera, make sure that the camera’s battery and other compartments are tightly closed.
Additionally, adjust your camera for the type of photos or videos you are going to take.
Some camera and video cameras have shooting modes or object type that optimize exposure for darkened underwater conditions.
And before jumping into the water, figure out how deep your equipment can descend.
Some cameras are designed for just 5 feet, others for 50 or 60 feet.
Check out our buyer guide and digital camera ratings for both traditional and waterproof models.
Take a few shots – because many of them won’t work.
Soaphouses have LCDs that will help you assemble photos, while action cameras usually don’t.
Even if you have a LCD, it will be difficult to see underwater, and setting up the frame will be a random process.
Make a few cadres.
Also, if your camera has a serial shooting mode that captures several frames with slightly different exposure settings, use it.
Stay at the surface.
The amount of light decreases significantly the deeper you dive underwater.
If possible, stay on the surface when shooting in a pool, river or ocean.
It will also allow you to convey more colors on photos; the deeper you go, the less colors you will see.
Swim closer to the objects.
This is a great tip for shooting on land, but it’s even more important underwater due to dark light conditions.
Especially important if you’re shooting on an action camera: This equipment is often fitted with a fixed, wide-angle lens, which means you’ll have to approach the objects of the shooting if you want to fill the frame.
The bronze prize-winner of the 2012 Olympic Games in free struggle Bilal Machov may move to the Greco-Roman struggle.
This was announced by the head coach of the national team of Dagestan on free struggle Sagid Sagidov.
The specialist did not rule out the participation of the athlete at the world championship in Tashkent in September 2014.
At present, Bilal Machov is on the collection of the team of "classics", - cites "R-Sport" the words of Sadjidov.
In general, on juniors Bilal performed in both styles.
At the youth world championship in 2005, he became the winner of the Volnish tournament and the third prize winner in the Greco-Roman competitions and decided to concentrate on the free struggle.
It has long been said that a new stage of his career our heavyweight will spend in the Greco-Roman struggle.
I will say more: Mahov can perform already at the world championship in Tashkent - if he wins a pitch.
But the decisive word is always behind the coach staff headed by Gogi Koguashvili.
Andrew Lawson was such a man whose power of personality could shake everything around, even in such a giant organization as the National Health Service.
A consulting anesthesiologist, he dedicated his career to relieving patients from both the suffering of the disease and the pain of treatment.
Among those who addressed him, his wife recalls, was an MI6 officer who had to live with the devastating consequences of torture.
Lawson understood that while doctors are passionate about diagnoses and diseases, those undergoing treatment are mostly concerned about something entirely different – pain.
Once in 2007, however, he turned out to be the one who began to suffer.
“I didn’t feel like usual,” he wrote in May last year.
It was hard for me to find strength.
Fighting with flu-like symptoms, he found that he irritably blamed his wife, Juliet.
“I want it to happen sooner, not later,” he said.
When Juliet left for business for a week, Lawson found that he was unusual and unclear why upset.
Something was wrong.
He asked a colleague to take a chest X-ray.
Only two weeks earlier he was skiing in the French Alps.
The X-ray results have arrived.
It was mesothelioma, an incurable cancer that affects the pleura, or lungs.
For most cancers, it is difficult to find out the exact cause.
Although some smokers get lung cancer, for example, not all lung cancer patients smoked.
But with mesothelioma differently.
In almost all cases, the cause is the contact with asbestos, a fiber-shaped building material that was once called a "miracle", but which is now known to be deadly.
For most of us, mesothelioma is a disease that can be ignored.
Asbestos, after all, is a material from the past.
The most dangerous type of asbestos has not been used in the UK since the 1960s, when a recommended industrial ban came into force.
Even when it was used, only people from specific industries worked in close contact with it: pipe insulators, builders, carpenters and dock workers, for example.
An industrial toxin from another era, it is hardly seen as a cause for concern today.
This calm is wrong.
Britain, it turns out, is today at the peak of the mesothelioma epidemic.
More people die from mesothelioma here than in any other country on the planet.
With an annual death rate of approximately 2,500 people, more than twice as many people die from this disease than from car accidents.
Annual deaths from mesothelioma since 1980 and forecast future deaths in the UK
The reason we are feeling its deadly consequences now is that while the use of asbestos has been illegal for many years (all types of asbestos were eventually banned by law in 1999), it usually takes tens of years to develop mesothelioma.
And attacking mesotheliomes is not limited to veterans of industrial construction specialties.
Asbestos has been, and in many cases remains, placed in the houses where we live, the offices where we work, the schools where we study, and the shops where we go shopping.
As a result, mesothelioma does not pay attention to class, level of wealth, profession or age.
The bastions of the elect, from fashionable London supermarkets to private schools, turned out to be not the salvation.
The parliamentary building is filled with asbestos.
Even the hospitals that are intended to treat us have turned out to be reservoirs of this deadly carcinogen.
Andrew Lawson was not old.
He was not a tube insulator.
In fact, he had to think about where he could come into contact with asbestos.
Then he understood.
"It seems that there may have been a lot of asbestos in the tunnels at the Gaia Hospital where I spent six years on an internship," he wrote.
Everyone—students, nurses, doctors, and truckers—used these tunnels.
I wonder how many of my peers will get the same disease?
This was a question to which, unfortunately, he could give a partial answer.
“Of the four doctors who have trained at Gaia Hospital and subsequently developed mesothelioma over the past five years,” he noted in a letter in 2010, “I am the only one who has survived.”
How many of us will suffer from this disease?
Andrew Lawson was diagnosed with mesothelioma when he was 48.
When he died on February 17, he was 55.
Living so long is unusual.
Fifty percent of patients with mesothelioma die 8 months after diagnosis.
It is always deadly.
So now we can only repeat Lawson’s question, “How many of us will get the same disease?”
According to the leading expert on mesothelioma in the UK, Professor Julian Pito, it is most likely to suggest that between 1970 and 2050, when the asbestos epidemic in the UK is due to survive, about 90,000 people will die.
Most people don’t think they’re going to die that way.

A quick look at reports from court halls, where victims often seek compensation, shows how far the mesothelioma attack has spread.
In June, for example, Marks & Spencer admitted that they had inadvertently exposed Jenny Allen to asbestos.
She worked in the network for nine years, from 1978 to 1987, leading the clothing departments at two facilities, one of which was the main store on Oxford Street.
Mrs. Ellen was only 18 when she started working for M&S.
She now has two children over 20 years old.
“Before it happened,” she says, “I never heard of mesothelioma, I barely knew about asbestos.
I couldn’t think it would affect me.
Few people really know a lot about asbestos.
Asbestos is not a single substance, but a group of six minerals.
They get their name from the word asbestos, which means a fiber-shaped structure that gives them strength and flexibility.
Of these six, three were often used in construction.
Chrysotyl, widely known as white asbestos, is much more common in buildings today.
It was used in roof panels, floor tiles, heat insulation of pipes, boiler seams, even in brake pads of cars.
It is less lethal than other forms of asbestos, but is still recognized by the European Union and the World Health Organization as a “serious source of health damage” that can lead to death.
More dangerous, however, is brown asbestos (amosite) and blue asbestos (crocodylite).
Britain was once the world’s largest importer of brown asbestos, and experts suggest that “there are strong, though indirect, grounds to believe that this is the primary cause of the exceptionally high number of patients with mesothelioma [in the UK].”

Jenny Allen may not have thought of herself as a typical mesothelioma victim, but the work of Julian Pito suggests that her story is far from unusual.
He conducted a study of patients, which suggests that “a significant percentage of mesotheliomas, when no known exposure at work or at home, were most likely caused by exposure to asbestos from the environment.”
Most of this exposure, he says, is due to “ordinary use and weather effects” on our buildings.
No one seems to be sure that he is safe.
The Goddard Consulting report, which looked at the Westminster Palace, demonstrates how people, even in the very center of the government, could be exposed unconsciously.
In 2009, Goddard that technical mines and pipelines outside parliamentary committees were contaminated with asbestos, the deadly fibers of which could be driven by something as harmless as “strong air flows.”
Members of parliament are often accused of pursuing their own interests, but in this case it seems to be the opposite.
Although the Parliament's Department of Maintenance insisted that the Westminster Palace had been granted a "pure sanitary certificate", it now acknowledged that £1 billion of work was needed to rebuild the parliament by improving electricity and removing asbestos, and that after the 2015 general elections, members of parliament may be sitting in the nearby QE2 conference center, rather than on Westminster's green benches.
The Goddard report noted that “the asbestos situation was not managed in accordance with different rules.”
It is impossible to know if this management mistake will cost lives.
All you can do now is wait.
One of those who has never been able to identify their contact with asbestos is Graham Abbott, a general practitioner.
Like Andrew Lawson, Abbott, 50, suspects that he was exposed to asbestos while working in hospitals.
“I worked in a hospital where asbestos-related lawsuits were successfully filed,” he says, “But I can’t prove that in my case.
It is so hard to remember all the places where I worked and the dates.
What he remembers clearly is the day in early December 2009 when he was struck by something that looked like a flu.
He was 45, and he was in the middle of the operation late in the evening.
Suddenly I began to get fever.
It started very quickly.
I felt terrible.
I thought I’t be able to go all the way home.
As a doctor, Abbott knew that the pain came from the pleura, the shell around the lungs.
However, like Jenny Allen, he simply had no reason to suspect mesothelioma.
Eventually, he could not go to work for a month.
Confused doctors took X-rays of the chest and placed pleural catheters to pull out the fluid from the lungs and send it for testing.
His condition remained undiagnosed.
Gradually his health improved and he returned to work.
But from time to time, the same symptoms returned, often after he was sporting and breathing hard.
In 2011, one of Abbott’s patients came to him with similar symptoms, and he was subsequently diagnosed with mesothelioma.
However, even then, Abbott did not link this to his own case.
Eventually, his patient was tens of years older and worked with asbestos directly.
The connection in this case was obvious.
In September 2011, Abbott's condition deteriorated again, and the doctor who consulted him showed his CT results and X-rays to a team of specialists.
In December 2011, exactly two years after Abbott began feeling ill, a camera-equipped sensor was inserted into the cavity between his chest shell and his lung shell.
I am an optimist.
I usually just go further,” he says.
I wasn’t too worried about it, to be honest.
But Rachel, my wife, was worried.
The results of the biopsy came in the week between Christmas and New Year: “I was told it was a mesothelioma.”
Graham Abbott diagnosed with mesothelioma
Suddenly, Abbott plunged into a meeting with the Macmillan nurses, one of whom offered him to contact a lawyer.
It was then that he realized the extent of the epidemic.
“It turns out asbestos has been widely used, especially in large public buildings, where asbestos thermal insulation on pipes was quite common,” he says.
People who have been exposed to asbestos in these buildings are now getting sick with this disease.
Thus, mesothelioma now affects younger people of atypical professions.
The most dangerous asbestos-insulated pipes in hospitals were in basements, so patients are unlikely to be affected.
But many employees who walked through pedestrian tunnels to get from one building to another (like Andrew Lawson) or ate in basement dining rooms (as Graham Abbott often did) were almost actually exposed to the toxic substance.
For decades after the war, it turns out, hospitals were the place where, in theory, they saved lives for patients, but a place that posed a life-threatening threat to the doctors who treated them.
It is still being removed today.
Schoolchildren installed their Bunzen burners on asbestos pads
It’s not just hospitals.
Asbestos has been widely used in offices, shops, libraries and town halls because of its surprising insulation and fire-resistant characteristics.
The schools too.
In fact, many were most likely exposed to asbestos for the first time in class.
Thro the country, at countless chemistry lessons, schoolchildren installed their Bunzen burners on asbestos pads.
There are websites that focus on the problem of asbestos in schools.
Meanwhile, in our homes, harmless things such as floor tiles or roofs, usually contained asbestos.
“It’s an industrial poison in a huge number of our buildings,” says Andrew Morgan, a lawyer who represented Andrew Lawson in the case against Guy’s Hospital.
In one case, the only contact a sick woman could remember was the demolition of a garden sarai in the 1970s.
Therefore, be careful when wearing gardens.
The effect of diagnosis, when it is known that the disease is incurable, is huge.
“It takes a lot of time to realize this,” says Graham Abbott.
I went back to work and tried to keep going, but I realized I couldn’t focus on what I was doing.
I was on surgery for two weeks.
Then I realized I had to leave and deal with myself.
I will never see Christmas again.
One of the most difficult things was the transition from the position of the doctor to the position of the patient.
Like countless patients before him, he remembers how confused he was by the amount of information he had to receive.
“It was hard to realize everything,” he says.
I asked my doctor, “How much time do I have?”
I got about 12 months.
I remember thinking, “Well, I won’t see Christmas anymore.
That is all.”
Mesothelioma is dangerous because it is the mechanics of how we sustain life – the act of breathing itself – that causes cancer that kills.
Most cases of mesothelioma are caused by contact with asbestos.
Asbestos is made up of tiny fibers.
When asbestos is destroyed and fibers are inhaled, they can get stuck in the pleura, the lungs.
Asbestos fibers irritate the pleura and can cause cell mutations.
“The problem arises due to the inhalation of needle-shaped asbestos fibers,” said Professor Tom Treger, a cardiovascular surgeon who came to Gaia Hospital in 2001.
It was the hospital where, as Andrew Lawson suspected, he was exposed to asbestos, now, ironically, the leading center for mesothelioma treatment.
Treyer knew Lawson and treated some others who were likely exposed while internshiping in the hospital.
When asbestos needles get into the lung tissue, Treger says, “they are pushed out to the periphery where the shell is.
This is, in essence, an invasive process from the beginning.
Conventional treatment options for other cancers are much less effective for mesothelioma.
The effectiveness of surgical intervention, for example, causes hot disputes.
Some think it is worth trying.
Trevor does not agree.
“It’s impossible to cut off the pleura,” he says.
It is impossible to approach her with a knife.
Meanwhile, this cancer “is not very well suited to chemotherapy,” which “works” but does not cure.
“Sometimes there are sick people who live a long life,” says Treger.
In the end, they all die.
Fortunately, some patients live much, much longer than expected.
Writer Steven J. Gould died 20 years after being diagnosed.
Two and a half years after the diagnosis, Graham Abbott continues to fight.
After he became ill with mesothelioma, Abbott was introduced to Andrew Lawson, who, four years after the diagnosis, became a support and counseling office for the same patients.
“Allo, Cancer Central,” he said joyfully when they called.
“He was very positive,” says Abbott.
He was diagnosed 4 years ago and is still very energetic.
Initially, Abbott was offered six cycles of chemotherapy, which would take four months and extend his life by just one month.
“I was in despair,” he says.
I wanted to surrender.
Lawson, however, “has tricked to give everything a slightly more positive color.”
After meeting several specialists, Abbott decided to continue treatment with Professor Loik Lang-Lazunsky, a professor of thoracic surgery at Gaia Hospital.
“We had the advantage that I didn’t need directions, I just called them and they took me,” Graham admits.
The average patient would have to get a direction and approval for funding.
Money plays a crucial role for patients with mesothelioma to get the best treatment available.
However, when such treatment eventually turns out to be ineffective, many patients face another financial cause of concern – the future of the families they will leave.
Then they go to the courts for compensation.
Andrew Lawson contacted Andrew Morgan of Field Fisher Waterhouse LLP.
“It has been known that asbestos has been harmful to health since 1898,” Morgan says.
But what changed in the 1960s is that it became clear that even very small amounts could put health at risk.
It was then that we talked about the dishonesty of companies.
Andrew Lawson and Guy's Hospital eventually settled the case, but it wasn't a "full-cost settlement," Morgan said, as Lawson was unable to unambiguously prove that his mesothelioma was the result of contact with asbestos at Guy's Hospital.
After investigating his death, a spokesman for the Gaia Hospital confirmed, however, that “asbestos in the basement rooms in question was removed in the 1990s.”
It was too late for Andrew Lawson.
How to remove asbestos
In fact, linking deadly contact with asbestos to one company or workplace—usually decades after that—has proved to be a big problem for mesothelioma patients demanding compensation.
Many of their former employers have changed owners or closed.
The insurance records may have been lost.
And those who defend themselves against lawsuits know that the time is on their side, which the plaintiffs do not have.
In response, this year, serious new legislation came out that makes it easier for patients with mesothelioma to recover compensation, even if their former employers cannot be tracked.
Under this law, a £350 million fund, funded by the insurance industry, was created for those who were diagnosed after July 2012 and who can prove contact but who has no one to sue.
In such cases, the patients will receive 80 percent of the amount that the court could have awarded in the ordinary case of compensation — about £1,20000.
About 300 successful lawsuits under this scheme are expected each year.
Andrew Morgan, like many who work with patients with mesothelioma, believes that £350 million represents a “very good job” for the insurance industry.
“This is a deal written by insurers for insurers,” he says, hinting that the amount is a quarter of what insurers would have had to pay if the time frame had not intervened and patients with mesothelioma could track the companies and file a lawsuit in the usual way.
Even Mike Penning, former Labour and Pension Minister, has admitted that the law is “imperfect.”
However, both Penning and Morgan acknowledge that while seven people die every day, quick action was necessary.
“People are suffering so much and they need help today,” Penning said during Bill’s second reading on mesothelioma last December.
At that time, Graham Abbott was in the hands of Professor Loik Lang-Lazunsky for 19 months.
After initial consultations, Lange-Lazunsky recommended surgical intervention, which, unlike Tom Trezer, he considered effective.
This was followed by radiation therapy and chemotherapy - triterapy, in which Lange-Lazunsky boasts as much as 40 percent of surviving patients in five years.
Abbott felt a flood of strength.
“That’s, of course, one of the most important things,” says Abbott.
You see this in patients all the time.
There is a force that supports you.
When you give up, the condition can get worse very quickly.
Graham Abbott underwent an operation in March 2012.
By the end of August, he had completed the last of six cycles of chemotherapy.
Subsequent scans showed no trace of the disease.
Then I was scanned in March [2014].
There were a few spots [cancer] in my chest.
I should have just turned 50.
It is not a threat to life.
This is the end of life.
And again, Abbott went through six cycles of chemotherapy.
There is no trace of tumors.
However, this process is both physically and emotionally difficult.
You can think about practical things - about finances when I die, for example, or about what to show my wife how the timer works on the boiler.
When you get bad news, you become unhappy.
You have to look forward.
As the father of Ellie, 16, and Tamzin, 14, it’s not always easy.
“It’s hard for parents,” he says.
It’s hard to know what to say and how much to say.
When I was first diagnosed, I told the girls that I had a disease that meant I’t live to old age.
They reacted very differently.
Tamzin is very sociable and energetic.
She told all of her friends, and many of us called very quickly.
Ellie was more restrained.
She did not say much.
Such conversations are something that every cancer patient has to face.
But for patients with mesothelioma, such discussions are not balanced with hope, even a glimpse of the possibility of survival.
This disease brings with it (even, in the end, for Stephen Jay Gould) a dark certainty.
As Andrew Morgan says, “Mezotelioma is not a threat to life.
The bodies of the pharaohs are wrapped in asbestos fabrics.
Asbestos fibers are used to strengthen pots and increase heat resistance.
Pliny the Elder describes asbestos.
Now a canvas has been invented that does not burn.
I saw the wipes made of it melting in the fireplaces on banquets.
Modern commercial use of asbestos begins in Italy, where it is used to make paper (even banknotes) and fabrics.
Large asbestos mines are being opened in Canada and South Africa and soon thereafter in America, Italy and Russia.
It is the perfect heat insulator for steam engines and turbines of the Industrial Revolution.
World asbestos production is growing to more than 30,000 tons per year.
Statistics from Prudential reveal premature mortality among those who work with asbestos and who are consequently denied life insurance.
Nelly Kershaw dies in Rochdale.
Dr. William Cook testifies that asbestos particles in her lungs “were, beyond any doubt, the primary cause of death.”
This is the first case of this type.
The employers of Kershaw, Turner Bros Asbestos, do not accept responsibility.
Compensation is not paid.
During World War II, shipbuilding, one of the deadliest professions in terms of contact with asbestos, developed intensively.
Voluntary industrial ban on imports of blue asbestos
The Court of Appeal confirms the first successful lawsuit for harm to health caused by contact with asbestos in the UK.
World asbestos production grows to more than 4213,000 tons per year.
The UK imports 139,000 tons.
The UK’s Executive Committee on Health and Industrial Safety requires all contractors working with asbestos to obtain a license.
The import and use of blue and brown asbestos is prohibited by law in the UK.
Asbestos is banned in the UK.
The Mesothelioma Act was adopted in the United Kingdom.
Compensation scheme of £350 million has been announced.
Asbestos is banned in more than 50 countries, but white asbestos is still used in cheap building materials in many parts of the world.
World production remains at about 2 million tons per year.
China refuses to give Hong Kong the right to elect leaders; protesters vow to take revenge
The Chinese parliament on Sunday decided not to allow Hong Kong voters to nominate candidates for the 2017 elections, despite growing demands for democratic reform.
This move is likely to set off long-promised protests in Hong Kong’s business district as activists began planning and mobilizing hours after the announcement.
The decision of the All-China People’s Assembly, in essence, allows communist leaders to remove all candidates who are not loyal to Beijing.
"This hasn't deceived our expectations, but it's still provoking anger," said lawmaker Emily Lau, chairman of the Democratic Party.
This is not what Beijing promised.
They deceived the people of Hong Kong.
And obviously we are dealing with an authoritarian regime.
Defending China’s decision, Li Fei, deputy secretary general of the Permanent Committee of the All-China People’s Assembly, said it would be too “chaotic” to allow a popular nomination for a Hong Kong leader.
Since 1997, when the UK transferred control of Hong Kong back to China, Beijing has promised to allow residents of the region to elect the head of government by voting, starting in 2017.
Chinese leaders presented Sunday’s decision as a democratic step forward as it gives Hong Kongers the right to vote directly; however, the decision also makes it clear that Chinese leaders will continue to hold the process firmly in their hands with the help of a candidate nomination commission tightly controlled from Beijing.
And, according to the new article, only candidates who “love the country and love Hong Kong” will be admitted.
The decision was made after the summer, when there were some of the largest and most widely popular protests in Hong Kong in many years.
Much of the pro-democracy campaign in Hong Kong is behind the Occupy Central With Love and Peace movement, whose organizers have threatened to shut down Hong Kong’s financial district if Beijing does not guarantee the actual universal right to vote.
On Sunday evening, hours after the announcement, hundreds of Occupy Central supporters gathered in the rain outside the Hong Kong government headquarters.
At the demonstration, the organizers said their movement was moving into a new phase of civil disobedience and that they would rise on the waves of protest in the coming weeks.
However, they did not disclose details, apparently in an effort to avoid problems with government agencies.
In an online statement, the organizers that the movement "was considering capturing the central area only as an exceptional measure, action that can only be taken if all opportunities for dialogue are exhausted and there is no other choice.
We regret to announce that all opportunities for dialogue are now exhausted and the capture of the central area will undoubtedly take place.
Government authorities in Hong Kong have been preparing for the Beijing statement for several days, and on Sunday, security measures were tightened at the government headquarters involving police and barricades.
At the heart of the riots is the feeling that many in Hong Kong are slowly losing control of their own city.
The influx of people from the mainland increases competition in the field of goods and services.
Fears are also growing that Hong Kong’s values, such as democracy and freedom of speech, are beginning to weaken under increasing pressure from Beijing.
Some have criticized the Occupy Central movement, saying its demonstrations are putting business at risk – Hong Kong’s vitality source.
“The protest they’re talking about can lead to great economic damage depending on how many people will participate and for how long,” said lawmaker Regina Ip, who has long criticized the movement.
We do not want to spread concerns that Hong Kong is out of control.
This is a view that is detrimental to investment.
Chinese state media has also in recent days that Hong Kong democratic activists have been shown as saboteurs led by Western powers.
This summer, activists organized an unofficial referendum on the right to vote, which attracted 780,000 participants – more than one-fifth of Hong Kong’s voters.
In July, tens of thousands took part in one of the largest pro-democracy demonstrations in the region’s history.
American culture of graduation balls reaches university life: first-year students offered to arrive on a personal plane
We are delighted to respond to this demand by launching the UK’s first luxury travel service for current students.
To leave a bright impression of arriving at the university, the company also offers such transport options as a personal plane, a Rolls-Royce Phantom, an Aston Martin or a McLaren P1.
Mr. Stewart also said the service was thinking about security.
This service is an ideal alternative for students who usually have to carry their things across the country in a dangerously overloaded car.
Combined with our new options for VIF, we look forward to helping students this year get to the university with minimal effort and maximum luxury.
A spokesman for the company said that since the service was just launched, there were no orders yet, but added that "students will start ordering this service in the next few weeks."
The company also said that despite the fact that students have to pay £9,000 a year, it still hopes to find a market for this service.
Current students are quite different from students 10, 20, 30 or 40 years ago in terms of expectations and hopes: it’s more important than ever to make a great first impression, and VIF is exactly what it takes for it.
Nevertheless, the National Student Union has criticized this service as detached from reality.
Megan Dunn, NSS Vice President for Higher Education, said: “This project seems incredibly detached from the lives of most students.
Many students who start college this month are faced with a cost of living crisis when affordable financial support in the form of loans and grants fails to catch up with the fast-growing costs of basic needs before they may even start thinking about taking out thousands of pounds on something like simply arriving in a dormitory.
Feminists raise racial issues and police behavior after Ferguson
An unarmed teenager was killed by a police officer in Ferguson, Missouri, earlier this month.
They raised their hands, shouting, “Hands up, don’t shoot,” while they were waiting in line for the funeral.
After two weeks of protests in Ferguson, Missouri, linked to the murder of unarmed teenager Michael Brown, blogger Miriam Zoila Perez noticed a shift in online conversation among white feminists.
In her experience, white feminists who commented placed gender above race when it came to promoting reproductive rights and income inequality.
However, as tensions grew in the Middle West and attracted national attention, Perez saw responses from white women who concentrated 100 percent on race.
Compared to the reaction of black women shortly after the August 9 murder, personal essays with titles such as “thoughts about Ferguson from the face of a white woman” and “Feminism is not just about women’s oppression” appeared relatively late.
But for Perez, they showed a significant shift.
“In feminism, I don’t think there are a lot of people who talk about white skin color and privileges at such a high level,” she said.
People felt the need to say something about what happened.
This is very symbolic of the crisis we have faced, and because (the situation in Ferguson) is so attached to race, they felt that it needed to be pointed out.
For Professor of English at Ohio State University Coryta, Mitchell Ferguson exposed the challenges black Americans face every day, but are not perceived as “female problems” in the cultural sphere.
“I can post something funny on Facebook about what’s happening to me and my partner, and I’ll get 150 likes from everywhere,” says Mitchell.
When I write something about how colored people are being attacked in their own country, the silence is silent.
"Why is it safe for women to talk publicly about relationships, but not about safety in the public sphere?" she asks.
For black women like Mitchell, who have studied issues of race, gender and sexuality in U.S. history, there is no dichotomy between issues of race and gender.
From her point of view, black women are in a position to clearly share these problems; they face a complex reality every day.
While white women are now combining racial and gender issues in the feminist mainstream, Angela Hattery, a professor of women’s and gender studies at George Mason University, says their predecessors did the opposite.
"Between 1865 and 1890, at least 10,000 black men were lynched, and the basis for this was almost always the rape of a white woman," said Hattery.
A white woman was needed to confirm the story to justify the lynching.
From Hatter's point of view, the gap between white and black women occurred when white suffragists such as Susan B. Anthony studied the situation in the late 1800s and saw that the struggle for voting rights would only be effective for one group: women or blacks.
“They decided to put all the eggs in the basket for women’s voting rights, and the voting rights for blacks should have appeared later,” she said.
Looking back on such things gives us a clear idea of why colored women don’t trust white women.
We did nothing good.
We have never helped black women protect their husbands and sons.
Even after women gained the right to vote in 1920, it took ten years for white women to unite against lynching into the Southern Women’s Association for the Prevention of Lynching.
This group appeared almost 40 years after black women first asked for help, Mitchell said.
From Mitchell’s point of view, the rise in white feminist reactions to the problems raised by the situation in Ferguson—police behavior, racial discrimination—reflects a time when white feminists had to catch up with the problems that black women faced over generations.
“Would it be great if activists who have such a [traditional feminist] ideology would take the right to raise a child as seriously as they do the right to contraception?” asked Mitchell.
Second wave feminists who have made careers fighting for reproductive rights and access to contraceptives are now beginning to understand what this means.
Famous white feminist activist Gloria Steinem, two weeks after the murder of Michael Brown, took advantage of Facebook and posted a sharp article by Guardian columnist Rebecca Carroll, which called for white Americans to take more part in racist protests.
“I hope that women who have a different but similar reason to understand the danger that lies in the body – and views on racial issues that differ significantly in public polls – will be at the forefront of the change,” Steinem wrote.
Though Steinem pledges a more intersecting feminism that includes both racial and gender issues, her commentary on race in America still surprises some.
American Entrepreneurship Institute researcher Christina Somers, author of “Who Stole Feminism?”, told She The People that young men in the United States, especially colorful young people, are “much more vulnerable than their sisters,” but Steinem’s reminders about Ferguson contradict the criticism she has expressed earlier.
Now we have hundreds of special programs for girls and young women, but almost nothing for boys.
However, when the White House recently launched a small program, “Watch My Brother,” to help vulnerable black and Spanish-speaking youths, there was an angry reaction from many feminists, including Gloria Steinem.
The police relationship with the black community is not the only issue promoting the forefront of traditional feminism.
After the U.S. Border Service arrested about 63,000 unaccompanied minors on the country’s southwestern border this year, immigration reform has come to the surface again – this time as a women’s problem.
Andrea Mercado, co-chair of We Belong Together, an organization that mobilizes women in support of immigration reform, said that in order to present the issue as important for women, she just needed to share the stories of women immigrants.
“They’re talking for themselves,” said Mercado.
When the vast majority of work visas are issued to [male immigrants], women who come with them find themselves in a position vulnerable to domestic violence and exploitation.
“These stories find a response from women’s organizations,” she said.
Ipswich house with a pig is for sale
A photo of a house for sale in Suffolk was removed by real estate agents when it turned out to be depicting a large pig resting in the living room.
Sold for £12,000, a single-bedroom house stands on a private road in Ipswich.
The detailed description was a photo of the living room of the house - which was depicted a pig with a head resting on the couch.
Property agency Connells that the pig in the photo is the homeowner’s pet.
"H, the photo was posted by mistake and has already been removed," a spokesman for the company said.
In a detailed description of the house, Connells described the former house of assembly as "a unique one-bedroom separate house."
Despite the fact that the agency removed the photo from its website, it is still preserved in advertising materials.
The sale of the house sparked interest in social media, where some asked if a pig was sold along with the house.
Russian tennis player Maria Sharapova, in the match of the fourth round of the U.S. Open surpassed Karolin Wozniacki, believes that she lacks stability.
According to the athlete, she wants to end the year with dignity and try to get to a new level, reports Vasily Osipov from New York.
How do you generally assess your results at this year’s Grand Slam tournament?
I am glad to have won Roland Garros.
As for the other three tournaments, I was not stable enough, especially at the end of some matches.
Now I am obviously upset.
I couldn’t even get to the quarterfinals.
What objectives do you have before the end of the season?
After an offensive defeat, I have a huge motivation to get to a new level.
I have a lot of work to do and I’m going to do everything I can to end the year with dignity.
The Asian tournament series begins in a few weeks.
Member of the State Duma Committee on Physical Culture, Sports and Youth Affairs, former world champion Nikolai Valuev proposed to give bonuses when entering universities for the performance of GTO norms.
According to him, in general, the norms will be the same as in Soviet times - people will pass the norms on pulling, running and other exercises.
12 subjects of Russia will start implementing GTO norms on their territory from 1 September.
Also, I offered schoolchildren who passed the GTO to give bonuses when entering universities, - Valuev noted.
For example, they can add a little points to the EGE.
There are also proposals to give an additional vacation to employees of enterprises that have passed these sports tests.
In the city of Harvey, South Wales, a new millionaire appeared after winning a lottery
A lottery player from Harvey this month.
A new millionaire is being sought southwest of Perth, where one lucky man will take home $1.1 million from a lottery draw on Saturday night.
A newspaper kiosk in Harvey brings gold in the main prize draw for the second time in five years, last winning $1 million in November 2009.
However, the successful winner still needs to declare himself.
Shop owner Steve Forward said the win caused an agitation in a small town southwest of Perth.
The whole city is talking about it, and everyone is very excited.
We thought that such a win could be a secret.
Eight winners from Western Australia celebrated winning the main prize last month, marking the conclusion of several successful weeks for state players.
Last week, the Canning Weal player became one of the five millionaires in August, following a huge $7.5 million win from the Belmont pair just weeks before.
The winning couple has been playing for twenty years and said the win gave them the opportunity to travel the world and buy a new home.
A millionaire from Harvey brings the number of winners of the main prize in Western Australia to 59 this year, with a total winning $85 million.
The Ministry of Economic Development wants to accelerate the growth of the electric car market
This week, the Ministry of Economic Development will submit to the government a comprehensive plan for the development of eco-friendly transport in Russia, said Deputy Director of the Department of the Ministry Oleg Pluzhnikov at the round table held by Vedomosti at the Moscow Auto Show 2014.
The plan is drafted on behalf of the government, one of the main objectives is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
It is expected that the document will be adopted in late September - early October, says Pluzhnikov, the proposed measures concern electric vehicles and hybrids - a plan for the development of gas-fuel vehicles in Russia already exists.
The plan (a copy is available at "Vedomosti") is designed for 2014-2017.
Criteria for the assessment of electric and hybrid transport must be developed and how to stimulate the use and production of eco-friendly vehicles.
A report to the government describing tax and customs support measures for electric transport will be prepared by December 2014; a preferential lending and preferential leasing scheme will appear by April 2015; and proposals for lowering the price of cars, stimulating localization and building service infrastructure will be developed by October 2015.
In 2014-2015, it is planned to make changes to regulatory acts to facilitate the conditions for the construction of charging infrastructure (at parking lots, gas stations, etc.).
In addition, federal officials intend to formulate proposals for regional authorities during 2015 to also encourage the use of eco-friendly transport – in the form of giving it an advantage in traffic and parking, for example; and by February 2016 – and proposals on expanding public procurement of such transport.
Finally, by October 2014, the Ministry of Economic Development will include in the list of indicators for assessing the activities of regional authorities criteria reflecting the effectiveness of supporting the production of ecologically clean transport and the development of charging infrastructure.
The electric car market in Russia is just forming - in 2013 around 100 electric vehicles were sold across the country.
At the beginning of 2014 zero import duty on electric vehicles, so sales will be about 500 units, predicts Mitsubishi Motors chief executive officer in Russia Andrei Pankov.
But the five-fold growth does not make electric cars any noticeable: in 2013 in Russia, according to the Association of European Business, sold 2.78 million passenger cars and light commercial vehicles.
For now, only Mitsubishi Motors imports electric cars to Russia.
Renault is preparing to start imports – the company focuses primarily on corporate customers, says Nicola Remiz, Director of Strategic Planning and Partnerships of Renault in Russia.
Most other electric transport manufacturers have taken a stand-by position towards Russia.
Developments of electric vehicles are also in Russian manufacturers - "", GAZ, "", but the output is miserable.
For example, in January-July 2014, according to the "ASM-holding", "AutoVAZ" produced 30 electric vehicles.
Demand is low due to the cost of electric vehicles, acknowledges the director of "AutoVAZ" engineering Sergey Amanov, without state support the breakthrough in this segment will not be.
The development of the Russian electric vehicle market in addition to the cost of cars (those electric cars sold in Russia are on average twice as expensive as analogues with internal combustion engines) contains the underdevelopment of charging infrastructure (fuels - units), says General Director of "AutoStata" Sergey Celikov.
Due to the cost and low rates of cost decrease, electric cars in the next 3-4 years will remain a niche segment of the Russian market, forecasts the editor-in-chief of "Autorevy" Mikhail Podorozhansky, Celikov agrees with him.
Automotive manufacturers, on the contrary, say that some models of electric cars are already close to the cost of conventional cars.
The Russian electric car market has good prospects, the main thing is to instill confidence in consumers that "electromobility" is real; this, in particular, will contribute to the emergence of new charging stations, emphasizes the president of the BMW Group in Russia Wolfgang Schlime.
Such infrastructure projects are implemented, for example, by the state company "Rosseti": several stations have been built in Moscow, soon there will be about 80 more.
Negotiations on the construction of the gas network are also being conducted with other regions.
According to the director of the department "Rosnety" Vladimir Sophyn, the company believes in the market of electric vehicles and is ready to build gas stations across the country, but there are also problems: a small number of electric vehicles in the country and the lack of a single standard for charging electric vehicles of different brands.
In addition, "Rosetti" as a network company does not have the right to deal with the sale of electricity, the possibility of doing so in relation to charging electric vehicles is being worked out.
Pankov believes that the most effective measure of state support for the formation of the electric vehicle market in Russia is zero customs duties.
The zero rate will be valid until the end of 2014, the possibility of its extension and the extension of the preferential list is being worked out.
The replacement of the transport tax for environmental (the idea is discussed and applies to all cars) will also support the market, but not as tangible as customs preferences, Pankov believes.
The transport tax in Russia is small, says Pankov, unlike, for example, Norway, where the reduction of the tax has led to a sharp increase in sales of electric vehicles - now they account for 12% of the market.
In Russia, stimulating measures are also needed for car owners, such as free parking in the city center (as already done in Moscow), Pankov is convinced, or the possibility of moving electric vehicles along dedicated lanes, which in Russia is not yet.
Private plane crashes in Colorado
The Piper PA-46 crashed in the US state of Colorado.
Three of the five people on board were killed, ITAR-TASS reports.
Survivors were taken to hospital.
The accident occurred a few kilometers from the runway of Denver airport.
The causes of the tragedy are now being established.
In the Donetsk region are dealing with captive militants of the Donbass battalion.
The criminals were surrounded by Ilovaisk.
They were betrayed by their own commanders, and dozens of security personnel were killed under the shelling.
Those who survived say that if they knew what the situation in the southeast of Ukraine is, they would not go to war.
108 prisoners can be called lucky.
The combatants of the Donbass battalion remained alive after the “meat smashing” in which they were caught near Ilovaisk.
In the surrounding of the army of the Donetsk People’s Republic, the militants spent several days, actually abandoned by their commanders and the authorities of Ukraine.
When the headquarters informed that it was possible to get out of the "ring" through the allegedly provided corridor, the column moved.
But literally a few minutes later, shells and bullets were heard from all sides.
"Judging by the information I was given, we had a corridor, we were allowed to exit," said the deputy commander of the battalion, who has a call for "Lermontov".
And when we descended into the lowlands between Multipol and Crvenoselsky, a crossfire began with anti-tank guided missiles, with "zushks", 30-millimeter grenades, BMD automatic guns, firearms.
There were four cars in front of me and three in the back, and there were only two cars left.
The officer with the call "Lermontov" says: almost immediately killed at least 60 people, dozens were wounded, many died later.
The survivors are now given medical care by those they came to kill.
Now the prisoners are surprised that the so-called “terrorists” treat them well, give them food and medicines.
In the meantime, their own commanders actually deceived them and sentenced them to death.
We were betrayed, they say.
A column, the whole battalion, to destroy it.
As many of his comrades, Alexei joined the Donbass battalion as a volunteer, because the Ukrainian news the atrocities allegedly committed by the “separatists” in the southeast.
Here, Alexey saw a completely different picture.
His mother was killed in Luhansk – and not anyone, but Ukrainian military.
A friend called me, told me that there was a mortar shelling, that it was most likely the Ukrainian armed forces, - says one of the soldiers, Alexei.
I wanted to leave the battalion.
We were not released from Ilovaisk, they said we were in the ring.
I have already agreed with the commander, the report has already written about leaving.
We were immediately taken from Zurakhovo to Ilovaisk.
According to the prisoners, 300-350 people were stuck in the "cottage" near Ilovaisk.
Now some survivors admit that if time could be turned back, they would not have joined the punitive battalion for anything.
All prisoners were handed over to the forces of the DPR.
Everyone will be checked for involvement in war crimes.
In the region established the headquarters for limiting the prices of products
In the Krasnoyarsk region, a headquarters has been established, which, if necessary, will limit the growth of product prices in the region's market.
The decree on the establishment of this structure has already been signed.
The staff consisted of members of the regional government, representatives of the executive power and supervisory agencies.
Together, they will monitor the prices of agricultural products in the country.
Will Kiev compensate Rosneft for $140 million in losses?
The head of Rosneft Igor Sechin said that the company estimates the damage from the shelling of Lisychansk NPP in Ukraine at $140 million.
He said this in an interview with Spiegel.
“We are estimating the damage at $140 million and will be negotiating with the Ukrainian government on the payment of compensation,” Sechin said.
According to him, the commissioning of the modernized Lisichansk NPZ was planned in 2014.
However, part of the factory was destroyed by Ukrainian artillery.
“There were no battles there, there were no ‘buried rebels’, but Ukrainian artillery destroyed part of the industrial facility.
In addition, the technological oil pumped into the pipes has disappeared," he said.
On July 18, a reservoir for oil storage was burned and the buildings of two warehouses were destroyed.
Lisychansk NPP - the main oil refinery in Ukraine, the first line of the enterprise was put into operation in October 1976.
The total capacity of the Lisichan NPP is about 7 million tons of oil raw materials per year.
The plant is capable of producing fuel of the Euro-4 standard, as well as a batch of diesel fuel of the Euro-5 standard.
In March 2012, oil supplies to Lisichansk NPP were suspended due to its losses.
The company decided to start repairs.
A year later, Rosneft received the Lisichan NPP along with other Ukrainian assets of TNK-BR.
North Korea has launched a short-range missile in the direction of the Sea of Japan.
According to South Korean media reports, the incident occurred around 10:30 a.m. local time from the province of Chagando, which is on the border between North Korea and China.
According to Interfax in the Joint Committee of Chiefs of Staff of South Korea, it is believed that the missile fell into the Sea of Japan after flying about 220 kilometers.
Ruble falls against geopolitical pressure
At the Moscow Stock Exchange, the dollar rose at the opening of 3 cop. to 37.15 rubles, the ruble dropped to the bivalve basket against the backdrop of geopolitical tensions.
Trade on the ETS on the dollar started with transactions in the boundaries of 37.11-37.2 rubles / $ 1, on average for two minutes, the rate was fixed at the level of 37.16 rubles / $ 1, which is 4 cop. above the level of the previous closure.
The euro exchange rate was 48.79 rubles for 1 euro, which is 3 copies higher than the previous closing level.
The price of the binary currency basket added 3.5 kop. and amounted to 42,395 rubles.
The US dollar is traded 23 cop. above the official exchange rate, the euro - 16 cop. above the official exchange rate.
The Russian market continued to decline on Friday, August 29, but there was no panic this time.
It continued to lower the ruble and even updated its historic high to the dollar.
Now investors are already anticipating the deterioration of the geopolitical situation and possible new sanctions against Russia.
For now, however, this is more like an artificial hysteria inflated through the media, especially the Western.
The possibilities of imposing new sanctions on Russia are not so many.
At the opening of the Moscow Stock Exchange, the ruble continues to weaken sharply against the binary currency basket.
The geopolitical background remains a determining factor.
However, if we do not see a new negative in the near future, both the Russian indices and the position of the national currency may be adjusted.
"Orenburg Airlines" will be tried with "Ideal-Tour"
Orenburg airlines have filed lawsuits against Ideal-Turu for a total of 4.7 billion rubles.
There are two issues that will be discussed in October.
The cases will be handled by different judges.
According to Interfax, the first complaint was filed on August 14.
It is worth just over 425 million rubles.
The meeting is scheduled for October 7.
The second application was filed on 18 August.
Its value is 4.24 billion rubles.
The meeting is scheduled for October 2.
As told journalists in the Russian Union of tourism industry, judges in cases are appointed different.
In July in the media appeared information about the debts of "Ideal-tur" to "Orenburg airlines" in the amount of 1.5 billion rubles.
Airline CEO Viktor Zyukin says the sum is 1.6 billion rubles.
General Director of Aeroflot Vitaly Savelyev calls an even greater amount - two billion rubles.
Twitter is trying to be more interesting for new users
The microblogging service Twitter has changed the user registration process to engage new participants in active interaction with the platform faster.
This measure should reduce the number of people who abandon their microblogs.
Now, new Twitter users will be able to view a large number of recommended accounts during registration to make their reading circle right away.
Recommendations are made on the basis of the interests stated at the time of registration.
At the same time, Twitter automatically sets the subscription box for all automatically selected accounts.
Because of this, the user will have to manually remove the boxes, so as not to read those that are not of interest to him.
If previously users of the microblogging service saw only the avatars of recommended users, then now Twitter takes the sample of one of the popular tweets of the blogger to help make an impression of the person.
This is the biggest change to Twitter’s registration page in the last three years.
Recently, Twitter has been actively working on the modernization of the service.
This activity is primarily associated with the service’s ongoing attempts to impenetrability.
In 2014, the microblogging service faced a slowing growth in the user base and a decline in reader activity.
The company is now desperately in need of a greater number of loyal consumers, which, once entered, would remain for a long time.
This is the only way to ensure a stable flow of advertising funds.
The day of knowledge in Moscow will be dull and rainy.
The first of September in the Moscow region throughout the day will be cool and rainy, meteorologists report.
The air temperature in Moscow will be from 16 to 18 degrees, in the Moscow suburb - 13-18 degrees.
When cloudy with clarified weather places will rain, the wind of the eastern quarter at the same time will be quite weak - only 3-8 meters per second.
Vehicle recycling program resumed from September 1
In Russia, the car recycling program has been resumed since September 1.
Until December 31, 2014, 10 billion rubles will be allocated for these purposes.
As explained by the head of the Ministry of Trade of the Russian Federation Denis Manturov, the money is allocated from the limits, which have already been brought to the Ministry of Industry and Trade of the Russian Federation by redistribution from other areas of support.
The program will affect all vehicles older than six years.
The amount of compensation will range from 40 thousand for a passenger car to 350 thousand rubles for a cargo.
In Russia, a similar car recycling program has already been implemented.
The main difference of the current project, the minister explained, is that now it is not only supposed to dispose of the cars to obtain a subsequent discount, but also the possibility in case the car has reached the age of more than six years, to purchase a new one with a discount when handing over the old in the "trade-in" from the dealer.
More than 16 billion rubles were spent on the previous federal recycling program, which was in effect from January 1, 2010 to December 31, 2011.
Thanks to it, the level of production of passenger cars in 2010 amounted to about 1.2 million units (this is plus 101.4% compared to 2009).
Creator of Coming Out Simulator to release game about modern journalism
Game designer Nikki Case, known for the game Coming Out Simulator decided to release a game about modern journalism.
He spoke about his project in an interview with Kill Screen.
Case started working on the game a few weeks ago, but this fact became widely known only now.
The inspiration for the game came from the events in Ferguson, where the protests started after a police officer killed an unarmed black teenager.
The focus of the project, which has no name yet, will be on how the information exposure of stories affects their consequences.
The hero of the game, a civilian journalist, will have to photograph what is happening in areas where clashes between the police and the population.
The hero can take different photographs of what is happening, which will affect the course of events.
If he shoots a scene in which the policemen look like heroes and the protesters are bandits, the police will start to treat him better and let him go where ordinary people can’t go.
If he sheds light on events differently, his photographs could turn peaceful protests into a massive uprising.
Points in the game will need to be raised with the help of the hero's tweet, in which new subscribers will appear, if the photos posted there will be popular.
The game has no name yet.
The release date and platforms on which it will appear are unknown.
Case, however, published an image showing how an event can change depending on how a photograph of him is taken and processed.
In an interview with Kill Screen, Case explained that he had been thinking about the concept of such a game for a long time, but initially wanted to dedicate it not to protests in the United States, but to events in the Gaza Strip.
After he began collecting material for the game, the game designer realized he lacked the knowledge and skills to cover the history of the region.
However, when he saw how the media covered the events in Ferguson, he decided to make a game based on what happened.
Nikki Case is an independent developer who releases browser games.
His most famous project was Coming Out Simulator, released in 2014.
This game, which tells the events from the biography of Case himself, is devoted to how a bisexual teenager tries to tell about his relationship to homophobic parents.
Heletey pulls Ukraine into the continuation of bloodshed
With the call to prepare for the next "tens of thousands" of victims, the Minister of Defense of Ukraine Valery Heletey is drawing the people into the continuation of the bloody confrontation, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation said.
“Moscow, of course, paid attention to the statements of the head of the Ukrainian military department Valery Heletey, who stated that the “operation to liberate the East of Ukraine from terrorists” and the beginning of the “Great Patriotic War”, the losses in which will be counted “tens of thousands”.
The degree of adequacy of the head of the military department of Ukraine, who published on his page in Facebook the aforementioned post, is a subject for research of specialists not in the military field," the Russian diplomats said in a statement.
They hardly believe that such statements may belong to the Minister of Defense of a civilized state.
On his Facebook page, the Minister of Defense of Ukraine wrote on Monday: "On unofficial channels, the Russian side has threatened several times that in case of continued resistance they are ready to use tactical nuclear weapons against us."
At the same time, he stated that the “operation to liberate the east of Ukraine” has been completed.

Tony Stewart suffered an accident while returning to the track
Tony Stewart's return to the track ended a little more than in the middle of the race on the Atlanta Motor Speedway.
Stuart crashed into a wall for the second time after his right front tire broke out on 172 rounds, ending his performance.
Stuart brought his crushed car to the garage and then went out without talking to reporters.

We’ll go to Richmond and hopefully we’ll get better there.
Stewart first crashed into a wall earlier in the race on Sunday evening after a collision with Kyle Bush, requiring repairs on the right side of his car.
“I started today with a pretty big hope of successfully reaching the finish,” Johnston said, adding, “It just didn’t work.”
Shortly after the second accident, Stuart’s car was sinked into the evacuator, and the team gathered and was ready to leave.
Stewart missed three NASCAR Sprint Cup races after his car crashed and killed another driver during a race on the ground track in the northern state of New York.

Sobchak and Vitorgan eat cigarettes with Zhvanetsky in Odessa
Ksenia Sobchak and Maxim Vitorgan are now in Odessa, which the TV host did not forget to report in her Instagram.
True, one photo very surprised and very confused the fans of the couple.

Bulgarian prison officials hold national protest
Hundreds of prison officials from all over Bulgaria held a national protest in front of the Ministry of Justice in the capital of the country, Sofia.
During a peaceful demonstration, they reiterated their demands to return to previous working conditions, which have recently been changed.
The increase in salaries is also included in the list of requirements that will be discussed with the temporary minister of justice Hristo Ivanov.
Over the course of a month, officers have expressed a symbolic protest against the new work schedule, demanding the return of the previous 24-hour shifts.
Despite the fact that the union of prison workers has repeatedly met with representatives of the Ministry of Justice, an agreement was not reached, reports the Bulgarian National Radio (BPR).

Members of the Federation of Trade Unions of the Ministry of Internal Affairs are expected to join the protest.
Army controls new government in Thailand
General Prayat (right) appointed Minister of Defence Regev Wangsuwan (left)
The military ruler and prime minister of Thailand, General Praut Chan-ocha, has announced the composition of the new cabinet of ministers of the country, in which more than a third of positions are held by generals or generals in retirement.
Representatives of the army received key positions: ministers of defense, finance, foreign affairs and trade.
Prate Chang-ocha was officially approved as prime minister on Monday after the king of Thailand officially approved the appointment of the head of the interim military government for the post.
The 60-year-old military, who seized power in the country as a result of the bloodless coup on May 22, was the only candidate for the prime minister post.
He was elected Prime Minister in Parliament.
Earlier, the army appointed members of parliament.
According to Prayat Chang-ocha, the coup was the only way to maintain stability.
It was preceded by six months of demonstrations, during which protesters demanded the resignation of the government of Prime Minister Yinglak Chinavat.
Officially, Prate Chang-ocha will be the interim prime minister as the military plans to hold general elections at the end of 2015.
However, there are fears that the military is trying to strengthen its power in the country.
The military came to power on May 22.
The total paralyzing of civil power.
Leaders of major political parties were detained.
Immediately after the military came to power, they temporarily arrested the country’s leading politicians, including Prime Minister Yinglik Chinavat.
Several journalists and public figures were also detained.
The current political crisis dates back to 2006, when the army removed his brother, Yinglik Chinavat Taksin, from the post of prime minister.
Both are popular with the rural population, especially in the northern regions of the country, which has secured them success in the elections.
However, many representatives of the middle class and capital elite have entered the anti-government movement, which since November 2013 has virtually paralyzed the country.
No one has said that the salad will be better, I didn’t promise you that, the waitress from the new Palm bracelet jokes.
You have to formally admit that this is true, but the mind and stomach remain unwavering.
After all, everyone has long known: we say “Belgium” – we mean Midi, we say “Midi” – we mean “Belgium”.
Restaurants like to say deeply that the success of an establishment depends on three factors: location, location and again location.
There are such places that are located not so well, and even great, but some nonsense.
In short, sitting at the Palm table, I remembered that once there was a cafe "Gorodok" here (in honor of the same TV show), then "Odessa-mama", and also a restaurant "Bozole" and a beer "Friendship".
Now here again beer, but no longer nostalgic-Soviet, but Belgian.
Only the tip of the iceberg was placed above the ground: a bar stand and a pair of tables, the rest of the space is deprived of even a hint of sunlight.
But here it is fun, like in the children's room: red, yellow and green walls, multi-colored chairs, instead of windows - TVs, where the girls swim.
Belgian institutions in St. Petersburg have long been not new, so there is something to compare with.
There are eight types of breweries (260-300 rubles for 0.5 liters) and countless bottling (170-1550 rubles).
A company-positive waitress cheerfully presents the menu, telling that "midi is satiate large seeds", and it should be noted: it is the service, despite the individual shortcomings, is the most positive side of Palm.
The menu is expected in content, but often very unexpected in execution.
Well, who, for example, is given to predict that the meat roulette with valley slime (280 rubles) is actually a carpaccio, also cut so thin that pergament paper compared to it will appear to be a matter ugly thick.
You can feel at least some taste only if you swallow the potatoes together.
The salad is even worse.
The classic Leigh (260) would most correctly be recognized as a crime against the Belgian people: some swollen iceberg, once cooked potatoes, cracked Kenyan beans, roasted bacon chips, plus somewhat marinated onions.
With such a salad you will not wish to meet anyone!
The composition of the ingredients of the Belgian salad was partially different, but the impression was also not positive.
If you could still close your eyes on the immature quarters of cherry tomatoes or fried champignons, then why the midias look as if they had time to freeze and boil several times during their lives!
After all, I already know: there are quite normal white sea midi!
They are served in pots "in sauce of your choice" (490-560 rubles for 0.5 kg).
Half a dozen sauces, one that is made of white wine, celery and carrots, frankly did not guess.
Vegetables are there, and the smell is absent, and whether there was wine there, it remains a mystery.
But good relying on midias frites with home mayonnaise.
Chicken waterzoom here is not a snack, thick to the extent that depending on the mood you can decide, the first or second dish in front of you, but just a pleasant butter soup.
It was stated that the rabbit was cooked in beer sauce by a local chef, and nothing was said about rosemary.
By the way, the situation turned out to be diametrically opposite: the rosemary stifled everything.
It seemed that this rabbit during his lifetime was fed exclusively with rosemary bushes, which is why the meat acquired such an unusual aroma.
But at the same time, the rabbit's foot was attached to a wonderful - no, just a great pear in a caramelized crust.
Waffles in Palm are offered not only sweet, but also satiated - with beef, chicken or bacon and cheese (220-280).
Clown sauce turned out to be excessively watery, and the waffles were dried.
But the manager who approached the table asked very informally about the lunch impressions.
So it is worth coming again.
The dollar rose above 37 rubles on the news of new sanctions prepared by the West against Russia.
This is a new historical record.
The dollar calculations "tomorrow" to 10:29 Moscow rose by 26.9 kopecks and amounted to 37.02 rubles, the exchange rate of the euro rose by 30 kopecks - to 48.73 rubles, according to the data of the Moscow Stock Exchange.
The binary currency basket rose by 28 kopecks to the level of the previous closure and cost 42.28 rubles.
Before the Crimean events, the dollar reached a peak on February 19, 2009 - then it was worth 36.43 rubles, and on March 3, 2014 it was already 37,005 rubles.
On the night of August 29, the White House that U.S. President Barack Obama and German Chancellor Angela Merkel were discussing the possibility of introducing additional sanctions against Russia.
The weakening of the ruble is long-term, both in pair with the euro and in pair with the dollar.
The long-term forecast suggested this mark, says Alpary senior analyst Anna Bodrova.
Everything related to Ukraine will one way or another be reflected in the courses.
As long as this continues, investors will react.
Today, rumors about the invasion of troops have not been confirmed on either side, but the market has proved to be very emotional.
All the talk that he was resistant to such news was overturned yesterday.
The week, according to the forecast of the specialist, will close around these levels - 36,90 and 37,05 rubles per dollar.
The tax period has ended, oil prices are weak, policy, sanctions, the problem of gas transit through Ukraine – all these are links in one chain.
Inflation is also predicted to rise: the current prices for autumn will increase from 5 to 10%.
In addition, seasonal fruits and vegetables will soon end, and there will be a vacuum as the networks reorient to other suppliers.
"The dollar approached the mark of 37 rubles, passed it and returned, there is no powerful hysteria," commented the head of the market analysis department "Opening Broker" Konstantin Bushuev.
They will still see if they will introduce the sanctions promised on Saturday, as NATO will meet.
The ruble, according to him, sharply weakened after the end of the tax season, then followed news on Ukraine, in addition, the central bank last week said that by the end of the year completely moves to a floating rate and refuses any currency interventions.
If you look at the daily fluctuation, it was no different from the previous ones during this month, everyone was frightened by the mark of 37 rubles, the analyst continues.
So, in terms of turnaround, nothing powerful happened.
The worrisome times for the foreign exchange market were, I recall, when there was an increased demand for currency at the end of January, as well as the third of March, when the central bank shipped a record amount of currency.
The UFS IC also sees the positive side of the weakening of the ruble.
First of all, this is an increase in the revenue part of the budget from export operations, as well as an increase in the competitiveness of domestic producers due to higher imports, says UFS IC chief analyst Alexei Kozlov.
Negative points can be attributed to the price increases of imported goods and services.
The sharp fluctuations of the Russian currency significantly reduce the attractiveness of investing in the Russian economy, provoke an increase in inflationary pressure and, as a consequence, become the cause of increasing the cost of borrowing money, which in turn inhibits the development of the country’s economy.
If we talk about the stock market, the depreciation of the ruble somewhat smoothed the decline in the prices of stocks, expressed in rubles.
For example, the MMVB Index in the course of trading on Thursday decreased by 1.67%, and the RTS Index lost 3.27%.
Such a significant difference in the relative value of the decline of indices is explained by the weakening of the ruble over the course of the day by more than 1.5%.
The weakening of the ruble is emotional in nature and is explained by the massive desire to buy currency.
As practice shows, gradually emotions go away, and ruble quotes partially or completely restore lost positions.
"We believe that soon we will be able to see the ratio of the dollar and the Russian currency close to the level of 36 rubles per dollar", - notes Alexei Kozlov.
Genetic disorders are often misdiagnosed
She said she spent many years thinking she would die after being misdiagnosed.
Carrie Rogers spent most of her teenage years thinking that she had only a few years to live after she was diagnosed with another disease.
In fact, she had Charcot-Marie-Touty’s disease (CMD) – a group of hereditary disorders that lead to nerve damage outside the brain and spine.
The charity CMT UK that misdiagnosis is a common problem among people with STD because so little is known about the condition.
Approximately 23,000 people in the UK are believed to have CT, which can cause motor symptoms such as muscle weakness, uncertain walking, and compressed toes.
Patients may feel numbness or pain, and the condition is not healed and progresses, meaning the symptoms worsen over time.
When Rogers was 13, she thought she was suffering from Friedrich ataxia (AF), a condition for which the prognosis was very poor.
Rogers thought she would be tied to a wheelchair by the time she was 18, and would die before she was 30.
The mother of two children, who is now 51, said: “As a child, I knew I couldn’t do what others did.
I fell every day, and I had more time for everything.
I was never able to ride rollercoat or skateboard with other children, and I was harassed a lot in school because of the way I walked and ran.
Rogers said that when she was 13, after several operations to release the Achilles tendon and straighten her feet, she looked into the medical card when her doctor left the room and it was written that she had AF.
“I felt guilty because I nodded my nose where I shouldn’t go and so I didn’t tell anyone, but I went home, found information about this state in the library and wrote to the AF Association,” she said.
When I received the information in response, I was shocked and experienced the most terrible panic possible.
I thought I would be in the wheelchair at 18 and die before I was 25, and that I would gradually lose all my abilities in the meantime.
I went through it alone and planned my own funeral.
She said that by the time she was 17, she realized that her ability to walk had not deteriorated as much as she thought, and asked her doctor about it.
He just stood up, hugged me and said, “My dear, I don’t think you have this disease because you’d already be in the wheelchair.”
I think you have something that poses a much less threat to life.
After several genetic examinations, she was found with STD.
“When he explained what STM was, I thought I pulled out a happy ticket,” she said.
The UK SMT charity has announced a month of information on SMT to try to draw attention to the disease.
Tax burden on entrepreneurs in Washington Zone increases as the economy recovers
A recovering economy means more customers, more sales and new jobs.
It also means higher taxes.
State and local tax bills for companies across the country increased moderately last year as the economic recovery accelerated, according to a new study published last week, and companies in the Washington Zone are no exception.
Companies in the county, Maryland and Virginia combined paid $27.6 billion to the state and local treasury in fiscal 2013, 3.8 percent more than $26.6 billion raised in 2012.
The tax burden on by state and local level increased by 4.3 percent last year, to $671 billion, compared to 3.9 percent a year earlier, and this was the third consecutive year of growth after consecutive years when bills declined, in 2009 and 2010.
State taxes grew faster, 4.3 percent than local taxes, 3.9 percent, according to a study conducted by a professional service firm, Ernst & Young and the State Taxation Center, a tax policy group.
More than half of the county’s tax revenue, 56 percent, comes from entrepreneurial taxes, while 36 percent of Maryland’s tax revenue comes from firms.
Virginia, with 28 percent, brings the lowest amount of tax revenue, proportionally, from entrepreneurs.
The growth in tax revenues is largely driven by a return to the company’s previous level of real estate value, the researchers say, which raised real estate taxes by 3.7 percent this year after three consecutive years of growth of less than 1 percent.
While a large proportion of these revenue comes from large states such as California, New York and Texas, it seems that the same is happening in the Washington Zone.
Companies in the county, Maryland and Virginia combined paid $10 billion in state and local real estate taxes last year, $9.6 billion more than in 2012, an increase of 4.2 percent from the previous year.
However, the observed return on real estate value has no similar effect on state and local tax revenue growth in Maryland, where real estate taxes barely exceed one-fifth of corporate tax accounts.
Companies in Virginia and District of Columbia pay about half of their state and local tax bills in the form of real estate taxes.
“What’s happening in Maryland is that so much of their real estate, especially the tax base around the District of Columbia, belongs either to the government or to a non-profit organization that doesn’t pay real estate taxes,” said Douglas Lindholm, executive director of the State Taxation Center.
Thus, Maryland is forced to rely much more on, for example, income taxes to pay for the same services that are available in other states.
The recent increase in tax revenues from entrepreneurs cannot be fully explained by the recovery of the real estate market.
Entrepreneurs' incomes also appear to be going to the correction, according to these data.
Companies in the region declared corporate income tax at the state level of $2.3 billion, $2.1 billion more than in 2012.
Maryland has raised $1 billion in corporate income tax revenues, the largest in the region.
Although trends are directed in the same direction, the tax burden of entrepreneurs at the local level is not increasing at the same rate in all three locations.
Growth in the District of Columbia was at the same level as the national average, 4.3 percent, while growth in Maryland was significantly faster, 4.9 percent.
In Virginia alone, tax revenues rose below average of 4.1 percent.
Virginia had the lowest corporate income tax of three jurisdictions (each of which has the same corporate rate) of 6 percent.
In Maryland, the corporate rate is 8.25 percent, while in the county it is relatively high – 9.975 percent.
A similar study by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce earlier this year found that Virginia has lower taxes for entrepreneurs by state and locally and, overall, a more favorable tax climate for entrepreneurs than Maryland.
The district was not evaluated in this study.
Despite its advantage, Virginia is experiencing competitive pressure from its southern neighbor.
North Carolina recently signed a legislation lowering corporate interest rate this year from 6.9 percent to 6 percent, just like in Virginia, and the rate will fall to 5 percent next year.
If the state continues to tax revenue targets next year, this law could bring the income tax rate for entrepreneurs to even 3 percent by 2017.
Meanwhile, small in the Washington Area seem to feel better and thus pay more taxes across the state and locally, according to a recent study.
Entrepreneurial taxes paid in the form of individual income tax by small business owners – the transitional structure under which most small firms are organized – in the District of Columbia, Maryland and Virginia increased by 20 percent last year to $2.4 billion, at a much faster growth rate than entrepreneurial taxes overall.
Researchers say the trend and increase in business tax revenue across the country is likely to persist this year, with state and local government turnover tax revenue rising by 6.2 percent over the first three quarters of 2014 compared to the same period last year.
However, the Washington Zone may be lagging behind as the decline in federal spending affects the region’s labor market.
The Bronze Age of Russian Judo
The home world championship in judo brought the Russian national team two silver and seven bronze awards.
According to this indicator, the Russians ceded only to the main favourite of the competition - the national team of Japan.
The tournament in Chelyabinsk started on Monday, and the first day brought the Russian team a silver medal.
Its owner was Beslan Mudranov, who played in the category up to 60 kg.
At the same time, in the equal final struggle with Baldbaatar Ganbat from Mongolia, the outcome of the confrontation was decided by only one note received by the Russians.
But the second day of the tournament was the most successful for the Russian national team - on Tuesday, three medals were won at once.
In the men's competitions in the category up to 66 kg silver came to Mikhail Puleyev, and bronze - Kamala Han-Magomedov.
In the final match, the Russians succumbed to the world champion of 2011 and 2013 Japanese Masashi Abinume.
Khan-Magomedov, who lost to his compatriot in the quarter-final stage, went victoriously through the comforting tournament and became the winner of the bronze award.
In the women's tournament of the category up to 52 kg also to the third stage of the piedestal of honor got Natalia Kuzyutina.
In the semi-final she lost to the current world champion Milinda Kelmendi from Kosovo, who at this championship played under the flag of the International Judo Federation and successfully defended the title.
In the dispute for the bronze Kuzyutina won from Ma Inan from China, but after the end of the tournament still admitted that the third place is not what she expected.
And again the obstacle on the way of the Russian to gold was Kelmendi, who defeated Kuzyutina earlier in the final of the European Championship.
On the third day of the tournament in Chelyabinsk the bronze in the treasury of the national team of Russia placed Musa Mogushkov, who fought in the category up to 73 kg.
In the quarter-finals, his offender was former representative of Moldova Viktor Сковорцов, now acting for the team of the UAE.
However, then the Russian won two battles and became the winner of the award.
Mogushkov played at the home championship with an ankle injury, which he plans to heal soon, so he will take a break in the competitions.
As for the former Moldovan Skvortsov, he and he at this tournament reached the bronze medal.
Interestingly, another of his compatriots, who took the sports citizenship of the UAE, Ivan Remarenko with bronze completed the performance in the category up to 100 kg.
The fourth day of the 2014 World Cup also brought the Russians one bronze, which in the category up to 81 kg won Ivan Nifontov.
In the difficult battle of the small final, he defeated the Frenchman Alan Schmitt at the expense of the opponent's remarks.
On Friday, the tournament played three sets of awards at once, but the Russians traditionally limited to one bronze in the men's tournament up to 90 kg.
Its owner became Kirill Vaprosov, and the Russian national team this medal was guaranteed: his rival in the consoling final was compatriot Kirill Denisov.
However, the struggle itself did not take place: the opponent was unable to go out on the tatami due to injury.
The men's bronze was won by the hosts and on the sixth day of the competition - it was placed in the stock of the national team by Renat Saidov, who played in the category of over 100 kg.
In the consoling final he won a pure victory over the Brazilian David Moura.
Thus ended the individual part of the world championship.
On the last day of the tournament in Chelyabinsk, on Sunday, the titles of world champions in team competitions were played.
Both Russian national teams - both male and female - were among the main contenders for the awards, but, like in individual competitions, the representatives of the fair sex were not lucky - they did not get to the medal.
But the Russian judoists won the command silver.
In the decisive confrontation they in a stubborn struggle with the account of 2-3 ceded to the main favourite of the competition - the team of Japan.
At the same time, the national team of Russia led 2-0 after a net victory of Han-Magomedov and volley - Denis Yartsov (weight up to 73 kg).
However, in heavier weight categories with their Japanese rivals were unable to cope with Murat Khabachirov (81), Mohammad Magomedov (90) and Aslan Kambiyev (100).
According to the same scenario developed and bronze match in the women's tournament, where the Russian national team, leading 2-0, ceded to the Japanese - 2-3.
At the team competitions in Chelyabinsk was present Russian President Vladimir Putin, who after the end of the tournament congratulated the men's national team with silver.
"The second place is very honorable, but I want to say that it was visible that you could become champions," Putin said.
To lose the Japanese, the ancestors of judo - there is nothing shameful here.
But I am sure you can win them.
The Russian team at the home world championship performed much better than a year ago at competitions of similar level, which took place in Rio de Janeiro.
At that time, the Russian team had only three medals – one silver and two bronze.
At the same time, the current tournament was missed by the Olympic champions Arsen Halstyan and Mansour Isayev.
We are all great maximists.
I want gold medals.
But let us remember that if a person in the Olympic cycle is among the eight strongest, then he is a potential winner of the Olympics.
Especially in such a sport as judo", - summed up the results of the tournament Minister of Sports of the Russian Federation Vitaly Mutko, whose words is quoted by the press service of the championship.
Japan's national team is expected to become the best in Chelyabinsk, having won 11 medals of various dignity, five of which turned out to be gold.
The next World Championship will take place next summer in Astana.

The Joan Rivers family hopes for the best.
Joan Rivers has been unconscious since she arrived in a New York hospital three days ago, but her daughter expressed hope today that the 81-year-old comedy actress will recover from the illness.
“Thank you for your constant love and support,” Melissa Rivers said in a statement today.
We hope for the best.
Her mother arrived at Mount Sinai Hospital on Thursday after an emergency call about her having a cardiac arrest at the Yorkville Endoscope Clinic in Upper East Side, sources say.
Doctors deliberately keep her under narcissism and strict surveillance until they are satisfied with her condition, which remains "heavy".
The response was widespread, including numerous online support from such as Donald Trump, Montel Williams and Kelly Rippa.
Everyone can be king.
On sale is the debut album of the group Royal Blood - a new hope of British rock, which brought rock duets from clubs straight to the stadiums.
The duo Royal Blood has only been on stage for a year, but already has a nomination for the BBC Music Award, a tour at the Arctic Monkeys and a visit to the New York concert by Jimmy Page himself.
Their debut album of the same name a few months before the release received 100 thousand pre-orders, and the contract for its release lies in the portfolio of the major label Warner Music.
Given the current deplorable situation in the music market, the situation is out of the line, because we are not talking about the new Lana Del Rey or the next sweet-haired representative of the "new R'n'B", but about a duo of bullshit in the appearance of the British, playing with the level of volume and intensity that was last in fashion a couple of decades ago.
In general, the stakes on the first album in connection with all the above circumstances were especially high and already quite justified.
The duo did not in vain take a name, which previously could be attacked unless quite desperate hairy metalists, and the blood of which kings flow, as they think, in their veins, is also understandable.
It is, of course, first of all about the heroes of the past level Led Zeppelin: like the great quartet, Royal Blood aim to shake the stagnant blood of British rock, bringing it to a new height.
It is early to make predictions about the success of this enterprise,, but something can already be stated.
A dozen songs set in thirty minutes is not so much a demonstration of phenomenal composer talent, but a confident and powerful declaration of intentions.
Some advantages of individual numbers, of course, cannot be denied: say, the pilot single "Out Of The Black" is characterized by the fact that it is remembered not by a melodic line, but by a drum batch.
The musicians jokingly say that this song is generally easier to hit than to sing.
It is also worth highlighting the powerful "Little Monster" and the closing record song "Better Strangers" with a Shakespeare quote in the title.
However, the truth is that each of these songs will sound great at a heavy rock party, but when played in a row they merge into a more or less homogeneous canvas.
And it is not necessarily bad, even the opposite.
The strength of Royal Blood is that they do not claim the laurels of the new Lennon and McCartney (rather they are thrown into the successors of Motörhead), but have taken numerous rock duets from ghetto indie clubs.
Their music, despite some diversity, is created for the stadiums, in a room designed for less than a couple of thousands of people, it is obviously tight.
The secret is partly in the clever use of the bass, which replaced the guitar in the usual format, invented at the beginning of the zero The White Stripes.
However, it’s not just about the instruments, but also about the approach to composing songs.
Heroes of the retro zero with great difficulty were chosen beyond the postmodernist paradigm, with great reluctance went to recognize themselves not just epigones, but independent creative units.
Royal Blood already sounds so powerful and sharp that this pressure successfully draps some secondarity and hardness of the musical material.
Who said rock must be smart?
Amazon to buy Twitch for $1.04 billion
AMAZON just confirmed what Information on Friday morning: The online store — and video producer, and a hundred other things — is buying the streaming video streaming service Twitch for $1.04 billion ($970 million).
This news was a surprise not because nobody expected Twitch to be sold, but because many expected YouTube to be a buyer.
Three months ago, the sale of Twitch to Google video service for a good billion seemed completely finished, and this combination looked natural.
Twitch, founded just three years ago as Justin.tv, set the goal of being a broadcasting service of a general nature – a version of YouTube in real time.
Instead, it quickly turned into a platform where gamers broadcast their in-game moments; “YouTube for real-time gaming,” according to Business Insider.
The Twitch interface.
And "let's play", a genre of videos in which all-knowers give (mostly old) games processing, like in the "Mysterious Theatre", are already popular on YouTube.
The fact is that YouTube is often mentioned when describing Twitch, so the news that YouTube is acquiring Twitch was met with little interest, a classic example of a rooted technology company buying out a potential competitor.
It’s a secret why the deal with YouTube failed, given that it was allegedly willing to pay no less than Amazon.
Twitch CEO Emmet Shir said: “We chose Amazon because they believe in our community, they share our values and long-term goals, and they want to help us them faster.”
Another secret, frankly, is the incredible success of Twitch.
For snobs like me, who say they’re better off playing sports than watching them, it’s hard to understand the attractiveness of watching games instead of taking a joystick.
One thing is to look through a friend’s shoulder at 3 a.m. as she rolls through Resident Evil, and quite another is to watch a stranger get 20 shots in the head in a row in Call of Duty.
All the games you can watch right now.
Another problem is that many of the most popular games today are designed for one person, so watching them shoot without controlling the angle of sight on their own can be a headache recipe worthy of Do It Right.
I agree that the high-speed passes in which the Roger Bannister of our electronic age finishes entire games in record time are entertaining.
But unless it’s about the virtuosity of the game or the humor, it’s unlikely that his Twitch channel will be interesting at all.
But what do skeptics like me know?
Twitch has 55 million unique visitors a month, making it the fourth largest source of peak internet traffic.
How will Amazon profit from this?
It’s hard to imagine that Twitch will fold into Amazon Instant Video as elegantly as YouTube could just absorb Twitch.
However, Twitch has something any company would love to get: the crowds of young men advertisers dream of.
As the head of Twitch Shire said, Amazon and Twitch "both believe in the future of games," and this channel does not show signs of fading, even - oh - as a spectacular sport.
In 2004, more than 330 people were killed in terrorist attacks, including 186 children.
More than 800 people were wounded.
We spent a few days in Beslan.
We spoke with the surviving hostages - almost all now students, with the parents of the dead, with the caregiver of the cemetery - the City of Angels - Ramon Kaspolatov, the head of the committee "Mother Beslan" Susanna Dudieva, who took part in the special operation as an employee of the Ministry of Emergencies, - tells the correspondent of the department "Company" Elizabeth Antonova, who worked on the special project.
Already returning to Moscow, we met with Aslambek Aslahanov, who 10 years ago was the president’s adviser on the North Caucasus and was in talks with the terrorists, as well as with the officer of the “B” FSB of Russia Vyacheslav Bocharov.
What stunned me when I was working on this topic was that it was as if there had been no such ten years in Beslan.
This topic is extremely painful for everyone who has anything to do with it, people hardly agree to talk about what happened.
The impressions of the trip are very heavy.
But it is impossible to forget Beslan, and I hope that we have managed our task,” Antonova said.
The special project is prepared by the infographic studio of the holding Rambler & Co, which has been working in the company since spring this year.
Previous special projects were devoted to the First World War and the 15th anniversary of Vladimir Putin's rule.
North Korea launches short-range missile
North Korea has launched a short-range missile into the waters of the Sea of Japan, reports "Renhaap".
The launch was carried out around 10:30 a.m. local time from the province of Chagando, which is on the border between North Korea and China.
It is believed that the missile fell into the Sea of Japan, flying about 220 km, the Joint Committee of Chiefs of Staff of South Korea said.
MEPs propose to speed up the entry into force of the law on personal data
If the initiative succeeds, the data of Russians will not be stored on servers abroad from January 1, 2015.
The State Duma has submitted a draft law, which provides for the transfer of the date of entry into force of the already adopted law on personal data of Russians - from September 1, 2016 to January 1, 2015.
The initiative is placed in the legislative activity base of the lower house.
Its authors were Deputies of the State Duma Vadim Dengin, Yaroslav Nilov (LDPR), Yevgeny Fedorov (United Russia), Vladimir Parakhin (Just Russia) and Alexander Yushchenko (KPRF).
Such a change, according to the authors of the initiative, will contribute to a more prompt and effective provision of the rights of citizens of the Russian Federation to the preservation of personal data and compliance with the secret of correspondence in information and telecommunications networks.
The law, the entry into force of which is rushing parliamentarians, obliges to store on the territory of the Russian Federation the personal data of Russians processed through the Internet.
It also makes compulsory the recording, systematization, accumulation, storage, clarification and extraction of personal data of citizens of the Russian Federation in databases located on the territory of the Russian Federation, as well as the indication of information on the location of such databases.
In addition, the law grants Roskomnadzor the right, on the basis of a court decision, to restrict access to information processed in violation of the legislation of the Russian Federation in the field of personal data.
The law also proposes the creation of the so-called "black lists" of violating sites - an automated information system "Register of violators of the rights of personal data subjects".
The law was passed by the State Duma in the summer.
The authors of the bill were Andrei Lugovoy and Vadim Dengin from the LDPR and Alexander Yushchenko from the KPRF.
Dengin and Yushchenko are also among the authors of the current bill on the postponement of the date of entry into force of the already adopted law.
Those who do not have data centers in the Russian Federation will have to pay the rent.
Commenting on the bill submitted to the State Duma today, the first deputy head of the Duma Committee on Information Policy Leonid Levin said that he does not see problems to postpone the date of entry into force of the law on the protection of personal data.
According to him, those companies that by January 1, 2015 will not have their own storage of personal data of Russians on the territory of the Russian Federation, will be able to rent them, for example, "from Rostelecom, which has repeatedly said that they are ready to provide their servers in lease and already provides their servers, from Mail Group, from Western companies, which today already provide their servers."
“There are also several independent data centers ready to cooperate in this area,” he added.
"If companies decide to comply with the law and continue to operate in the territory of the Russian Federation, I do not see problems - they will get technological capabilities for placement," Levin summed up.
Controversial bill
Immediately after the publication of the bill, the Russian Association of Electronic Communications expressed concern that if the bill was passed, Russians would no longer be able to use many global internet services.
In particular, we are talking about online booking of air tickets and hotels.
According to the association, “the bill deprives subjects of personal data – citizens of the Russian Federation of the right to dispose of their own data imperatively determining that their recording, systematization, etc. should be provided only in databases located on the territory of the Russian Federation”.
The statement emphasizes that a more effective measure would be the creation of a mechanism to inform the user about where the recording is carried out, the systematization of his personal data.
In this case, it will be able to choose on which territory these actions will be carried out.
The adoption of similar bills on the "localization" of personal data in other countries has led to the departure of global services and to significant economic losses.
The participant of the test with the ice water hole pulled out the jaw
Isabelle Roberts from the UK shouted so much when ice water was poured on her head that it damaged the bone structure of her face.
This test with the ice water cage went to the pain not so.
The woman was hospitalized after she cried so much during the ice-water test that she swung her jaw.
Isabelle Roberts screamed so fiercely when ice water was poured on her head that it damaged the structure of her face.
“The water was so cold that I screamed, but when I did, my jaw started to get stuck,” she told The Mirror.
Water for 20 years.
Isabelle Roberts seconds before the accident
I tried to close my mouth, but it didn’t close, it stuck, and then I realized something was wrong.
Then my mother and sister came to the same understanding and they started whispering, but I had to be taken to the emergency department.
A 20-year-old woman from the UK was taken to a hospital to fix her jaw after participating in a popular hobby on Tuesday.
The clip became an internet sensation and was posted thousands of times on Facebook and Twitter.
Ukrainian army handed over 400 prisoners
In the "Army of Novorossiya" claim that they shot down the Ukrainian Su-27, and accuse the enemy of violating the ceasefire agreement.
As of 10 a.m. on September 1, the militias handed over 402 prisoners to the Ukrainian side, 72 of whom were wounded, as well as the bodies of 35 soldiers killed.
This was by the press service of the "Army of Novorossiya".
He added that "the air defense forces in the area of the settlement of Mereshka shot down the Su-27 aircraft, which violated the ceasefire agreement."
According to the interlocutor of the agency, the Ukrainian side during the artillery shelling of the Luhansk airport used casket ammunition prohibited by international conventions.
A spokesman for the press service noted that the militiamen overnight managed to damage two helicopters of the Ukrainian Air Force at one of the field airfields, as well as destroy two armored carriers and two warehouses with ammunition.
"The losses in the enemy's live force - up to a hundred people killed and wounded, 13 people surrendered to captivity," the representative of the headquarters summed up.
"Interfax" has no confirmation of this information from Ukrainian sources.
On Sunday, the armed formations of the “people’s republics” of Donbass announced the transfer of 223 prisoners and soldiers of the National Guard of Ukraine to the Ukrainian side as part of the ceasefire regime.
At the same time, the army of the DPR, according to the "Army of Novorossiya", "prevented the attempt of the National Guards in violation of previously reached agreements to withdraw heavy equipment from the surrounding area".
Then the militias the destruction in a rapid battle of two tanks and two BMP, the seizure of six tanks and the disarmament of 198 soldiers.
According to the headquarters, total enemy losses in all directions (Donetsk, Luhansk, Mariupol) for that night amounted to five tanks, eight combat armored vehicles, more than 120 people killed and wounded.
At the end of last week, a large group of Ukrainian soldiers was surrounded by militias in the Ilovaysk area in the Donetsk region.
Russian President Vladimir Putin has asked the leadership of the "people's republics" to release Ukrainian soldiers from the siege.
The DPR agreed to do so on condition that the enemy handed over weapons and ammunition.
The first dozens of soldiers began to leave the surrounded settlements on Saturday morning.
According to the commander of the encircled Ukrainian territorial defense battalion "Donbass" Semen Semenchenko, in the night of Sunday from the "cottle" went out another 14 people.
In his Facebook post, Semenchenko wrote that the Ukrainian wounded are "in captivity at the 137 regiment of the 32rd division of the Russian Federation and 9 tank brigades of the Russian Federation", where they are treated well.
Meanwhile, the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Defense have denied reports by the Ukrainian military and NATO about the presence of Russian units in Ukraine.
Russian Foreign Ministry: Russia will take retaliatory measures if EU imposes new sanctions
Russia reserves the right to take retaliatory measures aimed at protecting its legitimate interests in the event of the introduction of new anti-Russian sanctions.
The Russian Foreign Ministry said in a statement that the “conclusions” of the European Council on August 30 demonstrated the inability of EU member states to overcome the inertia of their reckless support for the Kiev authorities.
Brussels continues to insist that Russia is involved in the situation in eastern Ukraine, relying on "absolutely unproven claims about the presence of Russian armed forces on the territory of this country," the ministry's website said.
The Russian Foreign Ministry regrets that the European Council, contrary to the interests of its member states, is subject to the influence of countries that are interested in strengthening the confrontation with Russia.
The members of the European Council should call for a peaceful settlement of the conflict in eastern Ukraine, as well as provide conditions for a full-fledged "dialogue between the opposing parties", the ministry stresses.
There are currently no objective estimates of the humanitarian situation in Donbas, where a full-scale humanitarian catastrophe has unfolded, and the number of civilian casualties is growing.
During the next seven days in the European Union is planned to develop specific proposals on sanctions against Russia.
At the same time, EU representatives cooperate closely with American officials.
It is expected that they will correlate between the measures introduced by the period of action and the degree of rigidity.
The new EU sanctions could affect the energy and financial sector.
The Australian government has also announced the expansion of sanctions against Russia in the fields of defense, finance and the oil and gas industry.
Smart Ways to Save on University Books
While the cost of university textbooks for many students exceeds $1,000 a year, Matt Schroeder, who is soon to move to a second degree, has come up with a clever way to cut costs.
He developed a system of how to rent books from high school students, offering them a nominal compensation so that they could postpone their sale.
“My mathematical analysis textbook, which usually costs $180, I got for a semester for $10 and a “Chick-fil-A” cookie,” says Schroeder, 19, who is studying at Covenant College in Georgia.
The required literature for the past semester would cost $430, he says.
He spent $120.
According to the College Council, an average student spends more than $1,200 a year on textbooks and study supplies, but students have a number of options to cut those costs.
Students are increasingly choosing online shops and creative ideas like Schroeder’s system.
Book rental is becoming increasingly popular, allowing students to use a book for a semester, and is often considerably cheaper than buying them.
Nibo Incorporated, which owns more than 250 university bookstores, reports that book rental has doubled since 2011.
Industry research shows that about a quarter of the books in university bookstores were rented during the last spring semester, says Nibo vice president Trevor Meyer.
Less than half of all books are purchased in university bookstores, according to the National Association of University Stores.
Here is an introductory course on the best ways to make a profitable deal.
Buying in the Internet Shop
Sometimes, if you go online, the price of a new book can be one-third of what you see in a university bookstore.
The ninth edition of "Mathematical Analysis" by Ron Larson, Bruce Edwards and Robert Hosteler costs about $290 per price, but the new copy can be purchased for $239.99 on Chegg.com, which specializes in selling textbooks.
Purchase of used
If you are not against someone else’s marks or damage, used textbooks are a good option.
"Mathematical Analysis" is sold for $93.49 in used form on Chegg.com.
Matt Casey, 25, a fourth-graduate student at Brigham Young University, says he paid 42 cents on Amazon.com for a used copy of the textbook "Strategic Media Solutions: Understanding the Business Side of Advertising".
The book was sold for $48.
Teachers, such as Ingrid Breissy, director of the “College Without Walls” at the University of Massachusetts in Emherst, suggest that students clarify with their professors whether they can use previous editions.
Sometimes updates are unimportant for classes.
In such cases, old editions can often be found for a very small percentage of the cost of the latest edition.
In addition to Chegg and Amazon, Half.com, owned by eBay Inc., is a popular alternative to buying used books.
rented
It is worth thinking about renting textbooks, if you are going to handle them well enough, don’t forget to return them and don’t want to leave them for yourself after the course is over.
You can save more than 80% of the cost of a new book.
For example, one student was able to rent "Mathematical Analysis" for a semester for about $20.
Find out the rules of the store where you take the books, including any penalties you may be charged for marking, highlighting and damaging.
If you rent a book, remember: if you do not return the book, the fines may even exceed the cost of the new copy.
Electronic books
E-books instead of traditional textbooks are another option.
Sometimes such books are actually rented by purchasing an electronic license for a certain period from distributors such as Amazon.com, Chegg and Barnes & Noble Inc.
The “Mathematical Analysis” rental on Chegg.com for six months will cost approximately $61.
Breezey says that literature students can often find the most favorable prices, as many classical works are now available for free, while literature in the natural and engineering sciences can be quite expensive.
No matter what, look at it.
Joe Gold, 29, who is about to start studying at Pepperdine Law School, recommends using an ISBN number to find out the price of a book, as this ensures that you are looking for exactly the text you need.
Before ordering online, Gold says, be sure to check if the book is actually in stock.
This lesson was not easy for him.
The delivery of the book he purchased was postponed for four weeks, and eventually he paid the full price at the university bookstore.
Putin says the Far East Development Fund is inefficient
Russian President Vladimir Putin revealed at a meeting on state support for priority investment projects and territories in the Far East that the budget investment fund for the development of the Far East, created two years ago, is ineffective.
“15 billion rubles remained on deposits,” the president said.
During the meeting, the head of state instructed to accelerate the approval of the list of territories ahead of development in the Far East.
He reminded that the draft law necessary for the creation of TORs should be submitted to the State Duma this autumn.
The Federal Assembly, the president noted, until July 1 has not approved the list of territories of advanced development in the Far East, and their criteria.
Vladimir Putin also formulated the main tasks for ensuring the development of the Far East.
Among them, increasing the transport accessibility of the region, removing infrastructure restrictions - both on the domestic market and for the development of exports.
Among other things, it is necessary to create prerequisites for attracting additional investment in the region, as well as to form areas of advanced development, which should become competitive in relation to the key business centers of the ATR, the president stressed.
Recall, previously that the territory of advanced development can replace the OECD.
Why the Guardians of the Galaxy failed to save cash fees
Sylvester Stallone’s “Unstoppable 3” returned less than $30 million from his $90 million U.S. budget, while “City of Sins: A Woman Worth Killing” returned only $12 million from its $70 million budget.
"Home Video" with Cameron Diaz made only $14.6 million in the first weekend, while children's films like How to Train a Dragon 2 also disappointed in revenue.
The Telegraph film critic Robbie Collin’s article points out that when it comes to children’s films, it may be a bad quality of the films themselves.
Collin called 2014 the "worst" year in history in terms of children's films, and called "How to Train a Dragon 2" a barely "functioning" continuation of fantasy.
However, when it comes to films aimed at a slightly older audience, it seems that the problem does not necessarily lie as the films themselves.
In July, Entertainment Weekly compared the average CinemaScore and Metacritic ratings of each film released in the summer in at least 2,000 copies between the Memorial Day holiday in May and July 20, for 2013 and for that year.
The results, which take into account the opinion of both movie viewers and film critics, suggest that this year’s film harvest is similar in caliber to last year’s hits.
Some commentators suggest that the matter may be in changing viewing habits and the growing popularity of streaming internet services such as Netflix.
Director John Favreau, who is currently working on the upcoming Disney movie The Jungle Book, told the Hollywood Reporter website: “I think times are changing.”
We must acknowledge this and not try to pursue what was before.
In contrast to the current fall in cash fees in Hollywood, Netflix’s revenue from streaming service reached $1.2 billion, almost doubling last year’s $837 million.
Last summer, director Steven Spielberg criticized the studios for relying too much on comic book franchises and predicted the “crash” of Hollywood.
In the light of the current downturn, some commentators argue that there was a portion of truth in his dark predictions.
With several potential cash hits expected to be released in the summer of 2015, including Avengers: Age of Altron, Minions and Jurassic Park, other representatives of the film industry are more optimistic.
X-Men producer Simon Kinberg recently called the fall in cash fees simply “cyclical,” saying to Hollywood Reporter: “The next summer will be the most cash summer in history, and nobody will worry about it.”
Product sanctions do not scare owners of establishments with Caucasian and Central Asian food, but for restaurants of European and Japanese cuisine, Russian suppliers are a terrible dream.
Generally speaking, it is preferable to replace the prohibited imports with products not from Russia, but from Latin America, Israel and China.
“It’s better to eat a low-salted cucumbers than a bad mozzarella,” says Italian chef Mariano Valerio at the Barlotti restaurant about the quality of cheeses that suppliers offer him in exchange for Italian cheeses.
Mozarella and burrito cheese ended up in the restaurant first, they have a short shelf life.
The reserves of parmesan should be enough for a few more months.
What to do?
Moving to Russian?
In 2005, I was at the Drogomilovsky Market.
Mariano Valerio makes such eyes that it is clear: shocking memories do not let him go so far.
The meat was lying on the chariots just 30 centimeters from the floor!
There are cats!
The rats !
Then I said that for our restaurant we will never buy anything in the Russian markets.
I don’t know, maybe it has changed now.
But a day ago I was brought to try fish from the Far East.
She turned out to be dumb!
I said I didn’t even want to talk to the person who brought it to us.
Valerio is surprised that many common things for Italy for the Russian manufacturer are strange.
A few years ago I was forced to buy Russian beef.
In Italy, the meat is kept in the refrigerator for 10 days at a temperature of 1-2 degrees.
It should hang out to become soft so that the muscles relax.
I did it with local beef.
Then I was asked: Where did you get that sweet meat?
I said, this is yours, Russian!
Why doesn’t anyone do that with you?
A five-minute walk from Barlotti in the French restaurant "Brasserie Bridge" in the kitchen hangs a stop-list, which indicates the missing products: French oysters, seafood.
The chef of the restaurant "Brasserie Bridge" and the bar "Strelka" Regis Trigel is not as pessimistic as Valerio: oysters from France have already replaced with oysters from Tunisia, and instead of French cheeses, the restaurant will buy Swiss.
However, Regis becomes more emotional when it comes to Russian suppliers: "Colored cabbage - 200 rubles!
I ask, “Why, on what basis is it worth so much?”
They say, “We also need to make money.”
But this cabbage should not cost more than 80 rubles!
Far Eastern oysters we buy by weight, but they live 15-20 years, can you imagine how much their armor weighs?
At the price it turns out to be a super delicacy.
It seems that Russian suppliers are one of the main sources of scary foods for foreign chefs.
Standard story: “The first three months everything was fine, then the quality dropped sharply.”
The main claims: Russian suppliers cannot withstand stable caliber and quality.
Many European restaurants don’t know what will happen to them when their cheese stocks run out.

Sanctions menu
On August 6, President Vladimir Putin signed a decree on the application of certain economic measures to ensure the security of Russia, which are called mainly food sanctions.
It is forbidden to import beef, pork, meat and poultry by-products, meat delicacies, fish, molluscs, milk, yogurts, cheese, cheeses, vegetables, fruits, nuts, sausages and sugar syrups.
Restaurants have started a clash with suppliers: prices for products have risen, you need to urgently look for analogues from other countries.
Most of this will affect the expensive restaurants with monocoque of France, Italy, Spain, to which the products were delivered directly from the "mother" countries.
The public had to rebuild earlier.
For example, when in early 2014, the Rosselkhoznadzor banned the import of Australian beef, and a year earlier - American and Canadian meat.
In return, the suppliers set up supplies of beef from Argentina, Uruguay and New Zealand.
But the sanctions for the summer of 2014 were much more severe.
However, on August 20, Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev approved amendments to the presidential decree, which remove from the ban of salmon salmon and forel, lactose-free milk, seed potatoes, sugar corn, peanuts and onions for sowing.
Italy’s Valerio hopes sanctions could be eased further.
For now, some restaurants exist in conditions of uncertainty.
According to East-West, one of the largest HoReCa suppliers, the share of imported products in the premium segment was up to 70%.
"Drop restaurants will have to change their menus to what local farmers and other countries produce," says Sergey Mironov, a restaurant owner and owner of Restkonsalt.
If the chef is strong, it will not be a problem for him.
Only we have very few such chefs, and it can take two to three months to develop a new menu.
Trigel from the restaurant "Brasserie Bridge" is ready for this: you will have to give up 10-15% of dishes, another half of the menu - to process.
In restaurants with mixed cuisine already begin to replace dishes, such as marble beef steaks - with befstrogan, says Sergey Mironov.
Cheeses from Europe can be replaced with Russian, Belarusian cheeses, cheeses from Serbia, Argentina, Tunisia, Chile, - lists the representative of the company "East-West" Oksana Glybchuk.
Strawberries and dairy products from Europe have analogues in Russia and Belarus.
Chicken from the U.S. can be replaced with chicken from Russia and Belarus, salmon and seed from Norway - salmon, seed, chicken from Belarus and Chile.
The lack of fruits and vegetables of European production can be compensated by the products of domestic producers, offers from Serbia, Moldova and China.
According to Mironov, the budget network of restaurants will be easier to rebuild than the premium segment: it is unlikely that there were gourmets who were able to distinguish Italian Mozarella from Russian.
Although it will be difficult for the Ginza Project institutions, he believes.
Ginza Project has several dozen restaurants under different brands and with their own menus.
It will take a lot of time to replace," says Mironov.
Ginza declined to comment, citing the absence of owners in the country.
Owners of cafes of Caucasian and Central Asian cuisine emphasize that the products from the former Soviet republics smell better than European ones.
But there are a lot of restaurants that the sanctions will hardly affect.
These include establishments with the cuisine of the CIS countries: Georgian, Uzbek, Armenian and Azerbaijani.
“There are no expensive foods in Georgian cuisine,” says Khatuna Kolbaja, the owner of the Georgian restaurant Saperavi and the “Wai Mai!” cafe.
All the cheeses for us are made in Russia, the basis of many dishes - chicken filet, exotic greens we do not use.
No meals have yet been removed from the menu.
Timur Lansky, the owner of restaurants "Chaikhona N1" with Uzbek cuisine, the sanctions are also not embarrassing: he will only have to change lambs for New Zealand.
If Russia sets up imports from Uzbekistan, Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan, we will even win in price, for us it will be cheaper than imports from Europe, he says.
From the CIS, you can get cutting, lamb, tomatoes, cucumbers, fruits cheaper.
At the same time, what is imported from Central Asia is much better than "plastic" from Italy, Spain and Turkey.
Everyone knows about Uzbek tomatoes that they are delicious, sweet.
No one says that about Spanish.
After the imposition of sanctions, the representative of the Ministry of Agriculture of Uzbekistan Olymba Artykov said that he plans to increase the export of fruit and vegetables to Russia by half by 2016.
Belarus and Kazakhstan announced their intention to replace European imports to Russia almost immediately after the imposition of sanctions.
Fast food restaurants, which responded to the request of "Money", also react quite calmly to the sanctions.
McDonald’s said the localization exceeds 85% and the network works with 160 Russian suppliers.
According to Tatyana Bogdanova, head of the Subway Russia Supplier Department, about 80% of the products are purchased in Russia, although temporary difficulties with the supply of vegetables and rising prices for meat products that are produced from imported raw materials may arise.
In "Teremka" "sanction products" generally occupied no more than 4%.
They did not touch the sanctions and the "Vocker".
KFC, Burger King and Little Potatoes did not respond to the money request, but other market participants claim that Burger King is significantly less localized than McDonald's.
In the absence of Norwegian fish, restaurants are willing to buy Chilean rather than Russian Far East fish.
On his horse.
Meanwhile, restaurants complain that due to increased demand, prices are rising even for local products.
"The prices for the products for the Grable rose on average by 10-15%, for the Italian restaurant Cherry Mio - twice," says the restaurant manager Roman Rožnikovsky.
Even in Georgian restaurants, the cost of dishes will rise by 5-10%, Kolbaja acknowledges.
"East-West" does not deny this: "For example, Belarusian dairy products have risen by 10-15% since the beginning of August."
“Brazilian suppliers have almost doubled the price of pork,” Sergey Rak, Deputy CEO of Stardogs, complains.
The chicken price increased by 35%.
We expect prices from China, maybe they will cool the Brazilian heads.
In the near future, Stardogs will have a planned price increase of 8%.
Now it is very undesirable to raise prices, says Cancer.
According to statistics, the growth of food revenues for the second quarter of 2014 - only 1.8%.
This is the lowest figure since 2010.
Retail prices will continue to rise, he acknowledges, but it’s unclear how quickly: so far most restaurants have stockpiled for the next two months in the hope of waiting for the drop in purchasing prices.
But what will happen in two months, nobody knows.
On the square in front of the Moscow City Hall stands a dozen tents decorated with green and wood.
In the middle of the stage, the musicians play waltz.
This is a festival of regional products with the fun title "There is a time to eat".
"We were going to make a celebration of local food for a long time, and here are the sanctions, we rushed, organized the festival," one of the organizers says.
Behind the stage with musicians, the Greek chef Anastas prepares a salad of pasta and homemade candy, and there was a master class on the preparation of borst with caramelized apples.
All Russian products, the organizers assure.
Exhibition of achievements of the Russian national economy.
Honey from Bashkiria, herring from Salehard, vegetables from the sub-Moscow "Lenin Council", cheeses from the stunned Italian Jay Clause.
“Restaurant salmon can safely be replaced by another salmon fish from the Far East,” says Philip Galkin, owner of the fish shop “Sine People.”
We catch the nerve, ketu, kijucha, gorbucha, chavych - the "royal salmon".
Yes, they’re not as fat as Norwegian salmon, because it’s a wild fish.
Norwegian salmon is aquaculture.
You take him in your hands – he doesn’t even move.
And our Far Eastern salmon you will not hold in your hands.
Only institutions without special claims agree to replace the Italian Mozzarella with the domestic
In the vitrine of his tent lie shrimp with the label "Magadan", shrimp, omul, muxus, midi from Crimea, shrimp from the Far East.
Galkin is confident that it is time to switch to fishing from the Far East.
According to statistics, the catch of fish in Russia in 2013 - more than 4 million tons, a significant part of the fish goes to Japan, Korea and even the United States.
Fish imports in 2013 - about 800 thousand tons.
The shop "Our People" has been operating since 2012, selling fish through an online store, before the introduction of sanctions served another half a dozen restaurants, such as "Simple Things".
Currently, 15 other restaurants have submitted requests for Galkin.
The same sushi can be made from our fish, it is hot.
We went out and tried different recipes.
Now we sell sushi through an online store for a million rubles a month.
Our fish is cheaper several times, and delivery is a maximum of 15 rubles per kilogram.
As a confirmation in Galkin's tent, I am prepared a portion of "Philadelphia" with keto.
Unlike the rolls with the samba, these have to chew longer, but the awareness that this fish is our, domestic, gives strength.
On the site of the store "Our people" there are even rolls of coat and sea coat.
In sushi bars, however, to replace Norwegian salmon prefer chilean.
Galkin explains this by the fact that chefs are lazy to come up with new recipes with Far Eastern fish.
"Russian fish suppliers have not yet offered us," explains Killfish Bar owner Dmitry Evseev.
Approximately the same situation with other products: Russian manufacturers could occupy the liberated niche, but this is not the case.
According to the founder and co-owner of the LavkaLavka project Boris Akimov, we can now talk about replacing imports from Europe and America with imports from China, Israel and Latin America.
There are large transnational corporations with powerful logistics and large volumes.
They are able to quickly replace banned imports unlike our farmers.
That is, large producers of other countries will benefit first of all from the ban,” Akimov said.
However, in the last month, the restaurant industry received a more alarming signal than the food sanctions.
Rospotrebnadzor has suspended the activities of three McDonald's enterprises in Moscow and two regional enterprises in Stavropol and Yekaterinburg.
“We are investigating the substance of the claims to determine the actions needed to open restaurants to visitors as soon as possible,” McDonald’s said in a statement.
Actually no one knows what will happen next.
If everything is limited to food sanctions, this is one option that can be survived, says an employee of a company engaged in restaurant consulting on condition of anonymity.
If McDonald’s starts to shut down across the country, the scenario will be quite different.
“Europrotokoll” instead of the GIBD certificate
Payments on casco can be obtained without the certificate of GIBDD - so the Central Bank intends to stimulate the introduction in Russia of the "Europrotokoll".
The Bank of Russia has developed a draft directives, according to which from September 1 this year to receive payments on casco insured car driver will be able to do without a certificate of GIBDD.
It is true that this is only the case when the accident was registered according to the "Europrotokoll" without the involvement of the road police.
That is, if only two cars were involved in the accident, there are no physically injured persons, the damage does not exceed the established limit and both drivers reached an agreement on the question of who is responsible for the accident.
From 2 August, the limit of payments under the Euro Protocol is 50 thousand rubles, and from 1 October in Moscow, St. Petersburg, as well as in the Moscow and Leningrad regions it will be raised to 400 thousand rubles.
The point is that often even with minor injuries, in a situation where an accident can be issued according to the "Europrotokoll", drivers who have been in an accident, cause a DPS.
After all, in the presence of a casco policy, it was impossible to obtain compensation for it without a certificate of GIBDD.
The parameters prescribed in the draft directive are intended to eliminate this obstacle to the implementation of the “Europrotokoll” in Russia.
According to them, the maximum payment on casco in connection with an accident, issued without employees of the GIBDD, should not be lower than the limit under the "Europrotokoll".
But at the same time, it can not be above the limit specified in the Casco insurance contract.
The idea, of course, is useful and theoretically capable of unloading both DPS staff and the road.
But, most likely, neither car drivers nor insurers will be delighted with it.
The latter already speaks of a serious threat to the growth of fraud, which could lead to the introduction of new casco payments rules.
As for drivers, it is difficult to imagine what work will have to be done to overcome the original Russian conservatism.
The driver in most cases will be waiting for hours for the inspector to form a minor accident, because it is more reliable.
And it is not yet known what will be easier - to defeat the fraudsters or to convince drivers of the reliability of the "Europrotokoll".
The savings certificate will be named and irrevocable
The Ministry of Finance wants to ban savings certificates on the applicant, but will allow banks to make them an analogue of the irrevocable contribution.
The Ministry of Finance is preparing a bill that will prohibit savings certificates for the applicant.
Recently, this tool is gaining popularity, as rates here are higher than on bank deposits.
The fact is that savings certificates for the applicant do not fall into the deposit insurance system, and they cost the bank cheaper, since there is no need to make deductions to the Deposit Insurance Agency (ASV) fund.
The pitch of the situation is that this step is planned to be taken because of small and medium-sized banks distributing such certificates, and Sberbank and Bank of Moscow will suffer from it, which, according to the estimates of ASV, control 98% of the profile market.
Moreover, the share of the Bank of Moscow, according to estimates of the agency, is about 3.5%.
The problem, explained in the ASV, is that clients of a small bank, who bought such a certificate, in case of withdrawal of licenses from it try to get money in the ASV.
Some depositors, not having sufficient financial literacy and buying savings certificates on the depository, may assume that their investments are insured.
Justified absence of insurance payments on these certificates in case of withdrawal of the license from the bank can lead to misunderstanding and social tension.
In the practice of the agency there have been cases when holders of applicant certificates tried to collect insurance compensation through the court", - stated in the ASV.
The problem is, of course, invented.
After all, no one will pay the buyers of certificates anyway, since they have no right to compensation from the state according to the law.
If it were that the instrument was not insured in the ASV, along with it would be banned and metal accounts, on which the funds of citizens are accounted in grams of one of the four metals - gold, silver, platinum and palladium.
After all, these accounts also do not fall into the deposit insurance system, but no one attempts to exist yet.
The fact, most likely, is that certificates on the applicant are a very convenient securities, which can actually act as a quaside money.
At the same time, their movement is virtually uncontrollable: any client of the bank can buy a certificate, transfer it to any citizen, and before the liquidation of such a certificate can change many owners.
It is not by chance that the bill stipulates that the savings certificate must be a nominal securities, which should be stored in the depository.
And to sweeten the pill to banks, such certificates are allowed to issue without the right to early repayment.
That is, the analogue of the irrevocable contribution that banks have long dreamed of is introduced.
NATO Summit: First Protests in Newport and Cardiff
On the weekend, there were protests of those who spoke against the NATO summit in Newport.
On Saturday, hundreds gathered in the center of Newport to march against NATO.
And on Sunday in Cardiff, about 150 people gathered near the town hall of Cardiff for what was described as an anti-summit.
For us, Stephen Fairclaw followed the developments over the weekend and spoke to the protesters who came from everywhere: from Bridget to Belgium.
Germany to send 30 anti-tank systems to Iraq
Germany will supply weapons to Iraq to counter the militants of the Islamic State terrorist group, ITAR-TASS reports on August 31 with reference to the decision taken after a meeting of representatives of the German government headed by Chancellor Angela Merkel.
As, Germany will send to Iraq 30 portable anti-tank missile systems "Milan" and 500 tanks to them, as well as 8 thousand G3 and G36 assault rifles.
Deliveries will be made until the end of September.
In addition, it has decided to allocate an additional €50 million in humanitarian aid to Iraq.
On September 1, Ms. Merkel will speak to the Bundestag with a government statement on this subject.
So far, Germany has not supplied its weapons to "hot spots".
Opinions of German citizens about sending weapons to Iraq were divided.
Some believe that this is the only way to stop the fighters of the "Islamic State", others fear that this weapon may eventually fall into the hands of terrorists.
Ukrainian military bombed a patrol boat in the Sea of Azov
Donetsk militias destroyed a Ukrainian patrol boat in the Sea of Azov, ITAR-TASS on August 31.
According to available data, this occurred in the Taganrog Gulf near the settlements of Shirokino and Bezimenno (10-20 km east of Mariupol).
A number of Ukrainian media reports about the shelling of two boats of the coast guard.
It is specified that the incident occurred today around 16:20 Moscow.
Children taken by helicopter from the Blue Mountains
Two teenagers were transported by helicopter to a safe place after spending the night stuck in the Blue Mountains of New South Wales.
A 16-year-old girl and an 18-year-old man went on a march shortly after noon on Sunday to Goetts Lip in Blackheath.
Concerned relatives called the police around 8 p.m. when they did not return home.
A search team consisting of local police and rescue team was sent and the couple was found around 11 p.m. near the Bridal Valley waterfall.
The girl injured her knee, and the young man fell and struck his head.
The officers stayed with the couple for the night, and were picked up on a swamp on Monday morning.
They were taken by ambulance in a stable condition to the Blue Mountain Hospital.
Two unions meet.
The summit talks in Minsk did not solve the problems for which they were convened, but gave rise to a new format: the first persons of the European Union met with the first persons of the future of the Eurasian Union.
Even on an alarming occasion (the situation around Ukraine does not tolerate delays), the leaders of the EU and the Customs Union for the first time discussed a number of "hot problems".
Whether such a structure is capable of working effectively is unclear, but it is clear who removed the cream from this summit.
Questions on this account fell off on the evening of August 26, when Belarusians, and followed by them and other Eurasians with Europeans saw in the television news of the new president Lukashenko.
The Belarusian leader was an example of refined politeness, it was the behavior of a man who just broke the jackpot – and is planning a decent old age in the higher society.
How Maidan Lukashenko helped
The arrival in Minsk of three main European Commissioners (EU ministers) who met with Lukashenko and allowed him to speak at the final briefing on their behalf is not just the legitimation of the president with a 20-year experience.
This is an application to recognize Minsk as a full-fledged subject of European policy and the main mediator of the Ukrainian crisis.
Senior analyst of the Belarusian Institute of Strategic Studies Denis Melyancov is confident that from now on Brussels will not be able to talk with Minsk in the same tone as before.
“The fact that Catherine Ashton met t-a-tet with Lukashenko gives grounds to believe that relations with the EU will be freezed up further,” he said.
This iceberg has a hidden part: preparations for the breakthrough the Belarusian authorities began long before the November Maidan in Kiev - in the summer of 2013.
"There were results achieved with the EU - successful negotiations on the simplification of the visa regime and readmission, dialogue on modernization, - lists the interlocutor "Ogonka", - and with the US were held negotiations on international security.
The United States even lifted some sanctions.
As for the Ukrainian events, they themselves and the reaction of the Belarusian leadership to them only blasted this process.
Minsk, on the one hand, managed to maintain relations with Ukraine - warm enough not to lose much in mutual trade, and President Poroshenko could come to Belarus for negotiations.
On the other hand, the Belarusian leader, who de jure did not recognize the annexation of Crimea to Russia and called for the punishment of pro-Russian militias in the Donbass with all severity, did not argue with Moscow.
Minsk did not leave the Customs Union or the CSTO, and the Russian air base is located in Baranovich.
Brussels and Washington noted the balanced position of Minsk on the Ukrainian issue – and assessed it, Belarusian experts are confident.
How successful Lukashenko’s movement towards political diversification will be, will be seen by how often in the near future Minsk will have to hold meetings in the EU+TS format.
In the press service of the EU’s High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Diplomacy Catherine Ashton failed to respond promptly to questions about what Brussels expects from relations in the new format.
Ashton spokeswoman Maya Kosyanchich only stated to “Foganka” that in the context of resolving the issues of war and peace, this topic is not a priority.
At the same time, reports appeared that the next meeting place on the Ukrainian issue with the participation of the first persons in the new format could become Kazakhstan.
The drop of thickness for Minsk was the statement of President Nursultan Nazarbayev, in which he admitted that he was personally asked by representatives of the European Union.
However, at the final briefing, Alexander Lukashenko made it clear that all sides do not mind that Minsk remains the central venue for meetings in the format Russia-OSCE-Ukraine, as well as at the level of heads of state and high representatives of the European Commission.
This means that “the last dictator of Europe” gains the status of a very hands-on European leader who helps solve a global problem.
The best friend of the farmer
Already the composition of the EU delegation, which included the European Commissioners for Trade and Energy, pushed to the conclusion: the main background of the summit is not the tragic situation in the Donbass, but the economy.
In fact, the schedule of future negotiations on gas supplies and overcoming the concerns of the CIS countries over the association agreement between Ukraine and the EU, set out at the meeting, seems to be a greater achievement than peace declarations without specific dates and figures.
Trade Commissioner Carl De Gucht, however, noted that EU representatives “comed to Minsk to look for a solution to the political crisis that has economic consequences, not the opposite.”
It seems, however, that in the economy the crisis in Ukraine is "working" for Belarus.
Its consequences – and in the first place the mutual sanctions of the West and Russia – give Minsk, which is currently experiencing sanctional pressure, a long-awaited field for manoeuvre.
According to the head of the Research Center Mises, former candidate for President of Belarus Yaroslav Romanchuk, European investors are actively interested in the possibilities of Belarus to supply agricultural products to the Russian Federation in circumvention of sanctions.
At the same time, supply schemes are being put forward, for which Vladimir Putin has rushed Minsk at the summit.
“The initiators of these schemes are not Belarusian businessmen, but Russian companies.
They have long worked out schemes for the supply of goods, including from Poland, Germany, Lithuania, and today these schemes are destroyed.
Russian business urgently needs to rebuild them, even through the mediation of Belarusian structures.
The second plot, continues the expert, is related to the fact that many Ukrainian companies are reluctant to set up production in Belarus from Ukrainian raw materials also with an orientation to the Russian market.
Ukrainian producers have about $4 billion of exports to Russia, and Belarusian production and trade schemes can now be very in demand.
According to Romanchuk, the role of host of the platform for negotiations between the EU and the EU is ideal for Lukashenko and in terms of the development of economic ties with Europe.
He reminds that the losses of the EU agricultural sector from the sanctions of Moscow are estimated at 5-10 billion euros, and the European Commission has currently offered agricultors only 125 million euros in compensation.
The Belarusian president may offer Brussels to work together to minimize the consequences for European farmers.
This could raise the authority of Lukashenko in the EU to an unprecedented height.
Hospitality without initiative
Catherine Ashton thanked the Belarusian authorities for the initiative to hold the summit.
But the paradox is that the official Minsk from its active role in the birth of the TS+EU format is crucified, and the Belarusian leader at the meeting with the Ukrainian colleague stressed that the initiator of the new format and all became Kiev.
"It was your proposal to gather, without any incursion to discuss, not from the bay to take a decision, after the signing of the Association Treaty with the EU, to understand the situation that at the time was developing in Ukraine," he addressed Petro Poroshenko in front of the cameras.
However, observers interpreted this as an attempt to calm Moscow, which, according to rumors, was initially against the mediation of Minsk, which greatly increases its political weight.
The Belarusian Ministry of Foreign Affairs emphasizes that Belarus, when organizing the interaction between the EU and the CIS on its soil, does not pursue profitable goals, and the ultimate goal of such a format is the creation in the future of a single economic space from Lisbon to Vladivostok.
“This is absolutely in the spirit of those concepts that in other spheres, in particular in the field of security, the leadership of our strategic ally – the Russian Federation – put forward and promotes,” said Ogonku at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Belarus, a ministry where the words have been scrupulously picked up lately.
In Moscow, there may be paid entrance zones.
The government of Moscow is considering the option of introducing pay-for-entry zones as a method of combating the congestion of central roads by analogy with other major cities in the world, reports M24.ru with reference to the Deputy Mayor of Moscow for Transport Maxim Liksutov.
One option that has successfully established itself is paid entry.
This is an expert opinion, we will definitely study it, look at all the pros and cons.
It is too early to say that some decisions have been made on this matter,” Lyksutov said.
Zamera stressed that for the authorities of the capital, the experience of Asian cities is very important, which are similar in structure and congestion to Moscow.
One of the decisions taken from these countries is the construction of the central ring highway already being implemented, added Lyksutov.
The recent construction of the Central Ring Road is an example of the fact that it is not necessary to allow all traffic through Moscow.
If there was sufficient infrastructure for the circumference, then there was no need to have transit traffic in Moscow,” said the deputy mayor.
Maxim Lyksutov also said that the introduction of paid parking has significantly unloaded the capital streets.
And, according to him, the capital authorities do not plan to stop at what has been achieved.
On August 26, the mayor of the Russian capital Sergey Sobyanin took part in the ceremony of the construction of the first launch complex of the Moscow Central Ring Road (CCAD).
Grief is boring.
Frank Miller and Robert Rodriguez's film "City of Sins 2: A Woman Worth Killing" made the revolution you could expect from him.
The first "City of Sins" (2005), shot with minimal, but symbolic, participation of Quentin Tarantino, revolutionized the relationship between cinema, comics and literary noir.
The sequel is also revolutionary in its own way: in the sense that it destroys the fundamental chain for modern thinking "thesis - antithesis - synthesis" (if understood by the thesis the universe of Noara, and under antithesis - the cosmos of comics).
From now on it should be read: “thesis – antithesis – chaos.”
"City of Sins-2" is chaotic both on a dramatic and philosophical level: both times it is chaotic in the bad sense of the word.
Yes, some of the heroes are familiar with the first "City", although, behold, Marv (Mickey Rourke), remembers, ended his life on an electric chair, and here, nothing, only and has time to catch - in the role of a popular friend - from the air knives and other tails with darts.
But the elderly are literally shaken with their elbows by newcomers, as if they have broken into the city from some other film, about the meaning and plot of which the audience is asked not to worry.
So, its story, shamelessly broken by the authors in the most interesting place, has the super lucky player Johnny (Joseph Gordon-Levitt).
His - with the lustfully-frigid Eve Lord (Eva Green) and for something avenging her Dwight (Josh Brolin).
But this confusion, in which Dwight, say, cannot be distinguished in the face from Johnny - especially since the faces, like other parts of the body, the characters are treated with relentless regularity - is not trouble and not even half trouble.
These are not people, we understand that they are the archetypes of Noah: a fateful dog, a too self-confident player, a detective who has fallen into the "honey trap" of sex, a corrupt senator.
Well, when the archetype walks with the archetype and the archetype pursues, it is no longer a movie, but abstract painting.
And asking abstract painting questions about the logic of the story is just funny.
Even in this messy world, there is something permanent.
The fighting prostitutes from the first “City” still hold a circular defense against the siege of the dark forces.
Yes, and the ghost of Detective Hartigan is not-no, and will look at the lighthouse, and Bruce Willis is always nice to see.
The main problem of "City of Sins-2" lies in another.
Frank Miller was good at the fact that as a cartoonist he talentedly combined comics and noir, and as a director he reversed the idea of how to bring comics to the screen.
Comics and Noar are two aggressively opposed “realities.”
The phenomenon of the comic book in its modern form was born in the late 1920s, when Dahila Hammet’s novels “Bloody Harvest” (1929), “Maltese Sock” (1930) and “Glass Key” (1931) created the canon of Noara, then called hard-boiled school – “cool school”.
Or pulp fiction.
Comics gave Hollywood many dozens of heroes: from the seafarer Popay - the spinach-eater, giving him the power of the rich, Superman, Batman and detective Dick Tracy to Hulk, Thor, Spider-Man and other "vengers".
But in any movie on the motive of comics there was something detrimental: the drawn characters persistently did not want to grow up with the screen flesh, remained pretensions in the "real" world surrounding them by will and will.
Simply put, they were completely deprived of “existence.”
Noar, on the contrary, is the most existential genre of world literature.
After the World Wars, the traditional novel – with experiences, characters, family scandals and historical background – lost all credibility.
What Forssites, what Tibo and Rugon-Maccaras, what even Bolcon and Rostov are generally conceivable after Verdun, Auschwitz and Hiroshima?
Such a novel peacefully muted into the format of a soap opera, and the criminal - that is, by definition marginal - the novel rose to the level of philosophical prose.
Hammet learned on his skin what it was like to work as a sanitary on the front.
He was a Communist.
As, by the way, there were, at least close to the Communist Party and such pillars of the genre, such as writers Horas McCoy and Jim Thompson, directors Jules Dussin, Joseph Lowry, Edward Dmitry.
Therefore, the Noar, the archetype of which they set, is, firstly, rude and cynical, and, secondly, purely social.
This is hardly an American version of social realism.
The first "City of Sins" was remarkable precisely because it unnaturally but organically combined the comic book with Noar.
For the first time on the screen, the comic book came to life, not being embarrassed by its graphic nature, and not pretending to be a "real" film.
The darkness of the sales world, where the cardinal ordered murders and the senator covered the monstrous sadistic son, was quite worthy of Hammet’s pen.
And picturesque details like the cut-off heads with which the sadist decorated his nest, the pen of the brilliant James Ellroy, the author of "Black Orchid" and the best - that is, declaratively nauseous - representative of the neonour.
"City of Sins-2" is not even a retreat, but a surrender of Miller-Rodriges' radical style to the comic tradition.
Most of this is due to 3D technology.
When you watch the second "City of Sins", you feel trapped in a glass ball, inside which the snow fills a toy cloak.
However, most often it’s not snow, but bloodshed, but what’s the difference?
Well, about sociality and nothing to say.
After all, it is only possible when somewhere, somewhere we sometimes, even on the sidelines of dirty swamp, but there is a normal world where you can return the girl who went on the curved path or, say, tell the reluctant parents that her destroyer is punished.
When there is no place for anything but sin in the city of sin, then sin is no longer a sin, but a norm.
It’s boring like any norm.
The chaos of “City of Sins-2” is just boring.
For the sake of justice, the domestic rental gave this fresh sin a small but pepper.
Titles warn: the film contains harmful scenes of smoking.
In relation to the spectacle, in the most vegetarian episode of which a person's fingers are broken, it gives hellish humor.
Hamlet would like it.
France’s socialists should “stop and put France in order,” says key ally Francois Hollande
Mr. Vall called on the deeply divided left forces to “show a warm attitude” to the attacked socialist president, whose change did not find the approval of the overwhelming majority of French people.
The President deserves everyone’s respect, he deserves our loyalty, he deserves our support.
“It’s our duty to stay next to him,” he said with applause.
As a gesture of reconciliation, the prime minister assured that his government would not question the controversial 35-hour working week in France, despite inciting conflict proposals, it should weaken the rules made by Emmanuel Macron, the new economy minister, earlier this week.
On Saturday, Mr. Hollande begged his Socialist party comrades to remain “united” with the government.
However, Justice Minister Christian Tobira put the sticks in the wheels by coming to a meeting of dissenting members of the Socialist Party parliament and criticizing the Socialist Party for allowing the French to “loss faith in the future.”
Marine Le Pen, the leader of the far-right National Front, has expressed contempt for the ongoing internal conflict among the Socialists, saying that she does not imagine that the new Wall government will last longer than a few months.
Francois Hollande is a naked king, but naked and Prince Manuel Vall, forced to assemble a new government when the former did not last in the summer.
"And the new one will not last either in autumn or winter," Le Pen told reporters.
She repeated her party’s call to dissolve parliament, saying she was confident that the party could easily win early elections and was ready to rule.
France's ruling party survived defeat in the March municipal elections, and the far-right National Front came first in the EU elections in May.
A Sunday Journal du Dimanche poll found that 76 percent of French people believe that the Socialist Party is at risk of breaking down into several competing factions by the end of Mr. Hollande’s presidential term in 2017.
Pascal Perrino, a political scientist at the University of Sciences Po, warned that the French would quickly lose patience if the new socialist government failed to repair the economy and record unemployment.
"He has little time, but public opinion needs to quickly feel that something is changing," he warned.
Otherwise, the situation could get worse.
The “Drug-Free City” is not in charge.
The Sverdlovsky Arbitration Court has left without consideration the lawsuit of the administrative directorate of the regional Ministry of State Property Management against the fund "City Without Drugs".
The agency intended to collect more than 7 million rubles from the organization as a fee for renting a building in the center of Yekaterinburg.
However, the plaintiff did not appear in court twice.
Today the arbitration court of the Sverdlovsk region left without consideration the lawsuit of the Executive Directorate of the Ministry of State Property Management of the region (MUGISO) against the foundation "City Without Drugs" (one of the founders - the mayor of Yekaterinburg Yevgeny Royzman).
Representatives of the regional authorities intended to collect from the organization 7.3 million rubles. as a fee for the rental of the building.
Today it became known that the plaintiff did not appear in court twice, due to which the decision was made to refuse to consider.
Representatives in the MUGISO Directorate could not explain the reason for the absence, the head of the legal department Maxim Titov did not respond to phone calls.
Representatives of the Foundation were also unable to contact.
Recall, we are talking about the mansion, which occupied the foundation in the center of the city on Belinsky Street, 19 on a free basis since 2011.
This decision was made by former governor Alexander Misharin.
In November 2012, the administrative directorate of the Ministry of State Property Management of the Sverdlovsk region filed a lawsuit with the Sverdlovsk Arbitration Court on the removal of the fund from the building.
According to the lawsuit, the department demanded through the court to recognize the agreement of free use of the mansion-monument premises as not concluded.
According to the MUGISO Directorate, the agreement did not contain substantial conditions for the lease of a cultural heritage object.
The Sverdlovsky Arbitration Court rejected the claim, then an appeal was filed with the 17th Arbitration Court of Perm, which was satisfied.
Then to this same court the foundation filed a cassation complaint on this decision, which remained unsatisfied, after which the decision was appealed by the foundation in the Supreme Arbitration Court, but the court took the side of the directorate.
In 2013, a new lease agreement was concluded, according to which the fund again began to pay the rent, this was told by the head of the city Yevgeny Roizman.
The rent was assigned 300 thousand rubles per month.
The previous administration of the region gave us this building for free, acknowledging our merits in the fight against drugs, in respect of the foundation.
The current administration has decided differently,” he said.
Tatiana Drogaeva, Yekaterinburg
Why the mayor of Yekaterinburg offered to leave voluntarily
On July 24, the deputy of the pride of Yekaterinburg, Alexander Kosintsev, proposed to the mayor of the city, the speaker of the pride of Yekaterinburg, Evgeny Roysman, to resign.
The occasion was a criminal case against the arrested on suspicion of murder of a retired deputy of the Duma Oleg Kinev, considered an associate of the mayor.
Evgeny Roysman found a criminal case
On July 1, it became known about the initiation of a criminal case on the fact of "blasphemy" (Article 128.1 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation) on the blog of the mayor of Yekaterinburg Yevgeny Roysman.
This was to the Ministry of Internal Affairs in the Sverdlovsk region, where the general director of the legal center "Protection" Anna Filatova addressed with the corresponding statement.
According to her, Mr. Roisman accused her in her blog posts of being involved in crimes allegedly committed by her ex-husband.
The mayor of Yekaterinburg is convinced that "this is another attempt to avenge the truth."
iPhone becomes a wallet
On the eve of September 9, when Apple is due to present its new developments, new leaks appear in the press about what to expect from the presentation.
U.S. media reports that the sixth-generation iPhone will be equipped with a mobile wallet function as a result of a joint Apple project and payment systems Visa, MasterCard and American Express.
According to Bloomberg and the specialized Internet resource Re/code, at the presentation of new products on September 9, Apple may, among other things, announce a joint project with Visa, MasterCard and American Express, resulting in the new smartphone iPhone 6 will be available mobile wallet function.
The companies themselves declined to comment on this.
This feature allows you to make payment at the store’s cashier with the help of a smartphone.
Payment will be identified by the user by his fingerprint using Touch ID.
It is that the iPhone will be built into NFC (near field communication) technology for the first time, which allows to make contactless payments using the smartphone and the corresponding reader on the cash.
The NFC technology itself will be available thanks to a dedicated microprocessor from the Dutch high-tech company NXP (formerly Philips Semiconductors).
For the first time, NFC was introduced in 2004 as part of a collaboration between Sony, Nokia, Philips Semiconductors and more than a hundred other companies in the so-called NFC Forum - an association to promote this technology.
The first phone with NFC was released by Nokia in 2006.
The first smartphone on Android with NFC function – Samsung Nexus S – was introduced in 2010.
In May 2011, Google introduced the Google Wallet system, which allows users to link bank cards to their Google account and pay using their Android smartphone.
However, American experts emphasize that, despite the large investments of high-tech companies in the promotion of NFC technology, American retailers are still cautious about the innovation and are not too willing to spend money on equipping their stores with such systems.
Therefore, now the observers hope that Apple's entry into this market will still force retailers to accelerate and more actively implement this technology in their stores.
French Foreign Ministry: Paris's position on supplies to Russia of "Mistrals" does not change
The official spokesman of the French Foreign Ministry, Romane Nadal, said on the unchanged position of Paris regarding the supply of Russian helicopter carriers type "Mistral".
“I can recall the statement made by the President of the Republic (Francois Hollande) in an interview with the newspaper Le Monde on August 20: “Today, the level of sanctions does not hinder the supply.
This is the decision of the Europeans, not of France,” Nadal told RIA Novosti.
The representative of the French Foreign Ministry responded to the question whether the deterioration of the situation in Ukraine will not affect the change in Paris’s position on the implementation of this contract.

Hong Kong Democratic Movement Activists Disrupt Chinese Representative's Speech the Day After Election Decision
A group of citizens loyal to Beijing stood nearby, waving the Chinese flag.
The Permanent Committee of the National Assembly of People's Representatives of China on Sunday determined the procedure by which only two or three candidates will be allowed to participate in the 2017 Hong Kong elections.
All candidates must first get the support of the majority of the members of the nomination committee, which is likely to be filled with Beijing’s loyalists.
The decision made it almost impossible for the democratic opposition to enter the ballot box and forced activists of the democratic movement again to promise to stop Hong Kong’s financial center with Occupy Central protests.
Political reform is a major source of tension in Hong Kong, as Chinese party leaders fear that the call for democracy will spread to other cities.
Following Beijing’s publication of a document describing China’s control of Hong Kong in June, democratic activists held an informal referendum on elections in a special administrative region, and hundreds of thousands marched into the city’s business center and held a sitting strike.
The briefing is organized by the Hong Kong Government and the Chinese Contact Office in Hong Kong.
Vice-Chairman of the Standing Committee of the Chinese People's Assembly, Zhang Rongshun, and Deputy Director of the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Bureau of the State Council, Feng Wei, were also scheduled to speak at a series of briefings during the day.
Student activists said they would gather in front of the Hong Kong head of government building in the afternoon.
Britain did not mention democratic governance for Hong Kong until the last days of its 150 years of colonial rule.
Israel plans to annex 400 hectares of land belonging to the Palestinian Authority
The Israeli authorities have announced that they intend to annex 400 hectares of land on the West Bank of the Jordan River belonging to the Palestinian Authority.
The decision to annex the land of Southern Bethlehem is linked to the desire to pay back for the abduction and murder of three Israeli teenagers in June this year.
On the seizure of the territory, the Israeli Ministry of Defense said on Sunday and instructed the military to establish administrative control on the West Bank.
According to Gaza spokesman Saib Arikat, the world community should call on Israel to respond for “continuing settlement activity on the West Bank and in East Jerusalem.”
Putin urges Kiev to start negotiations on "statehood" of eastern Ukraine
According to Russian news reports on his remarks, Russian President Vladimir Putin demanded on Sunday that the Ukrainian government stop fighting separatists in the eastern part of the country and immediately start negotiations on the "statehood" of the separated region.
His spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, later clarified that Putin did not intend to hint that the separatist-controlled eastern Ukrainian territory would become part of Russia, but that its status within Ukraine needs to be revised to give the Russian-speaking region the opportunity to defend its rights and interests.
However, Putin’s call to the Kiev government to start negotiations with the pro-Russian rebels as equals was in line with the obvious strategy he has followed since the start of the bloodshed five months ago: to help the separatists seize territory and force the Ukrainian government to give the newly proclaimed territory of Novorossiya actual independence in order to get closer to Russia, not to the West.
In an interview with state television First Channel, Putin condemned the Ukrainian military campaign to return separatist-held territories in eastern Donetsk and Luhansk regions, which were seized in March and April after Moscow annexed the Ukrainian peninsula of Crimea on March 18.
The Kremlin and separatists recently called the territories captured by Novorossiya, or New Russia, the name that refers to the pre-revolutionary days of glory of the Russian Empire.
Putin said that anyone who believes that peace talks will take place in the near future, when Ukrainian politicians begin campaigns for parliamentary elections on October 26 and while government troops attack peaceful settlements in separatist-held regions, is a “prisoner of illusions,” ITAR-TASS.
“We must immediately start substantive negotiations and not only on technical issues, but also on the political structure of society and the state status of southeastern Ukraine, in order to respect the interests of the people living there,” he said.
Peskov said Putin’s words about statehood were meant in the context of wider autonomy, which has been discussed for months with leaders in Kiev in an attempt to soothe fears in Russian-speaking regions that their cultural and linguistic rights are at risk.
Only the Ukrainian government can give the eastern regions the necessary autonomy, Peskov said.
This is not a matter for discussion between Ukraine and Russia, Peskov said, "because it is not a conflict between Russia and Ukraine, but an internal Ukrainian conflict."
The Kremlin spokesman’s intervention to correct Putin’s “wrong interpretation” of the words has highlighted the Russian leadership’s decision to deal with the separatist uprising in the east in a different way than the open seizure of Crimea, where the majority of its two million people are ethnic Russians.
Moscow would have to endure a much tougher battle to annex even the Donetsk and Luhansk regions of eastern Ukraine, as most of the 6.5 million inhabitants are not Russians, and polls before the conflict began showed widespread support for the desire to stay inside Ukraine.
The autonomy that Russian diplomats discussed in international forums would give regional governments in Ukraine the power to determine trade agreements and foreign policy, in essence, transferring to the Kremlin the actual control of the territory that would connect the main territory of Russia with Crimea.
The Black Sea peninsula, which was annexed five months ago, houses the main Russian military fleet, as well as commercial naval facilities and historic seaside resorts.
In the regions between the Russian Rostov region and Crimea there are also mines, factories and casting plants that produce the necessary equipment for the Russian army.
Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko proposed during his inauguration speech on June 7, that Ukrainian lawmakers after the new elections weigh amendments to the constitution, allowing separate regions to give greater control over their finances and the status of languages.
However, his view of autonomy seems to be very different from that of the Kremlin and the separatist rebels, whose arms and incitement are accused of Moscow.
Putin’s latest appeal to Kiev to negotiate with separatist leaders as equals followed new insurgency attacks last week after Russian troops and tanks entered eastern Ukraine from a previously peaceful region along the Sea of Azov.
Russia-backed separatists took control of the city of Novozovsk in an offensive that Ukrainian security officials say fears is the beginning of a campaign to seize strategic coastal territory up to the Crimea itself.
This entailed large-scale civil and military efforts to strengthen Mariupol, a steel port with 500,000 inhabitants, which lies between Novozovsk and the narrow passage to the Crimean peninsula.
Poroshenko on Saturday appealed to a meeting of EU leaders in Brussels to call for measures to prevent further Russian aggression against Ukraine, a former Soviet republic that has been independent for 23 years.
“We are approaching the point of no return,” Poroshenko warned.
Thousands of foreign troops and hundreds of foreign tanks are now in Ukraine.
The EU summit did not take certain measures; the leaders called for a draft of harsher sanctions against Russia, which would be adopted in case of any escalation of the Ukrainian crisis.
Ukrainian soldiers had to leave their positions in Ilovaisk after two columns of Russian armoured vehicles and 1,000 troops entered the Donetsk region last week to support troubled separatists, Colonel Andriy Lysenko, a spokesman for the Ukrainian National Security and Defense Council, told reporters in Kiev on Saturday.
The first of the 63 Ukrainian soldiers, who arely detained in Ilovaisk as a result of the Russian invasion, were exchanged on Sunday for 10 Russian airmen captured on Ukrainian territory a week ago, Lysenko said on Sunday.
Scandal with naked photos captures Australian celebrities and Gabi Greco
Jeffrey Edelstein has expressed his disgust for hackers who may have stolen the naked photos of his bride Gaby Greco and a whole list of Hollywood stars.
Hollywood is upset after a series of frank photos depicting naked Jennifer Lawrence hit the internet as a result of a large-scale hacker scandal with celebrities.
It is said that the hacker responsible for this has about 60 frank photographs of "Hunger Games" star Lawrence and superstars, including models Kate Apton and Kara Delevingne, singers Rihanna, Ariana Grande and Leia Michelle and actress Kirsten Dunst.
The Australian actors Theresa Palmer, Emily Browning, Iwon Strakhovsky and Melbourne-based Greco were also allegedly stolen photos as a result of a leak from iCloud.
In the list of 101 names of celebrities.
Edelsten, who made Greco’s offer last month, said Confidential: “It’s disgusting.”
All private correspondence and photos must remain private.
It is terrible that personal information can be stolen and passed on to others.
Greco, who is in New York,ly told the news website that the hacking attack was “shameful” and that those it was targeted “feel invaded.”
The hacker is believed to have 30 photos of Palmer with her ex-boyfriend Scott Spidman, including two footage where she lies at the swimming pool with her naked breasts.
Palmer's work in the film includes "Love and Honor" along with Liam Hemsworth.
Palmer, star of the movie "Chak" Strahovsky and actress from the "Prohibited Reception" Browning yesterday did not comment on the stolen photos.
A Lawrence spokesman told TMZ: “It’s a brutal invasion of privacy.”
Actor Seth Rogen expressed his outrage at the hacker, tweeting: "Publishing photos stolen from a mobile phone is actually no different from selling stolen goods."
Just from a legal point of view, it is impossible to tolerate the publication of stolen photographs.
A potential way to steal photos of naked celebrities
The massive hacking of stars’ accounts may have been caused by a vulnerability in the Find My Phone app.
The potential scenario has been described by The Next Web.
On Github was published a script in Python language, which allowed to pick up passwords for the service Find My Phone of Apple.
This service allows you to track the location of the iPhone.
To access it, the same band of Apple ID login and password is used as to access the Apple iCloud cloud, from which photos of celebrities were stolen.
The script allowed the method of clicking to recognize the password from Find My Phone.
This method consistently enters all sorts of combinations of characters, starting with the most commonly used passwords.
The author of the script claimed that in the service Find My Phone the number of password options entered is unlimited.
With the correct organization of the security system after several unsuccessful attempts to enter the wrong password, the account should be blocked and inform the user about the attempt to hack.
Due to the vulnerability, users did not receive any messages about trying to pick up a password for their account.
Hackers discovered the password from the Apple ID and used it to access iCloud.
According to a Twitter message from a Hackapp user, the vulnerability was discovered two days ago, on Saturday, and it was accompanied by a password-picking script.
At the moment, the vulnerability is closed: after five attempts access to the service is blocked.
The resource contacted the user of Hackapp and he noted that the above-mentioned vulnerability is typical for many services, but noted that there is no evidence that this vulnerability was used to access the account "stars".
This is not me, plz RT
Prime Minister’s Twitter appeared once again
Although there is no solid evidence that a vulnerability in Find My Phone was used to steal photos, there has been a wave of malicious activity using this service before.
Hackers seized control of the device and demanded a ransom from the owners.
In that case, Apple told the media that the security of the cloud was not compromised in this case, but did not investigate how users lost their accounts.
Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev’s Twitter was also hacked.
If the hackers gained access to iCloud in the way described above, there could be a password for the head of government’s account in the microblogging service.
The Next Web failed to get Apple comments about the vulnerability in Find My Phone.
Putin granted Russian citizenship to Ukrainian female
Russian President Vladimir Putin granted Russian citizenship to the famous Ukrainian athlete Anna Buryak.
The corresponding decree has been published on the Internet portal of legal information.
At the beginning of this year, the athlete moved to Russia for a permanent place of residence and appealed to the Federation of modern five-fighting with a request to give her the opportunity to play for the Russian national team.
In 2013, she won two stages of the World Cup, won the silver medal of the European Championship in personal championship and became the world champion in mixed squad, which is one of the new types of program in this sport.
It holds a leading position this season as well.
According to the rules, in order to perform at the 2016 Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, she will need to obtain a special permission from the Olympic Committee of Ukraine.
Anna Buryak is not the first Ukrainian athlete to change citizenship.
In July, Vladimir Putin decided to issue a Russian passport to chess player Ekaterina Lagno - a native of Lviv, who is a two-time European champion (2005, 2008), world blitz (2010) and fast chess (2014).
As part of the women’s team of Ukraine, she won the Chess Olympiad in Turin (2006), the Team World Championship in Astana (2013) and the Team Championship of Europe in Warsaw (2013).
SCR stopped the investigation of the Tu-204 disaster in Vnukovo
The Investigative Committee of Russia (СКР) has terminated the criminal case on the fact of the crash of the aircraft Tu-204 of the airline Red Wings.
This is by the press service of the Ministry.
The decision was made in connection with the death of the commander of the aircraft and the boarding engineer.
Judicial examination showed that the cause of the disaster was increased speed of landing, failure of the crew to perform the standard procedures at landing, as well as the unintentional output of engines on increased rotations of direct traction.
The Tu-204 of the airline Red Wings, following the Prague-Moscow flight, crashed on December 29, 2012 when landing at Moscow's Vnukovo airport.
The aircraft crossed the runway and burned.
At the scene of the accident, the aircraft commander, the second pilot and the boarding engineer were killed.
Two passengers were transported to medical facilities, where they subsequently died from their injuries.
Three other passengers, hospitalized with severe bodily injuries, were undergoing long-term treatment.
In addition, the driver of the car, which was moving at the time of the disaster on the Kyiv highway, received serious bodily injuries.
There were no passengers on board the aircraft.
After the crash, the transport prosecutor's office conducted a check at Red Wings, during which numerous violations were detected.
In February 2013, the airline’s license was suspended.
The company resumed operations in the summer of 2013.
Alexander Yemelianenko began training in SIZO
The famous Russian mixed-style fighter, 33-year-old Alexander Yemelianenko, who is in SIZO on charges of violent acts of sexual nature against a housewife, fully recovered from injuries and began training.
This is by the “Championship”.
In May this year, the Investigative Committee of Russia charged Alexander Yemelianenko with rape.
The suspect was declared in search, on 9 May he was detained in Tambov after committing a road accident, as a result of which he received a fracture of the hip.
Emelyanenko Jr. was placed under arrest until August 31, the sentence was appointed for September 1.
However, the court was postponed, and the investigation insisted on extending the term of detention until September 30.
If the guilt of the athlete is proven, he risks imprisonment for up to six years.
What is the power, brother?
"Lenta.ru" recalls the most scandalous stories in the career of Alexander Yemelianenko

Anger is the most universal and functional human emotion.
Angry facial expression is biologically universal for humanity, and every organ and muscle group involved in its creation is not accidental, but is an additional means of expression of power and threat, Australian and US scientists have found out.
They about their findings in the journal Evolution and Human Behavior, and they can be read briefly in the press release of the University of California in Santa Barbara.
The angry expression of the face - the sloped and lowered eyebrows, the stretched lips in a thin line, the swollen nostrils - is the same in all cultures, and is made even by birth blind children who have never seen it, notes lead author of the study Aaron Sell.
As part of a large research project dedicated to the nature of anger, scientists found that this emotion arose to effectively lead disputes during conflict.
The more physical harm one person can inflict on another, the more ability he has to dictate his conditions, and he communicates this to the interlocutor with the help of anger.
The researchers found confirmation for another hypothesis: physically strong people are more likely to get angry and move to handicraft, consider themselves entitled to impose unfavourable conditions on others, and also prefer the force methods of conflict resolution to peaceful ones.
Based on the fact that anger is primarily a “trade emotion”, the scientists decided that the movements of each of the seven muscle groups that create the angry expression of the face should represent the angry individual more powerful and dangerous in the eyes of the interlocutor – and thus force as soon as possible to agree with his conditions in order to avoid conflict.
To verify this hypothesis, the researchers modeled the face on the computer, where each of the seven elements of the angry face was present or absent, and showed them to informants.
Although the lowered eyebrows or forwarded beard separately did not make the face angry, the physically stronger person depicted with such traits was unanimously admitted by the study participants.
Human anger, as in animals, expresses a threat: an exaggerated manifestation of one’s own strength, forcing one to agree and obey.
A person blows up the nostrils and presses his lips for the same purpose as a frog that blows up, or a babouin that demonstrates his kicks.
Anger is triggered by the refusal of the interlocutor to accept the situation, and the person immediately takes the form, most effectively demonstrating to the opposite side the consequences of this refusal.
But the most striking thing is that none of the components of the angry face is arbitrary, they all express the same thing," said anthropologist John Tubi.
