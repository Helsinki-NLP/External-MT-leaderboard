Not only does this confirm that some dinosaurs had feathers, as that theory was already popular, but it also sheds light on details that fossils are not usually able to reveal - such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists say that the animal's feathers were chestnut brown above and light or orange-yellow on the sides.
The discovery may also provide insight into the evolution of bird feathers.
Since dinosaurs did not have a well-developed tongue, called a wing, but had other features of a feather - feather fibers and feathers - the researchers concluded that the feathers were likely a result of later evolutionary development.
The structure of the feather suggests that it was used not for flight but for temperature control or for highlighting, and the researchers found that although this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the pattern refers to an adult feather, not a litter feather.
The researchers suggested that although this is a young dinosaur's tail, the pattern suggests an adult feather, not a litter feather.

In France, the election traditionally takes place with little technology: voters lock themselves in a booth and put a pre-printed sheet of paper indicating the chosen candidate in an envelope.
After the officials verify the identity of the voter, the voter throws the envelope into the ballot box and signs the voter list.

Since 1988, polling stations have had to be transparent so that voters and observers can see that there is no envelope in them before the vote and that only duly registered and eligible voters can put an envelope in them.
Candidates can send representatives to monitor all steps of the process, and votes are counted at night by volunteers under strict supervision, following well-defined procedures.

This is common practice in other parts of the UK, but the Scottish judiciary works differently, and the courts consider the publication of photographs to be potentially prejudicial.
Pamela Ferguson, a professor at the University of Dundee, says that journalists are on a dangerous path when they publish photos or similar of suspects.
The Crown Prosecution Service has told reporters that they will not discuss the case again until the indictment.
According to the leaked information, the document concerns the territorial claim that Palestine seeks on the basis of the pre-1967 Middle East war borders.
Other subjects reportedly involved included the future status of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both nations, and the problem of the Jordan Valley.
Israel demands a continuous military presence in the valley for 10 years after the signing of the treaty, while the PH is only willing to accept such a presence for five years.
The snipers in the supplemental pesticide trial were kept under strict control by the rangers as the trial was observed and its effectiveness evaluated.
The NPWS and the Australian Shooting Association (NSW) have jointly recruited trained volunteers under the Shooting Association's hunting programme.
Mick O'Flynn, executive director of the NPWS Parks and Heritage Office, said the four shooters selected for the first launch operation have received comprehensive safety and practical training.
Martelly was sworn in yesterday before a new nine-member provisional electoral council.
This is Martelly's fifth CEP in four years.
Last month, a presidential committee recommended the resignation of the previous CEP as part of a package of measures to lead the country to new elections.
The committee was Martelly's response to the massive anti-regime protests that began in October.
Violent protests in some places were triggered by the failure of elections, some of which had been due since 2011.
They reported about 60 cases of malfunctioning iPods overheating, causing a total of six fires and injuring four people with minor burns.
The Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said that 27 were aware of the accident involving the equipment.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had notified it of 34 additional cases of obesity, which the company described as "not serious".
"The Department's response was to call the delay in Apple's announcement "sincerely regrettable".
The earthquake struck the Mariana Islands at 7:19 a.m. local time (Friday, 7:19 p.m. Greenwich Mean Time).
The Northern Mariana Islands Disaster Management Authority says there was no damage reported in the country.
The Pacific Tsunami Monitoring Center also reported no signs of a tsunami.
A former Filipino police officer hijacked a bus and captured Hong Kong tourists in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 at the tourists.
Several hostages were rescued, but at least six others were confirmed dead.
Six hostages, including children and elderly, were released earlier, as were the Filipino photographers.
The photographers later took over for an elderly lady who had to go to the bathroom, and Mendoza was shot.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and became a doctor.
She trained as a midwife and began working at the Auckland National Women's Hospital in 1959.
Liggins, while working at the hospital, took his free time to study premature birth.
Her research has shown that administering a hormone can speed up the development of the fetal lung.
Xinhua reported that government investigators found two black boxes on Wednesday.
The other wrestlers also paid homage to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said, "Luna was the first queen of extremity, my first manager, and she died two months ago, and she was very unique, just like you, a strong woman".
"Dustin Goldust Runnels noted that Luna was as weird as I was... maybe even more so... I love her and will miss her... I hope she's in a better place now".
In the run-up to the 2010 federal election, the proportion of 1,400 people who voted against Australia becoming a republic increased by 8% since 2008.
Acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard during the 2010 federal election campaign claimed that at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign, Australia should become a republic.
34 percent of the voters agree that Queen Elizabeth II should be the last Australian monarch.
According to the poll's extreme values, 29% of respondents think Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31% think Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist would have competed in the 100 and 200 meters and three relay events at the Commonwealth Games, but her complaints raised doubts about her fitness.
He couldn't get the medication he needed to beat the pain because he was banned from the games.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, on January 25 discovered the largest prime number ever known.
Several people verified the discovery in early February using various hardware and software, which was later reported on Tuesday.
It's possible that comets were the largest carriers of water to Earth, along with the organic matter that makes up proteins and supports life.
Scientists hope to understand the formation of the planets, especially the formation of the Earth, after comets struck the Earth long ago.
Cuomo, 53, took office earlier this year and signed a bill to legalize same-sex marriage.
He called the rumors "political gossip and stupidity".
Some say he's running for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that the FAA says would allow planes to fly shorter distances, saving millions of gallons of fuel each year and reducing carbon emissions.
It uses satellite technology as opposed to older ground-based radar technology to enable air traffic controllers to determine the position of aircraft more accurately and to provide pilots with more accurate information.
There will be no extra transport, no overland trains will stop at Wembley, and parking and P+R parking will be unavailable.
Fears about the lack of supplies raised the possibility of the game being played behind closed doors without the team's fans.
A study published Thursday in the journal Science reports the emergence of a new bird species in the Galapagos Islands of Ecuador.
Researchers at Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden reported the emergence of a new species, formed by crossing the native medium-sized earthworm (Geospiza fortis) with a new species, the large cactus (Geospiza conirostris), and although this process was thought to take much longer, the new species evolved in just two generations.
Gold can be shaped into any shape, even in small pieces.
It is flexible, easy to twist and pull into a wire that can be drawn, and it can be forged or rolled into plates.
It can be very thin and stick to other metals, so thin that it is sometimes used to decorate hand-painted images of illuminated manuscripts.
This is called chemical pH, and you can make an indicator out of the red onion soup.
The color of the cabbage soup varies depending on how acidic or alkaline the chemical is.
The pH level is determined by the number of hydrogen ions (H in pH) of the test chemical.
Hydrogens are protons formed by electron donation (since the hydrogen atom consists of one proton and one electron).
Mix the two dry powders together and then press them into a ball with your clean, wet hand.
The moisture on your hands reacts with the outer layers, which gives you a strange feeling and forms a kind of crust.
In the cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro, nearly every house had a flush toilet connected to a sophisticated sewage system.
Remains of canal systems have been found in houses in the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini, Greece.
In ancient Egypt, Persia, and China, toilets were sometimes part of public baths, where men and women were in mixed company.
When you call someone thousands of miles away, you use satellite.
The satellite in space will pick up the transmission and send it back to Earth almost immediately.
The satellite was launched by a rocket, and scientists use astronomical telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts some of the light and visibility.
It takes a giant rocket over 100 feet to launch a satellite or telescope into space.
The wheel has made incredible changes in the world, and the greatest thing we have done is to make transportation much easier and faster.
It brought us the train, the car and many other means of transportation.
Below them are medium-sized cats, which eat medium-sized prey from rabbits to antelopes to deer.
Finally, many small cats (including domestic cats) eat far more small prey, such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret to their success is the concept of niche, a special activity that every cat does, preventing it from competing with others.
Lions are the most social of all cats, and they live in large groups called herds.
The herds consist of one to three related males and up to 30 females and cubs.
Females are usually more bonded with each other, being a large family of sisters and daughters.
Lion wolves are surprisingly similar to wolf or dog wolves, animals that are similar in behavior to lions (but not to other big cats), and are also very lethal to their prey.
A balanced athlete, the tiger can climb trees (though not very well), swim, jump long distances, and pull with five times the strength of a strong man.
The tiger (Genus Panthera) is a member of the lion, leopard, and jaguar group, and is the only member of the four great cats that can howle.
The roar of a tiger is not like the full-blown roar of a lion, but rather like a phrase made up of a few words uttered in a whirl.
The ocelots are happy to eat small animals, and if they can, they can also catch monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds, and almost all the animals that the ocelots hunt are much smaller than themselves.
Scientists believe that the ocelots follow the scent of animals (prey) and sniff the ground to find them.
They are very good at seeing in the dark, because they have night vision and are very sneaky, and they hunt their prey by blending into the environment and then attacking their prey.
When a small group of organisms (a small population) is separated from the main population from which it originated (for example, if it crosses a mountain or a river, or if it crosses a new island and cannot easily return), it often finds itself in a different environment from the one it came from.
This new environment has different resources and different competitors, so the new population must have different characteristics or adapt to be a stronger competitor than it needed before.
The original population hasn't changed, they still need the same adaptations.
Over time, as the new population adapts to the new environment, it will become less and less like the other population.
Eventually, over thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will be so different that they cannot even be called the same species.
This process is called species formation, which means the formation of new species, and species formation is an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants are capable of producing oxygen, which humans breathe in, and of absorbing carbon dioxide, which humans exhale.
Plants get their food from the sun by photosynthesis, and they also provide shade.
We build our houses out of plants, we make our clothes out of plants, we make most of the food we eat out of plants, and without plants, animals wouldn't exist.
The mosasaur was the top predator of its time, so it wasn't afraid of anything except another mosasaur.
More than 70 razor blades protrude from its long jaws, and a row of them are found on its palate, so nothing escapes in its path.
We don't know for sure, but it could have been a fox tongue, feeding on turtles, big fish, other mosasaurs, maybe even a cannibal.
At the same time, it attacked anything that got into the water, not even a giant dinosaur like T. rex.
Although most of their food would be familiar to us, the Romans had their own strange or unusual festive dishes, including boar, peacock, snails, and a rodent called peanut shell.
The other difference was that while poor men and women ate their food sitting on chairs, rich men liked to have a feast together, where they would sit and chat side by side.
Ancient Roman food could not include foods that came to Europe from the Americas or Asia in later centuries.
For example, they had no corn, no tomatoes, no potatoes, no cocoa, and the ancient Romans never tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built a temple for all their gods, which they considered to be the home of the god.
People sacrificed to their gods and priests and tried to satisfy the gods' needs by means of rituals and festivals.
Each church had an open courtyard and an inner sanctuary that was open only to priests.
Sometimes special pyramid-shaped towers called zikkuras were built as part of the temples.
The top of the tower served as a special sanctuary for the deity.
The warm climate of the Middle East made the house unimportant.
The Hebrew family lived much of their life outdoors.
Women cooked in the courtyard, shops were open counters overlooking the street, houses were built of stone.
The land of Canaan was not heavily forested, so wood was an extremely valuable commodity.
The Norse say that Erik the Red was banished from Iceland for murder, and when he traveled further west, he found Greenland and named it Greenland.
But regardless of his discovery, the Eskimo tribes were already living there.
Although each country was Scandinavian, the people, kings, customs, and histories of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland differed in many ways.
If you've seen the movie The Golden Mother of the Nation, you might think that there's a treasure map inscribed on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
Although there's something written on the back of the document, it's not a treasure map.
"The back of the Declaration of Independence bears the words "The original Declaration of Independence dated July 4, 1776".
Although the identity of its author is uncertain, it is known that shortly after its completion the large parchment document (29 and a quarter inches long and 24 and a half inches wide) was kept in a roll.
So it's likely that the mark was simply added as a label.
The Normandy landings and the ensuing battles liberated the north of France, but the south remained unfree.
This was ruled by the French, the Vichy, who were French people who in 1940 made peace with the Germans and worked with the invaders instead of fighting them.
"On August 15, 1940, the Allies invaded southern France, the invasion was called Operation Dragoon".
In less than two weeks, American and Free French forces liberated southern France and turned toward Germany.
Civilization is the unique culture that is shared within a larger group of people who live and work together in a society.
The word civilization is derived from the Latin words civilis, civis, and civitas, which mean citizen, citizen, or city or city-state, the latter of which to some extent determines the size of society.
Civilized culture involves the transmission of knowledge over several generations, a lasting cultural footprint and fair distribution.
Smaller cultures often disappear without leaving any relevant historical evidence, and therefore cannot be recognized as true civilizations.
During the War of Independence, the 13 states first established a weak central government - with Congress as the sole constituent element - under the Articles of Confederation.
Congress had no power to impose taxes, and there was no national executive or judicial body, so it often relied on reluctant state authorities to enforce its laws.
Nor did it have the authority to override tax laws and interstate tariffs.
The amendment of the Basic Law required the unanimous consent of all the states, but the states did not take the central government so seriously that their representatives often stayed away from the meetings.
The Italian national football team is the second most successful team in the world after the German national football team, and won the 2006 FIFA World Cup.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, wrestling, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller skating and Formula 1.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern regions, with Italians competing in international games and Olympic events.
Japan is made up of nearly 7,000 islands (the largest of which is Honshu), making Japan the seventh-largest island in the world!
"Given the density/grouping of islands, Japan is often referred to geographically as an ""island group"".
Taiwan's history dates back to the 15th century, when passing European sailors recorded the island's name - Ilha Formosa - meaning Beautiful Island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan, reformed the native grain-growing methods, and employed Chinese laborers in rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) forces took control of western Taiwan and the northern coastal areas and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after the defeat of the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, giving sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu is divided into three main parts, the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Temple of the Three Wings.
Most of the buildings on the edges of the complex have been rebuilt to give tourists a better view of their original appearance.
By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and restoration work continues today.
For example, the most common still image format in the world is 35 mm, which was the defining film size at the end of the age of analogue film.
It's still in production today, but what's important is that it's been scaled up to the image-sensing format of a digital camera.
The 35 mm format actually means, somewhat confusingly, 36 m wide and 24 mm high.
The aspect ratio of this format (to obtain the simplest integer ratio after division by 12) can now be set to 3:2.
Many common formats (such as the APS format family) are equivalent to or approaching this image size ratio.
The rule of thirds, often misused and often ridiculed, is a simple directive that creates dynamism while maintaining a measure of order in an image.
It states that the most effective place for the main subject is the carving of lines that divide the image into vertical and horizontal thirds (see example).
During this period of European history, the rich and powerful Catholic Church was under attack.
For over a thousand years, Christianity united the states of Europe, despite differences in language and customs.
His far-reaching power affected everyone from the king to the common man.
One of the main Christian teachings is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that the church's funds should specifically serve this purpose.
The central authority of the church had been in Rome for over a thousand years, and this concentration of power and money raised questions among many as to whether its basic teaching would be fulfilled.
Shortly after the outbreak of hostilities, Britain initiated a naval blockade of Germany.
The strategy has proved effective in blocking vital military and civilian supplies, although the blockade violated general international law as enshrined in several international agreements of the previous two centuries.
Britain mined international waters to prevent any ships from entering entire ocean areas, endangering even neutral ships.
Since the response to this tactic was limited, Germany expected a similar response to the unrestricted submarine warfare.
During the 1920's, the dominant form of behavior of citizens and nations was pacifism and isolationism.
Having experienced the horrors and atrocities of war through World War I, nations will avoid similar situations in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to take a position in New York City at the Edison Company.
When he arrived in the United States, he had nothing but a book of poems and a letter of recommendation to Thomas Edison from Charles Batchelor (his old boss).
Ancient China had a distinctive way of representing different eras: each era and each ruling family in Chinese history was a distinctive dynasty.
There was a period of uncertainty between the various dynasties, most notably the Three Kingdoms period, which lasted for 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During these periods, several nobles who fought for the throne fought fierce battles with each other.
The Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest periods in ancient Chinese history, where thousands died fighting for the highest seat in Xi'an Palace.
There are many social and political implications of the decimal system, a shift from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism and a belief in the country as a people and not as an independent sovereign.
After the revolution, jobs were opened up to all male applicants, allowing the most ambitious and successful to be overtaken.
The same is true of the military, for instead of the rank of the army being determined by class, it is now based on the attribute.
The French Revolution also inspired oppressed working-class members of many other countries to start their own revolution.
"Mohammed had a deep interest in things beyond the worldly life, and he regularly visited a cave on Mount Noor, which became known as the Hira, a place of meditation".
It is the very cave that has passed through time and gives a very vivid picture of Muhammad's spiritual inclinations.
The cave, located on top of a mountain north of Mecca, is completely isolated from the outside world.
What's more, even if you knew it existed, it's not easy to find it.
Nothing is visible but the clear, beautiful skies and surrounding mountains, a world hardly seen or heard from inside the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders of the World still standing today.
The Great Pyramid, built by the Egyptians in the third century B.C.E., is one of many large pyramids built to honor dead pharaohs.
"The Giza Plateau, or the ""Necropolis of Giza"" in Egypt's Valley of the Dead, is home to several pyramids (the Great Pyramid being the largest), as well as several small tombs, numerous temples, and the great Sphinx".
The great pyramid of Khufu, along with several smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples, were built to honor the wives and family members of Khufu.
The upward pull sign is V-shaped and the downward pull sign is a fire hook or a square without the bottom.
Up means you start at the mountain and pull the bow, down means you start at the frog (where you hold your hand on the bow) and pull the bow.
"A "up" pull usually produces a softer sound, while a "down" pull is stronger and more determined".
Feel free to mark your comments with a pencil, but remember that printed quotation marks are there for musical reasons, and they should generally be respected.
The terrified Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (Maria Theresa, aged 11, and Louis-Charles, aged 4), and the king's sister, Madame Elizabeth, were forced from Versailles to Paris by a mob of market tradeswomen on October 6, 1789.
They were driven back to Paris in a carriage, surrounded by a mob, shouting threats against the king and queen.
The crowd forced the king and queen to open the windows of their sleds completely.
Suddenly, in the presence of the frightened queen, a member of the crowd shook the head of a member of the royal guard who had been killed at Versailles.
The war expenses of US imperialism to conquer the Philippines were paid by the Filipino people themselves.
To cover much of the cost, they had to pay taxes to the American colonial government, and bonds poured into Wall Street banks on behalf of the Philippine government.
Of course, the super profits came from the prolonged exploitation of the people of the Philippines, which constituted the basic profits of American imperialism.
To understand the temples, we must understand the circumstances that led to the establishment of the order.
The period of events is generally referred to as the Late Middle Ages in European history, the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (AD 1000-1300).
The High Middle Ages were preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which conventionally ends around 1500.
Technological determinism in practice involves a wide range of ideas, the emphasis on technology or technological imperative strictly raises the sense that human destiny is governed by the underlying logic of scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.
"Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general ideas: that the development of technology itself largely follows a path beyond cultural or political influence, and that on the other hand technology has an ""impact"" on societies, and these impacts are concomitant rather than socially conditioned".
For example, there is a view that the motor vehicle necessarily leads to the improvement of roads.
However, the country-wide road network is not economically viable with few cars, so new production methods have been developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
At the same time, mass car ownership is leading to high rates of road accidents, which is spurring new techniques in health care to heal injured bodies.
Much of Romanticism was influenced by cultural determinism and was inspired by writers such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography shaped individuals, and over time, customs and culture associated with the geographic location evolved, which, in keeping with the location of the community, proved to be superior to arbitrary laws.
Just as Paris was known as the fashion capital of the world at the time, so Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its reputation as the epicenter of luxury began around 400 AD and lasted until around 1100 AD.
Its position deteriorated in the 12th century, primarily because the Crusaders rejected such dubious gifts as silk and spices, which were valued more highly than those offered by the Byzantine markets.
It was during this time that Paris won the title of fashion capital from Constantinople.
The Gothic style was at its peak from the 10th-11th century to the 14th century.
The dress was initially heavily influenced by Byzantine, Eastern culture.
However, because of the slow communication methods, styles may have been 25 to 30 years behind in the West.
By the late Middle Ages, Western Europe was beginning to develop its own style, and one of the biggest developments from the Crusades was that people began to attach their clothes with buttons.
Subsistence farming is farming that is only done to produce enough food to meet the needs of the farmer and his family.
Self-sustaining agriculture is a simple, often organic system that uses preserved seeds and a seed drill or other relatively simple techniques that are widespread in the ecoregion to maximize yield.
Throughout history, most farmers have been self-sufficient in their agriculture, and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together like-minded people who feel neglected by social norms and allow for the development of self-esteem within them.
Subcultures may be characterised by the age, ethnicity, social class, location and/or gender of the members.
The defining attributes of a subculture may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical differences or a combination of these factors.
Members of a subculture often indicate their membership by a recognizable symbolic style that includes fashion, behavioral patterns, and the use of slang.
One of the most common ways to demonstrate the importance of socialization is to draw attention to the example of some unfortunate children who, because of neglect, misfortune, or premeditated abuse, were not able to socialize with adults as they grew up.
Some wild children were isolated by humans (often their own parents) and sometimes the abandonment of the child was due to the child's severe intellectual or physical weakness.
The children who were left wild may have experienced severe abuse or trauma before they were abandoned or fled.
Others are said to have been raised among animals; some are said to have lived alone in the wild.
When raised entirely by nonhuman animals, a child in the wild, with physical limitations, will almost entirely adopt the behavior patterns of the animal caring for him, such as fear or indifference toward humans.
While project-based learning should make learning easier and more interesting, the scaffolding goes one step further.
Scaffolding is not a learning method, but rather a help that provides support for those who are engaged in a new learning experience, such as learning to use new software or embarking on a new project.
"The stands can be both virtual and real, in other words, the teacher is a kind of "stand", but also the little gimp in Microsoft Office".
Virtual stands have been integrated into the software to question, guide, question and explain the procedures that would have challenged the student to complete the task on their own.
Children are placed in orphanages for a variety of reasons, ranging from neglect to abuse to even blackmail.
A child should never be allowed to grow up without a nurturing, nurturing, nurturing environment, but it does happen.
We consider foster care to be a safe zone for these children.
Our foster care is about a safe home, loving caregivers, stable education, and a reliable health care system.
Orphanages must provide for all the needs that are missing from the former home from which they were removed earlier.
The Internet combines elements of mass communication and interpersonal communication.
The specific characteristics of the Internet lead to further possibilities in terms of the usage and satisfaction model.
For example, "learning" and "socialization" are suggested as important motivations for Internet use (James et al., 1995).
"Personal engagement" and "continuous relationships" were also considered as new motivational factors in the study by Eighmey and McCord (1998), which focused on the audience's reaction to Internet pages".
Using video footage has led to important discoveries in the interpretation of micro-facial expressions, facial movements that last for a few milliseconds.
Especially if they claim that some people can correctly tell when someone is lying by certain facial expressions.
In his essay on the presidential speech, Oliver Sacks pointed out that people with brain damage who cannot understand speech have a very accurate sense of honesty.
He also claims that the ability to interpret human behavior is found in animals, such as domestic dogs.
20th-century research has shown that there are two variations of genetic variation: hidden and expressed.
Mutation opens the door to new genetic variation, but selection removes it from the set of expressed variation.
A mixture of segregation and recombination, the back and forth between the two funds in every generation.
Outside of the savannah, mammals with digestive systems similar to humans have a hard time meeting their amino acid needs from available plant resources.
Moreover, failure to do so has serious consequences - growth depression, malnutrition, and eventually death.
The most readily available plant resources would have been proteins in leaves and stems, but these are difficult for primates like us to digest unless they are cooked.
In contrast, foods of animal origin (ants, termites, eggs) are not only easy to digest but also provide a high amount of protein, containing all the essential amino acids.
All things considered, it wouldn't be surprising if our ancestors solved the protein problem in the same way that chimpanzees do today on the savanna.
Interruption of sleep is the intentional awakening from a normal sleep cycle and falling back to sleep within a short period of time (10-60 minutes).
This can be done quite easily with a relatively quiet alarm clock to bring you to a state of alertness without waking you up completely.
If you are sleeping, set the clock to the other side of the room, forcing yourself to get out of bed and turn it off.
Another biorhythm-based option is to consume a lot of fluids (especially water, tea, which is a well-known diuretic) before sleep, forcing the person to urinate at night.
The degree of inner peace that a person possesses is in contrast to the degree of tension in the body and mind.
The lower the tension, the more positive the life force. Every human being has the opportunity to find perfect peace and contentment.
Enlightenment is available to anyone, and the only thing that can prevent us from reaching that goal is our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but has been expanded with the Mahayana way of love and many techniques of Indian yoga.
The principles of Tibetan Buddhism are very simple, it's Kundalini yoga, meditation and the path of all-embracing love.
Kundalini yoga is a technique that involves the awakening of the Kundalini energy (the energy of enlightenment) through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras and visualizations.
The focus of Tibetan meditation is the yoga of the deity, and by visualizing the various deities, the energy channels are cleared, the chakras are activated, and the consciousness is enlightened.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, which led to cooperation between the Soviet Union and the United States. At the end of the war, differences in systems, methods, and cultures resulted in the countries entering into conflict.
Two years after the war ended, the former allies became enemies, and the Cold War began.
Over the next 40 years, proxy armies were formed in Africa, Asia, Afghanistan, Cuba, and many other places.
On September 17, 1939, the Polish defences were broken, and the only hope was to retreat and reorganize through the Romanian bridgehead.
However, these plans were declared obsolete almost overnight when more than 800,000 soldiers from the Soviet Red Army entered and formed the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts after invading eastern Poland, in violation of the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Treaty and other international bilateral and multilateral agreements.
The use of cargo ships is by far the most efficient way to transport large numbers of people and large quantities of goods across the oceans.
The Navy's job has traditionally been to ensure that the country is able to move people and goods while preventing the enemy's ability to move people and goods.
One of the most memorable and recent examples of this was the North Atlantic campaign of World War II, where the Americans tried to cross the Atlantic with men and supplies to help the British.
At the same time, the German Navy tried to stop this traffic, primarily with submarines.
If the Allies had failed, Germany would probably have been able to conquer Britain as well as the rest of Europe.
It seems that goats were first domesticated in the Zagros Mountains of Iran about 10,000 years ago.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to keep them for their easily available milk, as well as for their fur, meat, and skin.
Domesticated goats were usually kept in herds that roamed hills or other pastures, often under the supervision of child or adolescent shepherds, similar to the more widely known shepherds.
The railway was built in England in the 16th century.
Although the tracks consisted of only parallel-laying poles, they allowed the horses to pull faster and heavier loads than on the relatively narrow, winding roads of the era.
The connecting elements were used quickly enough to keep the track in place, but they also realized that it would be more efficient to put a piece of iron on it.
This became a daily practice, but the iron made better use of the wooden wheels of the wagon.
Eventually, wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels, and in 1767 the first railways were built entirely of iron.
The first known mode of transport was walking, and humans began walking on two legs about two million years ago, around the time of the appearance of Homo Erectus.
Their ancestors, the Australopithecus, were not normally straight.
Two-legged species are found in the fossils of Australopithecus 4.2-3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus could have walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can start living more environmentally friendly, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even become activists to reduce the suffering of the future in some way.
It's like symptomatic treatment in many ways, but if we want to do more than just temporarily fix it, we need to find the root of the problem and get rid of it.
It is quite clear that the world has changed a lot because of mankind's scientific and technological advances, and the problems have become greater because of overpopulation and mankind's luxurious lifestyle.
After its July 4 introduction to Congress, a handwritten draft signed by the President of Congress, John Hancock, and Secretary of State, Charles Thomson, was sent to the John Dunlap printing house a few blocks away.
Between 150 and 200 copies were made overnight, now called "Dunlap prints".
The document was first read publicly by John Nixon in the courtyard of Independence Hall on July 8.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6, who read it to his troops in New York on July 9.
The 25 pages still numbered are the oldest surviving copies of the document.
Many paleontologists now believe that only one group of dinosaurs survived, and that's birds.
Many people don't think of them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and they can fly.
Birds still look a lot like dinosaurs.
They have pointy, clawed legs, lay eggs, and walk on two hind legs, like a T-Rex.
Virtually every computer in use today is based on the processing of information encoded in binary numbers.
A binary number can have only one of two values, 0 or 1, which are called binary digits or bits in computer language.
Internal toxicity is not necessarily immediately apparent, and symptoms such as vomiting are too common to be diagnosed immediately.
The most certain sign of internal poisoning may be an open container of medicinal or toxic household chemicals.
Check the label to see if it contains the first aid instructions for the poison.
The term "beetle" is used by entomologists in an official sense for this group of insects.
The term comes from the ancient knowledge of bedbugs, which are insects that are perfectly adapted to parasitize humans.
Both robber snails and bed snails are nesting, meaning they are suitable for nesting or for use by the host organization.
With some 400,000 cases of multiple sclerosis (MS) in the United States, it has become the leading neurological disease among younger and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which consists of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerves.
Research has shown that women are twice as likely to develop multiple sclerosis as men.
A couple may even decide that it is not in their or their child's best interest to raise a baby.
These couples may decide to make an adoption plan for their baby
At adoption, the blood-switched parents give up their parental rights to another couple to raise the child.
The main purpose of science is to find out by scientific methods how the world works, and this method is essentially the basis of most scientific research.
But it's not just that. Experimentation, and an experiment is a test that is used to rule out one or more possible hypotheses, to ask questions, and to observe, which also help in scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts, especially the Latin Bible.
Aristotle's views have been adopted in all fields of science, including psychology.
With the decline of Greek language, the West cut itself off from its philosophical and scientific roots.
Most of the rhythms that can be achieved in physiology and human behavior are, in most cases, highly dependent on the occurrence and production of endogenous cycles during the biological cycle.
In most living things, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals, we observe periodic rhythms that are not mere reactions to external periodic cues.
The biological clock is a self-sustaining oscillator that keeps cycles running freely even in the absence of external stimuli.
The Hershey-Chase experiment was one of the most important proofs of the theory that DNA is genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used bacteriophages or viruses to insert their own DNA into a bacterium.
Two experiments were performed in which the DNA of the phage was marked with radioactive phosphorus or the phage protein with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have different effects depending on the nature of the mutation, the significance of the genetic material and whether the cells involved are germ cells.
Only mutations in germline cells can be passed on to children, whereas mutations elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism attracts people who are interested in natural sites and enjoy the scenery, including flora and fauna.
The field programmes include hunting, fishing, photography, birding, park visits and the study of ecosystem information.
For example, visiting, photographing, and learning about the Bornean orangutans.
Every morning, people drive from small rural towns to their workplaces, passing by those whose workplaces are the same as the one they left.
In this dynamic mobile transport, everyone is connected to everyone else in some way and supports a transport system based on the use of private cars.
Science suggests that this massive carbon dioxide emissions has cut off the biosphere from the stable state that has supported human evolution for the past two million years.
Everyone is part of society and uses transportation systems.
In developed countries, such complaints about water quality or broken bridges are rare.
Why do transportation systems generate such complaints, why do they fail every day? Are transportation engineers simply incompetent? Or is there something fundamentally wrong?
Traffic flow is the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions between them.
Unfortunately, studying traffic flow is difficult because the behaviour of drivers cannot be predicted with 100% certainty.
Fortunately, drivers tend to behave within a reasonable range; thus traffic processes are generally of reasonable consistency and can be roughly represented mathematically.
In order to better represent the flow of traffic, a correlation was found between three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density and (3) speed.
These links help to plan, design and operate the road-side facilities.
Insects were the first animals to take to the air, and their ability to fly helped them to avoid enemies more easily and to find food and mates more efficiently.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings back along their body.
This gives them more space to hide from predators.
Today, only the beggars and the beggars can't fold their hind wings.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus claimed that the solar system revolved around the sun.
Some thought he was right, but many believed otherwise; that the solar system revolves around the earth, including the sun (and indeed the other stars).
That makes sense, because you don't feel like the Earth is spinning, right?
The Amazon is the largest and second longest river on Earth, with a water supply more than eight times that of the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, at six miles wide at one point.
20 percent of the river water that flows into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The main river, the Amazon, is 3,980 miles long, draining thousands of smaller rivers.
Although the stone pyramids continued to be built until the end of the Empire, they never surpassed the size and structure of the pyramids of Giza.
Ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom were fascinated by monuments built by their ancestors, which were well over a millennium old at the time.
Vatican City has a population of about 800, making it the smallest and least populous independent country in the world.
The Vatican uses Italian in its legislation and official communication.
Italian is also the everyday language used by the majority of the state employees, while Latin is used most often in religious ceremonies.
All the citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholics.
People have known about the basic chemical elements of gold, silver, and copper since ancient times, since all of these can be found in the form of raw materials in nature and can be mined relatively easily even with primitive tools.
Aristotle, the philosopher, thought that all of the elements were composed of one or more of the four elements: earth, water, air, and fire.
It was more like four layers of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gaseous, and plasma, although he thought they would become new, visible materials.
An alloy is basically a mixture of two or more metals.
Calcium, potassium, and the like are considered metals, and of course there are other metals, like silver and gold.
Some alloys may contain small amounts of non-metallic elements, such as carbon.
Everything in the universe is made up of matter, all matter is made up of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly small, they could fit trillions of them in the endpoints of sentences.
So when the pencil came out, it did a lot of good for a lot of people.
Unfortunately, as new writing methods developed, the pencil was placed in a lower status and used less.
People are now typing messages on computer screens and never getting near a mountain.
We can only guess what the keyboard will look like when they come up with something new.
The fission bomb works on the principle that it takes energy to collide a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
It's like driving a heavy wagon up a mountain, and the fission of the nucleus releases some of that energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means they sometimes split apart for little effect or even by themselves.
The surface of the moon is made of rocks and dust, and the outer layer of the moon is called the crust.
The crust is about 70 km thick on the near side and 100 km thick on the far side.
It is thinner under the marshes and thicker under the plateaus.
It's possible there's more black rocks nearby because the crust is thinner, and the lava is easier to lift to the surface.
Content theory focuses on what drives people, or what triggers their interest.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that are internalized as they grow into adulthood.
These theories look at what makes certain people want to do the things they do, and what in their environment makes them do those things or not.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs and Herzberg's two-factor theory.
"There are basically two behaviors that can develop when leaders start to lead their former colleagues. One end of the spectrum is when they try to stay "one with the guys" (or girls)".
Such a leader has difficulty making unpopular decisions, conducting disciplinary procedures, conducting performance evaluations, determining responsibilities, and holding people accountable.
On the other end of the spectrum, someone becomes an unrecognizable individual who feels that everything that the group has created must be changed and made his own.
Ultimately, the leader is responsible for the success or failure of his team.
This behavior often creates conflict between the leaders and the rest of the group.
Virtual teams are measured on the same scale as traditional teams, but there are slight differences.
Virtual team members often act as liaisons for the direct physical group.
They have more independence than traditional team members, because their teams can meet in different time zones, which local management is not sure they understand.
The presence of a real invisible team (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p. 109) is also a unique feature of the virtual team.
"The 'invisible team' is the leadership team, to whom the members are accountable.
Why would an organisation go through the time-consuming process of becoming a learning organisation?One of the goals of implementing learning concepts within organisations is innovation.
When all available resources are used efficiently in functional areas of an organization, creativity and ingenuity can surface.
As a result, the process of working together to overcome barriers leads to a new innovative process within the organisation to meet the needs of customers.
Before an organisation can innovate, management must create a culture of innovation and knowledge sharing and organisational learning.
Angel (2006) explains the continuum principle as a method that can help organisations achieve greater performance.
Neurobiological data provide physical evidence for a theoretical approach to the study of cognition, so it narrows the field of research and makes it much more precise.
The link between brain pathology and behavior is corroborated by the observations of scientists.
It has long been known that various brain injuries, traumas, wounds, and tumors can affect behavior and even alter certain mental abilities.
The rise of new technologies allows us to observe brain structures and processes never seen before.
And that gives us a lot of information and material that we can use to build simulations to understand what processes are going on in our minds.
Despite its strong science-fiction overtones, AI is actually a very important branch of computing that deals with the behavior, learning and intelligent adaptation of machines.
Research into artificial intelligence involves creating machines that automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Such as control, planning and scheduling, the ability to respond to customer diagnoses and questions, and handwriting, voice and facial recognition.
These things have become independent disciplines that focus on solving real-life problems.
AI systems are now widely used in economic, medical, technical, and military fields, as well as in the software of many home computers and video games.
Classroom trips are a big part of every classroom, and teachers often and willingly take their students to places where bus trips are not possible.
Technology allows virtual excursions, where students can view museum art, visit an aquarium, or admire any artwork while sitting in the classroom.
Sharing a virtual class trip experience with others is also a great way to reflect on the trip and share the experiences with future classes.
For example, students at the Bennet School in North Carolina design a website every year about their visit to the state capital, and they revise the website every year, but as a memoir, they keep the old versions available online.
Blogs can also help improve students' writing, and while students often start their blogging experience with sloppy grammar and spelling, the appearance of the audience usually changes that.
Since students are often the most critical of audiences, the blogger considers the development of writing skills to be key to avoiding criticism.
At the same time, blogging arra forces students to better understand the world around them. Maintaining the interest of the audience encourages students to be thoughtful and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that inspires collaboration and encourages students to extend learning significantly beyond the traditional school day.
The correct use of blogs  can prepare students to become more analytical and critical; active response to online material can help students to define their position on other people's writing and their own point of view on certain issues (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada's fascinating bilingual capital, and it has many art collections and museums that reveal Canada's past and present.
To the south are Niagara Falls and to the north is the unspoiled natural beauty of Muskoka.
These, along with many other things, present Ontario to foreigners in an unadulterated Canadian light.
To the north, they are found in vast, sparsely populated areas and sometimes in almost completely uninhabited wilderness.
A population figure that surprises many: there are more African-Americans in the United States than there are Canadians.
The East African Islands lie in the Indian Ocean near the eastern coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest continent in terms of wildlife, and it is considered a continent in its own right.
Most of the smaller islands are associated with independent nations or France and are famous for their luxury beaches.
The Arabs also brought Islam with them, and they conquered large areas in the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonization began in the 15th century when Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the Cape Route route from Europe to India.
The northern part of the region is bordered by the Sahel, the western and southern parts by the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: Women travelers are recommended to declare themselves married regardless of marital status.
It is also useful to wear a ring (but not one that looks very expensive).
Women need to understand that cultural differences can lead to things that they may perceive as harassment, and it's not uncommon for them to be followed, grabbed by the arm, etc.
Be firm in rejecting men, and don't be afraid to stand up for yourself (cultural differences here and there are not acceptable!)
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the tenth century B.C.E. and was used as a strategic port by the Phoenicians, Romans, and Marinids, all of whom called it Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it as Casa Branca, only to abandon it in 1755 after an earthquake.
The Moroccan sultan Daru l-Badya rebuilt the city, and Spanish traders named it Casablanca, establishing their trading base there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places in Morocco to shop.
In the vicinity of the old medina, it is easy to find places selling traditional Moroccan products such as saunas, soups, leather goods, water pipes and all kinds of snacks, but it is all for tourists.
Goma is a tourist town located in the easternmost part of the Democratic Republic of Congo, near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was devastated by the lava of the Nyiragongo volcano, which buried most of the city's streets, especially in the city center.
Although Goma is relatively safe, it is important to be informed about the ongoing fighting in North Kivu province before visiting outside Goma.
The city is the starting point for climbing the Nyragongo volcano, and it is also one of the cheapest places in Africa to observe mountain gorillas.
The boda boda (motorcycle) is used for transportation within Goma, with a standard (local) fare of around 500 CFA for a shorter journey.
It is associated with its relative seclusion and is also used as a metaphor for the exotic, remote landscape of Timbuktu.
Today, Timbuktu is a poor city, although its reputation has made it a tourist attraction and an airport.
In 1990, it was added to the list of World Heritage Sites in Danger because of the threat of desert sand.
This was one of the main stations on the Henry Louis Gates PBS series "Wonders of the African World".
The city stands in stark contrast to other cities in the country, as it has an Arab rather than African feel.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the northeastern part of South Africa, bordering Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and the Crocodile River to the south.
The park covers 19,500 square kilometers and is divided into 14 different ecoregions, each of which is home to a different species.
It is one of South Africa's main attractions and is the flagship of the South African National Parks.
As with all South African national parks, the conservation and entrance fees have to be changed.
"It may also be useful to purchase a wild card, which will give you access to either selected South African parks or all South African national parks".
Hong Kong is named after Hong Kong Island, and it is a place of interest to many tourists.
The parade of buildings that make up the skyline of Hong Kong is like a glittering column diagram, further enhanced by the waters of Victoria Harbour.
For the best view of Hong Kong, leave the island and head to the Kowloon waterfront opposite.
The urban area of Hong Kong Island is densely populated on reclaimed land along the northern coast.
This is the site that the English colonists occupied, so if you're looking for evidence of the area's colonial past, this is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans are the world's largest mangrove swamp, stretching 50 miles from the coast to the Bangladesh and Indian hinterland.
The Sundarbans is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The forest in India is called Sundarbans National Park.
But the forests are not just mangrove swamps - they also contain some of the last remnants of the vast jungle that once covered the entire Gangetic plain.
The Sundarbans cover an area of 3,850 km2, of which about one third is covered by water/marshland.
The Sundarbans has been a wildlife sanctuary since 1966, and it is estimated that there are now 400 Bengal tigers and approximately 30,000 deer.
Buses run from the Inter-Regional Bus Station (across the river) all day, but most of them, especially those heading east and towards Jakar/Bumthang, leave between 06:30 and 07:30.
Since inter-city buses are often full, it is recommended to buy a ticket a few days in advance.
Most of the districts are served by small Japanese shore buses, which are comfortable and load-bearing.
A one-way taxi is a quick and convenient way to visit nearby places such as Paro (Nu 150) and Punakha (Nu 200).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge across the Oyapock River to connect the city of Oiapoque in Brazil with the city of Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The two towers rise to a height of 83 meters, are 378 meters long, and have two 3.5 meter wide lanes.
The vertical distance under the bridge is 15 metres. Construction was completed in August 2011, but it was only opened to traffic in March 2017.
The bridge is expected to be fully operational in September 2017, when the Brazilian customs clearance points are estimated to be ready.
The Guarani were the most important indigenous group in what is now eastern Paraguay, living a semi-nomadic life as hunters and subsistence farmers.
The Chaco region was also home to other groups of indigenous tribes, such as the Guaycuru and Payagua, who lived by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
The 16th-century Paraguay, formerly known as the "Great Indian Territory", was created by the encounter between Spanish conquistadors and groups of indigenous people.
The Spanish began a colonial phase that lasted three centuries.
Since its founding in Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to retain a significant part of its indigenous traits and identity.
Argentina is famous for having one of the best water polo teams and players in the world.
The biggest race of the year is in December at the Las Cañitas Racecourse.
At other times of the year, less prestigious competitions and matches can also be viewed here.
For news about the championships and the purchase of tickets for polo matches, please visit the website of the Asociación Argentina de Polo.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland pound (FKP), which is equivalent in value to the British pound (GBP).
Currency exchange is only possible at the only bank on the islands, which is in Stanley, across from the FIC West store.
The British pound is generally accepted anywhere in and around the islands, and can often be paid with a Stanley credit card and US dollars.
In more remote islands, credit cards are unlikely to be accepted, although British and American currencies may still be accepted.
It's almost impossible to exchange Falkland currency outside the islands, so exchange money before you leave the island.
Since Montevideo is south of the Equator, it is summer there when winter is in the northern hemisphere and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropics; temperatures above +30°C are common in the summer months.
Winters can be deceptively cold, with temperatures rarely below freezing, but the combination of wind and humidity makes it colder than the thermometer shows.
There are no particularly rainy and dry seasons: the amount of rainfall is about the same throughout the year.
Although many animals in the park are used to meeting people, this still makes the wildlife wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
The park authority says you should keep at least 100 yards away from bears and wolves and 25 yards away from any other wildlife.
However permissive they may seem, buffalo, baboons, elk, bears, and almost any large animal can attack.
Dozens of visitors are injured every year because they didn't keep their distance, and these animals are big, wild, and potentially dangerous, so they have to be left to their own devices.
Also, it is important to know that smells attract bears and other wildlife, so be careful not to cook or bring any food with a strong aroma, and keep the camp clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa, located on the island of Upolu, and has a population of just under 40,000.
Apia was founded in 1850 and became the capital of Samoa in 1959.
The port was the site of a notorious naval battle in 1889 when seven ships from Germany, the United States, and Great Britain refused to leave the port.
All but one British battleship was sunk, with about 200 American and German lives lost.
During the independence struggle organized by the Mau movement, Grand Chief Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III was killed at a peaceful rally in the city.
There are many beaches, as Auckland is connected by two ports, the most popular being located in three areas.
The North Shore beaches (in the North Harbour district) are found along the Pacific coast, and stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Almost all sandy beaches are safe to swim on, and most are shaded by pohutukawa trees.
Tamaki Drive beaches are located at Waitemata Harbour, in the expensive suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers, in central Auckland.
These are sometimes crowded family beaches with a variety of shops lining the shore.
"The main local beer is 'Number One.' It's not a complex beer, but it's nice and refreshing.
There's plenty of French wine, but New Zealand and Australia are better for the journey.
The local tap water is perfectly safe to drink, but if you're worried, it's easy to find bottled water.
Flat white coffee is unfamiliar to Australians, with the short black called espresso, the cap wire stacked with cream (not foam), and the tea served without milk.
Hot chocolate is Belgian, and the juices are expensive, but of excellent quality.
Many visitors come to the reef throughout the year, and injuries resulting from this are rare.
Nevertheless, follow the advice of the authorities, follow the instructions on the signs, and pay close attention to the safety warnings.
Since 1770, rock jellyfish have been found near beaches and river mouths from October to April, and occasionally elsewhere during these times.
Sharks do occur, but they rarely attack humans, and most sharks are afraid of humans and prefer to stay away.
Saltwater crocodiles do not live in the ocean, their primary habitat being the river mouths north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance gives the traveler the peace of mind of having a place to sleep when he arrives at his destination.
Travel agents often have special offers for certain hotels, although it is possible that you may book other types of accommodation through a travel agent, such as camping.
Travel agents usually offer packages that include breakfast, airport transfers or even combined air travel and accommodation packages.
They may even keep the reservation for you if you need time to reconsider the offer or to obtain other documents (such as a visa) necessary for your destination.
Any changes or requests should be sent to the travel agent first, not directly to the hotel.
At some music festivals, a significant majority of participants choose to camp on-site, and most consider it an essential part of the experience.
If you want to get close to the action, you'll have to arrive early to get to a campsite close to the music.
Remember that even though the concert on the main stage has ended, there may be areas of the festival that continue to play music into the late night.
Some festivals have separate camping areas for families with young children.
If you're cruising the northern Baltic Sea in winter, be careful where you put the cabin, because sailing through the ice can make a terrible noise for those too close.
The tour of St. Petersburg is part of the sightseeing tour.
Casinos generally make a lot of effort to maximize the time and money spent by guests, and there are usually no windows or clocks, and exits are difficult to find.
They usually have special food, drink, and entertainment to keep the guests in the room.
In some places, alcoholic beverages are also offered at the expense of the house, but drunkenness can impair judgment, and every good gambler knows the importance of staying sober.
On all high altitudes or mountain passes, the driver shall take into account the possibility of snow, ice or sub-freezing temperatures.
Ice and snow roads are low in friction and cannot be driven like bare asphalt.
During blizzards, as much snow as is necessary to cause a traffic jam can fall in a very short time.
The visibility may be limited by snowfall or snow blowing, by impact of wind or by ice on the windows of the vehicle.
On the other hand, ice and snow conditions are common in many countries, and traffic is uninterrupted year-round.
African safaris are perhaps the most attractive tourist attractions and provide a unique experience for visitors.
The term safari in popular usage refers to overland trips to see the amazing wildlife of Africa, especially the savannah.
Some animals, such as giraffes and elephants, venture close to cars, so that they are easily observed with ordinary equipment.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards are sometimes shy, and they are better seen with a telescope.
A walking safari (also called a hiking safari, hiking safari, or walking) consists of a few hours or days of hiking.
The Paralympics will be held from August 24 to September 5, 2021, with some events taking place in other locations in Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to host two Summer Olympics, having hosted the 1964 games.
If you booked your flight and boarding for 2020 before the delay was announced, you might find yourself in a strange situation.
Cancellation conditions vary, but since late March most coronavirus-based cancellation conditions do not extend to July 2020, when the Olympics were scheduled.
Tickets for events are expected to cost between ¥2500 and ¥130,000, with tickets typically priced around ¥7000.
Ironing wet clothes helps dry them, and in many hotels you can find ironing boards and ironing tables that you can use even if you don't have one in your room.
If you don't have an ironing board or don't like wearing ironing socks, you can try using a hair dryer if you have one.
Be careful not to allow the tissue to overheat (which may cause shrinkage or, in extreme cases, peeling).
There are many ways to purify water, some of which are more effective against specific threats.
In some areas, boiling water for one minute is sufficient, while in others it takes longer.
The efficiency of filters varies, and if you are concerned, consider buying water in a sealed bottle from a reputable company.
Travelers may encounter pests that they may not have encountered before in their homes.
Pests can spoil food, cause irritation, or worse, allergic reactions, and can spread poisons or infections.
Infectious diseases themselves, or dangerous animals that can injure or kill humans, are generally not considered pests.
Duty-free purchases are purchases of goods at certain locations free of taxes and levies.
Travellers to heavily taxed countries can sometimes save a considerable amount, especially on alcoholic beverages and tobacco products.
The section between Point Marion and Fairmont is the most challenging in terms of driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh freeway, which often runs through isolated, back-sliding areas.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, keep your eyes open. The road is marked by steep climbs, narrow lanes, and sharp turns.
The published speed limits are significantly lower than those in the previous and subsequent sections  generally 3540 mph (5664 km/h)  and strict adherence to them is of paramount importance.
Interestingly, the signal is much stronger here than in other parts of the route, like the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German bakery is very good, and in Bavaria, it's quite rich and varied, which is similar to its southern neighbors, Austria.
Fruit cakes are common: apples are baked all year round, cherries and plums are baked in summer.
Many German pastries, however, include almonds, nuts, and other shelled fruits.
If you like some small but elaborate cakes, try the following, depending on the region: Berliner, Pfannkuchen, or Krapfen.
Curry is a herbal and spicy food made with meat or vegetables.
"Curry can be either "dry" or "juicy" depending on how much liquid it contains".
In the interior of northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is often used, while in southern India and other coastal areas of the subcontinent, coconut juice is commonly used to make curry.
With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian cuisine is a catch-all term that encompasses a vast array of cuisines from the country's landscapes.
However, when used without other qualification, the term refers mostly to foods from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
The Java cuisine, which is widespread throughout the archipelago, offers a variety of simple spices, with the flavours of peanut, chili, sugar (especially coconut) and various aromatic spices dominating the flavours of Java.
The horse's legs are held by hinges on either side of the saddle.
They provide greater stability for the rider, but their use raises safety concerns as the rider's foot may become trapped.
If the horse drops the rider but the leg gets stuck in the saddle, the horse can pull it along if you cut it further.
First, most competitors wear smooth, narrow-footed riding boots with angles.
Some sleds, especially English sleds, are then fitted with safety bars that allow the sling to fall off the sled if the competitor pulls it back while falling.
The Cochamo Valley is a prominent mountaineering destination in Chile, known as South America's Yosemite, with its various large granite walls and fissures.
The mountaintops offer breathtaking views, and climbers from all over the world are constantly making new routes through the walls of endless opportunity.
Snowshoeing, including skiing and snowboarding, is a popular sport, including snowboarding on snow-covered terrain with a ski or a snowboard attached to the foot.
Skiing is a major travel activity with a significant fan base, and fans are sometimes called ski lovers, and they plan entire vacations around skiing in a particular location.
The idea of skiing is very old - cave paintings depicting skiers date back to 5000 B.C.
Skiing as a sport dates back to at least the 17th century, and the first recreational ski club was opened by Norwegians in Australia in 1861.
Backpack skiing: also called backcountry skiing, hiking or sit-skiing.
It is related to but not usually accompanied by an alpine style of skiing or mountaineering, the latter done on steep terrain and with much tighter skiing boots.
Interpret the ski route as a hiking trail.
Under good conditions, it will be able to cover more distance than it can on foot - but it will rarely reach the speed required for skiing without a heavy backpack on groomed tracks.
Europe is a relatively small continent with many independent countries.Under normal circumstances, crossing several countries would mean having to go through visa applications and passport checks several times.
But the Schengen area, in this respect, operates somewhat like a country.
As long as you stay in this zone, you will not normally need to pass through any further passport control points when crossing the borders.
Similarly, a Schengen visa does not require the exchange of a separate visa in each Schengen Member State, saving time, money and paperwork.
There is no general definition of which items are antiques, and some tax authorities define antiques as being over 100 years old.
The definition varies by geographical location, with some where this age range is shorter than in Europe, such as in North America.
The Commission therefore concludes that the measures in question constitute State aid within the meaning of Article 107 (1) of the Treaty.
Reindeer farming was - and still is - an important source of livelihood for the Seminole people, and the culture surrounding the business is important to many other occupations.
Traditionally, not all the Samans were involved in large-scale reindeer herding, but they subsisted on fishing, hunting, and the like, using the reindeer mostly as recreational animals.
Today, many Sámi are employed in modern trades.
Although widely used, especially among non-Roma, the word gypsy is often considered offensive, as it is associated with negative stereotypes and inaccurate judgments of Roma people.
If the country you wish to visit is the subject of a travel warning, this may affect your travel health insurance or travel cancellation insurance.
It can also seek advice from other governments, but those governments have tailored their advice to their own citizens.

Extreme weather is a collective term for any hazardous weather phenomenon that can cause damage, severe social disruption, or even death.
Extreme weather can occur anywhere in the world and is of many types, depending on geography, topography, and environmental conditions.
High winds, hail, excessive rainfall, and wildfires are manifestations and consequences of extreme weather, along with storms, tornadoes, avalanches, and cyclones.
Regional and seasonal extreme weather events include snowstorms, hailstorms and dust storms.
Travellers are strongly advised to be aware of the severe weather risks in the area as these may affect their travel plans.
If you are planning to visit a country that is considered a war zone, you should take some training.
If we search the Internet for the words "Hostile Environment Course", we'll probably get the address of a local company.
The course usually covers all the problems discussed here in greater detail, in most cases combined with practical experience.
A course usually lasts 2-5 days and includes role-playing, lots of first aid and sometimes weapons training.
Books and magazines on wildlife survival are common, but publications on war zones are rare.
Passengers planning non-altering surgery abroad should ensure that they have valid documents for the return journey.
Governments differ in their willingness to issue a passport without an X or a document that includes the new name and gender.
The willingness of foreign governments to respect these documents is just as variable.
The security checkpoints became much more disturbing in the period after September 11, 2001.
Transgender people who are about to undergo surgery cannot expect their privacy and dignity to be protected from being compromised by the body scan.
Returning currents are the returning currents of waves that break away from the shore, often at a reef or similar.
The underwater topology has caused the returning flow to be concentrated in some of the deeper sections, and a rapid flow can occur in the deep water there.
Most fatalities are caused by fatigue when trying to swim against the current, which is almost impossible.
Once the current is out of the way, swimming back to shore is no more difficult than on the mainland.
Try to target a place where you won't be swept away by the current again, or, depending on your ability and whether you're noticed, it's worth waiting for rescue.
Reverse culture shock occurs much earlier than culture shock (the lesser honeymoon phase), lasts longer and can be more severe.
Travelers who have adapted easily to a new culture may find it particularly difficult to adjust again to their own original culture.
When they return home after their time abroad, they adjust to the new culture and abandon some of the customs of their home culture.
When you first traveled abroad, people were likely patient and understanding, recognizing that travelers to a new land would have to adjust.
People probably don't think that returning travelers need patience and understanding.
The pyramid's sound and light display is one of the most interesting sights for children in the area.
We can see the pyramids in the dark and silence before the show starts.
Usually, you can hear the sounds of tourists and vendors here, and the story told by the sound and the light is like a storybook.
The sphinx provides the backdrop and is the narrator of a long story.
The scenes are projected onto the pyramids and the various pyramids are illuminated.
The South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, are claimed by a number of countries and this area has the most bases, with sixteen active bases in 2020.
The group of islands lies 120 km north of the peninsula, the largest being King George Island, with the settlement of Villa Las Estrellas.
These include Livingston Island and Deception Island, which are now flooded by a still-active volcano and form a spectacular natural harbor.
Ellsworth Land is the area south of the peninsula bounded by the Bellingshausen Sea.
The mountains of the peninsula merge with the plains and rise again, forming the 200-mile-long Ellsworth Range, which is cut in two by the Minnesota glacier.
In the northern part, or Sentinel Range, is the highest mountain in Antarctica, Mount Vinson, which tops Mount Winston at 4,892 m (14,090 ft).
In remote areas where there is no cellular communication, satellite phone may be the only solution.
Satellite telephones are not usually a substitute for mobile phones, as you have to be outdoors to make a phone call, with unobstructed satellite views.
The service is often used for shipping, including pleasure shipping and expeditions requiring data and voice telecommunications.
The local telephone company can give you more information on how to connect to the service.
Increasingly popular is the so-called gap year option for travel and study.
This is particularly popular with graduates, allowing them to skip a year before university without jeopardizing their studies.
In many cases, a course taken abroad during the missed year can actually increase your chances of entering higher education back home.
Participation in these educational programmes is usually subject to tuition fees.
"Finland is a great boating destination. "The Land of a Thousand Lakes" also has thousands of small islands in the lake and coastal archipelago world".
Inland lakes and islands don't necessarily require a yacht.
Although the coastal islands and the largest lakes are large enough for yachting, smaller boats or even kayaks can provide other experiences.
Boating is a national pastime in Finland, and one in seven or eight people own a boat.
This is also the case in Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but is otherwise quite unique (for example, in the Netherlands, the ratio is 1 in 40).
Most of the prominent Baltic shipping routes offer a long stopover in St. Petersburg, Russia.
That means you can visit the historic city for a few days, spending the night on the boat.
If you only come to the coast by boat, you will not need a separate visa (since 2009).
Some cruise brochures also list Berlin, Germany, as shown on the map above, which is not near the sea at all and is not included in the price of the cruise.
Flying can be intimidating for people of all ages and backgrounds, especially if they have never flown before or have had a traumatic experience.
There's no shame in that: it's like personal fears or dislikes -- there are a lot of people who are like that.
For some, a partial understanding of how aircraft operate and what happens during flight can help them overcome fears that are rooted in a lack of knowledge or control.
Courier companies pay well for fast delivery, so time is key when it comes to business documents, goods, or urgent repairs to parts.
On certain routes, the larger companies have their own aircraft, but there were problems on other routes and with smaller companies.
If goods are shipped by air, it may take days on some routes for the goods to unpack and pass through customs.
We've listed it as checked baggage for faster transit, but airline regulations don't allow a package to be sent without a passenger, so that's where you come in.
The obvious way to fly first class or business class is to flip a thick bundle of banknotes for privilege (or, better yet, get your company to do it for you).
However, it is not cheap: you can generally expect to pay four times the usual fare in business class and eleven times the usual fare in first class.
Generally speaking, there's no point in looking for discounts on business or first-class places between points A and B.
The airlines know that there are certain groups of passengers who are willing to pay large sums for the privilege of getting somewhere quickly and comfortably, so they charge a corresponding fee.
The capital of Moldova is Kishinov. The local language is Romanian, but Russian is also widely spoken.
Moldova is a multi-ethnic republic, which suffers from ethnic conflicts.
In 1994, this conflict led to the arbitrary proclamation of the Dniester-Moldovan Republic in Eastern Moldova, with its own government and currency, but the country is not recognized by any UN member state.
Despite the failure of political negotiations, economic relations between these two parts of Moldova were restored.
Orthodox Christianity is the main religion in Moldova.

The Parisian crude behavior will quickly disappear if we follow some basic politeness rules.
The Plitvice Lakes National Park is a very forested area, mostly with beech, poplar and coniferous trees and a combination of Alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
It has a particularly diverse vegetation community, due to its microclimate range, different soil types and different altitude levels.

Rare animals are found here, such as the European brown bear, wolf, eagle, owl, he-goat, wildcat, and deafling, as well as many other common species
When visiting monasteries, women must wear a knee-cap skirt and cover their shoulders.
Most monasteries provide scarves for women who arrive unprepared, but if you bring your own, especially one of a bright color, you'll get a smile from the friar or nun at the entrance.
Following the same principle, men should wear pants that cover the knee.
You can also borrow these from the entrance stocks, but the clothes aren't washed after every use, so you might not be comfortable wearing these skirts.
Mallorcan cuisine, like other Mediterranean cuisines, uses mainly bread, vegetables and meat (especially pork) and olive oil for everything.

Nevertheless, people who know a little Spanish are quick to conclude that Portuguese is close enough that it does not need to be learned separately.
Pre-modern observatories are now obsolete and are being turned into museums or educational centers.
Light pollution was not such a problem in their day, so they are most often found in cities or on university campuses, where they are more accessible than their modern counterparts.
Most modern research telescopes are a huge piece of equipment in an isolated area with favorable atmospheric conditions.
Watching the cherry blossom, known as hanami, has been a part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
