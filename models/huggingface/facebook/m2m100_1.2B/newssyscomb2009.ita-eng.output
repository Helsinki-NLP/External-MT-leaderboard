The triumph of the right-wing populists in Austria: in total they have 29%
The noticeable weakening of both existing parties in the big coalition and this marked strengthening of right-wing populist parties led, according to the first provisional results, to early parliamentary elections on Sunday in Austria.
The Austrian People’s Party (ÖVP), within which the position of current President Wilhelm Molterer is seriously oscillating, suffered strong losses.
On the contrary, the electoral leader of the Union for the Future of Austria (BZÖ), Kärnten deputy prefect Jörg Haider, is preparing a triumphant return to national politics.
According to the preliminary results, the strongest party in the country remains the Social Democratic Party (SPÖ) with 29.8% of the votes, but loses 5.5% compared to the last election in 2006.
Even worse went for ÖVP, which lost with 25.6% almost 9% of the votes.
These are the worst outcomes of these two major parties in Austrian post-war history and especially the literally catastrophic outcome of the popular, which provoked early elections.
Even at the beginning of July, when the ÖVP left the coalition, the people had a significant advantage over SPÖ in preferences.
But the voters have clearly punished them for sinking the government.
Even in the early reactions to the results there were speculations about the possible resignation of the party’s chairman, Deputy Chancellor Wilhelm Monterer.
Observers believe it could happen on Monday during the extraordinary meeting of the party’s leadership.
This evolution should facilitate the path to the increasingly likely way out of the election outcome, that is, to the renewal of the SPÖ and ÖVP coalition.
Regarding the strengthening of both right-wing populist parties – the Liberals (FPÖ) gained 18% and the BZÖ 11% of the votes in advance – but the Social Democrats simultaneously revealed the concern of another 1999, when the populists agreed with the populists to the collective government, (then the FPÖ was still united, in 2005 it separated from the BZÖ) which was even the cause of sanctions by the European Union.
On this evolution obviously plays Haider, who has already stated that he is ready to collaborate with any party and assumes a return to Vienna in national politics.
The Greens also managed to enter Parliament, but fell slightly, falling from third to fifth place among the Austrian political parties.
No other party has clearly crossed the 4% threshold and has not entered Parliament.
Schwarzenberg: Relations with India can be cooled
If the problem with the Czech scientists who were accused of illegally harvesting scarabies in India were not resolved, a certain cooling of the Czech-Indian relations would take place, according to Czech Foreign Minister Karel Schwarzenberg.
The Minister mentioned this in New York after meeting today with his Indian counterpart Pranab Mukherjee.
"If it is not resolved, then there will be a certain cooling," he said after the meeting that took place under the Czech initiative.
Mukherjee said after the negotiations that the executive could hardly interfere in legal matters.
However, he noted that in the case of Petr Švácha, who has been acquitted from the charge and punished with a fine, the central government can negotiate with the local government in Dardjeeling, which falls under its jurisdiction.
“Your problem could be solved,” the minister said.
According to Mukherjee, it would be better, for Emil Kučera sentenced to three years in prison, to resort to a higher instance.
He can then ask for release on bail and wait for the judgment in freedom.
Schwarzenberg confirmed that his partner expressed the same during the negotiations.
"Recommend the appeal to the High Court then it will be possible to obtain the grace," said the head of Czech diplomacy.
The only way the Czech side can get involved in the case is to provide the convicted with "competent legal support," the Indian minister said.
At the same time, he said that such support is already being provided by the Indian side.
“We have the greatest interest inining the best relations that have been passed on for many years with India.
The Indians also acknowledge this," Schwarzenberg said.
At the same time, as he told ČTK, in front of his partner he stressed that the Czech Republic attaches great importance to the problem of Czech entomologists.
"We really consider the imprisonment and prosecution of these Czech scientists a profound mistake," he said.
The minister avoided answering the question whether he had obtained from the Indian side the promise to take care of the matter.
“I got relatively many promises,” he just noted.
A Czech judge in the battle for the seabed
It approaches the electronic map on the wall on which Australia and adjacent marine areas are drawn.
But he is not interested in the continent but in a small point lost in the blue of the ocean.
The island belongs to Australia and with it the adjacent seabed.
The area is as large as the continent itself, says Italian lawyer Luigi Santosuosso, who is part of a team of 33 UN Oceans and Maritime Rights Division workers.
Its chief, the Czech lawyer director of the Division, Václav Mikulka, is following his exhibition and occasionally adds something.
It dominates the desire to work and enthusiasm.
The ocean floor still hides a little-known world rich in natural resources.
It is possible to find oil, metal minerals and other minerals, but also unknown living organisms that carry within themselves the key to the discovery of cancer medicine.
The largest land of the continent
Coastal states have begun to pay interest to underwater territory.
According to the UN convention, that is, they take advantage of the laws they agreed on in 1982 in Montego Bay, Jamaica.
This is mainly the area of the so-called continental platform that often extends up to several hundred kilometers from the coast of the state in question.
It has an exclusive right to all resources on the continental platform.
In short, by continental platform is meant that part of the seabed and its subsoil which is a natural extension of the continent under the sea.
The so-called exclusive economic zone extends beyond the territorial sea often beyond 200 nautical miles,” explains Mikulka.
The request for which the country submits before the Commission for the definition of the size of the continental platform must be accompanied by a very extensive technical-scientific documentation based on many expensive surveys and measurements.
This is the result of many years of preparation.
“One of our tasks is to provide the commission with legal and technical-professional assistance.
The Commission has so far handled five requests from Russia, Brazil, Australia, Ireland and New Zealand.
Only the last three nominations have been successful,” Mikulka adds.
The recent success of Australia, which has greatly expanded its marine possessions, has recorded a world echo.
But New Zealand also earned us - the surface of the seabed, which was allocated to it by the commission last week, of about 1.6 square kilometers so more or less six times larger than the state itself.
Both countries have invested millions of dollars in research.
The profits, which they will bear from the seabed in the future, as they promise, will be invaluable.
Other countries will gradually submit their demands as well.
They can do so for ten years since the “Montego Bay Convention” was ratified.
Where the continental platform ends, begins the area of the ocean floor that the Convention has declared the common heritage of mankind.”
No country has an exclusive position.
The right of extraction in this area is granted by this international institution established by the Convention.
"But the seafloor is not Klondike," says exaggerating director Mikulka, "with the fact that its individual parts are legally demarcated and their regime established contractually."
Czechs in the Pacific
A portion of the sea floor now belongs to the Czech Republic.
It is shared with other states of the former Soviet bloc within the framework of the joint organization "Interoceanmetal".
This acquired in 1991 under the convention, as did investors from a few other states, the status of so-called "pioneering investor".
It has mining rights in the ClarionClipperton area in the Pacific Ocean between Mexico, the Hawaiian Islands and Kiribati.
The area explored by the investor is slightly larger than the former Czechoslovakia.
The bottom is broken, it is almost a submarine replica of Tatry.
“It’s possible to extract on the total area of 75 000 square kilometers.
The area is rich in polymetal agglomerates containing nickel, copper, cobalt and manganese,” said another Indian lawyer, Pakshi Rajan.
A Macedonian division worker, Rober Sandev, carries a record to show it.
It looks like a small potato or with a bit of fantasy, a legendary scheme, like in the legend of the Golem awakening.
German special forces were present at the release of the hostages
The Egyptian government had asked Germany for help in the release of the hostages – then experts arrived.
When the situation became critical, the special units were ready, but did not intervene.
The circumstances of the release of the 11 captured European hostages are getting more and more detailed.
In the rescue operation, the Ministry of Defense and the Ministry of the Interior said, German special units took part.
In addition to the military specialists, the GSG9 units, the Federal Aviation Police, the Federal Criminal Office, as well as the logistics experts of the technical institution were present.
As the ministry spokesman said on Monday night, German units did not intervene because the hijackers, in view of the danger of a force intervention, released the hostages by fleeing.
The Egyptian government accepted the help offered by the Germans, to join as assistance directly on the ground.
“We didn’t get there fortunately,” said a spokesman for the interior ministry.
On September 19, a group of travelers were abducted in southern Egypt: five Germans, five Italians, one Romanian as well as their eight Egyptian escorts.
After the abduction in a desert area in southern Egypt, the hostages were deported to the border area between Egypt, Libya, Sudan and Chad.
The identity of the kidnappers until the end has remained secret as well as the details of the release or possible ransom payments.
In the meantime, the liberated arrived in good condition in Cairo.
Steinmeier said the hostages are under the protection of the German embassy.
The details of the release were not disclosed.
In Berlin there was no information, for when they would return to Germany.
According to the newspaper "Bild", the five vacationers and special units are expected to take off on a military Airbus and arrive in Germany on Tuesday.
The U.S. House of Representatives rejected the rescue plan.
The first house of the U.S. Congress just failed the $700 billion bailout package for financial markets.
The Dow Jones is down.
With 206 to 227 votes, the U.S. House of Representatives rejected the government’s bailout plan.
Despite the appeals of U.S. President George W. Bush and leading politicians from both parties, there was no majority for the program, with which the chaos of the financial markets should have been curtailed.
In a dramatic action, supporters desperately tried to persuade critics with the heavy $700 billion package.
Barney Frank, one of the leaders of the negotiations, urged MEPs to consensus, even though the plan was unpopular.
It is hard to have gratitude to avoid something that has not yet arrived.
While the vote was ongoing, the Dow Jones fell more than 6 percent or 600 points.
The reason for investors’ concerns was that the state bailout package could fail.
It resumed before the end of the vote and then, after the announcement of failure, collapsed again.
Experts now expect further serious turmoil in the international financial markets.
In order for the plan to enter into force, it must be approved by both the House of Representatives and the Senate.
Promoters record increasing numbers of reservations
It looks like it will be a good winter for German tour operators:
According to one study, the turnover on travel bookings for the coming months compared to the previous year has increased significantly – for the winter season even by more than 30%.
In spite of weak outlook, the desire of the Germans to travel, according to a survey, remains firm.
On reservations for the winter season, the travel agencies registered a 31% increase in turnover compared to the same period of the previous year, as the German tourism association DRV on Monday in Berlin.
According to the survey of the market research institute GfK, there are increased booking rates already for the autumn months.
So the surplus of travel agencies for October compared to 2007 would amount to about 11%, the DRV.
The results are based on the figures of the GfK, which analyzes the booking data of 1200 German travel agencies monthly and makes statistical projections for the entire market.
It would also include travel bookings made until the end of August 2008.
Because of the weak price of the dollar, travel to the United States would be required in particular, the DRV.
The increase in reservations would amount to about a third.
It would also be travel destinations in demand from the Germans Spain, Turkey, Greece, as well as locations within Germany.
Especially all-inclusive trips have a high quote, explained DRV President Klaus Laepple.
Considering the rising costs for energy and food, the costs in this case would be "better calculable for customers than for an individually organized holiday."
Consumers could save money through, among other things, discounts on bookings made in advance or all-inclusive offers, Laepple explained.
Even the summer months would have recorded excellent booking figures, so that compared to the previous year, it would have again registered a surplus of revenue - although according to a further study the number of Germans who embarked on a trip, compared to the previous year decreased.
My first time at the Oktoberfest
Hits by Ballermann, one-liter bottle beer and vip in Dirndln graffiti.
Opening at Wiesn
Susanne Kronzucker and I do not actually have much in common.
She is a blonde, television host and wears a tailor-made Dirndl.
I have dark hair, I am a student and my dress is second-hand.
However, one thing is common to us: just 3 minutes at Wiesn, photographers are already kicking at us and taking photos to fill the memory of the cameras – very lush, and this at my first visit to Wiesn.
This is how you make friends.
The two-money Dirndl seems to its purpose.
As a tourist from Wiesn and a real resident north of the white salmon equator, the sense of well-being in costume/dress to this day is still within limits.
And once you get to Theresienwiese, there’s nothing serious about it.
Almost everyone wears the Dirndl or leather pants; no one looks disgusted or embarrassed – everything is perfectly normal.
Only my Dirndl’s bark gathers strange looks at the chocolate banana stand.
One monk pointed out to me that I would have attached the barrel in the wrong way: "On the left you are free, in the middle you are a virgin, on the right you are engaged, behind a widow."
It is the first time that we have been able to find a solution to this problem, and it is the first time that we have been able to find a solution.
“Well,” he says and laughs.
Others make less waste of subtle flirting techniques and wear sober feather hats, on which heads "To drunk to get dressed!" and stretch the naked back against an uninvited.
The boy with exhibitionist inclinations is called Bob, he comes from England and he also visits the Oktoberfest for the first time.
It finds it “gorgeous”, with a stitched “ooooo”..
This tells me, after he got rid of his glass of beer from a liter drank before.
Right next to one of these moisturizers, which everyone thinks is a pattumiera.
Bob is one of those famous “Wildbiesler.”
Others are not lucky enough to get rid of alcohol in this way.
It’s a good idea to be able to take a look at what you’re looking for.
The nurses appear every time in herd – always 4 at a time drag a tent-covered barrel into the tent.
This works as with most visitors to Wiesn: you go empty, you return full.
Whoever lies under the veil in this bar of alcohol rate in the blood,is not seen.
“Des sind die, wos goarnimmer packn,” cries one of the health care workers and disappears in the barracks.
Victim of accident identified by police
A 63-year-old woman who died in a hospital after being struck by a vehicle while walking in Essex has been identified.
Carole Paulson, from Chelmsford Road in Brentwood, was involved in the incident Friday afternoon on Shenfield Road in the city.
She was taken to the Queen's Hospital in Romford, but died shortly afterwards.
After the accident, a 51-year-old man was arrested on charges of careless driving.
He was released on bail.
Turkey expands its diplomatic horizons
Long before Turkey tried to join the European Union, European powers were eager to penetrate deep into the Turkish backland.
On the eastern side of the Bosphorus, 20 steps into Asia, is one of the most beautiful relics of this failed imperial ambition.
The Hydarpasha train station was designed by two German architects Otto Ritter and Helmut Conu in neo-Renaissance style.
At least that’s what the tour guides tell you.
The building is riding between the ends of the platforms with a tower on each of its corners looking at the world like some German provincial municipalities.
The stone is dirty.
The entire building slightly decayed.
But once inside the ticket office from ceiling to turn, there is no doubt about the size of the enterprise of what was the most western passage.
The station was opened in August 1908 by a German consortium, the Anatolia-Baghdad Corporation.
Germany, a retardant to the imperial game, wanted to realize its ambitions of dominating the Middle East through this railway that ran to Damascus, Baghdad and beyond in what is today Saudi Arabia.
But Germany’s imperial ambitions collapsed during the First World War.
His railways were attacked by Lawrence of Arabia and his irregular Arabs.
The relative isolation from the surrounding region, generated by the frozen borders of the Cold War, has passed.
British and dominant forces advanced out of Egypt and pushed the Turks and their German allies out of Palestine and Syria.
And there were bad news for Hyderpasha station as well.
In 1917 a train of ammunition exploded destroying its elaborate roof.
Turkish sources say it was sabotage.
Since then, it has slowly disappeared, largely overtaken by history.
But today, this railway outlet to Anatolia and all the points to the east, serves – at least symbolically – to highlight Turkey’s ever-expanding diplomatic horizons.
The ruling Justice and Development Party – the AKP – has created a whole new foreign policy for the country.
The relative isolation from its surrounding regions, generated by the frozen borders of the Cold War, has passed.
Now there is a new commitment policy.
Remarkably, the Turkish government has good relations with Israel and Syria, with the Palestinian factions of Hamas and Fatah, with Iraq and Iran and of course with the European Union and the United States.
To estimate the parameters of this new foreign policy, I embarked on the bed wagon for the Turkish capital Ankara, to visit one of the AKP’s leading foreign policy experts, Turkish MP Suat Kiniklioglu.
The next morning—about ten and a half hours later—after a run-off along the tracks that produced the ancient-world cadences of the famous documentary The Night Mail, I arrived in the Turkish capital—proposed as a new city for a century-old state intended to turn his back to its Ottoman past.
But the AKP with its well-known Islamic roots represents an exemplary shift in Turkish consensus.
He suggested some suspicions in the West, most notably in Washington.
A taxi takes me to the AKP headquarters, an ultra-modern stone and steel structure - built ad hoc - in a developing suburb, surrounded by medium-built shopping centers and power bakeries, where managers in complete - both men and women - meet to make early-morning contracts.
Suat Kiniklioglu could be a center-right politician than almost any other political party in Europe.
Complete, tie, I’m sure he also had a Blackberry.
“The goal of the foreign policy party now is to reintegrate Turkey with its closest neighbors.
The Cold War was an anomaly,” he said.
Turkey has been cut off from its interior.
He must look east and west at the same time.
It was not the case of one or the other.
They must be both.
“But at some point,” I ask, “will Turkey be forced to decide?”
“Turkey,” he says, “does not want to face that choice.”
Then he highlights a point that almost all of those with whom I have spoken here have recited in memory: the ties of the country not only with the Middle East, but also with the Caucasus, and all around the Black Sea, are of the same benefit to Europe and the United States as they are to Turkey.
With Turkey on board, the message seems to be, The whole of Europe can metaphorically travel those rail lines eastward through Asia and the Middle East.
Again at Hydarpasha station, after another night in white, I think of those two German gentlemen Herr Ritter and Herr Conu who had watched this building built 100 years ago.
They would be surprised to find that Europe’s Middle Eastern ambitions may now be largely in Turkey’s hands.
And as I wait at the terminal for the ferry that takes me back through the Bosphorus, I remember that in those days Turkey has always been called “the sick man of Europe.”
Then at least there seemed to be no doubt about which continent to make claims on this fascinating country.
Actors: Vernon Handley and William Woodruff
Mark Brown writes: As musical director of Guildford since 1962, Vernon "Tod" Handley (necrology, 11 September) had been in charge of the Guildford Philharmonic Orchestra and the choir.
As a member of his music scheme for the municipality, the following year he founded his wonderful youth choir, Proteus.
They were supposed to be under 21/ under 21, but at the time Proteus sang its final in 1979, many of us were over twenty – we simply refused to give up the choir.
The name "Proteus" (the mythological being-changing) represented the goodwill of the choir and the ability to face everything that music presented to do, both madrigals and Messiaen, without accompaniment or with the entire orchestra.
The musical versatility produced by such a young choir was often stunning, always exciting, and it was all because of that man’s inspiration and the enthusiasm for music that remained absolutely constant through the years.
How often was Tod telling us to “let the music speak for itself.”
He said, “The composer knows what he wants.
It’s all there, in music.
So sing it!”
His technique in the use of the stick was absolutely clear and precise, though never dictatorial nor flourished.
Whatever the musical standard, it made it increasingly higher.
John Frayn Turner wrote:
If an orchestra director were to be appointed a knight, it would have been Vernon Handley.
I knew him very well during the two decades he led the Guildford Philharmonic from 1962 to 1982.
Over the past 40 years and more I have touched on more than 100 of his concerts and I can honestly say that I have never disagreed with one of them - and many times inspired by them.
Tod Handley had that rare combination of personal greatness and modesty.
He hated orchestral directors who, in his words, simply “riding around the world one or two well-known battle horses.”
It will be missing so many of us.
William Woodruff
Professor John Beckett writes:
Your necrology of William Woodruff (25 September) specifies that "in 1946 he resumed studying economic history at Oxford and in 1950 he became a researcher at Houblon-Norman... studying at the same time for a bachelor's degree in science, a bachelor's degree in literature and a PhD."
This follows from Woodruff’s author’s note in Beyond Nab End, but it’s not correct.
From 1946 to 1953 he was a professor of economic history at the University of Nottingham, during which time he completed a PhD thesis on the British rubber industry, supervised by Professor J. D. Chambers, and subsequently published in 1958 as The British Rubber Industry.
He spent 1950-51 in the United States as a researcher at Houblon-Norman, and in the summer of 1952 at the universities of Illinois, Harvard and New York.
In 1953 he left Nottingham permanently for Illinois.
Why Woodruff chose to cover this part of his career, is not known.
J. Vincent Resino at the Faculty of Philology
“I recommend the exhibition “Flamenco y vida” by José Vicente Resino, because his photographs in black and white, in documentary style, are extraordinary.
They attracted my attention for the simplicity and strength they convey, while treating the protagonists with special respect.
This is a show that gives a lot of feelings.
He can capture magical moments.
Second strike for Honda’s surplus sales
In November, Honda will launch the second generation of the Jazz.
If the previous model was already equipped with great habitability, this new monovolume has an even wider interior space.
To all this, a refined mechanics must be added, which increases driving comfort and allows for fuel savings.
Evolution against revolution.
This is the second generation of the Honda Jazz.
Although aesthetically the new Jazz features a very similar line to that of the previous model, the changes in this monovolume are numerous.
Among other things, it is worth noting an innovative design, a new platform, larger dimensions and new mechanics.
However, before we go on to analyze the new model, it is useful to note that this new Jazz comes six years after entering the market of the first generation.
Therefore, a first observation is that Honda has renewed this model in shorter time than those used by other manufacturers.
Although the Jazz model is less known in Europe than in other markets, it remains a unique phenomenon in terms of sales.
This is exactly the case in Japan, where Jazz was the best-selling car in 2002 and also during this 2008.
Nearly one million units of the Jazz have been sold in Japan since its launch.
The second market was the Old Continent, with about half a million units in six years.
Despite these numbers, Honda believes the new Jazz will boost sales in the segment.
Thus, if in 2007 the Japanese company sold a total of 83,000 units of this model, for 2009 the estimates are around 100,000 cars, suggesting a 17% increase in sales in the European market.
As for the Spanish market, Honda has sold a total of 8,000 units of Jazz since 2002, which corresponds to 6.7% of Honda’s total sales in Spain.
As for the new generation, the managers of the Spanish subsidiary expect to sell around 2,000 units of Jazz over a year.
The arrival of the new Jazz will allow Honda to significantly reduce the decline in sales in Spain.
In fact, the managers of the company expect to arrive at the end of the year with a total of 22,000 units sold, or 4,000 fewer than in 2007, with a 16% drop.
Despite the increase in sales, Honda increased its market share in Spain to 1.8%, up from 1.6% last year.
In addition, the Japanese company expects to reach 2% in 2010.
To this, Honda is counting on the arrival of another new model.
This is Insight, a five-door hybrid and compact format – 4.37 meters in length – of which the Japanese company hopes to sell around 200,000 units a year worldwide.
For markets and according to estimates made by the Japanese manufacturer, 50% of the Insight sales will take place in the United States, while the remaining percentage will be distributed between the Old Continent and Japan.
The commercial launch of the Insight is scheduled for the first months of the year, immediately after its company presentation in January in Valencia.
Compared to the first generation, the new Jazz has grown in all its parts.
Its length reaches 3.90 meters (five centimeters more), the width 1.69 meters (two centimeters more) and the intersection reaches 2.50 meters, with an increase of five centimeters.
The height, however, remained unchanged at 1.52 meters.
Along with the increase in size, the habitable interior is also expanded.
This advantage arises, on the one hand, from the addition of a new platform, and, on the other hand, from the introduction of the fuel tank in a central position, a solution also adopted in the previous Jazz model.
In addition, the capacity of the luggage compartment – equipped with a double background – rises to 399 liters, or 19 liters more than the capacity of the first generation.
It should be noted that these are the measures of the engine version 1.4, and that the luggage compartment of the Honda Jazz 1.2 is 379 liters.
Other improvements – in addition to external elements such as the rear LEDs or the possibility of mounting the panoramic glass – include improved accessibility to the rear seats.
The doors that allow access to the rear positions, in fact, open at an angle of 80 degrees, compared to the 67 degrees of the first Jazz.
In addition, the engines in this second generation of jazz are also new.
At the time of commercialization, this small model will be offered in models with 1.2 and 1.4 litre gasoline engines.
Both mechanics include i-VTEC technology that reduces fuel consumption, produces less carbon dioxide emissions, optimizes mechanics and at the same timeins high engine torque in all its phases.
The 1.2 litre model offers a power of 90 hp at 6,000 rpm with a maximum torque of 114 Nm at 4,900 rpm.
The propulsion – which in the previous Jazz reached 78 horsepower – uses 5.3 liters of fuel and produces CO2 emissions equivalent to about 125 grams.
Compared to the previous propulsion, which used 83 horsepower in the first generation, there are now 100 available.
The 100 horsepower Jazz 1.4 achieves a combination of 5.4 liters of fuel and 128 grams of CO2 emissions.
Bee Car to Avoid Collisions
As part of the development of accidents prevention technologies, Nissan is inspired by nature, and in particular by bees.
The Japanese company has created a robot that, by taking for example the flight of bees, knows how to avoid accidents.
It is the Bio-mimetic Car Robot Drive, or BR23C, which is the first step towards collision prevention technologies.
The engineers at the Advanced Technical Center at Nissan Motor Co. developed this small robot in collaboration with the Center for Scientific and Technological Research of the prestigious University of Tokyo in Japan.
According to Kazuhiro Doi, Director General of Public Relations for Technology and Brand Management Research and Development, the BR23C is an extension of Nissan’s four-zone Safety Shield.
This robot is intended to improve the ability to prevent collisions in the manufacturer’s vehicles.
During flight, each bee creates its own oval-shaped personal space that is very similar to the Nissan safety shield.
But the most important thing is the composite eyes of bees, able to see in all directions at a angle of more than 300 degrees, and allowing the insect to fly without interruption in its personal space.
To recreate this visual function, the engineers developed what they called a Laser Range Finder.
This mechanism detects obstacles in front of the BR23C within a radius of two meters and with a maximum width of 180 degrees, calculates the distance from the object and sends a signal to an on-board microprocessor that immediately prevents collision.
“As soon as it detects an obstacle, the small robot mimics the movements of a bee and immediately changes direction by turning the wheels at a straight or greater angle to avoid collision.
The most obvious difference with any assisted system is that the escape manoeuvre is entirely instinctive.
"If not, the robot would not be able to react quickly enough to avoid obstacles," says Toshiyuki Andoh, director of the Mobility Laboratory and chief engineer of this project.
Unlike a bee, the robot cannot deviate up or down, and not even diagonally; it can only move in two dimensions and in the direction in which it can spin its wheels and not exploiting endless directions and ways as bees do.
For this reason, Nissan used a rotation function, in addition to acceleration and deceleration, so that the small robot could avoid collisions.
“This device only needs to process information every few seconds, and to act on this data.
It does not require information storage or the intuitive logic of pre-maneuvering, so it can work without interruption and with only a few dozen KB of memory.
This may be surprising, but we’re not talking about gigabytes of memory, or even mega.”
It is the first step towards the development of new technologies for instant collision prevention, a technology that Nissan hopes will be standardized in cars within ten years.
The robot uses lithium polymer batteries, which are lighter and more durable than the lithium-ion type.
Another potential future application of this technology could be the integration of the units with a GPS satellite navigation system to bring the driver to the destination while avoiding obstacles on the road.
Shake before you apply for a loan
We must recognize that the U.S. Treasury Department, in addition to having a lot of capital to intervene, is not lacking in ingenuity.
Faced with the crisis and to prevent Americans from engaging in junk mortgages in dubious bank insolvencies, they created a fun and instructive game for network users: "Bad Credit Hotel".
In other words, the “hotel of bad credit”...or trouble.
The tight appearance of this accommodation and, in particular, its receptionist serves to make you think not one, but two or even three times before applying for a loan.
And, most importantly, where to do it, which is probably the primary goal.
Certainly the information that the game provides is useful, but it is not detailed.
It’s more a website for teenagers than a website for the general public.
What happens when the game is finished?
Well, a songo room appears inside the hotel.
It’s still something, because buying a better home isn’t even talking about...
Morgan Stanley to Open Capital to MUFG
Morgan Stanley has announced the signing of an agreement with Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG), the first bank in Japan, which will invest $9 billion in a 21% stake in the Company, following a sharp decline in its stock market.
A week after the drafting of a provisional agreement, the two banks explained that MUFG would buy 9.9% of Morgan Stanley’s shares at an individual cost of $25.25, or a sum of $3 billion.
The fixed price is 19% lower than the accounting value of the securities as of August 31.
MUFG will also invest $6 billion in the purchase of convertible securities at a $31.25 conversion price, ensuring a 10% return.
Morgan Stanley said the global transaction would be based on an average price of $29 per share, a percentage below its current rate of 28%.
At 5 p.m., the Morgan Stanley stock fell by 6.79% to $23.77.
“This strategic alliance represents an important opportunity to accelerate Morgan Stanley’s transition to a bank holding company,” said John Mack, CEO of the American group.
Morgan Stanley adopted this new statute last week, which should allow it to differentiate its shares while still making them pass under the control of the Federal Reserve.
His alliance with MUFG also confirms how the current financial crisis is forcing the largest names on Wall Street to take a much more cautious stance than previously.
The arrangements set on Monday also show that in recent days the deal has been modified: last Monday, Morgan had simply announced the sale of 20% of its shares to the Japanese giant for a sum of $8.5 billion.
“A week ago, in Tokyo, Toshihide Mizuno, executive director of MUFG, explained: “We thought our stake would be exclusively ordinary shares.
But given the current situation of the world economy and the market, we have chosen to minimize the risks and protect ourselves."
On the basis of the weighted average price, MUFG will obtain Morgan Stanley securities at a price lower than their accounting value of 7%.
And the transaction would result in an investment of at least 20% of the equity on a diluted basis.”
The agreement stipulates that MUFG will be able to convert half of its preferential securities into ordinary shares in one year if, during a given period, the latter are traded more than 50% below the fixed conversion price, or at about $47.
Morgan Stanley assures that the capital contributed by MUFG would enable it to seize investment opportunities, strengthen its budget and increase its liquidity.
A group spokesman, however, declined to provide clarifications about the two new allies’ strategic projects.
After MUFG’s investment, Morgan Stanley is expected to set a Tier One solvency ratio of around 15%, one of the best in the industry.
Morgan said it had "significantly" eased its budget starting at the end of August.
The last few weeks have tested the group, which has seen the value of its shares halve while the cost of insurance against risks has risen.
The cost returned on Monday, but remained at a high level, around 12%.
Last week, Goldman Sachs, the only other “survivor” of Wall Street’s major investment banks after the collapse of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers and the merger of Merrill Lynch, announced it had raised $15 billion, partly from Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway group.
Rafael Correa to Quito on Monday.
To found the republic on a socialism in the 21st century.
This is the joint project of the Venezuelan Hugo Chávez, the Bolivian Evo Morales and the Ecuadorian Rafael Correa.
On Sunday, following the example of colleagues and friends, it was the latter who gave voice to the draft of a new Constitution.
A mission accomplished since, according to official results, 64% of voters voted "yes" in the referendum, on a basis of votes equal to 80%.
According to these results, the “no” was 28%, while 7% of the votes were null and 0.7% white cards.
In order for the draft constitution to be adopted, it needs to get half of the votes, plus one.
On Sunday, two polls conducted at the exit of the polls and an estimate from a non-governmental organization had announced an overwhelming victory of the "yes", placing it between 63% and 70%.
Rafael Correa claimed in the night between Sunday and Monday the victory of his Constitution.
“The Constitution has triumphed gloriously,” he said, congratulating the Ecuadorians in the governorate of Guayaquil, 280 kilometers southwest of Quito.
As always, Chavez and Morales congratulated Rafael Correa, as did his Chilean counterpart Michelle Bachelet.
The poll, which took place calmly according to the election observation mission of the Organization of American States (OAS), was based on a text of 444 points to consolidate the “new socialism” defended by the president.
This draft constitution consecrates the power of the state over the economy, reserving to it the "development planning" of a country that lives essentially from the oil extraction carried out by large foreign companies and consequently their currency.
Concepted by Correa, elected in 2006, the bill also grants more powers to the head of state, who can be elected for two consecutive four-year terms, will have the possibility to dissolve the assembly.
Correa has already announced his intention to take advantage of this amendment and to resume his candidacy for a new term in February 2009.
The Constitution also states the free health and education services, which the president has begun to promote in this country of 13.9 million inhabitants, where 50% of the population lives below the poverty line.
It also prohibits the presence of foreign troops, a provision that will put an end to the agreement between Quito and Washington to use an Ecuadorian base as a starting point for U.S. anti-drug operations.
Thirteen hostages released in Chad
An Egyptian commando has launched an assault on the kidnappers of the eleven tourists and their eight accompanyers seized ten days ago.
I am in Cairo.
The eleven European tourists and their eight Egyptian escorts who were held captive in the desert for ten days were returned to the Egyptian capital on Monday afternoon.
In the morning, they were liberated in Chad by an Egyptian command.
Apparently in shape, the hostages arrived at the Almaza military base near Cairo International Airport around 15:30 a.m. on board a special aircraft.
On board a helicopter, they were immediately transferred, without being able to give any press interviews, to the hospital of Maadi, a residential suburb of Cairo, for analysis.
They enjoy "good health" and no ransom has been paid "to the hijackers," Egyptian Minister of Tourism Zoheir Garanna said on the landing ground.
Kidnapped on September 19 during a 4x4 safari at the foot of Mount Ouanat, bordering Egypt, Sudan and Libya, this group of hostages had been unleashed from one hiding place to another by 35 unknown hijackers.
The group consisted of 11 tourists – five Italians, five Germans and one Romanian – and eight Egyptians: two guides, four drivers, a border guard and the director of Aegyptous, the agency organizing the safari.
An Egyptian security official said 30 special forces members aboard two helicopters had launched the assault during the night, just before dawn.
“There were shots, half of the hijackers were killed, while the others fled,” the official said, asking for anonymity.
He explained that 150 members of the Egyptian special forces of the light unit were sent to Sudan, where they would be supported by German and Italian commandos.
Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini stressed from Belgrade the importance of the role of Italian intelligence agents and special forces.
We must admit that if we achieved this result it was thanks to the professionalism and efficiency of the men of our intelligence services, the special forces," he said, without adding further details.
He also denied the payment of a ransom.
The day before, the Sudanese army’s patrol claimed to have intercepted a 4x4 vehicle with the hijackers on board and killed six, including the Chadese leader of the hijackers, and captured two.
According to the army, the hijackers are linked to a Darfur rebel organization, the Sudan Liberation Movement (SLA_U), a claim immediately dismissed by the latter.
The Silent Majority of Culture
On the front page is a debate on the funding of culture on which the current election campaign is focused.
So much better.
But a part of our cultural life is always in the shadow.
Who will speak out to denounce the miserable sums granted to small museums, archives, archaeological excavations or national historical sites that starve?
Which politician will dare to remind the federal government that it is neglecting monuments and heritage buildings?
That in Quebec, like in Canada, we do not have real laws that effectively preserve our heritage?
Did you know that the French government pays three and a half million euros for the restoration of Chinon Castle in the Loire Valley alone?
With our American neighbors, it is the Constitution that states that the protection of heritage is part of the national culture and that the same heritage must be protected by every citizen, every political authority and every government department, and all this by mutual agreement.
In Québec, at the Federation of Historical Societies of Québec, there are at least 40,000 volunteers who, grouped into 211 societies for the protection of historical, genealogy, archives and property, preserve, with four money, private archives and archaeological sites.
They are the ones who often defend our heritage, who protest with the energy of despair when real estate entrepreneurs and decision-makers attack our forgotten remains and cemeteries with their bulldozers.
When will the right space be reserved for history and heritage?
Benelux governments nationalize part of Fortis bank
The Benelux countries are helping through partial nationalization the Belgian-Dutch bank Fortis, which ended up in trouble for the first time in Europe due to the US credit market crisis: the three nations will provide €11.2 billion to the financial institution - insurance with interest in Hungary as well.
The governments of Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands agreed at the highest level this weekend, including the President of the European Central Bank and the European Commissioner for Competition.
In the euro area, the first major crisis in the context of the difficulties in which the international financial market has been debated for more than a year is that of the bank Fortis, and from a certain point of view the decisions taken in this regard can constitute a precedent.
According to the decision, all three states will hold almost half (49%) of the bank’s stake in the country.
The bank will almost sell part of its interests, including first of all the assets, especially insurance, of Dutch ABN Amro acquired a year ago.
Last week, Fortis’ shares had started with a vertical collapse, and serious signals of the institution’s crisis had appeared later in the second half of the week.
Analysts, however, agree that the bank, with 85,000 employees, is too large to allow it to go bankrupt.
The bank’s shares fell 12 percent on Friday, the lowest point in 14 years.
Since January, the value of the shares has fallen by more than two-thirds.
Considering the current price of the shares, the total capital value of the group is around 14 billion euros, but according to the bank’s executives this value is not real.
The summit attributes the fall of Fortis shares to the uncertainties of the non-European market due to the acceptance of the US $700 billion plan.
On Monday, the price slowly went up.
On Friday, Filip Dierckx was appointed new CEO of the bank.
The financial institution has also sought private buyers but so far no one has come up with a worthy offer.
The Belgian government had already assured investors that they should not be afraid of losing money.
There was no panic among the customers of the bank, the branches were not attacked.
In Hungary, Fortis owns autonomous subsidiaries and has also acquired leasing companies.
The fox in the chicken
In America, life and health insurance companies, according to people’s drug purchase data, often refuse to sign an insurance contract.
Privacy experts fear that the data market will become uncontrollable.
"There is a privacy program according to which the use of prescription drug data depends in any case on the approval of the person concerned.
This program must be in independent hands, otherwise it is like entrusting the chicken to the fox,” writes the Washington Post citing Richard Dick, the author of the program to follow prescriptions for medicines.
The insurance companies subordinate the insurance fee and the amount due in case of accidents to the health of the potential client and if they consider the risk too high they do not contract insurance.
A long time ago the client had to undergo a medical examination and the contract was concluded only after the outcome of the examination.
Dick 10 years ago invented a much cheaper procedure: according to the customer's identification code you can easily get information from the pharmacies about which medicines he bought in the last year and a half and from this the program shows which diseases he suffers and in what health condition he is.
For example, if you regularly buy large amounts of cholesterol reducers, this means that your blood fat level is practically inexorably high and is classified in the highest risk category.
There are various versions of the program in the market, some also determine the risk multiplier, so in addition to paperwork, there is not much left, even if there are minor difficulties.
Some medicines can be used for multiple purposes, e.g. some compounds can be used against migraines or heat outbursts, but they are also effective against depression.
The latter, from the insurance-commercial point of view, is valid as an increasing risk factor, the first two not.
For the request and processing of data, separate companies have been formed and these, before obtaining the necessary information from the pharmacies, ask for the approval of the patient.
Now the authorities are forcing them to do so even though they have not so far imposed fines for negligence.
Some companies have also recently processed the results of laboratory tests and linked them to medicine consumption data to provide a more accurate picture of the patient’s health status.
More and more companies have access to data and parallel control of use will be increasingly difficult.
There is a separate privacy law but its validity extends only to health services and insurance.
In front of Congress there is a bill that gives authorities the power to oversee companies specializing in data service.
Richard Dick admits that it is not enough: that is why he developed a program that connects data transmission with the express approval of the person concerned.
Another issue is that the person concerned can not so much deny approval because otherwise the insurers will not conclude the contract.
So then in the end the chickens are entrusted to the mercy of the fox.
The global menu
EU and India double trade
Since the European Union and India are mainly trade partners with each other, the agenda of the ninth summit has also been dominated by this topic, as well as all other global issues.
Today there will be a Franco-Indian summit that will primarily address cooperation on nuclear energy.
The European Union recognizes the fact that India is becoming a major democratic power to which more voice should be given in international affairs, but member countries have yet to decide whether or not to support New Delhi as a permanent member of the UN Security Council.
Therefore, this issue was not insisted on at the ninth summit held yesterday in Marseille.
French President Nicolas Sarkozy, as turning President of the Union, José Manuel Barroso, President of the Commission, and Javier Solana, High Representative for Foreign Affairs, met with Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, with whom they agreed to double in 5 years, i.e. increase to 100 billion euros, trade.
Given that between 2000 and 2007 the trade in goods rose from 25 billion to 55 billion, this is not an ambitious goal.
As a result, they have legally unified the 26 bilateral civil flight agreements, so that air traffic can also take off in the future.
India wants to sign a free trade agreement with the EU by the end of 2009.
Sarkozy has promised to accelerate the deal.
The goal is to balance because while the EU is India’s largest trading partner, New Delhi is only ninth among EU partners.
The summit focused on global issues.
To the situation in Afghanistan and Pakistan and to terrorism, the latter condemned in all its forms by both sides, and urged the convening of a UN conference.
They urged the conclusion of the Doha Round trade, even though both sides had a role in the failure of this.
The EU has confirmed its commitment to the energy and climate agenda, which is to reduce emissions of harmful substances by at least 20% by 2020.
India is also in agreement on this, as well as on the fact that a global pact should be signed at the climate conference scheduled for next year and cut greenhouse gas production by 50% by 2050.
They also want to curb the rise in food prices and have supported the convening of an international meeting to examine the financial crisis.
The Prime Minister of India will visit the French capital today, where he is preparing for a bilateral meeting to sign a treaty on the peaceful use of nuclear energy.
In Paris, it is hoped that for the construction of the Indian nuclear reactors the French companies will receive a contract worth 20 billion euros.
According to our news agency, the agreement would last 15 years.
More than 300 Italian publishers
Italian publishers attended the Frankfurt International Book Fair.
More than 300 Italian publishers will be present at the 60th edition of the Book Fair, the most important international event for the exchange of rights.
The Frankfurt International Book Fair awaits more than 7,000 exhibitors from 101 different countries that will occupy the 171,790 square meters of the Fair with more than 403,000 titles on display and with Turkey as an honorary host.
It will be the Deputy Secretary at the Ministry for Cultural Property and Activities Francesco Maria Giro to represent the Italian Government at the inauguration ceremony of the Italian Pavilion: Italy will be actually present institutionally with a Punto Italia - 264 square meters of exhibition space.
It will be followed by the press meeting at the Room Struktur in the 5.0 pavilion of the Buchmesse: this will be the opportunity to present figures, trends and perspectives on the state of publishing in Italy.
According to the data progressively decreases the weight of books by foreign authors on the total Italian production, and in particular on that for adults and children.
Billionaire Steve Fossett's plane found missing a year ago
Steve Fossett, the billionaire who disappeared on September 3, 2007 while flying over the Nevada desert, has been found.
The remains were found on a plateau at 3,000 meters in the Sierra Nevada area of Mammoth Lakes, on the border between California and Nevada.
There were no human remains inside the plane.
Madera County Sheriff John Anderson said: "The plane was localized, we sent a team, and now we have confirmation that it's exactly what Steve Fossett was flying on the day he disappeared," he said in a news conference.
The sheriff then said that no human remains were found either in the plane or in the surrounding area.
The 63-year-old billionaire was found dead in February.
The U.S. Transportation Safety Office (NTSB) said that a team of investigators was sent a few hours after the detection of the debris, which then identified the device: it is exactly the Bellanca 8kcab, disappeared since September 3, 2007, when Fossett took off from Yerington in Nevada for a three-hour flight.
Yesterday, still in California, not far from the Nevada border, some of Fossett’s personal items had been found by a couple near their Mammoth Lakes home.
These are two documents named Fossett, both issued by the Illinois Federal Aviation Administration, cash and a fold.
Fossett's search was stopped a month after his disappearance.
The billionaire had won a place in history thanks to a long series of primates.
In 2002, on the sixth attempt, he became the first man to complete the round of the world on an aerostatic balloon: two weeks of solo flight.
Three years later he had made the world round in a plane and without a stop.
Among his many records is that of flying at 15,445 meters above the Andes, but with a co-pilot.
Glk, the advertisement you don’t expect
A SUV out of the patterns with an original design and well defined by firm lines, wide surfaces and net angles.
It is this, in summary, Glk the last born among the offroad "compact" of the house of the star with which Mercedes-Benz has sought to give a venture of novelty in this sector.
Just for its content beyond the traditional canons, will be unexpected and unconventional also the communication that will accompany the launch of the Suv Glk, available at the Mercedes-Benz showrooms from the next 17 October.
Thus, the advertising battage that will accompany the debut of the new car will initiate an unprecedented mode of communication also through an adventurous 3D affixing campaign, used for the first time in Italy by an automotive brand.
A project of maxi-affixings, articulated in three different phases, that will dominate the central street of Milan’s shopping, Corso Como, until November 15.
The first phase of this new type of communication will begin with the presentation of the car in stereoscopic vision and thanks to special glasses distributed near Corso Como it will be possible to see the new SUV in almost real size and in three-dimensional format.
In fact, looking at the image you will have the impression that the car is out of the manifesto.
Subsequently, through the use of the innovative Elumina8 technology, the new Glk will be illuminated at different times in all its details, and then reconstituted into a single image.
Undoubtedly, Mercedes with this advertisement is trying to introduce something new in the stereotyped field of automotive communication.
Will it succeed with this formula to stumble the interest of future buyers?
This is the Italian hooligan.
Through the triangle, they risk the triangle.
In addition, it is important to note that the use of the product is not limited to the use of the product or the use of the product.
He had never met his opponents.
The extraction of the group is on the right.
The promoters come from Triveneto.
From Verona, Padova, Trieste and Udine.
To these in Sofia were added grouppools (a few units, in fact) from Campania and Puglia.
They have tricolor flags where the cities of origin of the militants appear: Saturday night they were taken away for not to be identified.
They are inspired by English fans.
In Bulgaria they found a fancy of real Nazis, that of Levski.
The FIGC had made available to Italian fans 144 tickets for the match: all nominative, so easily controllable.
And the Viminale had in fact checked them all: among those departing for Sofia there was nobody with a Daspo running, nobody who had been inhibited from attending a stadium.
For example, if you are not able to do this, you will be able to do so without having to do so.
Now the Viminale waits to read the documents that will come from the Bulgarian police then will take action: in this case, it is possible to give the Daspo for five years at least to the fans who have been arrested or who have been identified in the riots.
A international Daspo that prevents you from attending not only the Italian stadiums but all over Europe.
Our hooligans, in short, will no longer set foot in a stadium.
and fortunately.
But now there is the fear-emulation: that is, that to those little more than a hundred and fifty, others are added.
“We must immediately extinguish this fire and not legitimize those who behave in this way,” they say.
“We’re looking forward to the match, especially on Wednesday in Lecce.
In fact, in Puglia there is a small nucleus of supporters of Ultras Italia.
In the first half of the year, the European Union and the European Union have adopted a new regulation on the protection of foodstuffs and foodstuffs.
"The Duce-Duce choirs and the stretched arm during the hymn of Mameli?
This is the thought (expressed in a really unhappy way) of Domenico Mazzilli, for a few weeks director of the Observatorio del Viminale (he took the place that was first of Francesco Tagliente and then of Felice Ferlizzi).
Mazzilli had previously been quarterback of Trieste where there is a core of supporters of the group Ultras Italy, founded in 2002.
It is true, as Mazzilli says, that in Bulgaria it is not a crime to spoil the Duce but the behavior of those 150-200 fans was shameful.
“I’m not a sociologist – adds the Observatory’s No. 1 – the crimes must be attributed to the country where the fact occurs.
So far this group had remained in line, now we will see well what happened and we will evaluate for the future.
But let’s also talk about the hymn of Mameli: even those are not a crime, but if you allow me, they are not education...”
