A social card of a resident of Ivanovo Oblast is recognized as an electronic means of payment.
The changes provide for the retention of travel privileges in public passenger transport.
From September 24, the procedure for arranging preferential travel for citizens using a social card of a resident of Ivanovo Oblast will be changed.
As reported by the press service of the Government of Russia in Ivanovo Region, the changes provide for the retention of privileges for travel on public passenger transport and bring the settlement scheme on the social card into line with the requirements of Federal Law No. 161 of the Federal Law "On the National Payment System."
Moreover, a social card of a resident of Ivanovo Oblast is recognized as an electronic means of payment.
Consequently, the conditions for its application change.
Thus, the replenishment limit is now set not on trips, as before, but in the amount of money, with the preservation of winter and summer periods - in winter no more than 400 roubles, in summer - no more than 800 roubles for the current month.
Now holders of a social card on transport receipts will need to track not the number of remaining trips, but the balance of funds.
The cost of preferential travel for citizens will amount to 1 / 2 of the fare of the carrier.
The remaining half of the fare is reimbursed by the regional budget.
The schedule for replenishing the social card with money remains the same - in the period from the 24th of the previous month to the 23rd of the current month.
The new order of travel on the social card will have a number of advantages.
Thus, it becomes possible to keep detailed records of spending of funds on a social card with accuracy to the point of kopecks.
In addition, it is possible to return credits but unspent funds.
It should also be added that the settlement scheme with carriers becomes transparent, as now half of the fare is paid by a citizen, and the same amount is reimbursed to the carrier by the budget.
No fees will be charged when depositing funds on the card.
In turn, Vasily Silkin, Deputy Head of the Department of Roads and Transport of Ivanovo Region, reported that in 2014, more than 33 million trips were made in the region using the social card, in 2015 - almost 25 million trips.
More than 470 million roubles have been allocated in the regional budget for the provision of preferential travel for citizens using a social card.
As of September 1, the amount of compensation for these purposes amounted to more than 312 million roubles.
Teacher confesses to killing girlfriend during 911 call
In a near-trembling 911 call, college teacher Shannon Lamb told police that he shot his girlfriend and that officers were needed to arrive at their home.
Lamb stressed that there was a "dog" in the house who was alive but probably upset, and said contact from the victim's family could be found on her phone.
Inside the home, police found Amy Prentice's body and a handwritten note carelessly written on a white sheet of linen paper: "I'm very sorry, I wish I could take everything back, I loved Amy and she is the only woman who has ever loved me," the note said, according to authorities signed by Lamb.
There was no indication that Lamb, who ran two online courses at Delta State University in Cleveland, Mississippi, had by then traveled 300 miles to campus, where police believe he shot and killed respected history teacher Ethan Schmidt on his doorstep.
Delta State University Police Chief Lynne Buford said university officials learned of the shooting at 10: 18 a.m.
He said Lamb made that truthful 911 call soon after.
By the end of the day, the death toll will be one more: Lamb committed suicide as soon as police surrounded him.
The day after the shooting at the school forced students and faculty to hide behind locked doors, officials were still trying to piece together Lamb's motives.
Information shared by investigators at both ends of the state, as well as students and staff who knew him, helped paint a picture of a talented but possibly troubled teacher.
Students said they were looking forward to his classes.
Police in Gautier, where Prentice died, said he had no violence or criminal record.
Schmidt himself included Lamb in a book he wrote in which he paid tribute to the "wonderful people" with whom he intersected in his teaching life.
Both taught at the Faculty of Social Sciences and History, which has 17 faculty members, and many students attended lectures on both.
At the same time, there were some prerequisites for problems to arise.
One student who spoke well of Lamb, Brandon Beavers, said he also seemed anxious and nervous, "as if there was something wrong with him."
Another student, Michael Sykes, said Lamb told him at the end of the 2014-15 school year how he had struggled with stress.
Lamb had earlier asked Delta State University to grant him sick leave, saying he had some health problems.
This year, he taught only two online courses.
Recent changes to university hiring rules meant that the doctorate Lamb had worked so hard to obtain would not automatically guarantee him a teaching position.
University President William LaForge said he was not aware of the Lamb-Schmidt conflict, but "obviously Mr. Lamb had something on his mind."
These are questions that Lamb will no longer be able to answer.
Police raided Lamb's trail after he fled campus on his way back to Mississippi from Arkansas.
Before he could be arrested, Lamb shot himself with a .38-caliber handgun in the backyard of a home one mile south of his parents' home in suburban Greenville, Mississippi, Washington County Coroner Methel Johnson said.
His car, with the engine running, was still parked on the driveway.
It was not immediately clear why Lamb came to the house, though Johnson said she believed he knew the occupants.
Lamb grew up in those parts.
Lamb began working at the university, which has 3,500 students in a city of about 12,000, in 2009 and taught geography and pedagogy.
He received his doctorate in education in the spring of the same year.
One of Lamb's long-time friends described him as intelligent, charismatic and fun-loving.
Carla Hairston said she was 15 and Lamb 20 when they met through mutual friends.
She and her friends were in high school and he was a cool older guy who had been trying to teach her how to play the guitar for a few years.
In those years, it was popular with women.
All the girls melted when he was around, "said Hairston, now 40 and who lives in Jackson, a suburb of Brandon.
Lamb and Prentice had apparently been dating for some time.
In a 911 call, Lamb said, "I killed my wife," but there is no record of their marriage.
The couple had a dog named Lightning, who lived with them in Gautier in a brick house that overlooks the canal.
According to police, the dog is fine.
Prentice's ex-husband, Sean O'Steen, said they divorced 15 years ago but remained friends, and that they have a daughter who is now 19.
"She's absolutely gutted," O'Steen said of her daughter.
She and her mother were good friends.
O'Steen said he had not met Lamb, but heard from his daughter Abigail that Lamb was interested in music and played the blues.
Lamb met Prentice when he and Abigail both performed at the same summer festival three years ago.
Then they played together at concerts from time to time.
O'Steen said his daughter writes music and sings.
Prentice was a nurse and worked online for various companies.
Mike Shaffer, a bartender and part-time entertainment coordinator at the dimly lit The Julep Room bar in the suburb of Gautier, said the last time he saw Lamb and Prentice was on the evening of September 5, when Lamb finished playing guitar and harmonica for a small crowd.
There was nothing suspicious.
"Just a happy couple," he said.
We were having fun and making fun of each other.
In the sense that they were both very witty.
Schmidt, the deceased teacher, led seminars for freshmen and specialized in Native American and colonial American history, said Don Allan Mitchell, an English teacher at the same school.
He was married and had three young children.
He studied at Kansas State University in Emporia and was president of the student fraternity and student self-government.
At the Delta State University campus in Cleveland on Tuesday evening, about 900 people, including university faculty, staff, students and community members, participated in a candlelit memorial ceremony.
Schmidt's wife, Liz, and brother, Jeff Schmidt, also attended the ceremony, during which the university choir sang Bright Morning Star and Amazing Grace.
Classes will resume on Wednesday.
"We're trying to get our students back," LaForge said.
The crisis is over.
Today is recovery day.
Amy and Rogelio Solis reported from Cleveland, Mississippi.
Associated Press writers Emily Wagster Pettus in Greenville, Mississippi, and Rebecca Santana in New Orleans contributed to this report.
The material was redacted because police said Lamb's 911 call came after Schmidt was killed, and because while Lamb referred to Prentice as his wife when he called 911, the information that they were married was not confirmed.
Toys R Us plans to hire fewer staff for holiday season
Toys R Us says it will not hire as many staff for the holiday season as it did last year, with the toy and children's retailer saying it will give full-time and part-time staff the opportunity to work more hours.
The company said it plans to hire 40,000 people to work at stores and wholesale bases across the country, down from 45,000 hired for the 2014 holiday season.
Most jobs will be part-time.
The company said it will begin interviewing applicants this month and will build up staff from October to December.
Although the holidays are still a few months away, the shopping season is getting closer, and companies are preparing to hire temporary employees in order to have enough staff in stores to sell, ship, and deliver goods.
Michael J. Fox jokes about 'date' with Princess Diana
The premiere of Back to the Future turned out to be a great event for Michael J. Fox.
It was also remarkable for personal reasons.
"We were sitting in the cinema waiting for the royal family to arrive, I noticed that the seat next to me was empty and then I realised Princess Diana was going to sit next to me," he said in the trailer for the soon-to-be-released documentary Back in Time.
As the film begins, it dawns on me that I am literally at arm's length and one false yawn away from a date with the Princess of Wales.
Back in Time, a documentary about Back to the Future, includes interviews with Fox, Leah Thompson and Christopher Lloyd, as well as director Robert Zemeckis and executive producer Steven Spielberg.
"Back to the Future" premiered 30 years ago.
"For me," Spielberg says, "this is unquestionably the greatest time travel movie ever made."
"Back in Time" will be available on VOD, DVD and in selected theaters in October.
UN chief says there is no military solution in Syria
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon says in response to Russia's military support for Syria that there is "no military solution" to the nearly five-year-old conflict, and that an increase in armaments will only exacerbate the violence and suffering for millions of people.
The UN chief again called on all participants, including the divided UN Security Council, to unite and support inclusive negotiations to find a political solution.
Ban said at a news conference Wednesday that he plans to meet with the foreign ministers of the five permanent members of the council - the United States, Russia, China, the United Kingdom and France - during this month's ministerial session of the General Assembly to discuss Syria.
He lamented that divisions within the council, as well as among Syrians and local authorities, had "made the situation intractable."
Ban called on the five permanent members to show the same solidarity and unity that they had shown in dealing with Iran's nuclear program and the Syrian crisis.
8 Polls That Show Donald Trump Is Not Joking
Some have tried to label him a provocateur.
Others dismissed it as a joke.
And some demand scandal.
But no matter how hard some Republicans try to shake Donald Trump's lead in the polls, they have failed (so far).
Ten of the last 11 national polls have given Donald Trump a double-digit lead, and some are beginning to ask seriously what that means for the real estate mogul's chances of winning the nomination.
Of course, this is just the beginning of the election cycle.
None of this means that Trump has a chance of winning the Republican nomination.
Experts point out that at this time in 2011, Rick Perry was trailing the increasingly popular Herman Kaine, neither of whom had won a single state in the nominating process.
And there are many reasons why he would struggle in a general election.
But outside groups such as Jeb Bush's Supercommittee of Political Activism and the economic conservative Club for Growth recognize Trump's unrelenting strength and are pulling their dollars to topple him.
Here are some poll numbers that suggest that the real estate mogul is more than just an intermediate phase:
Trump's approval ratings have turned 180 degrees.
Just before Donald Trump announced his candidacy in mid-June, a Monmouth University poll showed that only two out of 10 Republicans had a favorable view of the real estate mogul.
By mid-July, it was 40 percent.
At the beginning of August, it was 52 percent.
Six in 10 Republicans now view Donald Trump favorably.
About three in 10 say they have a negative opinion.
And all of these indicators prevail in the early stages.
A Quinnipiac poll in Iowa last week found that 60 percent of Republicans there viewed Trump favorably.
Two-thirds of GOP voters would approve of Trump as their candidate.
In a CNN / ORC poll last week, 67 percent of Republicans said they would either be "ecstatic" or "pleased" if Trump became the nominee.
Only two in 10 say they would be "upset" if he became a candidate.
Only Ben Carson generates about the same level of enthusiasm as Trump (43 percent say they would be "ecstatic" compared to 40 percent who say the same about Trump).
Next in line for the top job?
Marco Rubio, who has just 21 percent.
On the other hand, 47 percent of Republicans say they would be "dissatisfied" or "upset" if establishment favorite Jeb Bush becomes the nominee.
Most Republicans do not see Trump's temperament as a problem.
While Trump has been widely criticized for his braggadocio and insults, 52 percent of Republican-leaning voters across the country think the mogul has the right temperament to be president, according to an ABC News / Washington Post poll conducted Monday.
The same number appears at the nation's first closed-door caucus in Iowa, where the same 52 percent of Republicans think he is the right man to be commander-in-chief, according to Quinnipiac last week.
Still, 44 percent think he is not the right man for the job, and nearly six in 10 independent voters say his temperament is not suited to the White House, according to ABC / Post reports.
Republican voters are getting used to that thought.
When they put their hats on, Republican voters think Trump is serious.
When asked who is the most likely winner of the GOP nomination, four in 10 said Trump was the favorite, according to a CNN / ORC poll last week.
That was no longer the case when four out of 10 bet on Jeb Bush at the end of July.
Full disclosure: GOP voters didn't have the right magic crystal ball before.
At the same time, in the last cycle, four out of 10 Republicans chose Rick Perry as the most likely candidate, while only 28 percent supported eventual nominee Mitt Romney.
Still, it shows that many GOP voters find Trump's campaign compelling.
Even if Republicans were to rally around another candidate, Trump would still be ahead of everyone else.
Some pundits point out that this spread is likely to play into Trump's advantage, while those who do not support Trump are evenly distributed among those who support more than a dozen other candidates.
But a Monmouth University poll in early September shows that in a hypothetical one-on-one contest between Trump and most other Republican candidates, Trump almost always gets majority support.
He leads Carly Fiorina by 13 points, Marco Rubio by 14 points, Walker by 15 points, Jeb Bush by 19 points and, finally, Rand Paul, John Kasich and Chris Christie by 33 points.
He has a tie with Ted Cruz.
The only candidate to beat him?
Ben Carson beat the businessman by as much as 19 points in a hypothetical one-on-one contest.
Just over half of Donald Trump's supporters say they have changed their minds.
A new CBS / NYT poll conducted Tuesday shows that only more than half of voters who support Trump say they are confident in their votes.
Obviously, a lot can happen and change things, and no one can really say that they will never change their mind.
46 percent say they leave the door open to other candidates.
Still, Trump's most intense competition so far is with fellow outsider neurosurgeon Ben Carson, but voters who say they have changed their minds are more likely to choose Trump.
Six in 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration.
Since Donald Trump called immigrants from Mexico "rapists" in his campaign-opening speech two months ago, the topic of immigration has been at the top of the conversation in 2016.
Some worry that Trump's posturing will alienate key Latino voters from the Republican Party and impede rebranding.
But according to an ABC / Post poll conducted Monday, six out of 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration.
So, as long as immigration attracts widespread attention, it seems likely that Donald Trump will remain in the same position.
Frustration with the government is mounting.
Donald Trump and Ben Carson now count on the support of roughly half of Republican voters, largely because of their outsider status.
Six out of 10 Republicans in Monday's new ABC / Post poll say they would rather want a political outsider than someone with experience in government.
And they, too, are offended by Washington.
A Des Moines Register / Bloomberg poll in Iowa conducted two weeks ago shows that three out of four Iowa Republicans are dissatisfied with Republicans in Congress, with 54 percent "dissatisfied" and 21 percent "furious."
The government will decide the fate of pension indexation in October.
Deputy Prime Minister of the Russian Federation, Olga Golodets, said that the government is now looking for options to implement the law on indexation of pensions in 2016 to the real inflation rate, RG reports.
She noted that a solution should be found by October 8, when the draft budget for next year is submitted to the government.
In addition, the Cabinet is discussing the option of prolonging the decision to freeze the cumulative pension of Russians.
Golodets noted that the amount of pension savings is 350 billion roubles.
The full indexation of pensions for the next year costs about the same.
According to the Deputy Prime Minister, there is no final decision yet on who should pay contributions for non-working citizens.
Golodets believes that if a person does not work on his or her own initiative and does not belong to socially unprotected categories of citizens, it is not entirely fair what society pays for him or her.
Earlier, the media reported that the cabinet is considering two options for balancing the state budget.
Why are eyelids often irritated and blushed?
The ophthalmologist Tatiana Levashova answers:
Our eyelids are screens that protect the eyeball from the many small particles that settle on them.
By forgetting to clean our eyelids regularly, we often contribute to blepharitis ourselves.
The solution is simple:
do not wipe your eyes with dirty hands, carry a special wet eyelid cloth with you;
Clean the edges of the eyelids at least 1-2 times a day from harmful substances accumulated in them during the day.
Cleaning procedures should also be complemented by warm compresses with medicinal herbs (sage, chamomile), which lighten the thick sebaceous glands secret, and then by massaging the edges of the eyelids, which should be carried out in circular movements of the finger pads;
When washing away make-up, do not use alcohol-containing products.
They dry and dehydrate the skin and further thicken the sebaceous secretion.
Pyongyang claims that Korean nuclear scientists have developed an atomic warhead.
North Korean authorities said the country's main nuclear reactor, the Yongbyon nuclear complex, was operating at "full capacity."
The announcement appeared on the website of the country's Central Telegraph Agency.
It notes that the DPRK is ready at any time to respond to the "aggression and nuclear threat of the US," and that the country has improved its nuclear weapons "both in quantity and quality."
The North Korean authorities last tested a nuclear weapon in 2013.
At the same time, no plans to resume full operation of the reactor have been reported since then.
Pyongyang claims to have managed to build an atomic warhead.
North Korea has also repeatedly tested medium- and short-range missiles, polit.ru.
Zhirinovsky demanded that the reference to brotherly peoples be removed from the Russian anthem.
LDPR leader Vladimir Zhirinovsky believes that the reference to the union of fraternal nations should be removed from the national anthem.
He said this during a meeting of the State Duma, reports "Russian News Service."
Who are these people now?
Fascists and murderers!
"It's a very long anthem, the longest in the world, even the athletes can't stand it," Zhirinovsky said.
The deputy believes that it is necessary to remove all the quaternary, which contains this line:
In the summer of 2014, Zhirinovsky said that the current anthem should be changed to "God preserve the tsar," and the Russian tricolor replaced with an imperial flag, polit.ru.
Assad called on all forces to unite in the fight against terrorism.
Syrian President Bashar al-Assad has called on all forces to unite in the fight against terrorism.
Assad believes that if Europe wants to deal with the refugee problem, it must stop supporting terrorists in the Middle East.
The question is not whether Europe accepts refugees or not, but whether the root causes of the problem need to be addressed.
If Europeans care about refugees, let them stop supporting terrorists.
This is our opinion on this issue.
"This is the essence of the refugee issue," he told RT.
We must continue the dialogue in order to reach consensus.
But, if real progress is to be made, it will not be possible as long as people die, as long as the bloodshed continues, and as long as people do not feel safe.
"So we can reach a consensus, but we cannot implement anything until we defeat terrorism in Syria," Assad said.
Recall that about 500 thousand migrants arrived in the EU countries this year, including those from Syria.
The European Commission has said that the current migration crisis in the world is the largest since World War II.
It is possible that thousands of fighters of the Islamic State extremist group may be among the migrants arriving in Europe.
Members of a terrorist organization banned in Russia can use the situation to establish cells in the EU to carry out terrorist activities.
Residents of the German city held a party for refugees.
Over the past month, Germany has taken the lead in accepting refugees, though it has recently tightened border controls to stem the influx.
Authorities estimate that about 800,000 migrants will arrive in Germany by the end of this year, though some experts say the numbers are much higher.
Since the beginning of September, more than 90,000 refugees have already arrived in the country.
BBC correspondent Jenny Hill visited the city of Darmstadt, where migrants are very welcome.
Jeremy Corbyn makes his debut in Prime Minister's Questions
After Mr Corbyn's election, his debut at Prime Minister's Questions is eagerly anticipated
New Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn is set to make his first appearance at Prime Minister's Questions for the first time in a showdown with David Cameron.
Mr Corbyn will address the first of six questions in the afternoon and is likely to be closely watched by the press and Labour MPs.
He made a plea for "less theatre and more facts" in a weekly demonstration speech.
He also said he might miss some meetings, leaving them to his colleagues.
The meeting will be Mr Corbyn's first parliamentary test as leader, following his appointment of a shadow cabinet and his speech to the annual Trades Union Congress on Tuesday.
Meanwhile, the Labour leader's decision to stand in silence during the national anthem at a service on Tuesday to mark the 75th anniversary of the Battle of Britain has drawn criticism from a number of Conservative MPs and been the subject of several newspaper front pages.
Mr Corbyn's decision not to sing the national anthem has attracted attention
Mr Corbyn's spokesman said he had "stood in respectful silence" and acknowledged the "heroism of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of Britain."
But Mr Corbyn's shadow cabinet member Owen Smith told Newsnight on BBC 2 that he would advise the Labour leader to sing the national anthem "regardless" of his belief in abolishing the monarchy.
Nearly a dozen shadow ministers refused to play Mr Corbyn's team, voicing disagreements on the economy, defence and foreign policy, while less than one-sixth of the parliamentary party's members backed him as leader.
BBC political correspondent Robin Brant says political divisions are also "piling up" in the Labour party following Mr Corbyn's appointment to the European Union and the government's cap on compensation payments.
Mr Corbyn told the Trades Union Conference that Labour had tabled amendments aimed at abolishing the whole idea of restrictions.
Hours later, Mr Smith, the shadow work and pensions secretary, said there was "absolute clarity" within the party that it was opposed only to the government's plans to cut the cap from £26,000 to £23,000.
Mr Corbyn will become the fifth Labour leader David Cameron will meet at the despatch box in the decade since he became Conservative leader.
The Labour leader, who has promised a different approach to politics, says he has "mobilised collective resources" to gather ideas for Mr Cameron's questions and has received more than 30,000 proposals.
The MP for Islington North said the Prime Minister's questions were too confrontational and he would refrain from witty answers and quips, instead promising to focus on serious issues such as poverty, inequality and the problems facing young people.
Mr Corbyn said Angela Eagle, the shadow economy secretary, would replace him at Prime Minister's Questions when he is away - for example when Mr Cameron is abroad.
He also floated the idea of allowing other colleagues to take the floor if possible, saying he had approached the Speaker of the House of Commons, John Bercow, to discuss the issue.
After becoming leader in 2005, Mr Cameron said he wanted to move away from the "fair-weather" political style often associated with Prime Minister's Questions, but admitted a few years later that he had failed.
Since it first aired in 1990, Prime Minister's Questions has become a key indicator of a leader's views, his ability to run the House of Commons, and the reputation of other MPs, though critics say it has become a caricature and requires far-reaching reforms.
"Taken in Joburg" Homeless young people trained as photographers

Pound rises as UK wages rise
The pound rose as wages rose in the UK, with the FTSE 100 index rising on the back of the bid to buy SABMiller.
Between May and June, earnings in the UK, excluding bonuses, rose 2.9% year-on-year.
The rate of growth was the fastest since 2009, and was greeted as an early rescheduling of forecasts for possible price increases.
The pound rose more than 1% against the dollar to $1.5505, and 0.84% against the euro to €1.3730.
The FTSE 100 rose 1.49% to 6,229.21.
SABMiller shares stood out, rising 20% thanks to a takeover offer from rival AB InBev.
The deal would bring together the world's two largest brewing companies, bringing together brands such as Budweiser, Stella Artois, Peroni and Grolsch.
Burberry shares rose 0.9% on encouraging news from rival luxury goods group Richemont.
The latest sales figures from Richemont beat expectations and showed that sales in China - a key market for Burberry - have started to rise again.
Glencore shares rose 5% after the mining giant said it had raised $2.5 billion through a share offering as part of a debt-reduction strategy.
Shares in paper and packaging group Mondi led the decline in the index - down 4.3% - after Goldman Sachs downgraded the group to "sell."
Shares in JD Sports rose after the sportswear supplier reported an 83 per cent rise in half-year pre-tax profits to £46.6million.
JD Sports boss says higher wages could hamper expansion
JD Sports chief executive Peter Cowgill says raising the minimum wage for UK workers means "more purchasing power in the pockets of potential consumers."
But such purchasing power is unlikely to outweigh the increase in labor costs, he said.
Costs could affect plans to expand JD Sports, he added, which could mean fewer additional vacancies.
Metcash launches bottom-up campaign to combat Aldi onslaught
Metcash is trying to protect its IGA stores from the onslaught of Aldi in South Australia and Western Australia.
A bottom-up food wholesaler has launched a campaign to protect the market share of IGA retailers in South Australia and Western Australia in light of Aldi's upcoming $700 million infusion.
As Aldi prepares to open two wholesale warehouses and the first of 120 stores in South and Western Australia early next year, supermarkets Metcash and IGA are strengthening relationships with local food suppliers and promoting the IGA brand through marketing in leading media and social media and at events such as the Adelaide Show.
The campaign is being joined by retailers and IGA suppliers such as Dunsborough-based ice cream maker Simmo's, which offers tasting in IGA stores, and shop owners who sell discounted tickets to South Australian Football League matches to regular customers.
Metcash is expected to reveal more details of its protection strategy on September 29 - the day the wholesaler of food, spirits and household goods will hold its annual Investor Strategy Day.
Much is at stake, with IGA-branded stores in South Australia and Western Australia accounting for almost 30% of all Metcash stores and showing higher margins than the Metcash IGA chain in the eastern states.
Shoppers in South and Western Australia are known to follow familiar routes, so the market is more favorable for IGA retailers than in New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland - more than 30 per cent in SA and 24 per cent in WA, compared to about 14 per cent in the eastern states.
However, analysts such as Morgan Stanley estimate that Aldi will take 5 per cent of the food market in these two states within 12 months of opening its first stores, taking sales away from all of the players present, but mainly from independent retailers.
In a report released this week, Tom Kirat, an analyst at Morgan Stanley, estimates that IGA retailers could lose $360 million in sales for the year and Metcash $250 million by the end of 2016.
The forecast is based on the assumption that Aldi will open 25 stores in SA and 30 in WA next year, generating sales of $500 million and $600 million in these markets, respectively.
Losses in revenue and food sales at a high fixed cost to Metcash could cost the company about $13 million in earnings before interest and tax, Mr Kirat said.
At the same time, Metcash is losing market share in the eastern states, mainly to Aldi and Coles, despite a recent Morgan Survey finding that IGA has the most loyal customers.
Morgan Stanley estimates that Metcash food sales will fall 3.8 percent in 2016, 4.1 percent in 2017, and 2.1 percent in 2018, reducing the company's market share from 14 percent in 2015 to 10.3 percent by 2020.
Last week, leading fund manager Hamish Douglass, founder of Magellan Financial Group, told an audience at a business lunch in Melbourne that Metcash "could very well disappear within a decade.
Metcash declined to comment publicly on Mr Douglass's comments.
But a Metcash board member is understood to have contacted Mr Douglas last week.
IGA's market share has fallen from 18 percent to 14 percent since 2010, and Metcash's revenue from the food business, which the company supplies to about 1,200 IGA retailers, has fallen 43 percent compared to 2012 due to operational deleveraging and pressure on sales and profitability.
Nevertheless, the company is not giving up, spending more than $150 million annually to equalize retail prices with those at Coles and Woolworths on a thousand items each week, and helping IGA retailers rebuild their stores, as well as offering a rapidly expanding range of fresh produce and a wider range of branded foods.
Metcash chief executive Ian Morris says price equalisation and refurbishment of retail space is gaining momentum, and hopes the company will deliver higher net profit in 2017 for the first time in four years.
Thanasi Kokkinakis backs Tennis Australia president Steve Healy
Thanasi Kokkinakis deserves credit, not criticism, for his behaviour.
Thanasi Kokkinakis has suffered indirectly in the recent scandal surrounding his friend Nick and deserves more credit for his behaviour than critics, according to Tennis Australia president Steve Healy.
Kokkinakis, the youngest of the talented duo and often referred to as "Special Ks," was unwittingly thrust into the spotlight by "infamous altercation with Stan Wawrinka at the Montreal Masters.
Soon after, during a heated qualifying match in Cincinnati, the referee had to separate Kokkinakis and his opponent, Ryan Harrison, twice, with Harrison declaring: "Wawrinka should have put Kyrios on his shoulder blades and I should have put this guy on my shoulder blades."
Ever since Kokkinakis was last seen smashing his racket after a cramp in his leg saved Richard Gasquet from a possible defeat at the US Open, Healy has been staunchly defending Kokkinakis.
The teenager is currently in Glasgow, competing with Sam Groth for the right to be second behind Bernard Tomic in the singles in the Davis Cup semi-finals against Great Britain.
"One thing I worry about is that Thanasi has been dragged into the conflict," Healy said.
He did break his racket when he lost his leg at the US Open, but he is not the first player to break his racket when hopes were dashed, and I know Thanasi well enough to be sure he would not be proud of it.
But he's actually handled himself really well in pretty provocative situations at the US, with Harrison etc, and I'm sure he's trustworthy.
He's got a great team around him, he's got a great family and I just think he's been treated a bit dishonest.
He is a very mature 19-year-old, he works hard, fits into the team perfectly, he has never had any problems with other players, he is respected off the court, he trains hard, he is in great shape, he is a very committed and mature young man and I think he should be appreciated.
Healy also backed the decision to pardon Kyrios for the important match starting on Friday, believing "mutual consent" was the right way forward for everyone but expecting the Canberra lad to return to the team as a long-term player.
"Above all, we want the team to be fully focused on the match, not the controversy around [Kyrios]," Healy said.
And I think Nick has gained strength very quickly, as people like Federer and Murray have shown, he's growing in the public eye, he's made some serious mistakes and deserves all the criticism he's getting, but we're trying to help him understand the consequences of his actions and I think it's necessary to take him out of the spotlight for a while so he can reflect on them and that's best for the team and best for him.
Europe's Migration Crisis: Hungary Declares State of Emergency, Closes Border, Detains Migrants
Having declared a state of emergency, Hungary on Tuesday closed its border with Serbia on its southern border and is detaining those trying to enter the country illegally to stem the flow of migrants.
Riots broke out at the border, with hundreds of migrants massing on the border, to which the Serbian authorities reacted strongly.
Stuck indefinitely on a stretch of road between checkpoints in the two countries, people fleeing armed violence in their homeland pitched tents and settled in the area.
But discontent was mounting.
As a police helicopter circled above them, the migrants shouted "Open the border!" and shouted insults at Hungarian riot police.
Some refused food and water in protest.
Serbia's foreign minister has declared it "unacceptable" to expel migrants back from Hungary when more and more are arriving from Macedonia and Greece.
Serbia wants to be part of the solution, not collateral damage.
Negotiations with Brussels and other countries should be held in the coming days, "Ivica Dacic said in Prague.
The unrest on the Hungarian-Serbian border comes a day after the 28-country bloc failed to develop a common immigration policy at a joint meeting in Brussels.
Ministers agreed to share responsibility for 40,000 asylum-seekers in overcrowded Italy and Greece, and expressed the hope that in the future (next month or by the end of the year), an agreement would be reached whereby EU member states would accept an additional 120,000 refugees, including refugees from Hungary.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria on Tuesday demanded an emergency EU summit next week to discuss the immigration crisis engulfing the continent.
Hungary, however, does not expect quick action from Brussels or its neighbors.
Tuesday's declaration of a state of emergency in two southern regions gave authorities more authority to deal with the crisis, allowing them to close roads and speed up asylum cases.
Meanwhile, Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto has announced that his country is also planning to build a barbed-wire fence along the border with Romania to stem the flow of migrants through the country, now that it has finished the fence on the Serbian border.
CBS News correspondent Charlie Dagata reported that even the prisoners were involved in the urgent work of completing the barbed-wire fence between Hungary and Serbia.
Over the past few months, Hungary has become the EU's main bottleneck and border crossing point for migrants, many of whom are refugees - victims of the wars in Syria and the Middle East.
Nonetheless, Prime Minister Viktor Orbán insists that most of the people entering the country are economic migrants seeking a better life, not war refugees who are entitled to protection, a view sharply at odds with that of other EU countries, including Germany.
New laws, which entered into force in Hungary at midnight, now make it a crime to cross or damage a 4-meter (13-foot) barbed-wire fence built by the government along the southern border with Serbia, and include longer prison sentences for those accused of human trafficking.
"Due to the situation caused by mass migration, the Hungarian government declares a state of emergency," government spokesman Zoltan Kovacs told reporters in the southern city of Szeged.
We are making it clear that illegal border crossing is a crime.
Formally, parliament has yet to authorize the deployment of military forces, which is expected next week, but Associated Press reporters stationed at the border have been observing heavily armed troops with vehicles and dogs for days.
György Bakondi, Orbán's national security adviser, said authorities had caught 45 people trying to cross the border at the border itself, and another 15 inside the country.
They crossed the border by breaking the fence, are currently in police custody and are accused of committing administrative violations under the new laws.
Authorities are quickly repairing the fence.
Hungarian authorities also closed two of the seven border crossings with Serbia on Tuesday morning, bringing in a barbed-wire-wrapped railway wagon to block one passage.
Riots broke out at the main border crossing near the town of Rjoske, Hungary, as Hungarians set up an office to allow people inside a metal container and crowds pressed each other to break in.
Approximately 20 people managed to get inside, while thousands remained outside.
Another group of migrants blocked the main highway from Serbia to Hungary and announced that they would refuse food and water until they were allowed into Hungary.
Election 2016: Hillary Clinton's advantage over Bernie Sanders halves in national poll
Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton continues to hold a double-digit lead in the Democratic race for the nomination across the country, but Senator Bernie Sanders is catching up.
Clinton now has 47 percent support among Democratic primary voters (down from 58 percent), while Sanders comes in second with 27 percent (up from 17 percent).
Vice President Joe Biden, who has not yet announced whether he plans to run for president, has the support of 15 percent of Democratic primary voters.
More than five months before the primary contest, most Democratic voters say it is too early to say whether they have made up their minds about the candidate they will support.
Clinton supporters are more confident about their choices than supporters of other candidates.
Since the CBS News poll last month, Clinton has lost the support of some demographic groups, and Sanders has gained some ground.
Clinton holds a large advantage among women and moderates, but that advantage has shrunk.
Her support among men has plummeted, with Sanders lagging just 5 points behind her.
Clinton's preference among Democratic voters under 50 has disappeared, and she and Sanders are now on an equal footing.
But Clinton still holds a large advantage among older voters.
Last month, Clinton beat Sanders by double digits among liberals, but Sanders now has a 5-point advantage in that group.
Nearly half of Democratic primary voters nationwide say they would enthusiastically back Clinton if she were the party's nominee.
A quarter would support her with some reservations, and another 15 percent would support her just because she is a candidate.
Six percent would not support it.
Perhaps unsurprisingly, Clinton's current supporters are likely to be more enthusiastic about her.
Among those who currently do not support Clinton, views are more contradictory - only about a quarter would enthusiastically support her.
While 48 percent of Democratic primary voters say they would enthusiastically back Clinton, fewer Republican voters say the same of their leader, Donald Trump (35 percent).
When Clinton supporters are asked openly why they want her as their candidate, the most popular answer is that she has the right experience (16 percent), followed by that it is time for a woman president (13 percent), and that she is the best candidate for the job (10 percent).
Clinton supporters also cite an association with Bill Clinton (9 percent).
It is also called consent on issues and the chances of being elected.
As the vice president mulls a potential run, 57 percent of Democratic primary voters would like him to join the race - though a third believe he should not.
When asked who they would like to see in second place among the party's candidates, Democratic primary voters mostly name Biden.
Among Clinton supporters, more than half say they would choose Biden as their second choice, more than Sanders.
If Biden decides not to seek the Democratic nomination, Hillary Clinton's advantage over Sanders will increase from 20 points with Biden in the race to 30 points without him.
Fifty-five percent of Democratic voters see Clinton as the candidate with the best chance of winning the general election, down from 78 percent last month.
By that measure, Biden is well behind in second place, but the percentage of those who consider him the most likely candidate has increased.
Still, when asked what matters most about a candidate, Democratic voters choose options other than a chance to be elected.
Similar to the situation last month, no Democratic candidate or potential candidate is an untenable nominee for these primary voters.
Democratic candidates, or would-be candidates, performed well on some key characteristics among their party's primary voters.
Most view Clinton, Sanders, and Biden as honest and trustworthy people with good leadership qualities.
Biden leads all three in honesty, and Clinton's strength lies in her leadership qualities.
Thirty percent of Democratic primary voters don't think Clinton is honest and trustworthy, twice as many as those who say the same of Sanders (15 percent), but 27 percent don't have an opinion of him.
Democratic primary voters also generally view the ideological views of Clinton, Sanders, and Biden as similar.
By all of these measures, about a quarter of Democratic voters have no opinion of Sanders.
Although questions about Hillary Clinton's private email account and server while she was Secretary of State continue, most Democratic primary voters are satisfied with her explanation and believe that it has not adversely affected their overall view of her.
But this is a different story for the American public at large.
Half of Americans today are dissatisfied with its explanation, and only about a third are satisfied.
Public opinion was divided back in March, shortly after the story came to light.
Most Americans say the email controversy has had no impact on their overall view of Clinton, though 36 percent say their opinion of her has worsened.
They are mostly Republicans, with more than six in 10 saying their opinion of Clinton has deteriorated.
Even though Clinton is viewed as honest and trustworthy by her party's voters, this continues to be a problem for her among registered voters as a whole: only 32 percent consider her honest and trustworthy, down eight points from last month, and 15 points from May.
Sixty-two percent of registered voters do not consider her honest and trustworthy.
At the same time, 55 registered voters across the country do not think Trump is honest or trustworthy.
Clinton and Trump both, however, are doing well in the polls.
Of the six candidates tested, Biden, Carson, and Bush perform best in terms of honesty.
Most see Sanders as more honest than not, but, like Carson, many have no opinion of him.
The margin of error for a sample of 351 Democratic primary voters is 6 percentage points.
Ben Carson comes close to Donald Trump in national poll
Ben Carson comes close to Donald Trump in latest CBS / New York Times poll
The two candidates received half the popular vote in the new poll, leaving the rest looking for a foothold under their feet
Republican voters across the country continue to support Trump in droves, with support rising from 23% in a recent CBS poll conducted before last month's Fox News debate to 27% in a poll conducted Tuesday.
But Carson soared from 6% to 23% over the same period.
The poll also showed Carson with support across all demographic groups, eclipsing Trump among college-educated Republican voters.
The other candidates, with the exception of Carly Fiorina and Ohio Governor John Kasich, have slipped back along with Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker, whose support has fallen from 10% last month to 2% now.
Former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee, and Florida Senator Marco Rubio combined for third place with 6%.
The margin of error for a sample of 376 Republican voters in this latest poll is plus or minus 6 percentage points, the poll was conducted in September.
A recent CNN / ORC poll released last week showed Carson up in the polls - showing 19% support among Republicans, followed by Trump with 32% support.
The latest ABC News / Washington Post poll also showed Trump well ahead of Carson.
As support for Carson soared last week, Trump lashed out at the former neurosurgeon, even as Carson apologized for questioning Trump's faith.
"We need energy," Trump said last Saturday during a campaign stop in Iowa.
Five fraternity members charged in death of Baruch College freshman
About two years after a college student died during a fraternity rite in the Pocono Mountains of Pennsylvania, five people have been charged with murder.
"Members of the Pi Delta Psi fraternity at New York's Baruch College brutally attacked Chan" Michael "Deng during an initiation ceremony in September 2013 and did not take him to hospital in time, resulting in his death," police said.
Officials say the blindfolded student with a 30-pound backpack with sand behind his back was pushed several times as he tried to reach his target on a slippery surface.
Mr Deng eventually complained of a sore head and then fell unconscious.
Members of the Pi Delta Psi fraternity did not call 911 when Deng fainted and waited for at least an hour before taking him to the hospital, police said.
They did, however, find time to change Deng's clothes, Google his symptoms, and contact Andy Meng, the fraternity's national president, to ask for advice, Police Chief Chris Wagner said at a news conference.
"At that point, members of the fraternity began to hide personal property, essentially putting the welfare of the fraternity ahead of Michael Deng's health," Chief Wagner said.
He could not be saved and died the next morning.
According to the autopsy report, Deng suffered several blunt injuries to his head, torso and thighs.
"Too many families have suffered as a result of fraternity initiation rituals, with at least one student dying during them every year since 1970," Douglas Feierberg, an attorney representing the Deng family, said in a statement.
The Brotherhood and its members must be held accountable, and this step on the part of the authorities is very important.
A Monroe County jury leaned in favor of a third-degree murder charge for the first five members.
Thirty-two other members, including Mr Meng, will be charged with assault on a novice and criminal conspiracy.
"We want to hold accountable not only the individuals involved, but if there is an organization that sanctioned it formally or informally, then so be it," Wagner said at a news conference on Tuesday.
Baruch College banned fraternities, and the National Fraternity eliminated the local chapter from its structure.
What happens when the Fed raises interest rates
Rates will rise, the bull market will falter, bond yields will rise, and the economy will fall into recession.
We know that.
What we don't know is how long it will take to come and how long it will last.
For the economy, history explains little about time.
The recession came just 11 months after the first rate hike and for a full 86 months.
The Fed's rigidity in raising rates often, though not always, determines how the economy and financial assets react.
That is why the US central bank's administration has been so insistent that investors should not focus on when it will start raising rates, but on how long it will take to adjust.
Indeed, there are many variables at play.
In the end, however, market participants may find that all the fuss about rate hikes is exaggerated.
"The Fed's first rate hike since the onset of the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as signaling the end of the era of" cheap money, "Julian Jessop, chief international economist at Capital Economics, said in a note to clients.
On the contrary, we do not expect the gradual return of US interest rates to more normal but still low levels to be the seismic impulse that many fear.
This does not mean, however, that there will be no consequences.
Here is a look at how some areas of the economy may have responded, depending on historical trends:
As the market has seen over the past month or so, the expectation of a rate hike could lead to volatility for some time.
When rates rise, however, the consequences are usually not as dramatic.
"Equity yields do not seem to have slowed for 12-24 months after the first jump, which again probably reflects a lag in monetary policy," Deutsche Bank analysts said in a recent study of the Fed's rate hikes.
Specifically, over the past 35 years or so, the market has moved more rapidly - about 14 percent - toward higher rates, remained fairly flat for 250 days thereafter (an average increase of 2.6 percent), then returned to normal after 500 days, with an average return of 14.4 percent over the past six cycles, according to a recent analysis by Bob Doll, chief equity strategist at Nuveen Asset Management, published in Barron's.
Deutsche says the result for equities tends not to become more pronounced immediately as rates rise, and equity returns start to decline.
Recessions are a fact of economic life, but rate hikes often play into their hands.
In this case, the Fed is facing conditions that did not exist before, and that could precipitate a recession.
Basically, gross domestic product will be near its lowest point since the rate hike.
According to Deutsche Bank, in 118 rate hikes since 1950, only twice has nominal annual GDP been below 4.5 percent.
Even though it was 3.6 percent in the second quarter of 2015, few believe it will last long, with it holding at just 1.5 percent in the third quarter, according to the Atlanta Fed.
Raising rates against such an unstable economic backdrop could be risky and raises the question of "whether this time will be different," Deutsche said.
Market participants have been gearing up for a Federal Reserve rate hike all year, with their eyes fixed on the Federal Open Market Committee meeting that ends on Thursday.
While many strategists and economists believe that the FOMC could approve a rate hike at this meeting, futures trading suggests only a 25 percent chance.
"In our study, from 1950 until today, all rate-raising cycles have been in a super-cycle of increasing fiscal leverage, with GDP overlapping the peaks preceding the recession very quickly after the recovery begins," the report said.
By contrast, it was an extremely slow recovery from the worst recession of the period.
The current cycle is the longest the Fed has been waiting for since the end of the last recession, with a record of 35 months, 74 months in all, and not yet over.
Fixed income has also become volatile at a time when the market expects rates to rise, a scenario that is somewhat similar to the one being pursued for stocks.
The fundamental difference is that the effect on bonds will be faster than on equities when the Federal system changes course.
In the case of bonds, it seems that yields change vector immediately after the first rate hike / cut in the cycle.
At the end of a rate hike cycle, bond yields immediately fall, "Deutsche said.
Policymakers at Charles Schwab believe that higher rates will cause long-term and short-term bond yields to converge, making the curve flatter.
High-yield bonds often do better in this climate, though "we still fear yield volatility," said Kathy Jones, fixed-income analyst at Schwab, in a research note.
Interestingly, Jones believes that markets have already adapted to the expected outcome of the Federal Reserve's policy.
"In addition to a stronger dollar and falling inflation expectations, there are signs that the market has adjusted to the prospect of tighter monetary policy," she wrote.
Short-term interest rates have risen, the yield curve is flatter, credit spreads have widened, and volatility has increased - all features of the market as the Federal Reserve tightens policy.
Generally speaking, companies that do most of their business in the US would benefit from higher interest rates, and local products would become more attractive.
Multinational companies with a lot of debt will be worse off, as a rising dollar makes their products more expensive in the global marketplace and their debt more expensive in the financial arena.
"History shows that" quality "stocks perform well above the market within three months of the initial rate hike," Goldman Sachs analysts said in a client report.
Stable companies outperformed unstable companies with each rate increase in 1994, 1999, and 2004 by an average of 5 percentage points.
High-return and low-volatility stocks also performed better than low-quality stocks, on average, by 4 (percentage points) and 3 (percentage points), respectively.
Debt will become a big issue.
Companies with high floating-rate debt would lose the most, Goldman said.
Beyond purely exchange-traded transactions, consumers will benefit from a rising dollar.
Savers could also see profits through higher returns, though experts differ on how quickly this will happen.
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of Classic FM, says Conservative MP Andrew Bingham
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham criticised the station for "lowering standards"
Proves that it is becoming increasingly indistinguishable from a commercial competitor
He also took aim at the BBC Music Awards, saying the award was just a dig at the Brits
Fellow MP Damian Collins, who attacked The Voice with similar criticism, was not original
"BBC Radio 3 is turning into Classic FM," the leader of MPs declared, prompting the broadcaster to prove it was doing something that commercial companies did not.
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham also told BBC executives that the public radio station seemed "stupid" and increasingly indistinguishable from its commercial rival.
"Radio 3 seems - I don't like to use the word" simplification "- but it seems to be turning into Classic FM," he said.
He also took aim at the BBC Music Awards, launched last December.
The BBC Music Awards, which launched last year, looks like The Brits under a different name.
So if you're trying to do something different, here are two examples that first come to my mind where you're actually just copying what's already on the market, "Mr. Bingham said.
The BBC's director general has denied the allegations, claiming BBC Radio 3 is way ahead of its commercial rival when it comes to live music and audience education.
What I learn from Radio 3, I don't learn about classical music anywhere else.
And his devotion to live performances and making music can't really compare to anyone else.
"It's also really important, I think, Radio 3's interest in finding new music and promoting new works," he said.
Earlier this year, BBC Radio 3 manager Alan Davey claimed the station had to work much harder to attract audiences than in the past because Britons were less educated in classical music.
But Radio 3 was not the only BBC creation to come under fire for stepping on the heels of commercial rivals during a hearing of the Culture, Media and Sport select committee.
Tory MP Damien Collins has attacked The Voice, the music talent show that the BBC bought from the Dutch broadcaster Talpa Media for an estimated price of £22 million.
Can you see why this program is often discussed for lack of originality and distinctive features?
Lord Hall claims the BBC1 show, which features Paloma Faith and Boy George as judges, was made in "typical BBC style."
He added that he wants the Corporation to "find a hit in its own stable" the next time it launches an entertainment project.
However, he does not see any need to prevent new seasons of The Voice from being commissioned in the future or those who pay the licence fee from being used for other entertainment formats.
Online sales growth slowed in August, and Black Friday may be to blame
There was a seven per cent increase in online sales in the first three months of 2015
Last month saw the slowest growth since records began in 2000
Online sales were boosted three years ago by the use of mobile devices for shopping
Experts believe November's Black Friday could have helped curb spending
For about a decade, virtual shopping has been booming, turning many of Britain's high streets into ghost towns.
But experts say there are now signs that online sales are leveling off, after the latest data showed just a seven per cent increase in the first three months of 2015.
Total spending on online shopping in August showed the smallest increase since records began in 2000, rising by just five per cent.
Experts say there are now signs that online sales are leveling off, after the latest data showed just a seven per cent increase in the first three months of 2015
"If you look at the growth rates in previous years and go back to 2000, there was always a reasonable explanation," Andy Mulcahy, editor of the IMRG sales index, told the Guardian.
He explained that online sales had picked up three years ago when shoppers started using their mobile phones to make purchases.
This meant that more people were able to buy online, and that they could do so in any environment, such as sitting on a sofa.
But now it is reaching a plateau and you can see a decline (in growth).
The Black Friday phenomenon, which came from America, has been cited as one of the reasons for the slowdown in sales.
Experts believe that buyers may have refrained from shopping in the run-up to the event, which takes place on the last Friday in November.
Last year, five times the average number of shoppers rushed to computers to take advantage of bargain offers, bringing down a number of sellers "websites.
Experts believe Black Friday, when shoppers enter the real battle for bargain buys, could deter people from shopping
According to research published by the British Retail Consortium, just over £1 in every five is spent online.
As for goods such as televisions and washing machines, more than one-third are sold through online stores.
At the same time, more than a quarter of people buy clothes and shoes online more readily than in high street fashion stores.
Muslims bury those killed in Mecca crane crash as Bin Laden family sanctioned
Muslims carry the bodies of 29 victims through the streets as first funeral begins in Mecca
At the same time, Saudi Arabia partly blamed construction giant Saudi Binladin Group for the accident
The health ministry said a total of 394 people were also injured after the crane collapsed
Hundreds of Muslims from all over the world flocked to the streets to bury 29 of the victims of a crane collapse at Mecca's main mosque.
Dressed mostly in white, those attending the funeral filled the driveway to pay their respects to the first of the dead who made their final journey to Al-Moaissem Cemetery.
A mournful procession passed the holy site where, just days earlier, a construction crane broke through the mosque's ceiling and fell on worshippers.
The bodies were handed over for burial, while the King of Saudi Arabia fined a construction company owned by Bin Laden's family for an accident that also injured 394 people.
The bodies of 29 worshippers killed when a crane collapsed at the Main Mosque were carried through the streets
Among the dead was father-of-four Qasim Akram, from Bolton, Greater Manchester, who was on his first pilgrimage when the crane collapsed.
Mr Akram was at the Grand Mosque with his parents ahead of the annual hajj.
Saudi authorities have already promised that the Hajj to Mecca will continue as thousands of people continue to arrive in the city.
Today, King Salman said the Binladin Group should not have left the crane boom raised when the crane failed.
An Arabic version of the decree, published by the state-run Saudi Press Agency, said the Binladin Group was partly to blame for the collapse.
The English editorial board of the news agency did not give details, but said the company's leaders had been banned from traveling outside the country.
Earlier this week, Salman promised to investigate the cause of the crane's collapse in the courtyard of the Grand Mosque, where hundreds of thousands of Muslims flocked for the hajj this month.
Binladin Group made no statement about the crane collapse, and its representatives were unavailable for comment.
The royal decree also accused the company of failing to use modern safety measures and failing to coordinate properly with the weather service.
Dozens of cranes surround the Main Mosque of Mecca as part of extensive construction work being carried out by the Binladin Group.
Bin Laden's family has been a close confidant of Saudi Arabia's ruling family for decades and has overseen major construction projects.
Al Qaeda's late leader, Osama bin Laden, was a traitor son whom the family repudiated in the 1990s.
The accident occurred in high winds and rain just days before millions of people arrived in the kingdom for the pilgrimage, which is mandatory at least once in a lifetime for every able-bodied Muslim.
Officials said 158 people remain in hospital.
Officials decided to pay one million riyals (about £174,000) to the relatives of the dead, and the same amount to the permanently maimed.
The remaining victims will receive half that amount.
The head of B & Q claims that the trend is due to the presence of Eastern European craftsmen working for little money
Veronique Laurie says Britons are hiring repair specialists more often
The number of skilled workers from Eastern Europe is growing
The result is the opening of more than 200 new Screwfix stores for specialists
Meanwhile, Kingfisher is closing 60 B & Q warehouses across the country
By Rupert Steiner, Chief City Correspondent for the Daily Mail
The British are said to put aside hammers and paintbrushes and instead hire skilled Eastern Europeans to do the housework
If you can handle a hammer or deftly paint walls, you seem to be in the minority these days.
Because, according to B & Q's owner, Britons are increasingly hiring craftsmen to do simple household chores.
Veronique Laurie, the new chief executive of Kingfisher, which owns the home improvement chain, said a significant influx of skilled craftsmen from Eastern Europe offering services at minimal prices was behind the trend.
As a result, Kingfisher plans to open another 200 Screwfix stores specializing in craftsmen's goods, while closing 60 B & Q. stores at the same time.
Ms Laurie said she would like to see more women on the staff of B & Q stores, as eight out of ten shopping decisions in the store are made by women of the weaker sex.
Currently, the majority of staff are men.
According to her, one cannot ignore recent demographic trends, characterized by a growing number of households consisting of single women, who are more concerned with improving their homes than in the past.
Ms Laurie said: "Our stores are still male-dominated.
Steps must be taken to achieve balance.
Overall, half of our customers are women, and 80 percent of purchasing decisions are made by women.
Women play a major role in the decision-making process.
Ms Lawrie, one of five women at the helm of Britain's leading FTSE100 companies, has also changed the composition of the top management team to include equal numbers of men and women as directors.
Kingfisher is almost the only company in which exactly 50% of managers are women, including the CEO and CFO.
Ms Laurie said: "It was a conscious decision, diversification is an important issue for us.
Finding the right women on the board was not difficult.
After the group took on the costs of closing stores, Kingfisher posted lower half-year profits and sales.
As a result of this trend, Kingfisher, which owns the Screwfix and B & Q brands, is opening 200 new stores
Time to Decide on the US Federal Reserve's Interest Rate
The world is watching the Federal Reserve's two-day meeting to decide whether or not to raise interest rates for the first time in a decade.
A Reuters poll of 80 economists found that just over half of those who thought the Fed would do so as recently as last week now believe it will delay and keep rates in the current range of 0-0.25 percent.
This is a historic event, because it has been seven years since the Federal Reserve lowered the rate to zero.
For the first time, we are coming to the conclusion that the central bank can move away from zero and begin the process of normalizing interest rates, "said Angel Ubide, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The US economy is performing well, the recovery is adding trillions of dollars to the balance sheet, and inflation is low.
But the Fed cannot ignore how the decision will affect the global economy.
He warned the markets to prepare for change, but all indications are that they are confident that the odds are against such a move.
The decision will be announced at 20: 00 CET on Thursday.
A New Balkan Route: Refugees Enter the EU via Croatia.
"Open it!" hundreds of refugees chant at the Khorgosz checkpoint on the Serbian-Hungarian border.
Since Tuesday, Budapest has closed the border to migrants.
Asylum seekers are already beginning to explore other routes to the EU.
One of them bypasses the closed border with Serbia through Romania.
The other is via Croatia and Slovenia to Austria.
According to some reports, buses carrying refugees from Serbia to Hungary are now heading for the town of Šidu on the Croatian border.
Drivers have been ordered by the authorities to go non-stop.
Serbian Interior Minister Nebojša Stepanović assures that his country is doing everything in its power to help the refugees, but its capacity is limited:
Our job is to keep Serbia as safe as possible.
On the other hand, we must also help these people, ensure that they are treated humanely.
But this is a Europe-wide problem.
Solving it is not easy, and no country in Europe can do it alone, much less a small country like Serbia.
Belgrade is asking Budapest to open the border to refugees who do not want to stay in Serbia.
But Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán is adamant:
If someone claims to be a refugee, they must complete the necessary documents in Serbia.
And if he does not, he will not be allowed into our country either, because Serbia is quite safe.
Hungary has already erected a 175-kilometre fence on its border with Serbia.
But Orbán does not intend to stop there: he plans to build a similar fence on the border with Romania.
Bucharest has already declared that this is incompatible with European principles.
Vangelis Meimarakis: "Europe wants to help us."
Vangelis Meimarakis served for years in the center-right governments that left the country in financial crisis.
Now, as interim leader of the New Democracy party, he is challenging Tsipras.
A few days before the election, he met a Euronews journalist.
euronews: Mr Meimarakis, welcome to euronews!
Vangelis Meimarakis: Thank you for the invitation.
euronews: Nine months ago, your party suffered a crushing defeat, losing to the Syriza coalition, but now, according to polls, New Democracy is on a par with it in popularity.
What has changed since then?
Vangelis Meimarakis: Greece has changed, and so have we.
Mr Tsipras lied a lot last January.
Nine months ago, Greece ran a budget surplus and growth prospects.
Now the country is running a budget deficit and unemployment is high again.
Investors left because Mr Tsipras drove them out.
Over the past nine months, Greeks have had an opportunity to assess where the country was in January and Mr Tsipras's false promises.
And now they can easily compare what was promised with what actually happened.
Day-to-day life has become markedly worse since January, when the situation was improving for the majority of Greek citizens.
euronews: But you say that if you win the election, you will seek alliances with other parties, including Syriza.
Vangelis Meimarakis: The fact is that, as we have learned in recent years, Greece cannot move forward without understanding and cooperation.
It is no accident that in all other countries where rescue programs have been or are still in place, political forces and all governing parties have come together to implement a program on which they have agreed, without renouncing their political or ideological autonomy.
That is why I firmly believe that, at this stage, only the cooperation of political forces and institutions will allow the country to move forward.
euronews: Your party voted in favor of an agreement between Mr Tsipras and the country's creditors.
If you become the new prime minister on Monday, will you abide by that agreement, or will you try to change it, at least in part?
Vangelis Meimarakis: In fact, we voted for Greece to follow the European path because we are well aware of the disastrous consequences that leaving the EU would have.
Now Europe is helping us by subsidizing our farmers for their produce, we have solidarity funds, the Juncker package, and help in the banking sector.
All of this would have been lost had there been no treaty with Europe.
But the current austerity measures are the result of the way Mr Tsipras has conducted his negotiations.
I know that Europe does not want to destroy us.
Europe wants to help us.
So, if Europe sees that the new Greek government, in its first year in power, wants to clean up its act, acts rationally, and makes clear that the country has the strong political will to implement the bailout program, then I am sure that all the commitments made that cannot be fulfilled because they lead to recession can be renegotiated, but only after some time.
It would be a mistake to think that in the first year of the new agreement we will be able to renegotiate with our creditors, as they expect the agreement to be fully implemented.
If we are to regain their trust, we must continue the privatization, reforms, and structural changes that have been agreed, while continuing to benefit from EU financing and the greater investment opportunities that we must open up for better understanding and cooperation with Europe.
Unfortunately, during the negotiations, the Tsipras government did not present any serious arguments on many key policy issues, as we found out by discussing these issues with our European counterparts.
I can cite the example of farmers "incomes.
We have explained to our European partners that this is not a fixed monthly income, and therefore it cannot be fully taxed in advance.
We were told that Tsipras's ministers had never said that.
In other words, Greek ministers were unprepared and ill-informed, and thus failed to negotiate and conclude an agreement.
euronews: If you win the election, you will soon be at the same table as Mr Juncker, Hollande, Mrs Merkel, and other European leaders.
Will what you tell them differ from what your predecessor Antonis Samaras told them?
Vangelis Meimarakis: First of all, I will explain to them that until the end of 2014, we tried to implement the 2012 agreement in the best possible way, bypassing the sharp corners it contained.
We pushed reforms forward.
Of course, we lacked the necessary resolve and speed, but we acted in extraordinary circumstances.
The market fell, and there was no sign of potential buyers willing to pay a price that suited the Greek government.
I was Speaker of Parliament at the time, and I managed to reconcile the views of the three parliamentary groups that then constituted the government majority.
And despite their serious ideological differences on key bills, we had a functioning parliament, in the presence of populists and extremists, as well as massive demonstrations outside.
And we managed to steer the country back to normalcy, which would have continued to improve had the process not been interrupted by the early general elections that resulted from the December presidential election.
euronews: In recent weeks, a massive influx of refugees has been moving through Greece.
What do you think about this situation, and the reaction of the European countries to which these people aspire?
Vangelis Meimarakis: The refugee crisis is a ticking time bomb that we will have to deal with after winning the election.
The reason is that the Syriza government did not act as it should have.
In such matters, you should be proactive, because if a problem overtakes you, only emergency measures remain.
And that is where we are now.
Even the interim government that succeeded Syriza did more in just seven days than Mr Tsipras did in seven months.
I am confident that this action by the interim government, with the valuable assistance of the President of the Republic, who has called for an EU summit, will make it possible to find a solution.
We need to see how many refugees can leave the country, and note that refugees are not illegal immigrants.
They are the victims of the war in Syria, the victims of some extraordinary event that happened to them.
There is a deeply humanitarian dimension to this issue, and we will stand by the position that European policymakers must take in this new situation.
The relevant decision should be taken at the EU summit, and the United Nations should be involved.
We also need better coordination, more effective border controls, and refugee reception centres.
We must also make effective use of the economic assistance we receive from the EU to meet this pressing challenge.
euronews: Mr. Meimarakis, thank you for the interview.
Vangelis Meimarakis: Thank you.
In the peaceful city of Druzhkovka, Donetsk region, within 24 hours, officers of the criminal investigation department of the regional police, together with military counter-intelligence, identified and detained a suspect, who turned out to be a 34-year-old Ukrainian serviceman from the city of Krivoi Rog (Dnipropetrovsk region), who, the previous evening, during a joint drinking session, and the resulting conflict in the village of Verkhnetoretsky in the Yasinovatsky district of Donetsk, fired a machine gun at his opponent.
The 22-year-old was reported injured at a hospital, where he was hospitalized with gunshot wounds to his legs.
According to Artem Vasitsky, Deputy Head of the Criminal Investigation Department of the Police Central Office of the region, during the course of operational actions, law enforcement officers proved the defendant's involvement in another serious criminal offense - the murder of a 41-year-old resident of the same village.
Detectives established that on the same day, there was a dispute between the suspect and another local resident, as a result of which he fatally shot the man in the head.
The Investigative Department of the Druzhkovsky Civil Defence Department opened criminal proceedings under the articles entitled "Premeditated murder" and "Deliberate infliction of grievous bodily harm" of the Criminal Code of Ukraine.
The detainee faces up to 15 years in prison.
The figure was detained and placed in a temporary detention facility, the press service of the Donetsk region police reported.
Two residents of Novosibirsk who painted several Soviet monuments in the colors of the Ukrainian flag, including two monuments to Vladimir Lenin, have been sentenced by a Russian court to prison.
Two other residents of the city were sentenced to restriction of liberty.
The residents of Novosibirsk who received prison terms were sentenced to 2.5 years and 2 years in prison.
Two other convicts received 14 and 18-month restriction of liberty.
Leninsky court in Novosibirsk found four citizens guilty of vandalism against monuments to Lenin, which were located on the territory of the regional committee of the Communist Party and on Knitnitnitazhnaya Street, as well as the memorial complex "Monument of Glory."
In the latter case, the Katyusha missile launcher and the T-34 tank were painted.
Recall that on the night of 12 December in Novosibirsk, Russia, unknown individuals painted military equipment in the colours of the Ukrainian flag on the Monument of Glory.
The common-law wife of the popular Russian actor Evgeny Tsyganov, Irina Leonova, has given birth to her seventh child.
The girl was born in a Moscow clinic.
The newborn and her mum are doing well.
Recall that recently, Tsyganov and Leonova parted ways.
Eugene declined to comment.
Irina blames her husband and his ambitions for everything.
Evgeny Tsyganov is 36 years old.
He is an actor in the Pyotr Fomenko Workshop theatre in Moscow.
He is known for the films "Walk," "Cosmos as a foretaste," "Brest Fortress," the series "Thaw" and "Farts."
On September 8, Evgeny Tsyganov was named "Actor of the Year" and "Person of the Year" according to the Russian version of the popular GQ magazine.
Man who opened fire at Delta State University left note apologizing
After shooting and killing his girlfriend in Mississippi on Monday morning - and before he shot and killed his colleague later in the day - Shannon Lamb wrote a note saying he "regretted" the first killing and wanted "everything back," authorities said Tuesday.
Police in Gautier, Mississippi, say a professor of geography and social sciences at Delta State University called 911 around 10 a.m.
Monday and said he shot someone.
Lamb told the dispatcher that police needed to send people to his home.
He said: "I killed my wife last night" and also mentioned that there was a "dog" in the house who "wouldn't touch anyone" but was probably upset.
Police enquired about the caller's name, but he did not name him.
Lamb did not explain why he opened fire.
When police arrived at the crime scene, they found the body of Amy Prentice, 41, and a handwritten note from Lamb, 45, which said: "I'm sorry I would like to bring everything back.
I loved Amy and she is the only one who has ever loved me.
After writing the note, Lamb drove 300 miles to Delta State University, where he killed Ethan Schmidt, a history professor, and took his own life Monday night when surrounded by police.
University President William Laforge said he was not aware of any conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but "Mr. Lamb clearly had something on his mind."
Despite reports on Monday that Lamb had suggested an affair between Prentice and Schmidt, officials on Tuesday said there was "no information or evidence" of a "love triangle."
Prentice was described as a "good man" by Sean O'Steen, who said he had been married to her for about seven years.
They divorced 15 years ago but remained friends.
O'Steen said he and Prentice have a daughter, who is 19, and that she is "inconsolable."
He added that Prentice and her daughter were "best friends."
According to Lindsey Knowles, who The Sun Herald describes as a close friend of Prentice's, the latter worked from home via the internet.
Knowles said Prentiss had a hunting dog named Lightning, and that she had been dating Lamb for about three years.
Knowles said, "She always wanted to help people."
Police said Lamb called relatives at one point Monday to say "he won't go to jail."
That evening, when police caught up with him on Highway 1 near Greenville, Lamb stopped the car, jumped out of it, ran into the woods and shot himself.
According to a resume posted on the university's website, Lamb received a doctorate in education from Delta State University in spring 2015.
Stars Lost Their Luck
The actor (left), pictured with his son Redmond (right), has had a difficult few years.
In 2001 he battled leukaemia and in 2009 he lost his long-term partner Farrah Fawcett to cancer.
The actor also reportedly suffered from drug addiction and was arrested for drug possession in 2008.
All of this has certainly played a part.
Manchester United's Luke Shaw out for months due to double fracture
Luke Shaw broke his right leg in two places during a Champions League match in which Manchester United lost to PSV in Eindhoven.
While the defender is worried about being out of action for at least six months, Louis van Gaal is hoping Shaw can play again this season.
The injury occurred during Hector Moreno's reckless lunge in the 15th minute, when the 20-year-old Shaw burst into the PSV penalty area.
He was treated on the pitch for nine minutes and given oxygen before being taken to hospital.
Van Gaal said: "He has a double fracture and he is in hospital."
He will be transferred to Manchester tomorrow or a day later and then will undergo surgery.
It's terrible - the lad came to Manchester United at the age of 18, overcame a lot of difficulties and played fantastically and then it happened.
In the changing room he was wearing an oxygen mask.
He was crying.
I'm not a doctor, but if you have a double fracture, it's for six months and the guy won't be able to play in the group stage.
I hope he can play again this season.
Moreno was lucky he didn't get a red card and a penalty.
The referee, Nicola Rizzoli, did not penalise the Mexican.
Van Gaal believes the Italian referee made a mistake.
Judge for yourself when I say it's worth a penalty and a red card.
It was a very bad two-legged ride.
Shaw tweeted: 'Thank you all for your messages, words can't describe how devastated I am, my road to recovery begins, I will come back even stronger than I was.'
More on the topic: Manchester United in trouble with Luke Shaw after defeat to PSV
The England defender will have an added incentive to recover in time for the European Championships in France next June.
Phillip Cocu, the PSV coach, said: "It's a very serious injury."
When any player leaves with an injury like that, everyone is very upset about it.
It was never the intention of our players to injure an opponent.
Moreno suffered a broken leg while playing for Mexico against Van Gaal's Holland team at the 2014 World Cup.
"It's very difficult for him now because he had no intention of hurting his opponent and when you hear that it's a very serious injury, you feel bad," Koku said.
I couldn't see the moment itself.
The only thing I could see was a ball that was flying in the other direction, so it looked like he (Moreno) had touched it, but I didn't see it coming under Luke.
Speaking to SBS6, Moreno said: 'I know what it is, I know how hard it is to endure it.
It's very hard for me and I'm very sorry.
PSV's Andres Guardado was also taken to hospital after colliding with Chris Smalling.
Does David Cameron know anything else about Lorax?
Every parent learns one thing very quickly: if your child likes a book, it won't be long before you know it almost by heart.
Apparently, unless you're David Cameron.
When asked by a representative of a children's holiday company about his favourite children's book, the Prime Minister chose Lorax, an ecological fairy tale written by Dr Seuss in 1971.
It was a difficult choice, Cameron wrote in a comment posted on the SuperCamps website, and continues: "This is a fun, moving, unusual story with a strong message I love to read to my children because it always reveals some image or message that we miss."
All well and good, except for the last paragraph, in which Cameron is supposed to retell the contents of the book but actually tells the plot of the 2012 film of the same name, with new characters and details added to diversify the rather short original narrative.
"In the high-walled town of Vsempleville, where there was no greenery and even air was sold for money, a boy named Ted hopes to win the heart of Audrey, the girl of his dreams, by fulfilling her wish to see a real tree," reads the text of a love story unknown to Dr. Seuss (real name Theodore Seuss Geisel), who died in 1991.
If that doesn't sound suspicious enough, Cameron's text reads almost like a synopsis of the plot of the movie "Lorax," posted on the Internet Movie Database: "In the high-walled city of Vladivostok, where everything was artificial and even air was sold for money, a boy named Ted hopes to win the heart of Audrey, the girl of his dreams."
It seems unlikely that Cameron, admittedly an active parent, is so unfamiliar with the contents of a book in which an unnamed boy learns about the destruction of the environment by greedy tree feller and knitter Nakhodkins, despite the protests of Lorax (whose name is included in the book's title), a funny creature with a moustache who "speaks for the trees."
Most likely, such an easy PR task was entrusted to an artist who had never read a book about Lorax to a child 20 times in a row.
A Downing Street spokeswoman said the text was believed to have come from Cameron's office in the constituency.
SuperCamps confirmed that the text was received from Cameron's office, but had no further comment.
Adam Lyth was clearly in danger of missing out on the England team but it's still a tough call
Victory over Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is no easy task, but if you look at the team England picked for this tour, a repeat of the 3-0 Test series defeat last time out does not seem likely to me.
I wouldn't rule out winning on my own turf, either.
Alastair Cook's team may be less experienced than they were three years ago, but they have spin-friendly players and a collective mindset; they will not carry the scars of 2012, but only the youthful positivity.
With the ball, Moeen Ali is turning into a spin bowler and Adil Rashid, even if he is an unknown figure for Test level, is an attacking option.
Related: Adam Lyth dropped from England Test cricket team and replaced by Alex Hales
The decision to exclude Adam Lyth is, of course, difficult for me, his head coach at Yorkshire.
His seven Test matches have involved two good attacks in difficult conditions, and the obvious but brutal reality is that cricketers are judged by referees on results.
There was no question about John Root, for example, which led to this announcement, because (and I have said it before) players are best at picking themselves.
A couple of half-centuries and Lita might have had a longer career, but he was in control of his own destiny.
Hopefully, if he scores more runs for Yorkshire, there will be another opportunity.
England's head coach, Trevor Bayliss, spoke well about his attitude even when he wasn't showing what he is capable of and that doesn't surprise me; he's first and foremost a team player and then everything else.
How long it will take for a Test cricket batsman to make an impression is a complex question.
Leith played in seven games, as did Sam Robson before him and Nick Compton in nine.
Only Compton got a chance to play on his own and on someone else's pitch.
The only thing you could complain about is that England picked Jonathan Trott for the Caribbean Premier League when Leith was in top form, but this lost opportunity is in the past.
Alex Hales comes in and he's a batsman I rate highly.
He is an unpredictable cricketer, as we saw at the Yorkshire club earlier this season when he scored 236 against us at Trent Bridge, which was something else.
He should at least be given the same opportunity as those before him, but that will of course depend on the line-up in the UAE.
The idea of putting Moeen next to Cook as the opening batsman, which would allow for the introduction of an extra spinner while retaining four fast bowlers, is being mulled over and I don't mind at all.
I don't see any reason why a batsman can't hit the ball out there, and this left-armer has already shown he's a hell of a good cricketer.
Moeen may not be quite what he needs for his Worcestershire county, but he is number three for them and there is no big difference.
My old team-mate Justin Langer played his first 38 Test matches as the third batsman before coming out as the opener in 2001.
He won three hundreds straight away and didn't look back.
Zafar Ansari comes into the team as a reserve spinner and when I spoke to him briefly he seemed to me to be a very promising young man.
People might look at his rough statistics - an average of 31 with bat and 35 with ball - and think it's a risky bet, but few spinners vote "yes" and selectors choose youth.
He will learn a lot on this tour.
Aside from the national team, England plan to make a couple of practical additions to the coaching staff.
Appointing Mahela Jayawardene, the Sri Lankan batsman, as a consultant for Test matches could be a masterful move.
He is one of the best guys in the game who will bring a wealth of experience to the game, gained under all possible conditions and in all kinds of attacks.
Paul Collingwood is included in those white-ball games and will provide both energy and ruthless pace in the setup.
I've always felt he was born to be involved in international cricket, whether it's playing or coaching, and, like Mahela, has a lot of intelligence.
Sometimes new voices in the dressing room, even if they say what has been said before, can invigorate a team.
Colley's Durham team-mate Ben Stokes is left out for the one-dayers, Root has been given a similar break with Australia and I don't have a problem with that, for example.
While not everyone will agree, coaches and selectors do not set the schedule.
And you have to remember, as players, their positions depend on the results.
Such decisions are never taken lightly.
The Leave camp could win if the economy is in the doldrums by 2017
David Cameron's ill-conceived policy of reopening negotiations to keep Britain in the EU is proving increasingly difficult by the day, even without the election of the brilliant Jeremy Corbyn as Labour leader or the TUC's indignation over Europe on Tuesday.
Foreigners have their Corbyn and Nigel Farage, too.
A friendly European diplomat explained the other day that, with the EU facing multiple crises - not all of them of its own making - some member states are fed up with Britain's self-centered agenda of divisive concessions and disruptive changes that they largely do not want.
Meeting in Brighton for its annual meeting, the TUC decided that it did not want them anyway if they destroyed social security.
We might even call it "Dave and George's selfie programme."
The prime minister and finance minister ride through summits and bilateral sessions in foreign capitals, take pictures of themselves in front of a famous local monument, with or without a local celebrity, then come home and say they are attracting allies for reform.
It's all about me.
My European pal who wants an outward-looking Britain under the EU's tent - "Don't leave us with France," says Berlin - suggests that blinkered ministers and officials in some capitals get to grips with when they don't care whether we stay or leave.
Angela Merkel, Germany's cautious chancellor, is an ally, but she has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave the cabinet before things get worse for her, just as they did for Thatcher (11 years), Mitterrand (14), and Kohl (16).
French President François Hollande faces re-election or replacement in 2017.
It, too, is losing strength.
Poland may soon get a nationalist right-wing government, Spain a left-wing one.
It is hard to see them climbing out of their skin to help the "selfie-Brits," whose energy could be expended on preventing Scotland from leaving the UK - which they also don't want, because most have similar separatist tendencies.
So some of these ministers may even be planning to issue deliberately useless SNP-style remarks during the UK referendum campaign in 2017, in order to spur the UK's exit from the EU, my friend suggests.
"The renegotiation was a fix" and "Britain got nothing of value from the renewed negotiations."
Europeans know for a fact what a predator Fleet Street can be, and how skeptical the media moguls are about the EU, unlike when Tony Benn launched a referendum in 1975, which supported our entry by a 2-1 margin in 1973.
They may vaguely remember Boris Johnson, the hardened Euro-opportunist who became famous for his "straight EU bananas" as a Brussels correspondent in the early 1990s.
For all his stupidity, Ed Milliband knew who his enemies were.
They included a motley company of tax-fearing crooks, rogue telephone hackers, and pseudo-non-residents who own most of our major newspapers.
In fact, Tony Blair had exactly the same opinion of them, but was aware that when you are in a cage with a raging gorilla, you must give them bananas to distract them and prevent them from eating you for lunch and again with tea.
In fact, Milliband was more committed to Blair than Blair himself in opposing Cameron's referendum idea, because Blair sacrificed principles in favor of the abrogated EU constitution buried by French and Dutch voters in 2005, who gave him the winning ticket.
The press has not forgiven him for any of this.
But the darling of Jeremy Corbyn, who gave me a friendly pat on the back at Westminster on Monday - I told him he no longer had time to waste on me - seems to be in danger of repeating Neil Kinnock's strategy of "boycotting Murdoch" from the 1980s - a mistake then and now.
It may take time, but he needs to develop a coherent strategy for dealing with the press - not with me, but certainly with Andrew Marr, on whose BBC sofa he sat on Sunday.
Corbyn's official position on Europe is what I delicately call evolution.
He says he wants us to stay in a reformed EU.
Indeed, most people outside's traditionalist tendency and the wider Tory "Little England" constituency can probably say yes.
This is what Hilary Benn - "Benn, not Bennite" - said on radio and TV this week, with his inner Boy Scout struggling to accept that Corbyn's appointment of the hapless John McDonnell as shadow Chancellor of the Exchequer was a bad idea.
It reminded me of the 1970 "s, when his old father fought hard on TV for disloyalty to his Labour Cabinet colleagues, without going too far or losing his cabinet position.
Hillary's battle was more appealing.
But the fight to remain "under any circumstances" - Benn's phrase - is not what McDonnell said, nor what J.C. told peers and MPs in a private meeting on Monday night, by all accounts.
Whatever Democrat and "guy" Corbyn wants to say - remember, he touched even me - the discipline of messaging remains important in an age of 24 / 7 television, and especially in the maelstrom of social media, a hotbed of paranoia and treachery.
It is sensible not to let Cameron get away with Europe so easily by allowing him to take for granted Labour's support during the referendum campaign, as McDonnell said.
Simon Jenkins certainly thinks so.
But the central misconception of McDonnell and Corbyn about EU membership - within the Bennite economy of a besieged fortress - is no longer a matter of esoteric debate among left-wing dissidents, for whom narcissism born of insignificant differences is a central principle in dogmatic debate.
As for his misconceptions about Nato - Tom Watson is adamant that JC will not campaign for Leave - foreign diplomats will be obliged to try to convey this to their superiors at home.
Why should Paris or Berlin spend political capital - they, too, have suspicious voters - to make concessions to Britain when it might all be futile?
The US is already deeply frustrated by the weak British military action in Iraq, Libya, and Syria, even as the Tory government in power cuts spending, as I was reminded on Monday at a lunch at a forum called British Influence Security.
Experts criticize Public Health England review of e-cigarettes
The government-funded agency's claims that e-cigarettes are 95% less harmful than smoking were made at a meeting of 12 people, some of whom are related to the tobacco industry, researchers said.
Experts published in the British Medical Journal (BMJ) in conjunction with the Lancet have criticised the evidence used by Public Health England (PHE) in its report on e-cigarettes.
PHE published an important report - a "turning point" - last month, calling it a "comprehensive review of the evidence."
But some researchers have questioned the validity of the data and pointed to the association of some experts with the tobacco industry.
An editorial in the medical journal Lancet last month criticised the "extremely shaky argument" on which PHE based its main conclusion.
In the BMJ article, two other researchers questioned whether the claims were based on "firm or tenuous grounds."
Martin McKee, lecturer in European Health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and Simon Capewell, lecturer in clinical epidemiology at the University of Liverpool, said: "The fundamental principle of public health is that rules must be based on evidence of effectiveness."
They said the public expects PHE's claim that "the current best estimate shows that e-cigarettes are about 95% less harmful than smoking" to be based on a detailed review of the evidence and simulations.
In fact, this is deduced from a single meeting of 12 people who came together to develop a multi-criteria decision analysis model to summarize their views on the harms associated with various nicotine-containing products, the results of which are summarized in a scientific publication.
McKee and Capewell said one of the sponsors of the meeting was a company called EuroSwiss Health, whose CEO was previously reported to have received funding from British American Tobacco for an independent study.
He also confirmed BAT certificates in the health sector in the Sustainable Development Report.
One of the 12 people at the meeting announced funding from an e-cigarette manufacturer, without mentioning the funding he had reportedly previously received from tobacco company Philip Morris.
A reasonable explanation for the selection of the board members has not been provided, but there are several prominent e-cigarette advocates among them, some of whom have also claimed industry funding in the publication.
It is not known if the other participants at the meeting have experience in tobacco management.
The meeting was also attended by the head of the tobacco division at PHE.
A scientific paper published by the group "gracefully agrees" that there is a lack of "hard evidence for the harmful effects of most products by most criteria," McKee and Capewell wrote.
However, none of these linkages and limitations were addressed in the PHE report.
McKee and Capewell said PHE's claim that "there is currently no evidence that e-cigarettes are expensive, leading children or non-smokers to smoke" is premature.
Prof Kevin Fenton, PHE's head of health and wellbeing, said the BMJ's claims had previously been answered.
He said: "E-cigarettes are significantly less harmful than smoking."
One of the two lifelong smokers died of his addiction.
All the evidence suggests that the health risks from e-cigarettes are relatively small, but we must continue to study the long-term effects.
PHE has a clear responsibility to inform the public about what the evidence proves and what it does not prove, especially where the public had doubts about the relative dangers compared to tobacco.
Around 80,000 people a year die from smoking-related illnesses, and smoking costs the NHS £2 billion a year.
By making clear the obvious - that while e-cigarettes are not safe, they do only part of the harm caused by smoking - we are fulfilling our tasks to the nation.
Former Channel 4 chief says BBC should stop EastEnders series
Former Channel 4 boss Luke Johnson believes the BBC should stop producing programmes such as EastEnders and The Voice, noting that their business rivals would have given much for such successful shows as the soap opera Albert Square.
Johnson said the licence fee should only be used to produce programmes that are not produced by other British broadcasters.
He criticised the BBC for putting public broadcasting, which is likely to be watched by only a small proportion of the audience, at peak airtime when rivals have high-rating shows, and on channels such as BBC4.
After BBC director-general Tony Hall said the corporation wanted more co-operation with other organisations, Mr Johnson said he had tried unsuccessfully for six years while working for Channel 4.
"I can't help thinking that the BBC is preparing to launch and broadcast programmes that could be shown by rival companies that do not receive subsidies," Johnson told members of the House of Lords Communications Committee as part of the inquiry into the future of the BBC.
If you keep the license fee, which I don't think is a good solution in the medium and long term, the company should keep only those programs that are not and are not going to be produced by other companies.
The Voice is airing in a prime-time slot because the creators want as much support as possible for the future.
The idea that no one else should show it is ridiculous and obviously absurd.
Johnson: "I don't understand why regressive taxes should be used to fund transfers that could be funded without subsidies.
The Voice is one such example, EastEnders is another; they are notoriously self-produced.
Other channels would undoubtedly give a lot for it.
I don't see how it can be public broadcasting.
I don't think that would diminish the BBC in any way.
Serial entrepreneur Johnson, who ran Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010, accused the BBC of chasing ratings "because of the ambition of its staff and their belief that this is the best way to win long-term support."
His comments on the BBC's most popular shows echo those of Sky chief executive Tony Ball, who suggested in his MacTaggart lecture in Edinburgh in 2003 that the BBC should sell series such as EastEnders.
Johnson observed that the BBC's more niche shows of a public nature "continue to go to BBC4, where audiences are often not appreciated, but the company's function is done, and this can be used as an argument for the £4 billion in licence fee revenue:" Well, of course we do all these incomprehensible shows that no one watches. "
They put them in a slot where no one will ever watch them.
On the licence fee, Johnson told the committee: "I urge you to find a more regressive system in terms of who gets the most from it.
Of course, you all think we all think £150 a year is a huge amount, but for people for whom £150 is a lot of money, I wonder if they think so because they don't really watch or listen to the BBC.
Former Sky and Channel 5 chief executive David Elstein, who also appeared before the committee last Tuesday, said the BBC should reconsider Reith's mission in favour of "inform, educate and entertain."
He noted that only a small proportion of the BBC's output is now formally classified as educational - 1% of television content and 0.1% of radio content, he said - and that the company should embrace the "inform, educate and entertain" initiative of Australian and Canadian broadcasters.
On partnerships, Elstein noted that the BBC should do more in areas such as "Promenade concerts" (only some of which, he said, are shown on TV), and enter into alliances with commercial broadcasters to make them available for online viewing.
Sonogenetics allows brain cells to be controlled by sound waves
In the video, nematodes can be seen changing direction as they are exposed to sound impulses.
Scientists have bred worms with a genetically modified nervous system that can be controlled using pulses of sound waves.
Tiny nematodes change direction when they are exposed to sound pulses too high for the human ear to hear.
The pulses act by activating neurons that are genetically modified to use membrane channels that respond to ultrasonic waves.
More on the topic: Researchers Control Brain Activity With Light
Scientists said the worms demonstrate the capabilities of a new technique called "sonogenetics," which uses ultrasound to excite certain brain, heart, and muscle cells, with the source of ultrasound located outside the body.
Srikant Chalasani, a researcher at the Solca Institute in La Jolla, California, told the Guardian that the technique could one day replace deep brain stimulation - an invasive procedure that sends electrical impulses to the human brain and is used to treat Parkinson's disease.
Nematode worms do not usually respond to ultrasound, but Chalasani found that they began to react when placed in a liquid containing microscopic bubbles.
He found that bubbles amplify ultrasonic waves, which then penetrate worms.
Enhanced ultrasonic waves affect structures called "TRP-4 ion channels," found in the membranes of some worm cells.
Ultrasonic waves cause these ion channels to open and excite the cells that are associated with them, according to a report in Nature Communications.
To create nematodes that can be controlled by ultrasound, Chalasani genetically modified worms so that their motor neurons used TRP-4 ion channels.
During the application of ultrasound to modified organisms, sound waves were amplified by microscopic bubbles and injected into worms, activating modified motor neurons.
The technique is similar to that used in "optogenetics," a new technique that allows scientists to turn on and off neurons using light pulses.
Chalasani argues that sonogenetics may have some advantages over this technique.
Unlike light, which is delivered to the right part of the brain via optical fiber, low-frequency ultrasonic waves pass unimpeded through the body's tissues, so they do not need to pass inside the cranial box.
"We believe that for the treatment of certain neurological diseases in clinical settings, the use of gene therapy and therapeutic viruses could temporarily make human neurons sensitive to ultrasonic signals," Chalasani said.
He added that, in addition, the technique can be applied to muscle and insulin-producing cells.

Ads mock Britain's arms trade
Watch Amnesty International's video protesting the arms exhibition.
Stunning killer drones!
Shin-destroying iron shackles!
Cluster bombs!
Electric light and noise batons that cause unbearable pain but leave no trace!
The cheerful voice and animated animation leave no doubt that this advertisement for the world's largest arms fair is a caustic parody, designed by Amnesty International to draw attention to the British government's intention to "push" weapons to repressive regimes by taking advantage of the ExCeL defense and security technology exhibition in Docklands.

But the special campaign also leads to the sudden appearance of a plethora of posters at bus stops and on subway trains, demanding to see them again.
"Important announcement for the DLR line from 15 to 18 September?" wrote one of them in London Underground font, with an image of the DLR line turning into a silhouette of a tank.
In September of this year, a mob of arms dealers will descend on the DLR line.
300 posters were drawn by artists who exhibited their work at the "Museum of Cruel Design" in Banksy's Dismaland Park.
A collective called the Special Watchdog Group helped distribute them across London using the "advertising space cracker kit," a 6-pound set of wrenches that it claims "gives access to about a third of the advertising space at bus stops on the planet."
Transport for London is uncomfortable with this kind of "vandalism" in the form of unauthorized posters.
One of the parodies released by the Special Watch Group.
According to Gavin Grindon, curator of Cruel Designs and lecturer at the University of Essex, artists are becoming more demanding and keen to bring political art to audiences outside galleries.
Many artists begin to work with protest activists, realizing that they have to go into the real world for the sake of their art if they want to influence society.

Amnesty's video has been viewed more than 100,000 times in 24 hours on Facebook and was created by the pro bono VCCP agency, with the help of a graphic designer and a voice artist who also work for free.
VCCP creative director Matt Lever was struck by the advertising silence around the arms fair - with a pass in the ExCel calendar - and thought: "Let's give them a campaign they're trying to avoid."
They wanted to create more realistic and clever corporate advertising, but "filling it up at home with bright colors and animation was more exciting."
"They have been incredibly helpful in bringing attention to the sale of illegal torture equipment at the exhibition," said Amnesty's Tom Davis.
What we now need is for the UK government to take action and ensure that this torture equipment is not illegally sold right on our doorstep.
Perhaps the most creative art on the subject of arms shows comes from within ExCeL, where exhibitors trade fantastically euphemistic products.
In a press release, Saab disclosed an order for the AT4CS RS for shoulder firing from the US Army.
It includes "an unparalleled cumulative warhead that brings unrivaled armor-piercing action inside the target."

Eight Golden Rules for Living in Student Hostels
It has been 11 years since I moved into a student dormitory as a normal 19-year-old, still a believer in berets and moral relativism, but only now do I recall the strained smiles of those I irritated - and the numerous, long complaints about others.
Basically, what I have learned can be broken down into eight simple rules.
Moving to a hostel can range from slightly nerve-wracking to downright frightening.
It encourages chatter: tell people where you're from, whether you've taken a sabbatical and where you've spent it, whether you support Corbyn and why you "honestly neither love nor hate Marmite, because, seriously, guys, it's just a yeast extract of HAHA, I'll be there."
Breathe.
And help others take a break, too - ask questions and show interest.
It keeps the conversation going and helps you find people you like rather than people you wouldn't even talk to even if your lashes were on fire and they were handing out fire extinguishers.
Give people space.
People's rooms are often turned into drinking establishments, midnight cinemas, and party venues, but they are also places where people dress up and clean their underwear.
More on the topic: Do not even think about starting a university while in a relationship
Introverts are not treated fairly at universities.
Your room should be a refuge, but many dormitories create a culture of staggering from one room to another that fosters friendship, communication, and long friendships.
It can be hell for anyone trying to recover.
Nothing in culture allows you to say, "I like you and I want to continue to be friends with you, but I need you to leave and I can restore the energy I spent talking to you."
Try to feel when a fellow student is tired of communication - not knocking on his door, but sending a text message.
By the way, about the knock: do it.
One guy in my dorm followed this principle: if the door was not locked, he was invited to enter.
He saw something.
Make friends by baking.
As you begin university life at the height of the Bake-Off show's popularity, knocking on people's doors to introduce yourself and present a plate of chocolate biscuits is no longer such a strange act, not so reminiscent of the 1950s with their "Welcome, we're neighbours, I've baked you something, and now smile and I'll ask you personal questions."
Offering homemade treats is a great way to make friends.
Your neighbors will feel obliged to chat with you, and eventually they will probably associate your face with a pleasant surprise.
Of course, it depends on how good a baker you are.
Badly blinded lumps of flour, sugar, and fat are more likely to make people pretend to be asleep when you knock on their door.
Theft of food is a common crime in student dormitories.
Of course, appropriating someone's chicken is theft, but is it theft to get yourself some milk for tea?
Ask the milk owner.
Most likely, he will suggest you not to be shy, even if the inside is seething with rage.
If someone steals your stuff, it's annoying, and I sympathize with you - but try to treat it more adult than my neighbor who poured dishwashing liquid into her milk to avenge those who took it without asking.
She is now in prison.
You should not make noise that will prevent people from sleeping or learning.
Not just to be a decent person, but because you are the very people from the proverb about glass houses.
The girl in my hallway asked a neighbor to tone down the sound of the drum and bass because it was 3 a.m. and she had an exam in the morning.
In response, the neighbor turned up the volume.
When he finally fell silent at 5am, she graciously let him sleep for two hours, then chopped up her music and locked the door behind her for a three-hour exam.
Wouldn't it be romantic if your future spouse lived in the same dormitory as you?
On the contrary, wouldn't it be extraordinarily, before biting your elbows, clumsy if you mistook your neighbor for your future spouse, became infatuated with him, broke off the relationship and had to see him every day, and perhaps watch him pull all of your mutual friends to his side?
Of course, you won't order your heart - but if the hot neighbor is definitely not your future spouse, try to cool your own fervor a little.
The exciting moment you realize that someone has left the keys inside their own locked room, the line between prank and harassment is thinner than it seems.
A good draw is fun, but turns into the opposite in seconds.
Instruct a valuable and interesting safety lesson by hiding something - but never contaminate someone's room with toothpaste and shampoo.
Locking someone else's door and putting the keys in a glass of water, which you then put in the freezer - but don't stick Blu-Tack glue to the ceiling more than twice.
iOS 9: how to install a new operating system on an iPhone after Apple's update
You can request a new operating system by going to Settings, selecting General, and then selecting Software Update.
If it is ready, the phone will allow you to download and install it.
Some experienced problems after installation when an error message appeared telling them that "Updating the application failed."
To avoid this, users are advised to either wait until the excitement subsides, or try to upgrade via iTunes.
Tips on your phone will let you go through the process to the end.
The process may involve removing apps to increase free space - but Apple has minimized the likelihood of doing so by reducing the size of the update, and has also simplified execution with a special utility that suggests removing apps and re-installing them after the process is complete.
Make sure your phone is charged or near the charger during the upgrade to prevent it from running out of battery.
If the charge is too low, Apple will stop the upgrade, because discharging the phone in the process could cause the upgrade to fail.

Washington responded to Russia's military activity with a phone call.
US Secretary of State John Kerry has called his Russian counterpart, Sergei Lavrov, to discuss the situation in Syria.
In his view, Moscow's military support for President Assad only exacerbates the conflict.
At the same time, the head of the White House is not yet going to talk about this with his Russian counterpart, writes PJ Media.
US Secretary of State John Kerry has called Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov to discuss Russia's military activities in Syria.
This is reported by PJ Media.
"Secretary Kerry has made it clear that Russia's continued support for President Assad risks exacerbating and prolonging the conflict, as well as adversely affecting our common goal of fighting extremism, unless we also continue to focus on finding a solution to the Syrian conflict through a direct transfer of power," the US State Department said.
They also noted that Kerry once again emphasized the US commitment to the fight against the Islamic State as part of a coalition of more than 60 countries.
He also noted that President Assad could never be a member.
In addition, the US "will welcome Russia's constructive role in efforts to counter the Islamic State."
Last Friday, White House officials said that they do not know exactly what Russian troops are doing in Syria, but Washington is going to discuss the issue with Moscow.
However, White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest noted that the time for a phone call between US President Barack Obama and Russian leader Vladimir Putin is not yet ripe: "When the president decides that a phone conversation with President Putin is in our interests, then he will pick up the phone and try to make that call."
Barack Obama himself regards Russia's decision to increase its support for the Assad regime as a "losing bet."
I remember our conversation with Mr Putin four or five years ago, when I told him that it was a mistake, that further support for Assad would only make the situation worse.
"But he didn't heed my warnings - and the situation got worse as a result," the US president said.
Imported yachts will be exempt from customs duties.
The Ministry of Economic Development intends to temporarily exempt imported yachts and other floating recreational and sports equipment from paying customs duties and taxes.
Relevant changes to the list of preferential goods for temporary duty-free import were prepared by the Ministry on the instructions of the Government of the Russian Federation.
This was reported to Izvestia by Elena Lashkina, Assistant Minister of Economic Development.
In June 2015, Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev, following his trip to Crimea, instructed a number of agencies - the Ministry of Economic Development, the Ministry of Transport of the Russian Federation, the Ministry of Culture, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Emergency Situations, the FSB, the Federal Customs Service, and the Federal Tourism Agency - to prepare proposals to create favorable conditions for yachting in the coastal zones of the country.
In turn, experts note that the main problem is the complete lack of infrastructure for storing, servicing and maintaining yachts.
Owners prefer to keep their vessels abroad - some €200 million a year goes to the coffers of European states for maintenance, repair and servicing of yachts.
The Russian Ministry of Economic Development has prepared a draft decision of the Council of the Eurasian Economic Commission "On the introduction of amendments to the List of Goods Temporarily Imported with Full Conditional Exemption from Customs Duties and Taxes," providing for the provision of full conditional exemption from customs duties, taxes on imported yachts and other floating recreational and sports equipment.
According to the Ministry, this will certainly contribute to the creation of favorable conditions for the development of yachting in the coastal zones of the country, Lashkina noted.
This issue was submitted to the Subcommission on Customs-Tariff, Non-Tariff Regulation, and Protective Measures in Foreign Trade of the Government Commission on Economic Development and Integration, which met in September, and following the results of the discussion was also approved by the agencies.
As the representative of the Ministry of Economic Development and Trade noted, the proposed measure on full conditional release upon import is essentially a benefit.
Therefore, after the approval of the minutes of the meeting of the subcommission in the government of the Russian Federation, the Ministry of Economic Development will submit a proposal to the Eurasian Economic Commission for discussion with the EAEU member states, Lashkina explained.
The list of imported goods, which are completely exempt from customs duties and taxes, includes goods necessary for the promotion of foreign economic activity and international cooperation, for use in the fields of science, culture, film, sports and tourism, for international assistance, etc. These include office equipment (personal computers, typewriters), measuring devices, drilling equipment, stage costumes and decorations, mobile laboratories and workshops, water skis, racing cars, motorcycles, sports aircraft, books, newspapers, magazines, musical instruments and items for religious rituals.
The press service of the Ministry of Transport of the Russian Federation told Izvestia that they had prepared mandatory decrees on the seaports of Kerch, Sevastopol, Yalta, Feodosia and Evpatoria, which provide for a simplified procedure for the entry and exit of small, sport sailing and recreational vessels into the seaport.
The Ministry of Transport has given instructions to the captains of Crimea's seaports to ensure the application of a simplified procedure for the entry of small, sport sailing and recreational vessels into the seaport and the exit of the listed vessels from the seaport.
The Ministry of Transport has also prepared draft orders of the Government of the Russian Federation on the approval of the boundaries of the Crimean seaport area.
With regard to Yalta and Feodosia, orders have already been adopted, the rest are in the process of approval, the press service of the agency noted.
According to the Ministry of Transport, the Republic of Crimea and Sevastopol should carry out state supervision, classification and certification, and state registration of small vessels used for non-commercial purposes.
The problem is that yachting in Russia is extremely difficult precisely because of poor infrastructure.
If you look at the south of Italy and France, there is a whole industry that is constantly developing and employs a lot of people.
In Russia, virtually everything stands still.
Our coast is of little interest, the only piece where yachts can be operated all year round is the Black Sea near Sochi, Gelendzhik, Novorossiysk, and Anapa.
But the big problem is that the area has very strict border security rules: you need a lot of permits to go out on a yacht.
In addition, the yacht has nowhere to refuel inside Russia.
For two days it can go with its fuel, and then there is a problem where to get it, says Denis Novikov, sales director at Nordmarine.
As for storage facilities, Moscow and St. Petersburg now have special hangars for yachts of up to 30 m. The yachts are also shipped to Turkey, Finland, Sweden and Germany for storage.
Novikov noted that the buyers of yachts are wealthy people, but with the onset of the crisis, demand for yachts declined.
The World Bank has provided Ukraine with a $500 million loan
The World Bank has approved a new loan project for Ukraine in the amount of $500 million for the development of the financial sector.
This was reported by the press service of the international organization.
"The new funding will support a number of priority measures to implement reforms in the banking sector in response to the financial crisis in Ukraine," the statement reads.
The World Bank's Director for Belarus, Moldova, and Ukraine, Qimiao Fan, said reforms in the banking sector would help revive credit in the real economy and stimulate a recovery in economic growth.
He also noted that the Ukrainian authorities have taken impressive steps to reform the economy and the World Bank is showing early signs of stabilization.
But, because of the seriousness of the problems, Fan is calling on Ukraine's government to accelerate reforms.
Earlier, the Polish government approved a €100 million loan to Ukraine, reports RIA Novosti.
Prisons are being asked to create separate units for transgender people.
In October 2015, the Public Council of the Federal Penitentiary Service (FSIN) for the Protection of the Rights of Convicted Persons will discuss, among other issues, the possibility of creating separate units for transgender and transvestite prisoners in penal colonies.
Council member Vladislav Grib told Izvestia about this.
In his opinion, depending on the total number of undecided sex convicts in Russia, it is possible to envisage separate cells, blocks, or even (if there are many such criminals) in the future to create a special colony for transsexuals.
However, Vladislav Grib emphasizes that it is possible to determine whether citizens can serve their sentences in such isolated places only after the convicts have passed the appropriate medical examinations, which prove that the offender is indeed a person who identifies himself as a member of the opposite sex.
Vladislav Grib is confident that isolating transgender people from other prisoners will ensure the safety of those serving sentences.
According to him, the proposed practice successfully operates abroad: in pre-trial detention facilities (where the accused are held pending a court decision), separate cells for transgender people are provided, and special blocks are provided in correctional institutions.
Today, this is the only way to deal with such criminals.
Clearly, they need to be isolated, because the presence of transvestites and transgender people in ordinary cells is dangerous for them, causing suffering for their families and a lot of problems for the FSIN staff.
Humiliation of trans people by their cellmates is guaranteed, says Vladislav Grib.
Depending on how large a city is, or how many sex offenders there are, it is necessary to calculate where to allocate them.
Detention facilities are not exactly needed - only cells, blocks in prisons.
Yes, a separate colony is possible if there are many transgender people.
As explained by Grib, the block can hold 50 or 100 people, and if a specialized building is created in Russia alone, transgender prisoners will be able to enter to serve their sentences there from any region.
Citizens are held in pre-trial detention facilities at the place where the crime was committed, so the inflow of transvestites or transgender persons from other subjects during the investigation and trial is unrealistic, but to introduce such a practice for already convicted prisoners in a separate colony - yes, according to Grib.
Recall that the day before, law enforcement officials were unable to decide in which detention facility - male or female - to identify a 24-year-old transgender person, Dmitry Kozhukov (known as Alina Davis), detained for possession of drugs, because of which a man with a girlish appearance was not arrested.
He was released home under a travel ban.
This news was widely discussed on social networks and in the media, as there really is no mechanism for holding transgender people in pre-trial detention facilities and colonies in Russia yet.
Russian human rights activist and LGBT (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender) activist Nikolai Alexeev supported the idea of creating special places for transgender people to serve their sentences, noting that abroad it is also possible to designate people in penal colonies - male or female - depending on their own desire.
Given the atmosphere in Russian prisons, the proposal is the right one.
Yes, this is a very small percentage, but there is a problem, as well as the issue of ensuring security in prisons for homosexuals, says Alexeev.
Prisons must be safe, so separate blocks could be made for homosexuals as well, especially as there are more transgender people in prisons.
At the same time, Alexeev doubts that there will be many citizens in Russia who are ready to impersonate themselves as trans-sexuals in order to get into a different colony.
Of course, it is possible to introduce a medical examination before placing people in transgendered colonies, but this is not always the case.
For example, in the United States, one of the prisoners, Chelsea Manning, looked like a man, and already in prison said that he wanted to change his gender, Alekseev said.
A person can feel like anyone.
But as long as there are no separate facilities for transgender people, I doubt that prison officers will think seriously about the safety of such people and delve into the subtleties of their orientation or gender identity.
At the same time, Boris Lordkipanidze, an international expert on reproductive health issues in the Russian Federation, noted that the introduction of a new system for distributing transsexual criminals in penal colonies could greatly delay the beginning of the serving of sentences by convicts.
A commission is set up - it is a matter of sexology, psychiatrists conduct long-term observations, it is not a single test on the basis of which a highly accurate conclusion is made.
Today's capabilities of psychiatry allow for this.
Therefore, even before sex reassignment, potential patients always undergo such examinations - they show precisely whether sex reassignment with surgery is a necessary measure, Lordkipanidze says.
However, it is difficult for me to imagine how this system can be implemented in relation to convicts, because, on average, it takes a month for such an examination to take place.
The doctor, although generally supportive of the idea of creating separate units for transsexuals, also doubts that in the current economic conditions it would be expedient to allocate funds for the construction of new premises and medical examinations - there are only a handful of transgender people in Russia.
It is difficult to calculate, there are no official statistics, but if we take into account that homosexuals account for about 5% of the population in Russia, we can say that there are even fewer transgendered people, and those who are deviant and also commit crimes are not at all in number, Lordkipanidze said.
Now, homosexuals and transgender people can receive separate conditions of detention upon petition to the colony administration.
Mikhail Antipov won the Junior World Chess Championship.
In Khanty-Mansiysk, the World Chess Championship among juniors under the age of 20 has come to an end.
The end of the championship was more than intriguing.
The winner was determined only in the last round, and it was Russian Mikhail Antipov, who still managed to overtake Pole Jan-Krzysztof Duda, who seemed to be on his way to the title.
Among the girls, Ukrainian chess player Natalia Buksa celebrated the victory.
The World Chess Championship, held since the beginning of September in Khanty-Mansiysk, already seemed to have lost almost all intrigue by the middle of the tournament distance, as the representative of Poland, Jan-Krzysztof Duda, issued a series of four victories (competitions are held according to the Swiss system of 13 rounds), confidently seized the lead.
Given that Duda was the top-ranked favorite for the championship, and is generally considered one of the most promising young chess players, the likelihood that he would miss out on the lead seemed slim.
And even when Duda slowed down and allowed Russian Mikhail Antipov to reduce the gap to just 0.5 points, he remained the clear favorite in the battle for the title.
After all, Antipov had to win in the 13th round to catch up with the leader.
But even that would not have helped if Duda had won his party.
Plus, this obligatory victory, of course, could have affected the Russian chess player's game and led to unnecessary errors.
Fortunately, Mikhail Antipov managed to avoid them.
He handled Francesco Rambaldi confidently, and then had to wait for Duda, who was meeting Benjamin Bock, to finish his game.
Fortunately for Antipov, the Polish chess player reduced the confrontation with the Dutch to a draw.
Thus, Antipov and Duda scored an equal number of points - 10 out of 13 possible, but Antipov had the best additional indicators.
That is why the leadership of Khanty-Mansiysk Autonomous Okrug, whose governor, Natalia Komarova, traditionally pays great attention to the development of chess in the region, awarded him the main prize.
But there was no intriguing ending to the girls "competition.
The leader of the tournament, Natalia Buksa (Ukraine), needed only to win the title not to lose in the last round, which she did successfully.
Thus, the victory of Russian Alina Bivol did not allow her to catch up with Buksa.
The Russian athlete remained second with a gap of 0.5 points from the champion.
VimpelCom is changing the regional structure.
The company unites the Volga and Ural regions into one enlarged Volga-Ural region, Siberia and the Far East into the East region.
The project will be completed by November 1.
According to Vimpelcom CEO Mikhail Slobodin, the changes are being implemented to "remain a strong player in the market," to develop the company "in new, not always favorable external conditions."
In an interview with Rossiya 24 television channel, Mr. Slobodin specified that they intend to reduce "tens of percent" of staff in Russia.
Rospotrebnadzor inspected 78 Burger King eateries in Moscow and issued 367 orders.
As a result, the restaurant on Volokolamskoye highway was fined 50 thousand roubles, and the establishment on Bolshaya Tula Street was closed for 90 days, but resumed its work after all violations had been eliminated.
43 eateries violated the requirements for the arrangement of premises.
Among other violations, unsatisfactory sanitary and hygienic maintenance of premises, failure to comply with requirements for ventilation, and in some establishments, E. coli bacteria were found.
The Burger King franchise belongs to Burger Rus LLC, the owner of the Chocoladnitsa chain, Alexander Kolobov, and there are 293 eateries in Russia.
Igor Artemyev, Head of the FAS, stated that the agency is against indexation of freight tariffs by 10% and the provision of state subsidies, as requested by OAO Russian Railways.
First they wanted 17% indexation, now they want 10%, plus multi-billion-dollar subsidies from the budget, "he says.
We say: it's wrong, it's too much, cut your costs, learn to save, give up expensive mansions, football teams, your own TV, stop spending money left and right.
He added that the FAS has its own, "much stricter" proposals, which are currently being discussed in the government.
Polymetal is considering a possible net settlement with Sumeru Gold B.V. instead of exercising a put option on shares for the full amount of $300 million, the gold mining company said.
In this case, Polymetal will have to pay Sumeru up to $80 million (the difference between Sumeru's share price and the market price), which can be taken from free cash flow.
Sumeru has until October 3 to exercise the option or request a surcharge.
The details of the talks are not disclosed by Polymetal.
The option was entered into as part of Polymetal's purchase of the Kyzyl project in Kazakhstan.
Nikita Stasishin, Director of the Housing Policy Department of the Ministry of Construction, said that the Ministry, together with the Central Bank, is developing a procedure for the rehabilitation of developers.
"We understand that there is no getting away from it, so we are developing an appropriate mechanism," the official said.
Drafts of the script of the film "Citizen Kane" will be put up for auction.
Representatives of the auction house Profiles in History announced plans to auction draft versions of the script for the film "Citizen Kane," which is considered one of the best works of director, screenwriter and actor Orson Welles.
The auction will begin in Calabasas on September 29, where three draft versions of the scenario will be presented, with an estimated value of $20-30 thousand each, AP reports.
The first draft, written in 1940 by Herman Mankiewicz, is the earliest script in private collections and is entitled "An American," the working title of the film.
The second draft is a fuller version of the script, the third is the final plan of the film.
Ministry of Industry and Trade: targeted food aid will not be the analogue of cards in the USSR.
Deputy Minister of Industry and Trade of Russia, Viktor Yevtukhov, said that the targeted food aid program would not be analogous to the ration card system that existed in the USSR.
It is about modern targeted food aid to the population and support for an effective domestic commodity producer.
I ask you not to speculate on the word "ration card."
I would like to emphasize that the proposed ration cards should not be confused with the echoes of the past times of total scarcity, a card distribution system in which the quantity of food received is rationed.
So far, we have proposed the concept, if it is approved, we will propose changes to the legislation, "TASS quotes Mr Yevtukhov as saying.
Kommersant previously wrote that a program to introduce food stamps for the poor had been introduced into the government.

The president of Rosgosstrakh wants to divorce his wife.
A source familiar with the situation told RAPSI that the president of the insurance company Rosgosstrakh, Danil Khachaturov, appealed to a Moscow court with a lawsuit for the dissolution of his marriage to designer Ulyana Sergiyenko.
The hearing of the lawsuit will begin at the magistrate's court number 100 on September 16.
Danil Khachaturov asks that his marriage be dissolved and that the jointly acquired property be divided.
The court confirmed the existence of a lawsuit for the dissolution of the marriage in the proceedings, noting that the suit for division of property has not been filed and will be heard in the district court.
Alexander Bobreshov, President of Russian Railways, resigns.
Alexander Bobreshov, Vice President of JSC Russian Railways (RZD) for Corporate Security, is leaving the company, Interfax reports, citing a source.
Deputy Prime Minister of Russia, Chairman of the Board of Directors of Russian Railways Arkady Dvorkovich said that the issue of Alexander Bobreshov's departure from Russian Railways was initiated by the new head of the company, Oleg Belozerov.
According to the Deputy Prime Minister, personnel changes in the management of Russian Railways are not connected with the change of the head of the company.
Earlier, Kommersant reported that instead of Vladimir Yakunin, OAO RZD was headed by First Deputy Transport Minister of St. Petersburg, Oleg Belozerov, who was in charge of the financial block.
The new head of the company first announced reforms in the monopoly: a new system of freight tariffs will be created within a year and a half.

As a tool for assessing the professional reputation of top-level Russian managers, the study summarizes the work of Russian managers over the year, identifying leaders in industries and functional areas.
The initial pool of candidates consists of last year's winners.
Last year's winners are invited to confirm their participation as a candidate for this year's rating and nominate members of their management team.
In addition, each of the original roster of candidates is invited to nominate up to ten new managers from other companies, who would be useful to add to the pool of candidates.
It is possible to nominate the following heads of functional areas of the company: CFO, Commercial Director, Marketing Director, HR Director, IT Director, Director of Public and Corporate Relations, Director of Government Relations, Director of Corporate Governance.
Each manager proposed by experts is invited to participate in the rating and given the opportunity to nominate his or her own management team and up to ten new managers from other companies.
Nomination of candidates on the sectoral principle is carried out on the basis of the sectoral classifier of the Association of Managers: information technology, commercial banks, forestry and timber industry, machine building, media business, metallurgy, multi-profile holdings, professional services, communications and telecommunications, service and production of consumer goods, insurance, construction, trade, transport, financial sector, pharmaceuticals, chemical industry, energy and fuel complex.
Each participant is provided with a login and password to enter the site www.top1000.amr.ru, where they can see information about the other participants and can put their scores according to the criteria proposed for each functional area.
The basis of the rating methodology is the principle "The best choose the best": top managers evaluate top managers, functional managers evaluate functional managers.
This principle makes it possible to obtain the most authentic assessment of the professional reputation of colleagues.
The final results of the rating are approved at meetings of expert commissions.
To face-to-face meetings of expert commissions, all interested candidates for this year's rating and multiple candidates for last year's rating are invited.
Commissions are organized along functional lines: a committee to approve the list of top managers and eight commissions to approve the heads of functional areas.
At meetings of expert commissions, it is proposed to approve the submitted lists in alphabetical order (the places are kept strictly according to the online assessment and are classified information until the rating is published) or to make updating corrections to them according to the attached list of reserve candidates.
The names of the companies are given in accordance with the rules of the Russian language and the norms of Kommersant.
At the time of publication of the rating, changes in the status of managers and companies are possible.
The comfortable rate for an investment loan is 10-13%.
According to experts, the market for lending to small and medium-sized businesses in January-April of this year fell by 40%.
What do you think is the situation today?
After the panic of late 2014 - early 2015, the volume of lending to SMEs declined significantly.
The reason is clear: a sharp rise in interest rates.
Lending at 25-30% per annum was not beneficial to anyone.
Whereas previously a bank could put all its possible problems in the future, from late payments to non-repayments, into an increased rate, now it is impossible to do so: rates are already sky-high.
For business, the current level of interest rates on SME loans is uncomfortable.
For a large part of investment projects, the current level is unacceptable from the point of view of their payback.
A rate of 10-13% would allow businesses to invest in a wide range of projects and generate attractive returns on them.
How much do you estimate that entrepreneurs "demand for credit is being met?
After the central bank cut interest rates, the situation improved slightly.
Credit resources have become more accessible.
However, according to our observations, customers have started to apply for loans much less frequently.
First of all, businesses do not understand their development prospects and future revenues.
Today, business has only one way out: it needs to learn to work based on the current economic situation in the country and the region.
We need to monitor current results more closely and monitor the flow of cash.
At the same time, if financial resources are available, new technologies can be used to modernize equipment and reduce production and energy costs.
All of this ultimately allows the company to make products more competitive and maintain business even in an uncertain economic environment.
What are the main trends of the SME lending market that will strengthen and influence its development until the end of 2015?
Will interest rates change?
The forecast for reducing the average rate will largely depend on the central bank's policy, and the regulator is now showing consistency in cutting the key rate.
However, a radical fall in the price of loans to SMEs is not to be expected.
In the current situation, the problem is primarily inflation, which makes it necessary to raise interest rates in order to generate real income.
Moreover, the value of money in Russia will remain high even if the central bank cuts rates.
In terms of delinquency rates, traditionally small and medium-sized companies, constrained both in their ability to replenish cash and in their options for correcting economic behavior, will certainly pose a greater risk to creditors.
I would not expect a significant reduction in the share of bad loans.
The main reason is international sanctions and their negative impact on the country's economy.
The new Mazda CX-5 and street fashion.
That's how the word Mazda is written in Japanese characters.
Beautiful, concise and at the same time quite difficult for those who are used to the Cyrillic or Latin alphabet.
So is the new CX-5 crossover, just like any other model of the brand: unpretentious on the outside, technically perfect on the inside.
The Japanese, simply because they are "Japanese," are able to bring their attachment to the products of the Land of the Rising Sun to a state of utter delight.
You can make any number of arguments in favor of cars from other countries, and a person even in principle would agree with these arguments, but the entire conversation will fall apart with the final phrase: "But this is a Japanese car!
There is nothing to argue about!
Such people should probably love not only technology, but everything else Japanese.
To quote from Base, to season wasabi food, to collect katana and to dress one's girlfriend - no, not in a kimono, of course, but according to the canons of street Japanese fashion: cute, creative and quite unexpected.
Perhaps Japanese school uniforms are the only uniform that girls wear with pleasure after graduation.
It has amazing properties: both sensual and austere.
And the older the girl, the shorter the skirt.
The main change in the appearance of the CX-5 is the radiator grille with five horizontal lines.
But the new pattern of headlights and rear lights, by which the car is instantly recognizable in the stream of cars, changes the look of the car much more.
As ever, the Mazda CX-5 looks very seductive.
The silhouette is harmonious, the shapes sensual, but the appearance has a whiff of rigor.
The police won't have to be called.
Driving the CX-5, one of the safest cars in the world, you can only experience stoic Japanese calm.
The 2.2-litre diesel engine provides high torque over a wide range of speeds.
At the same time, the fuel consumption of this 175 liter S motor is only 5.9 liters. The powertrain is equipped exclusively with an automatic transmission and four-wheel drive.
Black boots, black cape, black bag...
To add a bit of black humour to the look, you can opt for Not Cross-printed leggings.
However, Mazda has made every effort to ensure that you do not get behind the wheel of the CX-5 at the scene of your own accident.
To further improve comfort while maintaining excellent handling, the suspension has redesigned the front and rear shock absorbers as well as optimized the shape of the sleeves of the front lower levers.
The four-wheel drive system is adapted to Russian conditions.
Road and motor noise levels at high speeds have been reduced by 13%.
A bathing suit in a flower or stripe is as boring as a budget sedan.
It's a different matter if a girl flaunts in a swimsuit with an original pattern.
For example, from a computer game in the genre of role-playing action.
Then it will get no less attention than the new CX-5!
The new CX-5 has an improved design for both the front and rear seats, providing optimal space for wide shoulders and long legs - who knows what.
Even the long-legged will surely appreciate that the stops at the front of the central tunnel are now soft and do not hit the ankles in twists.
Mazda offers the widest range of active safety systems on the CX-5.
Radars, lasers, and cameras are used to detect potential threats.
There are adaptive lighting, lane departure warning, blind spot monitoring, and safe braking.
The Mazda CX-5 has one of the best trunk cases in the class.
Comfortable and with minimal protrusions, it can carry a load of 561 liters. The rear seats fold down in a 4: 2: 4 ratio - with each section equipped with a separate pull lever - and increase the luggage compartment to 1,560 liters.
The costume of the cartoon character in Japan is called "kigurumi."
Kigurumi pyjamas look especially funny.
Everything is possible in it!
Sleeping, of course.
But also to entertain young children.
Or just walk around in the street like that...
After all, it's so cool to be able to choose - cool clothes, manners, or a car.
Thank you for helping with the preparation of the material at Kawaicat.
Kyiv has torn up the atomic union.
Kyiv has formalized Ukraine's refusal to cooperate with Russia on the completion of the Khmelnytsky NPP.
On Wednesday, the Verkhovna Rada voted on the second attempt to terminate the agreement with Moscow.
Agreements on the completion of the third and fourth units were signed in 2010-2012, but it was never possible to start implementing the project.
On Wednesday, the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine adopted a law terminating an agreement concluded in 2010-2012 with the Russian Federation on the construction of the third and fourth units at the Khmelnitsky NPP.
It was possible to pass the bill submitted by the government only with a second vote, the first time it was supported by 210 deputies against the required minimum of 226, but then 234 members of parliament voted in favor of the bill in a re-vote.
The original design of the Khmelnitsky NPP, which was built during the USSR, was to have four 1 GW units with VVER-type reactors, but only two were built.
Negotiations with Moscow on the completion led to the conclusion of an intergovernmental agreement in 2010, and in 2011-2012 the Rada adopted the relevant laws.
As there were no funds in Ukraine's budget, it was supposed that the construction of the blocks would have to be financed by a loan from the Russian side, but the funds were never allocated.
After the coup in Kyiv in February 2014 and the subsequent cooling of relations between the two countries, Kyiv began curtailing relations with Moscow in the nuclear industry, announcing its refusal to cooperate on the Khmelnitsky NPP and the project to build a nuclear fuel plant in Ukraine.
The only area where relations remained intact was the purchase of fuel from the Russian Federation for Ukraine's operating nuclear power plants (which provided about half of the country's electricity generation), because, so far, Ukraine's ANCEX Energoatom has nothing to replace Russian supplies.
Plans to complete the Khmelnytsky NPP with another contractor in Ukraine have not yet been definitively abandoned: back in 2014, Kyiv announced negotiations with the Czech Skoda JS.
The UN Secretary General opposes the use of military force in resolving the Syrian conflict.
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said during a press conference that there could be no military solution to the situation in Syria.
"There is no military solution," AP quoted him as saying when asked about Russia's military support for Syria.
Ban Ki-moon also said he would meet with the foreign ministers of the permanent members of the UN Security Council on the situation in Syria.
I will meet with the foreign ministers of the permanent members of the UN Security Council later this month.
"The meeting will be on Syria," he said.
Earlier today, Deputy Chief of the General Staff of the Russian Armed Forces, Nikolai Bogdanovsky, said that the General Staff did not rule out the possibility of establishing an Air Force base in Syria in the future.
So far, there are no such plans.
"But anything can happen," Mr. Bogdanovsky said.
Earlier, Kommersant reported that the United States does not trust Russian President Vladimir Putin, who said that military assistance to official Damascus is necessary to fight the terrorist group "Islamic State," banned in Russia.
For more information about US doubts about Russian aid to Syria, read Kommersant's "Russian military presence in Syria worries Washington."
The OSCE PA reports on a possible meeting of Ukrainian and Russian parliamentarians.
Head of the Ukrainian delegation to the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly (PA), Arthur Gerasimov, announced the possibility of a bilateral meeting this year with his Russian parliamentary colleagues to discuss the situation in southeastern Ukraine.
"What I know is that a certain meeting is planned for this year, possibly between Ukrainian and Russian parliamentary delegations," TASS quotes Mr Gerasimov as saying.
He also called for fulfillment of the Minsk agreements and "a return to the normal life of our countries."
Asked whether, in his opinion, a dialogue between Ukraine and Russia is currently possible at the parliamentary level - in the "Normandy format" or in the format of a contact group at the OSCE PA site - Mr Gerasimov noted that the dialogue has been held and there are Minsk agreements.
At the same time, according to the politician, Kiev supports any kind of dialogue.
Earlier, Ukraine's representative to the talks, former President Leonid Kuchma, said that the self-proclaimed Donetsk and Luhansk republics have not changed their positions in the trilateral talks, but the tone of the dialogue has become more positive.
The parties were given mandates.
Yesterday, the election commission of Nizhny Novgorod summed up the results of the municipal elections for the City Duma, distributing 12 parliamentary seats drawn from party lists.
Traditionally, a lot of complaints about election violations came from representatives of the Communist Party, who accused the election commission of "covering up fraud."
The opposition's comments were not accepted.
At the same time, the election commission refused to allow the Communists of Russia party to organize a referendum on the abolition of fees for the renovation of apartment buildings.
The City Election Commission has officially presented the results of the elections to the City Duma of Nizhny Novgorod for the municipal constituency.
A total of 1.03 million people were registered to vote in Nizhny Novgorod, 746,700 ballot papers were issued to precinct commissions, and 268,000 voters voted in the elections.
More than 11,700 ballots were declared invalid, and 24 were declared lost.
Yesterday, 12 mandates were distributed to political parties, depending on the votes they received.
United Russia lists Dmitry Svatkovsky, Dmitry Krasnov, Vasily Shupranov, Elizaveta Solonchenko, Vyacheslav Rasteryaev, and Igor Nagorny among the six seats in the City Duma.
Liberal Democratic Party leader Vladimir Zhirinovsky received the only mandate.
The two mandates of the CPRF are distributed between Vladimir Bulanov and State Duma deputy Alexander Tarnaev.
Three Just Russia mandates go to Alexander Razumovsky, Igor Bogdanov, and Mikhail Shalyugin.
Now, within five days, these candidates must decide whether they will serve as deputies in the City Council: if he abandons his mandate, he will go to the next candidate on the party list.
Chairman of the City Election Commission, Alexander Makeev, informed the members of the commission that he was introducing duty duties to "send telegrams to Zhirinovsky and others" in order to renounce their mandates.
When approving the protocol on the election results, representatives of the CPRF claimed multiple violations.
Leonid Krasnokutsky, a CPRF member of the City Election Commission with a consultative vote, proposed not to recognize the results of voting in four districts No. 21-24, recalling that, by order of the head of Sormovsky District Administration, the entrance to the administration building, where four district commissions were located, had been closed.
Neither the deputies of Gosudma, nor the candidates themselves, nor observers could pass inside for a long time, and a high-profile scandal involving the storming of the doors of the district administration was shown on television.
All observers and commission members with an advisory vote had the opportunity to attend the meetings of district commissions.
They were denied access by the head only when the voting was over and the precinct commissions had not yet arrived to cast their ballots.
This was done in order to prevent various provocations.
"Then the head was corrected, and interested parties could attend all the meetings," said Natalia Andriushina, a member of the City Election Commission.
Communists objected that the deputy of the Legislative Assembly of the region, Lyudmila Aristova, had been illegally detained for more than four hours in the besieged administration building, about which a statement had been sent to the investigative committee.
The opposition also complained that a number of polling stations began sealing ballot boxes at 6-7 a.m. on election day, putting early voting ballots in them.
At the same time, members of the commissions with the right to advisory vote and observers were not notified, so they arrived by the beginning of the election at 8 a.m.
Communists believe that in the morning hours before the opening of polling stations, ballot papers could have been thrown into the ballot boxes unchecked.
However, Goryelecom, which has already considered more than 124 complaints on various occasions, according to Alexander Makeyev, has not found any violations with the stuffing of unregistered ballots.
The members of the commission also did not support the proposal of their Just Russia colleague Maria Popova to come out with amendments to regional legislation through the electoral commission in order to clearly set the time for opening envelopes with early voting ballots, which then end up in the ballot box.
"As a matter of your own initiative, contact at least the CEC," Alexander Makeev advised Mrs. Popova.
At the end of the meeting, CPRF member Sergei Samokhin lashed out at the chairman with loud accusations, shouting that the election commission was ignoring dozens of complaints and covering up electoral fraud.
"You are not at the rally here, be careful what you say!" the chairman of the election commission took offense.
In the end, the protocol was approved almost unanimously.
By September 27, the election commission must approve the general results of the elections, after which the first meeting of the sixth convocation of the Nizhny Novgorod City Duma will be scheduled within three weeks.
In addition to determining the results of the elections, the city election commission refused to register the Communists of Russia political party as an initiative group for holding a local referendum.
Judging by the documents, the Party members were going to submit two questions for discussion by residents of Nizhny Novgorod: whether they agree that the fees for the overhaul of apartment buildings should be "immediately abolished," and tariffs for housing and communal services "frozen until 2020."
However, Irina Maslova, a lawyer for the Duma, explained that the appeal by the Communists of Russia was contrary to the law.
FedEx revenue mixed, 2016 outlook downgraded
FedEx reported disappointing results for the last quarter, and the delivery service giant cut its full-year profit forecast due to falling demand for freight services and rising costs in its ground transportation division.
The company also said it plans to hire about 55,000 seasonal workers for the holidays.
At this time last year, FedEx said it would hire 50,000 temporary workers for the holidays.
Its shares were down about 2.5 percent in premarket trading 45 minutes before Wednesday's opening.
FedEx Corp. said it expects to earn $10.40 to $10.90 for the fiscal year ending next May, down 20 cents from its previous forecast.
Analysts had expected $10.84, according to a FactSet survey.
The downgrade comes despite a 4.9 per cent average rate hike, which will take effect on January 4, and an increase in charges for overland transport of heavy or oversized cargo, which begins in November.
The company said it still expects revenue growth year-on-year, driven by cost-cutting, higher gross revenue and growth in online sales.
Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said the company "performed well in the face of weaker-than-expected economic conditions, particularly in manufacturing and global trade."
The holiday hiring plans were announced a day after rival UPS said it planned to hire an additional 95,000 employees, roughly the same number it hired last year.
FedEx earned $692 million in the quarter ended August 31, up 6 percent from a year earlier.
Earnings per share were $2.42, close to the average of $2.44 per share forecast by Zacks Investment Research in a survey of 12 analysts.
Revenue rose 5% to $12.3 billion.
Six analysts surveyed by Zacks had expected $12.23 billion.
FedEx has suffered in recent years from the downturn in its international freight business, which has resulted in no growth in gross revenue in its express shipping division.
But the online shopping boom has dramatically improved results at FedEx Ground.
In the most recent quarter, revenue from ground transportation grew by 29%, but operating income was largely flat due to higher costs for large departures and self-insurance.
The express division received higher revenue due to higher base rates, while in the freight sector, revenue fell due to higher labor costs.
FedEx shares fell $3.85, or 2.5 percent, to $150.15 in premarket trading about an hour before the exchange opened.
They closed Tuesday down 11 percent for the year and 17 percent below their June 11 record.
At the most highly anticipated meeting in years, Fed officials will spend two days this week sitting at a 27-foot mahogany table, deciding whether it is time to raise the key interest rate for the first time in nearly a decade.
At one end of the richly decorated conference room, two floors high, a mural of the United States hangs above them.
The card is a reminder that Federal Reserve Chair Janet L. Yellen and her colleagues must put the country's economic interests first.
The central bank has received a dual mandate from Congress to maximize US employment and keep prices stable.
But since the Great Recession, Fed policymakers have recognized that there is a third, unwritten mandate: financial stability.
And that third mandate may prove an unknown factor in the near-forecasted decision to be announced Thursday on whether the US economy is ready to break away from the unprecedented stimulus provided by near-zero short-term interest rates since late 2008.
Even though most data show strong economic growth, the recent turmoil in global financial markets could deter already cautious Federal Reserve policymakers from adding volatility by raising the benchmark federal funds rate by as little as a quarter-percentage point.
"Clearly, the labor market and inflation will be the first and most important issues to be addressed," said Lindsey M. Piegza, chief economist at the brokerage Stifel Nicolaus & Co.
"But I think that if they were looking for a reason not to raise rates, the increased uncertainty around the global market is enough to give them an excuse to wait further," she said.
There is no consensus about what the Fed will do, which in itself causes financial-market volatility.
Roughly half of economists polled by Bloomberg recently predicted an interest-rate hike this week.
Financial markets, however, expect the Fed to hold back, with a key indicator showing only a roughly 30 percent chance of a rapid recovery.
This could cause the stock market to fall if the Federal Reserve raises rates, provided policymakers do not soften the blow by promising that the next hike will not come soon.
On Tuesday, the Dow rose 228.89 points, or 1.4%, to 16,599.85.
The surge was fueled by expectations that policymakers at the Federal Reserve will leave rates this week, said John Lonski, chief economist at Moody's Capital Markets Research.
"It would be a surprise if the Federal Reserve were to raise rates at this point in time," he said.
If the Fed's leadership does so, "they will have to go a long way in validating their strategy to keep financial markets in their hands so that they don't panic."
Other experts countered that a rate hike could calm financial markets, as it would remove uncertainty about how the Federal Reserve would operate.
Just a month ago, the Federal Reserve seemed poised to raise rates by 0.25% this month, taking the first small step in a slow tightening of financial conditions that could confirm the strength of the US recovery.
Yellen said in the spring and early summer that she expected a rate hike this year, despite complaints from liberals that more economic progress was needed.
Although job creation slowed in August, labor-market growth has been steady this year.
Unemployment fell to 5.1% last month, the lowest rate in more than seven years, and close to what the federal system considers full employment.
Wage growth is showing signs of accelerating.
And, while inflation remains below the central bank's 2% annual target, Fed officials said the temporary effect of the sharp drop in oil prices was a key cause.
The economy "can cope with higher rates and needs them, given the shrinking labor market," said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.
But financial markets around the world began to shake late last month, after China devalued its currency.
The Dow Jones industrial average fell as much as 16% from its all-time high in May, as investors worried that a slowdown in the Chinese economy could stifle global growth.
The market has recovered some ground this month, and the Dow is now about 10% below its May high.
For Fed officials, market outrage further complicates difficult calculations about the timing of an interest-rate hike.
"In the absence of information about what happened in financial markets and news about the weakness of the Chinese economy in the last few weeks, they would have tightened the screws on this meeting," said Stephen D. Aliner, a senior fellow at the UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate and a former Federal Reserve official.
Now, he predicts, they will wait at least a month to gain more control over the consequences.
"There is a lot of uncertainty about what the consequences might be for the US economy, and they have very little hard data after the recent events in China," Aliner said.
The health of the global economy is not at the heart of the Federal System's concerns, and it should not technically be factored into these decisions.
But the Federal Reserve has essentially become the world's financial power.
The central bank's influence in recent years has been enormous.
The mere hint from then-Chairman Ben S. Bernanke in 2013 that the Federal Reserve might "dampen" its monetary expansion sent shockwaves through markets around the world.
In a world where markets and economies are increasingly intertwined, one would expect Fed policymakers not only to monitor developments everywhere, but also to consult with representatives of other central banks and experts to gain a better understanding of the global economy.
Their decision-making process is "more of an art than a science," said Zachary Carabell, chief executive of Envestnet Inc, a global wealth management company.
Jeffrey Lacker, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, Virginia, noted this month that "there have been instances in the history of the Federal Reserve system of over-reaction to financial market movements that seem unrelated to economic principles."
Lacker, a voting member of the influential Federal Open Market Committee who pushed for a rate hike, cited the 1998-99 decisions as an example.
The financial crisis in Asia led the Federal Reserve to cut its benchmark rate by 0.75% in three meetings, "despite limited identifiable effects on US growth," Lacker said.
A year later, Federal Reserve officials reversed those cuts.
The Fed should put stability first only in times of major crises, such as the 2008 market crash, "said Adam S. Posen, a former member of the Bank of England's interest-rate setting committee.
The latest panic has not come close to that level, he said.
"You certainly wouldn't want to be in a situation where you're scared to raise rates because markets are shaking," said Posen, president of the Peterson Institute for World Economics.
The Federal Reserve Act still has a dual mandate and does not mention financial stability, and until that changes, I don't think they should get ahead of themselves.
Need a great Thai market?
Try LAX-C in Chinatown.
Yes, Chinatown
The market / warehouse opened in 1997 and is owned by LAX-C Inc.
Often called Thailand's Costco, LAX-C is a wholesale Thai market that also trades for the public.
Yes, he's in Chinatown, not Ty Town.
A market / warehouse is a shop where you can buy everything at once, offering a dizzying selection of fresh, frozen and dried foods, popular Thai and Asian snacks, kitchen utensils, furniture, religious and holiday decorations.
There is even a car department if you need to buy engine oil.
The store is huge, and it will take more than an hour to comb through all the rows.
If shopping makes you hungry, buy food at LAX-C BBQ Express.
The in-store cooking department (good and inexpensive) is close to the cash registers and offers a variety of takeaway options.
What's on offer: Need something - anything - Thai?
LAX-C probably does.
Commodity prices are reasonable, and quite a few goods are sold in bulk.
Fresh produce includes gourmet Asian and local Thai herbs, fruits and much more.
The meat counter is as varied as the fish counter - the staff behind the counter will clean and disassemble the fish, and even fry it for you if you like.
A considerable part of the store is given over to an impressive freezer, where you will find frozen curry leaves, bitter pumpkin and galangal, whole ducks, fish, beef blood and bile, pork carcasses, caviar, local sausages, semi-processed foods and much more.
Who buys there: Restaurant owners and chefs, as well as families and individual buyers.
There are shopping carts and forklifts in the wide aisle.
Finding: Fresh durian montong near the exit.
Where to be found: The store is located in the industrial part of Los Angeles, adjacent to the Chinatown suburb and downtown, a few blocks from Philippe The Original.
Parking: LAX-C has its own parking lot, which it shares with other shops and restaurants.
Although the store can be crowded, parking is usually easy to find.
State Duma Speaker Sergei Naryshkin admits that the US is deliberately destabilizing the situation in the Middle East so that waves of refugees will flood into Europe.
Interfax reports that he expressed this opinion to journalists in Ulaanbaatar within the framework of the autumn session of the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly.
"I am not a conspiracy theorist, but the question arises: is Europe the ultimate goal of those who have destabilized North Africa and the Middle East with such manic persistence in recent years?" he asked.
"After all, surely someone assumed and knew that the flows of refugees, these unfortunate and destitute people who are fleeing death, would go to the well-to-do EU countries," he added.
Naryshkin asked: "How many of Europe's political leaders have spoken frankly about the causes of this crisis, this wave of refugees that is now literally flooding their countries?"
"No, old Europe, with rare exceptions, prefers to remain silent," he stated.
According to Naryshkin, NATO flouts many European values and norms of international law.
"Unfortunately, Europe has long and impartially watched and is watching how the moral ideals and basic fundamental principles and norms of international law are trampled by a military boot sewn up according to NATO standards," the speaker emphasized.
Government troops and loyalist militias are being confronted by rebels made up mostly of Islamists.
Later, the terrorist group Islamic State, banned in Russia, joined the Syrian government's opponents.
The US supports rebels who oppose both Assad and IS.
Official Damascus considers such rebels terrorists.
Syria's president has cited the West's aversion to Russia as the reason.
The West's claim against countries like Syria, Russia, and Iran is that they are sovereign states.
This opinion was expressed by Syrian President Bashar al-Assad in an interview with RT, Channel One, Rossiya 24, NTV, Rossiya Segodnya, TASS, Interfax, and Rossiyskaya Gazeta.
According to Assad, the West does not perceive partners and sovereign states.
In these countries, he would like to remove one person and put in his place another, who will act in the interests of Western countries, not in the interests of his homeland, he said.
Assad drew attention to the sharp reversal of the Western media since the beginning of the coup in Ukraine.
For them, he said, Russian President Vladimir Putin "has gone from being a friend of the West to an enemy, a tsar, a dictator who suppresses the Russian opposition, who came to power in an undemocratic way, even though he was elected in democratic elections recognized in the West."
Putin called on the world community to join forces with Assad to fight the Islamic State.
Commenting on the West's constant statements that Assad himself must leave, he noted that the president comes to power with the consent of the people, through elections, and if he leaves - at the request of the people, not by decision of the United States, the UN Security Council, the Geneva Conference or the Geneva Communiqué.
"If the people want him to stay, the president stays, otherwise he should leave immediately," he said.
Assad called Russia and Iran friendly countries and recalled their cooperation.
Syria is also fighting terrorism with neighboring Iraq.
Referring to Iran's military support, the Syrian leader noted that the country supports the Syrian state politically, economically, and militarily.
He denied allegations that Iranian military units were being sent to Syria.
Tehran supplies us with military equipment.
"Of course, there is an exchange of military experts between Syria and Iran, but this exchange has always taken place," he explained.
As for the other states, we are open to cooperation with any of them if there is a serious will to fight terrorism.
"We do not see this in the case of the so-called anti-terrorist and anti-ISIS coalition led by the United States," Assad said.
The number of dead exceeded 230,000 people, and the number of refugees - 11.5 million.
Part of the territory was captured by the terrorist group Islamic State, which is banned in Russia.
The US-led international coalition is carrying out air strikes against IS positions.

The youngest of the victims was four years old.
All of the dead were residents of the Colorado City and Hildale areas that were hit by the storm.
Three children were also reported rescued.

Lavrov, Kerry discuss situation in Syria: Politics: World: Lenta.ru
US Secretary of State John Kerry held a telephone conversation with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov.
This was reported by Reuters, with reference to State Department spokesman John Kirby.
It is noted that the topic of the conversation was the conflict in Syria.
Kirby, however, provided no further details.
At the same time, he said that the US has the tools to "further isolate Russia" if it supports Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, RIA Novosti reports.
According to the Russian Foreign Ministry, Lavrov, in the course of his conversation with Kerry, again emphasized the need to create a united front against the terrorist groups operating in the territory of this country.
Ways to resolve the Ukrainian crisis and possible steps to reduce tensions on the Korean Peninsula were also discussed.
In addition, some bilateral issues were raised.
Earlier, US officials said that Russia was building up its military presence in Syria, and expressed concern about Moscow's increasing support for Assad.
Washington has said that if Russia continues to support Assad, it will become even more isolated from the international community.
In response, Russian President's spokesman Dmitry Peskov said that the country would not be internationally isolated.
The rebels want to overthrow the Assad regime.
Part of the territory has been captured by the Islamic State terrorist organization.
The US-led international coalition is carrying out air strikes on IS positions.
Borodai called the American newspaper's information a slander against Strelkov.
The former chairman of the government of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People's Republic, Alexander Borodai, denied the information, which was published in the American newspaper The Washington Post.
He stated this in a telephone interview with the correspondent of "Lenty.ru."
The Washington Post's story is beautiful because it's all completely perverse.
Of course, no one connected with former DPR Defense Minister Igor Strelkov and "left" the territory of the Donbass republics in a very high mood, without ropes, without three piles of money, which are attributed to him by different characters, "he noted.
According to Borodai, the conversation with a reporter from an American newspaper did refer to Strelkov.
"Yes, I said that Strelkov urgently needed to be removed from the territory of the Donetsk People's Republic," said the former head of the government of the Donetsk People's Republic.
Borodai stressed that he did not know why the correspondent of an American publication decided to write that Strelkov had been taken to the territory of Russia "bound."
I suspect that this is a provocation.
If this is not a provocation, then it is surprisingly misunderstood words, because I emphasized that Strelkov left on his own, "Borodai noted.
"This is a slander on me and Strelkov," he concluded.
Earlier, The Washington Post published an article in which Borodai was quoted as saying that he had taken Strelkov to Russia by force.
According to the publication, Borodai noted that he was forced to tie up his associate.
Polish authorities have launched a search for a train carrying the gold of the Nazis.
Polish lumberjacks have begun cutting down trees above the underground tunnel where, according to some reports, a train carrying Third Reich gold is located.
Work began on Tuesday, September 15, Reuters reports.
According to military experts, clearing the forest is necessary in order to verify the veracity of rumors about the train with treasures.
Inside the train, weapons and precious minerals can be found.
On August 31, the governor of Poland's Lower Silesian Voivodeship, Tomasz Smolarz, suggested that the new evidence of the gold train was no more convincing than previous ones.
However, the authorities decided to cordon off the search area.
Three days earlier, Poland's deputy culture minister, Piotr Zuchowski, said that local treasure hunters had found, with a "99 per cent probability," the very train with Third Reich gold mentioned in the legend.
Zhukhovsky noted that if the assumptions are confirmed and the jewels are discovered, they will become the property of the state treasury, without the treasures being handed over to Russia.
In mid-August, two clients of a law firm contacted the authorities of the Polish city of Walbrzych with a report that they had found a train in a buried tunnel 70 metres below sea level.
The chief narcologist of the Russian Federation has proposed to ban the sale of tobacco to persons under the age of 21.
Russia's chief narcologist has proposed banning the sale of tobacco before the age of 21.
Evgeny Bryun noted that up to this age, "any psychoactive substance - tobacco, alcohol, narcotics - is particularly harmful."
He said this in a live broadcast on the radio station "Moscow Speaks," commenting on the information that the Speaker of the Council of the Federal Federation, Valentina Matvienko, supported the idea of banning the sale of alcohol to citizens under the age of 21.
Man matures unevenly.
It is possible to serve in the army from the age of 18, a person is physically ready for it.
Mentally, he is ready for a full life in society from the age of 21.
"It is known from scientific data that the brain, its biochemistry, does not fully mature until the age of 21," said Brune.
Earlier, Sultan Khamzaev, a member of the Public Chamber and head of the Sober Russia project, told Izvestia that Matvienko supported the initiative to raise the age limit for the sale of alcohol and "agreed, together with the Public Chamber, to raise the issue again on the platform of the upper chamber of parliament."
According to the activist, a working group will soon be created in the Federation Council to develop the bill under the leadership of Matvienko.
The Bible was asked to be checked for compliance with the law on information protection of children
A resident of Novosibirsk appealed to the regional prosecutor's office with a request to check the Bible for compliance with the federal law "On the protection of children from information harmful to their health and development," a Sib.f. correspondent read the statement on September 16.
The author of the appeal stated that on August 26, 2015, he purchased a Bible published in 2013 by the Russian Bible Society from the "Read-City" store on Krasny Prospekt.
In the text of the book, he found fragments that, in his opinion, violate the Federal Law "On the Protection of Children from Information Harmful to their Health and Development."
On September 16, the application was accepted for consideration by the Prosecutor's Office of Novosibirsk.
A response to the appeal from a resident of Novosibirsk will be received within 30 days.
The point is not to ban the book.
It is much more interesting to show the absurdity of the law itself, - commented the applicant to the correspondent of Sib.f.
Moreover, it is a well-founded problem that will shake up society.
It will start to reread the Bible, which it has not done before.
Brazilian Union of Pediatricians Rio Grande promotes healthy nutrition for breast-feeding
The Brazilian paediatric organization SPRS has come up with a scandalous method by which it is going to convince women of the need for proper nutrition during breastfeeding: the method involves the display of images of babies sucking their breasts, painted with images of unhealthy food.
Breast milk contains various proteins, fats, vitamins, and carbohydrates, from which children receive all the nutrients they need to form a strong immune system.
Because of their high energy needs, pregnant women and women who have given birth are advised to increase their daily calorie intake by about 500 calories per day.
However, a recent study shows that increasing calories alone is not the only dietary change mothers should make.
A recent study by Robert Waterland, a professor at Baylor College of Medicine in Texas, found that a healthy diet for pregnant women actually affects gene expression in children and prevents them from developing tumors.
Unfortunately, the negative impact of unhealthy diets on a child's immune system has been revealed.
A school bus was rammed by a train near Hamburg.
Near Hamburg, a train crashed into a school bus that was stuck on a railway track.
The 23-year-old female driver, realizing she couldn't derail, ordered 60 students out of the vehicle.
A minute later, they collided in front of their eyes.
It was captured on video by one of the schoolchildren.
As a result of the accident, there was panic among students.
Some children started crying and running along the roadside.
The route remains blocked.
Miraculously, no one was injured, except one passenger on the train who suffered minor injuries, police said.
Damage from the accident was estimated at 300 thousand euros.
Doctors are calling for a ban on boxing.
The leadership of the Australian Medical Association (AMA) has called for boxing to be banned in the country following the death of local athlete David Brown Jr.
On Monday, Brown, 28, died from injuries sustained in a fight with Filipino Carlo Magali.
The fight for one of the regional titles according to the International Boxing Federation (IBF) in the weight category up to 57.15 kg, which took place on Friday, ended with Magali's victory by knockout in the 12th round.
Brown ended up in hospital with a head injury.
His condition was assessed as critical and he was put on life support.
On a professional ring Brown gained 22 victories, suffered only two defeats and one fight ended in a draw.
He is survived by two children.
It is the second fatality among Australian boxers in the past six months.
In March, 23-year-old student Braydon Smith died from injuries sustained in the ring.
The AMA is now recommending that the sport be discontinued, rather than banned altogether.
"I understand that this is unintentional," said Stephen Parnis, the organization's vice president.
But, as boxing is now, there will always be those situations where an athlete has a brain haemorrhage or injury that results in either death or serious injury.
For this reason, the AMA believes that we cannot continue to live with it.
The Australian Medical Association is an independent professional body of medical practitioners and medical students.
Sergei Naryshkin called on the OSCE PA to lift sanctions against Russian parliamentarians.
Speaker of the State Duma of the Russian Federation Sergei Naryshkin called the introduction of sanctions against parliamentarians inadmissible.
He stated this addressing a session of the OSCE PA in Ulaanbaatar.
We regard this as an unacceptable act, an attack on the values of parliamentary diplomacy.
"And this should not be repeated, because it is a manifestation of political shamelessness and disregard for the principles of open international dialogue," the politician said.
In addition, Naryshkin called on the OSCE PA participants to restore the partnership between Russia and the EU.
Let us bring morality back into politics.
Let us put dialogue and law back into the practice of international communication.
Let us return humanist ideals to a democratic world order.
"The duplicity never ended well," he said.
Speaking from the rostrum of the Parliamentary Assembly, the Speaker of the Russian State Duma called on parliamentarians to convene an inter-parliamentary contact group on Ukraine.
I encourage Assembly members to focus on the following specific security challenges.
"First, a negotiated solution to the Ukrainian crisis and the immediate convening of our inter-parliamentary group," Naryshkin said.
He also noted that the OSCE should be given credit.
"This is almost the only common platform where they are still discussing how to normalize the situation in Ukraine," the politician stressed.
Recall that the autumn session of the Parliamentary Assembly opened on Tuesday, September 15, in Ulaanbaatar and will last until September 18.
Enjoyed the victory for a couple of days.
World champion in track and field Sergei Shubenkov.
This season can be called triumphant for the 24-year-old athlete from Barnaul, Sergei SHUBENKOV.
He managed to win the 110 meters hurdles crown at the European Team Championships, set several records, and most importantly - to become the world champion, and the first in the history of the domestic barrier sprint.
In addition, the athlete recently won the final stage of the Diamond League, finishing third overall.
Novye Izvestia asked Shubenkov to share his impressions of the expiring season.
Sergey, isn't the season over for you yet?
Yes, I am going to compete at the World Military Games, which will be held in Korea in October, and then I will think about rest.
However, now I will prepare at home, in Barnaul, and to be at home - it is after all absolutely another condition.
It's easier than going around the world every week.
You once said that autumn is your favorite time of year.
The end of August and the beginning of September are great times.
Passions after the main start of the season boiled over, the burden of responsibility is no longer pressing.
It is possible to compete in pleasure, on "relaxation."
Plus you know that the vacation is coming very soon...
Is there fatigue?
After all, the season is special, a lot of positive emotions...
Fatigue towards the end of the season always builds up.
It doesn't matter if I did more - I won or I lost.
Every competition is stressful.
Constant flights, transfers - all this does not pass for the body without a trace.
You get tired physically and emotionally.
But now, of course, emotions are on the rise.
I'm just happy there.
Do you come back often by the time you finish at the World Championships in Beijing?
It happens.
And you journalists don't let me forget it.
But, in general, I think it is bad that an athlete who lives on the old victories, scrolls his successful races over and over again.
I enjoyed the victory for a couple of days - and I have to move on.
Has the build-up to this great season been very different?
I can't say there was anything so special.
We started preparing in December, but I missed the winter competitive season.
I trained at first at home in Barnaul, then at training camps, then again at home.
It's business as usual.
But with the coach we set the task: to try to reach a new level, which I haven't been to yet.
Almost all of the winter time was spent laying the groundwork.
We ran a lot of crosses, did all-physical training, which included traction, squats, and we pumped our back.
Then we started barrier training, we did a lot of technical work.
Did you keep an eye on how your rivals perform?
I always try to do it, but in the age of the Internet there is no problem with it.
I watched the European Winter Championships, and there in the barrier sprint the entire podium was taken by the French!
I thought: we need to do something, dilute this company.
With every start this season you have added and added to the results.
Did that give you confidence?
For me, the last few seasons have all followed a similar pattern.
There is no such thing as me running first 13.20 and then 13.50.
I always unwind my form gradually.
The main thing I wanted to do was run out of 13 seconds.
All the work was directed first and foremost at this result.
But the paradox is that you seem to feel that you are ready for feats, and it does not always turn out to be possible to show your readiness at competitions.
What was it like at the London Olympics, for example?
To be honest, I tried to forget that semi-final run (Shubenkov could not qualify for the final. - "NI") at once.
I was ready very well, I could actually run out of 13 seconds.
Even if I had repeated my best result at that time, I would have won the bronze medal at the Games.
But it was unlucky.
Remember your first World Cup?
How about that?
In Daegu, it was.
I really wanted to get into the final, there was such a program-maximum.
And fell right off the track, in the preliminary races.
That's when I realized that to vomit and run around with your head down is to run nowhere at all.
Two years later, at the World Championships in Moscow, he reached the final with the best time.
I remember well my feelings before the decisive race: I really wanted to win the "gold" back then!
How is it possible, while developing a decent speed, not to lose your head, not to switch off?
And that is the most difficult thing.
You have to be very careful, focused on technique, not to fall down barriers.
I noticed that when you tune in not to the result, but to the process, it is much easier.
And the buzz when you have the feeling that you are running and everything seems to work out!
Honestly, it's worth it.
Many of our athletes from the hinterland, after their first serious successes, aspire to move closer to the capital.
Never had such thoughts?
Homes are still better.
And I have no idea where I am without my coach, who needs me?
It might be nice to have better conditions, but I try to be happy with what I have.
Have you been together with Klevtsov for a long time?
From the age of 12, since I came to athletics.
To be precise, first I trained with his wife, who worked with children, and then she handed me over.
I started with the sprint, then the long jump, the triple jump.
Children's all-around was - it's when they throw a ball, jump in the long jump from their place...
I tried hurdles at 14 and I loved it.
From the first run, it was possible to fulfill the standard of the second adult category.
And so it has remained.
Never had a fear of barriers?
Somehow, it worked out right away.
But we always had to work very hard on the technique.
Over one run, he was in a lot of pain!
But there is no getting away from this routine.
The technique needs to be honed constantly - so that at night I can be woken up, I would immediately get up and run over the barriers.
Everyone who saw your race in Beijing says it was a very beautiful race.
Thank you.
I liked myself.
Normally I don't review my races, but here I couldn't resist.
But efficiency needs to be further developed - there are no limits to perfection.
Don't you fear now that victory a year before the Olympics will carry a heavy burden on your shoulders?
As they say in such cases, I will try to meet expectations.
Once you have chosen this path, you must go all the way.
My coach likes to repeat: if you're not weak, you shouldn't feel any extra pressure.
I absolutely agree with him on this.
Otar Kushanashvili
Well, I am not so naive as to be taken aback by the reaction to the interview that took place in Ukraine.
People are angry, I understand, don't feed them bread - give it to the enemy.
Although I did not wrap myself in a flag, and said exactly the same thing a million times here, and did not call anyone a bastard directly, I was touched by something else.
All my pseudo-friends evaporated in a second.
The pressure I am under is so intense that even I, who have seen the kind of guys, think people are whitewashed.
It was as if you were walking, walking, and you were attacked by a mob and mutilated with rods.
But you have to know me, I'm not a room eagle, I'm punched, I'm hit with a howitzer, I'm old, guys, I'm afraid.
No support is another matter.
I had no illusions, but now...
The best thing about me has always been self-sufficiency, so take a bite.
Only morons can give passports to freaks like Fred Durst or Monson.
It would be better for me, the best journalist, to do an unashamed job.
A week ago in Kyiv, Otar Kushanashvili sharply characterized the Crimean events:
What was done to the Crimean peninsula is a crime.
This is what is called annexation.
I believe that the reference to how a drunk Khrushchev tried to sign something does not in any way fit into the general picture of human cohabitation.
It's like coming to a neighbor and taking away his living space...
The war from the Kremlin has gone, and it will end only there.
I am almost 100% sure that, as in the summer of 2008, it began with a call from some bastard in the Kremlin.
I have a hunch who it might have been...
Kobzon doesn't have much left to live for.
I don't understand, he is the greatest artist, why he needs to lick Putin's hands.
Is he going to lose his apartment?
Well, they demolished a monument to him.
Of course, people remember him for insulting his small homeland.
Reconciliation now depends only on Vladimir Vladimirovich.
Seventh's Sunrise tops the ratings despite Nine's attempts to cover the leaders' loss on the Today Show
Karl Stefanovic and Lisa Wilkinson's foray into Canberra to cover the fallout from the Liberal Party's leadership bid has failed to boost Today's ratings much.
Nine's morning show was broadcast from the nation's capital after Malcolm Turnbull defeated Tony Abbott.
A competitor, Sunrise, with hosts David Koch and Samantha Armytage, is stuck in London as part of a week-long international series that also includes Dubai, New York, Niagara Falls and Cancun.
That distance torture didn't seem to matter much to Australian viewers, with Sunrise's audience of 397,000 in the five biggest cities compared to Today's audience of 339,000.
Today gained slightly more than its ratings on Monday (317,000) and last Tuesday (283,000), but its figure was worse than last Thursday (343,000).
Today has been closing the gap with Sunrise in recent months.
In August, Today had 318,000, compared to Sunrise's 330,000.
At the beginning of the year, the gap ranged between 40,000 and 50,000.
So far in September, Sunrise has 349,000 viewers compared to 314,000 for Today.
This is the most interesting thing that has happened all morning.
Winds of change are affecting more than Parliament this morning, guys!
Karl and Lisa are fine, thanks for the clarification!
Published by TODAY on Monday, September 14, 2015.
The big news for Seventh was the stunning debut of 800 Words with former Packed to the Rafters star Eric Thomson.
The new drama about a recently widowed father who decides to move to New Zealand on the coast with his two children has attracted an impressive 1.219 million viewers.
Critics have speculated whether Thomson can cope with the popular show alone, without Rafters star Rebecca Gibney.
The result last night was a resounding "yes."
Seventh's X Factor remained in strong position with an audience of 1.136 million viewers, easily beating The Block (838,000) and TBL Families (726,000).
It was a mixture of luck and failure for Sevens on the second night of the Chase Australia.
The first half-hour (from 5: 00 p.m. to 5: 30 p.m.) of the new TV quiz, hosted by Andrew O'Keefe, drew 446,000 viewers.
The second half-hour (5: 30 p.m. to 6 p.m.) jumped to 623,000 viewers - enough for a small victory over Eddie McGwire's Hot Seat (613,000).
On Monday night, the first half-hour of the Chase Australia attracted 520,000 viewers and the second half-hour attracted an overwhelming 720,000.
Hot Seat attracted 620,000.
Falling ratings for Chase Australia on the second night will force Nine to quietly admit that Hot Seat will still dominate at 5.30am.
Chase Australia is the replacement for Million Dollar Minute, which failed to beat McGwire's show.

The three finalists are unanimous that The Bachelor's Sam Wood is the perfect guy, but who will he choose?
The secret revealed?...
Lana Jevon-Fellowes, Sarah McKay and Snezana Markoski may have accidentally let it be known which of them will win The Bachelor.
The woman with whom Sam Wood will end up staying on The Bachelor is surrounded by a veil of mystery.
And the three girls who made it to the final have, of course, remained silent about which of them received his last rose.
But when we met Sarah McKay, Snezana Markoski and Lana Jeavons-Fellows on the eve of the day when two of the three girls are due, they may have inadvertently given a clue about the winner.
Sam Wood has remained steadfastly silent until the final on Thursday
All three women wax lyrical about why Wood is the perfect man, citing his sense of humor, commitment, family values, and cheerfulness as reasons why each of them would be happy to be his companion.
But their answers to the question, "If not you, who should get Wood's last rose?," could unwittingly suggest which of them actually won the heart of The Bachelor.
Javons-Fellows and Markoski no doubt identified McKay as the perfect pair for Wood.
Sarah and Sam had a good relationship from day one.
"From the moment I joined the show, I felt the energy of (Sarah) and Sam and knew they were very suited to each other, and throughout the show I had no doubt about that," Jevons-Fellows said.
"Sarah is a very open person, easy and fun to deal with," Markoski added.
I saw them together, there really is an attraction between them.
They feel great and comfortable with each other.
Sarah McKay thinks she and Sam Wood will make a great couple.
McKay herself said that through home visits last week, she realized that Wood might be "that person."
"As soon as I saw him among my friends and family, I knew it wasn't just a game - I believed him wholeheartedly," she says.
When asked who Voodoo should pick if it wasn't her, she replied mysteriously.
"I don't know if I can talk about it," she said.
I like both girls equally and Snezana and Lana deserve it equally.
The Bachelor airs on Wednesday at 7.30pm on Channel Ten.

Jarryd Hayne had several options to start his NFL career.
Detroit and Seattle have been keen on him since his move to the US - as have a host of other clubs who have made enquiries after an impressive open training day late last year.
But Hayne chose the San Francisco 49ers and coach Jim Tomsula and it seems to have been a wise decision.
Some coaches would have left Hayne on the bench for the rest of the game for losing the ball that the former Australian rugby league player allowed on the punt's first return in a 20-3 victory over Minnesota.
But Tomsula believed in his player and gave Hayne another opportunity to get the punt back and got him playing after Reggie Bush's injury.
Tomsula did well in the dressing room after the game.
Instead of giving a pep talk to the newcomers in the presence of the team, he encouraged them.
Tomsula also publicly backed Hayne in his post-match press conference.
49ers special reporter Cam Inman said Hayne also received support from special teams coordinator Thomas McGoy, who advised him to forget about the lost ball and think about the next game.
Jarryd Hayne lost the ball on a punt return by the Minnesota Vikings during the first quarter
Hayne and his many Australian fans clearly did not expect this to be the start of his NHL debut.
Hayne was seen swearing as he left the field after losing the ball, and later told hosts of Australian radio station 2DayFM's Hamish and Andy show that he could not have imagined a worse start to his NFL career.
"It happens, you just think about the next game and everything," Hayne said.
Hayne compared his miss to his Origin series debut in 2007, when a throw of the ball in his own area brought a try to Queensland.
In the end, the 27-year-old benefited from the experience.
Hayne took a photo with the Australian flag and fans after the game and posted it to Instagram.
Elton John and Russian President Vladimir Putin to meet to discuss gay rights
In 2003, Mikhail Khodorkovsky, Russia's richest man, was arrested at gunpoint at a Siberian airport.
An outspoken challenge to President Vladimir Putin, Khodorkovsky was convicted, his oil company, Yukos, was confiscated, and his efforts to promote democracy were thwarted.
Migrants have clashed with police at the Hungarian border.
Refugees staged protests on the Serbian border near the Hungarian town of Reske, which escalated into clashes with law enforcement.
As a result, Hungarian police used water cannons and tear gas, Reuters reports.
Migrants throw stones at police and try to tear down the border fence.
Reinforcements have been sent to the scene of the clashes, and police are responding to aggressive actions by migrants and their attempts to breach the border.
According to Agence France-Presse, the refugees managed to break through a police cordon, after which dozens of migrants fled into Hungary.
Some refugees leave the Serbian-Hungarian border by bus to Belgrade and the border with Croatia, the BBC reports.
The authorities allowed the migrants to enter Croatian territory and transport them from there to the country of their choice.
According to Hungarian authorities, 20 police officers were injured.
On September 15, Hungary's parliament tightened legislation on migration and border protection.
The amendments provide for the participation of the army in the protection of State borders, the prosecution of those who cross the border illegally, and an expedited procedure for processing asylum applications.
A Hungarian court has already convicted one migrant of illegally crossing the Hungarian-Serbian border, and he will be deported and unable to return to Hungary for one year.
In addition, the Hungarian Parliament is about to consider the transfer of responsibility for border protection to the Hungarian armed forces.
At the end of June, Hungarian authorities began building a 175-kilometre-long barbed-wire fence on the border with Serbia to stem the flow of migrants and refugees into the country.
A Russian man has admitted to carrying out the largest cyber attack in US history.
Accused in the largest cyber attack in the history of the United States, Russian Vladimir Drinkman admitted to stealing more than 160 million credit card numbers, Reuters reports.
During his trial in federal court in New Jersey, Drinkman pleaded guilty to conspiracy to gain unauthorized access to computer systems and to commit fraud.
During the meeting, the Russian spoke about collusion with three Russian citizens and a Ukrainian citizen, who are accused of cyber attacks on 15 companies.
The total damages from the actions of the defendants were estimated at $300 million.
"Defendants like Vladimir Drinkman, who have the skills to hack into our computer networks, pose a threat to our economic well-being, privacy, and national security," said U.S. Attorney Paul Fishman.
Drinkman faces 30 years in prison and a $1 million fine.
When passing sentence, the court will take into account the confessions of the Russian and, possibly, reduce his sentence.
Drinkman will be sentenced on January 15.
Vladimir Drinkman was arrested in the Netherlands in 2012.
At the same time, another suspect, Dmitry Smilyanets, was taken into custody.
The latter denies the charges against him.
Kerry warned Lavrov of the risk of Russian support for Bashar al-Assad's regime.
During a telephone conversation with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, US Secretary of State John Kerry warned that Russia's support for Syrian President Bashar al-Assad was exacerbating the conflict in the country.
"Secretary Kerry has made it clear that Russia's support for President Assad risks exacerbating and widening the conflict, as well as undermining our shared goal of fighting extremism, if we do not focus on finding a solution to the conflict in Syria through an effective political transition of power," the State Department said in a statement posted on its website.
Kerry reaffirmed the US commitment to fighting the Islamic State group (banned in Russia by the Supreme Court) as part of a coalition of more than 60 states.
According to the Secretary of State, Assad "can never be a reliable member" of the coalition.
Kerry also stressed in a telephone conversation that the conflict in Syria can be resolved only through a political transition away from Assad.
The White House has threatened Russia with isolation because of its support for the Assad regime.
The day before, White House Press Secretary Joshua Earnest threatened Russia with isolation if it did not stop supporting Assad.
As an alternative, Earnest offered to join an international coalition that is conducting an anti-terrorist operation against the Islamic State.
Recently, the media have often reported the presence of Russian troops in Syria.
To which Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov replied that Russian soldiers have been in Syria for many years and are helping Syrians master equipment to use it against the Islamists.
Four killed as police fire rubber bullets at protesters in Nepal
Four people, including a 4-year-old boy, were killed in southern Nepal when police fired rubber bullets into a crowd protesting the country's proposed new constitution, an official said Wednesday.
The violence occurred Tuesday evening in Rupandei district, about 175 miles west of Kathmandu, the country's capital.
Bishnu Prasad Dakal, the district police chief, said more than 1,000 protesters had gathered outside a police station, some throwing stones and firebombs.
Mr. Dakal said that the police used tear gas, then fired in the air before firing rubber bullets.
Twenty police officers and five civilians were wounded, he said.
It is not clear why rubber bullets, which are known to kill, but have traditionally been used as a less lethal alternative, have caused such a high death toll.
The clash was the latest in weeks of violent protests in Nepal's southern plains, where Madezis say the new provinces created by the new constitution will diminish their political influence.
Protests have also taken place in western Nepal among Taru citizens who want their own state.
At least 40 people, including eleven police officers, have been killed in violent clashes since
August, when the four main political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces, a decisive step toward a new constitution but a highly contentious issue in Nepal, which has been centrally administered for centuries.
Work on a new constitution has been underway since 2008, but lawmakers accelerated the process after a devastating earthquake killed thousands in April.
Lawmakers voted on articles of the draft constitution in Kathmandu this week, and officials said a new chapter would be signed by Sunday.
Sayansk plans to create a 900-job enterprise.
Sayansk is the youngest city in Irkutsk Oblast.
It was built in the 1970 "s as the center of the chemical industry and has a well-developed infrastructure that requires systemic support.
A year ago, Sayansk was headed by a new mayor, Oleg Borovsky.
He told the correspondent of "Oblast" about the results of the first year of work, about new projects and prospects.
Oleg Valeryevich, how did you start your work as mayor?
First of all, I got acquainted with the results of audits of financial and economic activity, initiated an independent audit of local budget spending.
Then an audit of municipal property was carried out.
One of the first practical steps was to reduce the workflow to five days.
Previously, documents could go through the courts for months.
Measures have been developed to improve the revenue base and optimize costs.
Last November, a visiting session of the government was held in Sayansk, where issues of social and economic development of the territory were discussed.
The city had no design and estimate documentation (DCP) for any project.
Without it, Sayansk could not participate in federal programs.
We started by preparing estimates for roads, a kindergarten, a northern sewer and a water pipe.
Currently, roadworks on two sections are already underway.
How is the decree of the President of the Russian Federation on the construction of kindergartens implemented in the city?
In July of this year, 105 babies were born in Sayansk.
Such positive demographics have not been observed in the city for the last 27 years.
So the issue of the availability of places in kindergartens is one of the most urgent today.
Since September 1, kindergarten No. 10, designed for 320 children, has been closed for major repairs.
The estimated cost of repair is 86 million roubles.
So far, the city has never received such funds.
Last year, after renovation, kindergarten No. 23 opened, which is now attended by 200 children.
The repair was co-financed by the regional and local budgets and cost more than 67 million roubles.
Thanks to the efforts of the administration and the assistance of the regional government, funds were raised for the purchase of furniture and equipment, and the "People's Initiatives" program also helped.
There are plans to start construction of a new kindergarten in 2016.
With its introduction, we plan to eliminate the queue of children aged 18 months to three years.
We don't have queues for children aged three to seven.
Are investors interested in the territory?
We have a clear understanding that construction in the city should be carried out, first and foremost, by Sayan enterprises, which should be provided with work.
Already in October, a 60-apartment house for orphans in the Leningrad microdistrict will be put into operation.
As far as construction is concerned, I would like to add that Sayansk is one of four towns in the Priangarya region that has been included in the program for the construction of economy-class housing.
All the necessary documentation has been prepared.
Construction of 90 block sections will begin in the near future.
In total, we have announced the construction of 10 thousand square meters of housing. There are a lot of people who want to participate in the program.
One of the conditions is that the dwelling should not be more expensive than 30 thousand roubles per square meter, this cost includes turnkey finishing.
If we manage to meet the set volumes, we will continue to participate in the program.
As for investors, we have other interesting projects.
At one time, the Sayan Pig Complex was under construction on the territory, which was sold for nothing in 2004.
We are working with the prosecutor's office to challenge the deal.
Especially as the land under the object is in federal ownership.
Work is underway with Moscow to resolve the issue of transferring 88 hectares to regional ownership, followed by the transfer of land to the municipality.
There is a potential investor ready to invest 1.5 billion roubles in the reconstruction and launch of the project.
With the launch of the pig complex, we will have 900 jobs, which will be a great help for the city.
Is the Institute of Social Partnership Developed in Sayansk?
We have concluded about 140 social and economic partnership agreements.
Many projects have been implemented thanks to the active social position of business representatives.
Significant support is provided by such enterprises as ZAO Vostok-Center, Novo-Ziminskaya CHPP, OOO Sayansky Broiler, OOO PK MDF, and the management of these enterprises responds to all requests.
Just in time for the City Day, LLC "Sayansky Broiler" presented the city with a children's village, and the firm "Vostok-Center" carried out repairs to the equestrian yard, where specialists are engaged in children's and paediatric therapy, at a cost of more than 1 million roubles.
Thanks to sponsorship funds, it was possible to improve the territory of the city registry office.
Sponsors helped celebrate City Day in a colorful way.
As in the good old days, a parade was held with the participation of city collectives and organizations.
A chronicle of the city, a book of Sayan poets, was published.
Pioneers and people who made a serious contribution to the development of Sayansk were awarded jubilee medals.
Philanthropists also participate in the work of the city's charitable foundation.
The first step was to acquire instruments for talented young musicians.
In nine months, more than 800 thousand roubles were allocated to support talented children, to help children in need of expensive treatment, and to support children from low-income families.
How are personnel problems in the social sphere solved in Sayansk?
There is a shortage of doctors and subject teachers in the city.
The provision of housing for specialists is of great importance for the solution of the personnel issue.
Over the past year, we have allocated five apartments for doctors, and four teachers have been provided with service housing.
We have a housing allocation program in place, with the possibility of privatizing it in five years.
There are plans to redesign the building, which will include eight more apartments for teachers.
Teachers and doctors also participate in the Housing for Russian Families program.
In the future, the construction of a house for public sector workers.
The most important thing is that the city has a capable team with which I can solve the most difficult issues.
It is important to draw the right conclusions from all crises, and life will not stop.
The potential of Sayansk and our region is great.
A bill on indexation of social pensions to account for price increases has been submitted to the Duma.
A bill has been introduced in the State Duma providing for the indexation of social pensions annually from February 1, taking into account the rise in prices.
The author of the document - a deputy from Just Russia, Alexander Lomakin-Rumyantsev - also proposes to carry out additional indexation of pensions on April 1, if the rate of growth of the subsistence minimum exceeds the rate of growth of prices for goods and services.
According to current legislation, social pensions are indexed annually from April 1, taking into account the growth rate of the pensioner's subsistence minimum in the Russian Federation over the past year.
A draft law submitted to the lower house provides for the indexation of social pensions according to the rate of increase in consumer prices.
At the same time, the first indexation is postponed to February 1, and the second one is held on April 1.
The head of the OSCE PA told Mogherini about the inadmissibility of imposing sanctions on parliamentarians.
In an official letter to the EU High Representative for Foreign Affairs, Federica Mogherini, the Speaker of the OSCE PA, Ilkka Kanerva, stated the inadmissibility of sanctions against legislators participating in the Assembly's activities.
This was reported by Nikolai Kovalev, a member of the Russian delegation at the autumn session of the OSCE PA in Ulan Bator.
According to TASS, signatures of European parliamentarians, including representatives of Germany, France, Italy, Cyprus, and Greece, were collected in support of Kanerva's position.
"There is already quite a lot of support," Kovalev said.
Earlier, he stated that the head of the OSCE PA spoke with the intention to collect signatures of deputies who pointed out the inadmissibility of imposing sanctions on parliamentarians.
In particular, Kovalev noted, Kanerva promised to raise the issue at the level of the European Union's governing structures and "send the relevant petition."
The NHC says there is a 60 percent chance of a cyclone south of the Cape Verde Islands
A wide front of low pressure about 350 miles (560 kilometers) south of the southern tip of the Cape Verde Islands has a 60 percent chance of becoming a tropical cyclone within the next 48 hours, the U.S. National Hurricane Center said Tuesday.
Another well-defined area of low pressure roughly halfway between the Cape Verde Islands and the Lesser Antilles also has a 60 percent chance of becoming a tropical cyclone in the next two days, Miami-based forecasters said.
Google launches campaign to double donations to raise $11m for refugees
Google Inc (GOOGL.O) has announced a doubling of donations to raise $11 million for humanitarian organizations helping refugees fleeing war-torn and impoverished countries in Europe.
Google took an uncharacteristically personal approach, announcing a fundraising campaign on its blog.
Instead of a statement from one of the executives, Google employee Rita Masood, who fled Kabul with her family when she was seven, described her personal experience.
"We arrived on dubious trains and buses, suffering hunger, thirst, cold and fear," she wrote.
I was lucky.
But, as Europe's refugee and migrant crisis has intensified, many people like my family are in desperate need of help.
Donations will go to four non-profit organizations working to help refugees and migrants: Médecins Sans Frontières, the International Rescue Committee, Save the Children, and the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.
Google has said it will double the first $5.5 million in donations until the amount at google.com / refugee reaches $11 million.
Europe is facing the worst refugee crisis since World War II, triggered largely by Syria's four-year civil war, which has displaced more than 4 million people this year.
Many are also fleeing war-torn Afghanistan, Yemen, Iraq, and Libya.

Slightly obese diabetics may benefit from obesity surgery
The beneficial effects of obesity surgery on slightly obese people with type 2 diabetes can last for at least five years, according to a new study.
However, it is too early to say that slightly obese diabetics live longer after obesity surgery than those who receive non-surgical treatment.
"Mortality statistics don't show up immediately," said Dr. Robin Blackstone, an obesity surgery expert who wrote about the new study in a column for JAMA Surgery.
Obesity surgery, or bariatric surgery, uses a variety of techniques to reduce the size of the stomach.
They reduce hunger and limit organisms "ability to digest food.
Bariatric surgery has been shown to be effective in treating type 2 diabetes for several years, but major studies have been conducted among morbidly obese people with a body mass index (BMI) of 35 or higher.
BMI, a measure of weight relative to height, is considered normal at between 18.5 and 24.9.
A BMI of 25 or above indicates that a person is overweight, and people with a BMI above 30 are considered obese.
You can calculate your BMI here: 1.usa.gov / 1D0ZqDv.
For the new study, researchers from Taiwan's Min-Sheng General Hospital used data collected since 2007 to compare two types of bariatric surgery - gastric bypass and sleeve gastrectomy - with the medical treatment of type 2 diabetes in people with mild obesity.
The average BMI of those who underwent surgery fell from 31 to 24.5 by the end of the fifth year of their study.
Meanwhile, the BMI of those receiving non-surgical treatment for diabetes remains around 29.
Among those who underwent surgery, 36% were completely cured of diabetes, and 28% were partially cured.
In the drug-treated group, by comparison, only 1% were fully cured of diabetes, and only about 2% were partially cured.
In addition, blood pressure, triglycerides, and "bad" LDL cholesterol "were generally better in the surgical group," the authors said.
The researchers also controlled blood haemoglobin A1c levels, which reflect blood sugar levels over time.
Haemoglobin A1c is better kept below 7%, the researchers write.
After surgery, the average hemoglobin A1c decreased from about 9% to about 6%.
In the therapeutic group, however, it remained stable, at around 8%.
But better glycemic control, reflected in good levels of hemoglobin A1c, did not reduce mortality over five years, according to study leader Dr. Chee-Cheng Soo and colleagues.
The research team also compared the average results of the two types of surgical treatment.
By the fifth year, compared to the arm gastrectomy group, the bypass group lost more weight (18.7 kg versus 14.2 kg), achieved greater reductions in BMI (7.4 versus 5.1) and hemoglobin A1c (3.1% versus 2.1%), and was closer to complete diabetes remission (46.9% versus 16.7%).
Although the new study does not show the benefits of surgery in terms of life expectancy after five years, there is evidence from a study of overweight people in Sweden that surgery does increase life expectancy, according to Blackstone of the University of Arizona's College of Medicine in Phoenix.
According to a Swedish study, obese people who chose bariatric surgery were about 29% less likely to die within 15 years than those who used more traditional methods.
Although the new study did not show an increase in life expectancy, Blackstone said it encouraged people with a BMI below 35 interested in the procedure.
"This report is important because it argues that such surgery is safe in a low-BMI group where there is no increased risk of death or kidney disease," she said.
Blackstone added that people and their doctors should start taking weight seriously as soon as a patient's BMI falls between 27 and 30.
"I think we wait too long to get people to take it seriously," she said.
It seems to me that once they accumulate the genetic changes that trigger obesity and diabetes in their bodies, it is very difficult to reverse this.
In Mytischi, robbers took fur coats and 9 million roubles out of the house.
In Mytischi, robbers attacked residents of a house near Moscow and stole 9 million roubles and three women's fur coats from them.
Interfax informs about this with reference to the press service of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Russian Federation.
The incident happened on Tuesday morning.
Two unknown men entered the house located on Gorky Street through an open front door, tied up the 20-year-old son of the owner of the house and, threatening both with a knife, stole 9 million roubles and three fur coats.
According to preliminary data, the amount of damage amounted to 9 million 265 thousand roubles, a criminal case was opened under the article "Robbery."
Fans from Europe are at risk of homelessness.
Only 23 St. Petersburg hotels have the right to accommodate tourists who will come to watch the 2018 FIFA World Cup.
The rest of the hotels are in no hurry to get permission.
According to experts, this is a very worrying sign.
In the run-up to the World Championships, the authorities will urgently have to figure out how to accommodate all the guests of the city.
Interlocutors Rosbalt believe that because of the tournament, the cost of renting apartments will increase by 10-30%, and after the championship, rental housing will have to be overpaid.
The World Cup has forced the authorities to pay attention to the condition of Russian hotels.
According to the law written specifically for superiority, every hotel in St. Petersburg must undergo a classification procedure and prove that it meets the declared number of stars and the level of service.
It is already clear that not everyone will be able to do this: hoteliers are so afraid of inspections that they often do not even send documents to requests from the Federal Antimonopoly Service in St. Petersburg.
According to the head of FAS Vadim Vladimirov, the agency studied 138 hotels and now plans to open 34 cases against hotels, many of which simply did not respond to antitrust authorities.
There are signs that the management of three dozen companies deceived citizens by placing a certain number of stars in advertisements, noted Vladimirov.
The problem is that right now, literally every number is on the table, not one can be lost before 2018.
Officials suspect that during the football championship, fans will occupy all of St. Petersburg's hotels.
Now tourists can count on 30,500 rooms in the city.
According to Smolny, there are 17 five-star hotels in St. Petersburg, 51 four-star hotels, 100 two- and three-star hotels, and 550 one-star hotels.
According to the First Deputy Committee for Tourism Development, Nana Guichiya, only 23 hotels have been classified so far - so many inspections have been carried out by companies accredited in St. Petersburg.
By a remarkable coincidence of circumstances, Smolny does not know whether any hotel has ordered such a procedure from regional enterprises.
That is, there may be more who have been classified, but no one knows about it.
"Over the last six months, hotels have not been very keen to be classified," admitted Ekaterina Shadskaya, Director of the North-West Branch of the Russian Union of Travel Industry.
This is due to the high season, during which hoteliers earn the most money and do not want to do other things.
Another reason is the budgets, which did not include the costs of inspections, and the procedure can cost the hotel, depending on its status, from 30 to 100 thousand roubles or more.
However, recently the managers of hotels have become more active and began to apply for classification, Shadskaya assured.
Hotels must have time before July 1, 2016, otherwise they will not only pay the fine, but also will not have the right to work at the World Cup.
It is already known that, depending on the stars, a fixed fee for a hotel room will be worked out for the duration of the tournament.
The formulas on which the cost will be calculated will be made public next year.
This is to prevent prices from soaring by 200-300%, as happens, for example, during the St. Petersburg Economic Forum.
You have to have a conscience and not allow the increase by two or three times, but the hotels have to be allowed to earn money as well.
"I think that the growth will be up to 50%," explained Gennady Lamshin, President of the Russian Hotel Association.
For his part, Vadim Vladimirov is not sure that price fixing corresponds to an understanding of a market economy.
I do not know whether this fits within the framework of economic theory, but I hope that this measure is justified.
"This is better than a runaway rise in prices," he said.
It is not clear what will happen to popular low-cost hostels.
State Duma deputies have introduced a bill according to which hostels should be banned in residential buildings.
We very much hope that this law will not be adopted or will not apply to St. Petersburg.
"We will defend the view that the hostels should be preserved," says Nana Gvacia.
However, according to her, owners of mini-hotels should be ready to tighten the Housing Code in any case.
If the State Duma does approve the bill, approximately 80% of hostels in St. Petersburg will close, and currently there are 1,500 rooms in them.
According to Leonid Garbar, President of the Federation of restaurateurs and hoteliers in the North-West, there are not enough two- and three-star hotels in St. Petersburg, which are exactly in demand by football fans, but there is a bias towards four- and five-star hotels.
This is analogous to a situation where "75,000 VIPs are sitting in an 80,000-seat stadium."
This can be remedied by mini-hotels.
The expert considers their possible ban "idiotic": "It seems strange to me that some people can live in apartments, but for some reason visitors cannot."
If a hostel is used as a hostel, then I agree that it is wrong.
But if it is a short-term hotel, why not?
Mini-hotels are also at risk of missing the World Cup because of their sloppiness.
As many as hundreds of small hotels simply won't be able to pass the classification, and the hole is being dug for themselves.
By the summer of 2016, all hotels in the city will be ordering the works.
"There are not many companies that can carry out this procedure, so they will refuse less-paid orders from mini-hotels, and will choose the ones that are more expensive," noted Gennady Lamshin, adding that in a number of cities, such as Moscow and Volgograd, the rates of completed inspections are currently significantly higher than those in St. Petersburg.
The reason for the St. Petersburg delay is connected, among other things, with the constant reshuffling of the tourist block of the government, which is not conducive to coordinated work.
According to experts, if St. Petersburg hotels are not enough for everyone, it is likely that we will have to pay attention to regional hotels and vacation homes.
Following the example of the celebration of the 300th anniversary of St. Petersburg, the river fleet can be mobilized to the city, meaning that guests of the tournament will be able to live in cabins.
In addition, many fans will arrive prepared in vans, where they will be able to spend the night.
"The main thing is not to set up so many hotels that later they will be empty," Gennady Lamshin is sure.
Rental accommodation will also be very popular during the football championship.
Most likely, the city will create a reserve of rental apartments.
Rental rates will rise by 10-30%.
"The obvious is that the first to leave will be housing near the stadium," noted Larisa Bragina, a rental specialist at the Real Estate Development and Research Agency.
Moreover, the rental price may not return to the same level after the championship, especially in the sleeping areas.
This will also be facilitated by the construction of new transport interchanges on the outskirts of the city, she stressed.
We should not forget about the human qualities of the citizens.
For example, Leonid Garbar is sure that St. Petersburg has always been a hospitable city, where people not only suggest a way, but can also hold a mini-tour.
There are complications, too.
My father met a family from Murmansk in 1970 - a father, a mother and two children.
They had nowhere to sleep: it was difficult to stay with hotels at the time, and it was hard to sleep at the train station.
"And Dad brought them to our communal apartment to sleep," the interlocutor recalled.
However, he added that now there is no such feature in the residents of the city - calling home is fraught with consequences and scary.
But perhaps in 2018, after the failed decisions of the State Duma, the mistakes of hoteliers and governments, it will be necessary to recall the past?
Zhirinovsky "merged" the Amur region.
Today I watched Zhirinovsky's clown in the State Duma with admiration.
He did such things when our generation was still learning to sell newspapers, and he is still in great shape.
The theme of the speech, it seems, is "LDPR protest against the results of the elections in the Amur region."
The LDPR does not shake the protocols, because there is nothing; it seems that the LDPR has no protocols other than those signed by the election commissions.
Here he raises the runner-up Ivan Abramov and shouts something like: "Here is the winner of the election!"
And then, after a scuffle with the presiding officer, he leads the faction out of the meeting room, shouting literally, "You are all your crooks and thieves at the front."
Naturally, the press focuses not on Abramov, but on the scandal and demarche of the faction as a consequence of this scandal and insult.
In fact, Wolfovich has blended the Amur region with Abramov in a beautiful and elegant way.
For the whole country, this is another Zhirinovsky-style "Scum!" trick, not a protest by a political party against the results of a particular election.
Both the faction and the election, according to the party's website and Ivan Abramov's Facebook account, have not been formally recognized, but the leader is clearly in tears.
Allows the dead on Amur to bury their own dead, and he preaches the gospel against United Russia as a whole and the innocent Rodnina.
A graceful decision not to lose face, and not to go into a real, not ostentatious, scandal.
Another thing is that Abramov himself is now in a strange position.
Apart from screaming from his superiors, he didn't wait for anything, there are no alternative protocols on his hands.
It - not in the focus of public attention, on the one hand, and on the other - for a narrow circle, it became a formal reason for both insulting the esteemed champion, and, even more abruptly, the shambolic attacks on the EP and the ONF.
And here, of course, he needs to think very hard about what to do.
Because from being the main beneficiary of the elections, the number 2 politician of the region and the number 1 candidate for the only regional uninominal constituency, he may turn into a pariah who has successfully used his own party leadership and a super-irritant for the very ONF and the party leadership of someone else.
That is for sure - Zhirinovsky would not have been there, he should have been invented and observed respectfully.
Trump still has a long way to go.
There was news that the LDPR will return to the hall during the next plenary session.
That is, the bath has fallen from nothing at all.
The only thing is that Abramov's subject is buried beneath it.
Beautiful indeed.
"It's impossible for everyone to come to Europe" - Dalai Lama - RT News
Europe cannot accept all refugees, the Dalai Lama said, adding that the real solution to the current refugee crisis lies in the Middle East.
A Tibetan Buddhist leader has called for an end to violence in countries home to refugees.
The Dalai Lama addressed the ongoing refugee crisis in a speech at the opening of the Dalai Lama's Centre for Compassion in Oxford, devoted to ethics research, at the start of his 10-day visit to the UK.
In the circumstances, he said, the interests of humanity should take precedence over those of individual countries or even continents.
He also stressed that, while admirable, the response of Western European countries to the refugee crisis was inadequate.
"It is inconceivable that everyone would come to Europe," he said in a speech.
While the Dalai Lama praised the German and Austrian responses to the crisis, he stressed that this was only a temporary solution.
"Taking care of thousands of refugees is great, but at the same time you have to think about long-term solutions, how to bring real peace and real development, mainly through education, to these Muslim countries," he said.
After all, we must think about how to reduce the murder rate in their countries.
We must weaken the use of force.
The use of force has never solved these problems, "he added.
Speaking of violence, the Dalai Lama also commented on George W. Bush's handling of the 9 / 11 terrorist attacks, saying that the tough US response set in motion a chain of uncontrollable events.
After 9 / 11, I expressed my condolences in a letter to President Bush and told him that the solution was non-violence.
I know his intentions were good, but he used force and it had unexpected consequences, "the Dalai Lama said.
Four-fold increase in the number of children swallowing hand sanitizer in the last 4 years
Toxicology centers in the United States have reported a nearly 400 percent increase since 2010 in the number of children under 12 who swallowed a hand sanitizer with a high alcohol content, according to the Georgia Poison Control Center.
Cases of children under 12 ingesting hand sanitizers reported to poison centers rose from 3,266 in 2010 to 16,117 in 2014, according to Dr. Gaylord Lopez, director of the Georgia Poison Center.
"Children come into contact with these substances more often, and unfortunately some percent of them are sent to the emergency room," Lopez told CNN.
He said some children drink the disinfectant on purpose, and some do so to impress their friends, or in an argument for social media.
Youtube videos show teenagers drinking disinfectant liquid as cheap booze.
The teenagers reportedly mixed disinfectant with an alcohol-containing mouthwash to get a stronger drink.
Younger children may be attracted to the pleasant odors of disinfectant.
"The child doesn't think it's going to hurt him," Lopez said.
Many of the most attractive (hand sanitizers) are those that are flavored.
There are hand sanitizers with the scent of strawberries, grapes, and oranges, which are very attractive to children.
Hand sanitizer contains anywhere from 45 to 95 per cent alcohol.
In young children in particular, just a few sprays can cause alcohol poisoning.
"It's high-concentration alcohol," Dr. Stephen Thornton, chief medical officer of the toxicology center at the University of Kansas Hospital, told Fox 4 in Kansas City.
You wouldn't just leave a glass of whiskey like that, but people keep these hand sanitizers in sight, and if the kids get there, it's a quick way to consume a lot of alcohol.
Naija Russell, a six-year-old girl who recently ingested about four strawberry-flavored hand sanitizers at school, was taken to the emergency room for treatment.
She had a blood alcohol level of 179, twice the legal limit for an adult, according to Dr. Chris Ritchie, an emergency physician who treated her at Gwinnett Medical Center near Atlanta.
Naija was confused and unable to walk when she was taken to the emergency room.
Doctors monitored her through the night at a separate children's clinic to avoid any signs of brain injury as alcohol caused the girl to fall and hit her head, Ritchie said.
"It was very scary," Ortoria Scott, Naiji's mother, told CNN.
It could well have been fatal for my child.
Lopez recommended that parents and teachers use non-alcoholic substances or disinfectant wipes, in addition to removing hand sanitizers from children's reach.
In addition to alcohol poisoning, some disinfectants have been linked to deaths.
In 2013, two Ontario women died after swallowing a disinfectant containing a toxic undeclared ingredient.
Health officials suspect the product contained methanol, a lethal agent, rather than ethanol, which was listed as an active substance.
In January, three fourth-graders in upstate New York conspired to poison their "nasty" teacher by "distributing antibacterial agents in the classroom," according to a police report.
The teacher is allergic to hand sanitizers and has banned them from her classroom.
Police believe the failed plan was "empty talk" and are addressing discipline issues with the school district.
As the oldest children's library in Barnaul, it became a family club.
On the back of a bench at the entrance to the local children's library named after N.K. Krupskaya, a cast-iron owl is sad.
Toddlers who come to collect books try to feed her sweets.
He has been visiting the library for several generations now, for 95 years.
The very first readers in the 1920s organized loud readings here, staged plays based on Mayakovsky's poems, conducted literary quizzes and corresponded with Lenin's wife.
The correspondence lasted four years, and, as the Young Stalinist newspaper wrote in 1939, "the friendship between Nadezhda Konstantinovna Krupskaya and friends of the Barnaul Children's Library" grew stronger by the day.
Nadezhda Konstantinovna even once sent her children's photo to distant Barnaul friends.
And when Barnaul's people asked whether Nadezhda Konstantinovna objected to the library being named after her, she wrote that she did not, did not object.
Letters have long been dusted off in the museum, and the grandchildren and great-grandchildren of the first readers have had to explain whose austere profile graces the bas-relief on the library building.
During the perestroika years, various people often called and resented: why wasn't the children's library renamed?
Let there be a library named after some good children's writer, without political coloring!
The library staff sat down, thought about it, and decided to leave it as it was.
"Krupskaya" is perhaps the most famous and beloved library in Barnaul, as "Leninka" in Moscow.
There is a yellow brick walkway on the floor in the library lobby.
"The Wizard of the Emerald City" is a favorite theme of artist Oli Moskovka.
Previously, Olga was a manager in a law firm, came to work at eight, left at five, and from all other managers differed only by her love of drawing.
And then I found an ad on the Internet: "You need an illustrator for a book."
The book was written by a little American girl, and it was called "My Cancer Mommy" - "My mum has cancer."
Olga was making illustrations, and she thought that life could end at any moment, and there would be no miracles in it if you didn't create them yourself.
Now she works in a library, illustrates children's books by writers around the world, and composes fairy tales herself.
Traditionally, it is believed that children lose interest in books, that they increasingly live in some virtual space...
But some children come to us reading, and their parents understand the importance of reading, "Tatiana Kushvid, Director of the Library, tells Russian Planet.
In recent years, we have even had a moment of confidence that the children's library is needed and will live - the children are coming here!
I think the interest in reading is returning.
In the lobby of the library there is a large stained glass window with an updated photo exhibition.
Once a quarter, new photos are posted of readers who go to the library as a family: mom, dad, and children.
The library rejoices that dads are increasingly coming with their children.
If a child has read all of Chukovsky at the age of two, he needs more complicated books at an older age.
But now there is a law according to which an eight-year-old wunderkind is prohibited from issuing books from category 12 +.
To receive such a book, a child must bring his or her parents with him or her - they come and then return again, and gradually Krupskaya becomes something like a family club for them.
There are treasures in the library - a pre-revolutionary collection of yats and fir trees, Korolenko's short story in the supplement to the magazine Niva, and a copy of "Murzilki" from 1936.
After all, we are now not only the conceptual space of the "temple of books," we are now open to movement, we are trying to become a special place: not a home, not a job, not a school, "explains Tatiana Kushvid.
You can come to us to read, play, paint together.
We have made a play area for the kids - the child comes just to play and the hand still reaches for the book!
Some of our readers are being carried away by their parents, but they are leaning on their feet and do not want to leave.
Mothers often come with strollers - and we are pleased that they put the library first among all other places to come with their babies.
Tatiana Kushvid says: Today's children love classic children's literature as much as we once did:
"Publishing is now evolving, and much attention is being paid to authors who are a bridge between generations."
As for young children, it is important for them to have some kind of hero who travels from one book to another.
Children do not like to part with their heroes.
The library regularly publishes booklets for parents, explaining what is happening in contemporary children's literature, which books are worth paying attention to, and why.
The booklets are so fascinating and intriguing that adults are also interested, but this library is not for them.
It is forbidden for adults to carry books outside the reading room.
Only children have this magical privilege.
... In the farthest room of the library there is a square hatch with an ancient wooden staircase to the basement, in the library.
Steps will creak under your feet - it's a very old time machine.
You meet your childhood book like an old friend: hi, it's good that we're not changing.
Ellie still walks merrily along the yellow brick-paved road, the lazy Tolya Ryzhikov steals magic matches, and Boy Kibalchish never told the cursed bourgeois the Military Mystery - he has such a firm word.
These books are like passwords, and you can find out who they are by using them anywhere.
There are also real book rarities in the repository - for example, a pre-revolutionary collection of yats and fir trees.
Or Korolenko's story in the famous supplement to the magazine "Niva."
Or a copy of "Murzilka" from 1936.
Time has aged the pages, coloring them in tea color.
These publications are no longer given to readers.
These are fragments of our future collection, I dream of retiring and doing rare children's books.
But children won't be drawn to it any more, so to speak: the colours in the old books are not very bright, and the topics... you open the first page, and there you have Lenin, the Party, the Young Communist League.
Now it seems: why did we all write this Pioneer Truth?
But it was still interesting, "Galina Ilyasova, Head of the Book Depository, tells Russian Planet.
The pages of "Murzilka" have darkened with time.
Galina Vasilyevna has been in charge of the book store all her life.
She knows the colour of Buratino's cap, the school year in which Harry Potter became captain of Gryffindor's team at the Quidditch Championships, the situations in which Carlson uses a silencer for a motor, and the work of Alice Selezneva's father.
The work of a librarian is poorly paid, and anyone who can live without these books quickly finds another profession.
Only the most convinced remain: educators, pedagogues, and ministers of the cult of the book.
They can also be recognized by a smile - it is believed that this is a professional trait of a children's librarian.
If he smiles at you in the first minute of a conversation, he is a professional.
In general, I love children's books: as a librarian, I like to have them, so that they stand straight and beautifully on the shelves, and I also love reading them, "says Galina Vasilyevna.
I read everything: military, historical stories, fairy tales, fiction.
I read contemporary Russian authors, fresh translations...
Of course, I think my childhood was different.
The books were the most interesting and exciting thing that ever happened to me.
And because I loved them madly, it seemed to me that the library was a magical place.
And I wanted to work where everyone sat and read.
I hope there will always be books, despite the readers.
And I rejoice when our former readers bring their children, or even grandchildren...
Rumour Mill: No disagreements at Celtic
Griffiths dismissed talk of a rift at Celtic following Deila's admission that the Hoops are in a bad position, but he will fix it.
Hearts will protest the Scottish Football Association's claim against Neilson, while Warburton fears January signing could break the team's unity
The Dons have increased their lead over Celtic to five points
Adam Rooney's penalty in the first half gave Aberdeen a narrow lead over Hamilton at Pittodrie, allowing the Dons to move five points clear of Celtic.
Griffiths has denied talk of a rift
That sparked speculation of a rift at Celtic, which was quashed by Griffiths, who said he and his team-mates were not suffering any increased criticism as they prepared to face the Dutch League leaders.
I don't think we're feeling the pressure, I think the players are looking for it.
The Dutch are bored because the Scots are not in contention for the title - De Boer
Former Rangers midfielder and former member of the Dutch national team Ronald de Boer has claimed that Dutch football fans have lost interest in Celtic because he is not competing for the title with Rangers.
De Boer, now of Ajax, said: "In Holland, the highlights of Celtic's games are no longer shown, so why not?"
That's because there's no Rangers.
People here are not just talking about the return of Rangers.
They talk about the Old Firm.
They talk about both teams together and that's what they're interested in.
There is a lot of tension in the Old Firm games and it is not just people in Scotland who want to see these games.
"I will change everything," Deila said
Ronny Deila has admitted Celtic are in trouble but the Norwegian coach has vowed to change everything.
The defeat by Malmö and, as a result, their exit from the Champions League was soon followed by the loss of 10 players to Aberdeen, who are now five points clear at the top of the table.
But Deila said: "Celtic have had bad periods before and we will come out again."
We now want to get out of this as quickly as possible.
I understand that it is very frustrating and a lot of people are very, very angry or upset about what is going on.
We are, too, but we must continue.
And we really, really need Celtic's support because that makes the players a lot better.
Staying together now is so important.
Warburton looks forward to January transfer window with incredulity
Despite opinions emerging just a couple of weeks ago suggesting he had identified some of the January transfer targets, Rangers boss Mark Warburton is incredulous about the January campaign, claiming he does not want to disrupt the team's unity.
The former Brentford striker said: "The January transfer window is very different from the summer window."
As for the players who come in the summer, you have a period before the start of the season to adapt them, which you have seen in our own group this season.
The team is doing really well.
Sometimes more damage is done by adding unnecessary players to the ones you really need.
Michu, who is wanted by Celtic, has hinted at the end of his career
Swansea striker Michu, linked with Celtic during the transfer window, has hinted that he may quit football after his contract with the Swans expires.
The 29-year-old has been plagued by ankle problems for two years and was unable to leave Wales this summer.
Hearts set to fight SFA over Neilson claims
Hearts were leading 2-1 when Paterson was sent off and went on to lose 3-2, but the defender's red card was later overturned - Collum's third red card in eight months.
Neilson does not back down, saying: "I didn't question the ethics, I didn't comment on the game."
Griffiths vows to avoid Tynecastle
A stubborn Hibernian player has been reprimanded after admitting he sang a song with offensive words about former Hearts player Rudi Skacel.
The incident happened at a pub in the Roseburn area of Edinburgh ahead of the Edinburgh derby at Tynecastle in March 2014.
"It was a derby and it was heated," said the striker, adding: "I can safely say I wasn't going to go back to Tynecastle if he didn't play for Celtic.
Donnelly: Tannadice board confident in Dundee United management
Simon Donnelly says the Dundee United board remains confident that the management team will make a difference, but agrees that the deterioration on the pitch must end.
I think Stephen Thompson believes in us.
We'll prepare the guys to come out again, "Donnelly said.
McInnes glad he won 'ugly' against Hamilton
Derek McInnes admitted his Aberdeen team had to battle desperately against Hamilton Assis to secure a seventh successive league victory, putting them five points above Celtic at the top of the table thanks to Adam Rooney's penalty in the first half.
McInnes said: "There is no team here that has won anything - the cup or the league championship - that hasn't won a match like that."
Unemployment rate for Scots stagnates, while it is rising in the UK as a whole
UNEMPLOYMENT in Scotland remained at 164,000 between May and July, while the number of people out of work in the UK as a whole increased by 10,000 to 1.82 million over the same period.
Scotland's unemployment rate of 5.9% was higher than the UK rate of 5.5%, figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) showed.
Meanwhile, employment in Scotland fell by 12,000 in three months, with the number of people in work now standing at 2,612,000.
Scotland's employment rate fell to 74.0% in the quarter - above the UK average of 73.5%.
Scottish Secretary David Mundell, commenting on the latest figures, said: "The government's long-term plan has laid the foundations for a stronger economy."
It is almost exactly a year since Scotland made the historic decision to remain part of the United Kingdom.
Over the past 12 months, we have seen further improvement in Scotland's labour market, with employment rising and unemployment falling.
Why I Witnessed Oklahoma's Execution
Today, avoiding legal intervention at a late stage, I will watch as a person is executed.
If that happens, and I hope it doesn't, I will sit in the viewing gallery of Oklahoma's death row when Richard Glossip is executed by lethal injection.
He asked me to be one of four official witnesses to his death.
The request was first made back in January, through a close friend, and although I was shocked, I agreed.
As that day approached, I began to fear.
So why do it?
I agreed because I thought it was a good way to tell a detailed story of the death penalty.
This would offer a unique perspective.
Yes, journalists are allowed to attend executions in America, and, because there are often more people willing than seats, the results of the grim lottery decide who is chosen.
In Oklahoma, the number of press seats was reduced from 12 to five.
Whoever is chosen will look at it with no emotion.
I can't do that.
I will be sitting with Richard Glossip's closest friends and we have a relationship of our own after months of phone calls and one visit lasting two and a half hours.
I like this guy.
We often laugh when we talk to him.
The prison authorities claim that I cannot be both a witness and a journalist, so I will not be allowed to take a notepad and pen to record what I see.
I will have to try to remember all the details.
One journalist from Oklahoma accused me on Twitter of compromising my impartiality.
That is a lesson.
Tell the prisoner's story as he likes, get access.
I complained to her.
She admitted that she "could have worded it better myself," but still believes that I am wrong about what I am doing.
Richard Glossip disagreed with some of what I said and wrote.
He didn't tell me what to write, and I wouldn't, even if he did.
I told him that he could strike me off his witness list at any time.
But he wants a journalist from an international publication to be there to write about it.
If he died, he believed that publicity would help the abolitionist movement.
Kim Bellver, a Huffington Post reporter, will be with me.
If you want to learn more about the case, listen to the podcasts I have recorded.
I will not go into the details here again.
I cannot say with certainty that Richard Glossip is not guilty.
His actions after the murder of Barry van Treese make him guilty of aiding and abetting the crime.
But I believe there is a strong possibility that he is not guilty of murder.
I firmly believe that the evidence for the death penalty was insufficient.
I believe his execution is wrong.
From this perspective, I will watch him die.
I cannot claim to be completely objective.
There will be other reporters to turn to.
You will learn from me what it is like to watch someone I love die needlessly.
Man pursued by police persuaded to climb out of Canning River
The constable from Canning Vale managed to persuade the man to climb out of the Canning River and stay dry himself.
The Perth resident intended to evade police but failed after getting stuck in the muddy water in the shallows a few metres away from a police officer trying to "gently coax him ashore."
Canning Vale Police were called on Tuesday to reports of trespassing in Buckingham.
When police spotted the suspect, he tried to get away from them by rushing to Canning.
But he didn't go far.
"He was standing in the water and saying 'I'm not going to get out, come on, grab me'," Senior Sergeant Shandell Castledine said.
Constable Lachlan Perhavec was not keen on urinating on his uniform, so he used the safer technique of "talking to a good cop."
"Sometimes people do weird things to try to escape," said Senior Sergeant Castledine.
Champion footballer Ben Cousins is remembered for that.
In 2006, Cousins drove into a ditch to avoid meeting a police patrol for an alcohol test and tried to swim across Swan.
His efforts were in vain, but spurred the locals to invent Ben Cousins's comic "biathlon."
Peter Moody accuses stewards of attempted espionage and threatens to quit equestrian sport
Peter Moody accused Racing Victoria stewards of trying to introduce a spy to his stable last year and threatened to quit equestrian racing immediately.
His target was stewards and Racing Victoria ethics officers, whom he accused of running a personal campaign against him, and the suspension of Lady Tatai for a drugs violation on the day of the start, on Wednesday, was the final straw.
Moody told Fairfax Media he always tried his best in racing and found himself in a difficult position when it came to the positive result of Lidari's test for cobalt, which he could not explain.
He stuck his tongue out on suspected espionage for a year and a half and did not want it to "look like green grapes."
"I wasn't going to say anything about it and I've been patient for a long time, but sometimes it gets you so out of your rut that you can't hold back," Moody said.
They know it went on.
Sometimes you react and then you have to live with the consequences and I have to live with what I said.
Today I will go home and sleep well.
I want to walk with my head held high and I want my owners to know I'm doing my best for them.
When they start to think that's not the case, then I need to stop being a coach.
Then I will have to think about what to do with my license.
Earlier, Moody sensationally claimed during an interview on racing.com that the ethics office had tried to spy on his stable.
"A year and a half ago, Terry Bailey, Dale Browne and Dr Brian Stewart sat in a room with someone I would name if asked and offered him a job at my stable to report on what I was doing at my stable," Moody said on Racing.com.
They obviously think I'm a fraud.
If that is the case, surely they should all apply, as they have failed in their attempt to catch me.
Robert Ralston, the former chairman of the RVL, David Moody, the current chairman of the RVL, and Bernard Sondry, the current chief executive of the RVL, have known this all along and know it now.
Shouldn't that make me think it's becoming personal?
Shouldn't the RVL have the courage to hold people other than coaches accountable for what is going on in the business?
Am I bad for the profession?
Am I so bad for the profession?
Maybe people out there think that's the case.
Maybe they should take away my license and push me away, and I have no doubt that what I say now might make them think about it.
But I have now reached a point where I don't care, and that makes me sad.
I'm really sad about it.
I will put pressure on them to make a decision.
I have the support of my family and I can leave.
The trainer's frustration grew during the long investigation into cobalt and Lidari, and the horse's recent withdrawal from the race led him to declare that he could "throw his license on the table."
Moody, best known for training unbeaten champion Black Caviar, called the drug requirements on race day "ridiculous" after the horse's feet were sprayed with a clay compress, which is a violation of the rules.
It's a breach of the rules at horse racing.
"I have to take full responsibility for this," he said.
One of my employees mistakenly put a compress on her leg.
She could have got a compress last night.
She could have got it yesterday, as she did.
She was with him on race day.
Moody could be disqualified for three months under competition day drug rules for using a compress, which stewards have opened an investigation into.
It's a joke.
The people who make these rules know nothing about horses.
"We all know we need rules, but it's gone too far," Moody said.
The driver who ran over and fled the scene in Kobram has been arrested
Police have arrested a man who knocked down a motorcyclist in Kobram over the weekend and fled the scene.
A motorcyclist has been airlifted to Royal Melbourne Hospital with serious injuries after being hit by a car on Murray Valley Highway on Saturday morning.
Police said the driver left without stopping to help the injured motorcyclist.
The 50-year-old from Natalia turned himself in to police in Shepparton on Monday.
He is expected to be charged with leaving the scene, failing to assist and other traffic violations.
The motorcyclist, a 40-year-old from Kobram, remains in hospital in a stable condition.
Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy refutes rival allegations of violent tactics
Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy has described his team's criticism of his interception of the ball as "agenda-setting" by the two favourites for the NRL championship.
Sydney Roosters coach Trent Robinson has claimed referees allowed the Storm to "struggle" with his team during the Storm's surprise win in the final qualifying game in Sydney on Friday night.
Brisbane Broncos coach Wayne Bennett made a clear reference to the Storm after his team won the qualifying final against the Northern Queensland Cowboys on Saturday night, when he described the game as "typical" of rugby league and said two of the Queensland team were not "too successful" in a hand-to-hand battle.
Bellamy defended his team's interception of the ball and said they were simply focused on "contact," intercepting the ball.
Bellamy added he had been reassured by criticism of his team from two leading coaches, as it meant they were worried about a possible defeat by the Storm.
"It keeps coming up - I didn't hear Trent Robinson talking about tough tackles when they beat us 24-2," Bellamy said on Wednesday.
I can guarantee we haven't changed anything in our systems or defensive techniques all year, just in the last six weeks we've put a lot of emphasis on contact when intercepting the ball and it's been a turning point for us.
Trent's been there for three years and he's obviously coaching a great team, so he's probably not used to losing and it's been a bit of a shock for him.
It's funny, as it always is at this time of year.
Bellamy took issue with Bennett's idea of "spectacular football," reminding his teacher that Bennett's St George Illawarra Dragons won the championship in 2010 by showing "boring" football.
Wayne talks about exciting football.
He decided to compare his game on Saturday night with ours on Friday night and see how impressive their game was, "Bellamy said.
I remember in 2010 St George's had a lot of criticism, calling them a boring team, and Wayne said he didn't care.
But now he has a team that can show what he considers impressive football, especially their young midfielders with their speed.
It's the football you want to play when you have players like that.
He made that remark in 2010 and now he wants everyone to play his style of football - not every team has two midfielders like Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt to play that way.
It gives me more confidence because they say these things because they are a bit worried about playing with us.
Six weeks ago they probably didn't think about us when they got to the big games.
Bellamy also noted that the Storm-Roosters game was a higher-scoring contest than the Broncos-Cowboys game.
The Broncos game was probably good, I haven't seen it yet, but what was the score? 16-12?
It was 20-18 in our game, there were two more tries - and what, that's impressive football?
Or consider the interruptions and failures impressive?
For me, it's routine.
If they mention us, it means that at some stage we can meet them there.
The Storm have a weekend off this weekend as they win the right to host either the North Queensland Cowboys or the Cronulla Sharks next Saturday night in a preliminary final at AAMI Park Stadium, with tickets going on sale next Tuesday morning.
Serb accused of drug possession released on $200,000 bail
A man facing life in prison for trying to steal 40kg of cocaine smuggled into Queensland has been released on $200,000 bail.
Marko Maksimovich, 29, is one of five people arrested last month after federal police found 100 kilograms of drugs on the Solay yacht, which was travelling from South America through Vanuatu and docked in Coomera in August.
Throughout the morning, Maksimovich and his accomplices were seen at the jetty, and he later met them at Coomera Roadhouse, where police found 40 kilograms of the drug in a Toyota Echo car.
Although Maksimovich faces a life sentence for attempting to appropriate enough drugs for sale, Maksimovich's lawyer argues that there is no evidence that he tried to get the entire shipment, and that the man may have been in the cafe without intent.
Supreme Court Justice Peter Flanagan questioned whether Maksimovich should have been released on bail.
The latter has ties to Serbia.
He travels frequently to Serbia, "he said in court on Wednesday.
During the criminal proceedings, he lied to the police about his whereabouts.
Maksimovich's mother and stepfather were asked to post a joint bond of $200,000 for his release.
"It is clear from the testimony of both men that the amount of $200,000 bail is too much of a financial burden for them," Judge Flanagan said.
But this measure alone is not enough to ensure that it does not disappear, the judge added.
Maksimovic was granted bail on the condition that he surrender both his Australian and Serbian passports, report to police daily and observe a curfew from 6 p.m. to 6 a.m.
Fotis Katsikaris: "I am proud of the Greek national team, which fought until the last seconds."
Head coach of the Greek national team Fotis Katsikaris paid tribute to his team after the match of the quarter-finals of Eurobasketball 2015 with Spain (71: 73).
According to him, individual mistakes decided the fate of the game.
It was a big game, "AFP quoted Katsikaris as saying.
We prepared for a great game by the Spaniards.
We tried to work on defense, but mistakes in defense determined the fate of the meeting.
It's sad, but I'm proud of my guys.
They fought until the last second.
Joel Freeland: "At CSKA I will be given the role of Kaun."
CSKA rookie Joel Freeland has said he does not believe in the curse of the army.
The Briton also expressed confidence that his new club will be able to reverse the negative trend and finally win the Euroleague next season.
I spoke to coach Dimitris Itudis several times this summer and, of course, after I joined the team, "R-Sport" quotes Freeland as saying. "In fact, I will be entrusted with the functions of Sacha Kaun, who has left the team, both in defense and in attack from the three-second zone, and I think I will be able to cope with it.
Yes, it will take me a while to adjust to being a center, but I played more forward in the NBA.
Now I will have to stand up to the big central rivals more, but I have done it before, so I think I will do it now.
The Army last won the Euroleague in 2008.
Since then, they have reached the Final Four six times, but each time they have failed to show their best basketball.
There is a perception that someone has smoothed the team out.
That's the whole game, you can't win forever.
Of course it is difficult, I understand all the frustration of the club and its fans.
But we have a great team now and if we show the best we can, we have a good chance to win the Europa League, I really think so.
I always wanted to win this title, Muscovites have already won the tournament, and I think this year will be CSKA's year.
As for the eye, I am not superstitious and do not believe in any curses.
I believe in hard work and determination, if you combine these two things, anything is possible.
I don't have any specific rituals before the games, I just listen to music and try to relax as much as possible.
Luis Enrique: "For me, the match against Roma will be special."
Barcelona head coach Luis Enrique has made no secret of the fact that he returned to Rome for the first round match of the Champions League group stage against Roma with special feelings.
According to the mentor, the face-to-face duel between his current and former team will become far from ordinary for him.
Recall that Luis Enrique coached "wolves" in the 2011 / 12 season, but failed to prove himself at his best in the Italian capital.
I returned to Rome after a few years of experience, "Luis Enrique was quoted as saying by UEFA's official website.
I have exceptionally fond memories of Rome.
It's going to be a special game for me, but it's not that important.
The main thing is to start in the Champions League with a win.
The August meeting at the Joan Gamper Cup will not affect the actions of the teams in the upcoming match.
I expect Roma to play the game they showed in Serie A against Juventus.
They are a strong team who know how to press and know what to do with the ball.
Vadim Skripchenko: Krasnodar has different variants of attacking actions. "
Acting head coach of "Ural" Vadim Skripchenko in the run-up to the 9th round of the Premier League match with "Krasnodar" noted the variety of attacking schemes of the rival team.
According to the coach, the "bulls" have at their disposal several models of play in attack.
The fight will take place on September 21 and will begin at 16: 30 Moscow time.
How we will play against Krasnodar remains to be seen, "the official Ural website quotes Skripchenko as saying.
We have a whole week of preparation ahead of us.
This team has different attacking options, carries out its attacks in a variety of ways, at the same time we are not a slow team, so I think it will be a very interesting game.
In the run-up to this game, given that Krasnodar is hosting a Europa League match against Borussia Dortmund, we will try to prepare very well to win.
Roger Cañas: "At home, Astana can take points away from anyone."
Astana midfielder Roger Cañas expressed confidence in improving the quality of his team's play in the future after the first-round match of the Champions League group tournament against Benfica (0-2).
According to Khavbek, on their field, Astana residents are capable of taking points from any rival.
Despite the fact that the match turned out to be difficult for us, I can say that we played well, - the official UEFA website quotes Cañas as as saying. - We lacked a little courage in attack.
Benfica are better, but in the home game I think we can expect to take points away from them.
This is real.
But first you have to think about Galatasaray and then Atlético.
In home matches, we can take points from anyone.
Rafael Benítez: "I will say it again and again: Cristiano Ronaldo is the best in the world."
Head coach of Real Madrid Rafael Benítez expressed satisfaction with the big victory in the first round match of the Champions League group tournament against Shakhtar (4-0).
The specialist paid tribute to forward Cristiano Ronaldo, who became the author of three goals.
The match was difficult because Shakhtar know how to control the ball, - the official UEFA website quotes Benítez as saying.
The opponent didn't have many moments, but their counter-attacks are always dangerous.
I will not say that "Real" played perfectly, but we had plenty of scoring opportunities.
I'm pleased we didn't miss the ball and scored four.
Cristiano Ronaldo has confirmed his level.
He's the best player in the world, I'll repeat that as many times as I can.
Jordi Alba: "Cristiano Ronaldo cannot be compared to Messi."
Barcelona defender Jordi Alba believes no-one can match his club-mate Lionel Messi.
According to the Spaniard, Real Madrid forward Cristiano Ronaldo also cannot do it.
Messi is five goals ahead of the rest, "Le Figaro quoted Alba as saying." No one can do what Leo is capable of doing.
Even Cristiano Ronaldo.
Everything changes with Leo on the pitch, I can't compare him to anyone.
Daniele De Rossi: "Barcelona" has not only a unique style, but also bright personalities.
Roma midfielder Daniele De Rossi on the eve of the Champions League group stage match against Barcelona noted the importance of compactness and safety in a game against such a strong opponent.
The meeting will take place tomorrow, starting at 21: 45 Moscow time.
Recall, SE will carry out its text broadcast.
"Barcelona" is a special rival, a good team with great players, - quotes the official UEFA website De Rossi.
It is difficult to play with blue-pomegranate, because they have not only a unique style, but also bright personalities.
To keep them, we will have to plow through the match and hedge each other.
Messi is almost always successful when he gets on the ball, so we need to stay compact and organised.
Yezhov hopes to be included in SKA's starting line-up for the match against Slovakia.
SKA goalkeeper Ilya Ezhov stressed that he hopes to be included in the starting line-up for the next KHL championship match.
Yezhov came on the ice in place of Mikko Koskinen in the 23rd minute with the score 0-3 and repelled all shots on his own goal, the fourth goal SKA missed after replacing the goalie with the sixth field player.
The team will play its next away match against Slovan.
I hope that I will be in the starting line-up for the next match, "R-Sport quotes Yezhov as saying.
I am not an expert on goalkeepers, I am a goalkeeper myself, we do not show replays of missed goals, so it is difficult to track.
Dynamo played well, everyone has bad matches.
The team lost anyway.
I'd rather have missed more, but the team won.
Shafarzhova was admitted to hospital with a viral infection.
Lucy Shafarjova has been hospitalised with a bacterial infection, AFP reports.
At the moment, the Czech tennis player is in a clinic in Brno.
It is not yet known when the 2015 Roland Garros finalist will be reinstated.
Recall also that on Monday, Shafarzhova rose to one place in the WTA rankings and is now the fifth racket in the world.
Stephen Hogg used girl's phone to force paedophiles to send pictures
A paedophile used an 11-year-old girl's phone to solicit images of child abuse.
Stephen Hogg picked up the girl's phone while she was asleep and registered with an online messaging service, where he received a series of lewd images of children sent to him by another user.
The girl woke up to find her phone missing and found it in the hand of a sleeping Hogg.
She checked it out and found the shocking photos, then immediately drew her mother's attention.
Police arrived and saw five images, after which they searched computers found at the address and found "relevant" queries in a search engine using words to detect obscene images of children.
Hogg then told police he did so because it would "attract paedophiles" and then he would "pretend to be a policeman to scare them."
Commissioned bailiff Eilidh Robertson told Dundee Sheriff Court: "He said it was an addiction, he was addicted to scaring people.
He admitted making queries on the computer but said it was because he wanted to pretend to be a police officer to frighten paedophiles.
He was questioned about a conversation he had with an unknown person who had sent him the images and about the fact that he had asked for more photos.
He said he did it to entice them.
He said he had problems with his head when he was drinking and said he wanted to see images of rape and murder.
Ms Robertson added: 'When the girl found the pictures on her phone she called her mother, she was shaking and crying.
She saw the lewd images on her phone and a confrontation was then held with the accused.
The girl was interviewed and reported that the accused used a computer and Playstation to talk to girls who looked much younger than him.
Hogg, 23, of Ward Road, Dundee, pleaded guilty to charges of making indecent photographs of children on June 14 last year, breaching bail conditions on January 25 this year and failing to appear in court for a hearing on March 24 this year.
The defendant's lawyer, Gregor Sim, has asked that Hogg not be listed as a sex offender because it can be shown that there was no "significant sexual element" to the crime.
Sheriff Alistair Carmichael deferred sentence until October, pending reports from social services.
Hogg was released on bail in the case, but was remanded in custody pending hearings in other pending cases.
He was listed as a sex offender before he was sentenced.
Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe reads the wrong speech in parliament
Mr Mugabe, Africa's oldest statesman, fell down the stairs leading from the podium earlier this year.
He was not injured, but a video of the fall scene instantly went viral on social media.
The opening of parliament was also marred by claims by parliamentary opponents that they had received anonymous threats warning them against booing Mugabe during the address.
A month ago, they booed the president during his address to the nation in parliament, a speech Mugabe repeated on Tuesday.
Movement for Democratic Change MP Innocent Gonese said seven opposition politicians had received text messages on their mobile phones warning them not to interrupt Mugabe's speech.
"The message came from a number that is not displayed, but it is entitled" Death, "" he told reporters after Mugabe's speech ended.
Noted members of Parliament were warned that immunity ended in the Houses of Parliament, and as soon as they left, parliamentary immunity did not apply.
The MP said the party, led by Morgan Tsvangirai, was "concerned" about threats to its politicians.
Hewlett-Packard to cut up to 30,000 jobs
Hewlett-Packard expects to cut between 25,000 and 30,000 jobs as part of its restructuring and cost-cutting program in the service sector.
In the same year, Hewlett-Packard will split into two listed companies, separating the computer and printer industries from the faster-growing hardware and service sectors.
Payments resulting from the projected job cuts will amount to about $2.7 billion starting in the fourth quarter, Hewlett-Packard said in a statement.
"This restructuring will provide a more competitive, sustainable cost structure for the new Hewlett Packard Enterprise," said Meg Whitman, Chairman and CEO of Hewlett Packard, who will lead the organization after the split.
"Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and more focused than Hewlett-Packard currently, and its portfolio of business lines will be broader and deeper, helping the company transition to a new business style," Whitman said.
As a separate company, we are in a better position than ever to respond to the growing demands of our customers around the world.
Hewlett Packard Enterprise will have annual revenues of more than $50 billion and "will focus on providing previously unattainable integrated technology solutions" to companies, the company said in a statement.
This is the division of a company founded in the 1930s by Stanford alumni Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard to produce electrical equipment; their Palo Alto garage has been dubbed the "birthplace of Silicon Valley."
Hewlett Packard is in the midst of a major reorganization to shift from traditional personal computers to mobile devices.
The move by HP, the world's second-largest personal computer maker and one of the largest tech companies in the US, is the latest development in the sector, based on the belief that niche companies perform better.
Arsenal captain Mikel Arteta says his team-mates should support injured Jack Wilshere ahead of game with Dynamo Zagreb
In the conversation with Wilshere, Wenger also stressed that it is only September and that if Wilshere's recovery goes according to plan, there is nothing to stop him returning to play by Christmas.
In the best of circumstances, Wilshere is certain to miss at least the next four England games and, given what has happened, his participation in next summer's European Championship remains in doubt.
What is most galling about this recent problem is that Wilshere finished the previous season confidently with a single ankle injury and was set to return to his usual aggressive style of play during pre-season training.
Wenger: "This injury is not threatening his career."
It's just not a fully healed bone.
Nothing serious.
It's just an accident.
It has nothing to do with his ankles or the injuries he has had before.
It may be medically related but, as Wenger also admitted, there is a concomitant risk of further injury for any player returning to play in the middle of the season.
There is also an unfavorable trend.
According to Premier Injuries Ltd, Wilshire has 23 different injuries in the six years since his debut.
In addition, he has played in only 65 of Arsenal's 157 league games in the last five seasons.
Looking at the bigger picture for Arsenal, it is clear that in six of the eight seasons since 2007-08, Arsenal have been one of the two Premier League clubs with the most missed days due to injury.
Wenger admits he is likely to be stuck in a vicious circle, but Arsenal believe the improvement in injury statistics last season will continue.
"Sometimes when you come back from injury, you are vulnerable for a while - during that time you need to recover and gain a competitive advantage," said Wenger.
Jack is young enough to cope.
I hope he recovers physically, I am confident in that, and I am confident that his career will be as it deserves.
Arsenal begin their Champions League campaign on Wednesday with a match against Dynamo Zagreb, followed by games against Chelsea on Saturday and Tottenham Hotspur next Wednesday, and Wenger intends to rotate the squad.
Hector Bellerin and Aaron Ramsey did not travel to Croatia, so Mathieu Debuchy and Arteta are likely to feature in the starting line-up.
Perhaps Wenger will also bring in Kieran Gibbs and Olivier Giroud in place of Nacho Monreal and Theo Walcott.
"I try to keep the balance and give a little respite to the players who need it," said Wenger.
While Arsenal are clear favourites in Group F, Zagreb's Maksimir Stadium is among the most disappointing in Europe.
Dynamo have not lost any of their 41 matches since they managed to spend last season as "Invincibles."
On Tuesday night, the stadium was hit by a 3.2-magnitude earthquake on the Richter scale.
It was the 10th in Zagreb this year.
Wenger is confident that Arsenal have learned the lesson of last season, when the team suffered a Champions League defeat by Monaco, and remain with faint hopes of leading the club to victory in the FA Cup final.
"It's an incredible drive," said Wenger.
Arsenal have never done that before.
We were very close in 2006, but on the other hand, I am a realist with experience.
We have ambitions, but we are not dreamers.
FriendsFest: A comedy show that taught us serious lessons in male friendship
The absence of such stories is striking, especially given how desperate men's need for candor has become, now more than ever, with suicide rates among young men at a 15-year high.
In 2013, it was the single biggest cause of death for men aged between 20 and 45 in the UK, and men are three times more likely to die than women.
In an effort to address the problem, the Campaign Against Unhappiness has declared 2015 the Year of Men to challenge a culture that prevents men from seeking help when they need it.
Friendship is at the heart of this battle to rise to the challenge.
A recent study of more than 2,000 university students showing symptoms of depression found that if a patient has enough friends "in a normal mood," the chances of recovery are doubled.
Similarly, for those who are not depressed, a circle of healthy friends halves the chance of mental illness.
But, of course, for friendship to work, first of all it must be there.
In an age when communications are controlled by social media, when style is preferred to content, responsiveness is often valued more than meaningful contact.
Our digital life doubles the need to seem strong, fun-loving, and successful, even if the reality is loneliness.
Such superficial success depends on what psychologists call external values - money, image, social status - entirely at the expense of internal values, our inner pursuit of personal growth and friendship, which have a greater impact on our mental health.
And, as one billionaire video game maker recently observed, money can never buy more happiness.
The merit of Friends is that they draw attention to it.
Each of the characters was not defined by his or her work, but rather by his or her personality, which manifested itself in his or her interactions with friends.
Joey's humor and Chandler's constant hugs, moments of watching football in comfy chairs, Ross sighing at Rachel - all come from the understanding that men can feel it, even if they often refrain from fully exploring their feelings.
As a Samaritans worker told me:... "my role as a listener for people who are depressed and suicidal highlights how even the smallest interaction of friends can be beneficial."
Often, the men who turn to us feel unable to talk to their friends.
The old admonition of "live with it" is strong, as is the feeling that talking openly about problems can be perceived as weakness. "
Friends is one of those shows that comes to mind when I try to suggest longer-lasting coping mechanisms.
It highlighted the inconspicuous moments of male friendship.
As for my task, being an outsider on the phone helps people in moments of despair, while long-term support comes from a close circle of family and friends.
So, if you visit FriendsFest at Comedy Central this weekend, where the scenery has been completely restored for the celebration, why not take your friends for a drink at Central Perk.
Or, better yet, if you see a lonely person in a Starbucks, smile and say "Hello."
It is impossible to guess in advance what good friendship can do.
The Friends series is shown on Comedy Central from start to finish, all 236 episodes, under the tag # FriendsFest
Di Maria scores a goal to help PSG defeat Malmo
Angel di Maria celebrates scoring against Malmo alongside Blaise Matuidi and Edinson Cavani.
Angel di Maria, making his Champions League debut, scored the goal that allowed PSG to easily beat Malmo on Tuesday.
Here is the match report and reaction to the game.
Angel di Maria and Edinson Cavani did their job as Paris Saint-Germain began their Champions League campaign with a hugely comfortable 2-0 win against Malmo at the Parc des Princes on Tuesday.
Di Maria scored less than four minutes into his first Champions League game as a PSG player to set the French champions on their way, but they missed a number of opportunities before finally increasing their advantage when Cavani scored in the 61st minute.
Along with Real Madrid and Shakhtar Donetsk in Group A, Paris needed to get off to a good start against the Swedish champions, as they aimed not to qualify for the play-offs, but to continue a run of successful games over the last three seasons, where they reached the quarter-finals.
They earned points, but at the same time it was not the best decision by Laurent Blanc to consider Zlatan Ibrahimovic useless in attack and later to replace him on the pitch in a game against a team from his hometown and the club where he began his brilliant career in 1999.
"It's not easy to win at home or away in the Champions League, so to win 2-0, cause opponents problems and play well defensively is a good start, even if there are still points we need to work on over the course of the season," Blanc said.
This is promising.
We wanted to win and we did, although I regret we didn't score one or two more goals.
Ibrahimovic returned from injury in one of the substitutions in the 2-2 draw with Bordeaux in Ligue 1 at the weekend, but was marginalised by Di Maria in the fourth minute.
The Argentine striker has been hailed as a player capable of taking PSG to a new level in Europe after being bought from Manchester United last month, and he proved why when he ran onto a pass from Marco Verratti behind the Malmö defence and finished the attack beautifully, sending the ball past Johan Willand into the far corner of the goal.
However, if anyone expected an easy and big victory from PSG back then, they had to be disappointed.
Malmö, who beat Celtic in the play-offs to reach this stage with nine world-class players on the pitch at the start of the game, five defenders and two holding midfielders in midfield, were serious opponents.
But, with the exception of Nikola Djordjic's strike, when the ball flew past the far post of Kevin Trapp's goal in the 34th minute, they did not attack much.
But PSG let themselves down at times with ineffective assists and weak attacks, especially from Ibrahimovic, who failed to score at least five tries in the first half, and then failed to handle the ball Cavani scored just after the resumption of play.
However, he proved far more adept at accurate passes and it was a pass from Ibrahimovic that Di Maria sent a curled shot that went against the bar past Wieland in the 52nd minute.
The second goal was finally scored after the hour mark thanks to Cavani, the Uruguayan scoring his sixth goal of the season after Ibrahimovic adjusted a ball sent into the centre of the pitch from Maxwell's left flank.
This put an end to any idea Malmö had of getting back into the game, and only Wieland's interception of the ball from close range prevented David Luiz from extending the final score before substitute Ezequiel Lavessi was credited with a goal at the very end of the match.
Malmo coach Age Hareide later admitted PSG were a class above his team, with the Norwegian saying: "Our last game in the Champions League was last December."
Since then we have only played in the Swedish league and that is not the level.
Qualification is not enough.
Glory to "Paris"!
It was a wonderful match against them.
Glencore earns $2.5 billion in share sale
Swiss-based mining and trading giant Glencore, hit by falling commodity prices, has made $2.5 billion selling shares as part of its ambitious debt-reduction plan.
Glencore, listed on the London Stock Exchange, said it had sold about £1.6 billion worth of new shares to repay debt.
The company, which has lost 57 percent of its market value, is struggling to cope with the collapse in commodity prices as China's economic slowdown worsens demand and wreaks havoc on global markets.
Thanks to the issue of new shares at a discount price, Glencore's share price on the London Stock Exchange soared in early morning trading on Wednesday.
The shares jumped 2.77 per cent to 131.60 pence on the FTSE 100 index, which was trading 0.69 per cent higher at the opening.
Glencore last week began selling $2.5 billion worth of shares as part of a broad plan to reduce its $30 billion debt by about a third.
The company was selling new shares at 125 cents apiece, a 2.4 percent discount to the closing price on Tuesday.
It issued 1.3 billion new shares, or 9.99 percent of the company's charter capital.
Fears of a continued slowdown in the Chinese economy have reduced the value of iron ore by about half, while coal, copper, and other raw materials have fallen by 20-40 per cent.
White House confirms Xi Jinping visit to Washington
The White House on Tuesday confirmed in an official statement that Chinese President Xi Jinping will be on an official visit to the United States at the end of this month.
The visit - Xi's first to Washington - will take place on September 25 and will be a return visit to President Barack Obama's visit to Beijing last November, the statement said.
The US president and first lady Michelle Obama will also host Xi Jinping and wife Peng Liyuan at a government dinner later in the day, after the two leaders hold bilateral talks.
"President Xi Jinping's visit will provide an opportunity to enhance cooperation between the US and China on common, regional and bilateral issues of interest to both sides, as well as allow the US and Chinese presidents to engage constructively on contentious issues," the statement said.
Xi, whose visit was first announced in February, is expected to stop in Seattle to meet with the heads of several leading US technology companies on his way to Washington, before heading to New York for the United Nations General Assembly in September.
Obama and Xi are expected to discuss a number of contentious issues, including Washington's concerns about alleged Chinese cyber espionage and China's growing assertiveness over disputed waters in the South China Sea.
The biker who shot down a biker on Kutuzovsky lichach received 2 years in a penal colony.
In addition, the court partially granted the civil claims of the victims against Denis Mirzoyev in the amount of 1.2 million roubles.
Dorogomilovsky court in Moscow has sentenced Denis Mirzoyev, who knocked a motorcyclist to death on Kutuzovsky Prospekt in Moscow.
According to "Russian News Service," Mirzoev received a punishment in the form of two years of imprisonment in a penal colony.
He was found guilty under the article "Violation of traffic rules and operation of vehicles" of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation.
In addition, the court partially granted the civil claims of the victims in the amount of 1.2 million roubles.
During the arguments of the parties, the prosecutor asked Mirzoev to be sentenced to three years in prison and to recover from him the claims of the victims in full - eight million roubles.
The accident in question occurred on May 22 at around 3 a.m. in the vicinity of house 30 on Kutuzovsky Prospekt.
The BMW driven by Mirzoev crossed the oncoming lane and hit a motorcyclist who was standing on the side of the road.
The man, born in 1989, died at the scene from his injuries.
Friends of the victim said on social media that the driver of the BMW was travelling at high speed and had gone into the oncoming lane before the accident.
Fearing that the driver would try to evade responsibility, the bikers organized a motorcycle ride from the Vorobyevye Gory to the building of the Central Directorate of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Moscow at 38 Petrovka Street.
Soon after, it became known that the investigation as a result of questioning had detained the alleged culprit of the accident.
In Moscow, a naked man who entered the church was detained.
He was calm and did not commit any illegal acts, and the police referred him to emergency psychiatric doctors.
Officers of the Metropolitan Police detained a resident of Moscow who entered one of the churches without clothes.
This is reported by the agency "Moscow."
According to Andrei Galiakberov, Head of the Press Service of the Main Directorate of the Ministry of the Interior for Moscow, the incident took place on Tuesday, September 15, at around 4 p.m., on Kashirskoye highway.
A naked man entered St. Nicholas Church.
He behaved calmly and did not commit any illegal acts.
A police squad was called to the scene.
Law enforcement officers waited for doctors from the mental health emergency team and handed over the man to them.
It turned out to be a 26-year-old resident of Moscow.
Vladimir Yakushev signed more than 40 resolutions and orders.
More than 40 resolutions and orders were signed by the Governor of Tyumen Region, Vladimir Yakushev, at a meeting of the Presidium of the regional government.
Some of them concerned the allocation of funds for educational and medical institutions in the municipalities of the region.
In particular, funds were allocated for the purchase of a bus for one of the schools in Nizhnetavdinsky District and for major repairs to the regional hospital in Kazan District.
As stated in the accompanying documents, the money will be used to complete the overhaul of the second floor of the therapeutic ward.
There will be repairs to hot and cold water supply networks, water disposal systems, electricity networks and electrical equipment, ventilation systems, the facade of the building will be tidied up, premises will be repaired, and a range of measures on fire safety and energy conservation will be implemented.
Sochi will host the second forum of regions of Russia and Belarus.
On September 17-18, Sochi will host the second forum of regions of Russia and Belarus, which will be attended by a Tyumen delegation headed by the Governor.
The Honorary Consul General of the Republic of Belarus in Tyumen, Vladimir Shugol, who was a member of the official delegation, talks about the upcoming event in Sochi and the interim results of cooperation.
Vladimir Fedorovich, what tasks does the Sochi Forum set?
The large-scale event in Sochi reflects the industrial policy of the Union State.
It is built on fruitful cooperation between the regions - important links in relations between the two states.
It is planned that Russian President Vladimir Putin and President of the Republic of Belarus Alexander Lukashenko will take part in the plenary session.
The plenary and breakout sessions will focus on the experience of regional and local authorities of Russia and Belarus in implementing industrial policy, regulatory support and programs of the Union State.
The Governor of Tyumen Region will address the forum.
I think that this testifies to successful, sustainable interregional cooperation between the region and Belarus.
Representatives of relevant ministries and agencies, Russian and Belarusian entrepreneurs will also attend the forum.
Trade fairs and specialized exhibitions, including those from the Tyumen region, will be held.
I hope that the forum will help to conclude new profitable contracts and agreements.
I would add that the first such meeting took place in Minsk in June last year.
It was attended by more than two hundred delegates, including from 19 regions of Russia.
At the same time, a very important cooperation agreement was signed between Tyumen and Minsk Oblasts.
The significance of our achievements is also demonstrated by the fact that a meeting of the permanent seminar at the Parliamentary Assembly of the Union of Russia and Belarus was held in Tyumen.
In addition, a delegation from the agro-industrial complex of the Tyumen region visited the Republic of Belarus to study the experience of Belarusians in training personnel for agriculture, identify additional points of contact, and organize new investment projects in the agro-industrial sector.
Recently, you met with the head of the region and the head of the city administration.
What topics were discussed?
During the meeting with Governor of Tyumen Oblast Vladimir Yakushev, the issue was about cooperation between the region and the Republic of Belarus in today's difficult conditions.
The issue of the supply of Belarusian agricultural machinery and the use of financial mechanisms will be raised: they are needed to reduce the cost of machines for the final consumer.
Problems in the operation of the Tyumen trading house Belshina and options for preventing losses were discussed.
The issues are important, because investment projects should work well and bring benefits to the region.
They talked about further supplies of passenger and cargo vehicles of OAO MAZ, and the development of the service center of OAO MAZ, which was created in Tyumen on the basis of OAO TPAP.
The conversation also touched upon preparations for the visit of the working delegation of the region to the Republic of Belarus by the end of this year.
Another topic of conversation was the completion of the coordination and signing of an agreement on trade and economic, scientific, technical, and cultural cooperation between Tyumen Oblast and the Republic of Belarus.
Thus, the dynamics of the relationship promise to reach a new level.
These questions applied to the regional center as well.
During a meeting with the head of the Tyumen city administration, Alexander Moore, we spoke about the renovation of the Tyumen bus fleet.
About 100 buses are already "breathing in incense," which is why a new batch of vehicles from Belarus is needed, which will run on gas and environmentally friendly fuel.
Another aspect: Tyumen Lift Plant cooperates with one of the leading manufacturers of elevator products, OAO Mogilevliftmash, by receiving components.
In my opinion, this activity could become more active, taking into account the programs to install new elevators in the regional center.
I should add that within the framework of the consul's extended powers, a meeting was held with Governor of Kurgan Oblast Alexei Kokorin, during which the issue of increasing trade turnover and the supply of modern Belarusian equipment to Zauralye was discussed.
A meeting with the Governor of Omsk is scheduled for the end of September.
The expanded consular district includes five subjects of the Russian Federation, but Tyumen can be called a peculiar headquarters of the district.
The region is a testing ground for many promising projects, including the work of the Honorary Consul General.
In general, such meetings are significant and good in that they allow for the direct and rapid solution of many problems, alleviating their severity and developing mutually beneficial cooperation.
In the current environment, it is essential not to destroy the momentum by continuing to work for the long term.
Matt Damon opposes focusing on ethnic diversity in film production
Matt Damon took issue with African-American producer Effie Brown, saying behind the scenes that ethnic composition should not be taken into account.
During Sunday's edition of Project Greenlight on HBO, the acclaimed actor interrupted Brown as she tried to highlight the need for alternative perspectives on the main black character in the script chosen for the project.
"Diversity is appropriate when you're casting for a movie, not a show," Damon insisted.
A stunned Brown, unable to believe her ears, exclaimed offensively, "Wow, wow, wow," the entire time the "Martian" actor was giving comments live on air.
Damon and Brown were joined by fellow producers Ben Affleck and the Farelli brothers to discuss the show's finalists.
"I would like participants - no matter who the director is - to think about how they interpret the image of Harmony," Brown said at the start of the discussion.
The only black character is a prostitute who is beaten by a white pimp.
The producer of Dear White People advocated that the film be directed by Leo Angelos and Kristen Brancaccio; Damon was strongly opposed, saying that "in the end we may not get what we want."
After the discussion aired on television, social media exploded with disapproving comments about Damon.
Twitter user MrPooni angrily commented on the video, saying: 'Explanation of diversity from Matt Damon to the only black person in the room is SO WHITE, which hurts.'
The tweet received more than 5,000 retweets and 4,000 "likes."
Damon's remarks come at a time when race-sensitive media coverage is at the top of the public debate.
After a teenager named Michael Brown was shot dead by a police officer in 2014, the Black Lives Matter movement gained traction across the country, calling on lawmakers and governments to stop discriminatory practices against people of color.
In February, singer Prince referenced the movement during his presentation of Album of the Year nominees at the Grammy Awards.
"Albums still matter," he said.
Like the books and lives of black people, the albums still matter.
More recently, Black Lives Matter leaders issued an official statement in response to a question from Fox News contributor Elizabeth Hasselbeck about whether the group would be viewed as a hate group.
"Black Lives Matter is a love group," the movement's leaders said.
It was recently announced that Damon is among a list of showbiz figures, producers, and media moguls invited to visit the Pope to discuss the image of the Catholic Church in the West.
It is not known whether the actor accepted the invitation or met with the Pope.
"American Ninja Warrior" Honors First Champion
Professional rock climber and waiter Isaac Caldiero became the first winner of "American Ninja Warrior" on Monday night, taking home the $1 million prize.
On this sports show, the 7th season of which has just ended, none of the participants have yet managed to complete all the stages of the steeplechase course.
In the season finale, two contestants, Caldiero and cameraman Jeff Britten, made it through to the final round.
The final task involved climbing a 75-foot-long rope in 30 seconds.
Britten was first up and on target, becoming the first athlete in American Ninja Warrior history to complete the grueling stage 4, but Caldiero managed to complete the task a full three seconds faster, making him the winner.
After the hard-fought win, Caldiero, who was shocked to win a million dollars, gave an interview to E! News.
"To think about it is unbelievable, I've never earned or lived on more than $10,000 a year," Isaac told E! of such a big jump in his income.
Suddenly it's like this... I never had any idea how it happened... the future is unknown.
Executive producer Kent Weed met with The Hollywood Reporter to talk about the finale and why Britten, who first walked the track, would not receive any cash prize.
According to the rules, the fastest participant gets the money.
"If there is more than one finisher, the prize goes to the fastest player," Weed said.
Although money is a wonderful reward and life-changing, he still gets a lot of satisfaction.
I don't think he feels aggrieved about it.
He's happy with what he's done.
He received tons of rave reviews from fans.
He is a wonderful man and a family man.
He is a hero to his children and wife.
Jeff told me, "If I was going to lose to someone, I'm glad it's Isaac."
And I think Isaac would feel the same if we switched roles.
The show, "America Ninja Warrior," will return with an eighth season, which will begin shooting in the spring of 2016.
Detroit Tigers quietly bypass Minnesota Twins
MINNEAPOLIS - The second half of the season hasn't been particularly fun for the Detroit Tigers.
One of the best baseball teams ever, the Tigers now rank last in the American League Central Division.
Claiming only to be a nuisance, the Tigers beat the Minnesota Twins 5-4 at Target Field on Tuesday.
The Twins missed a chance to close the half-game gap on the Houston Astros and finish second in the playoffs in points behind the winners.
For the Detroit Tigers, even for one night, it was the return of the F-word that had eluded them for most of the second half of the season.
"All the wins are fun, no matter how they turn out," Tigers manager Brad Ausmus said.
Tigers pitcher Alfredo Simon did his part to shore up the offense, leading Detroit to three points in the first two innings, then added another in the sixth and one in the ninth.
Simon (13-9) was a pitcher in 6 1 / 3 innings and allowed three runs.
It was only his third quality start in nine outings.
"I just want to end the year with a good performance," Simon said.
The replacement pitchers don't throw in every game, so I want to go deeper into the game.
Tigers designated hitter Victor Martinez struck out three and struck out two - his first RBI since mid-August.
It was the first three-strike day since a four-hit game against the Seattle Mariners on July 6.
"He worked well with the bat," Osmus said.
He did a good job (as a batter), was noticeably better with the bat and kept that quality for the game.
After scoring three runs in the second half of the seventh inning, the Twins got their best chance to get back in the game.
Central receiver Byron Buxton opened the inning with a double down the left field line.
Wrightfielder Aaron Hicks took first base with a bow, and second baseman Brian Dozier got a strikeout on a swing from Simon before left-hander Blaine Hardy took his place.
Hardy walked Moer, the only player on the way, ahead of newly designated hitter Miguel Sano, who hit a two-run single to left off right-hander Drew Verhagen.
With a pair of runners out and a comparative injury at second base, Verhoeven managed to lead third baseman Trevor Plouffe to a double play.
It was the 27th time for the major league's leading player this season when Plouffe knocked the ball out for a double play.
After Detroit added a run-scoring double in the first half of the ninth inning, Moher earned an RBI double in the space between outfielders against Tigers closer Bruce Rondon, and the score was 5-4.
However, the right-handed player struck out Sano after three strikeouts and got his fifth save.
Detroit took advantage of the suspension of Phil Hughes early in the game.
The Tigers earned three runs in the first two innings against a deserving pitcher who was on the injury list until the game, missing more than a month because of lower back inflammation.
"Definitely not the start I wanted," said Hughes, "but as the game progressed I felt more comfortable and so I was able to make some pretty good throws in the third inning."
After the first batter reached first base, Hughes threw a single to second baseman Ian Kinsler.
Wake with two outs by right-fielder J.D. Martinez led off Victor Martinez, who singled down the middle for the first run of the game.
Victor Martinez finished 0 for 21 with runners in scoring position.
Third-base player Nick Castellanos followed with a single, bringing another hit, but Victor Martinez was knocked out in an attempt to get closer to third base, eliminating the threat.
The Tigers increased the score in the second inning, getting a one-out double from catcher James McCann and a two-out single from center fielder Anthony Ghose to make it 3-0.
"It was a massive hit," Twins manager Paul Molitor said.
He didn't hit particularly well, but he hit the right spot.
Hughes, whose throws were counted, threw in a scoreless third inning before being replaced by right-handed reliever A.J. Akhter.
Hughes had three hits and a walk with four strikeouts.
NOTES: Tigers right-hander Anibal Sanchez left the game because of a sprained right shoulder.
He will be examined by Dr. James Andrews, who performed shoulder surgery on Sanchez back in 2007.
Sanchez, who has been on the injured list since mid-August, is scheduled to start Wednesday.
In Sanchez's absence, left-handed pitcher Daniel Norris will leave the injured list and come out against the Twins.
Norris, who has made four starts for the Tigers since being acquired in exchange for left-handed pitcher David Price on July 30, has one win and one loss.
He has not played since August 20 due to a oblique muscle strain.
The Tigers and Twins will complete a three-game series at Target Field on Wednesday.
Pitcher Ervin Santana (5-4, ERA 4.73) will play against Norris (2-2, ERA 4.43).
Kadyrov's original complaint, based on the book "Prayer to God," went to the Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk Court.
The Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk City Court received the original appeal of the representative of the President of Chechnya, Ramzan Kadyrov, against the decision to recognize as "extremist material" the book "Prayer to God: Its Meaning and Place in Islam," Interfax reports, with reference to the chairman of the City Court, Alexander Chukhrai.
Now the court is waiting for possible objections of participants in the process.
Chukhray refused to comment on the statements of some deputies of the State Duma of the Russian Federation about the need to check the City Court for possible cooperation with foreign intelligence services and ISIS.
"Let them comment on such stupidity," he said.
On September 11, the Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk City Prosecutor's Office filed an appeal against Judge Natalia Perchenko's decision to declare the book "extremist material."
The Prosecutor's Office of Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk filed an appeal on Friday evening.
There are nuances: the prosecutor's office believes that they asked the court to recognize as extremist only the opinion of the author of this book, not verses from the Koran.
According to the prosecutor's office, the judge made the wrong decision, "Chukhray said.
The decision to declare the book "extremist material" was taken on 12 August 2015.
In particular, quotations from the Koran - "We worship you and pray for your help," "Do not call on anyone besides Allah" - were described as "extremist."
Kadyrov called those who decided on the book "shaytans and provocateurs."
He called on the State Duma deputies to legislate to prohibit court decisions concerning the texts of holy scriptures.
"I firmly believe that the State Duma should pass a law prohibiting judicial decisions directly related to the Koran and other divine scriptures," Kadyrov wrote on his Instagram account.
Facebook to remove comments insulting migrants and refugees
Facebook employees intend to remove posts and comments that make negative comments about migrants and refugees.
In addition, the social network will provide financial support to organizations that collect complaints from users about illegal content.
The management of Facebook intends to combat xenophobia and racism on the network in cooperation with the German Ministry of Justice.
Thus, the day before, the Minister of Justice Heiko Maas stated that currently the Ministry of Justice, together with experts from the social network, is engaged in the creation of a special group of moderators.
Participants are obliged to monitor and remove inappropriate comments about migrants and refugees.
According to Heiko Maas, it is assumed that the authors of intolerant posts will receive notifications indicating the reason for deleting their posts.
Organizations whose experts collect complaints from users of social networks about offensive posts should also facilitate the prompt blocking of illegal content.
Facebook's management intends to provide them with the necessary financial support.
The decision to remove posts containing negative comments about migrants and refugees was made by the management of the social network and the German Ministry of Justice after xenophobic sentiments in the German segment of Facebook had risen sharply.
One of the most obvious causes was the unprecedented scale of the migration crisis that engulfed the EU some time ago.
In Germany, for example, all accommodation facilities for refugees are already overcrowded.
On the eve of the country's authorities decided to temporarily settle migrants in the territory of the former Buchenwald concentration camp.
Internally displaced persons from the Middle East and Africa are housed in barracks where prisoners and prisoners of war were held under the Nazi regime.
Relaxation areas will appear in Moscow cemeteries.
In the near future, several cemeteries in the capital will be equipped with specialized areas for relaxation and psychological rest.
Among the first will be Butovskoye, Domodedovo, and Shcherbinskoye Cemetery.
The first zone for psychological rest has already appeared at Troekurovsky Cemetery in Moscow.
In the future, similar sites will appear in other parts of the city.
Artem Ekimov, who holds the position of Head of the State Budget Institution "Ritual," told m24.ru about this.
Relaxation areas will consist of small green areas resembling parks.
According to experts, in such "corners" visitors to cemeteries will be able to rest, be alone with themselves and regain psychological strength.
In the near future, relaxation areas will be built in Domodedovo, Butovsky and Shcherbinsky cemeteries, and then in other districts of the capital.
According to the head of the State Budget-Funded Institution "Ritual," if the need arises to expand the area of the cemetery, the builders will try to preserve the existing forest areas to the maximum extent possible.
The greenery will serve as a living fence, which will separate the recreation areas and the areas set aside directly for burial sites.
Experts of the State Budgetary Institution "Ritual" also announced their intention to make a proposal on the rejection of hedges at burials.
New cemeteries may indeed become barrier-free.
In addition, the State Budgetary Institution "Ritual" reported on its readiness to install electronic terminals, with the help of which visitors to cemeteries will be able to find out the GPS-coordinates and number plates of graves.
In June of this year, the State Budget-Funded Institution "Ritual" also proposed to adjust the cost of burial services depending on the time of year.
Thus, digging a grave in the summer will cost a thousand roubles less than in the winter, when the ground is frozen.
It should be noted that over the past year, prices for all kinds of ritual services have increased by an average of 10 percent.
Five days later, a stray fungus was found in the Yelninsky forest.
The elderly man turned out to be alive, though he spent more than a hundred hours in the woods without food.
The discovery of the fungus mountain was made possible thanks to the joint efforts of rescuers and volunteers.
Alexander Blinnikov, correspondent: "A 79-year-old pensioner from Tambov region spent five days in the forest."
No food or water.
Relatives, rescuers, and volunteers were searching for him.
There were even dog handlers with dogs, but to no avail.
The man was located after a helicopter joined the search.
That day, Vitaly Alexandrovich, as usual, went to the forest to pick up spines and birches, but by the evening he did not return.
Relatives immediately appealed for help, and the next day rescuers and concerned residents from a nearby village - about 30 people in all - arrived to search for the fungus.
On the fifth day, they were joined by a helicopter from the fire and rescue centre.
Andrei Seletkov, Head of the Search and Rescue Group of the Smolensk Region Fire and Rescue Centre, said: "The helicopter was brought in and the man was found."
He has gone very far, very differently.
It was about 12 kilometers from the search site.
He has travelled a huge distance at his age.
Miraculously, he survived.
Gribnik was taken to Elninsk Central District Hospital unconscious and in an extremely serious condition.
Medics diagnosed him with pneumonia, as well as severe dehydration and hypothermia.
Doctors have no idea how the elderly man managed to survive after spending five days in the forest.
Valentina Nepsha, Head of the Therapeutic Department of the Yelnina Central Medical Center: "An examination of the patient and treatment have been assigned."
Infusion therapy, antibacterial.
Given all his chronic illnesses.
The patient's condition improved in the morning, remains serious, but with positive dynamics.
Pensioner Vitaly Alexandrovich comes to Smolensk region every year from Tambov region.
His grandson says his grandfather used to go mushroom picking, but never went deep into the forest.
Alexei Spitchenko, grandson of the found fungus, shared: "The forest is not far from the road, in principle it is not local."
Literally for several years I came to visit my relatives.
Well, he went for mushrooms.
Apparently, he went a long way and got lost.
With the beginning of the mushroom season, people are regularly lost in all areas of the Smolensk region.
In the last few days alone, there have been five similar cases.
Rescuers remind us that it is necessary to go to the forest in bright clothes, with a small supply of food, matches and a compass.
It is also advisable to leave footprints so that you can go back later.
The emergency An-2 sat on a clearing in the fraternal taiga.
The emergency An-2 landed in Siberia right on the cutting-edge.
The plane of Krasnoyarsk airline Yenisey made an emergency landing 68 kilometers from Bratsk.
There were no fatalities or injuries, but the plane itself sustained significant damage on landing.
An-2 was on an official flight.
It had three crew members on board - a commander, a co-pilot and a flight mechanic, Interfax reports.
The emergency plane was flying on the Zheleznogorsk-Ilimsky-Achinsk route, where the airline is based.
The crew of the plane has already been delivered to Bratsk.
The Fraternal Transport Prosecutor's Office, after the An-2 emergency landing, began an audit of compliance with flight safety legislation.
An investigative team from the East Siberian Transport Prosecutor's Office went to the scene of the incident.
In September 2010, the Tu-154 crew landed their plane with passengers on an abandoned taiga airfield in Komi due to a technical fault.
Engines and on-board electronics failed on the liner, but the crew did the impossible.
The plane was carrying 10 crew members and 72 passengers.
No one was injured during the emergency landing.
Leading Economics - Nobel Laureate: Globalization
Globalization was supposed to reduce inequality in the world.
In fact, the situation is different; income disparities in emerging economies, on the contrary, are widening.
Eric Maskin.
To correct this, it is necessary to raise the level of education of low-skilled workers, according to Eric Maskin, Chief Researcher of the International Laboratory for Analysis and Choice of Solutions at HSE, 2007 Nobel Prize winner in economics.
In the last twenty years, the world has experienced unprecedented growth in global markets.
Trade borders between countries became increasingly open.
Advocates of globalization predicted large benefits for emerging economies.
"In many ways, those predictions have come true," Maskin said.
China and India, for example, have experienced strong per capita GDP growth.
But not everything is rosy.
Globalization was expected to narrow the gap between the "haves" and the "have-nots" in poor countries, reflected in large income, or rather wage, inequality.
But, in fact, these inequalities have only increased, notes Eric Maskin in his article "Why Global Markets Have Not Reduced Inequality in Emerging Economies," published in The World Bank Economic Review, translated and quoted by HSE's NIE.
Together with Harvard University economist Michael Kremer, Eric Maskin has developed an alternative theory that demonstrates why income disparities in poor countries increase with globalization, reminiscent of HSE's NIE.
Specific processes are taking place in the new global market.
To demonstrate them, Maskin identifies four skill levels - A and B for rich countries, C and D for poor countries.
After globalization, D-s from poor countries lack the skills to match A-s and B's from rich countries.
And while C-level workers from poor countries are getting a pay rise thanks to co-operation with B-level workers from rich countries, D-level workers are getting little or no pay rise.
The net effect is that the internationalization of production will widen the wage gap between the two categories of professionals in poor countries and thus increase inequality.
Kremer and E. Maskin proposed a surprisingly beautiful model, an alternative to Ricardian theory of comparative advantage.
It helps to explain why globalization has led to income inequality, says Fuad Aleskerov, Professor Ordinary, Head of the International Laboratory of Analysis and Decision Choice, Head of the Department of Mathematics at HSE.
And like any powerful theory, I am sure it will lead to a surge of empirical work in this area.
The solution, according to Eric Maskin, is to improve the education of low-skilled workers.
However, as the scientist notes, the workers themselves do not have the means to do so, and it is unprofitable for companies to pay for their training.
In such a situation, governments, international agencies, NGOs, and private foundations can play a significant role, Maskin said.
The scientist notes that the theory does not in any way call for halting the process of globalization, which has brought and continues to bring benefits in terms of countries "GDP growth.
Derbent: a living connection of the times.
Derbent - one of the most ancient cities in Russia - celebrates its 2000 anniversary in September.
The program of celebrations includes a festival of national cultures of the peoples of Dagestan and a fair in the style of past times, an exhibition of Derbent carpets and an Open Church Day, a historical and musical show "2,000 years in two hours," and excursions to the renovated Peter the Great Museum.
The medieval stones of the Naryn-Kala fortress, ancient Arabic inscriptions on the walls, narrow streets and palace gardens all seem to have disappeared from the pages of Thousand and One Nights.
Derbent is the only city in Russia that has survived in its place since ancient times.
Though it was claimed by the Roman Empire, Byzantium, Khazar Haganat and the Golden Horde.
The eastern plane trees, which grow in the courtyard of Derbent's Juma Mosque, are several centuries old.
These powerful plants are under the protection of the All-Russian Program "Trees - Monuments of Wildlife."
The shade of sprawling crowns saves pilgrims and tourists during the summer heat.
Visitors to the mosque will be poured aromatic tea and treated to Dagestan delicacies - honey figs, persimmons, mushmula, miracle tortillas, airan and sweets.
In Derbent, large samovars have been used from time immemorial to provide tea to numerous guests at one time.
The inscription above the entrance to the Juma Mosque says that the building was built in 115 AH.
That is, in 733 according to the Gregorian calendar.
It is the oldest mosque in Russia.
The interior is striking in scope and solemnity: arcades of domes and vaults rest on square columns and are illuminated by rays of the sun from tiny windows.
Maintaining and breeding pigeons is a traditional hobby of Derbent residents.
Owners of domestic birds put doves in courtyards, under trees, in attics.
A spectacular sight is the rise into the sky of a flock of white doves that look like flashes of celebratory fireworks.
In order to defend themselves against the enemy, the ancient Persians closed the Caspian Gate with a double stone wall.
Going 500 meters into the sea, this structure locked Derbent Harbor.
In 2003, Derbent's fortress walls were inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage List as the best-preserved monument of ancient Persian fortification architecture.
Carpets in Derbent were weaved in the fifth century, and the technology of this unique craft has remained almost unchanged to this day.
On one of the streets adjacent to the city market, carpets are sold for every taste - palaces made of wool, cotton or felt of all colors and shades, with and without wool, with a complex ornament and a bizarre border.
The development of the city began with shops - neighborhoods with one-storey stone buildings.
Over the years, the stores have hardly changed.
Only satellite dishes, air conditioners on the walls, and street lamps remind you that you are not in a medieval city, but in a modern one.
In the old part of the city, the details of a water pipe built by the Persians about a thousand years ago have been preserved.
To this day, there are ancient springs from which locals still collect water.
Many Derbentians prefer conventional tap water to water from proven historical fountains.
Derbent was home to one of the pottery centres.
Irrigation and painted vases, dishes, jugs, cups were appreciated throughout the Caucasus.
The hands of potters still produce wonderful ceramics for both practical and souvenir purposes.
On the days of holidays and festivals, crowds of spectators gather under a tightrope, where pupils of the Republican School of Circus Art perform.
The history of amazing and risky craftsmanship goes back several centuries.
A new trend is that girls are increasingly seen among rope walkers.
The museum "Culture and Life of Ancient Derbent" is now operating in the former Maiden's Baths.
Previously, unmarried girls and brides, accompanied by their girlfriends, bathed here, but now anyone can see the vaulted dome hall, hot and cold pools, and outdated bathing facilities.
Most Derbent houses have hot water, but baths and steam rooms are as popular today as they were in the past.
The benefits of steam heating are written in ancient books.
After the bath, the blood improves, the muscles lose fatigue, and the body acquires flexibility and lightness.
The festival "Commonwealth," which takes place in the Naryn-Kala fortress, is attended by ethno-pastoralists from many districts of Dagestan.
Participants in national costumes dance, play folk tunes, perform songs of the peoples of the Caucasus and treat visitors to delicious homemade cheese.
Kirkhlyar is the burial place of forty martyrs who laid down their heads for Islam.
It is one of the most revered complexes for Muslims in the North Caucasus.
Yellow sarcophagi are carved out of solid stone blocks and orientated along the west-east axis, as is customary among Arabs.
Brothers Gavril and Albert Yakubovs cut and shave clients in a small salon near the Upper Bazaar.
The barber shop has been on this site for many years.
The techniques of barbershop are passed down from generation to generation.
At the same time, the Yakubov brothers can do not only traditional, but also the most modern hairstyle.
On one of the streets of the Old Town, there is a house where Alexander Bestuzhev-Marlinsky, a Decembrist writer exiled to the Caucasus, lived.
Having learned the Turkic language and collected ethnographic material, he described Derbent in the first third of the 19th century with its ancient monuments, life and way of life of citizens.
Chaikhana is a traditional club in the East, where only tea and homemade pastries are served.
Men come here to quench their thirst, socialize with friends, and solve some work problems.
As in the past, women are not recommended to cross the threshold of a chaikhana.
Derbent Dance Ensemble "Caspian" was created three years ago, but has already managed to take part in events at the republican and Russian levels.
The soloists of the ensemble rehearse every day, mastering the folk Avar, Dargin, Tatar, and Armenian dances to perfection.
As evening falls, when the noise subsides and street lamps are lit, locals sit on benches near houses with protruding terraces.
As a rule, Derbenians discuss domestic issues.
But in the run-up to the anniversary, they increasingly recall episodes of their city's unique history, which influenced the fate of the entire Black Sea-Caspian region.
Domodedovo hosted a business "game to the airport."
The capital is experiencing a new form of learning.
Four hundred students tried themselves as airport employees.
For this purpose, models of three aviation harbors were installed in Domodedovo.
Young people not only inspected and registered passengers, but also serviced airplanes.
All of this is in the form of a business game, but in its complexity it was as complex as reality.
Delayed flights, two passengers with fractures on board, a ladder lost somewhere on the way to the plane.
For a real airport, hell.
For those who have settled in Domodedovo hangar, there is a standard set of tasks to be decided by the newcomers.
In one hangar, three major airports from different countries of the world could be accommodated at once.
Today, they employ four hundred students from the capital's colleges and universities.
An unprecedented chance to learn all about the inner world of the airline harbor.
Registration of passengers, servicing of airplanes, baggage turnover - they were entrusted even with buses on the tarmac, ladders and passenger screening.
And the passengers are all problem passengers.
One had a problem with his documents, another was late for a flight, and a third filled his bag with suspicious items.
And it is necessary to deal with all this as in life - in a minimum period of time.
For each of these tasks performed, they are charged a certain amount, virtual money, as if they had been paid by the airline to service the flight.
"For failure to fulfill the relevant tasks, they are liable to a fine," Dmitry Khilko, the game's financial analyst, explains in an interview with Vesti-Moscow.
Officials from the Ministry of Education are keeping a close eye on what is happening.
For them, the exam is an attempt to try out a new form of learning.
She has already found a place in a secondary vocational education course.
"Six interregional competence centers will be formed, which will become, in essence, new models for the activities of modern colleges with a modern management system, highly qualified staff, and modern equipment," says Natalia Zolotareva, Director of the Department of State Policy in the field of worker training and additional vocational education of the Ministry of Education and Science of Russia.
But students don't have to worry about global plans.
After three days of training, it looks like they will need a day off.
On the other hand, the marks for this examination had quite a material expression.
The newest smart glasses, the best I've ever seen!
"I got them because I responded to the complaint against our airport on Instagram in a timely manner," said Sergei Shuvalov, the player and PR manager of the Frankfurt Airport team.
The best judges, so to speak, were taken to a pencil in order to invite them to work by the time they finished their studies.
The US Embassy regrets the closure of the American Center in Moscow.
The American Embassy in Russia expressed regret at the closure of the American Center for Foreign Literature attached to the Library.
The Center has been operating in Moscow for more than 22 years.
The US Embassy in Moscow deeply regrets the Russian government's unilateral decision to close the American Center of the US Embassy at the Rudomino All-Russian State Library in Moscow.
"The unilateral steps taken by the Russian Federation in recent times call into question the Russian government's commitment to the ties between the Russian and American peoples, which have not been interrupted even during the Cold War and other difficult moments in the long history of relations between our countries," US Ambassador John Tefft said in a statement to Interfax.
The American Center created deep and lasting ties between the people and culture of Russia and the United States.
It was the center of American culture, history, and literature in the Russian capital, and served as a meeting place for numerous American personalities, including cosmonauts, artists, athletes, scientists, politicians, and writers.
"Last year alone, the American Center held more than 400 cultural and educational events and received more than 50,000 Russian visitors," the diplomat stressed.
Tefft recalled that about a year ago, a decision was made to close another joint Russian-American project - the Future Leaders Exchange Program (FLEX).
The Green Tribunal was quick to kill.
Typical situation: four officials stand in front of Judge Swatanter Kumar's desk, listening to his grievances about the work done.
The court is not at all satisfied with the quality of your work.
"We didn't give you a 110-page order to make fun of it," Kumar said.
If at least one more brick is laid, we will order the demolition of all existing buildings.
Kumar heads the National Green Tribunal (NTT), a judicial body established in 2010 to halt the rapid environmental pollution that has accompanied rapid economic growth in recent decades.
Since then, the Tribunal has handled more than 10,000 claims related to air pollution, garbage collection, geological exploration, toxic waste, and dam construction.
In two out of three cases, the court orders the cessation of polluting construction.
The stakes are incredibly high: in the less than 60 years since independence, India has transformed itself from a pristine jungle into one of the world's most overcrowded and polluted countries.
The problem is particularly acute in large megacities, where infrastructure development has not kept pace with rapid urbanization: cities are covered in dense smog, rivers are full of pesticides and waste from businesses and households, and the few remaining residential areas are being cut down to make way for new housing developments.
Despite formal government support for the green movement, the NZT is regularly criticized by Narendra Modi's government, as it is often the main reason for the cancellation of major investment projects.
Thus, in May of this year, the Minister of Environment called the court's decisions "extreme" and "unenforceable."
Sometimes, court rulings are indeed impossible to enforce within the court's deadline, confirms environmental lawyer Raj Panjwani.
But impossible deadlines have a silver lining: at least they make those in charge move.
"His main goal is to shake up the system," the lawyer adds.
The Green Tribunal has already repeatedly canceled major construction projects, including the halting of construction of an airport, a power plant, and hundreds of smaller facilities.
At the same time, people are not forgotten either: for example, when discussing the fate of a pharmaceutical company in the state of Telagnana, which polluted a local river with fluoride.
We can close your factory, but we are also responsible for the economic consequences.
"People will lose their jobs," Kumar said of the decision.
However, such explanations are not always understood by ordinary people, whose lives can be changed with the stroke of a judicial pen.
In April, for example, the Tribunal decided to bar all vehicles over the age of 10 from entering the capital, provoking public outrage.
Despite plummeting popularity and a barrage of criticism, Swatanter Kumar refused to reverse the decision.
Instead, he ordered statistics from the Delhi government on incoming and outgoing vehicles, and made a proposal to purchase 10,000 additional buses after asking factories if they could fulfill such an order.
As pollution such as landfills, fuel quality, and even traffic accidents began to come into the court's sights, popular anger began to subside.
But the most painful subject of the principled judge was the Ganges River cleanup program announced with fanfare by Prime Minister Narendra Modi last year.
When it comes to the Ganges, a sacred river for Hindus, the judge often stops holding back his emotions and turns to shouting.
Do you know what the word "holy" means?
"Someone poured water from the Ganges on the statue of God, and faeces were found in it," the judge coos.
You keep polluting the river because you think: the Ganges are the Ganges, he will take away all our sins.
It's a river that we worship, and look what you do with it every day.
Cleaning up the Ganges is the most ambitious and expensive environmental project announced by the new government.
Currently, faecal bacteria in the river are more than 120 times higher than normal.
Every year, between 1.5 and 3 of the 700 million Indians who swim there die from infectious diseases.
In February, Narendra Modi even donated to the Ganges Rescue Fund the proceeds from the sale of his suit in which he met Barack Obama and 455 other items from his personal collection.
Environmentalists immediately accused the premier of populism: the suit was bought for $700,000, while cleaning up the river requires no less than $8 billion.
Supporters of the Green Tribunal agree that India still has a long way to go before it can call itself a developed country, but they do not believe that the price of progress should be the environment.
"In a developing country, talking about the environment is often seen as an unaffordable luxury," says Call of the Ganges activist Malika Bhanot.
And the court is trying to strike a balance between ecology and development. "
A man covered several Dali paintings in blood at an exhibition in Riga.
A visitor to the exhibition of the Latvian Union of Artists in Riga smashed the windows of the museum and damaged Salvador Dali's sculpture The Appearance of an Angel.
The museum is currently hosting an exhibition of works by Salvador Dali and Pablo Picasso.
A man born in 1985 entered the sculpture hall at 14: 20.
He immediately behaved inadequately: damaged the sculpture, smashed the windows.
He then began to move around the premises and covered several of the permanent exhibition's works in blood.
Among them is a portrait of the hand of Miervaldis Polis.
According to Igor Dobychin, President of the Latvian Union of Artists, cited by Interfax, the display cases were also damaged.
Police and art experts are working at the scene.
The latter determine the extent of damage and injury.
A criminal case for hooliganism has been opened against the man.
The Latvian Union of Artists hosts an exhibition of works by Picasso and Dali from 4 August to 27 September, featuring more than 200 original works by artists.

Xi calls for economy to be more open to the world
The economy must become more open to the world to spur growth, President Xi Jinping said Tuesday in an address to a group tasked with leading reforms.
"China should focus on attracting foreign investors and experts and develop a policy of openness," he said, addressing the 16th meeting of the Central Leading Group Committee on Comprehensive Deepening of Reform.
According to him, expanding openness and deepening reforms will give the economy a new impetus and vitality and provide a new space for economic development.
The Leadership Group has adopted a number of directives, including regulating investor access to the market, changing border controls, encouraging SOEs to attract private capital, and revising the resident registration system.
According to the statement, a list of sectors of the economy and production that are unavailable for investment will be drawn up.
The system will be gradually fine-tuned through trial programs.
This is an important step, as it will give the market a greater role in allocating resources, ensuring the rule of law in business and increasing openness, the statement said.
The government will also loosen control over the powers it grants to companies, thereby ensuring that companies conduct their own business.
The statement also said that China will allow border regions to adopt new models of cross-border economic cooperation and new mechanisms to boost local growth.
More areas will be made available to private investors in order to increase the openness of state-controlled sectors of the economy.
"The government will not change its policy towards foreign investors and will protect the legitimate interests of foreign-financed companies and provide them with better conditions," the statement said.
In addition, the procedure for applying for permanent residence permits for foreigners, or "green cards," will be facilitated by streamlining the requirements and simplifying the application process itself.
The meeting also discussed ensuring the rights of lawyers and the training of professional judges and prosecutors.
According to an official report released after the meeting, Premier Li Keqiang and Ministers Liu Yunshan and Zhang Gaoli were also present.
