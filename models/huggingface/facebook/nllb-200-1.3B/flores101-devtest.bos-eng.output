This not only confirms that some dinosaurs had feathers, which is already a known theory, but it also provides details that fossils usually cannot provide, relating to color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists say that the feathers of this animal were chestnut-brown at the top, with a pale or yellow-orange-red underside.
The discovery also provides insight into the evolution of feathers in birds.
Since dinosaur feathers do not have a well-developed speciality, called a rachis, but have other feather features - spines and tiny spines - the researchers concluded that the rachis was probably part of a later evolutionary development relative to other features.
The structure of these feathers suggests that they were not used for flight, but to regulate temperature or appearance.
Studies have shown that even though this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the pattern shows adult feathers, not chicken feathers.
A car bomb detonated yesterday at the police headquarters in Gaziantep, Turkey, killing two police officers and injuring more than 20 others.
The governor's office said 19 of the injured were police officers.
Police said they suspected an alleged Daesh (ISIL) militant responsible for the attack.
They found that the sun works on the same basic principles as the other stars, and that the activity of all the stars in the system is determined by their luminosity, their rotation, and nothing else.
Luminosity and rotation together are used to determine the Robi number of the star, which is related to the plasma flow.
The smaller the Rosby number, the less active the star is due to the inversions of the magnetic field.

The work done was mostly theoretical in nature, but the program was written to mimic observations of the Sagittarius galaxy.
The effect the team was looking for would be caused by tidal forces between the dark matter of the galaxy and the dark matter of the Milky Way.
Just as the moon pulls the Earth and thereby causes the tide, so the Milky Way is applying a force to the Sagittarius galaxy.
Scientists have been able to conclude that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way that ordinary matter does.
According to this theory, most of the dark matter is around the galaxy in a sort of halo, and it's made up of a lot of tiny particles.

Candidates can send representatives to monitor every part of the process, and in the evening, volunteers count the votes under strict supervision, following specific procedures.

Although three people were in the house when the car hit it, none of them were injured.
However, the driver suffered serious head injuries.
The road on which the collision occurred was temporarily closed while emergency services pulled the driver from the red Audi TT.
He was first admitted to James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was subsequently transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya has since been in Edinburgh Sheriff's Court charged with the murder of her son.
She's in custody awaiting indictment and trial, but any witness evidence can be dismissed because her picture has been published many times.
It's common practice in other parts of the UK, but the Scottish judiciary works differently and the courts have considered that it's possible that publishing a photograph could be harmful.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee notes that "it seems that journalists are really walking a fine line when they publish photos of suspects".
The Crown Office, which is fully responsible for prosecuting, has indicated to reporters that no further comment will be made, at least until the indictment is filed.
The document will, according to leaked information, relate to the border dispute that Palestine wants to base on the borders before the 1967 Middle East war.
Other topics are supposedly the future state of Jerusalem which is sacred to both nations which is a problem in the Jordan Valley.
Israel demands a permanent military presence in this valley for a period of ten years after the signing of the agreement, while the PA accepts a military presence of only five years.
The shooters in the supplemental pest control test program were supposed to be under the watchful eye of the rangers, as the test program was being monitored and its effectiveness evaluated.
In partnership with the NPWS and the Sporting Shooters' Association of Australia (NSW), qualified volunteers were recruited, in line with the sporting shooters' association's hunting programme.
According to Mick O'Flynn, acting director of conservation and park heritage at the NPWS, the four shooters selected for the first shooting operation have been given detailed safety instructions and training.
Yesterday, in the new Provisional Electoral Council (CEP), nine members took the oath of office in front of Martelly.
It's Martelly's fifth CEP in four years.
Last month, the presidential commission suggested that the previous CEP resign as part of a package of measures to move the country toward new elections.
The commission was Martelly's response to widespread protests against the regime that began in October.
At times, violent protests have been triggered by the failure to hold elections, some of which have not been held since 2011.
There have been about 60 reported cases of iPod overheating, causing a total of six fires and minor burns in four people.
The Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) reported having information on 27 accidents related to these devices.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had notified it of 34 additional cases of overheating, which the company says is "not serious".
The ministry responded by calling Apple's delay in reporting "really regrettable".
The earthquake hit Mariana at 07:19 am local time (9:19 pm GMT on Friday).
The Northern Mariana Islands Emergency Management Office announced that there were no reports of damage in the country.
Also, the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said there were no tsunami indicators.
A former Philippine police officer held Hong Kong tourists hostage after hijacking their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 rifle at tourists.
Several hostages have been rescued so far, and at least six have been confirmed dead.
Six hostages were released earlier, including children, elderly people and photographers from the Philippines.
The photographers later took the place of the old lady when she needed a bathroom.
Following in his father's footsteps, Liggins began a career in medicine.
He trained as a midwife and in 1959 began work at the State Women's Hospital in Auckland.
While working at Liggins Hospital, he spent his spare time researching premature birth.
His research showed that the hormone injection would accelerate the maturation of the baby's lungs.
Xinhua reported that government investigators on Wednesday found two "black boxes" for recording data during the flight.
Fellow wrestlers also paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer has stated that Luna was the first queen of extremes, my first manager, Luna died on the night of her 2nd birthday, pretty unique, just like her, a strong woman.
Dustin Goldust Runnels commented, "Luna was as strange as I was... maybe even more... I love her and will miss her... I hope she's in a better place".
Of 1,400 people polled before the 2010 federal election, the number of those opposed to Australia becoming a republic has risen by 8 percent since 2008.
During the 2010 federal election campaign, the interim Prime Minister Julia Gillard claimed that she believed Australia should become a republic after the reign of Queen Elizabeth II.
This opinion is shared by 34 percent of those polled who wish Queen Elizabeth II to be the last monarch in Australia.
The poll revealed two kinds of extreme views: 29 percent of those polled believe that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, and 31 percent believe that Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist was due to swim the 100m and 200m freestyle and three Commonwealth Games events, but his condition has been called into question by the appeal.
He couldn't take the pain medication he needed because those medications were banned at the Games.
Curtis Cooper, professor of mathematics and computer science at the University of Central Missouri, on January 25 discovered the largest known prime number.
Several people had confirmed the discovery by early February using various hardware and software, which was announced on Tuesday.
Comets may have been the source of bringing water to the earth along with organic matter that forms proteins and supports life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form, especially how the Earth formed, because comets collided with the Earth long ago.
Cuomo, 53, became governor earlier this year and last month signed a bill legalizing same-sex marriage.
He called the rumors political chatter and nonsense.
There's speculation that he's running for president in 2016.
The FAA claims that the NextGen system would allow aircraft to fly shorter routes, saving millions of gallons of fuel annually while reducing carbon emissions.
It uses satellite-based technology instead of outdated ground-based radar technology, so that air traffic controllers can more accurately locate aircraft and give pilots more accurate information.
No additional transport will be involved and no overhead trains will stop at Wembley, and car parking and bus passenger parking are not available near the stadium.
Fear of lack of transportation increased the likelihood that the game would have to be played behind closed doors without a team fan.
A study published Thursday in the journal Science claims to be the formation of a new bird species in the Galapagos Islands of Ecuador.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden said that the new species evolved in just two generations, although it was believed that the process took much longer, due to breeding between the endemic Darwin's frog, Geospize fortes, and the migratory cactus frog, Geospize conirostris.
Gold can be made into many different shapes.
It can be pulled out into a thin wire that can be rolled and stuck in.
It can be made very thin, and attached to other metals, and it can be so thin that it was sometimes used to decorate hand-painted pictures in books called illuminated manuscripts.
This is called the pH of a chemical, and you can make an indicator using red cabbage juice.
The color of the cabbage juice changes depending on how acidic or alkaline the chemical is.
The pH level is indicated by the amount of hydrogen (H in pH) ions in the test chemical.
Hydrogen ions are protons from which electrons are removed (because hydrogen atoms consist of one proton and one electron).
Mix two dry powders, then make a ball of them with your clean wet hands.
The moisture on your hands will react with the outer layers, which will cause a strange sensation and create a kind of protection.
In the cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro, almost every house had a flush toilet connected to a sophisticated sewage system.
Remnants of a sewage system have been found in houses in the mining towns of Crete and Santorini in Greece.
In ancient Egypt, Persia and China, toilets were sometimes part of public baths where men and women shared a mixed society.
When you call someone miles away, you use satellite.
A satellite in space receives a call, and then reflects it back down, almost instantaneously.
Scientists in space use telescopes because the Earth's atmosphere distorts some of our light and view.
To put a satellite or a telescope in space, you need a giant rocket over 100 feet high.
The wheel changed the world in incredible ways. The most important thing the wheel has provided us is much easier and faster transportation.
He brought us a train, a car, and many other means of transportation.
Below them are medium-sized cats that eat medium-sized prey ranging in size from rabbits to antelopes to deer.
After all, there are many small cats (including stray pet cats) that eat much more numerous small prey such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret to their success is the concept of niche, a special skill that each cat possesses and that makes it uncompetitive.
Lions are the most sociable of cats and live in large groups called herds.
The herd consists of one to three adult males in a litter and as many as 30 females and cubs.
Women are usually closely related to each other because it's a big family of sisters and daughters.
Lion herds act similarly to wolf or dog herds, animals that are surprisingly similar in behavior to lions (but not to other big cats), and also very deadly in their prey.
Like a true multi-sport athlete, a tiger can climb (though not well), swim, jump great distances, and pull with five times the force of a strong man.
The tiger is in the same group as the lion, the leopard and the jaguar, and these are the only four cats that can roar.
The tiger's roar is not like the full-voiced roar of a lion, but more like a phrase of angrily shouted words.
The ocelots like to eat small animals, and if they can, they will catch monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds, and almost all the animals that the ocelot hunts are far smaller than it is.
Scientists think that the ocelots track and find prey animals by smell by sniffing the soil on which the animals have been.
They see very well in the dark because of their night vision, and they move very quietly, and they hunt by fitting in with their surroundings and then jumping on their prey.
When a small group of living things (a small population) separates from the main population from which they originate (for example during a crossing over a mountain range or river or if they cross to a new island, so they cannot easily return), they will often find themselves in an environment different from the one they were in before.
This new environment has different resources and different competitors, so the new population, to be a strong competitor, will need different characteristics or adaptations from what they needed before.
The original population hasn't changed at all, and they're still in need of adaptation as before.
Over time, as a new population adapts to its new environment, it begins to look less and less like the other population.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will be so different that they can't be called the same species.
This process we call speciation, which simply means the formation of new species.
Plants produce the oxygen that humans breathe, and they take in the carbon dioxide that humans exhale.
Plants produce food by photosynthesis using the sun. They also provide cooling.
We build our houses and make our clothes out of plants, and most of the food we eat is plants, and without plants, animals couldn't survive.
Mosasaurus was the greatest predator of his time, feared nothing but other mosasaurs.
Its long jaws contained more than 70 razor-sharp teeth, along with an additional row on the palate, meaning there was no escape for any creature that came in its way.
We don't know for sure, but she may have had a sharp tongue, and her diet included turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and she may even have been a cannibal.
It attacked anything that could enter the water, and even a giant dinosaur like the T. rex couldn't grow up to it.
While most of their food was familiar to us, the Romans also ate some strange or unusual foods at feasts, including wild boar, peacocks, snails and a type of rodent called the puff.
The other difference was that while poor men and women ate sitting down, rich men liked to have banquets together where they would lie on their hips while they ate.
Ancient Roman dishes could not have included food that came to Europe from the Americas or Asia in later centuries.
For example, they had no corn, no tomatoes, no potatoes, no cocoa, and no old Roman had ever tasted puré.
The Babylonians built a main temple to each deity, which was considered the home of that deity.
People would offer sacrifices to the gods, and priests would try to satisfy the gods' needs through ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open courtyard and an inner sanctuary that was open only to priests.
Sometimes special towers in the shape of pyramids, called ziggurats, were built to be part of temples.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary for the god.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, home wasn't that important.
Most of the life of a Hebrew family was spent outdoors.
Women cooked in the yard; the shops were just open cash registers facing the street.
The land of Canaan was not heavily forested, so timber was incredibly expensive.
Greenland was sparsely populated, and in the Norwegian sagas, they say that Erik the Red was banished from Iceland for murder, and when he traveled further west, he found Greenland and gave it that name.
However, regardless of its discovery, Eskimo tribes already lived there during this period.
Although each country was "Scandinavian", there were many differences between the peoples, kings, customs, and histories of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you've seen the movie National Treasure, you might think that on the back of the Declaration of Independence is a map to the treasure.
Although it says something on the back of the document, it's not a treasure map.
The back of the Declaration of Independence reads "The original Declaration of Independence of July 4, 1776".
Although no one knows for sure who wrote it, it is known that this large document on parchment (293⁄4 by 241⁄2 inches) was originally folded up and placed in an archive.
So it's possible that the note was added simply as a tag.
The Normandy landings and subsequent battles liberated northern France, but the south was still not free.
Northern France was ruled by the French Vichy, who in 1940 made peace with the Germans and cooperated with the occupiers instead of fighting them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies attacked southern France, and the attack was called Operation Dragoon.
In just two weeks, the Americans and the Free French had liberated southern France and turned their backs on Germany.
Civilization is one culture shared by a large group of people who live and work together, society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin word civilis, which means civic and is related to the Latin word civis, which means citizen and civitas, which means city or city-state and which in some way defines the size of society.
Civilized culture involves the transfer of knowledge across generations, a long-lasting cultural trail and equitable dissemination.
Smaller cultures often disappear without leaving behind any relevant historical evidence and without being recognized as true civilizations.
Under the Treaty of Confederation, during the War of Independence, the thirteen states first formed a weak central government, the only component of which was the Congress.
Congress lacked the power to impose taxes, and since there was no national executive or judiciary, it relied on state agencies to enforce the act, which often did not cooperate.
Nor did he have the authority to overturn tax laws and tariffs between states.
Members sought the full consent of all states before they could be amended, and states understood central government so readily that their representatives were often absent.
The Italy national football team, along with the German national football team, is the second most successful national team in the world and were the 2006 FIFA World Cup champions.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and F1 car racing.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern regions, and Italians compete in international competitions and Olympic events.
Japan is made up of nearly 7,000 islands (Honshu is the largest), making Japan the seventh-largest island in the world!
Because of the cluster/group of islands that Japan has, Japan is often referred to from a geographical perspective as the  Archipelago
Taiwan's origins date back to the 15th century when European sailors in transit recorded the island's name as Ilha Formosa, or Beautiful Island.
The Dutch East India Company established a base in 1624 in southwest Taiwan, initiated a change in Aboriginal grain-producing practices and employed Chinese workers to work on its rice and sugar plantations.
Qing Dynasty forces (1644-1912) took control of the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan in 1683 and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
After defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki in 1895 ceding sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
There are three main buildings in Machu Picchu - Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Three Window Room.
Most of the buildings on the edges of the complex have been restored to give tourists a better view of what they originally looked like.
Thirty percent of Machu Picchu was restored by 1976, and the restoration has continued to this day.
For example, the most common static image format in the world is 35 mm, which dominated at the end of the analog film era.
It's still being produced today, but more importantly, the image format is taken from the image sensor format of digital cameras.
The 35mm format is actually a bit confusing - 36mm wide by 24mm high.
Thus, the ratio of this format (divided by twelve to get the simplest ratio of the whole number) is said to be 3:2.
Many common formats (for example, the APS family of formats) are equal to or approximate to this ratio.
The rule of thirds, often abused and often ridiculed, is a simple guideline that creates dynamics while maintaining order in the picture.
It is stated that the most efficient place for the main subject is at the intersection of the lines that divide the image into thirds vertically and horizontally (see example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become rich and powerful, was in control.
For over a thousand years, Christianity has united the nations of Europe despite their different languages and customs.
Her dominant power has affected everyone from the king to the common man.
One of the main tenets of Christianity is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty and that the church's funds serve exactly that purpose.
The central body of the church has been in Rome for over a thousand years and because of this concentration of power and money many question whether this rule is being followed.
Soon after the conflict broke out, Britain began a naval blockade of Germany.
The strategy has proven effective in disrupting the delivery of vital military and civilian supplies, although this blockade violates internationally accepted law codified in several international treaties from the previous two centuries.
Britain mined international waters to prevent any ships from entering parts of the ocean, posing a danger even to ships of neutral countries.
Given the limited response to this tactic, Germany expected a similar response to its unlimited warfare under the sea.
During the 1920s, the attitudes that prevailed among most citizens and nations were pacifism and isolationism.
After seeing the horrors and crimes of war during World War I, nations wanted to avoid such a situation in the future.
Tesla moved to the United States in 1884 because he accepted a job at Edison in New York.
He arrived in the United States with 4 cents in his pocket, a book of poetry and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his manager at his previous job) for Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of representing different time periods.Each stage in Chinese history or each family that was in power was a distinct dynasty.
The period between each dynasty also represented a period of divided provinces, the most famous of which was the Three Kingdoms period, which lasted for 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During these periods, fierce wars were fought among many nobles who were vying for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest periods in ancient Chinese history, with thousands of people dying fighting for the highest place in the great palace of Xi'an.
There are many social and political effects, such as the use of the metric system, the shift from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism, and the belief that the state belongs to the people, not to the sole ruler.
Also, after the revolution, the occupations were opened to all male applicants, allowing the most ambitious and successful to succeed.
The same goes for the military, because instead of ranking military ranks by class, they're now ranked by caliber.
The French Revolution inspired many other oppressed working-class peoples in other countries to launch their own revolutions.
Muhammad was deeply interested in subjects beyond this earthly life, and he often spent time in the cave that became known as Hira on Mount Noor (light) and meditated.
The cave itself, which has survived all the time, gives a vivid picture of Muhammad's spiritual inclinations.
The cave, located on top of one of the mountains north of Mecca, is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, it's not easy to find even if someone knows it's there.
Nothing is visible except the clear, beautiful skies and numerous mountains, and very little of this world can be seen or heard from inside the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the seven wonders of the world still standing today.
The Great Pyramid, built by the Egyptians in the third century B.C.E., is one of many great pyramidal structures built in honor of the dead pharaoh.
The Giza plateau or Giza Necropolis in Egypt's Valley of the Dead is home to a number of pyramids (the Great Pyramid being the largest), several small tombs, temples, and a large Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built in honor of the Pharaoh Khufu, and many smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built in honor of Khufu's wives and family members.
The upward sign looks like a V, and the downward sign looks like a comma or a square with the bottom missing.
Up means you should start at the top and push the hammer, and down means you should start at the frog (where your hand holds the hammer) and pull the hammer.
A howl upwards usually produces a softer sound, while a howl downwards is louder and more declarative.
Feel free to write your own labels, but remember that the printed labels of the bowls are for the purpose of music, so they should be respected.
The frightened King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette and their two young children (11 year old Marie-Thérèse and 4 year old Louis-Charles) and the king's sister, Madame Elizabeth, were driven back to Paris from Versailles by a mob of women from the marketplace on October 6, 1789.
In a carriage, they returned to Paris surrounded by a mob of people who shouted and threatened the king and queen.
The crowd forced the king and queen to keep the windows of their carriages wide open.
At one point, a member of the mob waved the head of a member of the royal guard who was killed at Versailles in front of the terrified queen.
The war costs of American imperialism in conquering the Philippines were paid by the people of the Philippines.
They were forced to pay taxes to the colonial regime of the United States to cover a large part of the costs and interest on bonds that were issued on behalf of the Philippine government through Wall Street banks.
Of course, the super profits derived from the long-term exploitation of the Filipino people would represent a major gain for US imperialism.
In order to understand the Templars, it is necessary to understand the context that prompted the establishment of the Order.
The time period in which these events occurred is usually referred to as the medieval period of European history in the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (AD 10001300).
The developed Middle Ages were preceded by the Early Middle Ages, and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which by convention was decided to be completed around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that in practice encompasses a wide range of ideas, from the technological instinct or technological imperative to the strict sense that human destiny is guided by the underlying logic associated with the laws of science and their representation in technology.
Two general ideas are common to most interpretations of technological determinism: that the development of technology itself follows a path that is far beyond the influence of culture or politics, and that technology in turn has effects on societies that are inherent, not socially conditioned.
For example, one might say that the motor vehicle inevitably leads to the development of roads.
However, the road network across the country is not economically viable for just a few cars, so new production methods have been developed to reduce the cost of owning a car.
Mass car ownership also leads to more road accidents, leading to the invention of new medical techniques for repairing injured bodies.
Romanticism had a significant element of cultural determinism, borrowed from writers such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography shaped individuals and over time, customs and cultures associated with those geographical areas emerged and they, in harmony with the place of society, were better than arbitrarily imposed laws.
Just as Paris is known as the fashion capital of the modern world, Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its renowned epicenter of luxury began around 400 AD, and lasted until around 1100 AD.
Its status declined in the 12th century, largely due to the fact that the crusaders returned with gifts such as silk and spices, which were more prized than anything the Byzantine market offered.
At that time, the title of fashion capital shifted from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style reached its peak between the 10th and 11th centuries and the 14th century.
The style of dress was initially strongly influenced by Byzantine culture in the East.
However, because of slow communication channels, Western styles can be 25 to 30 years behind.
Western Europe towards the end of the Middle Ages began to develop its own style. One of the greatest developments of that time as a result of the Crusades was when people began to use buttons to fasten clothes.
Self-sustainable agriculture is agriculture that aims to produce sufficient food for the needs of the farmer and his family.
Self-sustaining agriculture is a simple, often organic system that uses preserved seeds from a particular eco-region in combination with a flower garden or other relatively simple techniques to increase yields.
Historically, most farmers were self-sufficient in agricultural production, which is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together people of the same worldview who feel they are being ignored by social standards and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures can be distinguished by age, ethnicity, class, location and/or gender of members.
The qualities that make a subculture different can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or a combination of these factors.
Members of subcultures often show their affiliation through specific and symbolic use of style, which includes fashion, behavior, and jargon.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to point out several unfortunate cases of children who were not allowed to socialize by their developmental adults because of neglect, accident or intentional abuse.
Some wild children were imprisoned (usually by their parents); in some cases the children were rejected because their parents rejected their serious intellectual or physical deficiencies.
Abandoned children may have experienced violence or trauma before they were abandoned or fled.
The rest are thought to have been raised by animals, some are thought to have lived independently in the wild.
After being raised entirely by nonhuman animals, the wild child displays behaviour (within physical limitations) that is entirely similar to the behaviour of the animal that cared for it, such as fear and indifference to humans.
While project-based learning is supposed to make learning easier and more interesting, the scaffolding method is a step ahead.
Scaffolding is not a learning method, but a means of aiding individuals who are going through a new learning experience, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Help can be both virtual and real, in other words, the teacher is one form of help but also the little man of the connector in Microsoft Office.
Virtual scales are embedded in software and are intended to examine, guide and explain procedures that may be challenging for the student to perform on their own.
Children enter the foster care system for a variety of reasons, ranging from neglect, to abuse, to even blackmail.
No child should ever grow up in an environment that doesn't express care, tenderness and education, but it does.
We believe the foster care system is a safe haven for these children.
Our housing system is supposed to provide a safe home, loving caregivers, stable education and reliable health care.
The foster care should meet all needs that were unmet in the home from which they were previously removed.
The Internet combines elements of both mass and interpersonal communication.
The different features of the Internet lead to additional dimensions in terms of access to benefits and satisfaction of needs.
For example, learning and socialization are considered important motives for using the Internet (James et al. 1995).
When investigating audience reactions to websites, Eighmey and McCord (1998) identified "personal engagement" and "continuous connection" as new aspects of motivation.
The use of video has led to important breakthroughs in interpreting micro-expressions, facial movements that last for several milliseconds.
Specifically, it is claimed that by correctly interpreting a microexpression, it can be detected whether a person is lying.
Oliver Sacks, in his paper, The Presidential Speech, suggested that people who cannot understand speech because of brain damage can still correctly judge honesty.
He even suggests that such abilities in interpreting human behavior might be possessed by animals like domestic dogs.
Research in the 20th century pointed to the fact that there are two types of genetic variation: hidden and expressed.
Mutation adds a new genetic variation, and selection is the removal from a group of expressed variations.
Segregation and recombination mix the variations between these two bases in each generation.
A primate with a digestive system like humans, in the savannah, can find it difficult to meet its amino acid needs from available plant resources.
Moreover, failure to do so leads to serious consequences: increased depression, malnutrition, and eventually death.
The easiest available plant resources would be the proteins available in leaves and fungi, but they're hard for primates like us to digest unless they're cooked.
In contrast, animal foods (ants, termites, eggs) are not only easy to digest but also provide a huge amount of proteins containing essential amino acids.
All things considered, we shouldn't be surprised if our ancestors solved the protein problem in a similar way to how chimpanzees do in the savannah today.
Interruption of sleep is the process of deliberately waking during a normal sleep period and falling back to sleep somewhat later (10-60 minutes).
This can easily be accomplished by using a relatively silent alarm clock that will bring you to consciousness without waking you up completely.
If you find yourself setting the alarm again in your sleep, you can leave it on the other side of the room so you have to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other biorhythm-based options involve taking a lot of fluids (especially water or tea, which is a known diuretic) before bed, which will make the person get up to wet.
The amount of inner peace a person possesses is the opposite of the amount of tension in a person's body and spirit.
The less tension, the more positive the life force present, each person has the potential to find their absolute peace and contentment.
The only thing that stands in the way of this goal is our own tensions and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but it is spread through the Mahayana way of love and the many techniques of Indian yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of kundalini yoga, meditation and the path of absolute love.
In kundalini yoga, the kundalini energy (enlightenment energy) is awakened through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras and visualization.
The center of Tibetan meditation is the deity Yoga, through the visualization of various deities, energy channels are cleansed, chakras are activated, and enlightened consciousness is created.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, which led to cooperation between the USSR and the United States.
Two years after the end of the war, the former allies had now become enemies and the Cold War had begun.
It would last for the next 40 years and would actually be led, through proxy armies, on the battlefields from Africa to Asia, to Afghanistan, to Cuba and many other places.
By September 17, 1939, the Polish defences were already broken and the only hope was to withdraw and reorganize along the Romanian bridge defences.
However, these plans were virtually obsolete overnight, when over 800,000 soldiers from the Soviet Red Army entered and established the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts after invading eastern parts of Poland, thereby violating the Riga Peace Accords, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact and other international agreements, both bilateral and multilateral.
Using ships to transport goods is by far the most efficient way to move large quantities of goods and large numbers of people across the ocean.
The Navy's job has traditionally been to ensure that the country maintains the ability to move its people and goods, while also impeding the enemy's ability to move its people and goods.
One of the most notable recent examples of this practice was the North Atlantic campaign of World War II, when the Americans tried to move troops and supplies across the Atlantic to help Britain.
At the same time, the German Navy was using U-boats to try to stop this trade.
If the Allies had failed, Germany would probably have been able to conquer Britain the way it conquered the rest of Europe.
It seems that goats were first domesticated almost 10,000 years ago in the Iranian mountains of Zagros.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to breed them for easy access to milk, hair, meat, and leather.
Domesticated goats were most often kept in herds that roamed the hills or other grazing areas, and were often kept by shepherds, mostly children or adolescents, who are similar to modern-day shepherds.
Wagons were produced in England as early as the 16th century.
Although the carriages consisted only of parallel wooden planks, they enabled the horses to pull them to achieve greater speeds and to pull more loads than was the case on the somewhat rougher roads of the time.
Railway sills were introduced early enough to fix the rails, but it was gradually realized that rails would be much more efficient if they had a metal strip on top.
This became common practice, but the iron caused more wear on the wooden wheels of the wagons.
The wooden wheels were eventually replaced by iron wheels, and the first railway with full iron was introduced in 1767.
The first known form of transport was walking, and people began walking upright two million years ago with the appearance of homo erectus.
Their ancestors, the Australopithecus, were not accustomed to walking upright.
Bipedal specialization has been observed in fossils of Australopithecus from 4.2-3.9 million years ago, although there is a possibility that Sahelanthropus walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can start living more environmentally friendly, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even become activists to reduce suffering in the future in some way.
This sounds like symptomatic treatment in many cases, but if we don't want a temporary solution, we should find the cause of the problem and remove it.
Clearly, the world has changed considerably because of mankind's scientific and technological advances, and the problems have been exacerbated by overpopulation and extravagant lifestyles.
After it was passed by Congress on July 4th, a handwritten draft signed by President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was sent to the nearby John Dunlap's printing press.
Between 150 and 200 specimens were made that night, known today as Dunlap broadsides.
The first public reading of the document was given by John Nixon on July 8th, in the courtyard of the Independence Hall.
A copy was sent to George Washington on July 6th, and he read it to his troops in New York on July 9th.
The 25 Dunlap posters known to exist are the oldest surviving copies of the document.
Many paleontologists believe that one group of dinosaurs survived and still exists today.
Many people don't think of them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and they can fly.
However, there are many things about birds that still resemble dinosaurs.
They have chandelier feet and claws, lay eggs and walk on their backs like T-Rex.
Almost all computers in use today are based on manipulating information that is encrypted in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can have only one of two possible values, i.e. 0 or 1, and these numbers are called binary digits or bits in computer jargon.
Internal intoxication may not be immediately apparent, and symptoms such as vomiting are common enough to make an immediate diagnosis.
The best indicator of poisoning is the presence of an open box of medicines or toxic household chemicals.
Check the label for specific first aid instructions for that particular poison.
The term bug is used by entomologists in a formal context for this group of insects.
The term comes from an ancient acquaintance with the rock-crawlers, insects that are highly adapted to parasitize humans.
Both killer and common rockets are grim, adapted to life in the nest or dwelling of their host.
There are about 400,000 confirmed cases of multiple sclerosis (MS) in the United States, making it the leading neurological disease of young adults and middle-aged people.
Multiple sclerosis is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which consists of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Research has shown that women are twice as likely to get MS as men.
A couple may decide that it is not in their best interests, or in the best interests of their child, to raise the baby.
These couples can decide to make a plan to adopt a baby.
In the process of adoption, the biological parents relinquish their parental rights so that the other couple can raise the child.
The main goal of science is to determine the way the world works by the scientific method.
However, it's not just experimentation, and an experiment is a test used to eliminate one or more possible hypotheses, but asking questions and making observations also lead to scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts, especially the Latin Bible.
Aristotle's views on all questions of science, including psychology, were accepted.
As knowledge of Greek declined, the West became cut off from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many rhythms observed in physiology and behavior often depend on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production through biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms, which are not just responses to external periodic stimuli, have been observed in a wide variety of living things, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that keep moving even in the absence of external stimuli.
The Hershey-Chase experiment is one of the leading hypotheses that DNA is genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages or viruses to implant their DNA into the bacteria.
They did two experiments where they labeled the DNA in phage with radioactive phosphorus or they labeled phage protein with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have different effects depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the particular part of the genetic material, and whether the affected cells are germ cells.
Only mutations in swollen cells can be passed on to children, and mutations elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism attracts people interested in visiting natural areas to enjoy the landscape, including plants and wildlife.
Examples of on-site activities include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, visiting parks and learning about the ecosystem.
An example is visiting, photographing, and learning about the orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people drive from their small towns in the suburbs to their jobs, passing by those who work in the place they just left.
In this dynamic transport shuttle, everyone is somehow connected and supported by a transportation system that's based on private cars.
Science now shows that this high-carbon economy has pushed the biosphere out of one of its stable states that has supported human evolution for the past two million years.
They're all involved in society and they use transportation systems.
In developed countries, you'll rarely hear similar complaints about water quality or bridges crumbling.
Why do transport systems cause such complaints, why do they fail on a daily basis? Are transport engineers simply incompetent? Or is something more fundamental going on?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and their interactions.
Unfortunately, studying traffic flow is difficult because driver behavior cannot be predicted with absolute certainty.
Fortunately, drivers generally behave quite consistently, so traffic has some sort of reasonable consistency and can be roughly represented mathematically.
In order to better represent traffic flows, links have been established between three basic characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density and (3) speed.
These relationships help with the planning, design and operation of road facilities.
Insects were the first animals to fly, and their ability to fly helped them to avoid enemies and to search for food and mates more efficiently.
The advantage of most insects is that they can fold their wings along the body.
This gives them a wider range of small places to hide from predators.
The only insects that can't flap their wings backwards today are the fairies and the water lilies.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system revolves around the sun.
Some thought he was right, but most believed the opposite - that the solar system, including the sun (and even other stars), revolves around the earth.
Sounds reasonable, because we don't feel the Earth moving, do we?
The Amazon River is the second longest and largest river on Earth, with more than eight times the water of the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, up to six miles wide in some places.
The full 20 percent of the water that flows from the river into the ocean comes from the Amazon.
The Amazon's main river is 6,387 kilometers (3,980 miles) long, and it collects water from a thousand smaller rivers.
Although the construction of stone pyramids continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the pyramids at Giza were never surpassed in terms of their size and technical perfection of construction.
The new kingdom of the ancient Egyptians admired the monuments of their ancestors, which were then over a thousand years old.
The Vatican has about 800 inhabitants, making it the smallest independent state in the world and the least populous.
Vatican City uses Italian for legislation and official communication.
Italian is also the everyday language spoken by most of the country's employees, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All Vatican residents are of the Roman Catholic faith.
People have known about the basic chemical elements of gold, silver and copper since ancient times because they can all be found in nature in their original form and can be relatively easily mined using primitive tools.
Aristotle, the philosopher, theorized that everything is made up of a mixture of one or more of the four elements: earth, water, air, and fire.
This was more like the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gaseous, and plasma, although he also had the theory that they change into new substances and build what we see.
Alloy is basically a mixture of two or more metals.
Elements like calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are metals like silver and gold.
You can also have alloys that contain small amounts of nonmetallic elements, like carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter, all matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly small that trillions of them could fit in the dot at the end of this sentence.
So, the pencil was a good friend to many after it was invented.
Unfortunately, with the development of newer writing styles, the pen has fallen into a lower status and is rarely used.
People now text on computers and never have to get a pencil sharpener.
We can only wonder what will become of the keyboard when something newer comes along.
The physics bomb works on the principle that energy is needed to make a nucleus with a mass of protons and neutrons.
It's like pushing heavy wagons up a hill, and then splitting the core again releases some of that energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means they tend to decay with little or no stimulation.
The surface of the moon is made up of rocks and dust.
The crust is about 70 kilometers thick on the near side and 100 kilometers on the far side.
It's thinner under the seas, and thicker under the mountains.
The near side may have more lava because the crust is thinner, so it was easier for the lava to rise to the surface.
Content theories are focused on finding what drives people to behave or attracts them.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that have been outgrown during maturation into adulthood.
These theories look at what makes some people want what they do and what will make them do or not do certain things in their environment.
The two popular theories of satisfaction are Maslow's theory of the hierarchy of needs and Herzberg's theory of two factors.
Generally speaking, there are two kinds of behavior that can occur when managers start managing their former peers.
This type of manager has difficulty making unpopular decisions, enforcing disciplinary measures, evaluating staff, assigning tasks, and demanding accountability from employees.
At the other end of the spectrum, one becomes an unrecognizable individual who feels that he or she must change everything the team has been doing and make it their own.
After all, the leader is the one who ultimately bears responsibility for both the success and failure of the team.
This behavior often results in a disagreement between the leader and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams adhere to the same standards of excellence as conventional teams, yet there are subtle differences.
Virtual team members often act as a point of contact for their physical groups.
They often have more autonomy than other team members because their teams can meet in different time zones, which their local leadership may not understand.
A unique component of a virtual team is the presence of a real "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p. 109).
The invisible team is a management team to which each member is responsible, and this team sets the standards for each member.
Why would an organization want to go through the time-consuming process of setting up an organization for learning? One goal for putting the concepts of organizational learning into practice is innovation.
When all available resources are used efficiently in the functional departments of an organization, creativity and genius can emerge.
As a result, the process of an organisation collaborating to overcome a barrier can lead to a new innovative process for meeting the needs of clients.
Before an organization can become innovative, leadership must establish a culture of innovation, as well as shared knowledge and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) explains the continuum approach as a method used to help organizations achieve higher performance levels.
Neurobiological data provides physical evidence for a theoretical approach to cognitive research, so they narrow the field of research and make it much more precise.
The link between brain pathology and behavior is supporting scientists in their research.
It has long been known that different types of brain damage, trauma, injury, and brain tumors affect behavior and cause changes in certain mental functions.
The advancement of new technologies allows us to observe and investigate brain structures and processes that have never been seen before.
This gives us a lot of information and material to build simulation models that help us understand the processes in our minds.
Although AI has a strong science fiction context, it is an extremely important branch of computer science that deals with behavior, learning, and intelligent machine adaptation.
Research in the field of artificial intelligence (AI) involves the development of machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include control, planning and sequencing, the ability to provide answers to diagnoses and client questions, as well as handwriting, voice and face recognition.
Such things have become separate disciplines that are focused on providing solutions to everyday problems.
AI systems are now commonly used in economics, medicine, engineering, and the military, and have been incorporated into several home computer and video game applications.
Excursions are an important part of every classroom, and often a teacher would like to take her students to places where bus travel is not an option.
Technology offers a solution in the form of virtual tours, where students can view artifacts in museums, visit aquariums, or admire beautiful art while sitting in class.
Virtual travel is also a great way to reflect on your journey and share experiences with future students.
For example, every year, students at Bennet School in North Carolina design a website about their trip to the state capital, and that website changes every year, but the old versions are kept on the Internet and serve as an album.
Blogs can also help improve students' writing skills.Although students often start their experience on the blog with sloppy grammar and spelling, audience presence usually changes that.
Since students are often the most critical audience, the blogger begins to strive to improve his writing to avoid criticism.
Also, blogging "communizes students to become more aware of the world around them". The need to build on the interests of the audience inspires students to be smart and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that inspires collaboration and encourages students to extend the learning process beyond the traditional school day.
By actively responding to materials found on the Internet, students can define their position in the context of what others are writing and can express their own opinion on certain issues (Oravec, 2002).
The city of Ottawa is Canada's charming, bilingual capital city, home to a host of art galleries and museums that showcase Canada's past and present.
To the south are Niagara Falls, and to the north lies the untapped natural beauty of Muskoka and other areas.
All of this and more highlights Ontario as what outsiders consider to be essentially Canadian.
Large areas further north are rather sparsely populated, and some represent almost uninhabited wilderness.
Here's a population comparison that surprises many: there are more African-Americans in the United States than there are Canadians.
The East African islands are in the Indian Ocean off the right coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest and represents a continent unto itself when it comes to wildlife.
Most of the smaller islands are independent states or are associated with France and are known as luxury beach resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam to those lands, which settled especially in the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonial conquest began in the 15th century, when Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered a sea route from Europe to India.
The area is bounded on the north by the Sahel, and on the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
Wives: it is recommended that all female passengers state that they are married, regardless of actual marital status.
It might help if you wear a ring, just not one that looks too expensive.
Women should understand that cultural differences can lead to something they might consider harassment and it's not uncommon for someone to follow them, hold their hand, etc.
Be firm in rejecting men and don't be afraid to stand your ground (regardless of cultural differences, it's not an office!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by a Berber fisherman in the 10th century B.C.E. and was used by the Phoenicians, Romans, and Merenids as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it as Casa Branca, only to abandon it after the earthquake of 1755.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city as Dar el-Baja, and the name Casablanca was given to it by Spanish traders who established trading bases there.
Casablanca is one of the most uninteresting places to shop in all of Morocco.
Around the old city of Medina, it's easy to find places that sell traditional Moroccan goods, such as weaves, pottery, leather goods, coconuts and a whole range of geomatics, but it's all made for tourists.
Goma is a tourist town in the Democratic Republic of Congo, in the far east of the country, near Rwanda.
In 2002, Gomu was devastated by lava from the Nyiragongo volcano, which flooded most of the city streets, especially in the center.
Although Goma is reasonably safe, all visits outside Goma should be investigated to understand the state of the ongoing fighting in North Kivu province.
This town is also the starting point for the Nyiragongo volcano with one of the cheapest mountain gorilla climbs in Africa.
You can use boda-boda (motorcycle taxis) to get around Goma.
Because of the fact that it is quite inaccessible, Timbuktu has come to be used as a metaphor for an exotic, distant land.
Today, Timbuktu is a poor city, although it has an airport and a reputation as a tourist attraction.
In 1990 it was added to the list of World Heritage Sites in Danger, due to the threat of desert sand.
It was one of the main stations during the PBS special Wonders of the African World hosted by Henry Louis Gates.
This city is completely different from other cities in the country because it has more Arabic than African style.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the northeast of South Africa and stretches along the border with Mozambique to the east and Zimbabwe to the north, with the southern border formed by the Crocodile River.
The park covers 19,500 square kilometers and is divided into 14 different ecozones, each of which supports a different wildlife.
It is one of South Africa's main attractions and is considered to be South Africa's premier national park (SANParks).
As with all South African national parks, there are daily protection and entrance fees.
It may be useful to buy a Wildlife Card to enter some parks in South Africa or all South African national parks.
Hong Kong Island gave the territory of Hong Kong its name and is a place that many tourists consider a major point of visit.
The parade of buildings that make up Hong Kong's outline is linked to the brilliant graph that is visible thanks to the presence of the waters of Victoria Harbour.
For the best view of Hong Kong, leave the island and head for Kowloon Harbour on the other side.
Most of the urban area of Hong Kong Island is densely settled on land along the northern coast.
This is the place that the British colonists took for themselves, so if you're looking for evidence of the colonial past of the territory, you can start here.
Sundarban is the largest coastal mangrove belt in the world, extending 80 km (50 mi) from the coast in the hinterland of Bangladesh and India.
The Sundarbans is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The part of the forest within the Indian territory is called Sundarbans National Park.
Yet, forests are not just salt marshes - they include some of the last remaining mighty jungles that once covered the Gangetic plain.
Sundarban covers an area of 3,850 km2, of which almost one third of the area is covered by water/wetlands.
The Sundarbans has been a wildlife sanctuary since 1966, and it is estimated that about 400 royal Bengal tigers and nearly 30,000 colorful deer now live in the area.
Buses depart from the bus station (across the river) throughout the day, although most, especially those going east and to Jakar/Bumthang, depart between 06:30 and 07:30 hours.
Since inter-city buses are often full, it is recommended to buy tickets several days in advance.
Most of the county is served by small Japanese buses that are comfortable and sturdy.
Shared taxi rides are a quick and easy way to travel to nearby places, such as Paro (No 150) and Punakha (No 200).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a suspension bridge that spans the Oyapock River, connecting the cities of Oiapoque, Brazil, and Saint-Georges de l'Oyjapock, French Guiana.
The two towers rise 83 meters high, are 378 meters long and have two stripes that are 3.50 meters wide.
The free-standing height of the bridge is 15 metres. Construction was completed in August 2011, but the bridge was not opened to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is expected to be fully operational in September 2017, when the Brazilian customs checkpoints are expected to be completed.
The Guarani were the most important indigenous community that lived in the area of what is now eastern Paraguay.
The Chaco region was home to other indigenous tribes, such as the Guaycurúa and Payaguá, who made a living by hunting, gathering fruit, and fishing.
Paraguay, formerly known as the "Divine Province of India", was founded in the 16th century after Spanish conquistadors met with indigenous indigenous groups.
The Spanish began a period of colonization that lasted three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to retain much of its original character and identity.
Argentina is well known for having some of the best teams and players in the world.
In December, the biggest tournament of the year is held at the polo courts of Las Cañitas.
Small tournaments and games can be seen here at any time of the year.
For news about tournaments and where you can buy tickets to polo matches, check out the Asociación Argentina de Polo.
The official currency of the Falklands is the Falklands pound (FKP), which is the equivalent of one British pound (GBP).
In the islands, money can be exchanged at the only bank located in Stanley, across the street from the FIC West trading post.
British pounds will be generally accepted anywhere on the islands, and credit cards and U.S. dollars are also often accepted in the town of Stanley.
Credit cards are unlikely to be accepted on remote islands, although British and United States currencies may be accepted; check with holders in advance as to what is an acceptable payment method.
It's almost impossible to exchange Falkland currency outside the island, so exchange the money before you leave.
Since Montevideo is located south of the equator, summer is there at the time when it is winter in the northern hemisphere and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in a subtropical climate; temperatures above +30 °C are common in the summer months.
Winters can be deceptively cold: temperatures rarely drop below freezing, but because of the combination of wind and humidity, it appears colder than the thermometer shows.
There are no distinct rainy and dry seasons: the amount of rainfall is approximately the same throughout the year.
Although many animals in the park are used to encounters with humans, wild animals are still wild and should not be fed or harassed.
Park officials are urging you to stay at least 100 yards per meter from bears and wolves and 25 yards per meter from all other wildlife!
Despite their seemingly docile appearance, buffalo, elk, mice, bears, and almost any large animal can attack.
Every year, dozens of visitors get hurt because they don't keep proper distance.
Also, remember that scents attract bears and other wildlife, so avoid wearing or cooking food products that smell and keep the camp clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa, located on the island of Upolu, and has a population of less than 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The port was the site of the infamous naval stalemate of 1889, when seven ships from Germany, the United States, and Britain refused to leave the port.
All but one British cruiser was sunk, and nearly 200 American and German lives were lost.
During the struggle for independence organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful rally in the city ended with the assassination of the Supreme Chief of Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
There are many beaches because Auckland is bordered by two harbours.
The beaches on the north shore (in the North Harbour district) are on the Pacific Ocean and stretch along Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Almost all are sandy beaches where it is safe to swim, and many are sheltered by pohutukawa trees.
Tamaki Drive Beaches are located in the Waitemata Harbour, in the suburb of Upper Mission Bay and St Heliers in Central Auckland.
These are sometimes crowded family beaches with a good range of shops that offer a beachfront.
The main local beer is Number 1, which is not a complex beer, but pleasant and refreshing.
There's a lot of French wines to drink, but New Zealand and Australian wines might be better for travel.
Local tap water is perfectly safe to drink, but if you're scared, you can easily find bottled water.
For Australians, the idea is straight white coffee side, short black is espresso, cappuccino is full of toppings (no foam), and tea is drunk without milk.
Hot chocolate meets Belgian standards, fruit juices are expensive, but they're excellent.
There are year-round trips to the reef, and reef injuries are rare.
However, listen to the advice of the authorities, respect all signs, and pay particular attention to safety warnings.
Cubomendes appear near the beach and estuary from October to April, north of the city.
There are sharks, but they rarely attack humans, and most sharks are afraid of humans and would swim away.
Sea crocodiles do not live permanently in the ocean, but their primary habitat is the estuaries north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance gives the passenger peace of mind, knowing that they will have accommodations once they reach their destination.
Travel agencies often have agreements with certain hotels, although you can see that through the agency it is possible to book other forms of accommodation, such as camping.
Travel agencies usually offer packages that include breakfast, airport transportation, or even a combination of flights and hotel accommodation.
They can hold your reservation if you want to consider the offer or extract other documents needed to travel to that destination (e.g. visa).
Any changes or requests should first be directed to the travel agent, not directly to the hotel.
When it comes to some festivals, the vast majority of music festival attendees choose to camp on the spot, and most attendees consider this an important part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the action, you'll have to get in early to take a camping spot close to the music.
Please note that while the music content on the main stages is complete, some parts of the festival may be played late into the night.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with young children.
If you're crossing the northern Baltic in winter, check the position of the cabin because crossing through the ice causes terrible noise for those most affected.
Cruise to St. Petersburg includes time spent in the city.
Casinos usually go to great lengths to maximize the time and money that guests spend, and there are usually no windows or clocks, and exits are hard to find.
They usually have special offers of food, drink and entertainment to keep the guests in good spirits and keep them in the facility.
However, drunkenness impairs judgment, and all seasoned gamblers know the importance of staying sober.
Anyone planning to drive at high altitude or over mountain passes should consider the possibility of snow, ice or low temperatures.
On icy and snowy roads, friction is low and it is not possible to drive like on clean asphalt.
During snowstorms, enough snow can fall very quickly to get you stuck.
Visibility can be limited by snow falling or blizzards or condensation or ice occurring on the windows of vehicles.
On the other hand, ice and snow are commonplace in many countries, and traffic continues to run largely undisturbed year-round.
Safari is perhaps the best tourist experience in Africa and the highlight for many visitors.
The term safari in popular usage refers to a journey overland to see the stunning African wildlife, especially in the savannah.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, often approach cars, and standard equipment will give you a good view.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards are sometimes shy, and you can see them better if you look through a binocular.
A safari walk (also known as a bushwalk, safari hike, or hiking) consists of hiking for several hours or several days.
The Paralympics will be held from August 24 to September 5, 2021, with some sporting events also taking place at other venues across Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to host two Summer Olympics, having already hosted in 1964.
If you've booked flights and accommodations for 2020 before the delay announcement, you may find yourself in an awkward situation.
Cancellation policies vary, but as of late March most coronavirus-caused cancellation policies do not extend until July 2020, when the Olympics are scheduled.
Most tickets are expected to cost between 2,500 and 130,000 yen, with the price of standard tickets being about 7,000 yen.
In many hotels, you can borrow a nail and a nail board, even if they are not in the room.
If a nail is not available or you don't like wearing folded socks, you can try using a fan, if available.
Be careful not to overheat the fabric (which may cause it to clot or, in extreme cases, to burn).
There are different ways to purify water, some more efficient depending on the specific threat.
In some areas, boiling water takes just one minute, while in others, it takes several minutes.
Filters vary in efficiency, and if you're concerned, consider buying bottled water from a reputable manufacturer.
Travelers may encounter animal pests they have not seen in their area.
Pests can spoil food, cause irritation or, at worst, an allergic reaction, spread poison or transmit infectious diseases.
Infectious diseases themselves, or dangerous animals that can violently injure or kill humans, are not usually classified as pests.
Shopping in tax-exempt stores is an opportunity to buy products that are tax-exempt and excise-free in certain locations.
Travelers to countries with high tax rates can sometimes save a considerable amount of money, especially on products such as alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The journey between Point Marion and Fairmont has the most challenging conditions for traveling on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Highway, as the road often passes through isolated forested areas.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, beware: the road is dominated by steep terrain, narrow lanes, and sharp curves.
The speed limits imposed are noticeably lower than on the previous and subsequent sections - usually 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h) - and strict adherence is even more important than usual.
Interestingly, cell phone reception here is much stronger than on many other sections of the route, such as the Pennsylvania Wilderness.
German pastries are quite good and in Bavaria they are quite rich and varied, similar to those made by their southern neighbours, the Austrians.
Fruit cakes are common - apples are baked in a dough year-round, and cherries and plums appear during the summer.
Many German pastries contain almonds, hazelnuts, and other nuts.
If you want a small but rich pastry, try a pastry that, depending on the region, is called Berliner, Pfannkuchen or Krapfen.
Curry is a dish based on herbs and spices, along with meat or vegetables.
Curry can be either dry or wet depending on the amount of liquid.
In the inland regions of northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is often used in curries. Coconut milk is often used in southern India and some other coastal regions of the subcontinent.
With a selection of 17,000 islands, Indonesian food is an umbrella term that encompasses a wide variety of regional gastronomy present throughout the nation.
But, when used without additional qualifiers, the term usually refers to food originating from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
The predominant flavors that Javanese love are peanuts, chili, sugar (especially coconut sugar) and various aromatic spices.
The crutches are the rider's footrests that hang from both sides of the saddle.
They provide greater stability to the rider, but can cause safety problems because the rider's feet can get stuck in them.
If a rider is thrown off the horse and his foot remains in the saddle, the horse may pull him back in case he starts to run.
First of all, most riders wear riding boots with a heel and a flat, fairly narrow sole.
Furthermore, some saddles, especially English saddles, have safety pads that allow leather straps to fall off the saddle if the rider pulls them in the fall.
In the Cochamó Valley, a top climbing destination in Chile known as the Yosemite of South America, there are various large granite walls and fissures.
The climbs include breathtaking views from the summit, climbers from all over the world constantly finding new routes through its endless potential walls.
Snow sports that involve downhill skiing and snowboarding are popular sports in which you descend a snow-covered terrain on skis or boards that are attached to your feet.
Skiing is the main travel activity of many enthusiasts, sometimes known as "ski-crazies", who plan their entire holidays in terms of skiing at a particular location.
The idea of skiing is very old - cave paintings depicting skiers date back to 5000 B.C.
Alpine skiing as a sport dates back to at least the 17th century, and the first recreational ski club was opened by Norwegians in Australia in 1861.
Ski backpacking: This activity is also called off-track skiing, ski-touring, or ski-hike.
It is related to alpine-style skiing or mountaineering, but usually does not include them, the latter being done on steep terrain and requiring a lot of hard skiing and boots.
Think of a ski run as a trail that's similar to a hiking trail.
Under good conditions, you will be able to cover greater distances than by walking, but you will rarely reach ski-running speeds without a heavy backpack and on paved trails.
Europe is a relatively small continent, but with many independent countries.Under standard circumstances, travelling through multiple countries would mean having to go through the visa and passport control process multiple times.
However, the Schengen area in this respect acts as one country.
As long as you're in this zone, you can cross the border without re-entering passport control.
Similarly, if you have a Schengen visa, you don't have to apply for a visa separately for each country in the Schengen system, saving you time, money and paperwork.
There is no universal definition of what is an antique, and some tax authorities define items over 100 years old as antiques.
The definition has geographical variations, where the age limit might be shorter in places like North America than in Europe.
Handmade products could be defined as antiques, even though they are newer than similar mass-produced goods.
