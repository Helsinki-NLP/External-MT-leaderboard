I'm worried about looking like a Welsh AM or a Muppets.
Some are skeptical of the proposal to change their title to MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
The plans to change the name of the Assembly to the Welsh Parliament have raised this suspicion.
There is a concern that the change will be triggered by the AM of various political parties.
One worker told AM that his group was concerned that the title "TWP and Pwp" would sound like it.
For readers outside Wales: Twp means fool in Welsh and pwp means scum.
One Played AM said the whole group was "outraged" and suggested alternatives.
A Welsh Conservative said his group was "open minded" about the name change, but he noted that MWP to MPET was a short verbal abuse.
In this context, the Welsh capital is pronounced the same as the Yorkshire English u.
The Assembly Commission, which is currently drafting legislation to initiate the name change, said: "The final decision on any description of what to name Assembly members will, of course, be made by the members themselves".
The Welsh Assembly is empowered to change its name by the Government of Wales Act 2017.
In June, the Commission published the findings of a public consultation on these proposals which showed broad support for naming the Assembly a Welsh Parliament.
In the case of the title of AM, the Commission showed no compatibility with the Welsh Parliament member or WMP, but, the MWP option received the most support in the public consultation issue.
The AMs are offering alternatives, but the struggle to reach the number of votes could be a headache for the incumbent, Elin Jones, who is expected to present a draft law on the changes in a few weeks.
The Act on Amendments will include other changes in the working methods of the Assembly, including the rules on the disqualification of AMs and the structure of the committee system.
When AMs discuss the law, they will take the final vote on what name they should address.
Macedonians will vote for a sovereignty on changing the country's name
Voters will vote on Sunday whether to change the name of their country to the Republic of North Macedonia.
The referendum is being held to resolve decades of conflict with neighbouring Greece, which has its own province called Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that its northern neighbor's name be represented on its territory and has consistently resisted efforts by EU and NATO members to give it.
The Macedonian President, George Ivanov, an opponent of the name change monarchy, has said that we will ignore this view.
But, including Prime Minister Zoran Zhaev, pro-democracy advocates claim that the name change is only the cost of joining the EU and NATO.
St. Martin's bells were silenced during the struggle at the Harlem church.
"Historically, the older people I spoke to said there was a bar and a chat room on every corner", Mr. Adams said.
"Today, none of this".
He said it is understandable that the bars disappeared.
"People come together in different ways" these days, he said.
"Bars are no longer the neighborhood living rooms where people go regularly".
In the context of the debate, they worry that the money from the sale of assets will not last as long as leaders expect, "and sooner or later they will return to where they started".
He added that apartments could be built in place of churches, and condominiums would be filled with people who do not support the neighbouring shelters.
"The majority of people who buy condominiums in these buildings will be white", he said, "and so it will soon be time to close this discussion completely because most people who come to live in these condominiums are unlikely to be members of this discussion".
Both churches were built by white groups before the city became a black city in 1870 - a decade after St. Martin's.
The group of white Methodists left in 1930.
A group of black people who were praying nearby took possession of the building.
A group of black people led by Rev. John Howard took over St. Martin, who had led the boycott of retailers on 125th Street, the main shopping street in Harlem, and opposed the hiring or promotion of black people.
The building was badly damaged in a fire in 1939, but Father Johnson's parishioners planned to rebuild it, and they started Carillon.
The Rev. David Johnson, son of Father Johnson and heir to St. Martin, proudly named the carillon "Poor People's Bell".
In July, the expert who played the carillon called it "a cultural treasure" and "an extraordinary historical instrument".
The expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also noted that this is the world's first carillon played by a black man, Dionysus A. Lind, who debuted in a larger carillon at Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriewether said that St. Martin did not replace him.
What happened in St. Martin's in the last few months is a complex story of architects and contractors, brought in in part by church leaders, and brought in the rest by the Episcopal Diocese.
The Westery  Board of Directors of the parish, composed of general leaders  They expressed concern when writing the diocese in July that the diocese would attempt to hand over the "cost matter" to the Westery, however the Westery was not involved in hiring the architects and contractors sent by the diocese.
Some parishioners complained that the diocese lacked transparency.
In California, a 13-year-old boy was injured by a shark on a lobster drive.
Officials said a 13-year-old boy was attacked and injured by a shark on Saturday while blowing his horn for the lobster on the first day of the lobster season.
The attack took place at 7 a.m. near the Beacons Bay in Encinitas.
Chad Hamall told KSWB-TV in San Diego that on Saturday morning, he was swimming with friends for about half an hour when he heard a boy screaming for help and he and a group of people went to him and helped him out of the water.
Hamley said that at first they thought it was a joke to catch a lobster, but then they realized, "He was screaming, he bit me!"
My bite is gone!'
His entire shoulder was broken", Hamline realized after saving the boy.
"I shouted to everyone to get out of the water: 'There's a shark in the water!'" Hamley said.
The boy was airlifted to Ready Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he was reported to be in critical condition.
The species of sharks responsible for the attack could not be understood.
Life-guard Captain Larry Giles told a news conference that the shark was spotted in the area a few weeks ago, but it was determined not to be a threatened species.
Giles said the injured boy suffered severe injuries to the upper body.
Officials have closed access to the beach from Panto Beach in Casablanca to Swamij in Assiniba for 48 hours for inspection and security reasons.
Giles notes that there are more than 135 species of sharks in the region, but most of them are not dangerous.
Sensesbury plans to enter the UK cosmetics market.
Sensbury is competing with Boots, Superdrugs and Debanhams by appointing department store-style Beauty Isles expert assistants.
As part of the UK's £2.8bn cosmetics market, which is continuing to grow as fashion and homewares sales decline, larger beauty eels will be tested in 11 stores across the country and, if successful, will be rolled out to more stores next year.
Cosmetic investments are coming as supermarkets are looking for ways to use the shelf space once used by TVs, microwaves and homeware.
Sensbury said it would double its cosmetics to 3,000, including brands like Revlon, Essie, Twizerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
The current range of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also have more space in branded parts found in shops like Boots.
The supermarket is also restarting its beauty makeup range to ensure that most products are vegetarian friendly.
In addition, fragrance retailer Fragrans Shop will offer discounts at two Sainsbury's stores, the first of which opened last week in Croydon, South London, while the second will open later this year, at Selby Oak, Birmingham.
The trend towards online shopping and small quantities of food purchases per day in local convenience stores means that supermarkets have to do a lot to attract people to them.
Sensesbury Chief Executive Mike Coop said that these retail outlets will increasingly look like department stores as supermarket chains struggle to cope with the increasing service and non-food demands of Aldi and Liddle discounters.
Sensbury has set up Argos outlets in hundreds of stores and has also launched several Habitatts since they bought both chains two years ago, which they believe have been successful in boosting grocery sales.
The previous attempt of this supermarket to reshape its beauty and pharmacy departments had failed.
Sensbury tried out a joint venture with Boots in 2000, but the partnership was formed after a dispute over how to split revenue from its chemist stores in supermarkets.
This new policy came into being after Sensbury sold its 281-store pharmacy business to Celiac, the owner of Lloyds Pharmacy Chain, for £125m three years ago.
He said that Lloyds will play a role in the scheme by including a wide range of luxury skincare brands including La Roche-Pose and Vichy in the four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sales Director, Sensbury, says: "We have changed the look of our beauty products to enhance the environment for our customers.
We have also invested in specially trained associates who will be ready to advise.
Our brands are tailored to each need and with attractive environments and convenient locations, we are attractive beauty spots that challenge the old shopping style".
Peter Jones 'shocked' after Holly Willowby withdrew from the £11 million deal.
Peter Jones, the Dragon's Den star, 'blasted' after TV presenter Holly Willowby cancelled his £11 million deal with his lifestyle brand business to focus on his new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willow has no time for his homewares and accessories brand Truly.
The business is compared to the Guinean brand of Paltrot.
This morning presenter, 37, said on Instagram that he was leaving.
Holly Willowby has pulled out of her lucrative lifestyle brand business at the last minute to anger Dragons Den star Peter Jones and is focusing on her new grand contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources said Jones was "shocked" when the popular TV star admitted at a stressful meeting at her business empire headquarters in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, on Tuesday that her new deals - worth £1.5 million - meant she no longer had enough time to focus on her homeware and accessories brand Truly.
The business is being compared to Guayne's Paltrot's private label and is estimated to double Biloby's fortune to £11 million.
As soon as Willow, 37, announced on Instagram that he was leaving Truly, Jones took a jet out of the UK and headed to one of his holiday homes.
A source said: "Truly, Holi was still at the top of the list of priorities.
This would be her long-term future, which would have made her successful in the next decade or two.
Everyone involved was amazed at her decision to leave.
No one could believe what was happening on Tuesday, so close to the opening.
There's a warehouse full of goods at Marlowe's headquarters that's ready to sell".
Experts say that one of Britain's most trusted stars, the emergence of a "bad morning", a massive investment in products ranging from cushions to candles and clothing to homeware, will cost the firm millions, and could delay its start-up even further.
And this could also be the end of a long-term friendship.
Willow, a mother of three, and her husband, Dan Baldwin, have been very close to Jones and his wife, Tara Cap, for the past ten years.
He co-founded Truly in 2016 with Willowby Cap and Jones and joined the 52-year-old Jones as president in March.
The couple spend their holidays together, and Jones owns 40 percent of Baldwin's TV production company.
Willow will become a brand ambassador for M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin as host of ITV's I'm a Celebrity.
A source close to Jones said last night, "We will not comment on these business developments".
There was a lot of chatter, and then we fell in love.
Some people say that he was a disgrace to the president and a laughingstock to the media's comments about the North Korean president being so positive.
Why has President Trump given up so much?
Trump said in his fake "news anchor" style.
"I have not given up anything".
He noted that Kim is keen for a second meeting after Trump praised the initial meeting in Singapore in June as a major step towards North Korea's disarmament.
But disarmament negotiations have stalled.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korean Supreme Diplomat Re Yong told the UN world leaders at the General Assembly on Saturday that North Korean moves to disarm early did not appear to receive a "corresponding response" from the United States.
Instead, he noted that the United States is continuing to impose sanctions to maintain pressure.
Trump expressed a more optimistic attitude in his address.
"Our relations with North Korea are going very well", he said.
"We were going to war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have been killed.
We have built this magnificent relationship".
Our efforts to improve relations with Kim have been met with positive results. Rocket tests have been halted, assistance is being provided to resolve the situation, and the remaining US personnel are returning home.
And he supported his unusual approach to talking about his relationship with Kim.
"It's very easy to be president, but it's better to have about 200 people here than trying to get 10,000 people into this crowded space", Trump said, pointing a finger at the crowd in front of him.
Indonesia was devastated by a tsunami and earthquake that killed hundreds of people.
After the Lompoc earthquake, for example, foreign NGOs were told they didn't need them.
Although more than 10 percent of Lompoc's population has been relocated, no national disaster has been declared, which is a prelude to international aid.
"In many cases, unfortunately, we are not asking for international assistance, so this is a bit of a challenge", Ms. Sumbang said.
While Save the Children is building a team to go to the Palau, it is still unclear whether foreign workers will be able to work on the ground.
The spokesperson of the National Disaster Agency, Shri Sutopo, said that Indonesian authorities are studying the situation in Palau to see if foreign organisations can be allowed to contribute to relief efforts.
With the continuous earthquakes in Indonesia, the country is very unprepared for the impact of nature.
Although tsunami nets have been built in the area, they are not easily found on other beaches.
Although a warning was given earlier, it is likely that the casualties were caused by the absence of a tsunami warning siren in Palo.
In good times, it is challenging to travel between many of Indonesia's islands.
Natural disasters make relief work more complex.
A hospital ship set up in Lompoc to treat earthquake victims is heading towards Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the new crisis site.
President Joko Widodo has put the issue of improving Indonesia's decaying infrastructure at the center of his election campaign, and he has spent a lot of money on roads and railways.
However, the lack of financial supplies is plaguing the administration of Mr. Joko, which is why he is facing the challenge of re-election next year.
Mr. Joko also faces the pressure of long-standing racial tensions in Indonesia, in which the Muslim majority of members have chosen a more narrow faith path.
Christian and Muslim gangs used razors, arrows and bows, and other village-based weapons, killing more than 1,000 people and displacing thousands of people.
See: Liverpool's Daniel Stirriss has tied the match against Chelsea
Daniel Stirridge saved Liverpool from a Premier League defeat by Chelsea in the 89th minute at Stamford Bridge in London on Saturday.
Stirridge's team was 1-0 behind Chelsea, and he got a pass from Sherdan Shakiri, about 30 yards from Chelsea's goal.
He tapped the ball on his left side and then took a shot at the far post.
His attempt went up the box and fell into the top right corner of the net.
Finally, the ball-bearer, Kepa, passed through Arizabalaga and fell into the net.
"He was just trying to get into that position, get on the ball and get players like Shaq always playing forward as much as possible, so I tried to make as much time for myself as possible", Stirling told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kent coming and touched it once and didn't think much about it and just shot it".
Chelsea were 1-0 ahead until mid-final after scoring a point in the 25th minute from Belgian star Eden Hazard.
The Blues striker then sent a pass back to Matteo Kovacic, then took a swing near the midfield and ran into Liverpool's half.
Kovacic made an immediate give-and-go on the midfield.
Then he hit a nice shot, so Hazard went into the box.
Hazard crossed the defensive line and saw Liverpool's Allison Baker, who threw a shot with his left foot into the distance post, ending his game.
Liverpool will play in the Champions League group stage at 3pm on Wednesday at the Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will play against Vidyutone in the UEFA Europa League on Thursday afternoon at 3pm in London.
The death toll from the Indonesian tsunami has risen to 832.
The death toll from the Indonesian earthquake and tsunami has risen to 832, the country's disaster management agency said on Sunday morning.
The 7.5 magnitude earthquake on Friday reportedly caused a large number of people to be crushed by the buildings and the earthquake caused waves of 20 feet high, said the Institute's spokesperson, Sutopo Purvo Nugroho, at a news conference.
The city of Pallu, which has more than 380,000 inhabitants, has now been hit by the collapse of buildings.
Police have arrested a 32-year-old man on suspicion of murder after a woman died from a gunshot wound.
A murder investigation has been launched after a woman's body was found in Burknhed, Merseyside this morning.
A 32-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of murder after a 44-year-old woman was found dead at 7.55am on Grayson Mews on John Street with head injuries.
Police have urged people in the area to come forward if they have seen or heard anything.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: "This investigation is in its early stages, but I urge anyone in the John Street area in Burknham to contact us if they have seen or heard anything suspicious.
I would urge anyone, especially taxi drivers, who may have misused anything on the dashboard footer to contact us because they may have the information necessary for our investigation".
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman killed was a resident of Burkenhead and her body was found inside a building.
Friends who claimed to know the woman came to the scene this afternoon and asked questions about where she was found this morning.
The investigation is ongoing and we are informing the relatives of the deceased.
A taxi driver from Grayson Mewes tried to enter his apartment, but the police told him that no one was allowed to enter or leave the building.
When he realized what had happened, he was silent.
Residents were told that they would be allowed back into the building in several hours.
Now, one police officer was heard telling someone that the entire area has been designated a crime scene.
A woman came to the scene, she was crying.
She kept saying, 'This is very bad.'
At 2 p.m., two police vans were inside the siege and another van was outside.
Many officers were standing inside the siege to monitor the blocks of flats.
If anyone has any information, they should give it to DM @MerPolCC or call 101 or contact CrimeStoppers by referring to Log 247 dated 30 September at 0800 555 111 anonymous.
The statue of Cromwell in Parliament is the latest monument to the controversial rewrite of history.
If he were to be removed, it would be like a poetic judgment given because his ardent purist followers have led the Taliban-like destruction of many of England's cultural and religious artifacts.
But the Cromwell Society has called Mr. Crick's suggestion "stupid" and "an attempt to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: "It was not foreseen that the image of Oliver Cromwell outside the Palace of Westminster would be the victim of the ongoing debate over the removal of the pups.
This glory of the English Civil War was not something that Cromwell had ordered or brought about.
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell would be sacrificed for the actions of his ancestor Thomas in the previous century.
The magnificent description of Cromwell by Sir William Thorncroft is evidence of 19th century belief and part of the historical graph of this personality, which many still believe to be venerable.
Mr Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Many, perhaps more than today, believe that in the late 19th century, Cromwell was a supporter of parliament than of external pressure, of course of monarchy in his case.
Whether this description is entirely accurate has been the subject of ongoing historical debate.
One thing is certain, the mid-17th century conflict has shaped the later development of our country, and Cromwell is a personally identifiable figure who represents one side of that divide.
His achievements as Lord Protector are also celebrated and memorable".
The Mustang pig killed a Chinese farmer.
Local media reported that a farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a market in southwestern China.
The man, who was reportedly given the surname "Yuan", was found dead in a blood vessel fractured at the Liopanshui market in Gishu province, South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
A farmer was preparing to vaccinate pigs in a hogger on May 30, 2005 in Shaining, Qinghai Province, China.
It was said that he came with his cousin from the nearby Yunnan province to sell 15 pigs at the market.
The next morning, his cousin was found dead, and he saw the door of the nearby pig cage open.
He said that there was a large male pig in the cage with blood in its mouth.
The forensic investigation confirmed that the 550-pound duck had deliberately killed the farmer, the report said.
"My cousin's legs were bloody and confused", said another brother, who was nicknamed "Wu", as quoted by Guyang Evening News.
According to security camera footage, Yuan entered the market at 4.40 am on Thursday to feed his pigs.
About an hour later, his body was found.
The pig that killed him didn't belong to Yuan or his cousin.
A market manager told Evening News that the pig was locked up to prevent anyone from attacking, and police are gathering evidence from the scene.
Yuan's family and market officials are reportedly negotiating compensation for his death.
Although this is a rare occurrence, there have been reports of pig attacks on humans.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband in Massachusetts, seriously injuring the man.
Ten years ago, a pig weighing 650 pounds struck a Welsh farmer on his tractor, and his wife finally kicked the pig out.
After a farmer in Oregon was eaten by his pigs in 2012, a farmer in Manitoba told CBC News that pigs are not usually aggressive but that the taste of blood can "catch" them.
"They're just playing games.
They're very hardworking, very searching... they're not meant to hurt you.
You just have to respect them as much as they deserve".
The impact of Hurricane Rosa will cause heavy rainfall across the southwestern United States.
It is estimated that as the storm Rosa moves into colder waters off the northern coast of Mexico, its intensity is decreasing.
But Rosa will rain heavily in the coming days in northern Mexico and the southwestern United States.
At 5am Eastern Time on Sunday, Rosa's winds were up to 85 mph, which is a Category 1 hurricane and it is located 385 kilometers southwest of Punta Eugenia.
Ross is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a bubble is beginning to form in the Pacific Ocean and is moving eastward along the U.S. West Coast. As a tropical storm, Rosa Baja, moves toward the California peninsula on Monday, it will begin to push the deepest temperate humidity northward in Southwestern America.
On Monday, Rosa will bring 10 inches of rain to parts of Mexico.
Later, the coming thunderstorms will combine with the temperate humidity to produce a large amount of heavy rainfall in the southwest in the coming days.
Local 1 to 4 inch rainfall is likely to cause dangerous flooding, debris spilling and possibly desert landslides.
Due to the deep temperate humidity, rainfall will remain 2 to 3 inches per hour in some places, especially in southern Nevada and parts of Arizona.
In the southwest, in particular, most of Arizona is expected to receive 2 to 4 inches of rainfall.
The disturbance of the temperate rainfall can cause sudden flooding with rapidly deteriorating conditions.
It is very dangerous to go out in the desert on foot when there is a risk of tropical rain.
Heavy rain can make canyons a muddy river and produce strong winds and dust at a local level.
The coming blizzard will cause heavy rainfall along the coast of Southern California.
More than half an inch of rain is possible, so there may be a slight amount of debris and roads will become slippery.
This may be the first rainfall of the rainy season in the region.
Some heavy rainfall will arrive in Arizona late on Sunday and early Monday, followed by heavy rainfall late on Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rainfall will spread to four corners on Tuesday and will continue till Wednesday.
As the Arctic gets colder, there may be some extreme temperature fluctuations in October, but the temperate zone will remain quite warm.
Sometimes this leads to dramatic changes in temperature in a short space of time.
Sunday is a great example of the dramatic change in temperature in Central America.
There is a temperature difference of about 20 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
In the next few days, the summer's swirling heat will rise and expand again.
In many parts of the central and eastern United States, a warm start is expected in early October with a wide 80 degrees from the southern plateaus to the northeastern.
New York City's temperatures could rise to 80 degrees on Tuesday, which is about 10 degrees above the normal average.
Our long-term weather forecast predicts that the East will be more likely to experience above average temperatures in the first half of October.
Over 20 million people watched Brett Cavanaugh's hearing.
The emotional testimony of Supreme Court-appointed Brad Keveno and the woman, Christine Blaise Ford, who was allegedly accused of sexual assault in the 1980s, was watched by more than 20 million people on six television networks on Thursday.
Meanwhile, while political tensions persisted, broadcasters broke the regular schedule on Friday by sidelining the final minute: An agreement brokered by Arizona Sen: FBI's Jeff Flake will run the charges for a week.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that he was 100 percent sure that Kevenough caught you drunk at a high school party and tried to undress you.
In a highly emotional testimony, Keveno said that we are 100 percent certain that this did not happen.
On Friday, more than 20.4 million people were expected to witness the testimony, Nelson said.
The company is counting average viewership on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
Other networks that showed the event, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network, were not immediately available.
And Nelson usually has some trouble counting the number of people who watch in offices.
In this respect, it is the same number of spectators for a playoff football match or an Academy Award.
The Fox News Channel, which was a strong supporter of Keveno's appointment, led all networks with an average of 5.69 million viewers during the entire day's hearing, Nelson said.
ABC remained in second place with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million viewers, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million and CNN 2.52 million, Nelson said.
After the hearing, the curiosity reached its peak.
Flack remained the focus of the Friday drama.
After the midstream Republican office issued a statement saying he would vote for Keveno, he was intercepted by CNN and CBS cameras as protesters announced against him on Friday morning as he headed to Geneva to attend a judicial committee hearing.
They stood up for several minutes, their eyes closed, and they were broadcast live on CNN.
"I'm standing right here in front of you", said one woman.
"Do you think they're telling the truth to the country?
They were told, "You have power when all these women are powerless".
Flake said that his office had issued a statement and before the elevator was shut down, he said that we would like to say more during the committee hearing.
When the Judiciary Committee was to vote to send Kevenough's nomination to the full Senate for a vote, the cable and broadcast networks did all the broadcasting hours later.
But Flake said we would only do so on the understanding that the FBI will investigate charges against the appointed minority Democrats that they are urging next week.
His conversation with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons, convinced Flake in part.
After a later conversation with Coons and several senators, Flake made his decision.
Flake's election was powerful, because it was clear that Republicans would not have the vote to approve Kevenno without a vote.
President Trump has launched an FBI investigation into charges against Kevneno.
British Prime Minister May accuses Brexit critics of 'politics'
Prime Minister Theresa May, in an interview with the Sunday Times, accused critics of "politicising" the future of Britain and underestimating national interest over their plan to leave the European Union.
Prime Minister Theresa May has arrived for the Labour Party Summit in Birmingham, UK on 20th September 2018.
In another of his interviews on the front page of the newspaper, his former Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson further attacked his alleged checkered plan for Brexit, calling the proposal "absolutely unreliable" for the UK and EU to collect each other's taxes.
WEDY SIMS shooting: Police arrested DiTion Simpson suspected of killing an LSU player
Police have arrested a suspect in the shooting death of 20-year-old basketball player, Weddie Sims, at LSU.
The Baton Rouge Police Department said 20-year-old DiToon Simpson was arrested and jailed on charges of second-degree murder.
Officials released a video of the fight between Sims and Simpson, and police said Sims' glasses were missing in the fight.
Police recovered the glasses from the scene and said they had found Samson's DNA, CBS affiliate WAFB reported.
After questioning Simpson, police said he confessed to shooting Maddy to death.
His attorney said his bond was set at $350,000.
The East Baton Rouge Parish Coroner's Office issued a preliminary report Friday saying the death was caused by a gunshot wound to the head.
The department has credited the Louisiana State Police Fugitive Task Force, The State Police Crime Lab, Southern University Police and the community with assisting in the investigation.
LSU Athletic Director Joe Aleva thanked the regional law enforcement agencies for their "dedication to the pursuit of justice and integrity".
Sims was 20 years old.
The 6-foot-6 forward grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for LSU.
He averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds last season.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said that the team was "disappeared" and "shocked" by Maddy's death.
"It's the same thing that keeps me worried", said Wade.
The volcano rained ash over Mexico City.
Ash from the Pocketpetal volcano has reached the southern outskirts of Mexico's capital.
The National Center for Disaster Prevention warned Mexicans to stay away from the volcanic eruption after it began to move rapidly, and 183 lots of gas and debris were released from it in 24 hours.
The Centre was monitoring vibrations and vibrations.
Social media featured pictures of car windows with a layer of rack in nearby cities like Shochimilco, Mexico City.
Geophysicists have seen an increase in activity in the volcanic zone, which is 45 miles (72 kilometers) southeast of the capital, after a magnitude 7.1 earthquake hit central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, called "Don Goyo", has been active since 1994.
A clash between the police and Catalan separatists erupted just before Independence Day.
Six people were arrested in Barcelona after pro-independence protesters clashed with gang police, and thousands joined the protests on the first anniversary of Catalonia's polarization vote over segregation.
When the gang stopped a group of masked separatist supporters, they threw eggs and colored spatter, causing dust clouds to accumulate on the roads crowded by ARVERV tourists.
When the blasts broke later in the day, the police used a baton to bring her into the barracks.
For hours, when pro-independence groups were cheating on "No Forget, No Forgive" the unionists were proclaiming "May Spain be angry".
According to local media, 14 people who were slightly injured in the encounter were treated.
The region of independent thought, which Madrid considered illegal but was celebrated by the separatist Catalans, was under pressure for a year after the October 1 referendum.
Voters cast a large number of ballots to become independent, but the number of voters declined as those opposed to the split boycotted the vote.
According to the Catalan administration, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after police tried to block polling stations during violent clashes across the region.
The pro-independence group sat down overnight on Friday to avoid a demonstration in support of the National Police.
The demonstration continued but he was forced to take a different path.
Narcisse Termis, 68, an electrician who joined his wife in the partisan protests, said he was no longer hopeful about Catalonia's chances of independence.
"Last year we had a very good life.
I saw tears of joy in my parents' eyes when I voted, but we are stuck".
Despite a brief but significant victory in the regional elections last December, Catalan independence parties have struggled to maintain their momentum this year and many of their popular leaders have either taken a leave of absence or are sitting in waiting for a trial for their role in holding the referendum and subsequent declaration of independence.
John Pig, a 42-year-old mechanic, expressed his opinion over the phone about the protests in support of the police, saying that the struggle was supported by politicians on both sides.
"This conflict is becoming more and more stressful", he said.
On Saturday, Oriol Jankeras, one of nine Catalan leaders who have been in pre-trial detention since the end of last year, announced that he would contest the European Parliament elections next year.
"The best way to stand as a candidate for the European elections is to condemn the decline in democratic values and our smile on the face of the Spanish government", he said.
London: Men arrested after cars broke into houses
Three men aged 33, 34 and 39 were arrested for frequent breaking into a house in London.
The incident occurred at around 19:30 BST on Thursday in Ballinagrad Crescent.
Department Inspector Bob Blemingz said the entrance and building were also damaged.
At one point, it is likely that a crossbow was thrown at the car.
The MEGA attack won Livingston 1-0 over the Rangers.
The first goal of Dolly Menga for Livingston was a decisive victory.
Livingston, who was promoted to manager of the Ibrox club, surprised the Rangers by giving Steven Gerrard his second 18-game defeat.
The Dolly Menga attack made the team go wild, and Gary Holt's team tied the game with Hibernian in the second round.
Gerard's team missed out on a win in the premiership this season and will be facing the Hearts, who are eight points behind, next Sunday.
Earlier, Rangers will be facing Rapid Vienna in the Europa League on Thursday.
Meanwhile, Livingston will continue their unbeaten six-game run in the division, their coach Holt has not seen a loss since taking the form from Kenny Myler last month.
Livingston offered a chance against the Boathouse visitors.
Holt's team should have taken the lead long before the score, because their precise shot had put the Rangers in complete danger.
Scott Robinson cut the circle but he crawled in front of the goal, then after Allen Lithgow moved Craig Halcott to the header goal, he was only able to expand his efforts.
The host team knew they could be a problem for the host team, so they were happy to let the Rangers play in front of them.
And in this way, it became a critical goal.
The Rangers gave a free kick and Livingston got a free kick. The Deccan Garaghar and Robinson paired up with Menga, who grabbed the ball and scored a goal from the middle of the box.
By then, the Rangers had retained their dominance, but the defensive line of the opposing team was unstoppable and goalkeeper Liam Kelly was not much of a threat.
The same pattern would remain in the second half, however Alfredo Morelos had to defend himself from Kelly.
Rangers goalkeeper Alan McGregor had Scott Pittman's feet on the ground, and Lithgow sent the ball further away from Livingston.
Crosses continued to come into Livingston's box and were continually removed, while two penalty suits were replaced by a move to challenge player Glenn Middleton, and one for handball.
The Bible says that "the world is full of falsehood".
BBC Scotland's Alasdair Lemont at the Tony McCrory Arena
A great game and a great result for Livingston.
For men, he played very well, he exceeded expectations in this direction of progress.
His style of play and player has rarely changed since returning from the top, but after Holt's arrival he should be credited with shaping the team.
He had many heroes.
Captain Halckett played hard, led a well-designed defensive line, while Menga kept up with Conor Goldson and Joe Voral.
However, the Rangers' motivation was diminished.
They were just as much under Gerard's leadership, they fell short of their standard play.
His last game was short, he only played once against the local team, and he was a warning sign for the Rangers in the middle of the table.
Erdogan was received in Cologne with a mixed reception.
When the leaders of Turkey and Germany met for lunch in Berlin, there was a lively atmosphere on Saturday.
This is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, with the aim of improving relations between NATO allies.
Their disagreements remained on issues including human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Later, Erdogan went to Cologne to inaugurate a grand new mosque.
The city has the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
Police gave security reasons to prevent 25,000 people from crowding in front of the mosque, but many supporters had gathered nearby to see their president.
Hundreds of protesters, many of them Kurds, also voiced their voices, denouncing Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to welcome their country.
The dividing image of these guests, who were considered heroes by some German Turks and were denounced as dictators by others, was reflected in these double demonstrations.
Deptford road accident: A cyclist killed in a car crash
A cyclist was killed in a car crash in London.
The accident occurred at approximately 10:15 BST, near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Avellan Street, a busy street in Deptford, southeast of the city.
The driver of the car stopped and paramedics helped, but the cyclist died on the spot.
This is the second accident in the country, about a mile from Saturday's crash, after a cyclist was killed in a crash on Children's Street a few months ago.
Metropolitan Police said the authorities are working to identify the deceased and inform his immediate family.
Roads have been closed and bus routes have been changed and drivers have been advised to avoid those parts.
Long Lartin Prison: Six officers injured in riots
Six prison officials were injured in a riot in a highly secure male prison, the prison office said.
The riots began at 09:30 BST on Sunday at HMP Long Martin and continue.
The expert "Torneado" officials have been called in to deal with the riots, eight prisoners are involved in the riots and it is limited to one wing.
The officers suffered minor facial injuries and were treated.
A prison service spokesperson said: "Special trained prison staff have been deployed to deal with the incident at HMP Long Lartin.
Six staff were treated for their injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons, and those responsible will be sent to the police and have to stay in jail longer".
HMP Long Lartine has over 500 inmates, including some of the most dangerous defendants in the country.
The prison governor was told to be hospitalized after a prisoner attacked him in June.
And last October, riot officials were called in to deal with the serious riots that were carried out by pulling bullets on employees.
Hurricane Rosa is threatening to cause flash flooding in Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City (likely to benefit disaster areas)
Tropical low pressure is rare to hit Arizona, but as Hurricane Rosa moves southwestward with its remaining strength in the desert next week, it is likely to do just that, so there is a risk of sudden flooding.
The National Weather Service has already issued efficiency warnings for flash flooding on Monday and Tuesday for Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City, including western Arizona, southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah.
Ross is expected to head straight for Phoenix on Tuesday, arriving with late rain on Monday.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix said in a tweet that only "only 10 tropical cyclones have maintained their status or low pressure belt within 200 miles of Phoenix since 1950!"
Hurricane Katrina (1967) was 40 miles from the Arizona border".
The latest National Hurricane Center forecast is 2 to 4 inches of rain, with up to 6 inches of rainfall in Mogollon Rim, Arizona.
Other parts of the Desert Southwest including the Central Rocky and Great Basin are expected to receive 1 to 2 inches of rainfall, while in the tropical areas it is likely to receive up to 4 inches of rain.
For those who are out of danger of sudden flooding, the rain from Rosa will be beneficial as the region is hit by drought.
While flooding is a concern, a little rain may be beneficial as the Southwest is currently facing a drought.
According to U.S. Draft Monitor, more than 40 percent of Arizona is experiencing a low-intensity drought, the second highest category", weather.com reported.
First, the path of Hurricane Rosa will wind up on the Baja California Peninsula in Mexico.
The Rosa winds were up to 85 miles per se on Sunday, and it was 385 miles south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, and moving north at 12 miles per hour.
The storm is facing colder waters in the Pacific, which is reducing its strength.
As such, it is expected to reach Mexico in the form of a tropical storm on Monday afternoon or evening.
Heavy rainfall can occur throughout parts of Mexico, which poses a significant risk of flooding.
"From Baja California to northwest Sonora, rainfall is expected to be 3 to 6 inches, which can drop to 10 inches", reports weather.com.
Rosa will then move north of Mexico as a tropical storm in the form of a tropical low pressure belt before reaching the Arizona border early Tuesday morning, then moving through Arizona and entering southern Utah on Tuesday night.
"The major crisis due to the impact of the Rosa or its balance is that heavy rainfall could occur in Baja California, northwest Sonora, and the U.S. Desert Southwest", the National Hurricane Center said.
The rainfall is likely to cause deadly floods and landslides, as well as landslides in the mountainous region.
Midsomer Norton attack: Four people arrested on murder charges
Three minors and a 20-year-old man have been arrested on suspicion of attempting to murder a 16-year-old boy in Somerset.
The minor boy was found in his wounded position at around 04:00 BST on Saturday in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton.
He was taken to hospital where his condition was reported to be "stable".
A 17-year-old from the Radstock area, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man were arrested overnight, Somerset Police said.
The officials have urged everyone who has mobile footage of the incident to come forward.
Trump said Keveno was "selfish, angry" with the Democratic Party.
"One vote for Judge Keveno is a vote to deny the Democratic Party's brutal and provocative behavior", Trump told a meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kevenough has been "selfish, angry" with the Democratic Party throughout his nomination process.
Kevenow testified before Congress on Thursday, strongly and emotionally denying the allegations of sexual abuse against Christine Blessy Ford when she was a minor.
Ford also confirmed his accusations in the hearing.
The president said Saturday that "the American people saw Keveno's intelligence and quality and adventure".
"The affirmation of Judge Keveno is the affirmation of the most successful legal expert of our time, a judge with a distinguished public service career", he told a crowd of West Virginia supporters.
The President, speaking about the importance of Republican votes in the midterm elections, inadvertently mentioned Keveno's candidacy.
One of the most important elections of our lifetime is five weeks away.
I'm not standing, but I'm really standing", he said.
"That's why I'm fighting big candidates everywhere".
Trump claimed that Democrats are on a campaign to "resist and disrupt".
A senior GOP leadership associate told CNN that the Senate's first major procedural vote on Keveno's candidacy is expected by Friday.
Hundreds of dead, deaths from earthquakes, tsunamis and tsunami in Indonesia are on the rise.
After a massive earthquake and tsunami hit the coastline on Sulawesi Island, Indonesia, at least 384 people were killed, many of them displaced, officials said on Saturday.
On Friday, hundreds of people gathered on the shores of the city of Palú for a celebration when a six-meter (18-foot) high wave hit the shore, carrying many dead and destroying everything along the way.
The tsunami came after a 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
"When the tsunami threat emerged yesterday, people were doing their jobs on the coast and they did not leave immediately and they were killed", said Sutopo Purwo Ngroho, a spokesman for the Indonesian disaster relief agency BNPB, to reporters in Jakarta.
"The tsunami did not come alone, it was carrying cars, goats, houses, dragged, it destroyed everything on the ground", said Ngrohro, adding that the tsunami travelled through the open sea at a speed of 800 kph (497 mph) before hitting the coast.
He said that some people climbed trees and survived the tsunami.
About 16700 people were rescued from 24 centres in Palu.
Aerial photographs released by the Disaster Management Agency showed many buildings and shops destroyed, bridges bent and collapsed and a mosque surrounded by water.
Even afterwards, the coastal city was still hit by earthquakes on Saturday.
This series of earthquakes was felt in the region of 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian Institute of Applied Technology and Applications (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy generated by the massive earthquake on Friday was 200 times more than the power of the Hiroshima bomb dropped during World War II.
The geography of the city, which is located on a long, narrow bay, may have increased the size of the tsunami, it said.
Nugroho described the damage as "extensive", saying that thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels were destroyed.
He said that the bodies of some people trapped under the rubble of the collapsed buildings have been recovered, he said that 540 people were injured and 29 are missing.
Nugroho said that the area 300 kilometers north of Palu, downstream, in a region called Donggala, may have been the most deadly and damaged, which was near the epicenter of the quake.
The communication was "completely disrupted", said Nugroho, with no information from the Dongla.
More than 300,000 people live here", the Red Cross said in a statement, saying staff and volunteers were heading towards the affected areas.
"It is already a crisis, but the situation can get worse", it says.
Officials said that the alert was issued during the period of the incident, but the institute was widely criticized on Saturday for not reporting the tsunami hit Palu.
In an amateur footage posted on social media, a man standing on the top floor of a building is heard warning of a tsunami warning to people on the street below.
Within minutes, a wall of water collapsed on the shore, and buildings and cars were swept away.
This footage was not immediately confirmed by Reuters.
The earthquake and tsunami severely cut power and cut off communication around the valley, making it difficult for the authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
The army has started sending cargo planes from Jakarta and other cities, but rescued people are in dire need of food and other basic facilities, officials said.
The airport of the city has been reopened for relief only and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo will visit rescue centres in Palo on Sunday.
The death toll from the Indonesian tsunami has reached 800.
This is very bad.
World Vision personnel have arrived safely in the city of Paluu where staff have erected a grid of stalls in their office premises, they saw the sight of destruction on the way, Shri Dosheba said.
"They told me that they saw many houses destroyed", he said.
This is very bad.
While relief groups have begun to prepare for disaster response, some have complained that experienced foreign aid workers are being encouraged to go to Pallu.
According to Indonesian rules, only foreign funds, supplies and personnel can go there if the disaster site is declared a national disaster area.
That has not happened yet.
"The disaster is a provincial one", said the spokeswoman for the Indonesian Red Cross, Alia Ariani.
"Why did the government once say, 'Well, this is a national disaster,' then we would open up to international assistance, but that's not the case yet".
When the second night in Palo after the earthquake and tsunami on Friday came, the friends and families of the missing still hope that they will find their loved ones by miracles as such stories are found in natural disasters.
On Saturday, a young boy was pulled out of the gutter.
On Sunday, rescuers freed a woman who had been trapped under a rock with her mother's body for two days.
Two paraclimbers trained for the Asian Games earlier this month in Indonesia are missing by the Indonesian National Paraclimbing Team coach, Gendon Subandono.
Mr. Mandandi said that among those trapped in the Roa Roa Hotel were his students.
As a senior in the paragliding industry, I have my own emotional burden on me", he said.
Shri said that within hours of the news of the collapse of the Roa Roa Hotel spread to the paragliding community, he had hastily sent a WhatsApp message to the Palu contestants attending the Beach Festival.
However, their messages, instead of two blue marks, were left with only one slight mark.
"I think that means they haven't gotten the message", he said.
The bank robbers took $26,750 from the ATM at Levi's, Newport.
The Newport Police Department reported that while the robbers were paying at an ATM in Levi's, Newport, they stole $26,750 from a brink employee on Friday morning.
The driver of the car was clearing an ATM in the entertainment complex and was preparing to bring in more money, Detective Dennis McCarthy said in the paper.
While he was busy, another man "hurried in behind the Brink's employee" and snatched a bag of money for delivery.
Witnesses witnessed several suspects fleeing the scene, but the police did not say the exact number of people involved.
If you have any information about the identity of the person, please contact the Newport Police at 859-292-3680.
Kenny West: The rapper changed his name to Y.
Rapper Kenny West has changed his name to .
Announcing the change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: "It was formally called Kenya West".
West, 41, had a nickname for some time and had taken the title Moniker for his eighth album, released in June.
The change comes ahead of his presentation on Saturday Night Live, where he expects to launch his new album.
He's replacing singer Ariana Grande who, according to the producer, left the show "for emotional reasons".
As an acronym for his current business name, West has previously said that the word is of religious importance to him.
"I think 'it' is the most common word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'you,'" West said earlier this year, discussing his album title with radio host Big Boy.
So I am you, I am you, we.
This change has come from Kenya, which is the only one, it's just come, our best, our worst, our confusion, everything, to the net reflection.
This album is more of a reflection of who we are".
He's one of the popular rappers who changed their name.
Sean Combs is known by various names like Puff Daddy, P. Daddy or Didi, but this year he announced that he likes the names Love and Brother Love.
The former West Coordinator, J-Z, has also made such changes with or without a hyphen and capitals.
AMLO of Mexico swore not to use military force against civilians.
Mexican presidential candidate Andres Manuel López Obrador has sworn never to use military force against civilians in the wake of the 50th anniversary of bloody action against students.
Lopez Obrador pledged at Lateloco Plaza on Saturday that he would "never use the military to intimidate Mexicans".
On October 2, 2168, soldiers fired shots at peaceful protesters, killing about 300 people, during which time left-wing student movements took root throughout Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has vowed to support the studying young Mexicans with monthly subsidies and open more free public universities.
He said that youths are turning to gangs due to unemployment and lack of educational opportunities.
The United States should double the amount of AI funding.
As China becomes more active in artificial intelligence, investor and AI entrepreneur Kai-fu Li has said that the US should double its research spending in this field, and Lee has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The United States has no formal AI policy, but this response came after various departments of the US government announced AI.
Meanwhile, China launched its plan last year, which aims to become No. 1 in AI innovation by 2030.
"The double AI research budget would be a good start, because all other countries are way behind the United States, and we're looking forward to the next revolution in AI", Lee said.
Li said in an interview with CNBC this week that doubling the funding would double the chances of the next big breakthrough in AI in the United States.
Lee's book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, CEO of Cyanovation Ventures, which has invested in Face++, one of China's leading AI companies.
In the 1980s, he worked at Carnegie Mellon University on an AI system that beat out the top-rated American Othello player, and later became an executive at Microsoft Research and president of Google's China branch.
Lee mentioned previous U.S. government technology competitions such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's Robotics Challenge and asked when the next competition would be held, to help find the next predictors.
Researchers in the United States have to work hard to get government grants, Lee said.
"China is not taking academics away, corporations are taking them away", Li said.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have hired top-notch people from universities to work on AI in recent years.
Lee said that the changes in immigration policy will also help the United States to strengthen its AI efforts.
"I think that the green cards should be automatically issued for PhDs in AI.
The State Council of China issued its next generation AI development plan in July 2017.
Li said that the National Science Foundation of China provides funding to people in educational institutions in the same way that the National Science Foundation of China and other government agencies in the United States provide funding to researchers, but the quality of educational work in China is poor.
Earlier this year, the US Department of Defense established a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, where partners from industry and education will be formed, and the White House announced the establishment of a Selection Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
And this month, DARPA announced that it will invest $2 billion in an initiative called AI Next.
In the case of NSF, it currently invests over $100 million a year in AI research.
Meanwhile, a US law aimed at creating a National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence has been unpopular for months.
The Macedonian people voted to change the name of their country.
Macedonians voted on Sunday for a referendum on whether to change the name of their country to the Republic of North Macedonia, an act that would resolve their decades-long dispute with Greece, which has banned its membership in the European Union and NATO.
With Macedonia in Greece, they insist that the name of their northern neighbor is claimant to its territory and that the country has exercised its right to refuse entry into NATO and the EU.
The two governments reached an agreement in June based on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents claim that the name change would erode the ethnic identity of Macedonia's Slavic majority population.
President George Ivanov said that we will not vote in this referendum and the boycott campaign has raised doubts that the voter turnout will be at least 50 percent needed to pass the referendum.
The question on the referendum ballot is: "Are you in favour of NATO and EU membership by agreeing to a deal with Greece?"
Including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, proponents of the name change claim that this is a cost to Macedonia to pursue entry into institutions like the EU and NATO, a country that emerged after the breakup of Yugoslavia.
I am here today to vote for the future of my country, the young people of Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the same umbrella of the European Union because it means a safer life for all of us", said 79-year-old Olivera Giorgiveska, a Scopea resident.
Although not legally binding, a sufficient number of MPs have said that we will follow the outcome of this vote to make it decisive.
The name change would require a two-thirds majority in Parliament.
The National Election Commission said that there was no irregularity as of 1 pm.
However, the turnout was only 16%, compared to 34% in the last parliamentary election in 2016 when 66% of registered voters voted.
I'm out voting for my children, our place is in Europe", said 62-year-old Jose Tanesky, a voter in Skopje, the capital.
Prime Minister Zoran Zahaev, his wife Zorica and son Dusko voted in a referendum on changing the name of the country on 30 September 2018 in Strumika, Macedonia.
In Skopje, in front of Parliament, Vladimir Kavardarkov, a 54-year-old housewife, is setting up a small platform and setting up chairs in front of tents for the anti-sovereignty protesters.
We are on the side of NATO and the EU, but we want to participate with a tight grip, not through the back door", said Kvardarkov.
Our country is poor, but we have self-respect.
If they don't want us to be recognized as Macedonia, we can go to other countries like China and Russia and become part of Euro-Asia coordination".
Prime Minister Zahaev said that NATO membership will bring much needed investment to Macedonia, as it has an unemployment rate of over 20 per cent.
"I think the majority of people will support because more than 80 percent of our citizens are supporters of the EU and NATO", Zaev said after the vote.
He said that if the result was "yes" it would be "confirmation of our future".
A poll published by the Macedonian Institute for Policy Research on Monday said that 30 to 43 percent of voters would participate in the referendum.
Another poll conducted by Macedonia's Telma TV found that 57 percent of people planned to vote on Sunday.
Of these, 70 percent said they would vote yes.
To be successful in this referendum, a vote of 50 per cent plus one vote is required.
If this referendum fails, the policy of the West-Darijan government, which came to power in May last year, will be hit for the first time.
Look: Manchester City's Sergio Aguero made his way through the entire Brighton defensive line for the goal.
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling beat Manchester City 2-0 on Saturday at the Brighton Shield at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero's goal in the 65th minute was very easy.
The Argentine striker and the starting quarterback got a pass in the middle of the field.
He ran through three of Brighton's defenders before hitting a free-kick.
After that, Aguero was surrounded by four green shirts.
He pushed the ball around a defender and then he hit a bunch of people on the side of the Brighton box.
And then he pushed a pass to his left, and there was Sterling.
The English forward returned the ball to the forward with his first touch in the box, and he used his right boot to hit Brighton keeper Matthew Ryan on the right side of the net.
Aguero's foot is having some problems", City Manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
"We used to say he plays 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky that he scored that goal".
But Sky Blue managed to take the lead in the Stirling Premier League.
The goal came in the 29th minute.
Aguero got the ball inside the Brighton area at the time.
He sent the ball to Leroy Sen on the left in a beautiful way.
Sen took a few touches and then Sterling led towards the remote post.
The Sky Blues forward tapped the net just before he left the line.
City will play Hofnhäim in the Champions League at 12:55 pm in Rhein-Neckar-Arena, Sinheim, Germany.
Sherzer wants to play a game of cat and mouse against the Rockies.
With the Nationals out of the series, there was little reason to start another big start.
But Sherzerna, always ready for the tournament, is expected to face the challenge against the Colorado Rockies on Sunday, but if it still benefits from playing a series game for the Rockies, who have taken a game lead over the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West.
The Rockies won a wild-card berth with a 5-2 win over the Nationals on Friday night, but they're still waiting to fight for their first division title.
"While we're not playing for anything, knowing that Denver will be a busy place will allow us to come up behind the rubber and play a second team at a high level I've never played at any point in my career.
Why wouldn't I want to compete in it?"
The Nationals have not yet announced a starter for Sunday, but they may have a reported tendency to let Sherzer come on in such a situation.
Sherzer, who is about to make his 34th start, held a bullpen session on Thursday and will be on his usual schedule on Sunday.
The Washington right-hander is 18-7 with a 2.53 ERA this season and has 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings.
Trump took a meeting in West Virginia.
Speaking about the importance of the Republican presence in the midterm elections, the President mentioned the indicator of the situation surrounding Supreme Court-appointed Brett Kevenough.
Everything we've done is going to be tested in November.
We are five weeks away from the most important election of our lifetime.
This is one of the biggest, biggest -- I'm not fighting, but I'm really fighting, so I'm going everywhere for big candidates.
Trump added, "You see this terrible, terrible radical group of Democrats, you see this is happening right now.
And they are determined to regain power by whatever means necessary, you see, this selfishness, this cruelty.
They don't care who we hurt, who we step on to get power and control, so they want power and control, we're not going to give it to them".
He said the Democrats are on a campaign to "resist and block".
And you've seen it for the last four days", he said, calling the Democrats "aggressive and selfish and cruel and lying".
He mentioned that the Senate Judiciary Committee had given a score to Democratic Senator Diane Finstein, which was applauded by the audience.
Do you remember her answer?
Did you release the document?
Ah, ah, what.
No, uh, no, I'm waiting for one. It was a really bad body language. It was the worst body language I've ever seen".
Labor is no longer a broad church.
He does not tolerate what our minds say.
When the activists in my Movementum voted to convict me, it was no surprise.
After all, I am the newest member of the Labour MPs who are not welcome, just for talking about our minds.
My fellow parliamentarian, John Ryan, was treated in the same way because she took a strong stand against anti-Semitism.
In my case, I was criticized for not agreeing with Jeremy Corbyn in the condemnation resolution.
The importance of national security, a responsible economic policy for Europe, unfortunately, are the same issues that Jeremy disagreed with his former leaders on.
Nottingham East Labour said at a meeting on Friday that "we want to be inclusive and productive in meetings".
For most of my eight years as a local Labour MP, the GC meetings on Friday nights were the same.
Unfortunately, today, many meetings do not have this atmosphere, and the promise of "more kind, more polite", if it really begins, is forgotten.
It is becoming increasingly clear that opposition voices are not tolerated in the Labour Party and each vote is being weighed on the basis of whether it is acceptable to the party leadership.
It started shortly after Jeremy became leader, because I had expressed similar political views before, and colleagues began to expect me to go around and take on a role I would never have otherwise agreed to - be it national security or the EU Single Market.
When I speak openly, and it doesn't really matter what I say, I get a wave of slander on social media, I get told to vote out, I get told to protest the politics of the Centre, I shouldn't be in the Labour Party.
And this is not just my experience.
In fact, I'm more fortunate than some of my colleagues because the reactions to me are political.
I am amazed at the professional and determined nature of these friends who are not hesitant to face the rains of sexual or racist abuse every day.
One of the biggest frustrations of this era of politics is the normalization of the level of waste.
Jeremy Corbyn last week voted that the Labour Party should cultivate a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer so liberal that every "disbelief" proposal or change in election rules will lead to the party collapsing.
I've had a lot of advice over the last couple of years, with a request to keep my head down and not talk anymore, so I'm going to be okay.
But that's not what I came here to do in politics.
I am saddened by the fact that my school has virtually collapsed due to the negligence of the Thatcher government. Since I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago as a school student, I have been demanding better public service for those who are in desperate need as a local municipal servant or government minister.
I have never hidden my politics from the last election.
No one in Nottingham East can be confused in any way about the status of my policies and the area of disagreement with my current leadership.
To all those who supported this proposal on Friday, I would like to say that the country is moving towards Brexit, which will adversely affect families, businesses and our social services, I cannot understand the desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the Labour Party leader.
But the truth is that I have a message not for the Nottingham Movement, but for the people in my constituency, whether they are Labour or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise you that no threat of resignation or political justification can discourage me from my work, which I think is in the best interest of all of you.
Chris Leslie is an MP from Nottingham East.
Ir 38  17 Melrose: Unconquered Ir reached the top
The two delayed Trojans may have had some negative impact on the final result, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserved a day-long win in the Amazing-Enjoyable Tenants Premiership.
They are now at the top of the table, the only undefeated team out of ten.
After all, his defense was as good as his excellent catch-up skills, which gave the local team and coach Peter Mercy the full right to be happy.
"We have been tested for our game and we are still undefeated, so I am happy", he said.
Robin Christian of Mellorose said: "The credit goes to Irene, who took advantage of the opportunities better than we did.
Grant Anderson's 14th minute try, played by Frazier Climo, gave Ayr the lead, but a yellow card released by Warriors for Scotland cap Rory Hughes allowed Melrose to score points and Jason Baggott pulled the try in an unassailable draw.
Klymo led Ayr with a penalty half-time ahead, then reversed Ayr with a single try to take a 17-5 lead at halftime.
But Mellorose got off to a good start in the second half and cut the five-point gap by reversing Patrick Anderson's try bag.
The game was then delayed for a long time by a serious injury to Ruariddh Knot, who was moved from the stretcher and further progressed through Clymo's refresher to the trial of Ayr Stafford McDowell from the start.
Ireland's season captain, Blair McPherson, was later awarded a yellow card, and again, Mellorose took advantage of an extra player with an unchanging Bruce Calvin's try at the end of a highly stressed left.
The local team later returned, but, and when tackling the ball without a ball out of the penalty line, Strawan Hutchinson was given a yellow card and McPherson scored a touchdown from behind, defeating the forward Ayr.
After catching David Armstrong's box kick by Kyle Rowe and sending the flanker away to Gregor Henry for a fifth try for the local team, Climo transformed him as he had done at the time of the reboot.
Steel Game Star is looking to try his career in the hotel industry.
After learning that Steel Game star Ford Keernan has been appointed as a director of a licensed restaurant company, he took the step to turn to the hospitality industry.
The 56-year-old played Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC show, which he co-wrote and co-starred with longtime comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
The couple have announced that the upcoming ninth series of the show will be the final, and Keernan is planning her life after her work at Craigslist.
According to the official record listing, he is a director of Adriftmorne Limited.
Although a Scottish Sun source suggested that Kirn would be involved in the burgeoning restaurant business of Glasgow, the actor declined to comment on the matter.
The sea is ours: The court hopes that the landlocked Bolivia will pave the way for the Pacific.
The sailors patrol the rigging-cloud naval headquarters in La Paz.
Sky-colored flags fly on public buildings.
From Lake Titicaca to the Amazon, the following slogans are visible at the bottom of the sea:
It is our duty to get it.
The memories of the beaches lost in the bloody conflict with Chile from 19th century resources throughout the landlocked Bolivia are still alive today - as if one could sail the Pacific Ocean once again.
Those hopes are perhaps the highest of the decade, as Bolivia awaits a decision by the International Court of Justice on October 1 after five years of deliberation.
Bolivia has momentum, a zeal for unity and courage, and of course, expects positive results from the outcome, said Bolivian Ambassador Roberto Kazedela.
Many Bolivians will watch the ICs on a large screen across the country, in the hope that the tribunal in The Hague will settle Bolivia's claims. After decades of ups and downs, Chile has accepted the obligation to negotiate an autonomous route to the sea for Bolivia.
Bolivia's attractive local president Evo Morales, who is facing a controversial re-election campaign next year, is also largely dependent on Monday's resignation.
At the end of August, he promised, "We are very close to returning to the Pacific Ocean".
But some analysts say that the court is unlikely to rule in favor of Bolivia and that the situation will not change much.
The Netherlands-based UN has no right to assign Chilean territory, and they have agreed not to decide the outcome of any possible talks.
The final argument was held just six months after the ICJ was elected, which indicated that the case was not "complicated", said international law expert Paz Zarrate of Chile.
And in moving forward for the Bolivian cause, it must have been pushed back by the last four years.
The issue of obtaining sea passage has been hijacked by the current Bolivian administration, Zarrate said.
Morales' aggressive rhetoric has destroyed the reputation of Chile's remaining people, he suggested.
Bolivia and Chile will start negotiations at some point, but after that, it will be very difficult to negotiate.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
The representative of Bolivia in The Hague, former President Eduardo Rodriguez Welze, has denied the unusual dynamics of the court's decision-making process.
He said that it will be a wonderful opportunity for Bolivia to launch a new era of relations with Chile on Monday and to put an end to 139 years of disagreement on mutual benefits.
Morales is still the most popular leader in Latin America, even denied by Calzodilla, saying he was using the maritime affair as a political bait.
Bolivia will never give up its right to access the Pacific Ocean, he added.
This is an opportunity to see what the past needs to overcome.
North Korea said it would not disarm unless it trusted the US.
North Korean Foreign Minister Lee Yong Ho said that if his country does not trust Washington, it will never disarm its nuclear weapons first.
He was speaking at the General Assembly of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh.
He called on the UN to honour the pledges made during the Singapore Meeting between the two rivals.
His opinion is at a time when US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is on track to resume the nuclear politics that had been in shambles for more than three months after a visit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Singapore.
Re said this was a vision blunder that kept the sanctions and U.S. aggression on such a declaration, which would end the Korean War and bring North Korea to its knees.
Washington is aware of the acceptance of the Declaration without Pyongyang taking the first significant step towards disarmament.
Kim and US President Donald Trump both want a second meeting.
But Pyongyang is very suspicious of being serious about abandoning its science library, because it considers it the only way to guarantee its security.
Pompeo is planning to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for the second Kim-Trump summit.
At the Paris fashion show, we presented a range of latest models that are so vast that they can reach you on a major road near you.
If you want to increase your collection of hats or want full sun protection, look nowhere else.
Designers Valentino and Tom Brownie presented a range of large sized, distinctive hats for their SS19 collections, which led to a style that was a hallmark of the Paris Fashion Week.
This summer, extremely unrealistic hats appeared on Instagram and these designers sent their spectacular creations for catwalks.
A distinctive piece of Valentino was an over-the-top pink hat, decorated with a wide edge like a pie, which adorned the heads of models nicely.
Other larger accessories included a precious gem-decorated necklace, a magic hat, and an anise, but they weren't designed to keep your head warm.
Tom Brownie also introduced a range of these amazing masks -- and that was also during Halloween.
Many colorful masks had lipsticks sewn and looked more like a Hannibal lecturer than a fashion model.
One structure was like a scuba diving gear, with a hood and goggles, while the other looked like a melted ice cream cone.
And if you can use this huge fashion statement, you're lucky.
Those who observe these styles predict that they will be found in large numbers on the main roads near you.
The super-sized hats were seen rising on the long tails, with a two-foot wide spike on the heads of straw hats, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajovsky.
The highly impractical hat behind the communal mark that was named on social media sent another large design for a catwalk - a straw beach bag, like a swimsuit-suited teen model would have taken to a young child.
The dark orange Rafia bag with a white leather handle on the top, carved by Rafia Zhaler, was the best piece in the Jacques La Riviera SS19 collection at the Paris Fashion Week.
Famous stylist Luke Armitage told Female: 'I was expecting big hats and beach bags to come to the main street for next summer  The designer made such a huge impact that it would be hard to ignore the demand for this oversized device.'
John Edward: Language skills are essential for global citizens.
Independent schools in Scotland maintain a record for academic excellence, and it has continued to do so in 2018, with another set of unusual test results added, which are credited solely to individual and collective success in sport, the arts, music and other community activities.
With over 30,000 students across Scotland, these schools are represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), which strives to provide the best possible quality of service for their students and parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare their students for further and higher education, their chosen careers and their place as a global citizen.
As an educational sector that can design and implement prescribed school curricula, we are looking at modern languages as a popular and desirable subject of choice in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you talk to someone in a language they understand, it goes straight into their head".
If you speak in a language that is understood, it will go straight to the heart.
It is very important to remember that we cannot rely on English alone to build relationships and trust with people in other countries.
From the results of the recent examination this year, we can see that languages are ranking top in the league tables with the highest pass rates among the independent schools.
68% of students who studied foreign languages got a high grade A.
Data collected from 74 SCIS member schools showed that 72 percent of students in Mandarin received a high grade A, while the number of German learners was 72 percent, the number of French learners was 69 percent and the number of Spanish learners who received a grade was 63 percent.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as critical skills, which will undoubtedly be needed by children and young people in the future.
As a subject of choice, language is now being understood in the curricula of independent schools and elsewhere as STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) subjects.
A 2014 survey by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills found that language skills deficiency was responsible for 17 per cent of the reasons employer-given reasons for filling vacancies.
Therefore, language skills are becoming increasingly essential for young people to prepare for their future careers.
These skills have become essential in a globalized world, with more potential job opportunities requiring language.
Regardless of the career they choose, if they learn a second language, they can gain real benefits in the future by having lifelong skills like this.
The ability to communicate directly with people from abroad will automatically put the multilingual person at the forefront of the competition.
According to a 2013 survey of more than 4,000 UK adults, 75 percent of the population were unable to communicate in a foreign language, and only 15 percent of the population could speak French at double digits.
This is why the investment in language teaching is important for today's children.
Multilingualism, especially in the developing economies, will create better opportunities for children to get meaningful jobs.
In Scotland, every school teaches different languages.
Many schools focus on more sophisticated modern languages, while others teach languages that are considered to be most important for the UK as we look forward to 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
No matter what your child is interested in, there are plenty of languages to choose from in independent schools, and there are also teachers who are experts in teaching in relevant fields.
Scottish independent schools are dedicated to providing an educational environment that will prepare and equip students with the skills to succeed no matter what the future holds.
In a global business environment, there is no denying that language is so important to the future of a country that it is imperative that it be reflected in education.
Indeed, modern languages should be considered as international communication skills.
Independent Schools will continue to provide this choice, diversity and excellence for the young people of Scotland.
Il Fort Bien Le Fair.
John Edward is the Director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools.
LeBron is making his debut with the Lakers on Sunday in San Diego.
The fan's wait to see LeBron James play his first game for the Los Angeles Lakers is almost over.
Lakers coach Luke Walton announced that James will play Denver Nuggets in the Sunday preseason opener in San Diego.
But he still has to decide how many minutes he'll play.
"It will be more than one and less than 48", Walton said on the Lakers' official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudeau tweeted that James has a limited playing time.
After practice earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers' pre-season schedule of six games.
He said, "I don't need pre-season play to prepare at this stage of my career.
Trump's time in the West Virginia rally, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump has launched a rally campaign at Wheeling, West Virginia, tonight.
This was the first of Trump's five scheduled rallies next week, with stops in their favourite locations, including Tennessee and Mississippi.
With a confirmation vote held for his election to fill a vacancy on the Supreme Court, Trump is aiming to raise support for the upcoming midterm elections, as Republicans fear they will lose control of Congress when elections are held in November.
What time is Trump's rally in West Virginia tonight, and how can you watch it online?
Trump's Wheeling, West Virginia rally is scheduled for 7 p.m. ET tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump's rally in West Virginia online via a live stream on YouTube.
Trump may address this week's hearing for Supreme Court nominee Brett Cavanaugh, who has been strained by allegations of sexual misconduct that have delayed a Senate confirmation for an expected week for an FBI investigation.
But the main purpose of these rallies is to help give some momentum to the Republicans who are facing the November elections.
Thus, the Trump campaign has stated that the purpose of these five rallies next week is to stir up enthusiasm among volunteers and supporters as the Republicans seek to protect and increase the majority in the Senate and House of Representatives, according to Reuters.
"Congress control is so important to their agenda that as we move forward with this busy campaign season, the president will travel to as many states as possible", Trump's campaign spokesman told Reuters without revealing his name.
The rally scheduled for tonight at the Wesbank Arena in Wheeling could attract large numbers of supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania and receive coverage from the Pittsburgh media, West Virginia Metro News said.
This will be the second visit to West Virginia on Saturday in a month, from which it won more than 40 percent of the points in 2016.
West Virginia Republican Senate candidate Patrick Morrissey, who is lagging behind in the Trump election, is trying to help.
"It's not a good sign for Morrissey that the president is coming to help him in this election", said political scientist Simon Heider of West Virginia University.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA has shown a keen interest in keeping such a live as they move to Sunday Singles.
After three separate sessions, the squadron of Saturday afternoon gave the Ryder Cup its desired performance.
The concept of the helkawe-eating sensation is a concept that's entirely found in games, but it's one thing that players can completely trust, and it's never more than competition.
So they're going to say where is this sensation now?
"They had a six-point lead and now it's four, so I think we're getting a little bit faster now", said Jordan Spitth, leaving at the end of the day.
Europe is in a favourable position, of course, with four points ahead and twelve more to play.
Americans think, Spith says, that even though their balls are in the way of low winds, and they have a lot to encourage, not just the form of Spith and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and scored three points each out of four.
Spith has been aggressive from Tea to Green and his leadership is exemplary.
The celebration rounds began to grow, and when he and Thomas were two behind two, they took the key and edited all four squares.
The screams he had about his bracelet that was responsible for winning the game when he was 15, would have made you believe that the Americans are still in the race.
"You really have to make more effort and take care of your own game", Spith said.
Now it's about what each player has left behind.
There are 18 holes to make a mark.
The only players with more points than Spith and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, from the Ryder Cup debates.
Europe's most competitive, but attractive pair got four out of four, and there was nothing wrong with that.
They were the only couple who couldn't shoot a bug on Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided the bug on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and backed up the bug on Friday morning at 9:00.
The run, and the enthusiasm behind the roaring crowd, made it look like they were the losers on Sunday, and as the sun began to set at Le Golf National, no other popular player could have been there besides Fleetwood and Molinari to sustain a possible European victory.
If there were two holes on different holes at the same time, it would be more appropriate.
Yet, the story of European fame was premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson cut back on the work of Sergio Garcia, the morning forebolder, when he was paired with Alex Noren.
The Spaniards and Swedes, who had a boxer and two doubles on the front nine, never got close to a hole.
On Sunday, though, there was no one out of your hole to help you.
The reason for the fascination with foreballs and forums was the harmony between the pairs, the advice they gave and the advice they didn't give, and the way they could change in an instant.
Europe has played well as a team, so they took a significant lead on the final day, but even during this forum session Team USA showed a fighting attitude, especially on the Stateside, where there was suspicion.
Europe took a 10-6 lead on the final day of the Ryder Cup.
Europe will gain a strong lead on the Ryder Cup final day with a 10-6 lead over the United States after coming out of Saturday's Forboles and Forsooms matches.
The inspired pair of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the match with two wins over the struggling Tiger Woods and took their score to four points at Le Golf National.
Defeated at Hazeltyne two years ago, Thomas Jorn's European side won the series 3-1 over the American side who had played poorly in the morning Foursquare in an attempt to retain the trophy.
Europe fought harder in the Forums and won the Dr. Games, but they couldn't afford to lose.
Jim Forkie's team needed eight points from 12 Sunday singles matches to retain the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European player to win four points in a row, while he and Molinari, who were nicknamed 'Mollywood', were the only pair to win all four of their opening four matches in Ryder Cup history after a thrilling weekend.
After defeating Woods and Patrick Reed in the Forboles, he defeated desperate Woods and the Bryson Dashboys of the United States by 5 and 4 with even more chances in the match of the match.
Woods, who pulled himself down by two games on Saturday, will occasionally show a selection of excellence, but he has now lost 19 of his 29 games in the Forboles and Forthums and seven in a row.
After a break from the morning Foerballs, Justin Rose returned to the Forums with partner Henrik Stenson, beating world-ranked Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka 2 and 1.
On a fragrant, windy day in southwest Paris, nothing happened to make Europe fit.
Three-time major champions Jordan Spith and Justin Thomas set the benchmark for the Americans with two points on Saturday.
He won the Forboles by 2 and 1 against the Spaniards John Rahm and Ian Polter in a tight match and then came back after losing the opening two holes in the Forwards, defeating Polter and Rory McIlroy 4 and 3.
Although the former winner Furich only needed to make a draw to retain his teammates, there have been two times in Ryder Cup history when a team made a four-point return from a gap in the singles.
After being second-best for two days, however, Sunday's match-up felt like they were out of their girlfriends.
North Korea refused to unilaterally disarm without confidence in any way.
The North Korean Foreign Minister told the United Nations on Saturday that the continuing sanctions are building confidence in the United States and that the country will not unilaterally abandon its nuclear weapons in any way.
At the annual general meeting of the World Organization, Lee Yong Hoen said that North Korea had taken "remarkable steps" in the past year, such as halting nuclear and missile tests, destroying nuclear testing sites and pledging not to expand nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
However, we have not received any relevant response from the US, he said.
Without any confidence in the US, we will not have confidence in our national security and in such a situation we will not unilaterally disarm ourselves first.
While Renee Pawan repeated North Korea's usual complaints about Washington's resistance to the phase-out, under which North Korea was to be rewarded for taking steps to halt the nuclear proliferation, his statement is notable in that it did not reject the unilateral shutdown as previously stated by Pyongyang.
At the first meeting between the incumbent US president and the North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, Reyni referred to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump, in which Kim pledged to work towards the non-nuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, while Trump assured North Korea's protection.
North Korea demands a formal end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States has said that Pyongyang must first abandon its nuclear weapons.
Washington also opposed the demand to lift the stringent international sanctions imposed on North Korea.
The US is first pressing for the cessation of nuclear weapons and is forcibly increasing the level of pressure through sanctions to achieve its objectives and also opposing the declaration of an end to war, Re said.
The idea that restrictions will bring us to our knees will remain a notion of those who are ignorant of us .
But the problem is that constant restrictions are losing confidence in us.
Re did not mention any plans for a second meeting between Kim and Trump, which was mentioned earlier this week by U.S. leaders at the United Nations.
Instead, the minister highlighted the three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months, saying: "If South Korea had been a party to this issue of non-nuclearization and not the US, the issue of non-nuclearization of the Korean Peninsula would not have been a puzzle".
However, the tone of Re's speech was dramatically different from last year's speech at the UN General Assembly that it was inevitable to target the US mainland with North Korean rockets, when President Trump called Kim a suicide-targeted rocket man.
This year at the United Nations, Trump, who had threatened to destroy North Korea completely last year, praised Kim for his courageous efforts to disarm, but said there was still much work to be done and that sanctions should continue until North Korea stopped its nuclear program.
On Wednesday, Trump said he had no time frame for this, saying, "It doesn't matter if it took two years, three years, or five months".
China and Russia have argued at the UN that Pyongyang should be rewarded for its actions by the Security Council.
However, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday: "The implementation of the Security Council sanctions must continue swiftly and decisively until the complete, final and verifiable cessation of nuclear proliferation is reached".
The Security Council has unanimously imposed sanctions on North Korea since 2006 to block the supply of funds for Pyongyang's nuclear and explosive missile programs.
Pompeo met with Ri outside and told the UN General Assembly that he will be visiting Pyongyang again next month to prepare for another meeting.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times, but his last visit was not good.
In July, he left Pyongyang as progress had been made, only for North Korea, and he is making a demand like a bunch of demands to announce it in a few hours.
At a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea promised that if the United States took appropriate measures, it would destroy the missile site and, as well, the nuclear complex.
He said that Kim told him that the measures he wanted to take would be the security guarantees Trump promised in Singapore and steps towards normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard students are taking a course on getting enough rest.
Harvard University is bringing a new sleep curriculum for all its undergraduates this year to address the growing masculine culture of overnight wakefulness through caffeine-service.
One educationist found that at one of the world's top universities, they were often found to be ignorant of basic information about how to take care of themselves.
Charles Chisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, has designed a course that is believed to be the first of its kind in the US.
He was inspired to start this course by giving a lecture on the impact of sleep deprivation on education.
And at the end of the summer, a girl came up to me and said, "Why did you tell me this now, when I'm in my final year?
She said that no one had ever told her about the importance of sleep, which I was surprised to learn, she told The Telegraph.
This course, first presented this year, explains how students and athletes need good sleep habits to improve their performance and overall health.
Paul Barrera, Professor of Psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and Executive Director of University Health Services, said the university has decided to launch the course after finding that students have been severely sleep deprived for a week.
The one-hour course has a series of interactive objectives.
One area has images of a dorm room, with students drinking coffee, and curtains, coaches and books telling about the effects of caffeine and light and how lack of sleep affected athletes' performance and the importance of sleep regulation.
In the second part, participants are being told how prolonged sleep deprivation increases the risk of heart attacks, strokes, depression and cancer.
A map of the campus with interactive icons then encourages participants to think about their routine.
We know that this will not change the behaviour of students immediately.
But we believe that they have a right to know, just as you have a right to know the health effects of smoking, Professor Chizler added.
The culture of pride in waking up all night is still alive, he said, with the emphasis on modern technology and the ever-increasing pressure on students, which means sleep deprivation was a growing problem.
Ensuring good quality, adequate sleep should be a secret weapon for overcoming stress, fatigue and anxiety of the student, he said, as well as preventing weight gain, because depriving the brain of sleep leaves it hungry and constantly makes them hungry.
Raymond Gold, a 19-year-old student of chemical and physical biology, helped Professor Chizler design the course, which he took last year during his first year at Harvard.
He said that the course opened his eyes and inspired him to promote the campus-wide course.
He hopes that in the next phase, all graduate students will be told to complete courses like this before entering a competitive institution.
Professor Chizler recommends that students set an alarm to tell when to go to sleep and when to get up, and be aware of the harmful effects of blue light emitted by electronic screens and LEDs, which can disrupt the rhythm of the clock in your body, causing sleep problems.
Livingstone 1  0 Rangers: Mega's goal to the Gerard team
The Rangers were hit by another blow when Dolly Menga's strike defeated Steven Gerrard's disrupted team 1-0 at Livingstone.
The Ibroks were on their way to their first win since a 4-1 victory at St Johnstone in February, but Gary Holt's team only led to Gerard's second defeat of 18 games as manager, leaving his side eight points behind Ladbrokes Premier League-leading Hearts.
Menga kicked seven minutes ahead of halftime and was never seen with a low-motion Rangers team trying to match.
With Rangers now pushed to sixth place, Livingstone has moved up to third place, only behind Hibernian on goal difference.
And it could be a further problem for Rangers because a throw from the other end of the line caused the lineman Calum Spence to have to be treated for a head injury.
Gerard made eight changes to his team, overtaking Ayr's changes in the semi-finals of the Betfred Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, played with the same Levi 11, who had a score from Hart's last week and was very happy with the way he put his opponents in the fray with his good moves at every turn.
Although the Rangers held more of the ball, Livingston used the ball he had more.
He could have scored in just two minutes when the first-season play-off of Meng'a sent Scott Pittman to Ann McGregor's goal, but the midfielder missed his big opportunity.
Keegan Jacobs, on the dive, sent a free-kick to captain Craig Holcott but his defensive partner, Alan Lithgow, came in the back post.
The Rangers took over but their game in the last third showed a lack of confidence.
Alfredo Morelos was adamant that the quarter-hour mark should have been a penalty for his and Steven Lawless' collision, but referee Steven Thompson rejected Colombian's appeal.
Rangers were only able to shoot two first-half shots at the goal but the former Ibrox goalkeeper, Liam Kelly, did not struggle to stop the head of Vasa Colibelli and the unstoppable strikes of Ovi Izaria.
Although Levi's first goal of the 34th minute was against the flow of the game, no one will doubt his hard work.
The Rangers failed once again to match Jacobs' set-piece on the Deep.
When Declan Golger gave the ball to Scott Robinson, Scott Orfield did not react, who quietly chose Menga for easy completion.
Gerard showed efficiency by calling Cobyley in place of Ryan Kent at the break and the change saw immediate results. Morelos on the winger passed but came through his line to block out the formidable player Kelly.
But, with Lithgow and Holcott hitting a long ball back-to-back, Livingston continued to force guests to play their favorite way.
Holt's team could have extended their lead in the final stage, but McGregor stood firmly to prevent Jacobs from reaching the far corner until Lithgow arrived.
Rangers replacement player Glenn Middleton made a late second claim to the penalty on the bat to James but Thompson turned it down again.
Almanac: The inventor of the Geiger counter
And now a page in our Sunday Morning Almanac: 136 years ago today, on September 30, 1882, and beyond... on this day in Germany, the future physicist Jonas William "Hans" Geiger was born.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radiation, an invention that led to the development of the Geiger counter.
Since then, Geiger Counter has also become a mainstream pop culture, as in the 1950s film "Bells of Coronado" featuring scientists who appear to be cowboys, Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: "What is it?"
Rogers: "This is a Geiger counter, which is used to detect radioactive algae like uranium.
When you put on this earphone, you can actually hear the impact of the atoms that are radiating out of the alkali".
Evans: "It's like they're popping up now!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just days before his 63rd birthday.
But the quest that brought his name to life was immortal.
A new cancer vaccine will teach the immune system to "see" malignant cells
A new vaccine for cancer will teach the immune system to "see" and kill malignant cells.
As part of the treatment, vaccines teach the immune system to recognize malignant cells.
This method involves removing immune cells from patients and replacing them in a laboratory.
They can then see the protein common to many cancers and then they're stitched back into the body.
This test is showing positive results in different cancer patients.
A woman was treated with a vaccine that taught her immune system to recognize malignant cells, and her ovarian cancer was found to have gone away for more than 18 months.
This method involves removing immune cells from patients and replacing them in the lab so that they can "see" a protein called HER2, a common protein in many cancers, and then stain it back into the body.
"Our results suggest that we have a very promising vaccine", said Jay Berzowski, professor at the US National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland.
HER2 "causes the growth of many types of cancer", including breast, ovarian, lung and colorectal cancers, Professor Berzowski explained.
Similarly, an approach to "teaching" patients how to attack cancer cells by removing immune cells from their blood can be useful in a type of blood cancer.
Kenny West, wearing a MAGA hat after his appearance on SNL, was sharply criticized by Trump.
He didn't like it.
After a stunning performance by Kenny West in which he praised US President Donald Trump and asked him to contest the 2020 election, people blew up the trail in his studio during his Saturday Night Live.
At night, his Ghost Town, in which he has put on the Make America Great Cap, after singing the third song, he began to yell at the Democrats and once again he declared his support for Trump.
"Sometimes I talk to a white person and they say, 'How can you like Trump, he's racist?'
So, if I was worried about racism, I would have left America a long time ago", he said.
SNL began the show with a sketch starring Matt Damon in which the Hollywood star blew the whistle on Brett Kannu's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee for allegations of sexual assault by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it was not broadcast, footage of West's bust was uploaded to social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It's not clear if Rock was trying to mock the West after posting it.
Also, West complained to the audience that his hat on his head caused him to suffer behind the stage.
"They shouted at me behind the stage.
He said, "Don't go on stage wearing that hat".
They were attacking me!
And then he said, "I'm completely drowned", he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West added, "Have you seen the sinking?" So he said, "They're going to put on my Superman cap, because that means you can't tell me what to do.
Try to love".
His comment was echoed by audiences at least twice and appeared to have been a stalwart of the SNL cast, many said, one of whom told the publication: "Death's silence spread throughout the studio".
West was then replaced by Ariana Grande, whose former lover, rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days earlier.
West confused many by performing the song I Love It in the guise of a Perrier bottle.
West was supported by the head of the conservative TPUSA group, Candace Turner, who tweeted: "For the most courageous of all: Thank you for standing up for the crowd".
But talk show host Karen Hunter tweeted that West was just "as it is and it's truly amazing".
"But I will not reward anyone who practices or spreads such an idea that is harmful to my community (by buying his music or clothes or supporting his 'art').
It's free.
We are also free", she added.
Earlier in the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name and is now "officially known as Kenny West".
He wasn't the first artist to change his name, he followed Diddie, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Daddy.
The fellow rapper, Snoop Dogg, was formerly named Snoop Lion and of course the former music emperor Prince, who changed his name to the icon and was known as Prince before that artist.
Attempted murder in a Belfast restaurant case
A 45-year-old man was charged with attempted murder after he stabbed a man at a restaurant in East Belfast on Friday.
The incident took place in Bellihacomor, police said.
The defendant is expected to appear in Belfast Magistrates' Court on Monday.
The charges will be reviewed by Public Prosecution Service.
The game of thrones star, kit harrington, attacked the toxic masculinity.
Kit Harrington is best known for his role as swordsman John Snow in the HBO violent medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones.
But the 31-year-old actor criticized the masculine hero's acting, saying that such roles on screen seem to make young children feel more comfortable getting respect.
Speaking to Sunday Times Culture, Keith said he believes something is wrong and asked how to deal with the issue of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Recently married to his Game of Thrones co-star, 31-year-old Rose Leslie, Kit admits that he has a 'very strong' desire to solve the problem.
"I personally feel very strongly at this moment - what is wrong with your masculinity?" he said.
'What are we teaching people about the problems we are facing now as they grow up?'
Kit believes that the highly masculine television characters are partly responsible for the rise in toxic masculinity.
He goes on to say: 'What is inherent and what is taught?
Do you think that what is taught on TV and on the streets should be the same thing as what young children have to have to be able to be men?
I think this is really one of the big questions of our time - how do we change that?
Because something must have gone wrong with the young children.'
In the interview, he admitted that he will not be doing a prequel or sequel after the end of Game of Thrones next summer, but he is "bored with the stage and the horses".
Starting in November, Kit will be working on the revival of Sam Shepherd's True West, which is the story of a filmmaker and his thief brother.
The actor recently revealed that the best outcome of Game of Thrones is a visit to his wife Rose.
'I met my wife on this show, so in that sense he gave me my future family and my life after that,' he said.
In the Emmy Award-winning fantasy series, Rose played the role of the Kit character, John Snow's mistress, Grit.
The couple married in June 2018 on the grounds of a family estate in Lesley, Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: New cases in China increased by 14%
China has declared a 14% increase in its HIV and AIDS population.
Health officials said that more than 8,20,000 people in the country are infected.
In the second quarter of 2018 alone, there were about 40,000 new cases.
Most of the people in the new cases were sexually transmitted, which reflects changes in the past.
Traditionally, HIV spread rapidly in parts of China due to contaminated blood.
But this has reduced the number of people infected with HIV to almost zero, Chinese health officials told a conference in Yunnan Province.
However, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China increased by 1,00,000 per annum.
HIV transmission through sex is a major problem in China's LGBT community.
Although homosexuality has not been a crime in China since 1997, discrimination against LGBT people has increased everywhere.
The study findings suggest that, due to the country's conservative values, an estimated 70-90% of men who have sex with men eventually marry women.
Inadequate protection in such relationships causes most infections.
Since 2003, as part of its efforts to address the problem, the Chinese government has pledged global availability of HIV medicines.
Maxine Waters denied that the employee leaked GOP Senator data and called it "dangerous falsehood" and "conspiracy theory".
U.S. Republican Magazine Waters on Saturday condemned allegations that one of its employees posted personal information of three Republican U.S. senators on the legislature's Wikipedia pages.
The Los Angeles Democrat insisted that the claims were made by "right-wing" scholars and websites.
"Lies, lies, and more hateful lies", Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The published information allegedly included the residence addresses and phone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch of Utah.
The information posted by an anonymous ISM on Capitol Hill during the Senate panel hearing on sexual abuse allegations against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kwanyu was seen online on Thursday.
After the three senators checked the vault, it was leaked.
Conservative sites such as Gateway Pandit and Redstat reported that the IP address identifying the source of the post was associated with Waters' office and that one of Waters' employees had leaked the information, The Hill reported.
"These baseless allegations are completely false and utterly false", Waters continued.
"My staff member - whose identity, personal information and security have been compromised by these fraudulent and false allegations - is not responsible for any way of leaking this information.
These baseless accusations are completely false and boldly false".
Waters' statement was immediately criticized online by former White House press secretary Ari Flasher.
"It is disgusting to deny it", writes Fletcher.
"It shows that her temperament is not worthy of being a member of Congress.
When someone is accused of something they did not do, they do not have reason to be angry.
They should not be distracted.
They do not want to question the intentions of the accuser.
They must be calm and content".
Fletcher Waters' reaction was compared to the criticism of the Democrats' judge Kavanaugh, who was accused by critics of being very angry during Thursday's hearing.
Republican candidate Omar Navarro, who will be contesting Waters in the midterm elections, also expressed his thoughts on Twitter.
"It's a big deal if it's true", he tweeted.
In his statement, Waters said that his office "has informed the appropriate authorities and law enforcement agencies about these fraudulent claims.
"We will ensure that criminals are exposed", he added, "and they will be held legally responsible for any and all acts that are destructive and dangerous to any or all of my staff".
John English Strikes Again Review - The less effective spy irony of Rowan Atkinson
It is now a tradition for any new film to see the effects of Brexit in the British fashion, and this applies to the Johnny English action-comedy irony franchise - which began as Johnny English in 2003 and came to life as Johnny English Reborn in 2011.
Will there be a happy self-deprecation about how worthless we are as a new export opportunity for the country?
In any case, the disfigured Johnny English has his license to shoot things renewed for a second time - his name suggests that he has a huge comic creation design for non-English cinema audiences.
He's definitely a silly secret agent who, despite his own glamorous pretense of being a little bit like Mr. Bean, looks like a clown, and that guy's gang contributes a note to the tune of the 2012 London Olympics opening ceremony, Charities of Fire.
The character is based on the traveler and mysterious international man who Atkinson once played in the now-forgotten Barclays TV commercials, adding to his confusion.
This latest JE film also has a couple of good moments.
I loved the scene of John English walking to the helicopter in medieval armor and the wings of the wingman slamming against his head.
Atkins's contribution to physical humor is apparent, but humor is far less effective and especially "serious" movie brands like 007 and Mission Impossible seem strangely unnecessary in the context of trustingly incorporating humor as an element.
The joke seems to be designed for young children, not adults, and I didn't find Johnny English's bizarre accident as imaginative and focused as Atkinson's Bean-shaped silent film jokes.
The general premise of the matter is that Great Britain is in serious trouble.
A cyber-hacker breaks into Britain's super-secret web network of intelligence agents to reveal the identities of all UK work agents, which surprises the work agent - a very small role for Kevin Alden.
A fierce and rebellious and already declining political figure, Pantpradhan has the last hope: Emma Thompson has played a very good role in the story, but she has little to do with the story.
Her intelligence consultant advises her that she must bring someone retired to her as every active spy is exposed.
And that means that stupid Johnny English, who is currently working as a school teacher in a luxury colony, teaching off-the-grid lessons on how to become an intelligence operative: Here are some great funny moments because English makes a school a rock-type spy academy.
English is summoned again for an emergency briefing at the White House in a flash, and is again reunited with his longtime colleague, Bo, played by Bell Miller.
Bo is now married, married to a submarine commander, a Jolly-Hockey-Sticks role that has usurped the potential of an artist like Vicky Pepperdine.
Every Magisterial secret service is filled with terrible mistakes made by Batman and Robin, who face off against Olga Kurilenko's beautiful, deadly wife, Ophelia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister is being dangerously influenced by a tech millionaire who claims to solve Britain's computer problems: the terrible Jason Volta, played by Jake Lassie.
English and Bo embark on their ridiculously fun journey: in a waitress's dress, they set fire to a quirky French restaurant; they embarrass themselves smuggling out of Volta's luxurious yacht; and English throws himself into chaos by trying to put on a virtual reality headset to familiarize himself with the interior of Volta's house.
All the events have been pulled up and down for the final episode, but the way it's funny and riotous, it sounds like a children's TV show.
Very good material.
And like other Johnny English films, I thought, "Couldn't the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role to play?"
The Labour Party has rejected the British plan to work four days a week and pay five days a week.
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party says the British are considering a radical scheme to work four days a week and pay five days a week.
The party allegedly believes that the money saved by the AI revolution by the company owners should be paid to employees by giving them an extra day off.
This will give employees three days on weekends but will not reduce wages.
According to the sources, this idea is 'sticking' in the economic themes and policies of the Party to bend the country to the interests of the employees.
The Trades Union Congress rewarded the four-day week as a way for employees to take advantage of a changing economy.
A senior Labour Party source told The Sunday Times: 'Political changes are expected to be announced by the end of this year.
'This will not happen overnight but the four-day work week is an aspiration that is aligned with the Party's vision of restoring the economy for the benefit of the workers and the overall industrial policy of the Party.'
The Green Party had promised a four-day work week in their 2017 general election campaign.
However, this aspiration has not been fully rewarded by the Labour Party.
A Labour Party spokesman said: 'The four-day work week is not the policy of the party, it is not the idea of the party.'
Former Finance Minister John MacDonnell used last week's Labour Conference to explain his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy in more detail.
Mr. McDonnell said he was determined to take power from the 'faceless directors' of the service institutions and the 'no-faulters' of the utilities.
The per finance scheme also means that the current investors in water institutions cannot get their full return on their investment because the Labour government can 'justify' the misconduct seen there.
He also underlined the plans to recruit workers to the boards of directors of the company and to create a comprehensive ownership fund to fund 10 per cent of the shares of private sector organisations to employees eligible for annual dividends of up to £500.
Lyndsey Graham, John Kennedy, tells "60 Minutes" about whether the FBI's investigation into Kavanaugh has changed our views.
The FBI's investigation into the allegations against Justice Brett Khanu has delayed the final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court for at least a week, and the Bureau's findings have raised questions about whether any Republican Party member could be hesitant to withdraw his support.
In an interview broadcast on Sunday, "60 Minutes" journalist Scott Pelly asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsay Graham if the FBI could find anything that could change their views.
Kennedy spoke more openly than his colleague in South Carolina.
"Yes, of course", Kennedy said.
"I have been to the hearing and I have spoken to Justice Khanu.
And then I called them and I said, "Why did you do this?"
He was bold, firm, and unshakable".
Graham's opinion, however, seemed to be settled.
"I have made a decision about Brett Kavanaugh, and only a big charge can change it", he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I do know this: Brett has denied the accusation with all his might", Graham Christin continued, referring to Blasey Ford.
"And not everyone she called by her name could have ignored it.
It's 36 years old.
I don't think there's going to be any change".
What is the Global Citizens' Festival and has it done anything to eradicate poverty?
The Global Citizens Festival, an annual music festival in New York City, will be held next Saturday, with some of the biggest stars in the world, and the goal is equally as big: eradicating global poverty.
In this seventh year of the Global Citizens Festival, tens of millions of people will gather on the Great Lawn of Central Park not only to enjoy the art of artists like Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Sean Mendes but also to spread the true purpose of the festival, which aims to end the world's pitiful poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizens Festival, which started in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international advocacy group that hopes to increase the number of people striving to eradicate poverty.
To get free admission to the event (if you don't want to buy VIP admission), the event audience had to perform a whole series of tasks or "actions", such as volunteering to promote their global eradication goal, emailing a global leader, calling or adopting any other meaningful path.
But how successful has Global Citizens been with 12 years left to achieve its goals?
The idea of hosting a free concert for the public is that there is an honest way to get people to act, or just another form of so-called "clicktivism" - that people think that signing an online petition or tweeting really makes a difference?
Global Citizen says that since 2011 they have had records of more than 19 million "acts" by their supporters for different purposes.
He said their actions have helped to persuade world leaders to announce promises and policies for funding of $3.7 trillion or more, which will affect more than 225 crore people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the Group reported 390 promises and announcements resulting from its activities, of which at least $1 trillion has already been distributed or raised.
The group estimates that the funds available have directly affected the lives of nearly 649 million people worldwide so far.
Power of Nutrition is a partnership of investors and organisers in the UK that "helps young children to thrive to their full potential" and has pledged $35 million to the country to end malnutrition in Rwanda, after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from citizens around the world.
With the help of the UK Government, donors, national governments and global citizens like you, we can make the social injustice of low nutrition a cornerstone of history", said Tracey Ulman, Power of Nutrition's Ambassador, in a concert in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5000 actions to improve the nutrition of mothers and children in the UK, the Government has announced funding for the Power of Nutrition project, which will reach 50 lakh women and children with nutrition assistance.
One of the most frequently asked questions on their website is "Why do you think we can eradicate extreme poverty?"
Global Citizen said: "It's going to be a big, tough road - sometimes we fall and fail.
But, like our previous general rights and anti-racism movements, we will succeed because our strength has been strengthened by coming together.
Janet Jackson, The Weekend, Sean Mendes, Cardi B, Janel Monet are among the few performers to perform at this year's New York Festival, which will be inaugurated by Deborah-Lee Fernes and Hugh Jackman.
US Navy could be used to block Russian energy exports - Interim Secretary
U.S. Secretary of State for International Affairs Ryan Zink has made clear that Washington will use the Navy "if necessary" to prevent Russian energy from reaching other markets, including the Middle East, the Washington Examiner said.
Zink has alleged that Russia's involvement in Syria - especially where Russia is working at the invitation of its legitimate government - is an excuse to find new energy markets.
"They're in the Middle East because I think they want to be an energy broker like Eastern Europe, like the southern part of Europe", Zink reportedly said.
And according to officials, these are ways and means of handling it.
"The United States Navy has the ability to blockade if necessary, as well as to ensure that the sea lanes remain open to ensure that their energy does not reach the market", he said.
He was speaking to a panel of attendees at an event organized by the Zinc Consumer Energy Alliance, a nonprofit group that describes itself as the "voice of energy consumers" in the US.
He compared Washington's roles in Russia and Iran transactions and noted that they were effectively the same.
"The only viable option to profit from fuels and use replacement fuels is to a lesser extent to Iran and Russia", he said, calling Russia a "One Trick Pony" and saying that Russia's economy relies on livelihoods.
The announcements came as the Trump administration sought to replace Russia, a cheaper alternative to European consumers, by increasing its exports of liquefied natural gas to Europe.
Accordingly, officials in the Trump administration, including US President Donald Trump, are trying to persuade Germany to withdraw from the "inappropriate" Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which Trump says is a project that has "occupied" Berlin by Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the $1100 million Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which will double the current pipeline capacity to 11000 cubic meters, is a fully cost-effective project.
The Kremlin argues that Washington's opposition to the project is purely economic and is an example of unfair competition.
"Energy cannot be a tool for pressure and I think it is our common opinion that consumers should be able to choose suppliers", Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said after a meeting with US Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The US's intentions have been severely criticised by Germany, which has expressed its commitment to the project.
The Federation of German Industries (BDI), Germany's leading industrial organization, has asked the US to withdraw from EU energy policy and the bilateral agreement in Berlin and Moscow.
"It is a big question for me when our energy supply is interfered with by a third country", said Dietter Kemp, head of the Federation of German Industries (BDI), after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
The Massachusetts lawmaker said that Elizabeth Warren will "pay close attention" to the 2020 presidential election.
Massachusetts Rep. Elizabeth Warren said Saturday that she would "pay close attention" to the upcoming presidential election after the midterm elections.
Warren, speaking at the Town Hall in Holyoke, Massachusetts, stressed that he would consider running for office.
"Now is the time for women to go to Washington and take over their collapsed government, and that includes the act of a woman taking the top job", The Hill said.
"After November 6, I will be closely watching the presidential election".
Warren argued with Trump at Town Hall, saying President Donald Trump was "leading the county in the wrong direction".
"I am deeply concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy", he said.
Warren has been making clear statements about Trump and Kavanaugh, who he nominated to the Supreme Court.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said, "You definitely need an FBI investigation before the vote".
However, a survey released on Thursday found that the majority of people in Warren's own constituency do not think they should contest the 2020 presidential election.
According to the Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe Poll, 18 percent of "potential" Massachusetts voters said Warren should not run for office.
Thirty-three percent of the people supported such an election.
The poll, which tracks voter trends, found that former Governor Devlal Patrick received 38 percent support for the upcoming election and 48 percent opposition.
Other key Democratic names discussed in the context of the potential 2020 election included Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont MP Bernie Sanders.
According to Associated Press reports, Biden has said that the official decision will be made by January.
Sarah Palin gave an example of PTSD by Track Palin at a meeting with Donald Trump.
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after being drafted in September.
He was arrested on Monday night and charged with domestic violence.
"Seeing what my baby boy is going through, what he is coming back through, I can understand the injuries of other families and our soldiers who are suffering from the unfortunate consequences of PTSD and the injuries they are returning to", he told a crowd at a meeting of Donald Trump in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Paulin called the detention "a prison elephant", and said of his son and other soldiers, "When they come back, they are a little different, they come back bitter, they come back thinking about whether their soldiers and the respect that every Airman and member of the military has for the country is there".
According to Dan Bennett, spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department, Track Palin was arrested in Wasilla, Alaska on Monday and charged with domestic violence against a woman by interfering with reports of domestic violence and possession of a weapon while intoxicated.
18 States, D.C. support the challenge of the new Asura Policy.
The legal challenge to the new U.S. policy of denying asylum to victims fleeing gang or domestic violence has been supported by 18 states and the District of Columbia.
Representatives from 18 states and the District of Columbia filed a friend-of-the-court brief in Washington on Friday in support of an asylum seeker who opposes the policy, NBC News reported.
The full name of the plaintiff in Grace V. was not disclosed regarding the hearing the American Civil Liberties Union filed in August against federal policy.
She said that her partner "and the children of his violent gang member" abused her but U.S. officials denied her request for asylum on July 20.
She was banned in Texas.
Lawyers who supported Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala as countries facing a problem of gang and domestic violence, where the number of U.S. asylum seekers is very high.
The new U.S. asylum policy has reversed a decision by the Board of Immigrant Appeals in 2014 that allowed undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
In a statement Friday, District of Columbia Attorney General Carl Rezin said the new policy "ignores decades of state, federal and international law".
"All claims for redress under federal law must be judged according to the specific facts and circumstances of the claim and such prohibitions violate those rules", the Friend-of-the-Court brief said.
In a briefing, lawyers argued that denial of entry to immigrants is damaging the U.S. economy, saying immigrants are more likely to become professionals and "provide essential labor".
Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration-related judges in June to no longer allow refugees to escape domestic violence and gang violence.
"There is a shelter for people who leave their homeland due to fear or persecution because of their religion, religion, nationality or membership of a particular social group or political ideology", Sessions said in a statement on the policy on June 11.
It was never expected that all the problems that people around the world face every day -- even all the serious problems -- would be solved by looking forward.
The number of deaths in the search for the living has doubled.
The situation for the living was becoming more and more dire.
"I am feeling very stressed", said 35-year-old mother, Risa Kusuma, who was waving to her hot-blooded son in the burned-out city of Palo.
"Every minute an ambulance brings a body.
There is a misfortune of clean water".
Residents were seen picking up their waterlogged belongings, trying to save whatever they could find, returning to their destroyed homes.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals were filled with the damaged by the 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
Some of the injured, including a broken back and shoulder, were resting outside the Palau Army Hospital, where patients were being treated outside due to persistent severe back pain.
His eyes filled when he remembered the powerful earthquake shaking the fifth floor of the hotel room where he lived with his wife and daughter.
"There was no time to save yourself.
I think I was crushed under the mud", Harris told the Associated Press, adding that his family had been to the wedding in town.
"I heard my wife scream for help, but then she calmed down.
I don't know what happened to her and my daughter.
I hope they are safe".
US Ambassador accuses China of 'inciting subversion' through 'voting ads'
A week after an official Chinese newspaper published a four-page ad in a U.S. daily that described the mutual benefits of U.S.-China trade, the U.S. ambassador to China has been accused of using the American press to spread propaganda in Beijing.
U.S. President Donald Trump last Wednesday accused China of interfering in the November 6 U.S. Congressional elections, citing a paid supply of the Chinese daily in Des Moines Register - Iowa's most expensive newspaper - which China rejected.
Trump's accusation that China tried to meddle in the US election is a new chapter in Washington's growing campaign to pressure China, US officials told Reuters.
While it is common for foreign governments to advertise to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently engaged in a growing trade war, which seems to be causing them to impose a heavy tax on each other's imports.
Chinese and American experts say that the response tariffs imposed by China at the beginning of the trade war were designed to influence exporters from states like Iowa who supported Trump's Republican Party.
Longtime governor of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural goods to China, U.S. Ambassador to China Terry Branstad said Beijing has hurt American workers, farmers and businesses.
In an article in the Des Moines Register on Sunday, Branstad writes, "China is now duplicating its propaganda in our own free journalism".
"To spread its propaganda, the Chinese government is taking advantage of America's long-standing tradition of free speech and free journalism by offering paid advertising in Des Moines", writes Branstad.
"In contrast, the lack of anti-sun signals in the Beijing streets is a real reflection of the Chinese people's differing opinions on China's problematic economic projections, because the media is under the strict control of the Communist Party of China", he writes.
He added that "a leading Chinese newspaper turned down an offer to publish his article", but he did not name the letter.
Analysts have warned that Republicans are polarizing female voters by defeating Cavanaugh in the midterm.
Analysts have warned that as many top Republicans have stood up and defended Supreme Court nominee Brett Cavanaugh on various sexual harassment charges, they will face a particularly heavy blow in the upcoming midterm elections.
The sentiment is very strong and the majority of Republicans are officially showing that they will vote on it.
Those things cannot be turned back", Grant Reehr, professor of political science at Maxwell College at Syracuse University, said in an article published Saturday in The Hill.
Reehr said that Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona) was skeptical that the proposal for an FBI investigation at the time would be enough to calm angry voters.
"Women will not forget yesterday - they will not forget tomorrow and they will not forget in November", said Karin Jean-Pierre, senior advisor to the progressive group MovOn and national spokeswoman, on Friday, according to the Washington, D.C. newspaper.
On Friday morning, protesters in Senate lobbying announced "November is coming!" after the Judiciary Committee-controlled Republicans supported Cavanaugh's nomination, despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blassy Ford, Mick reported.
"The enthusiasm and motivation of the Democrats is flowing", said Stu Rodenberg, a neutral political analyst, to the news site.
"People say it's already at the highest level; it's true.
But it can grow even further, especially for the volatile female voters in the suburbs, as well as young voters aged 18 to 29 who don't like the president, who don't usually vote".
Even before Ford's public evidence detailing her sexual harassment allegations against a Supreme Court nominee, analysts had suggested that Republicans could be hit if they agreed with confirmation.
"This is now a messy mess for GOP", former Republican National Committee chairman Michael Steel said earlier last week, NBC News reported.
"It's not just about the committee's vote or whether the final vote or whether Cavanaugh will be elected, it's also about how Republicans handled the case and how they treated her", Gay Cecil, director of the Priorities USA group that helped elect Democrats, told the News Channel.
However, in the wake of the testimony of Ford and Cavanaugh, there is a bit of a twist among Americans as to who to trust, with Cavanaugh's tendency to be a little more.
While 41 percent of respondents in a new poll by Yugve believe in a certain or probable testimony of Ford, 35 percent said they believe in a certain or probable Cavanaugh.
Also, 38 percent said that Cavanaugh definitely or potentially lied during the testimony, while only 30 percent said so in the case of Ford.
Following Flake's demand, the FBI is investigating allegations made by Ford as well as at least one other accuser, Deborah Ramirez, The Guardian reported.
Last week, Ford testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee that he was 17 years old when Cavanaugh assaulted him while intoxicated.
Ramirez alleged that a Supreme Court nominee revealed his gender to him at a party while studying at Yale in the 1980s.
The founders of the World Wide Web are planning to launch a new Internet to counter Google and Facebook.
World Wide Web inventor Tim Berners-Lee is launching a startup that will take on rivals Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of a well-known technologist, Inerpt, is a company that is based on the open source platform of Berners-Lee, Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where to store their data and which information to allow access to.
In a special interview with Fast Company, Burns-Lee Cott said that Inerpt's ultimate goal is to "dominate the world".
"We have to do this now", he said of the startup.
"This is a historic moment".
The app uses solid technology to allow people to create their own "personal online data storage" or POD.
It can include contact lists, to-do lists, calendars, music libraries and other personal and business tools.
It's like having Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify all in the same browser and at the same time.
The special thing about online personal data storage is that the user is entirely responsible for what kind of information someone handles.
The company calls it "personal capability through data".
According to the company's CEO, John Bruce, the idea behind Inerpt is to bring the resources, processes and skills to the company to provide a solid source of supply for everyone.
The company currently includes a security platform acquired from Berners-Lee, Bruce, IBM, a community of volunteer coders and a staff of some developers contracted to work on the project.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world will be able to create their own decentralized apps using the tools available on Inerpt's website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team "are not talking to Facebook and Google about whether or not they should make a complete change that will completely derail all their business models overnight".
"We do not ask their permission".
In a post on Medium published on Saturday, Berners-Lee writes that Invert's "goal is to provide business power and ecosystems to help maintain the integrity and quality of the new web built on solid".
In 1994, Berners-Lee revolutionized the Internet by founding the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has made an effective voice in the net neutrality debate.
Even with the launch of Invert, Berners-Lee will remain as the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, The Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I'm very optimistic about the next era of the Web", Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vaughn: World War I was celebrated by the Victoria Cross clergy.
Its origin ceremony was celebrated 100 years later in honour of the only Church of England priest to win the Victoria Cross as a soldier in World War I.
Lt. Col. The Reverend Bernard Vaughn won the prize at the Battle of Belenglis and the Battle of Leighcourt on 29 September 1918.
However, four days later he was shot dead by a soldier with a hidden brother and never realized he had received the highest honour of the British Army.
At a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire on Saturday, two of his grandchildren unveiled a statue erected in his memory.
One of his nephews, Michael Vaughn, said that the unveiling of the fountain 100 years after his grandfather's award-winning feat was "extremely symbolic.
According to the London Gazette, on 29 September 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Vaughan led the battalion through the Canal de Saint-Quentin "through the heavy fog and gunfire from the battlefield".
He then went to the firing line and led the line "very bravely" before defeating three detachments, fighting the cannons on the battlefield alone.
Lt. Col. Vaughan was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918 - about a month before the war ended.
Michael Vaughn, 72, said his grandfather's actions were "abominations that I could never do".
He and his brother Dr. James Vaughn also donated flowers after the parade led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vaughn said he "felt very honoured to take part in the parade" and added that "the support of so many people demonstrated the true courage of a hero".
MMA fans stayed up all night to watch the Belator 206, but instead they had to watch the Peppa Pig.
Imagine you woke up all night to watch a full-blown beater 206, but you were refused the main event.
The San Jose Bill had 13 matches, including six matches on the main card, and was scheduled to be shown live overnight on Channel 5 in the UK.
At 6am, while Gerard Moosey and Rory McDonald were preparing to face each other, they shocked the UK audience by broadcasting Peppa Pig instead of showing its coverage.
Some who woke up early in the morning to fight were especially disappointed.
One fan wrote on Twitter about the cartoons of children as "a kind of cruel joke".
Asked about the broadcast, "they had to put in a children's program because the content was not broadcast at 6am by government regulations", said Dave Schwartz, senior vice president of marketing and communications at Belator.
"Pappa the Pig, yes".
Billetter Chairman Scott Cocker said they would revise their schedule to accommodate UK audiences in the future.
"I think when I thought about replay, I thought we could do it", said Cocker.
"But it was six o'clock in the morning on Sunday, and we couldn't do it until our Sunday, their Monday.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, there were a lot of messages coming and going after that change, and they weren't all friendly.
We were trying to solve it, we thought it was a technical problem.
But if it wasn't, it was a government case.
I can promise that this will not happen again.
We always have five fights instead of the six we have -- and we tried to give more to the fans, but we failed.
It was a tragic situation".
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daly felt "uncomfortable" with sex.
Olympic diver Tom Daley says he felt inferior to everyone else because of his sexuality - but that inspired him to succeed.
The 24-year-old Daily said, "Everyone's not like me", and I didn't realize that until I went to high school.
Speaking on the first Radio 4 Desert Island Discs presented by Lauren Laverne, he said he spoke about gay rights to provide "hope" to others.
He also said that being a parent has reduced his appreciation for winning the Olympics.
Curtie Young, a regular presenter of the long-running show, took several months off due to illness.
Attending Laverne's first event as an outcast, Daley said he grew up to be "lower" than everyone else because "loving boys and girls was not accepted by society".
He said: "To this day, the feeling of being short and being apart has been the key to my strength and strength to succeed".
He said he wanted to show them that I was "someone" so that when people actually knew about their sexuality, they wouldn't let them down.
A two-time Olympic bronze medalist, Daley became a high-profile LGBT campaigner and used his presence at this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to urge more countries not to criminalize homosexuality.
He said he spoke because he felt lucky enough to live freely without fear of being adversely affected by his actions and wanted to show others "hope".
The three-time world champion said the man -- whom he met in 2013, American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black -- "was amazing".
Daly married an Oscar winner 20 years older than him last year, but he said age difference was never a problem.
"When you've been through so much at such a young age" - he first participated in the Olympics at the age of 14 and his father died of cancer three years later - he said that it's hard to find someone of such a high age who has seen such ups and downs.
The couple became parents to Robert Ray Black-Daley in June, and Daley said that their "total approach" changed.
"If you had asked me last year, I would have said 'I want to win a gold medal,'" he said.
"You know, there are things more important than an Olympic gold medal.
Robby is my Olympic gold medal".
Their son was named Robert after his father, who died of brain cancer in 2011 at the age of 40.
Daly said that his father hadn't accepted that he was dying, and one of the last things he asked was if he had tickets to London 2012 - because he wanted to sit in the front row.
"I didn't dare tell them that you couldn't sit in the front row, Dad", he said.
"I was holding their hand when they breathed their last, and I wasn't sure they weren't invincible until their breath really stopped and they died", he said.
The following year, Daly competed in the 2012 Olympics and won a bronze medal.
"I knew that there could be no higher feeling than the dream I had had all my life - diving in the Olympic Games in front of a home audience", he said.
It was also the inspiration for his first song - Proud by Heather Small - which he combines with in preparation for the Olympics and still holds a fork on his limb.

Michaelson, who is not in form, was taken as an extra player for the Ryder Cup.
American Phil Michaelson will set a new record when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup match on Sunday, but he will have to get back in shape to avoid this milestone becoming a painful one.
Michaelson, playing in the biennial event 12 times in a row, is being replaced by captain Jim Furick as an extra player for the Saturday Foursquares and Forwards.
Instead of actually participating in the game, as he always does for the United States, this five-time major winner split his day into focusing on the game in the hope of promoting and eliminating the factors that were causing his game to deteriorate.
Even at the height of his career, the 48-year-old Michaelson, who has never been the most straightforward driver, is not ideal for a disciplined Lee Golf National course where the long, high end never forgives the wrong shot.
And if the course itself isn't as challenging, Michaelson will face the exact British Open winner Francisco Molinari in Sunday's ninth match, who has teamed up with rookie Tommy Fleetwood to win all four matches this week.
If the Americans start 12 singles games with four points behind, if they don't get a good start, the Michaelson game could be very important.
Furyk showed confidence in his player, and he could not say anything more.
"He fully understands his role today, he grabs my back and puts his hand around my neck and says he'll be ready tomorrow", said Furyk.
"He has a lot of confidence.
He's a Hall of Fame player and he's given these teams a lot before and this week.
I probably never imagined he would play two games.
I had imagined more, but I decided to do it, and I think that's the way we should go.
He wants to be there, just like everyone else".
Michaelson will break Nick Faldo's record for most Ryder Cup matches played on Sunday.
Perhaps this will be the end of his Ryder Cup career, which will never match the height of his personal bests.
Michaelson won 18, lost 20 and drawn seven, Furyk said his presence gave the team an abstract value.
"He's funny, he's sarcastic, he's funny, he likes to make people laugh and he's a great guy to be with", he explained.
"He will be a great time for young players, and this week, something they'll love to see.
He gives more than just games".
Captain Thomas Bourne of Europe knows that the great front may soon disappear.
European captain Thomas Bourne knows from his experience that a sufficient lead before a single match in the Ryder Cup on the final day can easily turn into an uncomfortable ride.
Dan made his debut in 1997 against Valdera, when a team led by Siv Ballesteror took a five-fold lead over the Americans but were exhausted when the match ended and won by only 141⁄2-131⁄2 short margin.
"You keep reminding yourself that we had a big lead at Valderama; we had a big lead at Brooklyn, where we lost, and we won at Valderama, but with only a small difference", Bourne said as he watched the class win 5-3 on both Friday and yesterday of 2018 leading to a 10-6 lead at Lee Golf National.
History will show me and everyone on that team that it's not over.
You'll have to do a full demolition tomorrow.
Go out there and do all the amazing things.
It's not over until you score on the board.
Our goal is to win the trophy and that's what we'll be focusing on.
I've told you everything, I'm focusing on the 12 players on our side, but we know who's on the other side of us -- the greatest player in the world".
Pleased with the performance of his players on the difficult golf course, Bourne adds: "I can never get ahead of myself in this.
Tomorrow's challenge is different.
Tomorrow, there's a personal exhibition coming up, and doing that is a different thing.
It's great to play with a partner when everything is going well, but when you go out there alone, you're going to have to test your abilities as a golfer.
This is the message you have to give to the players that they will do their best tomorrow.
Now, you leave your partner behind and he wants to do his best".
Unlike Bourne, the rival Furyk will focus on performing better than his players' combined performances, with the exception of Jordan Speeth and Justin Thomas who scored three of four points.
Furyk himself turned Europe around by doing the "miracle of the day", before that defeat, as part of the winning team on both sides of that big last-day turnaround.
In 1999, Captain Crenshaw asked his players how they progressed on their final day, and they replied, "I remember every word of it".
"We have 12 big games tomorrow, but you have to start fast, as you saw in Brooklyn, as you saw in Medina.
When he moves in one direction, he puts a lot of pressure on the midfield.
We'll set our lineup up accordingly and put our players on this lineup tomorrow as if we were going to do something magical".
Thomas was sent on a performance to try to fight back and he had to face Rory McLeary in the top match, followed by Paul Casey, Justin Rose, John Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood who were halfway up the other Europeans.
"I put these players in this order because I thought they would cover all sides", Bourne said, speaking of his single choices.
The new German warship was again postponed.
The latest German Navy warship was supposed to be commissioned in 2014 to replace the Cold War warships, but due to poor systems and rising costs, it will not be delivered until at least next year, local media reported.
According to a military spokesperson, the launch of the Baden-Whittenberg-class battleship, the Rhaeland-Phage, has now been postponed to the first six months of 2019.
The ship was scheduled to enter the Navy in 2014, but the future of the ambitious project was delayed due to concerns about post-delivery issues.
Four Baden-Whittenburg-class ships ordered by the Navy in 2007 will arrive to replace the Bremen-class battleship.
It is understood to have a powerful cannon, an anti-aircraft squadron and an anti-ship missile, as well as some hidden technologies such as radar, infrared and acoustic signature.
Other important features include a long maintenance period - the latest combat craft should be able to be deployed away from home ports for up to two years.
However, the continuing delay would mean that the modern warship - which allowed Germany to exhibit its power at sea - would be outdated by the time it entered service, Die Zeit reported.
The unfortunate F125 battle failure came to the fore last year, when German naval officials refused to commission the ship and returned it to the Lom and Foss shipyard in Hamburg.
For the first time, the Navy returned the ship to the shipbuilding company after delivery.
Not much information was given about the reasons for the return, but German media reported that there were several significant "software and hardware defects" and that they made the warship unsuitable for deployment on warfare missions.
The software shortages were particularly significant, as the Baden-Whittenberg-class ships would be operated by 120 sailors - half the manpower of the old Bremen-class combat hulls.
It also revealed that the boat is too heavy to perform and will not be able to upgrade the fleet in the future.
The 7,000-ton Rhyland-Phase is believed to be twice the weight of the similar class of ships used by Germany in World War II.
Along with the faulty hardware, the cost of the entire project - including the training of the crew - has also been a problem.
It has gone from the initial €2.2 billion - to an astonishing €3.1 billion ($3.6 billion).
The problems of the latest battlefields are of particular importance in the wake of the warning that the German Navy is declining in strength.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German parliament's defence committee, admitted that the Navy was really "deployable boats running out".
The official said the problem is growing rapidly as time goes on as old ships are dismantled, but no new ships have replaced them.
He regretted that no Baden-Whittenberg-class battleships were capable of joining the Navy.
National Trustees have been stealing information about the secret lives of the vagrants.
New research has been conducted in the Scottish Highlands to reveal how the wolves use the land to search for food.
It is hoped that the new findings will shed new light on the behaviour of unique flying mammals and help guide future conservation work.
A study by researchers from the National Trust of Scotland will trace the common and soprano pipistrellas as well as the brown long-eared and cobenton woolly frogs to Inverview Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special sound printers will be placed at strategic locations on the property to monitor the activity of the weeds throughout the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct mobile surveys using head-dead detectors.
The sound analysis of all sound recordings will determine the frequency of the call of the parrots and what species they are doing.
A map and report of natural habitat will be created to provide a comprehensive picture of their behaviour on a land-scale.
NTS's nature conservation adviser, Rob Dever, hopes the results will reveal which areas of natural habitat are important for the hermits and how each species uses it.
This information will help determine how best to maintain forest land for the production of grain and other related species for the management of natural habitat.
In the last century, the number of vagrants in Scotland and the UK has declined significantly.
They are at risk due to the loss of habitat and natural habitat affected by construction and development works.
Wind turbines and lighting also pose a risk, as do some chemical processes of flypapers and building materials, as well as attacks by pet cats.
Whales are not actually blind.
However, their nocturnal hunting habits make their ears more useful for catching prey than their eyes.
They use state-of-the-art eco-location techniques to track insects and their pathways.
NTS, which is responsible for the care of 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land across the country, has taken the woods very seriously.
They have ten trained specialists who regularly survey, inspect the settlements and sometimes also perform rescue work.
The organisation set up Scotland's first and only remaining wetland reserve at the Three Estates at Dumfries and Galloway, which is home to eight of Scotland's ten species.
David Thompson, the estate's manager, said that the estate is an ideal territory for them.
"There is a great area for the weaselers in Thrive", he said.
"We have old buildings, lots of old trees and all good natural accommodation.
But there are many things about the wolf that we still don't know, so what we're doing here and on other properties will help us better understand what we need to get them".
They stress the need to inspect the wombs before maintaining the property as they can cause the unknown destruction of a single maternity home, causing the death of 400 females and babies, and potentially threatening the entire local population.
Orphans are protected and it is a crime under the law to kill, torture or harass them or destroy their habitat.
Elizabeth Farrell, Scottish Officer of the Wool Conservation Trust, encouraged people to help.
He said: "We want to learn a lot about our insects because we don't know what the population status of many of our species is".
Ronaldo denied the rape charges and lawyers prepared to file a lawsuit against the German magazine.
Cristiano Ronaldo has touted the rape allegations against him as "fake news", saying people use his name to "promote them".
His lawyers prepared to file a lawsuit against the German news magazine Der Spiegel, which published the charges.
A US woman named Catherine Mayorca, from Portugal and Juventus Forward, is accused of raping her in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
Der Spiegel reported on Friday that he was charged with $375,000 for keeping her quiet about the incident.
Speaking to his 142 million followers via Instagram live video hours after the claim, 33-year-old Ronaldo promises the claim is "fake news".
"No, no, no, no, no, no.
What he said today is fake news", said the five-time Ballon d'Or winner speaking in front of the camera.
"They want to make themselves known by my name.
It's normal.
They're trying to make a name for themselves by taking my name, but that's part of the job.
I am a happy man and everything is fine", the player continued with a smile.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel for the charges, which they say are "an unacceptable exposé of private-sector suspicion".
Lawyer Kristin Schertz said that the player "may claim compensation equivalent to the scope for the violation of moral damage, which is possibly one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent times".
The alleged incident occurred in June 2009 in a suite at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
According to documents filed in Clark County District Court in Nevada, after meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorca allegedly returned to the player's room, where he raped her ass.
Mayorta claimed that after the alleged incident, Ronaldo knelt down and told her that he was "99 percent" a "good man" and "one percent" disappointed him.
The documents claim that Ronaldo admitted to having sex, but said it was by mutual consent.
Mayorka also claimed that she had gone to the police and had photos of her injuries taken in the hospital, but then agreed to settle out of court because she felt "dumb" and worried about being "publicly humiliated".
34-year-old Mayorka says that she is now settling the case because she is still irritated by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was preparing to join Real Madrid from Manchester United when the alleged attack took place, and this summer went to the Italian giant Juventus for a €100 million deal.
Brexit: UK will have a permanent regret for the businessmen's failure
UK Secretary of Commerce Greg Clark said that if the UK had to deal with the status of a global leader in car manufacturing after Brexit, it would "continue to regret it forever".
He added that the "concern" was that Toyota UK told the BBC that if Britain left the EU without a deal, they would temporarily halt production at their factory in Bernston near Derby.
"We need a deal", Mr. Clark said.
A Japanese manufacturer said that a no-deal Brexit could lead to job losses due to border delays.
The Bernston Plant - where Toyota's Oris and Avensis were manufactured - produced nearly 1,50,000 cars last year, with the remaining 90% exported to the European Union.
"I think if Britain leaves the EU by the end of March we will see production at our factory shut down", said Marvin Cook, Toyota's managing director at Bernston.
Other UK carmakers including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover expressed concern about how cross-border trade would work if they left the EU without a deal.
For example, BMW says they will close their mini-plant in Oxford a month after Brexit.
The main concern of manufacturers is that no deal Brexit will jeopardize the supply chain.
Toyota's production line operates on the principle of "even on time", where spare parts are delivered every 37 minutes from suppliers in the UK and EU for cars made on demand.
If the UK leaves the EU without any deal before 29 March, there could be a border disruption, and industry claims that the spare parts could be delayed and reduced.
It would be impossible for Toyota to hold stock for more than a day at its Derbyshire plant, and the company said that would result in production shutdown.
Mr. Clark said that Theresa May's Checker's plan for future relations with the EU is being carefully modified to avoid checks at the border.
"We need to complete a deal. We want a deal that is the best, as I said that for now we not only want to be happy with making it a success, but we also want to take advantage of this opportunity", he said on the BBC 4 programme today.
This is not only proven by Toyota but also by other manufacturers for whom we need to maintain this story, which will ensure a very successful supply chain.
Toyota did not say how long production would be halted, but in the long run, it warned that increased costs would reduce the competitiveness of the factory and, of course, affect jobs.
Peter Suvallaris, who worked at Barnstone for 24 years and is a United Union conveyor at the plant, said that his members are very concerned: "In my experience once they lost their jobs they will never come back.
A government spokesperson said: "We have put forward a precise and reliable plan for our future relationship with the EU.
The White House said Trump's meeting with Rosenstein could be postponed again.
The White House said on Sunday that a high-level meeting with Donald Trump's deputy attorney general, Rod Rosenstein, could be postponed for another week as the Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh is being debated.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Special Counsel Robert Mueller, which includes investigating Russian election interference, Trump's links with allies and Russia, and possible obstruction of justice by the president.
Rumors have been circulating in Washington for months that Trump will show or not show the way out, threatening Mueller's freedom.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein wired a recording of a conversation with Trump, which would have removed the president by the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein rejected this view.
But last Monday, he went to the White House and there was talk of his resignation.
Instead, a meeting with Trump at the United Nations in New York was announced on Thursday.
Trump said he would not like Rosenstein removed, but the meeting was postponed to avoid a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing, which would see Kavanaugh and Dr. Christine Blassy Ford, one of the women accused of sexual abuse, testify.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week-long FBI investigation into claims against Khanu, further prolonging the entire Senate vote.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, was present at Fox News Sunday.
When asked about Rosenstein's meeting, he said: "He has no date, it could be this week, I think it could be postponed another week considering other issues with the Supreme Court.
But, we'll see, and I always like to keep the press informed.
Some journalists argued that Sanders had not reported to the White House press since September 10.
The organizer, Chris Wallace, asked why.
Sanders said there was no animosity towards the TV journalists' performance for the lack of publicity.
He later suggested that direct contact between Trump and the press would be increased.
"This president holds more Q&A sessions than any other president before him", he said, and then without providing any evidence, he said, "We've seen those numbers".
The press will continue to gossip, Sanders said, but if journalists had the opportunity to ask the president of the United States directly, he would be many times better off than talking to me.
We're doing our best to do that, and this is the first time in the last few weeks that you've done that, and when you talk to the president of the United States, he'll take the place of the press.
Trump regularly listens to questions when he leaves the White House or attends an open session or a press conference with visiting senior officials.
Press conferences alone are rare.
This week in New York, the president may have pointed out a reason for his carelessness and bizarre presentation to the press gathered.
The Health Secretary wrote to EU staff at NHS Scotland about the Brexit concerns.
The Secretary of Health wrote to the EU staff working in Scotland's NHS to express the country's gratitude and wish to remain post-Brexit.
Jean Freeman MSP sent a letter to the UK withdrawing from the EU less than six months after it was due.
The Scottish Government has been committed to covering the cost of permanent status applications for EU citizens working in the public services under its responsibility.
In her letter, Ms Freeman writes: "In the summer, negotiations on the UK's exit from the EU continued, with a decision expected in the autumn.
But the UK government is also preparing for a situation without a possible deal.
I know this must be a very uncomfortable time for all of you.
That is why I would like to reiterate that I value the contribution of every member of the working class, regardless of their nationality.
Colleagues from across the EU and beyond bring in invaluable skills and experience that strengthen and improve healthcare performance, and benefit the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is your home and we sincerely hope you will stay here.
Christian Abercrombie underwent emergency surgery after suffering a head injury.
Tennessee's Mike Organ said that Tennessee State Tigers linebacker Christian Abercrombie underwent emergency surgery after suffering a head injury in a 31-27 loss to Vanderbilt Commodores in Saturday's game.
Tennessee State head coach Rod Ridney told reporters he was injured just before the left half.
"He came to the side line and collapsed there", read the reader.
The coach and medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen on the sideline before putting him on the stretcher and taking him for further diagnosis.
A Tennessee State official told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee that Abercrombie had undergone surgery at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that the type or extent of the injury is still unknown and Tennessee State is trying to find out when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a second-year redshirt student, was playing his first season at Tennessee State after moving from Illinois.
He had taken a total of five tackles on Saturday before the current game, which was his 18th total tackle for the season.
More stamp duty will be charged on foreign buyers for purchasing properties in the UK.
More stamp duty will be charged to foreign buyers for purchasing properties in the UK and the additional money will be used for the homeless under the New Tory scheme.
This step will be a key step in Corbyn's successful campaign to attract young voters.
This stamp duty will be imposed on people who do not pay taxes in the UK.
The Treasury is expected to contribute up to 12 crore pounds per year to help the homeless.
Theresa May will announce today that there is a willingness to charge more stamp duty for purchases of property in the UK from foreign buyers, with the additional money raised going to help the homeless.
The move will be seen as an attempt to overcome the success of Jeremy Corbyn's campaign to attract young voters with a commitment to provide more affordable housing and target high-income people.
The increase in stamp duty will be imposed on non-taxable individuals and companies in the UK, and the additional money will boost the government's campaign to help those who sleep on the streets.
Surcharge  In addition to the high levels imposed on other houses two years ago, this will be accompanied by the present stamp duty and the purchase for rent can be up to three per cent expensive.
The Treasury is expected to raise up to £12 crore annually.
One estimate is that 13 per cent of newly built London properties are bought by non-UK nationals, which raises their prices and makes it harder for first time home buyers to step up to buy a home.
Many of the affluent areas of the country, especially the capital, have become slums due to foreign buyers, who spend most of their time outside the country.
The new policy was announced just weeks after the stamp duty cuts to help younger people buy their first home.
He accused the big construction companies of buying land but not using it to raise property prices, and he asked Mrs May to remove reservations on affordable housing to help relieve the decline in UK housing.
Mr. Corbin has announced a series of significant housing reforms proposed, including rental controls and an end to evictions without notice.
They also want to give more power to the councils to build new houses.
Mrs May said: "Last year I said that I would dedicate my Prime Ministership to restoring the dreams of the British people - every new generation - of a better life.
And that means getting back on the market for sluggish housing.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and make a living here.
However, it will not be as easy for non-UK residents and for overseas companies to buy homes as hardworking British residents.
For many people, the dream of owning a dream home is far from over, and the distrust of those who sleep on the streets is a reality.
Jack Ross: My ultimate goal is to become the manager of Scotland.
Sanderland owner Jack Ross said his ultimate goal is to become Scotland's manager one day.
Scott, 42, is enjoying the challenges of reviving the North-East club, and is three points behind the top spot, third in League One.
He has been at the Stadium of Light this summer, guiding St Mirren back to the Scottish Premiership last season.
I wanted to play for my country as a player.
I got a B-cap and I got just that", Ross told BBC Scotland's SportsSound.
But as a young boy, I grew up watching my father play Scotland in Hampden, and that's always been my passion.
That opportunity will only come when I succeed in managing the club.
Ross was preceded as manager of Sandherland by Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Allardise, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poet and Paulo de Canto.
The former owner of Alloa Athletic said he was not afraid to follow such established names in such big clubs when their offers were rejected by Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
At this point, my success will be measured by whether or not I will take this club to the Premier League.
Due to the structure and facilities of the club, it is undoubtedly eligible to join the Premier League.
It's not an easy task to take him there, but if I can get the club back there, I might just be able to see myself as a success.
After a 15-month period as an assistant manager at Dumbarton and a trainee at Hearts, Ross' managerial career has spanned just three years.
He later helped Alloa improve from relegation to the third tier and led Saint Mirren from the possibility of relegation later in the season to the Championship Cup.
And Ross says he's more than ever satisfied with his playing career at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St. Mirren and Hamilton Academic.
They remember that taking on the weight of aloo was probably actually square.
I really think management was more appropriate for me than playing.
It sounds weird because I played the right way, made the right way to live, and some of the way I enjoyed the top positions.
But it can be difficult to play.
You have to go through a lot of things every week.
I still go through stressful work situations today, but management is still right for me.
I always wanted to be a manager, and now I am, and I feel most satisfied that I have been working on my own personal preferences throughout my adult life.

According to the survey, the exact time of drinking is 5:30 pm on Saturday.
The summer heat has fueled the UK's booming pubs, but the pressure on restaurant chains has been increasing.
Pubs and bars grew by 2.7 per cent in July, while restaurants declined by 4.8 per cent.
Peter Martin of the CGA Business Advisory Centre who compiled the figures said: "The sunshine and England's longer-than-expected participation in the World Cup followed, which also meant that in July the pattern was repeated from the previous June, when, apart from the further shock of sitting down at restaurants, pubs were up 2.8 per cent.
The decline in restaurant business of 1.8 per cent in June further increased in July.
The pubs and bars that served more drinks than the restaurants were in the business were doing very well.
The pubs that served food, although not as dramatic as the restaurants, were also exposed to the sun.
It seemed that people just went out to drink.
Sales of beverages in well-managed pubs and bars increased by 6.6 per cent in the same month, while consumption of food decreased by 3 per cent.
Paul Newman, a relaxation and hospitality analyst at RSM, said: "We are seeing this as a trend that has been going on since late April.
When it comes to outdoor sales, the climate and important social or sporting events are the most effective factors.
It is not surprising that the restaurant groups struggle, although a decrease of 4.8 percent from the previous year will be particularly painful due to the current spending pressure.
The long hot summer should not have come at a time when it was a difficult time for food drivers and the moderate temperature we experienced in August can only tell us if it can provide much needed relief.
With the newly opened, the total sales growth in pubs and restaurants in July was 2.7 percent, reflecting a decline in brand roll-out.
The Copper Peach Tracker Industry, for the UK pub, bar and restaurant sector, which has a combined turnover of over £9 trillion and established industry benchmarks, monitors sales of 47 such driver groups and analyses their performance data by collecting data.
One in five kids has a secret social media account that he hid from his parents.
One in five children, some 11 years old, has a secret social media account, which he hid from his parents and teachers, the survey revealed.
A survey of 20,000 secondary school students has revealed an increase in fake Instagram pages.
The news has caused a lot of hype that it is posting sexual content.
Twenty percent of students say that their main account is to show to parents.
One in five children, some 11 years old, are creating social media accounts that they keep secret from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed that fake Instagram accounts are growing fast, a reference to the photo-sharing site Instagram.
The news has caused a lot of hype that it is posting sexual content.
Twenty percent of students say that their cleansed main accounts are for showing to parents, and they also have private accounts.
A mother came to the scene when she first asked her 13-year-old daughter on a secret site to rape her.
Research by the Council of Principals and Principals of Digital Awareness UK and Independent Schools (HMC) found that 40 per cent of 11- to 18-year-olds had two identities, and half of those admitted to maintaining a private account.
HMC Chief Mike Buchanan said: "It is very frustrating to see that all teenagers are so eager to create online places that their parents and teachers cannot find.
Ailidh Doyle will be the voice of the athletes on the Scottish Athletics Board.
Ailidh Doyle was elected to the Board of Scottish Athletics as a non-executive director at the Annual General Meeting of the Board of Directors.
Doyle is Scotland's most famous track and field athlete and President Ian Beatty described the move as a great opportunity for those running the sport to benefit from their extensive experience at international level over the past decade.
Ailidh is highly respected by the Scottish, UK and global athletic community and we are confident that bringing him on board will greatly benefit the athletes in Scotland, said BT.
Doyle said: "I am looking forward to being a voice for sports and I hope to be able to contribute and guide the sport in Scotland.
The American who won four of his Olympic gold medals in the 200 and 400 meters at the 1996 Games in Atlanta, has now become a regular BBC pundit, who was unable to walk after a transit ischemic attack.
He wrote on Twitter: "I was paralyzed a month ago.
I couldn't walk.
The doctor said that whether or not I would recover and how much would only be known by time.
It was exhausting, but I recovered completely, learned to walk again, and today I exercise agility!
Thank you for the encouraging messages!
Online polls have split over the advertisement for breast pumps that compared mothers to gays.
Online polls have been divided over an advertisement by a breast pump company comparing breastfeeding women to breastfeeding cows.
Launching what is believed to be the world's first silent breast pump, consumer tech company Alvini released a mocking music video ad showing new freedoms for breastfeeding mothers.
Four real mothers dance on the song's key in a room full of bitter cow: "Yes, I give milk, but you can't see my tails".
The chorus continues to sing: Pump the water, pump it, I'm feeding the babies, pump it, pump it, I'm breastfeeding my women.
However, the ad posted on the company's Facebook page has sparked controversy online.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of lions, the video received mixed reviews from viewers, who felt that the dairy industry was taking a very shallow approach.
Using cows to promote this product is a very poor decision.
Except that their baby is taken away from them within a few days of birth, they become pregnant and give birth to breastfeed like us, she wrote.
The Elvis breast pump fits neatly inside the breast bra.
Another commented: "It's naturally annoying for both mother and baby.
But yes, why don't they use them to promote breast pumps for mothers who are holding their babies?
Another wrote: "This is an unrelated ad.
Where others supported the ad, one woman admitted that the song was "funny".
I think this is a great idea.
If I had still been breastfeeding, I would have had one.
Pumping made me feel like a cow.
This is a bit of a crazy ad, but I think it's the right thing to do.

Another commented: "This is a funny ad for mothers who pump (usually in their workplace or bathroom) and feel like cows".
This is not a commercial that praises or speculates on the dairy industry.
At the end of the video, she reveals that a group of women were dancing with their braces fitted with pumps.
The concept behind this campaign is based on the perspective of many women who use breast pumps who feel like gays.
However, the elvi pump is completely quiet, has no wires or tubes and fits perfectly into the nursing bra, giving women freedom of movement, can pick up the children and even go outside during pumping.
Partner and ECD Anna Ballarin from Mother expressed her opinion: Elvi Pump is a revolutionary product, which needs to be launched in an open and stimulating manner.
We wanted to bring breast pumping and all its challenges to the light by bringing the similarity between breastfeeding women and dairy cows, by showing the amazing sense of freedom that new pumps are offering us, in an interesting and relevant way.
This is not the first time that Elvy Pump has been in the big news.
At a London fashion sale, for designer Marta Jakubovsky, a mother of two was seen catwalking with this product.
Hundreds of migrant children moved quietly to tent camps on the Texas border.
Although monthly border crossings remained relatively unchanged, the number of migrant children detained increased in part, as the Trump administration's strict language and policies made it difficult to keep children with sponsors.
Traditionally, most sponsors themselves are undocumented immigrants and, when they come forward to adopt a child, they are afraid to jeopardize their ability to sustain themselves in that country.
When the federal authority announced in June that potential sponsors and other adult members of their household would have to make their fingerprints, and that data would be passed on to immigration officials, the risk increased.
Last week, senior Immigration and Customs Enforcement official Matthew Albanes testified before Congress, saying that the agency arrested a few people who applied to sponsor unaccompanied minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had no prior criminal records.
About 80 per cent of people who are sponsors or household members of sponsors live illegally, and a large proportion of them are involved in criminal activities.
So we have started to follow these people", said Mr. Albanes.
To speed up the process of children, officials introduced new rules, according to shelter workers, some of them will have to appear in court within a month from the date of their detention, instead of the previous standard of 60 days.
Many will attend by video conference rather than personally to present their petitions for legal status before the Migration Judge.
Those who feel unfit for assistance will be expelled from the country immediately.
According to shelter workers and income reports from the system in recent months, the longer children are in custody, the more anxious or desperate they may become, leading to violent tendencies or attempts to flee.
Lawyers say that these problems are widespread in large facilities like Tornillo, where the large number of children there, the neglected children are found to be extremely struggling.
He added that the children being taken to Tents City are not given time to prepare emotionally or to say goodbye to their friends, which is an additional shock to the children who are already struggling.
Syria has asked the US, French and Turkish forces to leave the country immediately.
Addressing the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Ma'lem also said that even though the country is now in its eighth year of war, the Syrian surrenderers should return home.
Ma'aleem, who is also the Deputy Prime Minister, said that the foreign military forces on Syrian soil on the grounds of fighting terrorism are illegal, and will be treated fairly.
He told the meeting that they should leave the country immediately and without any conditions.
Maulaim stressed that the war on terrorism in Syria is now almost over, with 360,000 people killed since 2011, and millions displaced.
He said that Damascus will continue to wage the holy war until all Syrian terrorists and no foreign entity are cleared of the terrorist group.
There are more than 2,000 United States military units in Syria, mostly training and advising the Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs opposed to President Bashar al-Assad.
In this war-torn country, France has more than 1,000 troops on its soil.
On the question of surrenderers, Maulaem said that the situation was favorable for them to return, but he blamed some foreign countries for spreading unreasonable fear, which led the surrenderers to stay away.
We have appealed to the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate their return.
What should have been purely humanitarian, they are doing is politics.
The United States and the European Union have warned that Syria will not receive any reconstruction aid until a political agreement between Assad and the opposition is reached to end the war.
UN diplomats say the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a buffer zone in the last major rebel stronghold of Idlib has given journalists a chance ahead of political news.
The Russian-Turkish agreement has prevented a massive attack on the Russian-backed Syrian army's Senedura region, where 30 million people live.
However, Ma'oulam stressed that the agreement had a clearly defined deadline and expressed hope that the military action would target and root out the jihadists with combat on the Nusra Front linked to al-Qaeda.
UN Ambassador Stefan de Mistura hopes that the first meeting of a new committee of government and opposition members to draft a post-war scenario for Syria and pave the way for elections will be held soon.
Molemani set out the conditions for the involvement of the Syrian government in the committee, saying that the panel's work should be limited to the scope of the current constitutional regulations and warned against any interference in them.
Why Trump Will Win a Second Term
According to that argument, as many liberals would probably expect that the impeachment and unpleasant events would bring an early end to his presidency, if not, Mr. Trump would win re-election in 2020.
There is no doubt that the most dramatic presidential race to date will be the final one!
To date, there are no signs of viewer fatigue.
Since 2014, CNN's prime-time ratings have doubled to 1.05 million, while MSNBC's prime-time ratings have nearly tripled to 1.6 million.
According to Nelson, Fox News has an average of 2.4 million prime-time viewers, up from 1.7 million four years ago, and topped MSNBC's The Rachel Madows cable ratings, which was watched by 3.5 million viewers on Major News Nights.
"This is a fire that is drawing people into it, because it's not something we understand", said Neil Bear, director of ABC drama "Designated All", about a cabinet secretary who becomes president after the Capitol is destroyed in an attack.
For Neil Scowell, a famous comedy writer and author of Just the Funny Parts: And How Hard Truths About Sneaking into the Hollywood Boys' Club, a different theory was.
She recalls a trip to a cab in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told her that he would vote for Mr. Trump.
Why? She asked.
He said, "Because he makes me laugh", Ms. Scowell told me.
In this mess, entertainment is valuable.
Unlike anything else on TV, of course, the story coming out of Washington DC will determine the future of Raw V. Madness, whether immigrant families can be reunited and the health of the global economy.
Ignoring is a luxury that can only be afforded by privileged audiences.
And yet, it goes to your head even as an informed citizen, when you see a panel of experts arguing at six o'clock, including Bob Woodward using deep background for his book Fear, Paul Manafort's $15,000 Oystrich-Leather Bomber Jacket (a thick cloth with a Hubris, called by the Washington Post) and Stormy Daniel's Mr. Trump, an intimidating description of physiology.
I, for one, will never see Super Mario the same again.
Speaking about Trump's changing cast and the daily plot twists (compared to Kim Jong-un's praise of the NFL) as well as the changes in the plot, Brent Montego Mary, chief executive of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of Phon Stars, said, "Seeing a partial part of what they do, I think they're delivering something every night through a reality show".
You can't miss a single part, because it will leave you behind.
When I arrived at Mr. Flies' house this week, it was sunny outside his house on the north shore of Kauai and temperatures were 80 degrees, but he was recording CNN and watching MSNBC.
They couldn't move away from him, not from Brett Kavanaugh, who is prepared to face the Senate Judiciary Committee and the Supreme Court's future is uncertain.
"I remember when we were doing all that crazy show during the day and people were saying, 'Western culture is beginning to end,'" Mr. Fleiss told me.
I thought it was a joke, but it was true.

Out of the midterm elections, the house race is flooded with money.
No wonder Pennsylvania is seeing its 17th money flood, which is responsible for the congressional district re-election that saw two candidates in the race for the same seat.
It recently resurrected Democratic Republican Conor Lamb in suburban Pittsburgh district who won his seat from another district in a special election last spring.
Lamb was facing Republican Keith Rothfuss, the second candidate, who was currently representing the old Pennsylvania 12th District, which was largely occupied with the new 17th.
After the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old district was unconstitutionally unfairly built in favor of the Republicans, the maps were recreated.
The race for the new 17th started a campaign of economic confrontation between the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC) of the main party.
Lamb became a household name in Pennsylvania after a narrow marginal victory in the March special election for Pennsylvania's 18th Congressional District, which was widely viewed as a "must see" election.
The seat had been held by Republicans for more than a decade, and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
Political pundits gave the Democrats a slight leaning.
The US decided to punish El Salvador for supporting China, but the decision was later changed.
Diplomats noted that after a brief withdrawal from Washington, the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing.
Mr. Trump had a friendly meeting with President Juan Carlos Verella of Panama in June 2017 and until the Trump Organization management team partner was fired, he owned a hotel in Panama.
State Department officials recalled the US Chief of Diplomatic Missions over recent decisions by El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama not to recognize Taiwan, State Department spokesman Heather Nurt said earlier this month.
But the only consideration was to impose sanctions against El Salvador, which received an estimated US$14 million in aid in 2017, including drug control, development and financial aid.
The proposed penalties, which included cuts in financial aid and targeted visa restrictions, would have been painful for this Central American country because of the high unemployment and murder rates in the country.
As the internal meeting proceeded, North American and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference focused on security and economic prosperity to follow up on the same conference last year, which was seen as a step in efforts to curb immigration to the United States.
But by mid-September, the top administration made clear that it wanted the conference to move forward and effectively end any sanctions for El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence will now address the conference, which is now scheduled to be held in mid-October and in the context of the call for the administrative sectors to attend the conference, the diplomats said.
And without any new harsh messages or warning from Washington, all three American ambassadors returned peacefully to El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama.
A White House spokesman for Mr. Bolton declined to give details of the talks, which were described by three US officials, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss internal deliberations on terms of anonymity.
Their accounts were confirmed by an external analyst who was close to the administration and also spoke on condition of anonymity.
The study of history
The next unlikely event could be Special Counsel Robert Mueller's report of Mr. Trump's possible obstruction of justice, which is now well documented in public records.
According to reports, Mr. Mueller is also turning his investigation into whether his election campaign is being plotted against Russia, including Mr. Trump's campaign.
If Congress changes its mind, Mr. Trump will find himself facing accountability in that institution when he's ready to go to the voters again, and maybe eventually to the jury of his peers.
There are many, if any, and I'm not saying that Mr. Trump's defeat is inevitable or that his counterparts in Europe are inevitable.
On both sides of the Atlantic, we all have options that will affect how long the conflict can last.
In 1938, if the West had opposed Hitler and supported Czechoslovakia in Munich, German officials would have been willing to overthrow Hitler.
We failed and missed the opportunity to avoid bloodshed in the coming year.
The study of history centred around the issues of such differences and the unceasing progress of democracy was accelerated or delayed.
The United States is now dealing with some of these issues of dissent.
What would you do if Mr. Trump removed Vice President General Rod Rosenstein, who was handling the sources of Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Since the newspaper reported that last year Rosenstein had suggested that he secretly recorded the president and that he was unfit for office, they have been in trouble.
Mr. Rosensetton has stated that the Times accounts are incorrect.
What would we do if the new FBI investigation of Brett Kavango was not complete or fair - or if he was convicted of sexual abuse and dishonesty - and sent to the Supreme Court?
Besides, we're going to hold midterm elections for Congress and Mr. Trump will be held accountable for it?
However, if we fail, democracy will be buried deeply for a long time.
But I'm sure you won't fail, because I took a class in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew, and she was forced to move to Auschwitz by the same Nazis who once occupied my embassy.
But she saved it, immigrated to the United States... and 60 years later, she made me light a Sabbath candle on the same table with the Swastika sign.
This is my story, so why not be positive about the future?

The Ranger hosted the Rapid Vienna on Thursday.
He feels that the interesting draw with Villarial in Spain this month after Austria's victory is weighing his chances of qualifying for the Europa League Group G.
A knee injury prevented Graham Dorance from starting the season strongly, but he believes the Rangers should see the game as a start to another brilliant performance as the result of a 2-2 draw against Villarial.
The 31-year-old said, "It was a good game for us because we have a very strong team".
We started the game thinking we were going to do something good and get points.
"Maybe we could have done it in the end, but the overall draw was probably a reasonable decision.
They were probably better in the first half and we came in the second half and got the top.
Thursday is starting, another big night in Europe.
"Hopefully we get three points but it will be a tough game because even though they scored well in the last game, I am sure with the support of the people we have, we will definitely achieve a positive result.
"The last year was really hard, in all respects, the injuries and the changes in the club, but this place is still a good thing.
The team is good and the kids are really enjoying it; training is good.
Fortunately, we can try to do that now, stay ahead of schedule and be successful".

Despite the clear idea of how to take care of the survey participants, some people were talking to their family members.
In a nationwide survey, nearly half of people said they were talking about the cost of long-term care with their spouses.
Only 10 percent of those who spoke to children said so.
"People want their family members to take care of them, but they are not taking any steps to communicate", said Holly Snyder, Vice President, Nationwide Life Insurance Business.
Start here.
Talk to your partner and children about this: You cannot prepare your family to take care of you if you do not tell them your wishes ahead of time.
Consult your counsellor and your family about where and how to take care of them, so that the choice of these things can be a key factor in determining costs.
Talk to your financial advisor: The advisor can show you some ways to pay for these expenses.
Your options for long-term supervision of funds may include a traditional long-term supervision insurance policy, a hybrid cash value life insurance policy to help cover these expenses, or self-insurance with your own property.
Withdraw your legal documents: Complete legal matters ahead of time.
Get a healthcare proxy so you can hire a trusted person to take care of your medical care and if you are unable to communicate, make sure that the professionals comply with your wishes.
Also, consider the Power of Attorney for your financial matters.
You will have to choose a trusted person for yourself and make sure that your bills are paid if you are incapacitated.
Don't forget the details: Imagine that your elderly parents are in a medical emergency and need to be treated in a hospital.
Can you answer questions about medicines and allergies?
All these details should be in writing so that you can be prepared.
"This picture is not just about financial matters, but who are the doctors?" Martin asked.
"What are medicines?
Who will take care of the dog?
Plan ahead".
In Ilfracombe, a man was shot several times with an air rifle.
One person was shot several times with an air rifle on his way home after spending a night out.
The victim, aged in his 40s, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe Devon when he was shot in the chest, stomach and hand.
Officials described the shooting, which occurred at around 2:30 BST, as "unintentional".
The victim is not the first to attack.
The injuries he sustained were not fatal and the police have appealed to witnesses.
The earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia
The severe earthquake and tsunami in the Indonesian city of Palau on Friday killed at least 384 people, officials said, with the death toll likely to rise.
As the contact was blocked, the relief officials could not get any information from the Donga Regency, which is located north of Palau and is in the center of a 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
More than 16,000 people were evacuated in the Palu after the disaster.
The following are the important facts about Palau and Dongla on Sulawesi Island:
Palau is the capital of Central Sulawesi Province, located at the end of a narrow bay on the western coast of Sulawesi Island, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami struck.
Dongla is a regency extending 300 km (180 mi) from the northwest coast of Sulawesi Island.
Regency, a province under the administration of the same name, had an estimated population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture are the mainstays of the economy of Central Sulawesi Province, especially the mountainous coastal region.
Nickel mining is also important in the region, but the focus is on the opposite side of the Sulawesi.
According to the Indonesian Institute of Disaster Management, Palau and the mountains have been hit by tsunamis several times in the last 100 years.
In 1938, the tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes.
In 1996, a tsunami struck the Western Hills, killing nine people.
Indonesia is located in the Pacific Ring of Fire and is regularly hit by earthquakes.
Some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years are:
2004: December 26, 2004: A major earthquake on the western coast of Aceh province, North Sumatra, Indonesia, caused a tsunami in 14 countries, killing 226,000 people, of whom more than half were in Aceh.
2005: In late March and early April, a powerful earthquake hit the western walls of Sumatra in a backdrop.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: 2006: A 6.8 magnitude tsunami hit the southernmost island of Java, Indonesia's most populous island, breaking through the southern coastline, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: 2009: A 7.6 magnitude earthquake struck near Padang, the capital of West Sumatra Province.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: 2010: A 7.5-magnitude earthquake struck Mentaaibeeta, Sumatra, which produced a 10-meter-high tsunami that destroyed dozens of villages and killed nearly 300 people.
2016: A shallow earthquake struck P.D. Jaya Regency in Aceh, which destroyed much of the city and created a fearful atmosphere that reminded people of the devastating earthquake and tsunami of 2004.
There was no tsunami, but over 100 people died as a result of the collapse of buildings.
2018: A major earthquake struck the Indonesian tourist island of Lombok, killing more than 500 people, mostly in the north of the island.
Thousands of buildings were destroyed and thousands of tourists were trapped for a while.
Sarah Pauline's eldest son was arrested on domestic violence charges.
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska Governor and Vice Presidential candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested on assault charges.
According to a report released by Alaska State officials, Palin, 29, of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence and on charges of interfering with domestic violence reporting and resisting arrest.
According to police reports, when a female acquaintance tried to call the police to report the crime, he withdrew the phone from her.
Palin is being remanded to the Mart-Su Pre-trial facility and is being held on bail of $500, KTUU reported.
In a media report, he was brought to court on Saturday, where he pleaded "not guilty" when questioned.
Palin will face a third-degree felony, which means he could face up to a year in prison and a $250,000 fine.
He has also been charged with a second degree felony, which carries a one-day jail sentence and a $2,000 fine.
This is not the first time that Palin has been charged with a crime.
In December 2017, he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Pauline.
His mother, Sarah Pauline, had called the police to report the attack.
The case is currently pending in the Alaska Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, interfering with reporting domestic violence crimes, and possessing intoxicating science in connection with the incident.
His friend alleged that he had punched her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veterans groups for linking her son's 2016 service in Iraq to PTSD with violent behavior.
Indonesia earthquake and tsunami: Hundreds killed
At least 384 people were killed in an earthquake on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The 7.5-magnitude earthquake caused a tsunami, destroying thousands of homes.
Power and communications are down in the coming days and the death toll is expected to rise.
The epicentre of the quake was located far from Central Sulawesi, which is northeast of the Indonesian capital Jakarta.
Videos showing the results of that moment are being circulated on social media.
Hundreds of people gathered for a celebration on the beach in the city of Palamou when a tsunami struck the beach.
Federal prosecutors demanding a strict death sentence for suspected New York terrorist attacks
The death penalty is being sought for New York federal prosecutor Syfflow Cypaev, a suspect in the New York terrorist attack that killed eight people -- the state has not imposed such a stringent sentence for federal crimes since 1953.
Cypave, 30, used a rented home depot truck to attack a bicycle road near the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan in October.
To be eligible for the death penalty under the death penalty imposed in the Southern District of New York, prosecutors must prove that Cypow "considered" the deaths of the eight and "considered" the serious physical injury.
According to court documents, the death penalty can be accepted in both cases.
Several weeks after the attack, a federal grand jury indicted Cypaov on 22 counts, including eight counts of racketeering-assisted murder, in general: federal prosecutors and motor vehicle destruction in organized crime cases.
Describing what Sipov did as "abhorrent, cruel and degrading", the lawyer said that "important planning and pre-warning" were needed for the attack.
"Safflo Habibulvevic Sipov has hurt, damaged and harmed the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleaves, Anne-Laure Decad, Darren Drake, Ariel Erliz, Hernán Ferrucci, Hernán Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnuco.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
The Southern District of New York has been running a death sentence case for a decade.
Defendant Khalid Barnes was convicted of the murder of two drug dealers but was eventually sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last time was in 1953, when Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple, were sentenced to death in a New York federal trial on charges of conspiring to spy for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
On June 19, 1953, the Rosenberg couple were executed in the electric chair.
According to court documents, the native of Uzbekistan, Saipov, demonstrated his lack of remorse in the days after the attack.
Police said he told investigators that he felt good about what he did.
According to the indictment, Sipov told investigators that after watching videos of Isis on his mobile phone, he was inspired to attack.
Police say he also requested that the Isis flag be flown in his hospital room.
He maintained that he was not guilty of the alleged 22-file charge.
David Patton, one of the Federal Public Defenders representing Cypov, said he was "completely disappointed" with the prosecution's decision.
"We think that the death penalty should be fixed, that accepting any demand for life imprisonment would increase the suffering of all those involved", Patton said.
Saipov's defense team had earlier asked prosecutors not to execute him.
MP Torich has said that Nigel Farage should be in charge of Brexit negotiations.
During the Tory Council protests, Nigel Farj swore to form the People's Army Association.
The former UKIP leader said politicians should be aware of Eurosceptics - as MEP Theresa May suggested, they should have the means to negotiate with the EU.
Conservative Peter Bone told the Birmingham crowd that if Mr Farage had been Brexit Secretary, the UK would have 'been out of it' by now.
However, the separate protests of Ramen Tories against Brexit in the city have made the obstacles to Mrs May's group more clear.
Even in the face of criticism from Brexiters, remeners and the EU, they have to struggle to maintain their checkered promises.
Friends say that despite opposition, they should try to establish relations with Brussels and put pressure on Eurosceptics and Labour to choose one of their plans or 'mess'.
Mr. Bone explained to Live Means Live rally in Solihill that he wanted to 'end the relationship with the Chequers'.
He also suggested that Mr. Farraz should be taken along and given responsibility for the negotiations with Brussels.
If they had these formulae, we would be out by now", he said.
A Wellingborough MP said: "I will stand by Brexit, but we must get the Chequers out".
He said: "We did not participate in the Second World War to gain second place".
We want our laws in our country.
In his statement, Mr. Bone denied that the public opinion had changed since the 2016 elections, saying: "The idea that British people have changed their minds, their demands and now they want to live in the same system is wrong".
Tory Brexit leader Andrea Jenkins was also present at the rally. Speaking to reporters, she said: "I will say nothing more: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
There is anger among the general public about the Chechens, the opposition will not vote for them, there is also a hostile atmosphere among our party and our activists who have devised this path by electing us to the top position.
Please, leave the checkers and start listening to others.
In a clear message to Mrs May, he said: 'The Prime Minister can only hold his office if he keeps his promises.'
Addressing Morcha, Mr. Farage said that politicians who want to betray the people in 2016 should be aware of this.
He added that this has now become a question of trust between us - the people and our political class.
They're trying to betray Brexit, and we want to tell them today, right now, here that we're not going to let you do that.
Addressing the enthusiastic crowd gathered here, he said: "I think you should teach this lesson to our politicians who are trying to betray Brexit, who are on the path to it".
"We are building an army of the people of this country that will lead us to victory in Brexit and that army will not be able to stay healthy unless we become an independent, self-governing and proud United Kingdom".
Meanwhile, the Remnants marched to Birmingham before marching for two hours in the city centre.
This weekend, some activists formed a group and launched a protest called Tories Against Brexit.
Lord Adonis, considered a friend of the Labour Party, took the Conservative Party to the streets with the opening of the conference on the security issues in the party's app.
These are the people who tell us that the IT system is working well and all these technologies will make Canada Plus Plus, peace on the border, free trade without the border of Ireland and so on".
It's all fake.
There is no such thing as a proper Brexit", he added.
Warren will seriously consider running for president.
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren said she would seriously consider running for president after the November election.
According to The Boston Globe, the Massachusetts Democrat was speaking on Saturday at Town Hall in Western Massachusetts about his plans for the future.
Warren, who has consistently criticized President Donald Trump, is running for re-election in November against GOP State Representative Geoff D.L.
There is a debate about whether they will stand against Trump in the 2020 election.
After Trump took office, the meeting he held Saturday in Holyoke was the 36th meeting with voters who had adopted the town hall system.
One of the members present here asked him if he was considering running for the presidency.
"It's time for women to go to Washington to stand up to our embarrassed government", Warren said, "and that means women have the highest office".
One man has been arrested for the murder of LSU's Sims.
Baton Rouge, LA police announced Saturday that a suspect has been arrested in the shooting death of LSU basketball player Wade Sims on Friday.
Baton Rouge Police Department said that 20-year-old DeTeon Simpson was arrested at ET News Conference at 11:00 am.
Police have released a video of the shooting and have requested to identify the person in the video footage.
Sims, 20, was shot and killed near the Southern University campus on Friday morning.
"Wyde Sims was shot in the head and killed", police chief Murphy J. Paul told the media, according to 247Sports.
Wade fell in to save his friend, and Simpson shot him.
Simpson admitted that during the police investigation, you were on the scene, you had a hit man, and you shot Wade Sims.
Simpson was easily arrested by the police and is being held at the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
Sims, a 6-foot-6, strong junior basketball player, grew up in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. He started 10 of his 32 games last season, averaging 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Louis Hamilton, who was ordered to field by the team, beat Sebastian Vettel to win the world championship.
It was only when Valterie Botas qualified with more points than Louis Hamilton on Saturday that it became clear that the Mercedes team's command would now be crucial in the tournament.
Bottas had a good start at the pole, taking Hamilton's place in the first two turns, and he had knocked Hamilton out almost, so it was time for Wettle to beat his own team player.
Hamilton left the end of the pack in traffic and went to the pits before the waitress did.
Mercedes then re-rooted to the back of the wagon, but after some very interesting moments, Hamilton took the lead and the Ferrari driver had to unwittingly release the inside for a third place, risking a double move.
Max Verstappen started from the back of the grid and finished seventh at the end of the first round of the competition, which marked his 21st birthday.
He then went on to finish the race, overtaking Kimi Ryokanen for fourth place, with a better grip on his car for the remainder of the race.
He finally got into the pit in lap 44, but with Rykonen in fourth place, he was unable to accelerate further.
It was a really tough day, and Valterie did a great job and he's very polite.
The team has done an amazing job of getting one to two", Hamilton said.
It's really very bad behavior.
Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavango has been accused of sexual harassment by Christine Blaise Ford, but the letter from Ford, which she claimed was not released, was denied by Senator Diane Feinstein, who said the allegations were false at a meeting held by President Donald Trump on Saturday.
Speaking to the West Virginia House of Representatives, President Ford directly quoted Ford as saying, without citing testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, that what is happening in the Senate is showing how "selfish, vicious and deceitful" people have become.
"What's going on in the Senate these last few days is what's going on, what's going to happen... when you see people angry, you see people angry, angry, selfish, and lying".
"You look at the advertisements, you leak them, and then you say... oh... I didn't".
I didn't.
Do you remember?
Hey, Dean Feinstein, did you leak this?
And they said, "Did you leak these documents?"
Oh, no, not at all.
I didn't leak it.
Um, wait a minute.
Did we leak it... No, we didn't"... The president made the same statement as the senator.
Ford sent a letter to Feinstein in July about the charges against Kavango, which was leaked in early September, but Feinstein denies the leak from his office.
I have not hidden Dr. Ford's accusations, but I have not leaked his letter, Feinstein told the committee, The Hill Reporter reported.
They told me to keep it a secret, and I kept it that way.
But the president was not very pleased with his refusal, and he said at the meeting on Saturday night, "I tell you, this is very bad behavior".
They may not have done it, but it was the worst behavior I've ever seen.
Addressing the Supreme Court representative who was accused of sexual misconduct by three women, the President said that these Democrats are using these allegations to their advantage.
They want to regain power by doing something.
You see the selfishness, the cruelty, they don't care if they hurt someone, they don't care who they're crushing to gain power and dominance, they don't want to see who they're crushing to gain power and dominance", the president said.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 with the Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee.
Dundee Stars returned to the Elite League on Friday by defeating Belfast Giants 5-3 in a return game on Saturday.
Patrick Dwyer and Francis Bowielier scored early in the game, giving the Giants an immediate two-goal lead.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Kawhi tied the host team before Dwyer led the Giants back to the top.
Francois Boccard tied Dundee and then Lucas Lundwald Nelson's goal won the match.
This is Adam Keefe's third defeat in the Elite League this season, having previously been behind Dundee 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night.
This was the fourth meeting between the two teams this season, the last three games being won by the Giants.
Dwyer scored the first goal at 3:35 a.m. with Kendall McFaul backing up four minutes before the start of the game.
The opening period of the match was packed with events. In the 13:10 minute Sullivan scored a goal to maintain the challenge of the host team, then in the 15:16 minute with the help of Matt Markardt, Kauni scored a goal and tied the match.
At the end of the first period, Dwyer scored his second goal and confirmed that the Giants had regained the lead in the first break.
"The Jamaican team again took the strategy and in the 27th minute, Boccard scored a power play goal and once again tied the team".
Cooney and Charles Corcoran came together to help Nelson score a goal and Dundee took the lead for the first time in the game at the end of the second half. He scored the fifth goal in the final period of the game, which set the team's victory.
The Giants, who have lost four of their last five games, will now play their next game on Friday at their home ground against Milton Keynes.
Death of air traffic controller who rescued hundreds of passengers from earthquake
After making sure that the plane carrying hundreds of passengers was safe, Hero became the death-dealing air traffic controller for Indonesia.
The massive quake on Sulawesi Island on Friday killed 800 people and left many missing, and triggered tsunami waves.
The entire area has been devastated by severe post-earthquake shocks and many people have been trapped under the rocks in the city of Palo.
The control tower at Mutiara Sisi Al Jufri Airport in Palú was shaken by the earthquake. Although the other comrades left the tower for fear of death, 21-year-old Anthony Guanavan Agung refused to leave his position.
At that time, Batik Air Flight 6321 was on runway, and it did not move from its seat to allow it to fly safely.
He then jumped from there after realizing that the traffic control tower was collapsing.
He later died in hospital.
Air Navigation Indonesia spokesman Johannes Sirat said his decision may have saved hundreds of lives, Australian news agency ABC News reported.
We had a helicopter ready at Balikappan in Kalimantan to take him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost it this morning before the helicopter reached Pallu.
"We were very saddened to hear this news", he added.
Meanwhile, the administrative system is worried that the death toll will reach the 1000 mark. The Emergency Management Agency says that it is difficult to reach all parts of Dongla, Singyi and Boutong.
"The death toll is likely to rise further, as many bodies are still crushed under the remains and we have not been able to reach that point", the agency spokesperson said.
Waves up to 6 meters high have destroyed the city of Palo.
Military and commercial aircraft are providing relief and essential supplies.
"Risa Kusuma, 35, told Sky News: "Every minute, the morgue is bringing bodies.
Clean water is scarce.
There is looting everywhere in small markets".
"The Indonesian Red Cross is running to help survivors but we don't know exactly what they will get there", said Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, to CNN.
This situation is already very painful, but it can get even worse".
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palau on Sunday and told the army: "I am asking you all to work day and night to complete every job related to the resettlement.
Are you ready? CNN reported this.
Earlier this year, an earthquake in Lombok, Indonesia, killed more than 550 people.
Air Nugini is now saying that one man has been missing after the plane crashed in the Gulf.
The airline operating the plane that crashed in the Gulf in the Pacific region of Micronesia has now said that one passenger is missing after the crash.
A press release issued by Air Nugini said that the company had not identified a male passenger until Saturday afternoon.
We are working with local authorities, hospitals and investigation authorities to find the person.
When asked for more details such as the age or nationality of the passenger, the airline immediately gave no response.
Local boats helped rescue passengers and crew after the plane crashed while attempting to land at the airport on the island of Foul.
Seven people have been taken to hospital, officials said on Friday.
Six of the passengers were hospitalized on Saturday and all are in stable condition, the airline said.
The exact cause and sequence of the crashes has not yet been determined.
The airline and the US Navy have said that the plane landed before reaching the runway.
Some witnesses believe that the plane went beyond the runway.
American traveler Bill Janice said the plane went down a lot.
"It was a very good thing", said Janice.
Janice said he and other passengers jumped out of the sinking plane through an emergency exit route and walked across the water.
He said that the flight crew were terrified and screaming, and they also suffered minor head injuries.
The U.S. Navy said that they were involved in the rescue operation, which involved the crew of a nearby shipwreck repair ship, which was flown to shore in an inflatable boat before sinking to a depth of 30 meters.
The aviation safety network reported that 111 people have died in accidents involving PNG-registered airlines in the last two years, but none of them were from Air New Guinea.
Analysts have described the events of the night the woman was burned alive.
The ruling party completed its argument on Saturday in a roundup of a man accused of burning a woman alive in Mississippi in 2014.
Paul Rowlett, an analyst with the U.S. Department of Justice, testified for an hour as an expert in intelligence analysis.
He explained to the jury how he examined cell phone records to find out exactly what happened between her and 29-year-old accused Quinton Teles on the night Jessica Chambers died.
Rolette said that she collected location data from several cell phones to verify that Chambers was with her the evening she died.
The available data shows that his cell phone was near the cell phone of the Chamber at the time, and Teles said that he was with his friend Michael Sanford at the time.
Sanford appeared in court on Saturday and testified that he was not in town that day.
When government lawyers asked Sanford about Teles claiming to be in a Sanford truck that night, Sanford said Teles was lying about it.
Another difference is that Chambers was known to us two weeks before she died, Teles said.
From the cell phone records, it appears that they started to recognize each other only a week ago.
Rolette said that sometime after Chambers' death, Teles deleted all her messages, calls, contact information from his phone.
"He took her out of our lives", said Hale.
The defence will begin its final argument on Sunday.
The trial is expected to be held before the jury on the same day, the judge said.
What is conscientious hip hop?
The hip hop trio wants to fill our music with positive messages to challenge the negative outlook on this genre.

Another black person?!
A nanny in New York sued a couple for being dismissed from their jobs based on "discriminatory" messages.
"A nanny couple in New York is suing for being fired for discrimination after her mother mistakenly sent us a message claiming she was ""another black person"".
The couple has denied the allegations of racial discrimination, claiming that the case is a form of "breakup" request.
When the new babysitter first came to work in 2016, Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, expressed dislike for the fact that she was black.
"NSSSSSSSSSSSSS is another black man", wrote the message of Sa.
Instead of sending the message to her husband, she mistakenly sent it to Mrs. Morris, who also sent it twice.
After the confusion was discovered, the "difficult" Pwasko-Flaxman fired Mrs. Morris, who had an African-American grandmother who was doing bad things, and she said that we now need a Filipino grandmother.
Mrs. Morris was paid for a day's work and then sent home by Uber.
Now, Mrs. Morris is suing the couple for a reduction in pay, and they are demanding compensation of $350 a day for six months, which they were hired with a promise of full-time employment, but no contract has been reached.
"I want to show them that you can't do that", he told the Post on Friday. "I know, it's racial discrimination", he added.
The couple has denied the allegations of racism, and the couple claimed that it is no longer possible to trust Ms. Morris because she was hurt.
"My wife sent them things she didn't want to tell her".
It's not racism.
We are not racist people", said husband Joel Plasco to Post.
"But, after you've done something bad to someone, do you turn your kids over to the same person?
Would you give your newborn to that person?
It's not possible".
Accusing the case of being a form of "breakup", Placebo said that his wife had given birth two months ago and is currently in "extremely difficult circumstances".
"Does anyone follow someone like that?"
"This is not a good thing", said Plasco, an investment banker by trade.
While the court case is still ongoing, the Janta court has issued a statement on social media against the couple, which has been heavily criticized for their behavior and arguments.
The Paddington publishers were worried that readers would not be able to accept the idea of a talking bear, a new letter reveals.
Bond's daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was published, said of the letter: "It is difficult to understand the mindset of anyone who reads it for the first time before it is published".
It's very interesting to know what we know about Paddington's huge success".
She says the father who wrote children's books inspired by a toy bear after working as a cameraman for the BBC would have remained optimistic if the book had been rejected. She also says that his passing last year has marked the 60th anniversary of the book's publication.
She describes Paddington as "a very important member of our family", and she added that her father was very proud of the success he eventually achieved.
"They were very quiet. They never wanted to play their own drums", she said.
"But Padington was really important to them, so if your child succeeds, you're really proud of it, even if it's not your responsibility.
I think that's how they looked at Paddington's success.
It was his invention and his imagination, but he always credited Paddington with it".
My daughter was counting the last few minutes, and I had to say goodbye to her on the phone.
After landing, her daughter was taken to Lou Pasteur's Hospital in Nice, where doctors tried to rescue her but to no avail.
"Nad was calling me regularly and saying that the situation was very bad. I don't think she's going to get out of this", said Saou.
"Then I got a call from Nad and he said she was going to die in the next couple of minutes and I wanted to say goodbye to her.
And I said goodbye to her.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, baby.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The medication doctors gave her to continue pumping her heart was slowly decreasing and her systems were shutting down.
She had just died and everything was closing.
I just wanted to sit back and wait, and I knew it was all coming together.
I couldn't scream, I couldn't scream, I couldn't cry, because I was surrounded by so many families and people.
I really had to take care of myself".
Eventually, Saude Adnan-Laparous, mourning the loss of her daughter, sat on the plane with other passengers, with no idea which way she was going.
"No one knew", he said.
"I was down my neck and tears were continually flowing from my eyes.
It's a little hard to explain, but when I was on the plane, I was so moved by the feeling of being with Ned.
He needed my love, I needed to understand him.
I knew how much he loved her".
Women in distress post cards to prevent suicide from happening on a bridge.
Two women who lost their loved ones to suicide are now working to prevent the rest from committing suicide.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys post inspirational messages and cards with phone numbers on the Welsh Bridge, which people can call for help with.
Mrs. Davis' son, Tyler, had been suffering from depression since he was 13 years old, and he committed suicide at the age of 18.
"I don't think any parent should have the time to deal with what I'm going through every day", she said.
Mrs. Davis, 45, lives in Lidney, and her son was an emerging chef with a smile on his face that would make anyone smile.
"Everyone knew him for his smile.
"He always said that his laughter would brighten up the place".
But he quit before he died because "he was really living in the dark".
In 2014, Tyler committed suicide when his 11-year-old brother saw him dead.
Mrs. David said: "I am just as concerned that it will have some indirect effect on him".
Mrs. David created the cards, "to make these people aware that there are people you can go to, people you can talk to, who can be your friends.
Don't sit still - you need to talk".
Mrs. Humphries and Mrs. Davis have been friends for many years. Mrs. Humphries lost her 15-year-old partner Mark. Shortly after his mother's death, he also committed suicide.
"He never said he was feeling depressed, he never said anything", she said.
"A couple of days after Christmas, we began to notice a slight change in his attitude.
He had no money in his pocket on Christmas Day - he avoided staring at the children when they opened their presents".
She said that his death was a huge shock to her family, but we got out of it.
It split us.
But we have nothing but to keep moving forward and keep fighting".

Brett Kavanaugh's future is a bit off the table as the FBI has opened an investigation.
"I thought that if we really got what he was asking for - a limited investigation, limited opportunities - maybe we could bring a little unity", Mr. Flake said on Saturday, adding that he feared he was "breaking" into the habit of a party party gridlock.
Why do Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters need an FBI investigation?
Their reluctance is due only to time.
There are only six weeks left until the midterm elections, which are on November 6 -- if the Republicans are doing as badly as expected, they will be very weak in their efforts to send a man elected to the country's highest court.
Mr. Kavanaugh picked up the phone to call Senator George W. Bushney to create a crowd of supporters.
What happens when the FBI reports?
51 Republicans and 49 Democrats will vote in the current Senate.
It is still unclear whether Mr. Kavanaugh will get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which will allow Mike Pence, Vice President, to be relegated and retained in the Supreme Court.
Under Kim, the number of North Korean intruders decreased.
South Korean lawmakers say that the number of North Korean intruders to South Korea has decreased since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago.
Referring to data from the Ministry of South Unification, Park Byong-sung said that last year there were 1,127 break-ins compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Mr Park said that the strict border controls between North Korea and China and the high volume of money from human trafficking were important factors.
Pyongyang has not made any public comments.
Several North Korean intruders have been granted South Korean citizenship.
Seoul says that at the end of the Korean War in 1953, more than 30,000 North Koreans had crossed the border illegally.
Many of them live in China, which has a large border with North Korea, and crossing this border is easier than crossing the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China considers intruders illegal travelers rather than refugees and forcibly returns them.
The relations between North and South - even though technically war is still going on - have improved significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang to discuss non-nuclear power negotiations.
This follows a wide-ranging discussion on the Korean peninsula free of nuclear power at the historic June meeting in Singapore between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Lee Yong-ho broke the lack of progress since then with US sanctions.
"We cannot feel confident about our national security without showing any confidence in the United States and in such a situation we will not be able to disarm ourselves unilaterally", Rey said in a speech to the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "Bebhan" and says he is incapable of serving on the Supreme Court.
Home Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi called Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh "Bevane" and said he was unable to serve on the Supreme Court for some time.
Pelosi commented in an interview Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin.
"I can't do anything about it but it seems that if a woman did it, they would call her 'Bevane,'" Pelosi said of Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally denied allegations of sexual abuse against Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
Kavanaugh was very friendly when he started talking, sometimes screaming about his family and high school days, sometimes his throat was squeezed.
The charges against him were that Hillary Clinton had come together to express her anger over her 2016 presidential defeat, and he had explicitly accused the Democrats of being a "coordinated murder of weirdness and character".
Pelosi has said that Kavanaugh's testimony proved that he cannot serve on the Supreme Court, as it proves that he is biased in the case of Democrats.
"I think they've made themselves unfit by following up on their statements and Clinton and Democrats", he said.
He was reluctant to ask if the Pelosi would question his legitimacy if Kavanaugh were appointed and the Democrats won a majority in the House of Representatives.
"I'll just say-- if they don't tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, they're not only in the Supreme Court, they're not eligible for the courts they're in now", Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge in the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals.
Pelosi said that as a Democrat he is concerned about the handling of the Kavanaugh's Affordable Care Act or RoV Wade's potential lawsuit against him, as Kavanaugh is considered a conservative judge.
During the confirmation hearing, Kavanaugh abandoned the question whether he would abide by some of the Supreme Court's decisions.
"This is no time for some stupid, biased man to go to court and expect us to say, 'Oh, how great!' " said Pelosi.
And women need to use their weapons.
This was the right voice, months and years passed by, and she had no choice but to cry.
"When you're angry, you cry", Mrs. Steinem told me 45 years later.
"I don't think this is unusual, what do you think?"
She went on to say, "I was so supported by a woman who worked in an executive, she said she was so angry that she wanted to cry, but she developed a technique that when she started to cry and get angry, she would say to the man who was talking, "You think I'm crying because I'm sad.
I'm angry with you".
And then they kept on telling me.
And I thought it was amazing".
Tears are allowed as a drain of anger because there is a basic misunderstanding about them.
One of the most intense memories of my early career was that in a male-dominated office, where I once saw myself crying uncomfortably and angry, an elderly woman - a cold-blooded manager I was always afraid of - grabbed me by the neck and dragged me to the wall of my genitals.
"Don't ever let them see you cry", she told me.
"They didn't realize you were angry.
They think you're sad and they'll be happy about it.
Patricia Schroeder, a Democratic congresswoman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart for the presidential election.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught on a boat called Monkey Business on the occasion of an extramarital affair, Mrs. Schroeder was very disappointed and began to wonder why we should not stand for the presidential election ourselves.
"It wasn't a well thought out decision", she told me, laughing after 30 years.
"There are already seven candidates in the race and the last thing they want is another candidate.
Someone called it "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs".
"The campaign was delayed, and they were behind in raising funds, so they decided they would not fight until they had raised $2 million".
It was a losing battle.
She realized that her supporters who paid 1,000 dollars to men paid her 250 dollars.
"Do they think I get a discount?" she was thinking to herself.
When he announced that he would not launch a formal campaign, he was so upset by the emotions - his gratitude to the people who supported him, his anger at the system that made it difficult to raise money, and his anger at representatives and sexuality rather than targeting voters.
"You may have thought I was lost in the mind", Mrs. Schroeder said of the symbolism given to her by the newspapers.
"You may have thought that Clenex was my corporate sponsor.
I remember thinking, what would they write on my tombstone?
"Why did she cry?"
How can the trade war between the US and China benefit Beijing?
Because of the trade war between the US and China, and the lack of any signs of war ending, the gap between these countries could be beneficial to Beijing in the long run, experts say.
US President Donald Trump has issued the first warning by imposing taxes on major Chinese exports including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
This week, with new rates impacting $200 billion, there has been a dramatic increase in taxes on all goods from China to the United States.
Beijing has resisted each time by paying tariffs on imported goods of 5 to 10 percent, compared to the most recent US$60 billion.
China has vowed to follow in the footsteps of the United States and soon the world's largest economy will never be ignored.
Withdrawing Washington means meeting demands, but publicly greeting the United States would be very uncomfortable for Chinese President Xi Jinping.
Still, experts say that if Beijing could play its game properly, China could provide long-term positive support by reducing the interdependence of both economies due to the pressure of US trade wars.
In fact, the economic loop that would start in either country if a political decision was made in Washington or Beijing is more dangerous than people have previously assumed, "said Abigail Grace, a research associate who focuses on Asia at the Center for New American Security, a think tank.
The Foreign Minister said Syria is ready to return the refugees.
Syria is ready to return the refugees voluntarily and they have asked for help to rebuild the country devastated by the war that has lasted for more than seven years.
Speaking to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Ma'olem said that the situation in the country is improving.
"The progress made in the fight against terrorism today has made our region more stable and secure", he said.
The government has started resettlement in areas destroyed by terrorists to improve the general situation.
All conditions are now ready to voluntarily return the refugees who have been forced to leave our country due to terrorism and unilateral economic measures aimed at their daily lives and livelihoods.
The United Nations estimates that 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the start of the war in 2011.
There are six million other people still living in the country who need charity.
Al-Ma'lem said the Syrian government will help rebuild the devastated country.
But he insisted that he would not accept conditional assistance or assistance from the countries providing the armed assistance.
Europe has sealed the Ryder Cup in Paris.
At Le Golf National outside Paris, France, the European team won the 2018 Ryder Cup by defeating the United States by a final score of 16.5 to 10.5.

The team of Danish captain Thomas Bajrén, who scored the necessary 14.5 points to defeat the United States, regained the crown of Europe.
American star Phil Mickelson wrestled in many competitions, diving his T-shot with a 3-16th hole to face Francisco Molineri.
Italian golfer Mollineri became the first of four players to shine through all of his rounds, leading 5-0-0 since the tournament's current format began in 1979.
European player Thorborn Olsen of Denmark, the lowest ranked player in the European team, was eliminated by American Jordan Spith by a score of 5-4.
World No. 1 Dustin Johnson was beaten 2-1 by England's Ian Polter, who may have played for the Ryder Cup final.
An eight-time Ryder Cup veteran, Sergio Garcia of Spain became the all-time European champion with 25.5 career points.
"I don't usually cry, but I can't do anything today.
It's been a tough year.
I am grateful to Thomas for choosing me and for trusting me.
I am very happy to have the cup back.
It's about the team and I'm happy that I'm able to help", said the emotional Garcia after the European victory.
He handed the torch to fellow countryman John Rahm who on Sunday beat US golf legend Tiger Woods 2-1 in a single game.
"I feel incredible pride in defeating Tiger Woods", said 23-year-old Rahm. "I've grown up watching him".
Woods lost all four of his matches in France and now has a Ryder Cup career record of 13-21-3
"A strange figure was predicted by one of the greatest players of all time, Jack Nicklaus won only 14 major titles".
The USA team traveled throughout the weekend to find the fairway, except for the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played high-performance golf throughout the tournament.
U.S. captain Jim Furyk made a statement about his team's disappointing performance, saying, "I'm proud of these people, they fought.
This morning, we tried to pressure the European Union.
We fought hard.
Greetings to Thomas.
He is a great captain.
All 12 of his players played great games.
"We'll reconnect again, I'll work with the PGA of America and the Ryder Cup committee, and we'll move on.
I love these 12 and I'm proud to be the captain.
You should commend them.
We went out.
