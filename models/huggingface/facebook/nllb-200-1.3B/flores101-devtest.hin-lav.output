Finally, there are many small cats (including the loose - belly cats) that eat many small organisms such as insects, rodents, snails and birds.
Each cat has a special job that keeps it from competing with others.
The largest social cats are the ones that live in large groups called pride.
The lion group is made up of one to three adult males and more than thirty females and cubs.

Scientists believe that oselots chase and eat animals by smell, sniffing out where they might have been on earth.
They can see very well in the dark, and they can move very stealthily. The Ausilts move around their surroundings and then they hit their prey with their fists.
When a small group of organisms (small population) becomes separated from the part of the main population from which they came (e. g. if they came from a mountain range or river or if they moved to a new island so that they could not easily retreat), they often find themselves in an alien environment.

The native population has not changed, they still want the same adaptation as before.

Eventually, thousands or millions of years later, the two populations will appear so different that they can't be called the same species.
We call this process speciesization, which means the formation of new species. Speciesization is a good step and a very important part of evolution.

still made today, but more importantly, its orientation ratio is inherited by digital camera image sensor formats.
35 mm is actually a little bit confusing, which is 24 mm in height x 36 mm in width.
The orientation ratio of this format (dividing by twelve to get the simplest integer ratio) is therefore called 3:2.
Many common formats (e.g., APS family of formats) are approximately equal to or near this orientation ratio.

Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a wide range of ideas in practice, from technology - push or technological imperativity to the strict sense that human destiny is driven by an underlying logic associated with scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism are about two general ideas: technological development has no influence on cultural or political influence and as a result, rather than being socially adapted, it "affects" the societies in which the technology is found.
For example, one might say that motor cars necessarily affect the development of roads.

In terms of sanity, geography shaped individuals and over time, customs and cultures associated with that geography emerged. Because of being in tune with the place of society, these people were far superior to arbitrarily imposed laws.


The situation had deteriorated during the 12th century mainly because the crusaders brought gifts such as silk and spices, which were more valuable than what the Byzantine markets offered.

Gothic style was at its peak between the 10th and 11th centuries and in the 14th century.

Historically, most farmers have been subsistence farmers and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Subculture brings together like - minded individuals who feel themselves to be backward in social norms and allows them to develop a sense of identity.
Subculture can vary because of the age, race, class, location, and/or gender of the members.
The qualities that make a subculture different, such as language, aesthetics, religion, politics, sexuality, geography, or a combination of many factors.
members of a subculture often indicate their membership through a distinctive and symbolic use of style, including fashion, manners, and idioms.
Some of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization are to draw on the unfortunate cases of children who were not neglected by adults as they grew up, but through neglect, misfortune or abuse.
Some wild children are isolated from the world by people (mostly their parents) or in some cases by parents because of a mental or physical deficiency of the children.

Others were reportedly brought by animals; some are said to have been living in the wild themselves.
Once fully domesticated, wild babies behave in much the same way (within physical limits) as special - care animals, such as being afraid or careless of humans.

Scaffolding is not a learning method, but rather a tool for people who are learning something new, like running a new computer program or starting a new project.
The scaffold can be virtual and real, in other words, the teacher is a kind of scaffold, but the Microsoft Office PaperClip Man is the same.
Virtual scaffolding is an internal part of the software and it questions, indicates and provides information about processes which are challenging for the student to handle alone.
children are placed in foster care for many reasons, including neglect, abuse, and even forced recovery.
No child should ever grow up in an environment that is not nurturing, caring and educating, but they are growing up.
We consider the foster care system to be a safe haven for these children.
Our foster care system provides safe homes, loving care, stable education and reliable health care.
Foster care is all about meeting all the needs that weren't being met in the home they were brought from.
Internet combines elements of both people and interpersonal communication.
The different features of the Internet lead to additional dimensions in terms of approach to use and satisfaction.
For example,learning andsocialization have been cited as the main reasons for using the Internet (James et al., 1995).
When Amy and McCord (1998) investigated audience responses to websites, they also identified private participation and continuous connection as inspiring new aspects.
The use of video recordings to interpret micro-expressions, facial movements that take a few milliseconds, has led to important discoveries.
In particular, it is claimed that by correctly interpreting a person 's subtle expressions it can be explained whether he is lying or not.
Oliver Sacks, in his paper The Presidential Speech, pointed out how people who cannot understand speech because of brain damage can still make a good judgment about honesty.
They also suggest that the ability to interpret human behavior can be shared by pets such as dogs.
20th century research has shown that there are two pools of genetic variation: hidden and expressed.
mutation adds new genetic variation, and selection removes it from the pool of expressed variation.
The separation and recombination variation goes back and forth between the two pools with each generation.
In savannahs, there may be a shortage of plants available to meet the amino acid requirements of digestive primates like humans.
Plus, failure to do so has serious consequences: increased depression, malnutrition, and eventually death.
The easiest resources to get from plants are the proteins found in leaves and beans, but for primates like us, it's hard to digest them without cooking.
The animal foods (ants, worms, eggs) are not only easy to digest, but they also provide a high amount of protein containing all the essential amino acids.
if our ancestors solved their protein problem in some way, we shouldn't be surprised, as chimpanzees do today.
Sleep apnea is the process of waking you up during your normal sleep period and then going away after a short time (10-60 minutes).
This can be easily done by using a relatively quiet alarm clock to bring you to consciousness without being completely awake.

Other biorid - based options include drinking lots of fluids before bedtime (especially water or tea, a popular diuretic), forcing the person to urinate.
The amount of inner peace a person has is inversely correlated with the amount of stress that exists in his body and soul.
The less worry, the more positive life energy the individual can find.

Tibet Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but enhanced by many techniques from the Mahayana Way of Love and Indian Yoga.
Tibetan Buddhism is very simple in principle.It includes Kundalini Yoga, meditation and the path of lovingly embracing all.

In the last two years of the war, the former allies had become enemies and the Cold War had begun.
It was going to be for the next 40 years and it was going to be real, by pseudo-armies, on the battlefields from Africa to Asia, Afghanistan, Cuba, and many other places.
September 17, 1939, Polish defenses were nearly broken, and the only hope was to retreat and then unite with the Romanian bridgehead.

The use of ships for the transport of goods is a much more efficient way of bringing and carrying large quantities of people and goods from one end of the oceans to the other.
The Navy's job is traditionally to maintain the ability to move people and goods from one country to another, and to interfere with the ability to move people and goods from the enemy country.
The most notable recent example of this was the North Atlantic campaign of World War II. The Americans were trying to move troops and supplies across the Atlantic Ocean to assist Britain.
The German Navy was also trying to stop this traffic, mainly using U - boats.
if the Allies had failed, Germany might have defeated Britain because she had the rest of Europe.
It is believed that goat breeding began in the Zagros Mountains of Iran 10,000 years ago.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to keep milk, hair, meat and leather within their easy reach.
Domestic goats were generally kept in herds that roamed the hills or other grazing areas, often going towards the herd of goats where there were often children or teenagers, similar to the more widely known shepherds. These methods of herding are still used today.
Wagonways were built in England in the early 16th century.
Although the wagonway normally had uniform wooden planks, the horses could pull them at high speeds and carry larger loads on the slightly more rugged roads of the day.

It became commonplace, but iron wheels were more likely to rub against wooden wheels.
Finally, iron wheels replaced wooden wheels. In 1767, the railways were made entirely of iron.
The first known transport was walking, humans began walking with the emergence of Homo erectus 2 million years ago.
Strelopithecus, their ancestor, did not walk straight.
Bipedals are found in the fossils of Australopopithecus 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, although perhaps 7 million years ago, the coenthropod could walk on two legs.

It is similar to pathological therapy in many ways. However, if we do not want only temporary solutions, we must find the root of the problems and disable them.
It is quite clear that the world has changed a lot due to the scientific and technological progress of mankind, and the problems have increased due to the overpopulation and the over - spending lifestyle of mankind.
After being adopted by Congress on July 4, a handwritten draft was signed by Congress President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Theron, then sent to John Dunlop's printing shop a few blocks away.
Between 150 and 200 copies are made at night, now known as Dunlop Broadsides.
John Nixon held the first public reading of the document on July 8 in the yard of Independence Hall.
one of them was sent to George Washington on July 6, who read it to his army in New York on July 9. A copy of it arrived in London on August 10.
25 extant Dunlop broadsides are documents of the oldest surviving copy. The original handwritten copy has not been preserved.

Because of their wings and flight, many people don't think they were dinosaurs.

They have scales and claws, they lay eggs, and they walk on their two hind legs like a T-Rex.
All computers in use today are based on manipulating information which is coded as binary numbers.
A binary number can have either 0 or 1 and these numbers are called binary digits or bits in computer terminology.
Intramuscular toxicity is not immediately detectable. It has symptoms that are common, such as vomiting, so it cannot be diagnosed immediately.
The best sign of internal poisoning might be the presence of open containers of medication or toxic household chemicals.
See the label for specific first aid instructions for that particular poison.
The term bug is used by entomologists as a formal term for this group of insects.
This definition is derived from the old analogy with the most adaptable insect reptile that humans depend on.
both the stealth bug and the caterpillar are nest dwellers, which can live in the house of the host without any problems.
n the United States, there are approximately 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), the major neurological disease in young and middle - aged adults.
MS affects the central nervous system, including the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Research has shown that women are twice as likely as men to have MS.
A couple may decide that it is not in their best interest or their child's best interest to have a second child.
These couples may choose to plan for adoption for their child.
In the process of adoption, the parents who give birth give up their parental rights so that another couple can become the child' s parent.
The main goal of science is to figure out how the world works through the scientific method.
though not alone, experiment, and experiment is a test that uses the elimination, questioning, and observation of one or more possible hypotheses to guide scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers paid attention to classical texts and especially to the Bible written in Latin.

As Greek knowledge declined, the West found itself cut off from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
It has been observed in physiology and practice, that the existence of endogenous cycles often depends upon the means and production of biological clocks.
Temporal rhythms that are not just responses to external temporal signals have been recorded for most living things, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological watches are self - powered oscillators that will continue to cycle freely for a period of time even in the absence of external signals.
Hershey and Chase's experiment suggested that DNA was genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phage, or virus, to insert their DNA into a bacterium.
He performed two experiments, either by splicing DNA with radioactive phosphorus or by marking the splicing protein with radioactive sulfur.
The mutations have different effects depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the fragment of the affected genetic material and whether the affected cells are germ - line cells.
Only germ line growths can reach children whereas growths elsewhere can lead to cell death or cancer.
Nature based tourism aims to attract people interested in seeing natural landscapes, including flora and fauna.
Examples of on-site activities include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching and visiting parks and studying information about the ecosystem.
Going to Borneo, taking photos, learning about orangutans is one example.
They leave small towns in their cars to go to work and are passed by others to the workplace they have just left.
In this dynamic transport shuttle everyone is connected in some way, and supports a transport system based on private cars.
iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii
Everyone is connected to society and uses the transport system. Almost everyone complains about the transport system.
In developed countries you rarely hear similar complaints about water quality or the collapse of bridges.
Why does the transport system encourage such complaints? Why do they fall behind every day? Are transport engineers not qualified? Or is there something else that is so bad about the system?
Traffic flow is the study of the activity of individual drivers and vehicles and their interaction with each other between two points.
,,,,....................................................................................................................................
Fortunately, drivers drive within a reasonable consistent range; thus, the traffic flow has some reasonable stability and can be shown roughly mathematically.
To better show traffic flow, relays are made in three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) velocity.
These relationships help in planning, designing and operations of roadway facilities.

Most insects benefit from having their feathers back on their bodies.
This gives them a huge range of small places to hide from predators.
Today, only dragonflies and mayflies can fold their wings back.

Some people thought he was right, but many people believed otherwise; that the solar system, including the sun (and even other stars), seemed to revolve around the earth.
It makes sense, because it doesn't feel like the earth is moving, does it?
Amazon River is the second longest and largest river on Earth. It has more than eight times the water of the second largest river.

20% of the water that flows from our planet's rivers to the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The main Amazon River is 6,387 km long. It is joined by thousands of smaller rivers.

New Kingdom The ancient Egyptians were amazed by the monuments of their predecessors, which were then over a thousand years old.
Vatican City has a population of about 800. It is the smallest independent nation with the smallest population in the world.
Vatican City uses Italian in its legal and official communication.
Italian is also the daily language used by most of the people working in the state, whereas Latin is used in religious ceremonies.
Vatican City is a Roman Catholic city.

Aristotle, the philosopher, proved that everything is made of a mixture of one or four elements. They were earth, water, air and fire.
It was mostly the same as the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although they also established the theory that they transformed into new matter even from what we can see.
Alloys are basically a mixture of two or more metals. Don't forget that there are many elements on the periodic table.
elements such as calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are also metals such as silver and gold.
You can also take alloys which contain small amounts of non-metallic elements like carbon.

Atoms are so incredibly small that they could fit in a dot at the end of a sentence in trillions of numbers.
So, when the pencil came along, it was a good friend to a lot of people.
seriously, as new writing methods have been developed, the pencil has become less and less useful.
People now type messages on computer screens, without having to use a sharpener.
Nobody can imagine what a keyboard would be if something new came along.
The fission bomb works on the principle that it takes energy to hold together a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
like a heavy truck rolling up a mountain, re-splitting the nucleus and extracting some energy from it.
Some molecules have unstable nuclei, which means they tend to break down with little or no shock.
The surface of the moon is made of rocks and dust. The outer layer of the moon is called the crust.
The thickness of the crust at the nearest tip is about 70 km and at the farthest tip it is 100 km.
It is thin under the sea and thick under the highlands.
Because the crust is thin, there would be many mares around. It was easy for lava to move on the surface.
Theory of content focuses on finding what ticks people or what attracts them.
These theories suggest that people had certain needs and/or desires that became embedded in them as they grew up.
These theories look at what things about certain people that tell them to do the things that they want and what things about their environment that tell them to do or not do certain things.
Two popular subject theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs and Herzberg's two facts theory.
In simple terms, when managers start leading their former colleagues there are two types of behaviour that emerge. One end of the spectrum is trying to stay one of those boys (or girls).
Such a manager has trouble making decisions that are not in the public eye, taking disciplinary action, checking work, assigning responsibility, and holding people accountable.
On the other end of the spectrum, someone takes the form of a stranger who feels like he should change everything in the team and make it his own.

This behavior sometimes creates a rift between the leader and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams are set to the same standards of excellence as traditional teams, but with subtle differences.
Virtual team members often act as a point of contact for their immediate physical group.
They have more freedom than traditional team members because their teams can meet in different time zones which may not be understood by their local management.
The existence of a true invisible team (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p109) is also a unique component of a virtual team.

Why would an organisation want to adopt the more time consuming process of setting up a training organisation? One of the objectives of putting the concept of organisational training into practice is innovation.
When all available resources are used effectively in the functional departments of an organisation, both creativity and simplicity become possible.
As a result, the process of an organization working together to overcome a barrier can be an innovative process for the needs of the customer.
Before an organisation can be innovative, leadership must create a culture of innovation as well as share knowledge and organisational learning.
Angel (2006) defines the Continuum approach as a method used to help organizations achieve higher levels of performance.
Neurobiological data provide physical evidence for theoretical approaches to testing cognition, so they limit the scope of research and make it much more precise.
The link between brain dysfunction and behavior supports scientists in research.
It has been known for a long time that various types of brain injury, trauma, injury and tumour affect certain mental behaviours and cause changes in certain mental functions.
With the development of new technologies, we can examine the structure and processes of the brain that have never been seen before.
This provides a lot of information and material to build simulation models, which helps us understand our brain processes.
Although AI has a strong science fiction connotation, it forms a very important branch of computer science, which includes behavioural processing, machine learning and intelligent adaptation.
AI research involves making machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include control, planning and timing, client diagnosis and answering questions, as well as handwriting, speech and facial recognition.
Things have become different disciplines that focus on providing solutions to real life problems.
Today, AI systems are often used in economics, medicine, engineering and military fields, as they are built into many home computer and video game software applications.
Field trips are an important part of any classroom. The teacher will often like to take his students to places where there is no bus trip option.
Technology also offers some solutions along with virtual field trips. Students can view museum artifacts, visit an aquarium, or sit together in their classroom and admire beautiful art.
actually sharing field trips is a great way to reflect on the trip and experience with the class of the future.
Students at Bennett School in North Carolina, for example, design a website about their trip to the state capital every year.The website is redesigned every year, but some of the older versions are put online for use as scrapbooks.
Blogs can also help improve student writing. Where students often start their blogging experience with random grammar and spelling, the presence of an audience usually changes this.
Because students are often the most critical audience, the blog author starts trying to improve the writing to avoid criticism or review.

Blogging is a tool that encourages collaboration, and encourages students to learn better than traditional school days.
Blogs can be used to empower students to be more analytical and discerning; by actively responding to Internet content, students can define their own positions in terms of other people's writing, as well as online their own perspective on a particular topic (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada's charming, bilingual capital and has many art galleries and museums that showcase Canada's past and present.
Niagara Falls is farther south, and Muscogee and other places are scattered with natural beauty.
All these things make Ontario even more important, because foreigners totally consider themselves Canadian.
The large area to the north is sparsely populated and some areas have almost no human population.

The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC, and was used by the Phoenicians, Romans and Merinids as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese razed it and rebuilt it as Casa Branca and then abandoned it after the earthquake in 1755.
The Sultan of Morocco rebuilt the city as Daru l - Badia and the Spanish traders who had established trading posts there named it Casablanca.

Goma, Rwanda is a tourist town in the Democratic Republic of the Congo just to the east.
In 2002 Goma was destroyed by lava from the Nyiragongo volcano, which buried most of the city streets, especially the middle part of the city.

The town is home to some of the cheapest mountain gorilla trekking in Africa as well as a base for climbing the Nyiragongo volcano.

timbaktū has come to be used as a metaphor for distant land because of its relative proximity.
Timbuktu
1990, the desert was added to the list of World Heritage Sites in Danger.
This was a major stopover during Henry Louis' PBS Gates, the wonder of the African world.
This city is different from the rest of the country because it looks like an Arab city rather than an African city.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the north-east of South Africa, bordering Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north and the Crocodile River to the south.
The park covers 19,500 square kilometres and has 14 different eco zones, each with its own unique wildlife.
It is one of the main attractions of South Africa and has been designated as the flagship of South African National Parks (SANParks).
All South African National Parks as well as the park charge for daily conservation and entrance.
It might be useful to buy a wild card because it will allow you to visit selected South African parks or all of South Africa's national parks.
Hong Kong Island gives its name to the territory of Hong Kong and is the place that many tourists consider to be the main focal point.
The parade of buildings that have made Hong Kong's skyline look like a sparkling bar chart has made Victoria Harbor's waterfront worth seeing.
To get the best view of Hong Kong, leave the island and head opposite the Kowloon Waterfront.
Hong Kong Island is largely urbanised along the north coast on reclaimed land.
This is where the British colonists built their own, so if you're looking for evidence of this place's colonial past, this is a good place.
Sundarbans are the largest coastal mangrove area in the world, extending 80 km (50 mi) from the coast to the Bangladeshi and Indian highlands.
Sundarbans are a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The part of the forest that is in India is called Sundarbans National Park.
,,,......................................................................................................................................
Sundarbans is spread over 3,850 sq km, of which about one third is water - marshy area.
Since 1966 Sundarbans has been a wildlife sanctuary and according to one estimate there are now about 400 Royal Bengal Tigers and about 30,000 Cheetahs in the area.
Buses run from the Inter - District Bus Station (which is across the river) throughout the day, although most, especially those heading east and Jakarta/Bumtang, leave between 06:30 and 07:30 am.
As inter - district buses are often full, it is advisable to buy tickets a few days in advance.

Shared taxis are a quick and comfortable means to get to nearby places like Paro (Nu 150) and Punakha (Nu 200).
Oiapoque River Bridge is a cable stayed bridge connecting the Oiapoque River to the cities of Oiapoque, Brazil and Saint-Georges de Oiapoque, French Guiana.
Both towers are 83 m high, 378 m long and 3.50 m wide with two lanes.
The vertical clearance below the bridge is 15 m. Construction was completed in August 2011, it was not opened to traffic until March 2017.
