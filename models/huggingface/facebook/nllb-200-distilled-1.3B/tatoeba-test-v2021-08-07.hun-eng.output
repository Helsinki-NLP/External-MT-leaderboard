I was resting.
I remember you both.
I remember that, too.
I remember the day we first met.
I remember Tom wearing a brown hat.
I reminded him of his duty.
I respect Tom.
I'm retiring in four years.
I risked my ass for you.
First, iron these shirts.
I can run faster than you.
I run five miles a day.
I'm going to run.
I've got the horses in the saddle, sir.
I said that, but I didn't mean it.
I told you this wasn't gonna work.
I said no.
I thanked him.
I just sat there and stared.
I sat next to him.
I sat down to think.
I sat down and thought.
I was sitting next to the driver.

I fell asleep, I was late for school.
I slept for nine hours.
I slept with my boss.

Monday's good?
Do you understand me?
I clicked a picture.
I snuck into the house.
I broke into the house.
I was just blowing it.
Is that good?
Wasn't it enough for you to ruin my life?
Isn't that a little upsetting?
I sold it this afternoon.
I get sad sometimes.
Sometimes my stomach hurts.
I sleep sometimes.

I still don't understand a word.
I still don't know why you did it.
I still have plenty of time to have fun.
There's one or two more things to put in the suitcase.
I have to go to breakfast.
I still think it's the best choice.
Is Tom a Christian?
Does Tom cook well?

I stopped by your place today, but you weren't home.
I stopped talking.
I study for about two hours every day.
I study hard at school.
I suggest you talk to Mary.
I suggest you talk to Tom.
I assume you're packed and ready to go.
I must have heard that voice somewhere before.
I swear I'll make it up to you.
I swim regularly.
I swim two and a half kilometers a day.
Is your daughter feeling better?
Are you doing dangerous work?
Is your mother home?
Is your mom home?
There's no doubt about it.
It affects everyone.
It's not over until we're over it.
I'll take his place.
I take the train to work every day.
I talked to Tom a couple of times.
It's up to you.
It came out of nowhere.
You'd be better off with your sister.
It goes along with the love I feel for you.
It cost a lot more than I expected.
This one costs two euros.
He may have a problem.
It's going to be expensive.
It would be a shame to see all that work go to waste.
She's clearly freaked out.
It's not broken.
I wasn't sick.
That didn't help much.
It's not stopped snowing.
It hasn't stopped snowing.
I don't care if you come.
He's not doing anything!
It doesn't matter who started it or why.
It doesn't seem so complicated anymore.
That doesn't seem right.
I teach Chinese.
It's like it was poured on me.
I slowly realized I had misunderstood him.
It was snowing the other day.
Thank you for coming.
Thank you for your trust in me.
It happened early last week.
This just happened on our wedding day, honey.
There must be a reason for that.
It just happened.
This happened when he was out.
It's happened to me a few times.
It happens sometimes.
It happens to everybody.
It doesn't taste good.
It has its own value.
It's been raining since Tuesday.
I think every fat person should be on a diet.
I think everyone is hungry.
I don't think he can help you.
I think you'll get along with your neighbors.
I find your novel boring.
I think I dropped some film.
I think I can do it.
I don't think I could kill.
I don't think I can kill.
I don't think I understand you.
I feel better.
I think I have the answer.
I think I'll buy it for Tom.
I think I'm going to die.
I think I'm starting to lose my head.
I think I'm ready to change.
I think I need more time.
I feel like I saw a rat.
I think I still have time to do that before Tom gets here.
I think it's better this way.
I think it's fair.
It's very unlikely, in my opinion, that you'll be able to do it yourself.
I think he's going to.
I think it's time for a career change.
I feel like it's time to take a break.
I think that's unfair.
I think you are.
I think Tom was the one who helped Mary.
I think you'd better leave now.
I think my idea is better.
I think my neighbor might have died.
I think you'll get along with your neighbors.
I think there's someone at the door.
I think something's wrong.
I think spiders are cute.
I think he's home right now.
I think my idea is better.
I think he's coming.
I think Tom said something else.
I think we should forget about it.
I think that explains everything.
I think, therefore I drink.
I think, therefore I exist.
I think there's no point in trying to convince him.
I think you did a great job.
I guess that's exactly what Tom wants.
I don't think that's going to be enough.
I think this medicine will do you good.
I think time will solve this problem.
I think Tom's been there before.
I think Tom is exciting.
I think Tom is still unemployed.
I think Tom must be hungry.
I think Tom might be older than me.
I think Tom needs more.
I think Tom wants to do it tomorrow.
I think Tom will be able to help.
I think Tom is going to win.
I think we can handle it.
I think we should be patient.
I think we're going the wrong way somewhere.
I think we should be careful.
I think we're safe now.
I guess you're all screwed now.
I think you've dialed the wrong number.
I think you know him.
I think you know the rules.
I think you know what Tom's girlfriend's name is.
I think you'll approve.
I think you look great.
I think you'd like it.
I think you've got it all wrong.
I think you should go in person.
I think you're the most beautiful girl I've ever seen.
I think you're the only one who needs help.
I think you're doing a very good job.
I think you smell good.
I feel like you weren't convincing enough.
I guess you were right.
I was thinking about Tom.
I thought if we went out to eat, it would cheer him up.
I thought I could trust you.
I thought I was going to go with him.
I thought I knew him.
I thought it might be worth something.
I thought I knew what I wanted.
I thought my head was gonna explode.
I've been thinking about my future.
I thought it was a good idea to put the key under the towel, but it turned out not to be.
I thought Tom was still living in Boston.
I thought you trusted me.
I thought Tom was coming.
I thought Tom was still at home.
I thought you were him.
I threatened to kill the neighbor.
That hurts!
That hurts.
I'm under the influence.
It was a big influence on me.
This is a dangerous situation.
This is a historical play.
It's hard to put into practice what we talked about.
It's hard to please everyone.
It's hard to please everybody.
I have my doubts about it working.
It's getting very late.
He's gone. He was gone.
It's half an hour past midnight.
Some people are hard to understand.
It's high time you started a new business.
It is important to promote our language in every possible way.
It's basically your fault.
It's in the kitchen.
That's wonderful.
It's noon.
This is my bedroom.
We have to prepare for the future.
You need a good rest.
It's never too late to learn.
It's good to see you again.
It's not easy to solve the problem.
The smoke detector can't be turned off.
This is not the best solution.
This is not the right way.
It's no exaggeration to say he's a genius.
It's not a secret.
I'm not the one Tom has a problem with.
It's not that expensive.
This isn't the 19th century.
This isn't the 19th century.
It's not working.
Maybe he's lying to me.
It's not proper to talk with your mouth full.
It's snowing.
It's still moving.
Wow, the weather is really bad today.
It's fucking expensive.
It's 30 meters long.
It's time to go to bed.
It's too easy for him.
It's up to you.
That's useful information.
It's hot at night.
It is very important to wash your hands thoroughly after changing the baby's diaper.
It just didn't work.
It's going to be dangerous.
It'll be dark when we get home.
It'll be ready when it's ready.
It'll be ready when you need it.
It'll take a while to get used to wearing glasses.
It'll wear off soon.
It'll work if I switch the polarities.
It looks bigger as a result.
It looks good.
I guess I'm not needed here.
You could use a shave.
You don't seem to be feeling very well here.
You seem to have thought of everything.
It makes me sad.
That's what matters.
That could be a long time.
This could be a trap.
This could save your life.
Maybe we'd enjoy trying it.
I might be late.
I need to wash it.
It's got to mean something.
It must have been love.
It was definitely stolen.
It needs to be fixed.
It never existed.
It never should have happened.
I lied to her even though I didn't want to.
I told him I'd do my best.
I told him to come.
I told Tom not to give up.
I told Tom where I bought my bike.
I told you, but you wouldn't listen.
I told you, I'm fine.
I told you not to walk.
I told you three weeks ago.
I told you you'd like Tom.
I have a question for you.
I took a long bath.
I was in the tub for a long time.
I've arranged it.
I took Route 58.
I was sure you were on our side.
I took my cat to the vet yesterday.
I took off my shoes.
I totally forgot.
It'd probably be cheaper somewhere else.
It stopped raining yesterday morning.
It rained yesterday.
It rains a lot.
I train two hours a day.
I've been all over Russia.
I've been all over the United States.
It actually works.
This is really sad.
I tried everything to keep her alive.
I tried to forget.
I tried to help Tom.
I'd trust him with my life.
I'm trying to keep up with you.
I'm trying to get my head together.
That's a nice flag.
He's a big cat with a big fur coat.
It's a little early for a drink, isn't it?
That's a boring word.
This is a delicate situation.
This is a dictionary.
It's a good plan, on paper.
It's a gray stone building.
It's a guard dog.
It's a half hour to lunch.
It's a hot day.
This is a kitchen knife.
It's completely dark outside.
This is all mine.
It's all right.
That's nice and good in theory, but will it work in practice?
This is all your fault.
It's already 7:00.
It's already underway.
It's already ten o'clock at night.
One of my dreams was to live by a stream.
It's always the same tune.
It's an environmental disaster.
It's a nasty business, Watson, a nasty, dangerous business, and the more I see it, the less I like it.
What a pity.
I'm sorry I was late.
It's a shame that Tom is leaving.
That's a pretty big stick.
This is terrible news.
It's freezing cold.
It's as much an art as it is a science.
That's in the past.
She's at school.
It's a very dangerous sport, where even a small mistake can lead to serious injury.
It's a very old book.
It's a waste of money.
That's a weird question.
This is awful.
It's been a crazy week.
It's been a long day.
It's been an amazing journey.
It's been a long day.
It's been a rough day.
This has happened before.
It wasn't just any week.
It's been two years since he left.
That's better.
It's better to water the garden at night.
It's hot.
It's fire.
It's cheaper to take the bus.
That's Chinese to me.
It's closed on Sundays.
It's closed on Sundays.
It's closed on Sunday.
It's closed on Sunday.
It's cold in here.
It's cold, I'm all cold.
It's cold out.
Why don't you get yourself a sweater?
It's well known that the bear likes honey.
It doesn't matter if Tom did it or not.
It's perfectly normal.
It's all right now.
It's dangerous in here.
It's deep in here.
This is delicious.
It's all set.
It's easier to start than to stop.
It's easy to be brave from a distance.
It's easy to understand why Tom doesn't like Mary.
It seemed like an eternity to me.
It seemed like the bus was late.
That sounds completely ridiculous.
It seems like only yesterday that we went to school together.
It seems nothing has changed.
He looks really weird.
It seems so.
It seems he's lying.
Tom doesn't seem to be in a hurry.
It's like you don't want this to work out for me.
It seems to me you're honest.
It seems to me you're wrong.
Looks like we're having an extraordinary guest.
It's embarrassing to be late for a date.
That's exactly what they want.
It's expensive.
It's fair to pay them the same for the same work.
It's not even close to perfect.
It's far from ideal.
This is yours.
You know, it's funny.
He's going crazy.
It's getting serious.
It's going to be a rough winter.
It's not gonna be easy.
It's good luck to see a shooting star.
It's good to be gay.
It's good for studying.
It's great you could come.
That's so good, you'll laugh.
It's hard not to think so.
It's hard to believe it's been clear and sunny all this time.
It's hard to describe.
It's hard to find a bench in this town to sleep on.
It's hard to put into words.
It's hard to put into words.
It's hard to steal from a thief.
It's a very beautiful place.
His head is disproportionately large.
It's high.
The kids should be in bed.
Stop wasting money.
It's warmer than usual tonight.
It's against the law.
This is important.
It's important that parents be on the same side when it comes to raising children.
It's important to help people in trouble.
It's impossible for me.
You're gonna have to drown in here.
You can't breathe in here.
It's impossible to live up to your expectations.
It's impossible to meet your terms.
You never know what tomorrow will bring.
It's amazing, you know?
It's inevitable, you know.
That is inspiring.
It's just a feeling.
Just a little further.
It's only a matter of time before Tom gets into trouble again.
It's just a phone.
I just don't want to die today.
It's a little heavy.
That's pretty relevant.
It's really nice of you to take me home.
That's nice of you to say.
It's getting late.
Today's the day for laundry.
It's like an underwater field with turtles and rays and sharks like flying creatures above.
This one's closed.
It's me again.
It's me again, Tom.
It's me!
That's me, you know.
It's pathetic the way he lives.
It's too cold to swim.
That's my horse.
This is my life!
This is my life!
That's my problem.
This is my suitcase.
I'm on my way.
It's never too late to be what you could have been.
It's none of your business.
That's not a bad idea.
This isn't a bank.
It's not as loud as it sounds.
It's not complicated at all.
That's not enough.
That's not gonna happen.
It's not your job to change Egypt.
That's not mine.
It's not my fault.
It's not negotiable.
It's not that far.
It's not that simple.
This isn't the 19th century.
This isn't the 19th century.
It's not what it looks like.
It's not what you do, it's how you do it.
It's not worth complaining about.
I wasn't talking to you.
I wasn't talking to you.
I didn't say you.
There's no point in confessing to a priest if you're not repentant.
There's no point in mourning the past.
It's snowing.
It's obviously broken.
It's clearly not possible.
Obviously weird.
It's obviously very painful.
It's okay if some people think I'm a peasant.
It's okay to be gay.
Three months have passed, and Tom says he speaks French fluently. Well, he's at the top of his stupidity. What's the top? Dunning-Kruger effect.
It's only three days.
It's across the park.
That sounds good.
It's over, right?
It's over now.
This is personal.
It's pouring like a puddle.
He spread his wings.
It's pretty amazing.
It's pretty convincing.
It's pretty simple.
It is quite obvious that the purpose of these misanthropic theories is to belittle the working class, to absolve imperialism of responsibility for the bloody wars it foments, and to destroy the seed of the idea that endless wars are caused by man's innate aggressive tendencies.
It's very urgent.
It's raining in my heart.
There are few large gardens in Japan.
It's real, right?
That's a really big number.
It's right there.
It's rude to ask someone how much they make.
They say Czech girls are beautiful.
They say they're leaving Tokyo soon.
Shit, man.
It's just disgusting.
It's snowing in here.
It's snowing in Boston right now.
It's so nice to be home.
It's still moving.
This is suicide.
It's technically possible.
This is the best book I've ever read.
It's the least I can do.
It's theoretically possible.
It's the same for everyone.
It's the same old problem.
That's a question that needs to be answered.
It's time to get our tents.
It's time to get out of here.
It's time to go.
It's time to go.
It's time to fix the problem.
I should have my hair cut.
It's time to rest.
It's time to tell the whole truth.
It's high time we did something about this.
Tom's birthday is today.
It's Tom's decision.
Tom's word is against Mary's.
It's too dark to play ball.
It's very dear to me.
It's too hot for that now.
It's too late for grief.
It's too late to worry about that.
It's typical autumn weather.
A cold sucks.
It's ugly, it's yellow, it's creaky, and it doesn't match anything, but at least they don't run over in the dark.
It's under the table.
Maybe he's not as stupid as you think.
It's unlikely anything serious is going to happen.
It's up to them now.
It's up to you whether we go there or not.
She's very attractive.
It's really boring.
It's very cold in this room, isn't it?
It's very disturbing.
It's a lot of fun.
It's expensive to live here.
That's very kind of you.
It's very white.
It's hot.
That was the deal.
It's your only chance.
It takes about 10,000 hours of study to master a language thoroughly.
You have to be brave to succeed.
It took me almost three years to build my house.
It took me almost three years to build my house.
It came at everyone unexpectedly.
It took exactly an hour.
It took me a long time to write this book.
It took me over a month to recover from the cold.
It took Tom a long time to choose a pair of shoes.
It took a long time, but I finally found it.
I went into an alley.
I've been looking through it.
I'm turning left.
It was a beautiful summer day.
It was a difficult time.
It was a friendly competition.
It was a mistake to do that.
It was a good party.
It was a pitch-black night.
It was a real challenge.
That was a stupid question.
It was a stupid idea.
It was a tragic accident.
It was really good food.
It was a waste of time for all of us.
It was awfully weird.
It was a beautiful day.
It was a wonderful evening.
It was chaotic.
It was definitely a lot of fun.
We had a good time last night.
It was hard at first.
It was hopeless.
It was hot and wet.
It was hot and humid.
It was just a field trip.
It was just too easy.
I told you.
I wanted this.
It was almost pitch black.
It wasn't long before John had an idea: John always knew a way out of seemingly hopeless situations.
It wasn't a very interesting novel.
It wasn't easy for me.
