United Nations says there is no military solution in Syria
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said his response to Russia’s military support for Syria is that “there is no military solution” to the conflict that has lasted for five years and more weapons would only exacerbate the violence and suffering of millions of people.
The UN chief once again called on all parties, including the divided UN Security Council, to unite and support negotiations to find a political solution.
Ban said in a conference on Wednesday that he plans to meet this month with foreign ministers from five countries permanently present in the council - the US, Russia, China, England and France - on the ministerial session of the General Assembly to discuss Syria.
Ban expressed regret that divisions in the council and between the Syrian people and regional powers “have made this situation unsolvable.”
Ban urged the five permanent members to show solidarity and unity when they managed to reach an agreement on Iran’s nuclear weapons, thereby addressing the crisis in Syria.
8 figures from polls that show that Donald Trump has real chances
Some have tried to label him a “flip-flop” politician.
Others called it a joke.
Others are waiting for the implosion.
But no matter how some Republicans are trying to crush Donald Trump from the top of the polls, it hasn’t worked (yet).
Ten of the last 11 national polls have shown that Donald Trump is leading with a two-digit percentage and some voices are starting to seriously wonder what this means for the real estate mogul’s appointment odds.
Of course, it is still premature.
Nothing of this says Trump will win the Republican nomination race.
Pundits shows that in the same period of 2011, Rick Perry's advance made Herman Cain's place in polls, but none of them won in any state in the nomination race.
And the reasons why they would struggle hard in general elections are numerous.
But outside groups like Jeb Bush’s Super PAC and the conservative economic group Club for Growth admit Trump’s power and start supporting him with money.
Below are some figures from recent surveys that suggest that the real estate mogul is not just a temporary one:
The figures indicating support for Trump have turned 180 degrees.
Even before Donald Trump announced his candidacy in mid-June, a Monmouth University poll showed that only two out of ten Republicans had a positive opinion about the real estate mogul.
By mid-July, the percentage had risen to 40 percent.
At the beginning of August, it was 52%.
At present, six out of ten Republicans have a favorable opinion of Donald Trump.
Approximately three out of ten say they have a negative opinion.
These figures remain.
A poll conducted last week by Quinnipiac in Iowa concluded that 60% of Republicans in the region have a favorable opinion about Trump.
Two-thirds of GOP voters would be happy if Trump won the race for nomination.
In a CNN/ORC poll last week, 67 percent of Republicans said they would be “enthusiastic” or “grateful” if Trump won the nomination.
Only two out of ten say they would be “irritated” if Trump won the nomination race.
Ben Carson alone generates roughly the same level of enthusiasm as Trump (43% say they would be “enthusiastic” versus 40% who say the same about Trump).
The closest in terms of enthusiasm?
Marco Rubio with 21 percent.
On the other hand, 47 percent of Republican voters say they would be “unhappy” or “irritated” if Jeb Bush won the nomination.
Most Republicans don’t see Trump’s temperament as a problem.
While Donald Trump has been heavily criticized for his insults and bombastic style, 52 percent of Republican voters nationwide believe the real estate mogul has the right temper to be president, according to a poll conducted Monday by ABC News/Washington Post.
We find the same figures in Iowa, where 52% of Republicans still believe Trump has the right personality to be the leader, according to a Quinnipiac poll last week.
However, 44 percent say they don’t have the personality to act effectively, and six out of 10 independent respondents say their temperament doesn’t look for in the White House, according to ABC/Post.
Republican voters are getting used to the idea.
When they take the attitude of intellectuals, Republican voters believe Trump is authentic.
According to a poll conducted last week by CNN/ORC, when asked who has the most chances of winning the race for GOP nomination, four out of 10 said Trump.
The situation changed from late July, when four out of 10 would have bet on Jeb Bush.
Complete information: In the past, GOP voters did not read the future very well.
In the same period of the last election, four out of ten Republicans chose Rick Perry in the race for nomination, up from just 28 percent for Mitt Romney.
But these figures show that most GOP voters consider Trump’s campaign plausible.
Even if the Republicans or replied toward another candidate. Trump is still at the forefront of all.
Some voices say the divided situation will likely contribute to Trump’s victory, while support against Trump will split into more than twelve candidates.
But a poll conducted in early September by the University of Monmouth shows that in the hypothetical situation of a collaboration between Trump and most other Republican candidates, Trump will almost always benefit from majority support.
Trump is 13 points away from Carly Fiorina, 14 points from Marco Rubio, 15 points from Walker, 19 points from Jeb Bush and finally 33 points from Rand Paul, John Kasich and Chris Christie.
He is almost equal to Ted Cruz.
The only candidate to win?
Ben Carson would beat the businessman by 19 points in a hypothetical one-on-one confrontation.
Most Donald Trump supporters say they have made a decision.
A new poll conducted by CBS/NYT on Tuesday shows that more than half of voters who support Trump say they don’t change their vote.
Obviously, a lot can happen in this regard and no one can say that they will never change their mind.
46% say they leave the door open to the possibility of changing their choice.
However, Trump’s most important opponent is currently neurosurgeon Ben Carson, but he’s twice as likely as voters who claim to have decided to vote for Trump.
Six out of ten Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration.
Since Donald Trump called Mexican immigrants “rape” in his campaign opening speech two months ago, immigration has been the central theme in the 2016 campaign.
Some are concerned that Trump’s bombastic style will lead to a split between leading Hispanic voters and the Republican Party and will undermine rebranding efforts.
But according to a poll conducted by ABC/Post on Monday, six out of ten Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration.
So it seems that as long as the immigration issue remains in the light of the light, Doland Trump will remain the same.
The frustration with the authorities is reaching new heights.
Donald Trump and Ben Carson are now supported by half of Republican voters, largely due to their outsider status.
According to a poll conducted by ABC/Post on Monday, six out of 10 Republicans say they prefer a political outsider to someone with experience in government.
People are also angry at the authorities in Washington.
A poll conducted two weeks ago in Iowa by Des Moines Register/Bloomberg shows that three out of four Republicans in Iowa are frustrated with the performance of the Republicans in COngres, with 54% declaring themselves “unhappy” and 21% “nervous at peak.”
Jeremy Corbyn makes his debut at Prime Minister's Questions
Since his election, Mr. Corbyn's debut at PMQs has been long awaited
New Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn will later make his debut at Prime Minister's Questions, confronting David Cameron for the first time.
Mr Corbyn will address the first of the six questions he is entitled to answer shortly after lunch; his performance will likely be closely reviewed by the media and Labour MPs.
During his weekly appearances, he called for “less theatre and more facts.”
He also said that he could give up some participations and that he would give it to his colleagues.
The confrontation will be Mr Corbyn's first parliamentary test as leader, coming after he called a "ghost cabinet" and after his speech on Tuesday at the annual TUC congress.
Meanwhile, Labour’s leader’s decision to keep silent on his national anthem at a ceremony on Tuesday for the 75th anniversary of the Battle of England has attracted criticism from conservative lawmakers and held the front page of the newspapers.
Mr. Corbyn's decision not to sing the national anthem has attracted attention
A spokesman for Mr Corbyn said he had "respectfully kept silence" and recognized "the heroism of the British Air Force in the Battle of England."
But a member of Mr Corbyn’s ghost cabinet, Owen Smith, told the BBC’s Two’s Newsnight that he would have recommended Labour leader sing the national anthem “regardless” of his belief that the monarchy should be abolished.
Around twelve ministers in the ghost cabinet refused to be part of Mr Corbyn's leadership team, arguing for differences in economic, defence and foreign affairs, while less than a sixth of the parliamentary party supported him as leader.
BBC political correspondent Robin Brant says political differences “accumulate” in the Labour Party after Mr. Corbyn’s appointment regarding his position towards the European Union and the limit of benefits.
Mr. Corbyn said at the TUC conference that the Labour Party will bring changes that will completely eliminate the idea of limitation.
A few hours later, Mr. Smith, Minister of Labor and Pensions, said the party was “very clear” in its exclusive opposition to the government’s plans to reduce the “cap” level from £26,000 to £23,000.
Mr Corbyn will be the fifth Labour leader David Cameron has faced on the podium in the last decade since he took over the Conservative Party.
The Labour leader, who has promised a different approach to politics, says he has ideas “from external sources” for questions to ask Cameron and has received over 30,000 suggestions.
MEP Islington North stated that PMQs involve too high levels of confrontation and that it will refrain from replicas and attacks, committing instead to focus on serious issues such as poverty, inequality and the challenges facing young people.
Mr. Corbyn said Finance Minister Angela Eagle will take his place at PMQs when he can’t attend – for example when Mr. Cameron is traveling abroad.
He also expressed the idea that he would allow other colleagues to take the word occasionally, saying that he had approached House Speaker John Bercow to discuss this issue.
In 2005, when he took over, Mr Cameron said he wanted to give up the “Punch and Judy” political style often associated with PMQs but admitted a few years later that he failed in his move.
Since its first broadcast in 1990, PMQs has been considered a key barometer of a leader’s reasoning, how he runs the House of Representatives, and his position among fellow parliamentarians, although critics claim it has become a caricature and needs profound reform.
“Cadre in Joburg”: Homeless youths benefit from photography classes
It’s hard to be a homeless man in Johannesburg.
But a group of people who lived on the streets as a child found a way to learn a profession and make a living.
“I was shot in Joburg” is a non-profit studio that teaches homeless young people to take pictures of the areas where they live and make money from it.
BBC News met with one of the first graduates of the project.
JD Sports chief says higher wages could hurt expansion
JD Sports President Peter Cowgill says a minimum wage increase in the UK could mean “more purchasing power in the pockets of potential consumers.”
However, it is unlikely that that purchasing power will exceed the higher labor costs within the firm, he says.
The costs could impact JD Sports’ expansion plans, he added, which could mean fewer new jobs.
Thanasi Kokkinakis supported by Australian Tennis President Steve Healy
Thanasi Kokkinakis would deserve to be praised and not criticized for his behavior.
Thanasi Kokkinakis was a collateral victim in the “storm” created around his friend Nick Kyrgios, and his behavior deserves more words of praise than criticism, according to Tennis Australia president Steve Healy.
Kokkinakis, the younger part of the talented duo often referred to as “Special Ks,” was unpleasantly drawn into the spotlight by the scandalous defeat Kyrgios had against Stan Wawrinka at the Montreal Masters Tour.
In a crunchy qualifying match played shortly thereafter in Cincinnati, the chair referee had to intervene twice to separate Kokkinakis and his opponent Ryan Harrison, after which Harrison said: "Wawrinka should have grounded Kyrgios, and I should have grounded this boy."
Although he was last seen making a dust rocket after having muscle cramps and missing a possible US Open tournament, angry at Richard Gasquet, Kokkinakis was firmly defended by Healy.
The teenager is currently in Glasgow, where he is battling Sam Groth for second place in the individual, after Bernard Tomic in the Davis Cup semi-final against England.
“One thing I feel strongly about is that, in my opinion, Thanasi has been drawn a bit into the conflict,” Healy said.
The truth is he broke a rocket when he lost because he accused cramps in the US, but he’s not the first player to break a rocket out of frustration to himself and I know Thanasi well enough to know he’t be proud of it.
But let’s be serious, he did extremely well in rather challenging situations in the U.S. with Harrison and so on and I think he deserves a lot of trust.
He has a great team, he has a great family and I think he has been treated unfairly.
He is a very mature 19-year-old, he works hard and has integrated into the team, he has had no conflict with other players, he is very respected in the dressing room, he trains hard, he is in excellent shape, he is a very balanced and mature young man and I think he deserves to be judged solely on the basis of his qualities and flaws.
Healy also supported the decision not to consider Kyrgios for the major draw match, which starts on Friday, and described the “joint decision” as the most suitable for all, but supported the long-term Canberra player’s return to the team.
“First of all, we want the team to focus entirely on the draw and not think at all about the controversy around [Kyrgios],” Healy said.
And I think Nick has climbed very quickly, as people like Federer and Murray have said, he grows up under the eyes of the public and has made some terrible mistakes and deserves to be criticized, but we try to support him, we try to help him understand the consequences of his actions and I think he needs a time when he is not in the center of attention to be able to reflect, which is good for both the team and for him.
Elections 2016: Hillary Clinton's advantage over Bernie Sanders halved in national polls
Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton still has a two-digit advantage in the Democratic race for the national candidacy, but Senator Bernie Sanders wins ground.
Clinton is now backed by 47 percent of Democratic voters (down from 58 percent), while Sanders is second with 27 percent (up from 17 percent).
Vice President Joe Biden, who has not yet announced whether he will run for president, is supported by 15% of Democratic voters.
At least five months before the primary elections begin, most Democratic voters say it’s too early to say they’ve decided on the candidate they’re going to support.
But Clinton’s supporters are stronger in their choice than the supporters of other candidates.
Compared to the CBS news poll last month, Clinton lost ground in a number of demographic groups, while Sanders gained a few percent.
Clinton retains the advantage among women and moderates, but the advantage has diminished.
The support among the men has declined considerably and Sanders is only 5 points away.
Clinton’s advantage over Democratic voters under the age of 50 has evaporated, being now equal to Sanders.
However, Clinton is still at an advantage among elderly voters.
Last month, Clinton was two-digit ahead of Sanders among the liberals, but Sanders now has a slight five-point edge in that group.
Approximately half of Democratic voters nationally say they would enthusiastically support Clinton if she were elected to run on behalf of the party.
A quarter would support it somewhat reservedly and another 15% would support it just because it represents the party.
Six percent would not support it.
Per not surprisingly, the likelihood that Clinton’s current supporters are enthusiastic about her choice is high.
Opinions are more mixed among those who don’t currently support Clinton – only about a quarter would enthusiastically support her.
While 48 percent of Democratic voters say they would enthusiastically support Clinton, the number of Republican voters who say the same about top-ranked Donald Trump (35 percent) is lower.
When Clinton supporters are asked an open question about why they would like her to win the race, the majority answer is that she has the appropriate experience (16%), followed by the fact that the time has come for a woman to be president (13%) and that she is the best candidate for that position (10%).
Clinton’s supporters also mention her association with Bill Clinton (9%).
The agreement on these aspects and eligibility shall also be mentioned.
Given that the Vice-President is considering a possible presidential candidacy, 57% of Democratic voters would like to see him in the race — although one-third think they should not run.
When asked about the second option for the party's representative, Democratic voters nominate Biden for the majority.
Of Clinton’s supporters, more than half say Biden would be the second option, well ahead of Sanders.
If Biden decides not to run for the Democratic race, Hillary Clinton's advantage over Sanders increases, from 20 points with Biden in the race to 30 points if he does not run.
55% of Democratic voters consider Clinton the most likely candidate to win the general election, but the figure dropped from 78% last month.
Biden is far from second, but the percentage that says he is the most eligible has increased.
However, when asked what is most important to an elected candidate, Democratic voters prefer issues to eligibility.
Like last month, no Democratic candidate or potential candidate is considered by these voters to be unacceptable as a party representative in the presidential race.
Democratic candidates or prospective candidates do well with regard to a few key features over their party’s primary voters.
Most voters consider Clinton, Sanders, and Biden to be trustworthy and have strong leadership qualities.
Biden is seen best of all three in terms of integrity, while Clinton’s strength is leadership.
30% of Democratic voters do not believe that Clinton is integrated and trustworthy, twice as many as those who say so about Sanders (15%), but 27% do not have an opinion about him in this regard.
Democratic voters also generally believe the three, Clinton, Sanders and Biden, have the same ideologies as them.
About a quarter of Democratic voters have no opinion about Sanders.
As questions persist about Hillary Clinton’s use of a personal email address and a server while she was Secretary of State, most Democratic voters are pleased with her explanation on the subject and say it hasn’t affected their general opinion of the candidate.
But things are different among the American public.
Half of Americans are now dissatisfied with her explanation, while only a third are satisfied.
Public opinion was divided on the subject in March, shortly after the matter emerged.
Most Americans say the email controversy hasn’t affected their general opinion about Clinton, although 36% say they’ve changed their minds in a negative way.
Mostly Republicans, more than six out of ten, say they have changed their minds about Clinton in a negative way.
Although Democratic voters consider Clinton to be integrated and trustworthy, this still raises concerns among voters in general: only 32% consider her integrated and trustworthy, with 8% fewer than last month and 15% fewer than in May.
62% of voters do not consider it integral and trustworthy.
At the same time, 55% of national voters do not consider Trump to be integrated and trustworthy.
However, both Clinton and Trump have white balls for leadership.
Of the six candidates rated, Biden, Carson and Bush rank first in terms of integrity.
The number of those who consider Sanders integral is higher than those who disagree, but, as with Carson, many do not have an opinion about him.
The error margin for the sample of 351 Democratic primary voters is 6 percentage points.
Five Brotherhood Members Arrested for Murder of Year 1 Student at Baruch Faculty
Nearly two years after a college student lost his life during an initiation ritual in the Pocono Mountains in Pennsylvania, five people were charged with murder.
Members of the Pi Delta Psi Brotherhood at New York's Baruch College brutally attacked Chun "Michael" Deng during an initiation ritual in September 2013 and postponed taking him to the hospital, which contributed to his death, according to police statements.
Official sources say the victim was tied to the eyes, a 14kg backpack full of sand was put on her back, and she was repeatedly struck as she tried to head toward a target on frozen ground.
Mr. Deng accused of headaches after which he lost consciousness.
Members of the Pi Delta Psi brotherhood did not call the emergency number after he fainted and claim to have waited an hour before taking him to the hospital, police said.
But they found time to change Deng's clothes, search for his symptoms on Google, and contact Andy Meng, the national brotherhood's president, to ask for advice, police chief Chris Wagner told a news conference.
“At this point, the members began to hide their personal possessions and practically put the good of the brotherhood before the good of Michael Deng,” Wagner said.
He could not be resurrected and died the next morning.
According to an autopsy report, Deng suffered repeated injuries to the head, trunk and thighs.
“Too many families have been devastated by the brotherhood rituals, since 1970 at least one student has died each year because of the rituals,” Douglas Fierberg, Deng’s family’s lawyer, said in a statement.
The brothers and their members must be held accountable and this measure taken by the authorities is important.
The Grand Jury of Monroe County recommended that the first five members be charged with murder of the third degree.
Thirty-two other members of the Brotherhood, including Mr Meng, will also be charged with insult and complicity in the murder.
“We want to hold not only the people involved accountable, but if there is an organization that has authorized the brotherhood, officially or informally, we will also hold it accountable,” Wagner said at a news conference on Tuesday.
The Baruch Faculty banned the brotherhood and the National Brotherhood withdrew its affiliation with the local representation.
This Is What Will Happen When the Federal Reserve Raises the Interest Rate
Interest rates will rise and the bull market will stumble, bond yields will rise and the economy will go into recession.
That we know.
What we do not know is how long it will happen and how long it will last.
In economics, history offers little clue about framing over time.
After the first rate hike, the recession occurred in just 11 months and lasted 86 months.
The Federal Reserve’s aggressiveness to raise interest rates is often, though not always, a determining factor in how the economy and financial assets respond.
That’s why U.S. central bank officials have stressed so strongly that investors should not focus on when interest rates start to rise, but on the trajectory of the time it takes for normalization.
There are many variables in the game.
But in the end, market players may find that all the unrest associated with the rise in interest rates has been exaggerated.
“The first interest rate hike decided by the Fed after the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some voices as a sign of the ‘cheap money’ era,” said Julian Jessop, chief economist at Capital Economics, in a note addressed to customers.
On the contrary, we do not expect the gradual return of U.S. interest rates to more normal but still low levels to be the seismic shock everyone seems to fear.
However, it cannot be said that there will be no effect.
Below we present how several sectors of the economy could react, based on historical trends:
Given the situation the market has faced in recent months, anticipating the rise of interest rates can volatile things for a while.
However, at the time of growth, the impact is not so dramatic.
"There seems to be a tendency for capital yields to stagnate for 12-24 months after the first increase, which may again reflect the fault in monetary policy," Deutsche Bank analysts said in a recent study of what will happen after the Fed's gains.
Specifically, over the past 35 years, the market has grown abruptly – by approximately 14 percent – moving towards the interest rate rise, quite invariant in the 250-day period after (average rise of 2.6 percent) and then returning to normal after 500 days, with an average return in the last six cycles of 14.4 percent, according to a recent analysis published on Barron by Nuveen Asset Management’s chief strategist.
Deutsche said the impact on stocks tends to become more pronounced later in the interest rate rise cycle and the benefits begin to decline.
Recession is a reality of economic life but rising interest rates often contribute to it.
In this situation, the Fed is facing conditions that did not exist before and that could accelerate a recession.
More specifically, the gross domestic product will approach its historic low for an increase in the Fed interest rate.
According to Deutsche Bank, of the 118 interest rate increases since 1950, only twice the nominal GDP was below 4.5%.
Although in the second quarter of 2015 the figure was 3.6%, few expect the situation to persist, the third quarter reaching only 1.5%, according to the Atlanta Fed.
Rising interest rates in such a fragile economy could be risky and could raise the question “if this time is different,” Deutsche said.
Market players have been preparing for a growth decision from the Fed all year round, with all eyes on this week’s meeting of the Federal Open Market Commission, which ends on Thursday.
Although many strategists and economists are of the opinion that the FOMC could approve an increase in interest rates at this meeting, futures trades indicate a probability of only 25%.
“In our study since 1950, all interest rate growth cycles so far have been in a super profit growth cycle, with GDP overshadowing pre-recession peaks very quickly after the start of recovery,” the report said.
On the contrary, this was a strangely slow recovery after the worst recession in the period considered.
The current cycle is by far the longest expected by the Fed since the end of the last recession; the record was 35 months, and it reached 74 months and continues.
Fixed income has also been volatile given that the market anticipates an increase in interest rates and the pattern is somewhat similar to that of dividends.
The main difference is that the impact is faster for bonds than for stocks when the Fed changes policy.
In the case of bonds, it seems that the benefits change direction as soon as the first rise/fall in the cycle occurs.
At the end of the interest rate rise cycle, the yield of bonds immediately drops,” Deutsche said.
Strategists Charles Schwab are of the opinion that these interest rate increases will lead to the approximation of short-term and long-term bond yields, flattening the curve.
High yield bonds do better in such an environment, although “we’re still cautious about forcing yields,” said Kathy Jones, a fixed-income analyst at Schwab.
Interestingly, Jones is of the opinion that the markets have already adapted to the expectations of the Fed’s policy.
“In addition to the strength of the dollar and the decline in estimated inflation, there are some signs that the market has adapted to the prospect of a stricter monetary policy,” Jones wrote.
Short-term interest rates have risen, the yield curve is more straight, the average loan rate spread has expanded and volatility has increased – all characteristics of the market when the Fed is tightening the policy.
In general, companies that operate mostly in the U.S. will benefit from rising interest rates and local products will become more attractive.
High-debted multinationals will suffer because the rise of the dollar will drive their products up in the global market space and their debt will be more expensive.
“History shows that ‘quality’ stocks tend to be more profitable in the three months following an initial interest rate rise,” Goldman Sachs said in a customer report.
Firms with strong balance sheets surpassed those with a weak balance sheet after each of the interest rate increases in 1994, 1999 and 2004 by an average of 5 percentage points.
Companies with high capital gains and low volatility stocks also outperformed similar companies of lower quality by an average of 4 (percentage points) and 3 (percentage points).
Debt will become an important issue.
Companies with a high percentage of floating debt have the most to lose, Goldman says.
Consumers will also benefit from the rise of the dollar.
Those who save might also have to profit, although experts do not agree on how quickly this will happen.
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of Classic FM, says MP Andrew Bingham
Conservative parliamentarian Andrew Bingham criticized the radio station for "blowing"
He claims to be more and more similar to his commercial opponent.
He also took the eye of the BBC Music Awards, claiming they plagiarized the Brits Awards.
Colleague Damien Collins attacked The Voice, claiming that this show is not original either
BBC Radio 3 is “turning” into Classic FM, a senior MP said, pressuring the post to prove it does something commercial stations don’t do.
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham also told BBC chiefs that the public radio station is "dumbing" and increasingly resembling its commercial opponent.
“I have the impression that Radio 3 ‘dumbs’ – although I don’t like to use the word – but I have the impression that it’s turning into Classic FM,” he said.
He also took a look at the BBC Music Awards, launched last December.
The BBC Music Awards, launched last year, appear to be the Brits under a different name.
So if you try to do something different – these are the two examples that come to mind that only copy what’s already on the market,” said Mr. Bingham.
The BBC CEO denied the allegations, saying BBC Radio 3 is far ahead of its commercial opponent in terms of live music and public education.
I’m not going to learn anything about classical music from Radio 3.
And his commitment to live music and production has no rival.
“In addition, I think it’s also important that Radio 3 is committed to discovering new music and allocating new tracks,” he said.
In the early part of this year, BBC Radio 3 editor Alan Davey said he needed to make more efforts to attract the audience from the previous period because the British have fewer knowledge of classical music.
However, Radio 3 was not the only element under the BBC logo criticized at the meeting of the Culture, Media and Sports Committee for following in the footsteps of its commercial rivals.
Conservative MP Damien Collins attacked The Voice, the talent show BBC bought from Dutch producer Talpa Media for about £22 million.
Do you understand why there are often discussions about that show because it is not original and is not distinguished by anything?
Lord Hall insisted that the BBC1 show – with Paloma Faith and Boy George in the jury – be performed “in a BBC-specific way.”
He added that he wants the corporation “to find the chicken with the golden eggs in its own yard” the next time it launches an entertainment show.
However, he has refused to ban the future filming of new seasons of The Voice or to spend the money that goes on licenses on other entertainment formats.
Internet sales recorded lowest growth in August and could be blamed for Black Friday
In the first three months of 2015, online sales increased by 7%.
Last month saw the slowest growth since 2000.
Online sales boosted three years ago, thanks to the use of mobile phones to shop.
Experts believe that the Black Friday in November could cause reluctance to spend.
For over a decade, online shopping has exploded and turned UK shopping streets into ghost cities.
However, experts say there are signs that online sales are declining, with the latest figures indicating a growth of only 7% in the first three months of 2015.
The total money spent in August showed the lowest growth since 2000 to date, with a growth of only 5% in the past year.
Experts say there are signs that online sales are declining, with the latest figures indicating a growth of only 7% in the first three months of 2015.
“If we look at the level of growth from previous years and go back to 2000, there has always been a trend of rationalization over time,” said Andy Mulcahy, editor of the IMRG sales index, to the Guardian.
He explained that online sales boosted three years ago, when buyers started using mobile phones to shop.
This increased the number of people who could shop online and could do so in various circumstances, such as on the couch.
But now that it stagnates a little, you may notice a decrease (increase).
The Black Friday phenomenon, imported from America, is mentioned as one of the reasons for the decline in sales.
According to the experts, buyers would refrain from making purchases before the event that takes place on the last Friday of November.
Last year, five times the average number of shoppers stuck in front of computers to take advantage of deals, leading to the collapse of multiple retail websites.
Experts are of the opinion that Black Friday, when shoppers fought for bargains, could cause shoppers to reluct.
A study published by the British Retail Consortium determined that at least £1 out of every £5 is spent online.
For certain products, such as TVs and washing machines, more than a third of purchases are currently made through online stores.
At the same time, more than a quarter of people prefer to buy clothes and shoes online than to turn to fashion stores in commercial areas.
After sanctioning the bin Laden family, Muslims buried the victims of the crash in Mecca
The bodies of 29 of those who lost their lives were walked through the streets by Muslims, with the first funerals taking place in Mecca.
Saudi Arabia has partially blamed the construction giant Saudi Binladin Group for the collapse.
The Ministry of Health said a total of 394 people were injured in the crash.
During the street walk ceremony, hundreds of Muslims gathered to bury the 29 victims killed by a crane crash at the great mosque in Mecca.
Dressed in white, those who mourned their dead joined on the way to express their condolences, until the first dead reached the end of the final journey to the Al-Moaissem cemetery.
The sad memory preserved by the holy place, where just a few days ago a construction crane crashed through the ceiling of the mosque, falling on the believers.
The bodies were released for the funeral after the king of Saudi Arabia sanctioned the bin Laden construction group for the disaster, which also wounded 394 people.
In the street ceremony, hundreds of Muslims gathered to bury the 29 victims killed by a crane crash at the Great Mosque in Mecca.
Among the victims was the father of four children, Qasim Akram, from Bolton, Great Manchester, on his first pilgrimage when the crane crashed.
Mr. Akram was in the Great Mosque with his parents before the beginning of the annual Hajj pilgrimage.
Saudi authorities have already promised that the Hajj pilgrimage to Mecca will continue, with thousands of pilgrims still arriving in the city.
Today, King Salman stated that the Binladin Group should not have left the crane arm raised when the crane wasn’t working.
An Arab version of the decree, published by the Saudi news agency, said the Binladin Group was partially responsible for the collapse.
The agency's English-language service did not disclose the details, but said the company's leaders had been banned from leaving the country.
Earlier this week, Salman vowed to reveal what caused the crane to collapse in the Grand Mosque courtyard, where hundreds of thousands of Muslims came before the Hajj pilgrimage taking place later this month.
The Binladin Group has not yet made any statements about the crash and the Group representatives could not be contacted for statements.
The royal decree blamed the group for failing to use up-to-date security measures and failing to coordinate its work with the weather authorities.
Dozens of cranes surround the Great Mosque in Mecca as part of the massive construction effort led by the Binladin Group.
For several decades, the Binladin family has had a close relationship with the Saudi royal family and carried out major construction projects.
The last leader of al-Qaeda, Osama bin Laden, was a “renegated” son who had been demolished by his family in the 1990s.
The collapse occurred under strong wind and rain conditions just days before the arrival of millions of people to the kingdom to participate in the pilgrimage, a crucial journey at least once in the life of every physically fit Muslim.
Authorities say 158 people remain in the hospital.
Authorities have decided that the relatives of the deceased victims will receive one million Saudi rials (£174,000) and the same amount will be paid to those with permanent injuries.
The other injured will receive half of that amount.
Advantages and Disadvantages of Credit Conversion in Swiss Francs
On the banking market have already appeared two offers to convert loans in Swiss francs, the main advantages being the exclusion of foreign exchange risk and the reduction of rates.
Disadvantages can come over a few years, when variable interest rates can lead to higher rates.
Bank Transylvania has just completed the process of converting Volksbank loans into francs, and Bancpost has announced a conversion offer for its own clients.
According to data collected by analysts of the financial portal FinZoom, Bancpost offers three years of fixed interest rate at RON, of 1.5%, the lowest on the market.
On the other hand, Bank Transilvania’s conversion offer was accepted by 83% of clients with francs credit due to two successive discounts: the balance was reduced with the value of the risk and administration fees paid by the client, then an additional reduction of 22.5% was applied to the RON balance.
Both offers reduce the rates of their own customers, compared to how much they paid monthly equivalent in RON before the conversion.
Thus, the Bank of Transylvania reduced the rate by 42.5%, and Bancpost, by 33% in the first three years and, in theory, by 18% in the following years.
Benefits
The main advantage of the CHF credit coverage is that it eliminates foreign exchange risk, the consumer is protected from future increases in the franc, and the repayment of the credit will be made in the currency in which he receives his salary.
Another major advantage of both conversion offers is that there is no re-evaluation of the property, no additional guarantees and another proof of income are required.
Basically, there will be no new financial and legal analysis of the loan and there will be no additional costs as in the case of a refinancing.
Both banks also offer a discount on the monthly rate, compared to what customers paid before the conversion, equivalent in RON.
Risked
The problem is that the rate in the first years is made up more of interest, and the customer pays back very little of the principal.
Bancpost’s very low interest rate offer in the first three years appears to be advantageous for customers.
It is unclear how this will evolve in three years.
The margin offered to customers can be greater than 3.25%, so overall, and the cost reduction is lower.
A possible risk for all loans in variable interest rates is that the ROBOR index will increase significantly in the coming years (more than the Libor index - CHF).
For example, ROBOR at three months is now 1.44%, but in 2013 it had reached the value of 6%, in 2009, to over 15%, and in a few days in 2008 it exceeded 40%!
In addition, other costs may arise, not mentioned in the initial offer.
The time has come for the Federal Reserve’s interest rate decision.
The world is looking forward to a two-day meeting scheduled for Wednesday and Thursday, when the U.S. Federal Reserve will make the crucial decision whether to raise interest rates for the first time in about a decade.
In a Reuters poll of 80 economists, just over half of whom last week believed that the decision would be made, I now believe that the situation will continue for a while and that interest rates will be kept in the current range of 0-0.25%.
It’s a historic event because it’s been seven years since the Federal Reserve brought interest rates to zero.
For the first time, we are facing a situation where a major central bank could drop the zero rate and initiate a process of normalizing interest rates,” said Angel Ubide, chief analyst at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The U.S. economy has developed relatively well, with the recovery bringing trillions of dollars into the balance sheet and generating low inflation.
But the Federal Reserve should not ignore the less pink global situation.
He warned markets to prepare for growth but there are signs that even they think such a move is unlikely.
The decision will be announced on Tuesday, 20:00 CET.
People who have lost their charm
The actor (left), along with his son Redmond (right), has gone through stressful situations in recent years.
In 2001 she fought with leukemia and in 2009 she lost her lifelong partner, Farrah Fawcett, to cancer.
It is also rumored that the actor was faced with the drug problem and in 2008 he was arrested for possession of drugs.
All of this has a cost.
Manchester United player Luke Shaw has been on the bar for several months due to double fractures.
Luke Shaw suffered a double fracture in his right leg in Manchester United's Champions League match, which ended with a defeat against PSV Eindhoven.
After the event that brought tears to the player’s eyes and will keep him on the bar for at least six months, Louis van Gaal remains optimistic that Shaw will be able to play again this season.
The injury occurred following a reckless intervention by Héctor Moreno in the 15th minute after 20-year-old Shaw broke the PSV defense.
He received medical care for nine minutes on the ground and needed oxygen before being taken to the hospital.
Van Gaal said: “He has a double leg fracture and is in the hospital.”
He will be transferred tomorrow or maybe after tomorrow and then he will be operated in Manchester.
It’s terrible – a boy who came to Manchester United when he was 18, he’s facing difficulties, then he’s playing fantastic and now that’s happening.
He had an oxygen mask in his dressing room.
It was crying.
I am not a doctor, but with a double fracture the rest is six months and I will not play in the group phase.
I hope he can play again this season.
It turns out that Moreno was lucky and escaped the red card and the concession of a penalty shot.
The referee Nicola Rizzoli did not punish the Mexican.
Van Gaal suggested the Italian official was wrong.
You can judge for yourself when I say it’s fault and red card.
It was a very bad operation with two legs.
A tweet on Shaw’s Twitter account: “Thank you all for your messages, I don’t have words to express how weak I feel, I start the way to recovery, I’ll come back stronger.”
Manchester United hit by Luke Shaw's injury in PSV defeat
The founder of the England team has an additional reason to recover to play at the European Championship in France next June.
Phillip Cocu, PSV coach, said: “It’s a very ugly injury.”
Everyone is very sad when a player suffers such an injury.
Our players never aim to hurt an opponent.
Moreno broke his leg as he played for the national team of Mexico against the national team of the Netherlands led by Van Gaal at the 2014 World Cup.
"It's very hard for him because he didn't intend to hurt his opponent, and when you hear it's a very serious injury, it's not good," Cocu said.
I did not see the stage.
I could only see the ball, which was heading in a different direction, so it seemed [Moreno] had touched it but I could not see the intervention on Luke.
In a statement to SBS6, Moreno said: “I know how it is, I know how difficult it is to go through something like that.
I feel so bad, I feel so bad.
PSV player Andrés Guardado also arrived in the hospital after an intervention from Chris Smalling.
Adam Lyth clearly risked the omission of England but still holds strong
Victory against Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task but, after seeing the team selected by England for the tournament, I don’t consider a repeat of the 3-0 defeat in the test matches.
I would not eliminate the possibility of a victory in the move.
Alastair Cook’s team may have less experience than three years ago but they have good players on the spin in the batting line and the collective morale is strong; they will not be marked by the events of 2012 but will have a positive youthful attitude.
Moeen Ali evolves as a spinner and Adil Rashid, although unknown at the test level, is an option for attack.
Adam Lyth left England for test matches and was replaced by Alex Hales
Obviously, as his top coach in Yorkshire, it’s hard for me to consider the decision not to select Adam Lyth into the team.
He played the seven test matches against two good attackers in tough conditions, and the simple but harsh reality is that cricket players are judged by the results.
There were no question marks about Joe Root, for example, until the announcements were made because – and I said that earlier – players are their own selectors.
Fifty years later, Lyth might have extended his run, but his fate lies in his hands.
I hope that if he runs more for Yorkshire he will have other opportunities.
England’s top coach, Trevor Bayliss, praised his attitude even when the performance was not on the level of his capabilities and I’m not surprised; above all, he’s a team man.
It is difficult to answer the question of how long a batsman is noticed in test matches.
Lyth had seven runs—like Sam Robson before him—while Nick Compton had nine.
Only Compton was lucky at home and on the go.
The only disappointment you could have was that England favoured Jonathan Trott on the Caribbean tour - when Lyth was in full shape - but that missed opportunity is the realm of the past.
In the team comes Alex Hales, a batsman I rate very well.
He’s a cricket player who has the “X Factor” and we noticed early in Yorkshire this season when he scored 236 against us on a Trent Bridge pitch.
He should be given at least the same opportunity as those before him, but this will of course depend on the UAE team’s composition.
It was launched the idea that Moeen would open to beating alongside Cook, which would bring extra spinner while keeping four quicks, and I have nothing against.
I don’t see why a thrower couldn’t hit there and this left-wing player has already proved that he’s damn damn.
Maybe Moeen didn’t bring success to his district, Worcestershire, but it was No. 3 for them, so the difference is not big.
My old teammate, Justin Langer, played his first 38 test 38 matches as a first drop before entering the open in 2001.
He immediately erased three centuries and did not look back.
Zafar Ansari comes on the team as a back-up spinner and although I had limited contact with him, it struck me that he is a very impressive young man.
People could judge his early age – with an average of 31 on the beat and 35 on the ball – and they might think he’s a punt, but there’s not a bunch of spinners and the selectors have opted for youth.
You will learn a lot from this tour.
The team also made some changes to the coach.
The appointment of Mahela Jayawardene, a Sri Lankan batsman, as a consultant for test matches could be a master hit.
He is one of the best players and will bring a lot of experience, given that he has played in every situation and against all types of attacks.
Paul Collingwood comes for the tournament’s white-ball leg and will bring both energy and relentless ambition.
I always thought he was born to engage in international cricket, whether as a player or as a coach, and like Mahela, he has intuition.
Sometimes, new voices in the dressing room, even if they transmit messages that have already been transmitted, can bring fresh air to the team.
Colly Durham’s teammate Ben Stokes is taking a rest for the one-day matches, Root got a similar break against Australia and I have no problem with that.
Although not everyone agrees, coaches and selectors don’t make the schedule.
And you have to keep in mind, players’ jobs depend on the results they get.
Such decisions are never taken easily.
The Brexit camp could win if the economy remains calm until 2017
Day by day, David Cameron’s renegotiation strategy to keep Britain in the EU gets more and more confused, even without the choice of the brilliant “Yes or No?” Jeremy Corbyn to lead the Labour Party or TUC brings serious criticism to Europe on Tuesday.
They also have characters like Corbyn and Nigel Farages.
A European diplomat explained last days that – plunged into crises similar to that of the EU – not all being provoked internally – some member states are fuelled by Britain’s agenda of concessions and treaty changes, which most do not want.
At the annual meeting in Brighton, the TUC decided that they would not want to do so if it would erode social protection.
We could even call it Dave and George’s selfie agenda.
The Prime Minister and the Chancellor attend bilateral summits or sessions in foreign capitals, take a picture of each other in front of a famous local monument, with or without the local representative, then return home and declare that they have gained allies for reform.
It is just about me.
My European friend, who wants a Britain with outlook under the EU’s roof – “Don’t leave us alone with France,” says Berlin – suggests that several ministers and officials from certain capitals have come to a point where they don’t care whether they stay or leave.
Angela Merkel, the extremely cautious German chancellor, is an ally but she has been in charge for 10 years and wants to leave the position before her situation ticks, as has happened to Thatcher (11), Mitterrand (14) and Kohl (16), who have stood too long.
In 2017, French President François Hollande will be re-elected or replaced.
His power is in decline.
Poland could soon have a right-wing nationalist government, Spain one on the left.
It’s hard to believe that they’ll help the posing English, whose energy would be better used to prevent Scotland from leaving the UK – something they don’t want either because most have similar separatist tendencies.
Thus, some ministers may even plan to deliberately make comments that do not help, in the SNP style, in the campaign for the 2017 UK referendum to speed up the Brexit process, my friend suggests.
“The renegotiation was fixed” and “Britain gained nothing of value from the renegotiation.”
Europeans know on their own how captivating Fleet Street can be, and how skeptical are the barons in the oligarchic press who look at the EU with skepticism, because they did not participate in the 1975 referendum inspired by Tony Benn who ratified our 1973 entry in a 2:1 ratio.
They may vaguely remember Boris Johnson, the euro-opportunist, who became famous in the early 1990s when he was the correspondent of Brussels.
Ed Miliband knew his enemies.
They included the mixture of non-tax pockets, foreigners cheating by phone, and pseudo non-domains who own most of the major newspapers.
In fact, Tony Blair saw them somewhat the same, but he realized that when you are locked in a cage with a nervous gorilla, you have to give her bananas to distract her from the thought of eating for lunch and tea again.
In fact, Miliband was more Blairite than Blair in opposition to Cameron’s idea of a referendum, considering that Blair made a principle concession to the abandoned EU constitution, buried by French and Dutch voters in 2005, who gave him an exit card.
The press did not forgive him.
But Jeremy Corbyn, who gently touched my back on Monday at Westminster — I told him to stop spending his time with me — seems to be in danger of adopting Murdoch’s strategy of boycotting Neil Kinnock in the 1980s, a mistake then and now.
It may take time, but he has to develop a coherent strategy of cooperation with the media, not with me, but with Andrew Marr whose position at the BBC left her vacant on Sunday.
Corbyn’s official stance on Europe is what I would indulgencely call evolution.
He stated that he would like us to stay in a reformed EU.
Most of those who disagree with the “Englishism” of the Conservatives may agree with this.
That’s what Hilary “A Benn, but not a Bennite” Benn said on radio and TV this week, when the investigator in him struggled not to acknowledge that Corbyn’s appointment of John McDonnell as “shadow” finance minister was a bad idea.
He reminded me of the 1970s when his father fought on television to be disloyal to his Labour colleagues, without going too far and without losing his position in the cabinet.
Hilary’s fight was more attractive.
But the struggle to stay “in any situation” – Benn’s expression – doesn’t match what McDonnell said or what JC said to colleagues and lawmakers during Monday night’s private meeting.
Regardless of the image Corbyn wants to convey – remember, it has also raised my awareness – message discipline remains important in the era of television and especially in the twilight of social media, an outbreak of paranoia and betrayal.
It’s fair not to give Cameron a favour ticket in Europe, allowing him to take advantage of Labour’s support in the referendum campaign, McDonnell said.
Simon Jenkins definitely believes that.
But McDonnell and Corbyin’s basic sophistication of EU membership – consistent with their anti-capitalist past – is no longer just an esoteric discussion among leftist dissenters for whom narcissism of small differences is a central dogma.
As with his NATO sophistication – Tom Watson is unwavering about the fact that JC won’t campaign for resignation – foreign diplomats will be forced to try to understand.
Why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital — and there are suspicious voters — on concessions to Britain when everything might be useless?
The U.S. is already quite disappointed with British poor military performance in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even with a conservative government cutting costs, as I was reminded at the launch of the British Influence Security Forum on Monday.
Experts criticize England's Public Health Department's decision on e-cigarettes
According to the researchers, the claims of a government agency that e-cigarettes are 95% less harmful than smoking resulted from a meeting of 12 people, some of them with links to the tobacco industry.
Experts in the editorial team of the British Medical Journal (BMJ) joined the publication Lancet in criticizing the evidence used by the Department of Public Health of England (PHE) in its e-cigarette report.
The PHE published the “reference” report last month and described it as a “complex analysis of evidence.”
However, several researchers have questioned the robustness of the data and pointed to the links between certain experts and the tobacco industry.
An article published last month in the medical journal Lancet attacked the “extremely fragile base” on which PHE founded its main conclusion.
Two other researchers who write in the BMJ questioned their claims and foundations “on solid soil or on moving sand.”
Martin McKee, a professor of European public health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and Simon Capewell, a professor of clinical epidemiology at the University of Liverpool, said: “A fundamental principle of public health is that policies must be based on evidence of effectiveness.”
They said they expect the PHE claims that “current estimates show that e-cigarettes are 95% less harmful than smoking” to be based on a detailed analysis of evidence and models.
In fact, a single meeting of 12 people led to the development of a multi-criterion decision analysis model (MCDA) to synthesize their views on the adverse effects associated with different nicotine-containing products; the results of this meeting were briefly presented in a research paper.
McKee and Capewell said one of the sponsors of the meeting was a company called EuroSwiss Health, whose chief executive was said to have previously received funding from British American Tobacco for an independent study.
It also validated BAT accreditation in public health in a sustainability report, he said.
They added that one of the 12 participants in the meeting said they received funding from an e-cigarette manufacturer but not the funding theyly received from the cigarette and tobacco manufacturer, Philip Morris International.
The arguments on the basis of which the panel members were selected were not provided, but among them are some well-known “fronts” in the production of e-cigarettes, some of whom even declare in the paper financing of the industry.
Other meeting participants are not known for their expertise in tobacco control.
The meeting was also attended by the head of the tobacco control department of the PHE.
The group’s research work “convincingly simulates” the lack of “solid evidence of the harmful effects most products have according to most criteria,” McKee and Capewell said.
However, none of these links or limitations are mentioned in the PHE report.
McKee and Capewell said PHE’s claims that “so far there is no evidence that e-cigarettes are an incentive factor for smoking among children or non-smokers” are premature.
Professor Kevin Fenton, head of the health department at the PHE, says that the claims in the BMJ have been responded in the past.
He said: “E-cigarettes are significantly less harmful than smoking.”
One in two people who have smoked all their lives lose their lives because of this addiction.
All evidence suggests that the health risks posed by e-cigarettes are comparatively small, but we need to continue to study the long-term effects.
The PHE has a clear duty to inform the public about the information that comes out and the information that does not come out of evidence, in particular given the high degree of public confusion about the relative hazards compared to tobacco.
Every year, about 80,000 people die from a smoking-related disease and the annual costs of the national health system due to smoking reach 2 billion pounds.
By clearly expressing the current evidence – namely that while using e-cigarettes is not without risks, they represent only a fraction of the harmful effects of smoking – we are fulfilling our national duty.
Illegal torture equipment - delivered at the door!
Advertisements that embarrass Britain's arms trade
Watch the Amnesty International film against the arms trade.
A terrible killer drone.
To smash the ankle!
Dispersion of bombs.
And electric sticks that cause awful pain without leaving a trace!
The joyful voice and animated images leave no doubt that this ad for the world’s largest weapons trade fair is a fierce joke, made by Amnesty International to highlight the British authorities’ desire to sell weapons to repressive regimes through Defence and Security Equipment International at the ExCeL Centre in London’s Docklands.
DSEI arms fair: authoritarian regimes arrive in London
But a separate campaign has also resulted in a large number of posters displayed at bus and subway stations that need a second look.
“An important announcement, are you traveling with DLR between September 15 and 18?” says one of the ads, using the fonts and branding of the London metro, the DLR line turning into the image of a tank.
In September of this year, a lot of arms dealers will rush into the DLR and customers are asked to help stop the arms trade.
The 300 posters are made by artists who exhibited the works at the Cruel Designs Museum in Dismaland, Banksy.
A group called the Special Patrol Group contributed to the distribution in London using “Ad Space Hack Packs,” a 6-pound package of Allen keys that he claims “facilitates access to about a third of the advertising space at the bus stops on the planet.”
London’s transport management is not amused by this “vandalism” in the form of wheels.
One of the parody ads produced by Special Patrol Group.
According to Gavin Grindon, Cruel Designs curator and lecturer at the University of Essex, artists are increasingly asking questions and seeking to make political works accessible to the public outside of the galleries.
Many artists turn to collaborate with activists in protest movements, realizing that they have to go out into the real world in order for their art to have an impact on society.
Another poster against the arms trade that welcomes passengers on the subway.
The Amnesty made the film had over 100,000 views on Facebook in 24 hours and was created by the advertising agency VCCP that worked pro bono, and the graphic designer and the artist who doubled the voice also worked for free.
VCCP’s creative director, Matt Lever, was shocked by the silence surrounding the weapons trade show – with an empty space in the ExCel calendar – and thought, “Let’s give them the campaign they’re trying to avoid.”
They played with making a more realistic advertisement but “enriching it with animations and powerful colors, it was more striking.”
“They did a great job helping us increase interest in selling illegal torture equipment at the trade fair,” said Tom Davies on behalf of Amnesty.
Now, it would be necessary for UK authorities to take action and ensure that torture equipment is not illicitly sold and delivered to the door.
Per the most creative art form on the weapons trade fair theme comes from inside ExCeL, where exhibitors offer fantastic euphemistic products.
In a press release, Saab disclosed an order received from the U.S. military on “AT4CS RS with shoulder-backed launcher.”
This includes “a unique-shaped focus that provides stunning effects behind the armor inside the target.
Whatever that means, it won’t be pleasant.
8 Golden Rules for Living at Home
It’s been 11 years since I moved home, when I was a 19-year-old who still believed in berets and moral relativity, but I only now remember the forced smiles of those I annoyed – and the many complaints to others.
Most of the things we have learned can be summarized in the form of eight simple rules.
Moving into the home can bring states that range from nervous downturn to horror.
The spell is tempting: tell people where you come from, if and where you spent a year off from school, what you think of Corbyn and why, “Honestly, you don’t care Marmite because, good guys, it’s nothing but HAHAHA yeast extract, you find me in my room.”
Take a deep breath.
And also help others to breathe – ask questions and show interest.
They animate the conversation and help you differentiate the people you like from those you’t even talk to if the flood came and they’d be the only ones to have boats.
Do not suffocate people.
The bedrooms often abound with drinks parties, movie evenings and socializing meetings, but they are also the place where people dress up and try their underwear.
Related Topics: Don’t even think about starting your student life in a relationship
Introverts receive special treatment at the university.
Your bedroom should be a refuge, but in many homes a culture of living through the bedroom is built, based on friendship, socialization and friendships that last a lifetime.
All this can be awful for someone trying to charge their batteries.
Nothing in this culture allows you to say, “I like you and I want us to stay friends, but I want you to leave to recover the energy I spent interacting with you.”
Try to notice when a colleague is tired of socializing – and try sending a SMS instead of knocking on the door.
That comes about knocking on the door: do it.
A guy who sat in the same home with me had a policy that said that if a door was not locked, then he was invited to enter.
He saw a lot of things.
Make friends cooking.
Since you start college in the Bake-Off fever, if you knock at someone’s door to get acquainted and also bring a plate of blackheads, it sounds less strange, less like the situation of the 1950s, “Welcome to the neighborhood, I have cooked something for you, now smile and I ask personal questions.”
Home-cooked goodies are a great way to make friends.
Your speakers will feel compelled to talk and may end up associating your figure with a tasty surprise.
You must be a skilled cook.
Cucumbers of flour, sugar, and fat will most likely cause others to pretend to sleep when you knock on the door.
Food theft is a common crime in student homes.
Obviously, if you wipe someone’s chicken it’s theft, but if you take a drop of milk to put in your tea it’s still theft?
Ask the owner.
He’ll probably tell you to serve yourself even if it’s boiling inside.
If someone steals your stuff, it’s annoying and I understand you – you still try to approach the problem more mature than my fellow homeowner, who colored his milk with liquid detergent to punish those who stole.
He is now in prison.
Don’t make noise that doesn’t let others sleep or study.
It’s not just because it’s common sense, but because you’re walking on your own.
A girl on the floor with me asked her neighbor to give music slower because it was 3 a.m. and she had an exam in the morning.
Their reaction was to make the music louder.
When they finally stopped the music at 5 a.m., the girl was kind and let them sleep for two hours before giving up to the music, locked the door and went to the three-hour exam.
Wouldn’t it be romantic if the future husband/wife moved on the same floor?
On the contrary, would it not be extremely strange if you confused a fellow pallier with your future spouse, coupled up, split up, and should meet daily and maybe even see him capture all the common friends?
Of course, you can’t resist your heart – but if a sexy coworker is definitely not your future husband, try at least to be rational.
At the exciting moment you realize that someone left their keys in the unlocked room, the line between farce and intimidation is finer than it seems.
A successful farce is funny, but it can distort in a few moments.
Teach a fun and valuable safety lesson by hiding something – but never dirty someone’s room with toothpaste and shampoo.
Close the door and put the keys in a glass of water you put into the freezer – but don’t stick someone’s goods to the ceiling more than twice.
Violinist David Grimal: In the Bach era there were no world tours.
Beethoven, Brahms, Bartok, Enescu were working people, artists and not commercial representatives.
French violinist David Grimal is one of the great artists of our time, known not only as a soloist but also as the initiator of a less ordinary, quite “strange” project, as he says himself, Les Dissonances – an orchestra made up of international soloists and talented musicians, who perform a symphonic repertoire without having a conductor, and that makes it at least a curiosity in the classical musical landscape.
Les Dissonances was this year at the Enescu Festival with two performances: a performance on Sunday, in which the solist was David Grimal, the founder of the orchestra, and one month, when in the forefront was the violinist Xavier Phillips, the works composed by Enescu being untouched.
Both shows, held on the stage at the Athenaeum, showed the audience a different way of performing classical music.
Les Dissonances appeared on the music scene in 2004 being, at the time, the only classical ensemble in which there was no conductor.
The conductor is the most important musician for musicians.
It is true, on the one hand, musicians need an education either to become soloists or to become performers in an orchestra – they are talking about instrumentalists, not composers.
They are trained as “specialized workers.”
They feel they need a leader.
On the other side of the stage, for the audience, all musical fetishization focuses on the conductor.
And so the business, the music industry, does its marketing.
We are no longer talking about music.
So if we look at this world, we have on the one hand skilled workers, which is stupid, and a public that can’t listen, but must watch, which is stupid,” Grimal said.
The violinist says that this change in the way he makes music came as a result of “musical disappointments” in his career as a soloist.
I was like a high-level athlete who had to do the same exercise around the world with different orchestras, to earn a lot of money and to bring money to the music industry.
Ten years ago, when I was about 30 years old, I found this very depressing, because I could no longer find human creativity and brotherhood in this system.
There is no point in continuing on this path.
So I decided to create the dissonance.
This happened in 2004, and at the time no one did this without a conductor: "The music world, extremely conservative, did not want such projects."
“How can I imagine marketing with a collective of musicians where there is no more ego?” asked the artist.
David Grimal acknowledges that Les Dissonaces represents "a luxury", stating that none of the musicians who are part of the orchestra depend on the success of this project to live.
In the 10 years of the ensemble’s existence, the lack of a conductor has not proved to be an obstacle in the musical act: “Curiously, the more complex a repertoire we sing, the simpler it seems, because all musicians are obliged to be present in the opera and not just in the role,” Grimal says, adding that at the Sunday show “we were 74 conductors on stage.”
In Grimal’s opinion, the Enescu Festival is a “very courageous one”, precisely because it also invited Les Dissonances: “An extraordinary festival, where the largest orchestras in the world are present and sing three times a day, and in the midst of these orchestras you invited this strange group as well.”
In a temple of orchestral tradition, such as the Enescu Festival, there is a place and interest in something different, which breaks down barriers.
Speaking of Enescu’s work, the violinist acknowledges that he feels the Romanian music of the famous Romanian composer, so he did not need a special approach when he introduced Enescu’s works into his repertoire.
Grimal notes that Enescu’s music is very instinctive, but this happens when we talk about George Enescu and Romanian music, “because there is also a George Enescu who made French music.”
Grimal advocates for changing the way classical music education is done, believing that “the profession of musician, as it is organized today, is deadly” and that “the future of music is music itself.”
We don’t need to go around the world five times a year if it’s useless.
At the time of Bach, there were no world tournaments.
Beethoven, Brahms, Bartok, Enescu were working people who were artists and not commercial representatives.
For me, organizing concerts, festivals, tours, releasing albums are all formidable, extraordinary, but as long as they are done in the service of music.
If not, we are in a system where creativity suffers, no longer has freedom.
To illustrate this phenomenon, David Grimal gave the example of Romanian products before and after joining the European Union: "In Romania, before you entered the EU, you had good vegetables and meat."
To enter the EU you had to adopt sanitary laws that are not good for vegetables and meat.
Production and agriculture come to the service of supermarkets, as was the case in France.
The same thing happens with music, the same logic.
Les Dissonances makes reds maybe not too beautiful, but when we cut them, they are real reds.
In an ideal world, this music should return to the center and that the institutions and industries that manage this system understand that music does not need to be sold, but needs to be shared, and this can be done starting with education policy.
“If we considered – as the Koreans, Chinese, Japanese do – that Western music is one of the most beautiful things of humanity, we would reintroduce its learning in school, we would reintroduce television concerts and through this education we would no longer need to sell musical by-products,” Grimal says.
Certainly, there are things in classical music education that remain very communist, that everywhere is something very militarized.
It depends on this discipline whether we compare a musician to a soldier, or whether we form a musician who will sing to an instrument, being, above all, a musician.
We are talking about a completely different education, if we want to train a soldier (this education) must be in a way, if we want to train a musician, it is completely different.
In your opinion, what is more dangerous, a soldier or a musician?” asked the French artist, smiling.
Grimal points out that, for artists, the reward of a different way of making music comes precisely from overcoming this "soldier" status, overcoming what "they think is their limits": "Musicists discover at some point that they are not soldiers, and therefore after the concert they come out smiling."
David Grimal spoke about his musical project and his vision of music and the artist in the "Festival of Ideas", a discussion with the audience organized at the George Enescu International Festival by the Aspen Institute Romania.

Cinema City is looking for "Little Big Voices"
Cinema City launches the hottest challenge for children: doubling two characters from the superproduction "Snow Queen 3D"
Do you have a super talented and spontaneous child who loves movies?
Give her a chance to become a star.
In September, as part of the latest campaign dedicated to enthusiastic and ambitious children, eager to become future stars and between 8 and 16 years old, Cinema City seeks "The Little Big Voices", giving them the extraordinary opportunity to duplicate two characters from a famous animated film.
If in the classic cartoons the emphasis was placed on bringing the voice of the actor closer to the character’s specificity, in recent times, when creating the story, those who will interpret the voices are also considered, and they are usually very well-known actors.
Cinema City Romania, however, wants to discover new voices and that is why we are launching an unprecedented campaign.
We want to find the right voice and challenge parents to enroll their children in our contest.
They will have a special experience, because the characters are sympathetic and the replicas are funny.
“Children will have fun and a real chance to be part of a team of actors,” said Ioana Ionescu, Marketing Manager at Cinema City Romania.
In the first phase of the competition, from 11 September to 30 September, Cinema City will organize a preselection in which 10 children (five girls and five boys) will be selected who will have the opportunity to test in a recording studio with professionals.
All parents have to do is access the platform micilevocimari.cinema-city.ro, where to enroll the child in the contest and prepare him for the voice test.
Then, they must choose one of the four films available on the platform, download the texts that the child is going to read and then, the child will register playing his own version of the duplicate.
Four films about friendship, fairy tale heroes, magic and hope can choose competitors for the trial: "Yellow Feather 3D", "Moon: The Guardian of the Moon 3D", "Blinky Bill: The Untold Koala 3D" and "Maya Albino 3D".
Finally, the two most talented children (a girl and a boy) will see their dream come true and will double each character in the superproduction "The Snow Queen - Snow Queen 3D", which will premiere in Romania in November this year.
FedEx Gains Mixed, Reduce Tax Forecasts for 2016
FedEx disappointing results for the last quarter, with the shipping giant reducing its year-round profit forecasts due to low demand for shipping services and increased costs for its land shipping division.
The company also said it plans to hire around 55,000 seasonal workers for the holiday period.
In the same period last year, FedEx announced it would hire 50,000 seasonal workers for the holiday season.
The company’s shares fell by about 2.5 percent in pre-market trading, 45 minutes before the opening bell sounded on Wednesday.
FedEx Corp. said it expects to earn between $10.40 and $10.90 for the fiscal year ending in May next year, 20 cents less, according to an earlier estimate.
Analysts expected the figure to be $10.84, according to a survey conducted by FactSet.
The declining estimate comes despite an average price rise of 4.9% with entry into force on 4 January and higher surcharges for land transport of large or heavy packages, which will apply from November.
The company said it still expects earnings to rise over the previous year as a result of reduced costs, higher revenues and the development of online commerce.
President and CEO Fred Smith said that “the company is facing a significantly weaker economic situation than expected, in terms of global production and trade.”
The holiday hiring plans were announced a day after competitor UPS said it plans to hire 90,000-95,000 additional workers, roughly the same number of hirings it made last year.
In the quarter ending August 31, FedEx earned $692 million, 6% more than the previous year.
The earnings per share were $2.42, below the average estimate of $2.44 per share by 12 analysts who responded to the survey conducted by Zacks Investment Research.
Profit increased by 5% to $12.3 billion.
Six analysts surveyed by Zacks estimated the sum to be $12.23 billion.
FedEx has been hit in recent years by a decline in international priority shipping, which has led to stagnation in its Express unit’s revenue.
But the explosion in online shopping has jumped the results of FedEx Ground.
In the last quarter, the ground division’s revenue grew by 29%, but operating revenue has stagnated virtually due to higher costs for large packages and own insurance.
The express unit saw an increase in revenue due to higher base rates, while revenue for the freight division decreased due to rising costs.
At pre-market trading, about an hour before the opening sound, FedEx shares had dropped by $3.85 or 2.5% to $150.15.
On Tuesday at closing, it had dropped 11 percent at year-over-year level and 17 percent from its highest record on 11 June.
At the most anticipated meeting in recent years, Federal Reserve policymakers will spend two days this week around a 27-foot Honduran mahon table to decide whether it’s time to raise a key interest rate for the first time in a decade.
Above them, at one end of the central bank’s meeting room, a wall painting of the United States will be seen.
The map is meant to remind that Janet L. Yellen, President of the Fed, and her colleagues must put the economic interests of the nation above anything.
The Central Bank has been given a double task from Congress: to maximize U.S. employment rate and maintain price stability.
But since the Great Economic Crisis, the Fed leaders have confirmed that there is a third unwritten task: financial stability.
And this third task could be the X factor in a decision too hard to forecast, which will be announced on Tuesday, to determine whether the U.S. economy is ready to get rid of the unprecedented boost offered by the near-zero short-term interest rate in force since the end of 2008.
Even though most data indicate a strong-growing economy, recent turmoil in global financial markets could scare Fed officials already cautious about adding volatility by raising the federal fund reference rate — even by just a quarter-point.
“Of course, labour market and inflation will be the first and main aspects that will follow,” said Lindsey M. Piegza, chief economist at brokerage firm Stifel Nicolaus & Co.
“But I think if they were looking for an excuse not to raise interest rates, the growing uncertainty in the global market would be enough to give them reason to wait,” she said.
There is no consensus on the decision the Fed will make, which itself creates instability in the financial markets.
About half of the economists recently polled by Bloomberg anticipated a rise in interest rates this week.
But financial markets are expecting the Fed to delay, a key indicator showing that the likelihood of growth is only 30 percent.
This would indicate a fall on the stock market if the Fed raises the interest rate, unless policy makers would mitigate the blow by promising that it would take a long time until the next increase.
On Tuesday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 228.89 points, or 1.4%, to 16.599.85.
The boost was triggered by expectations that Fed decision makers will keep interest rates stable this week, said John Lonski, chief economist at Moody's Capital Markets Research Group.
“It would be surprising if the Fed raised interest rates at this time,” Lonski said.
If the Fed’s decision makers did, “they should act in depth in their policies to avoid panic in the financial markets.”
Other experts said a rise in interest rates would soothe financial markets as it would remove the uncertainty about when the Fed will act.
Just a month ago, the Fed seemed to be about to raise the rate by 0.25% this month, the first small step towards slowly tightening monetary conditions that would confirm the strength of the U.S. recovery.
Yellen said in the spring and early summer that she expected interest rates to rise this year despite liberal objections that more economic progress would be needed.
Although job creation slowed in August, growth in the labour market has been solid this year.
The unemployment rate dropped to 5.1% last month, the lowest rate in more than seven years and close to the level considered by the Fed as total employment.
Wage gains showed signs of growth.
And while inflation continued to be below the central bank’s annual target, Fed decision makers said a key reason was the temporary effect of the sudden drop in oil prices.
The economy “can cope with higher rates and needs them given the tension in the labor market,” said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.
But global financial markets began to fibrillate at the end of this month after China devalued its currency.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 16 percent below its record high in May as investors feared a slowdown in the Chinese economy would drag down global growth.
The market fell slightly this month, with the Dow index now approximately 10% below its May peak.
For Fed decision makers, market agitation adds to the complex calculation of the moment to raise the interest rate.
“Without what has happened to the financial markets and the news of China’s weakening economy in recent weeks, it would be stronger at the meeting,” said Stephen D. Oliner, an experienced researcher at UCLA’s Ziman Center for Real Estate and former Fed official.
Now, he expects they will wait at least a month to better manage the effects.
“There is a lot of uncertainty about what the impact will be on the U.S. economy, and they have almost no data on which to rely after events in China,” Oliner said.
The well-being of the global economy is not one of the Fed’s major interests, so it should virtually not be taken into account in decision-making.
But in reality, the Fed has become the global monetary authority.
In recent years, the influence of the central bank has been huge.
The mere hint by then-president Ben S. Bernanke in 2013 that the Fed could “strengthen” its monetary expansion has triggered an earthquake in global markets.
In a world where markets and economies are increasingly clogged, it is expected that Fed officials will not only monitor progress in other areas, but also consult with other central banks and experts to better interpret the global economy.
His decision-making is “more art than science,” said Zachary Karabell, head of global strategy at Envestnet.
Jeffrey Lacker, chairman of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, Va., said this month that “The Fed has a history of overdimensional reaction to changes in the financial market that appear to be unrelated to economic bases.”
Lacker, a voting member of the Federal Open Market Commission, a decision-making body that advocated an increase in interest rates, gave the 1998-99 decisions as an example.
A financial crisis that hit Asia has prompted the Fed to lower the benchmark rate by 0.75% in three meetings, “despite the limited identification implications for U.S. development,” Lacker said.
A year later, the Fed officials reverted to those cuts.
The Fed should only put the issue of financial stability first in the event of a major crisis, such as the 2008 market earthquake, said Adam S. Posen, a former member of the Bank of England’s interest rate committee.
The last turbulent period is not far from that level, he said.
“We don’t want to get into the situation of fearing a rise in interest rates because the markets are upset,” said Posen, president of the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The Federal Reserve Act still holds the double mandate and does not mention financial stability and, until anything changes in that regard, I don’t think it should take early action.
Looking for an unusual market with Thai specifics?
Try the LAX-C in Chinatown.
Chinatown
The market/deposit opened/opened in 1997 is owned by LAX-C Inc.
Often called Thai Costco, LAX-C is a Thai wholesale market that also sells to the public.
Yes, it’s in Chinatown, not in Thai Town.
Market/Storage is a universal store offering a stunning range of fresh, frozen and dehydrated products, popular Thai and Asian snacks and kitchen utensils, furniture, religious and holiday decorations.
There is also a car district where you need to buy some motor oil.
The store is huge and it takes at least an hour to walk through all the corridors.
If you feel hungry from so much purchased, eat at LAX-C BBQ Express.
The interior food district of the store (good, affordable as price) is close to the houses and offers several options of dishes that can be taken in package.
What does it have in stock: Do you need something - anything- Thai?
You will probably find it at LAX-C.
The products have reasonable prices and some items are sold wholesale.
Fresh products include herbs, fruits and other Asian and Thai products.
The meat district is large, as is the fish district – the staff serving will clean and filet the fish and even roast it to you if you want.
An important part of the store is dedicated to the huge freezer district, where you will find frozen curry leaves, melon and ginger, whole ducks, fish, beef blood and bile, pig carcasses, fish cuffs, traditional, semi-prepared sausages and more.
Who buys from there: Restaurant owners and chief chefs, as well as families and individuals.
On the wide corridors can fit both shopping carts and fork carts.
Discovery: Fresh Durian fruits right next to the house area.
Where: The store is located in an industrial area of Los Angeles, on the outskirts of Chinatown and Downtown - a few streets from Philippe The Original.
Parking: LAX-C has its own shared parking area with other shops and restaurants.
Although there are chances that the store will crowd up, it is usually not difficult to find a parking place.
Seven's Sunrise dominates polls despite Channel Nine's attempts to broadcast on the Today Show about the change in party leadership
The urgent move of Karl Stefanovic and Lisa Wilkinson to Canberra to convey on the subject of the consequences of the changes from the liberal party leadership did not bring a significant increase in audience for Today.
The morning broadcast of Channel Nine aired from the capital after the defeat of Tony Abbott against Malcolm Turnbull.
The competing Sunrise, hosted by David Koch and Samantha Armytage, was captured in London as part of a series of broadcasts running over a few weeks, which also included Dubai, New York, Niagara Falls and Cancun.
This “cruel” of distance did not seem to matter much to Aussie TV viewers, with Sunrise having an audience of 397,000 viewers in the five capital cities, compared to Today with 339,000.
Today recorded a slight increase compared to Monday’s (317,000) and last Tuesday’s (283,000) audiences but the figures were lower than last Thursday’s (343,000).
Today has decreased the difference to Sunrise in recent months.
In August, Today had an average audience of 318,000 and Sunrise 330,000.
At the beginning of the year, the difference ranges between 40,000 and 50,000.
So far, in September, Sunrise has an average audience of 349,000 and Today 314,000.
This is the most interesting thing that happened this morning.
This morning, not only Parliament is affected by the current of change!
Karl and Lisa are fine, thank you for your question!

The main news was the stunning debut of the 800 Words series featuring the former star of Packed to the Rafters, Erik Thomson.
The new drama, about a recently widowed father who decides to move with his two children to the coast of New Zealand, had an impressive average audience of 1,219 million viewers.
Critics wondered if Thomson was able to cope with a show on his own without Rafters star Rebecca Gibney.
The audience results for last night answered sharply that “yes”.
The X Factor show, broadcast by Seven, remained on track with 1,136 million viewers, slightly overtaking the shows The Block (838,000) and TBL Families (726,000).
Seven recorded ups and downs on the second night it aired The Chase Australia.
The first half-hour (17:00 to 17:30) of the new general culture show moderated by Andrew O'Keefe had an average of 446,000 viewers.
The second half-hour (17:30 to 18:00) climbed to 623,000 viewers — enough for a small victory over Eddie McGuire’s show, Hot Seat (613,000).
On Monday evening, the first half-hour of The Chase Australia show had an average audience of 520,000 viewers and the second half recorded a huge figure of 720,000.
Hot Seat had an average audience of 620,000.
The drop in Chase Australia’s recorded audience on the second night will give the Nine a tacit confidence that Hot Seat will eventually triumph at 17:30.
The Chase Australia replaces Million Dollar Minute, a show that failed to beat McGuire’s show.

Elton John and Russian President Vladimir Putin to discuss homosexual rights
In 2003, Mikhail Khodorkovsky, the richest man in Russia, was arrested under gun threat at a Siberian airport.
Because he openly challenged President Vladimir Putin, Hodorkovsky was convicted, his oil company, Yukos, confiscated, and his pro-democratic efforts were diminished.
Four people killed after police fired rubber bullets at protesters in Nepal
Four people, including a 4-year-old boy, were killed in southern Nepal after police fired rubber bullets at a crowd protesting against the country's proposed new constitution, a official said on Wednesday.
Violence broke out on Tuesday night in the Rupandehi district, about 280 km west of the capital Kathmandu.
According to Bishnu Prasad Dhakal, the head of the district police, more than 1,000 protesters gathered in front of a police station, and some of them threw stones and molotov cocktails.
Mr Dhakal said police used tear gas and then fired fire into the air before resorting to rubber bullets.
He said twenty police officers and five civilians were injured.
It was not immediately clear why rubber bullets, which are known to kill but are commonly used as a less lethal alternative, caused so many deaths.
The clash was the last after weeks of violent protests in southern Nepal, where members of the Madhesi ethnic group say the new provinces established under the new constitution would dilute their political influence.
Protests have also been held in western Nepal, where the Tharus ethnic group wants its own state.
At least 40 people, including 11 police officers, were killed in the violent clashes that broke out on August 10.
When four major political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces - a major step towards a new constitution but a highly controversial issue in Nepal, a country ruled centrally for hundreds of years.
The process for drafting a new constitution began in 2008, but lawmakers accelerated the process after the devastating earthquake that killed thousands of people in April.
This week in Kathmandu, lawmakers voted on the clauses in the draft constitution and officials said the new charter could be adopted on Sunday.
We will not use wire fencing, dogs, police officers and weapons
The Prime Minister continues the exchange of replies with the Hungarian authorities.
At the opening of the government meeting on Wednesday, Ponta reiterated Romania’s firm stance on the refugee crisis.
We make every effort to manage the refugee crisis, all institutions have a coordinated opinion.
Romania does not agree and will not apply anti-democratic measures, guard dogs, wire fencing or police with guns.
"It's a shame for the 21st century Europe to apply the methods of the 30s." said Victor Ponta
"The prime minister also said that all dates and details of the refugee crisis will be discussed and settled at the CSAT meeting on Thursday."
NHC announces 60% probability of cyclone south of Cape Verde Islands
A large low-pressure front approximately 560 kilometers south of the southernmost point of the Cape Verde Islands has a 60% probability of turning into a tropical cyclone within the next 48 hours, the U.S. National Hurricane Center said on Tuesday.
Another well-defined low-pressure front about halfway between the Cape Verde Islands and the Lesser Antilles also shows a 60% probability of a tropical cyclone forming in the next two days, the Miami meteorologist added.
Weight reduction surgery could be useful for diabetics with mild obesity
The benefits of weight reduction surgery in people with mild obesity with type 2 diabetes could beined for at least five years, according to a new study.
It is still premature to say whether diabetics with mild obesity live longer after weight loss surgery than those who follow non-surgical treatments.
“It takes a long time to centralize mortality data,” said Dr. Robin Blackstone, a specialist in obesity surgery, as she wrote an article on the new study in JAMA Surgery.
Weight loss operations, also called bariatric surgery, use various methods to shrink the stomach.
They reduce the feeling of hunger and limit the body’s ability to absorb food.
Over the years, bariatric surgery has proven to be effective in the treatment of type 2 diabetes, but most studies have been conducted on people with morbid obesity with a body mass index (BMI) of 35 or higher.
BMI, a unit of measurement of weight relative to height, is considered normal in the range 18,5-24,9.
A BMI of at least 25 indicates that a person is overweight and people with a BMI above 30 are considered obese.
You can calculate your BMI by visiting: 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
For the new study, researchers at Taiwan’s Min-Sheng General Hospital used data gathered after 2007 in a trial that compared two types of bariatric surgery – gastric bypass and mansion gastrectomy – in the medical treatment of type 2 diabetes in people with mild obesity.
The average BMI in people who underwent surgery dropped from 31 to 24.5 by the end of the fifth year of the study.
Meanwhile, the BMI in people who received non-surgical treatments against diabetes remained almost at the same level, namely 29.
Of those who underwent surgery, diabetes was completely cured in 36% and partially in 28%.
In the group treated by medical methods, by comparison, diabetes was completely cured in only 1% and partially in only 2% of subjects.
In addition, blood pressure control, triglycerides and “bad” LDL cholesterol “were generally better in the surgical group,” the authors concluded.
The researchers also monitored blood levels of hemoglobin A1c, which reflects blood glucose levels over time.
The researchers write that the optimal level of hemoglobin A1c is below 7%.
After surgery, the average level of hemoglobin A1c dropped from about 9% to about 6%.
But in the group treated by medical methods, it remained at around 8%.
But this improved “glycemic control” – reflected by improved hemoglobin A1c levels – did not reduce the mortality rate to five years, according to lead researcher Dr. Chih-Cheng Hsu and colleagues.
The research team also compared the average results associated with the two types of surgery.
In the fifth year, compared to the group with handcuff gastrectomy, the group with bypass surgery lost more weight (18.7 versus 14.2 kg), experienced more significant decreases in BMI (7.4 versus 5.1) and hemoglobin A1c (3.1% versus 2.1%) and had a higher likelihood of complete remission of diabetes (46.9% versus 16.7%).
Although the new study does not indicate any benefit in survival or surgery after five years, there is evidence from a study conducted on overweight individuals in Sweden that surgery prolongs life, says Blackstone, of the University of Arizona, School of Medicine - Phoenix.
In the Swedish study, obese people who underwent bariatric surgery had an approximately 29% lower likelihood of dying after 15 years compared to a group that tried more conventional methods.
Although the new study did not indicate a survival benefit in patients who underwent surgery, Blackstone said it is an optimistic outlook for people with BMI under 35 interested in the procedure.
“This is the point where this paper is critical because it states that this surgery is safe in the group with lower BMI,” without increasing the risk of death or kidney disease, she says.
Blackstone added that patients and their doctors should start taking weight seriously when the patient’s BMI reaches 27-30.
“I think we’re waiting too long to urge people to take this issue seriously,” she said.
I think once they have accumulated these genetic changes that have shortened their bodies predisposing them to obesity and diabetes, it is extremely difficult to get back to normal.
“It’s impossible for everyone to come to Europe” – Dalai Lama
Europe could not receive all the refugees, the Dalai Lama said, adding that the real solution to the current situation of the refugee crisis lies in the Middle East.
The Tibetan Buddhist leader has issued a call to end violence in the refugees’ home countries.
The Dalai Lama spoke about the current issue of the refugee crisis in his speech at the opening of the Dalai Lama Center for Compassion in Oxford, dedicated to ethics studies, at the beginning of his 10-day visit to the UK.
He stated that in the current situation, the interests of humanity should prevail over the interests of each nation and even of each continent.
He also stressed that, although admirably, the response of Western European countries to the refugee crisis is inadequate to the situation.
“It’s impossible for everyone to come to Europe,” he said in his speech.
Although the Dalai Lama praised the efforts of Germany and Austria to cope with the crisis, he stressed that it is only a temporary solution.
“It’s wonderful to care for a few thousand refugees, but at the same time we need to think about long-term solutions to bring sincere peace and development, especially through education, to Muslim countries,” he said.
In the end, we need to think about ways to reduce crime in their countries.
We need to reduce the use of force.
The Force has never solved these problems,” he added.
On the issue of violence, the Dalai Lama also commented on George Bush's actions after the September 11 terrorist attacks, saying that the violent response from the United States has generated a chain of uncontrollable events.
After the 9/11 events, I expressed my condolences in a letter to President Bush and told him to solve this problem without resorting to violence.
I know his motives were strong, but he used force and generated unexpected consequences," the Dalai Lama said.
The number of children who have ingested hand detergent in the last four years has quadrupled.
According to the Georgia Anti-Poisoning Center, U.S. anti-poisoning centers have an increase of about 400% since 2010 in the number of children under the age of 12 who swallowed high-alcohol hand detergent.
According to Dr. Gaylord Lopez, director of the Georgia Anti-Poisoning Center, cases of hand detergent ingestion in children under 12 years of age at anti-poisoning centers rose from 3,266 in 2010 to 16,117 in 2014.
“Children have more access to these products and unfortunately a percentage of them go to the emergency room,” Lopez told CNN.
Lopez said some children deliberately drink detergent while others do so to impress their friends or respond to challenges on social media.
You can watch videos on YouTube that show teenagers how to drink detergent to create cheap drinks.
It turns out that teenagers mixed the detergent with mouthwater with alcohol to get a stronger drink.
Younger children may be attracted to the attractive smell of the detergent.
“A child doesn’t think it’s hurting them,” says Lopez.
Many of the most attractive types (hand detergent) are fragrances.
Hand detergents with the aroma of strawberries, grapes, orange are the most attractive for children.
Hand detergent contains approximately 45-95% alcohol.
Especially in young children, just a few swallows can cause alcohol poisoning.
“It’s very concentrated alcohol,” Dr. Stephen Thornton, medical director of the anti-poisoning center at Kansas University Hospital, told Fox Channel 4 in Kansas City.
Thus, we avoid leaving a glass of whiskey on the table, but people leave these hand detergents in accessible places and if the little ones get to them, this is a quick way to consume a lot of alcohol.
Nhaijah Russell, a six-year-old girl who recently ingested the equivalent of four stoves of strawberry-aromated hand detergent at school, arrived at the emergency room to receive treatment.
She had alcoholemia179, twice the threshold at which an adult is considered by law under the influence of alcohol, according to Dr. Chris Ritchey, an emergency room doctor who treated her at Gwinnett Medical Center outside Atlanta.
Nhaijah was stunned and could not walk when he arrived at the emergency room.
Doctors monitored her overnight in a separate children's hospital to identify signs of brain injury as she fell and hit herself in the head because of alcohol, Ritchey said.
“It was terrifying,” Ortoria Scott, Nhaijah’s mother, told CNN.
It could have been fatal.
Lopez advised parents and teachers to use alcohol-free wet products or towels and to stop leaving the hand detergent out of children’s reach.
In addition to alcohol poisoning, some detergents have been associated with deaths.
In 2013, two women in Ontario died after swallowing a hand detergent containing a toxic, undeclared ingredient.
Health authorities assumed that the product contained methanol, a lethal substance, and not ethyl alcohol, specified as the active ingredient.
In January, three fourth grade students in northern New York plotted to poison their “bad” teacher “by putting antibacterial products in the classroom,” according to a police report.
The teacher is very allergic to hand detergent and has banned it in her classroom.
The police considered the plan “insignificant” and referred the disciplinary matter to the school inspectorate.

De Boer, currently Ajax ambassador, said: “In the Netherlands I no longer transmit the Celtic match summary; why?”
Because the Rangers are not there.
It’s not just the return of the Rangers.
We are talking about the old company.
We are talking about the two teams together and that is where the interest is headed.
The tension is high in the Old Firm matches and not only Scots want to see these matches.
I will change the situation, promises Deila.
RONNY Deila has accepted that Celtic is fighting hard, but the Norwegian chief has promised to change the situation.
The defeat against Malmo and subsequent elimination from the Champions League were followed by the defeat against Aberdeen who played in 10 men, now at the top of the ranking with a five-point advance.
But Deila said: “Celtic have had periods before and will come back.”
We want to get out of this situation as soon as possible.
I know it’s very frustrating and many people are extremely angry or sad about what’s happening.
We feel the same, but we need to move forward.
We need the support of the Celtic because so the players get better.
It is very important to remain united now.
Warburton's caution about January transfers
Despite comments just a few weeks ago suggesting that he has identified a few goals for the January transfers, Rangers boss Mark Warburton is cautious when it comes to transfers, insisting he does not want to affect the Ibrox unit.
The former Brentford chief said: “The transfer period in January is very different from that of summer.”
In the case of players transferred in the summer, there is a pre-season period in which they can be integrated, which you may have noticed this season in our group.
The team does very well.
Sometimes you do more harm if you bring in unnecessary players.
Celtic targeted Michu after retirement
Swansea striker Michu, associated with Celtic during the transfer period, suggested he could withdraw at the end of his contract with Swans.
The 29-year-old has struggled with his ankle problems for two years and failed to leave Wales in the summer.
Hearts faces SFA over Neilson's comments
Hearts led 2-1 when Paterson was eliminated and lost 3-2, but the defender’s red card was then cancelled – the third red card cancelled in eight months.
Neilsonins his statements, insisting: “I have not questioned integrity, I have not commented on performance.”
Griffiths vow to avoid Tynecastle
The Invincible Hibee was caught up after admitting that he sang an offensive song about former Hearts player Rudi Skacel.
The incident occurred in March 2014 in a pub in the Roseburn region of Edinburgh before a derby with Edinburgh at Tynecastle.
“It was a derby and it was the excitement of the moment,” the striker said, adding, “There’s no need to say I won’t go back to Tynecastle unless I play for Celtic.”
Tannadice Board Confides in Management of Dundee United - Donnelly
Simon Donnelly insists that the board members of Dundee United are still confident that the management team will change the situation - but he agrees that the decline on the ground must end.
I think Stephen Thompson trusts us.
We’ll get the boys back in shape,” Donnelly said.
McInnes is happy for 'dirty victory' against Hamilton
Derek McInnes acknowledges that the Aberdeen team must desperately cling to Hamilton Accies to get their seventh consecutive league victory, which brought them five points ahead of Celtic due to the first half penalty kick run by Adam Rooney.
McInnes said, “There is no team that has won anything, in the cup or league, and that hasn’t won matches like that.”
Unemployment rate in Scotland remains unchanged while in the UK rises
The unemployment rate in Scotland remains unchanged, at 164,000 in May-July, while the number of UK unemployed overall increased by 10,000 to 1.82 million in the same period.
The unemployment rate of 5.9% in Scotland was higher than in the UK of 5.5%, according to figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS).
Meanwhile, the employment rate in Scotland decreased by 12,000 over a three-month period, with the number currently employed at 2,612,000.
The employment rate in Scotland fell in that quarter to 74.0% - a figure above the UK average of 73.5.
Scottish Secretary of State David Mundell, commenting on the latest figures, said: “The authorities’ long-term plan has laid the foundation for a stronger economy.”
It has been almost a fixed year since Scotland made the historic decision to remain part of the United Kingdom.
Over the past 12 months, we have seen improvements in the Scottish labour market, with employment rates rising and unemployment rates falling.
Why I'm Witnessing an Execution in Oklahoma
In the course of today, except for a late legal intervention, I will look at how a man is condemned to death.
If it happens, and I hope it doesn’t happen, I’ll sit in an observer room in the Oklahoma State Prison Execution Hall and see Richard Glossip being executed by giving the lethal injection.
He asked me to be one of the four official witnesses to his death.
The invitation first came in January through his best friend, and although I was shocked, I accepted.
As the day of the cause approaches, the idea scares me.
So why should I do it?
I agreed because I thought it was a good way to tell the whole story of the death penalty.
It would provide a unique perspective.
It’s true, journalists can witness executions in America, and because requests usually exceed the number of seats available, a macabre lottery takes place to decide who will be chosen.
Oklahoma has reduced the number of seats reserved for press representatives from 12 to five.
The elected will look at the execution with impartiality.
I cannot do that.
I would sit next to Richard Glossip’s closest friends, in addition I developed my own connection with him over the months of telephone conversations and a visit that lasted two and a half hours.
I like the guy.
We laugh a lot when we talk.
The prison authorities say that I cannot be both a witness and a journalist, so I will not be allowed to have a carcass and a pen with me to write down what I see.
I will have to try to remember all the details.
A journalist in Oklahoma accused me on Twitter of compromising my impartiality.
Here is the lesson.
Tell the prisoner’s story as he wants, get access.
I complained to her.
He admitted that “they could have formulated it better,” but still believes that I am wrong.
Richard Glossip disagreed with some of the things I said and wrote.
He doesn’t tell me what to write, and I’t do it even if he asked me.
I told him he could remove me from the witness list at any time.
But he wants an international report to be present on the subject.
He believes that if he dies, advertising will help the movement against the death penalty.
Kim Bellware, a reporter at the Huffington Post, will be with me.
If you want to learn more about the case, listen to the multimedia file series we have made.
I will not go back to all the details.
I cannot say with certainty that Richard Glossip is innocent.
His actions after the murder of Barry Van Treese make him guilty of complicity.
However, he is not likely to be guilty of the murder.
I believe with certainty that there was not enough evidence to justify the death penalty.
I think his execution is wrong.
And I will look at him dying from that perspective.
I can’t say I’m completely objective.
For this, you can read the articles written by other reporters.
From me you will learn what it’s like to watch a man who likes to die unnecessarily.
Peter Moody claims stewards have tried to spy on him and threatens to withdraw
Peter Moody claimed that the Victoria Racing stewards had attempted to infiltrate a spy into his stalls last year and threatened to immediately withdraw from the races.
He launched an attack against the stewards and the integrity department of Racing Victoria, claiming that they were running a personal campaign against him, the drop that filled the glass being the removal of Lady Tatai from the race due to a treatment administered on the day of the race.
Moody told Fairfax Media that he has always tried to do his best for the racing field and that he is put in a difficult situation when it comes to the positive result on Lidari’s cobalt test, for which he has no explanation.
For 18 months she swallowed her words about spy statements and didn’t want to look like “the fox that doesn’t get to the grapes.”
“I wasn’t going to say anything about that and I’ve been silent for a long time, but sometimes you get to a level of frustration so high that everything suddenly blows up,” Moody said.
It is known that it continued.
Sometimes you react and you have to endure the consequences, and I will have to live with what I said.
Tonight I will go home and sleep quietly.
I want to go with my head up and I want the owners I work with to see that I strive to give them the best.
From the moment they start to think that this is not the case, I have to give up my job as a coach.
At that point I will have to think about what I will do with my certification.
Earlier, Moody threw the bomb in an interview with racing.com in which he said the integrity department had tried to spy on his stalls.
“Eighteen months ago, Terry Bailey, Dayle Brown and Dr. Brian Stewart were sitting in a room next to a man – whose name I’ll tell if I’m asked – and offered to hire him to my stalls to provide information about the activity there,” Moody told Racing.com.
He sees me as a scammer.
If so, then everyone should resign because they were incompetent in trying to catch me.
Robert Roulston, former Chairman of RVL, David Moodie, current Chairman of RVL, and Bernard Saundry, current CEO of RVL, knew at the time and do know today.
Should I think it’s something personal?
Is it necessary for the RVL to start to have a backbone and can it hold people outside the trainers accountable for what is happening in the industry?
Do I have a bad influence on the industry?
Is my influence on the industry so bad?
Maybe others see that.
Per they need to take my license and put me aside, and I have no doubt that the statements I’m making now might make them think about this option.
But I have come to a point where I don’t care anymore, and that makes me sad.
It saddles me very much.
I will put pressure on them and make them make a decision.
My family supports me and I can leave.
The coach’s frustration grew with the lengthy cobalt testing investigation involving Lidari and the removal led him to say he could “put his license on the table.”
Moody, whose name is most often associated with the training of the unbeaten champion Black Caviar, labeled the rule of treatment on the day of the race as "ridiculous" after a mud or clay cataplasm was applied to the horses' feet, which violates the rules.
Violating the Rules of Race.
I have to take full responsibility for this,” he said.
One of my employees accidentally put mud on his foot.
It could have happened last night.
It could have happened yesterday, which has happened.
It happened on the day of the race.
Moody could be disqualified for three months for the race day treatment consisting of the application of cataplasma, for which the stewards opened an investigation.
It is a joke.
People who make these rules know nothing about horses.
“We all understand that rules are needed, but we have gone too far,” Moody said.
The driver who struck and fled from the crash site in Cobram has been arrested
Police arrested a man after a collision with a cyclist occurred in Cobram at the end of the week and followed by escape from the scene.
The cyclist was transported by helicopter to the Royal Melbourne Hospital, being seriously injured after being hit by a car on the Murray Valley highway on Saturday morning.
Police say the driver did not stop to help the injured cyclist.
On Monday, a 50-year-old man surrendered to police in Shepparton.
He will be charged with escaping from the scene of the accident, failing to provide first aid and other traffic offences.
The cyclist, a 40-year-old man from Cobram, remains interned in a stable condition.
Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy responds to opponents in wrestling charges.
Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy called criticism of his team’s placement tactics “distorted topics” raised by the NRL’s top two favorites.
Sydney Roosters coach Trent Robinson said the referees allowed Storm’s players to “take their shots” in Storm’s nervously won match in the qualifying final played Friday night in Sydney.
Brisbane Broncos coach Wayne Bennett made a slight reference to Storm after his team's victory in the qualifying match against the North Queensland Cowboys, played Saturday evening, when he called the match a "demonstration" of the rugby league and said the two Queensland teams were not very good at wrestling.
Bellamy jumped in defense of the placing tactic approached by his team and said the players were simply focusing on “contact” when they placed.
Bellamy says he gained confidence after two leading coaches criticized his team, which means they were worried that Storm would beat them.
“And things don’t stop here – we haven’t heard Trent Robinson complain about wrestling when they beat us 24-2,” Bellamy said on Wednesday.
I can guarantee that we have not changed anything in our defensive systems or techniques all year round, only that in the last six weeks we have really put the emphasis on contact in plaques and thus changed the situation.
Trent has been in this position for three years and obviously has a great team so he probably isn’t used to losing and it was a shock for him.
As always happens at this time of year.
Bellamy contradicted Bennett's idea of "animating football" by reminding his mentor St. George-Illawarra Bennett's Dragons won the championship in 2010 by playing "dull" football.
Wayne talks about exciting football.
He argued his opinion by comparing his Saturday evening game to our Friday evening game and talked about how exciting the game was,” said Bellamy.
I remember that in 2010, St. George received a lot of criticism for being a boring team and Wayne said he didn’t care how black under the nail.
But now he has a team that can play what we think is exciting football, especially thanks to the fast young midfielder.
This is the kind of game you want to do when you have such players.
He brought this argument in 2010, now he wants everyone to adopt his style of play – not every team has two midfielder like Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt to be able to play that way.
It gives me more confidence because they say these things because they are somewhat concerned about the match with us.
Six weeks ago they probably didn’t think of us when they thought of the important matches.
Bellamy also highlighted that the match between Storm and Roosters was a harsher score-related race compared to the match between the Broncos and the Cowboys.
The Broncos match was probably a good match, I haven’t seen it yet, how much was the score? 16-12?
Our match ended 20-18, in our game there were two more attempts, that means exciting game?
Or exciting means taking pauses and not marking?
There are plans for me.
If they talk about us, it means that at some point we could meet them.
Storm is free this weekend because they have won the right to play at home with either the North Queensland Cowboys or the Cronulla Sharks in the final of the preliminary next Saturday at AAMI Park, with tickets on sale starting next Tuesday morning.
Stevan Hogg used girls’ phones to lure pedophiles to send pictures
A pedophile used the phone of an 11-year-old girl to ask for pictures of abused children.
Stevan Hogg took the girl’s phone while she was asleep and then logged in to an online messaging service where another user sent her a series of nasty images with copies as the subject.
She later woke up and noticed the phone disappeared, which she found in Hogg’s hand while he was asleep.
She looked into the phone and found the disturbing messages after which she immediately alerted her mother.
Upon arrival, police saw the five photos and then analyzed computers found at that address and found “worrying” searches on the Internet using terms to find indecent images of children’s subjects.
Hogg claimed he did so to “attract pedophiles” to the Internet before “pretending to be a police officer to scare them.”
Prosecutor Eilidh Robertson told the Dundee court: “He said it’s addiction—that it’s addiction to scare people.
He admitted that he did the computer searches but said he did so because he wanted to show himself as a police officer to scare pedophiles.
He was asked about his conversations with the unknown person who sent him the pictures and that he asked the person to send him more pictures.
He said he did it to tempt.
She said she no longer thinks clearly when she drinks and that she wants to see images of rape and murder.
Mr. Robertson added: “When the girl found the messages on the phone, she cried out to her mother and trembled and cried.
The girl saw the ugly images on the phone and the accused was confronted.
The girl was interviewed and told that the accused used the computer and the Playstation to talk to girls who looked much younger than him.
Last year, on June 14, Hogg, 23, resident in Ward Road, Dundee, pleaded guilty to allegations that he had taken or taken indecent photos of children, and violated the conditions of conditional release on January 25, this year, and did not appear before the court at the appearance on March 24.
The defence lawyer, Gregor Sim, requested that Hogg not be registered in the sexual offender register because it can be said that this offence “did not involve a significant sexual aspect.”
Judge Alistair Carmichael postponed the sentence until October due to social reports.
Hogg was released on bail in this case but remained in custody before appearances for other cases.
He was entered into the sexual offender register before his sentence was given.
Robert Mugabe, the president of Zimbabwe, delivered the wrong speech in Parliament
Earlier this year, Mr. Mugabe, Africa’s oldest leader, fell on a podium.
He was not injured, but the filming of the fall became viral on social media.
The opening of the parliamentary session was also disturbed by opposition representatives who claimed to have received anonymous death threats, threatening them not to hide Mugabe during his speech.
Last month he was whispered during his speech in Parliament — a speech he repeated on Tuesday.
Innocent Gonese, the leader of the parliamentary group Movement for Democratic Change (MDC), said seven opposition politicians received text messages on their mobile phones, being warned not to disturb Mugabe's speech.
“The message was sent by a hidden number but it’s titled ‘death,’ he told reporters after Mr. Mugabe’s speech.
It warns parliamentarians concerned that immunity only applies in Parliament and once they leave Parliament, parliamentary immunity is no longer valid.
The leader of the parliamentary group said the party, led by Morgan Tsvangirai, is “preoccupied” with the threats sent to politicians.
Hewlett-Packard to Reduce 30,000 Jobs
Hewlett-Packard is expected to make between 25,000 and 30,000 redundancies as part of the company’s efforts to restructure and cut costs in the service sector.
HP will split into two companies this year, separating its computer and printer division from its fast-growing enterprise hardware and service operations.
The expected disbursements will cost approximately $2.7 billion starting in the fourth quarter, HP said.
“These restructuring will bring the new Hewlett Packard Enterprise a more competitive and cost-sustainable structure,” said Meg Whitman, President and CEO of HP, who will lead the unit after the breakup.
“Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and more concentrated than HP currently has and will have a broad business portfolio that will help companies transition to a new way of doing business,” Whitman said.
Operating as a separate company, we are better positioned than ever to meet the growing demands of our customers worldwide.
According to a company statement, Hewlett Packard Enterprise will have annual revenue of over $50 billion and will “focus on providing unrivalled integrated solutions” for companies.
It split up a company founded in 1930 by Stanford graduates Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard, whose electrical equipment production business and whose garage in Palo Alto was called "Silicon Valley slope".
HP has undergone a massive reorganization to adapt to the transition from traditional computers to mobile devices.
HP, the world’s second-largest computer manufacturer and one of the largest technology companies in the U.S., is the latest in the field, based on the idea that companies that focus better in one direction perform better.
FriendsFest: the comedy series that taught us important lessons about men’s friendship
The absence of similar characters in the series is obvious, given that the need for men to open up is now more desperate than ever, with suicide rates among young men reaching a peak in 15 years.
In 2013, suicide was the leading cause of death among men aged 20 to 45 in the UK, and remains three times more common among men than among women.
In an attempt to address the problem, the Campaign Against Living Miserably (CALM) designated 2015 as the Year of Men, seeking to challenge the culture that prevents men from asking for help when they need it.
Friendship is at the heart of the struggle to succeed in this challenge.
A recent study of more than 2,000 high school students who had symptoms of depression concluded that if a patient is surrounded by enough “healthy mood” friends, his chances of recovery double.
In the same way, for people who are not depressed, a circle of mentally healthy friends halves the likelihood of developing mental disorders.
Of course, in order for friendship to have an effect, it must first be accessible.
In this era of communication dominated by social networks, where emphasis is placed on style rather than substance, the immediate nature of the response often takes precedence over contact with meaning.
Our digital lives have doubled the need to create the appearance of a strong personality, open to fun and success, even though in reality isolation is the one that dominates.
This superficial success is dominated by what psychologists call extrinsic values; money, image, social status, all at the expense of intrinsic values – our inner desire for personal development and friendship – that affect our mental health even more deeply.
The billionaire inventor of a video game has recently explained that money doesn’t really buy happiness.
The beauty of the Friends series was that it turned attention to this idea.
The characters were not defined by the workplace but by their own personality, which they showed through interaction as friends.
The humor of Joey and Chandler’s frequent hugs, the moments they watch football in their comfortable chairs, and Ross’s passion for Rachel came from the fact that it is known that men can associate with this situation, even though they often refrain from fully exploring their feelings.
As one social worker explained to me: “My role in listening to people with suicidal and depressed tendencies has shown how even the slightest interaction with friends can make a difference.”
Often, people who appeal to us do not feel able to talk to friends.
The old saying to deal with yourself is strong, as is the feeling of being perceived as a weak person if you talk openly about problems.
Friends is one of the series that comes to mind when I try to offer more mechanisms of long-term psychological adaptation.
The series highlighted the small moments of friendship between men.
No matter how much objective, external, telephone intervention helps people in moments of despair, long-term support comes from family and close friends.
So, if you are attending this weekend at the FriendsFest organized by Comedy Central, with the full playback of the shooting plates to celebrate the event, why not invite your friends to a coffee at Central Perk.
Or, even better, if you see someone alone in Starbucks, smile and say hello.
You never know what a difference your friendship could make.
Friends is broadcast by Comedy Central from beginning to end - all 236 episodes - on #FriendsFest
Di Maria scores and helps PSG give Malmo aside
Angel Di Maria celebrates alongside Blaise Matuidi and Edinson Cavani after scoring against Malmo.
Angel Di Maria scored on Tuesday in his debut match in the Champions League and helped PSG dominate against Swedish Malmo.
Here is the history of the game and the reaction to the game.
Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani did their duty, Paris Saint-Germain starting the Champions League group series with a reassuring 2-0 victory against Malmo in the match played on Tuesday at Parc des Princes.
Di Maria scored in less than four minutes from the start of his Champions League debut match with PSG, bringing the French champions to an advantage despite missing a number of opportunities before securing their advantage with the goal scored by Cavani in the 61st minute.
Arriving in Group A with Real Madrid and Shakhtar Donetsk, Paris needed a strong start against the Swedish champions because the French team’s goal is not only to qualify for the best, but also to improve the way to the quarterfinals in each of the last three tournaments.
But despite taking the points, Laurent Blanc’s students were far from a perfect picture, with Zlatan Ibrahimovic wasting the goal opportunity after which he was replaced by his hometown team and the club where he started his brilliant career in 1999.
"It's not easy to win at home or on the move in the Champions League, so winning 2-0 creates problems for our opponents and sets a comfortable difference against the next-placed, even though there are still aspects we need to improve over the course of the season," Blanc said.
It is a good sign.
We wanted to win and we did, but I’m sorry we couldn’t score one or two more goals.
Ibrahimovic returned after an injury in one of the three changes with the team in Paris, with a 2-2 draw won at home by Bordeaux in the Premier League this weekend, but Di Maria took the spotlight in the fourth minute.
Last month when he was transferred from Manchester United, the Argentine offensive midfielder was named the man who will take PSG to the next level in Europe and demonstrated this when he stumbled at Marco Verratti’s pass behind Malmo’s defense before whistling incredibly over Johan Wiland in the long right corner of the gate.
But if anyone expected PSG to win by kicking their fingers, they were disappointed.
Malmo, who defeated Celtic in the play-off to get to this stage and entered the field with nine national teams holders, with a five-man defense and two defensive midfielder, was a strong opponent.
But their attack was not impressive, with the exception of Nikola Djurdjic who passed Kevin Trapp’s post in the 34th minute.
Instead, the PSG players slowed down several times, giving a few unnecessary passes and not finishing the interventions, even Ibrahimovic who missed no less than five attempts in the first half only and was then replaced by Cavani right after the game resumed.
Ibrahimovic, however, proved much more skilled in supporting his colleagues, his care was the one Di Maria sent in a shift from Wiland over the goal in the 52nd minute.
The second goal was scored in the final after an hour of the match, thanks to Cavani, the Uruguayan who scored his sixth goal in the season after Ibrahimovic passed from Maxwell's center.
This goal removed Malmo’s hopes of re-balancing the score and only Wiland’s superb distance stop for rejection David Luizined the final score before new entry Ezequiel Lavezzi was cancelled a goal in the extension.
The Norwegian coach of the Malmo team, Age Hareide, later stated that PSG were with a class over and that “The last match we played in the Champions League was last December.”
Since then, we have only played in the Swedish league, which does not rise to the same level.
Qualifications are not enough.
Hats off for PSG.
They did an excellent game.
Glencore raises $2.5 billion from share sales
Swiss mining giant Glencore, hit by falling stock prices on the commodity stock exchange, raised $2.5 billion from the sale of shares as part of a large-scale debt cuts plan.
Glencore, which is listed on the London Stock Exchange, said it had sold new shares worth £1.6 billion to pay off the debt.
After losing 57% of its market value this year, the company is struggling with crashing commodity prices because the decline in China’s economic activity affects demand and causes disaster in the markets.
The preferential subscription right raised the price of Glencore shares on the London Stock Exchange in Wednesday morning transactions.
The stock rose by 2.77% to 131.60 shillings on the FTSE 100 index, which opened at a value of 0.69%.
Glencore has revealed a $2.5 billion share sale as part of wider plans to cover a third of its $30 billion debt.
The company sold the new shares at a price of 125 shillings per share, down 2.4% from Tuesday’s closing price.
He withdrew 1.3 billion shares of the company, representing 9.99% of the group.
Concerns about China’s long-standing stagnant economic growth led to a substantial increase in iron ore prices by about half, and coal, copper and other commodities dropped by 20-40%.
Xi urges more expansion of the global economy
On Tuesday, President Xi Jinping told a reform group that the economy needs to open more widely to the outside world to fuel growth.
“China must commit to attracting foreign investment and expertise and improving its opening policies,” Xi said at the 16th Central Leading Group Meeting for Deepening Overall Reform.
Promoting openness and encouraging reforms will bring new momentum and vitality and make room for economic growth, Xi said.
The Governing Group adopted a series of guidelines, including a negative list of market access regulations, easing customs control policies, encouraging state-owned enterprises to absorb private capital, and reorganizing the resident registration system.
According to the declaration, a negative list will be drawn up that will identify the sectors and areas of activity in which investments are not allowed.
The system will be gradually tested and improved through test programs.
According to the statement, the measure is important because it will give the market a more important role in the allocation of resources, ensuring a legislative-based business environment and providing a wider openness to the market.
State authorities will also weaken controls over the powers they delegate to companies, ensuring that these companies decide how to run their business.
China will also allow border regions to explore new models of cross-border economic cooperation and new mechanisms to promote regional growth.
In an attempt to open up state-controlled sectors, several sectors will be open to private investment.
“The state authorities will not change their foreign investment policy and will protect the legitimate interests of foreign-invested companies and provide them with better services,” the statement said.
Furthermore, it will be easier for foreign nationals to apply for permanent residence permits or so-called green cards, optimising requirements and streamlining the application process.
The meeting also discussed guaranteeing the right to practice lawyers and educating judges and prosecutors.
Prime Minister Li Keqiang and leaders Liu Yunshan and Zhang Gaoli also attended the meeting, according to a statement made after the meeting.
Education unions disagree with government proposal to raise wages by 10%
Negotiations between Prime Minister Victor Ponta and the leaders of the trade unions in Education have not reached any results, the Government proposing a salary increase of 10% from 1 December, with payment to 1 January 2016, and the trade unions wanted a 15% increase from November, or a 20% increase from December.
The discussions took place at the Victoria Palace on Tuesday evening, with the Prime Minister accompanied by the Minister of Education, Sorin Cimpeanu, the Minister of Finance, Eugen Teodorovici and the Minister of Labour, Rovana Plumb.
The proposal of the Government today did not satisfy us, otherwise we would not have come into the situation to convene the leadership of our federations.
The 10 percent we were promised today is less than what we expected.
“In fact, these 10 percent are the money that we have stipulated in our agreement with the government last year for 2016,” said Anton Hadar, president of Alma Mater, at the end of the talks.
In the future, health and education will be the areas in which we will invest all the money we have.
According to him, a meeting of the FSLI will take place on Thursday, at which representatives of the Government will also participate to present the proposed salary increase to the representatives of the confederations in the country, and the trade unions will decide whether to accept the offer of the Executive.
The prime minister also told the trade unions that the government is trying to send the salary law to parliament as soon as possible so that it can come into force on December 1.
The normative act provides for the increase of salaries in the educational system by 25% of the total increase of 70%, the increase provided in the document to be made gradually, in the next four years.
Victor Ponta also promised the trade unions to acquit all court sentences in 2016.
Migration crisis: tragedy in the Aegean Sea
At least 22 migrants drowned in Turkish territorial waters on Tuesday after a boat crashed.
Among the victims are 11 women and five children, according to Yahoo News.
The boat was in the Aegean Sea and headed to the Greek island of Kos.
The Turkish Coast Guard said it was able to rescue 249 people on board the ship, but their nationality is still unknown.
Earlier on Monday, two other people died trying to cross the Aegean Sea.
In the weekend, 34 migrants, including four babies and 11 children, drowned off the Greek island of Farmakonisi, located 15 kilometers off the Turkish coast.
The situation was similar: the boat carried more people than its capacity, so it sank.
The route has become popular lately for immigrants who want to escape war and hard life from countries like Syria or Iraq.
More than 100 stewardesses fired because they were too fat
Air India has fired approximately 130 flight attendants for being overweight, the airline said at the end of last week.
The state-owned company said the decision was taken for security reasons and recent government regulations, but critics said the measure was "ridiculous" and "shockingly sexist," the Washington Post.
The mass dismissal is the latest in a ten-year battle between the company and the more fulfilling stewardesses.
The weight limit for these dates back to the 1980s, when Air India began to use graphs with the ideal weight and height.
In 2006, Air India fired nine stewardesses considered "exceptionally overweight" because this "may have an effect on reflexes and impede the agility needed to carry out emergency measures."
The stewardesses sued the company, won and were re-employed, but the company fired them again in 2009.
“All efforts to make them lose weight have failed,” a company spokesman said.
A star footballer gives lessons to Gigi Becali: What decision he made
A star footballer teaches Gigi Becali about promoting young players.
If the champion's financier decided to close the football academy in which he had invested a considerable sum, the founder Paul Papp shut down a football school.
The “Paul Papp” academy will operate in Dej city, with the locals waiting for a first selection.
I am extremely happy that I have come to this stage, to start the football academy that bears my name.
For me, it’s extremely important to find talented kids who can play football without any worries at training.
There is only one thing they need to do: play football.
Technical details don’t have to be your concern.
They need to value their talent.
This is what Paul Papp Football Academy wants to do.
"I am also waiting for Mayor Costan Morar at the first selection of the children, to show them that he is with them," Papp told dejean.ro.
At the Academy are expected children up to 11 years of age.
The whole party wants to rule.
PSD interim president Liviu Dragnea said on Tuesday that the whole party wants to remain in government, and, if the prime minister wants, at the PSD Congress this decision will be formalized.
I understood that Mr. Ponta expects this decision from the PSD Congress, everyone wants to govern, the whole party.
If we want to formalize it by a congressional decision, we will do that too.
There will be no emotion about it.
“There have not been elements, voices in the party, opinions in the party that give someone the insecurity of the government or that give someone the impression that someone in the party does not want the PSD to remain in the government, in the current government, with the current prime minister,” Dragnea said at the end of the meeting of the Permanent National Bureau of the PSD.
The SPD has announced when it will hold Congress - what will then be decided
Prime Minister Victor Ponta said on Tuesday that it is important that, at the PSD Congress, beyond the choice of leadership, a clear message be given whether the government is to continue or if the party decides to move into opposition.
Dragnea: I will announce on Monday if I will run for Congress
On the other hand, Liviu Dragnea will announce next Monday whether he will run for a leadership position at the upcoming Congress.
I will sing, on Monday, after the Executive Committee, if the date of the Congress is also set.
“I will announce if I will run for a position in the leadership of the party,” Dragnea said at the end of Tuesday’s meeting of the Permanent National Bureau of the PSD.
Asked if the hesitation regarding the announcement of the candidacy was related to his file, Dragnea said he did not have this problem.
I don’t have the problem you’re referring to, but I think it’s fair and honest to all my colleagues in the party to announce or not a candidacy to me when the date of Congress is formally established.
“That’s the only motivation,” said Dragnea.
The overwhelming majority of the social-democratic branches have proposed an extraordinary PSD Congress on 11 October, and the exact date of the Congress will be decided on Monday by the party’s Executive Committee.

Italian man caught at Bors Customs with immigrants hidden in TIR
Two Sri Lankan citizens were spotted at the Bors Customs on Monday as they were trying to cross the border illegally, hidden in the semi-trailer of a car car driven by an Italian citizen.
The investigation found that the two men had paid the driver 4,000 euros to be transported to France, the French border police said.
At the specific check, border guards noticed a large travel bag in the truck’s cabin containing personal items for several people, so they carried out a thorough check on the means of transport.
On this occasion, border guards found, hidden in the semi-trailer of the car, among the plastic loops, two men.
The investigation found that the two men, aged 28, were Sri Lankan nationals and asylum seekers in Romania.
“In the investigation, the young men stated that they intended to arrive in France, so they contacted a local, through which they met the Italian driver, who offered to transport them to their destination, where they would receive 2,000 euros per person,” the border police said in a statement.
The two migrants were charged with "criminal work in terms of committing the crime of attempted fraudulent crossing of the state border".
Pompeo B., a 45-year-old Italian citizen who was driving a Romanian-registered Renault Magnum carrier carrying plastic sticks for an Italian company, was also detained for 24 hours, before being presented to the Bihor Tribunal with a proposal for pre-arrest.
How satisfied are Romanians in couples: Men versus women
Most Romanians are happy with their relationships.
This is the conclusion of a study conducted on the occasion of the arrival in Romania of John Gray, the famous author of the bestseller "Men are from Mars, Women are from Venus".
A total of 62% of respondents say they are “very satisfied” and “satisfied” with the overall quality of their relationship.
“H, 18% appear to be ‘lightly dissatisfied’ and ‘very dissatisfied’ in their relationship as a couple, and another 18% say they are ‘suitable’,” the study concludes, according to a statement released on Tuesday.
The situation is slightly different when the responses of men and women are looked at separately.
Thus, 28% of men are very satisfied, 39% satisfied, 17% agree, 6% very dissatisfied and 8% slightly dissatisfied.
As for women, 33% declared themselves satisfied, 24% very satisfied, 8% very dissatisfied, 14% slightly dissatisfied and 19% chose the right category.
When we look at the degree of satisfaction (positive), we will notice that men are more satisfied.
In terms of the neutral state, we see a difference of two percent.
“Likewise, in the very unsatisfied situation, the biggest difference is in the slightly unsatisfied response where we see a difference of 6 percent,” the statement said.
The study also found that a quarter of Romanians (26%) spend an hour or less together, 18% spend between five and eight hours together, and 45% between two and four hours.
Romanians feel they need a little more adventure in their lives (24%), followed by affection (21%), money (21%), security (20%), new (19%), sex (19%), respect 18%, trust 17%, pleasure 17%, connection 17%, knowledge 16%, protection 14%, importance 14%, learning 12%, freedom 11%, self-knowledge 10% and control 7%".
The study was conducted by Extreme Training from 1 June to 1 September on 1,369 people with a calculated error margin of 2.6%.
Europe is ashamed again.
German Deputy Chancellor Sigmar Gabriel said on Tuesday that Europe "has become ashamed" after the failure of Monday's ministerial meeting in Brussels on the distribution of refugees within the European Union.
“Tonight (on Monday evening), Europe has once again become shameful,” said Sigmar Gabriel, who is also the Minister of Economy in the government of Chancellor Angela Merkel.
Earlier, German Interior Minister Thomas de Maiziere suggested cuts in EU structural funds for countries that reject refugee quotas.
European interior ministers meeting in Brussels on Monday failed to reach an agreement on the mandatory allocation of 120,000 refugees, requested last week by the European Commission to deal with one of Europe's worst migration crises since 1945.

Thousands of people passed over to the coffin with the dead body of Corneliu Vadim Tudor, so many people were not present at the Church of St. George than at the sanctification of the lodge or at the Grand Temple of St. Nicholas, said the parish priest Emil Caramizaru on Wednesday.
Hundreds of people of all ages are waiting at the row, which extends from the entrance to the church to the side streets, to pass through to the catapult on which was the coffin with Corneliu Vadim Tudor’s lifeless body.
People waited about an hour to reach St. George's New Church, where groups of 40 people entered.
About 300 people per hour passed through the coffin with the dead body of Corneliu Vadim Tudor on Wednesday.

He was the founder of the Greater Romania Party, a former member of the European Parliament and a former senator.
Coach Darren Cahill
Simona Halep is facing a crucial decision for her career, having to choose whether to continue working with coach Darren Cahill.
The pair worked this year in the Adidas Player Development program, the Australian technician being alongside the romance only on major tournaments.
Simona had only words of praise for Cahill, who seems to be the only coach who managed to impose himself in the face of the capricious sport.
But Adidas's program will end at the end of this year, and Halep has to decide whether to offer Cahill a consistent contract or whether to quit.
We do not yet know exactly what will happen.
We talk and see.
“After Singapore, I will be able to give a response,” Simona told a news conference.
Darren Cahill is one of the most expensive tennis coaches in the world, claiming a contract of about $1 million a year.
In addition, the Australian is also a sports commentator, a profession he would not want to give up at the moment.
The last race Simona and Cahill will work together is the Champions Tour in Singapore.
It wasn’t normal, I wasn’t respected.
Victor Piturca revealed how he separated from the Romanian national team last autumn.
The former coach confessed that he did not agree with FRF president, Razvan Burleanu, after he took the place of Mircea Sandu, and thus made the decision to leave the national.
Eventually, he proposed to the head of the Federation to substantially increase his salary to stay, but was rejected.
At the moment, I’m not sorry for leaving the country.
Then I felt sorry, I left a job behind.
I thought it was good for me and I think it was good for me.
What happened to me when I was a selector was not normal, I was not respected, my job was not respected.
I worked well with those before the Federation, but when Burleanu came to the Federation he came up with a preconceived idea, he didn’t know me, he learned different opinions from the press about me.
It didn’t change me because it was very hard at the time, with the results I had, plus the financial situation in the middle.
We continued the work, everything went very well and he probably changed his ideas too.
But I wanted to leave.
If he wanted me to stay, I offered him a contract extension.
We have about 400 and some thousand euros a year, I would have about 600 thousand euros.
I did not talk to Burleanu, but with his right hand.
“He agreed, but only if we finished first in the group,” Victor Piturca told Dolce Sport.
Victor Piturca resigned from Romania’s national team last fall, despite the team’s good results in the Euro 2016 preliminars.
The technician accepted the proposal to train in Saudi Arabia, immediately taking over the Al Ittihad group.
Armor and water cannons at the border
Hungarian police have deployed Humvee military vehicles equipped with machine guns to the border with Serbia after violent clashes on Wednesday, when water and tear gas guns were used against migrants who wanted to enter from Serbia, despite Hungary’s fencing.
At least 20 police officers and two children were injured in clashes, Russia Today reports.
So far, 20 police officers have been injured and the ambulance service has picked up two children who were injured after they were thrown over the security fence.
“We will rebuild the fence and strengthen it, and we will protect Hungary’s security by all means,” said Hungarian Prime Minister’s security adviser, Gyorgy Bakondi.
The police tried to control with water and tear gas cannons the crowd that threw plastic bottles, stones and floor pieces.
Authorities have that dozens of migrants broke the fence at the crossing between the cities of Roszke and Horgos and managed to enter the country.
Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto has called on Serbia to take action against “very aggressive” migrants on the common border.
There are reports that the Serbs have also supplemented their law enforcement forces at the border.
Budapest suspended the border crossing from Roszke-Horgos for 30 days.
Hungary is in a concerted action to close its borders to block the access of migrants.
While on Tuesday he announced that besides the fence on the border with Serbia, a fence will also be erected on the border with Romania, to the fierce protests of Bucharest, on Wednesday, the Hungarian prime minister announced the erection of a fence on the border with Croatia.
The rare disease a man suffers from
American Nick Hess was suspected by his family that he was an alcoholic, his wife even filming him when he was thirsty, could barely stand on his feet and his words were difficult to understand.
Although the 35-year-old said he did not drink alcohol, it was visible that he was drunk.
When she first accused me of being drunk without drinking, I thought she was crazy.
"But his friends and family thought, 'Maybe he drinks alone, he's a secret alcoholic,'" he told Mirror.
When he saw his wife’s footage with him, the man from Columbus, Ohio, simply didn’t recognize himself: “I was looking in my eyes and I wasn’t there.”
“It was terrible, I didn’t remember anything.”
In addition, his wife, who, despite doubting him for a while, eventually went with him to countless doctors, remembers that Nick’s breath also smelled like alcohol.
The moment that brought Nick the most to his mind was when, after a minor accident, when he was hit by another car, it was discovered that he had an alcoholemia three times the legal limits, although he had only drank one beer the night before.
After years and countless investigations, it was discovered that Nick suffered from an extremely rare disease, “Auto-brewery syndrome.”
Basically, the body causes all the carbohydrates consumed to ferment, turning into alcohol.
The one who suspected this could be Nick’s illness was his wife.
The disease has no cure yet, but since he quit carbohydrates, Nick has never had such episodes.
He destroyed a Mercedes with a golf cruise
A South Korean man destroyed his car, a Mercedes S63, in protest of the services he received from his dealer.
The man “attacked” his car with a golf crusher, causing enough damage for the car to be taken out of use.
The whole scene was filmed and the video reached the internet for the fun of those who watched it.
The man claimed that the car has defects that endanger his life and his family.
His anger arose when the dealer he bought the car from did not solve his problem as agreed.
The government approved on Wednesday the "National Immigration Strategy for the period 2015-2018" and the "Action Plan for the current year", documents considered to be "another stage that Romania is going through as part of the efforts to modernize the immigration management process on the national territory", according to a press release.
The strategy aims to effectively manage the immigration phenomenon, including general strategic objectives, specific objectives and directions of action that reflect the policies established at European level, adapted to national realities.
In view of the problems faced by the States in the immediate neighbourhood of Romania, measures are considered for the unitary and coherent management of situations determined by the possible appearance of an influx of illegal immigrants into the territory of Romania, generated by situations of crisis of a political, social, economic or military nature.
“The Romanian authorities will contribute to the creation of a flexible admission system, but at the same time will pay special attention to citizens coming from countries with a potential migrationist or that may harm national security,” the source added.
The strategy identifies a number of factors that can influence immigration and asylum, includingining the conflict situation in Syria, reactivating the conflict in Iraq,ining an unstable situation in the areas bordering Romania (Ukraine, Transnistria), perpetuating and increasing intensity of the Israeli-Palestinian armed conflict.
On the other hand, the document also sets a number of general strategic objectives related to immigration, such as: promoting legal migration, stricter controls of the legality of third-country nationals’ stay on the Romanian territory and the appropriate application of removal and restrictive measures, improvement of the national asylum system.
The national strategy shall also include specific objectives relevant to the transposition and implementation of the general strategic objectives.
These include: facilitating access to the Romanian territory of third-party nationals who meet the needs of employment, favouring access of third-party nationals to higher education institutions in Romania for the fields and professions identified as deficient.
Regarding the 2015 Action Plan, the Government appreciates that it represents “a means by which concrete activities are established that will lead to the creation of a flexible system for stopping the growing migrationist phenomenon”.
Romania at the top of the European labour market
Latvia, Romania and Bulgaria recorded the highest increase in total labor costs among EU member states in the second quarter of the year, compared to the same period in 2014, according to data published on Wednesday by the European Statistical Office (Eurostat).
The index refers to the employee expenses of employers.
Between April and June 2015, the total cost of labour rose by 1.9% in the European Union and by 1.6% in the euro area.
Romania, third in the EU in the increase in labour cost
The highest increases were in Latvia (7.9%), Romania (7.7%), Bulgaria (6.8%), Estonia (5,5%) and Lithuania (4.3%).
The only EU countries where the hourly cost of labour decreased in the second quarter of this year were Greece (minus 2.9%), Cyprus (minus 1.2%) and Italy (minus 0.4%).
The increase in labor costs in Romania between April and June 2015 is mainly due to the increase in hourly labor costs in industry and services, by 7.9% and 7.6%, respectively.
In the construction sector, Romania recorded an increase of 5.8% of the hourly cost of labour.
TVR leadership report rejected in committees: Stelian Tanase risks dismissal
The Parliament’s cultural committees rejected on Wednesday the report on the activity of the Romanian Television Society’s Board of Directors for 2014.
Seventeen MPs voted in favour of the report, one against the rejection (Senator Varujan Vosganian) and one abstained.
The text of the report shall be forwarded to the Standing Offices gathered.
They will decide, probably next week.
This will be discussed in the next plenary session.
"I think that given this situation it will be done relatively quickly," said the chairman of the Senate Committee on Culture, Georgica Severin.
He added that it was "good sense" that the TVR leadership was present at this meeting, as no representative of the TVR leadership was present at the meeting of the Culture Committees.
It was a good sense that the TVR leadership was present because no one here was subjected to personal attacks or anything like that.
The invitation was made to the members of the CA yesterday, with an approximate hour that we did not know the time, but today, after the meeting of the offices gathered, I personally sent a fax to the TVR leadership inviting her.
I believe that when you are summoned, you are a budget worker, paid from public taxes and you are summoned to a meeting of the committees gathered even if you do not like live.
"Because it is your duty of service, you are in an institution under the Parliament," Severin said after the meeting of the Parliament's cultural committees.
He added that during the meeting the financial aspects of the institution were discussed on the basis of the negative opinion of the Budget Committees.
The debts we saw and we saw how they continued, it came up with the idea that this year would have been the day, but they did not pay out of the historical ones.
"I remind you that it is not my fault or the fault of anyone else in these committees that the agreement with the banks and the tax authorities was lost, there are clear management problems," Severin said.
He added that after the activity report will be rejected by the plenary meeting there will be elections for a new Board of Directors, which will elect the director general of the institution.
I do not know who will be nominated for this position.
Miracles will not happen.
It is important to make political decisions in order for this institution to function.
I am not the man to lie to you, to tell you that there will be a genius who will sit in the queue here and fight.
I hope that those who decide, the plenary of the Parliament, by their vote will elect with much reason the people who will lead the TVR.
There must be people who know what is happening there, have experience and have a lot of fairness and respect for the institution and tradition.
I don’t know who he will be, if you ask me what qualities he should have – I feel good about the attitude towards employees because it’s a scam of petitions that come from employees, complaints, dismissals.
"When you receive such notifications 50, 60, 70, something is rotten and we are talking about the financial situation that is a disaster," he concluded.
Although he did not appear in Parliament, TVR President-Director-General, Stelian Tanase, sent a letter to the Chairman of the Chamber of Deputies, Valeriu Zgonea, in which he requested that Parliament consider a series of measures that could lead to saving and guaranteeing the economic and political independence of public television, including the indexation of the TV fee.
In the letter, Stelian Tanase requested, in addition to the indexation of the TV fee, the amendment and supplementation of HG 978/2003 on the fee for the public television service, in order to update the provisions to the level of technological changes at the moment, as well as to regulate the procedure on control in the field of payment of the TV fee and the finding of contraventions and the application of sanctions and penalties.
He also wants to issue a provision providing for the extension of the obligation for all electricity suppliers to become SRTv’s mandatees for the collection of the TV fee, by involving ANRE in regulating this activity.
In its view, it is necessary to set a maximum ceiling of 5% of the commission on receipts.
Stelian Tanase demands the reduction of the VAT rate for the activities specific to the public television station and the contribution for CNC from 15% to the level of 3%, but also the amendment of Law 41/1994, in the sense of the possibility of receiving budgetary appropriations/financing for the purchase of licenses for major cultural and sports events - World Cup, Golden Cerf, Eurovision.
He argues that SRTv will go into insolvency in the coming months given that labor legislation obliges the employer to enforce court decisions, even if they are not final, and salary rights are honored with priority over any other obligation.
The TVR administration has constantly made efforts to reduce staff and TV production expenses.
“Thus, travel and other cost-generating activities were reduced, a number of commercial contracts were renegotiated, and at the end of July TVR News was closed,” the letter reads.
Tanase believes that the disastrous financial situation cannot be remedied by his own efforts.
“Without the support of the state institutions – Government, Parliament, Presidency – Romanian Television will be, sooner or later, unable to fulfill its public mission,” the letter reads.
The head of the House of Deputies decided to send the letter to the Culture Committee.
Vasile Blaga's son sent to court
Vasile Blaga’s son-in-law, Ionut Andrei Rudeanu, was sent to trial on Wednesday by the prosecutors of the Prosecutor’s Office near the Bucharest Court of Appeal.
He is accused of tax evasion, in a case with damage of approximately 600,000 euros, and is under judicial control.
Andrei Rudeanu was arrested on May 22.
He founded the security firm Axis Corporate Security SRL with his mother in April 2009, a year after marrying Vasile Blaga’s daughter, Agathe.
The investigation revealed that, in order to avoid paying taxes and taxes to the state budget, representatives of a company specialized in the provision of security services would have created a criminal circuit, consisting of several commercial companies, through which fictitious transactions were identified.
"In fact, in the company's accounting, fictitious purchases of services were recorded, which, in reality, were not provided, the state budget being thus damaged by about 600,000 euros," the Romanian police explained in a press release.
The Seychelles determined the fate of Sanmartean
The Al-Ittihad seiks decided the fate of the midfielder Lucian Sanmartean.
Although the Arab media announces that the separation of Sanmartean from Ittihad is imminent, entrepreneur Ladislau Boloni’s agent, Arcadie Zaporojanu, says this will not happen again.
Boloni is very pleased with Sanmartean.
Lucian plays the title match and does it well.
The Seychelles also realized that he was the best and that it would be wrong to give up on him.
It would have been possible to bring another player, much better, but nothing came out.
"There have been several discussions, such as that with Mbark Boussoufa, but nothing has been concretized," Zaporojanu told Digi Sport.
Lucian Sanmartean arrived at Al-Ittihad earlier this year.
Ilie Sarbu was elected Vice-President of the Court of Auditors
On Wednesday, Parliament voted to appoint PSD Senator Ilie Sarbu, the father-in-law of Prime Minister Victor Ponta, as Vice-President of the Audit Authority of the Court of Auditors.
According to Mediafax, 290 votes for and 108 against were recorded.
Voting was secret with ballots.
The PNL representatives were the only ones who voted against this proposal, reports Digi24.
By the way, the liberals criticized Sarbu’s appointment in this position and announced that they would challenge it to the CCR, as he has a file at the DNA, but does not have the necessary training and experience.
Ilie Sarbu has 30 days, according to the law, to resign from the Senate, because the new position at the Court of Auditors does not allow him to do politics.
The PSD senator will serve as vice president of the Audit Authority at the Court of Auditors, which remained free after Ioan Anton was removed, following a decision of the Constitutional Court in September 2014, which found that he was appointed unconstitutional.
One of the most sexy actors in the world: I grew up in the kitchen
As Bradley Cooper is about to play the role of a chef in the movie "Burnt", the actor made a revelation that his fans did not expect.
In a recent interview, he said he grew up more in the kitchen: "I worked much of my life as a chef."
He revealed that he had been working in the kitchen since he was 15, when he was working for a Greek restaurant, and then, in college, he would continue on the same path.
The actor explained that his mother is of Italian origin, so all his childhood he cooked with his Italian grandmother, reports ContactMusic.
Asked what plans he had for the future at that time, Cooper said he was never the type of man to make plans for five years, "not even two."
“It’s not motivating at all for me to have a map,” he said.
“I have dreams, things you’d laugh at if I told you,” he said, saying that what he wanted from childhood has come true.
At the age of 40, the actor has admitted that he sees himself in the near future directing, taking the model of Clint Eastwood, who started directing at that age.
Ponta, accused of uncontrolled slander and irrational statements
Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto strongly condemned Romanian Prime Minister Victor Ponta’s assertions that Hungarian political decision-makers are “not better than those in Syria, Libya or other countries from which refugees flee.”
“Yesterday, Victor Ponta lost his self-control and, with his irrational statements, he offends the whole of Hungary,” the Hungarian foreign minister said in a statement.
Civilized European politicians do not say such uncontrolled slanders.
"His remarks have only one explanation: it has completely lost its support in domestic policy in Romania," he added.
In a post on Facebook on Tuesday evening, Prime Minister Victor Ponta said he wanted to draw attention and sanction the behavior of high-ranking Hungarian government officials, who, in his opinion, "are a disgrace to the culture and values of the European Union."
I do not want to respond to the challenges coming from Hungarian government representatives.
“They are a disgrace to the culture and values of the European Union; both in anti-Semitic attitudes, and in the treatment of minorities of all kinds, and now during the refugee crisis!” said Ponta on Facebook.
The Romanian prime minister added that he is a supporter of rational and sustainable solutions to the refugee crisis, assessing that brutality and aggressive laws will not solve the problem.
The swallow, aggressive laws, prisons and brutality will not solve the problem – they will only look like in Hungary, in the heart of Europe, there are no better political decision makers than those in Syria, Libya or other countries from which these refugees flee!
“I believe in solidarity, in rational and sustainable solutions and especially in the superiority of European values – what we see in Hungary in recent days is in total contradiction with these goals and values!” he said.
Earlier on Tuesday, Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto called Romanian Prime Minister Victor Ponta’s remarks on Hungary’s handling of the refugee crisis “simple lies” and said those statements were inappropriate for a leader of the 21st century.
The head of Hungarian diplomacy also mentioned on Tuesday that the Romanian prime minister’s “extremist and false remarks” refer to the domestic political crisis in Romania and said that Budapest expects an apology from the Romanian side.
Szijjarto referred to a statement made Monday by Prime Minister Victor Ponta.
What I have always said and say is that I am against xenophobic discourse the idea of closing borders, that all who come are terrorists, they are Middle Ages fools, and I am totally opposed to this approach.
If we can get more, we will get, the problem is our logistical ability to treat those people as people, not how our Hungarian neighbors treat them, with bat and inseriat.
“I disagree with this,” the Romanian chief executive said at a press conference in Targu-Jiu.
On Tuesday, Peter Szijjarto announced that the Budapest government has decided to start preparations on the ground for the extension of the fence it is building on the border with Serbia on the border with Romania, in order to cope with a possible change in the route used by migrants.
Subsequently, Prime Minister Victor Ponta said that Hungary’s decision to erect a fence at the borders did not solve anything of the refugee problem and “tracks Hungary out of Europe.”
What is the relationship between Osama bin Laden and the fall of the crane in Mecca?
Saudi authorities said the Saudi giant Binladin Group, belonging to Osama bin Laden's family, was "partly responsible" for the crash of a crane on Friday at the Great Mosque in Mecca, killing 107 people.
According to an investigation committee, the company "failed to comply with safety rules," the Saudi news agency SPA.
The company’s executives were banned from leaving the country until the investigation was completed.
The company will also be excluded from new contracts.
The construction company is owned by the family of the former leader of the terrorist network Al-Qaeda, Osama bin Laden.
The company was founded by Osama bin Laden’s father 80 years ago and is now run by former terrorist leader Bakr’s brother.
Binladen Group has been working for 4 years to expand the Great Mosque to accommodate more pilgrims.
The accident occurred on Friday night during a storm when a crane, probably unbalanced by strong winds, crashed on the east side of the roof of the Great Mosque in Mecca.
As a result of the accident, 107 people died and 400 were injured.
How they shut the mouths of protesters
Considered by many the greatest Romanian footballer in history, Gica Hagi was labeled, after his retirement, as a weak coach, who may not be able to perform well in the new posture.
After unfortunate experiences with the national team, Steaua or Galatasaray, Hagi took over, a year ago, the role of coach at Future Constanta, the team he patronizes.
After a fixed year of taking over the team, King has demonstrated that he is able to turn a team fighting for rescue from a downturn into a top team.
Thus, after a year, Future recorded, with Hagi coach, 16 wins, 11 drawbacks and 11 losses.
It’s one of the top teams fighting in the European Cups.
Things have taken an even better turn for Future this season, as the team reached second place in League 1, with 19 points, one less than the leader Astra Giurgiu.
The future also has the best attack in League 1, with 20 goals (equal to Astra), more than twice as much as Star.
On the other hand, even though bringing more experienced players to the team, Hagi continued the policy of promoting young people, and recently in the start team appeared names such as Ianis Hagi or Hodorogea.
The club’s policy has made Futuro a team to be followed for overseas teams, so Hagi sold this summer 1.5 million euros – Ianis Hagi (Fiorentina – 1 million euros) and Alexandru Mitrita (Bari – 500 thousand euros).
Along with Star, Future is the only profitable team in League 1, according to data from the Commercial Register.
In the refugee crisis, Romania has so far played like a small country.
It’s a legitimate strategy, but after that you can’t ask to be treated as the seventh country of the EU.
The big countries come up with solutions for the entire EU, says Cristian Ghinea, member of the board of directors of the Romanian Centre for European Policies.
In an interview with Ziare.com, Cristian Ghinea showed that Europe cannot be transformed into a fortress, and the purely police means will not work in this crisis: "Maybe we have doubts about the quality of the values with which these people come."
But there are masses that have started and we cannot reverse history.
Migration is a reality to which we must adapt as best we can and adapt them to us.
According to Cristian Ghinea, we are in an extremely emotional time, when politicians feel the need to show their muscles.
Once it passes, Europeans will not be willing to give up free movement, but the rules in the Schengen area must be changed: "Schengen is now like an animal created in another era and not adapted to the current situation."
Where are we in the refugee crisis after this JAI council that, in fact, hasn’t solved anything?
It is clear that the President of the European Commission in agreement with Donald Tusk did not want to force a vote in the Council.
All the predictions were that they would have the necessary votes.
Before the Lisbon Treaty, the UNI applied the unanimity principle and any state could block any decision.
Therefore, things have been very little integrated in the field of justice and domestic affairs.
After Lisbon, the normal procedure applies, in which the Commission has the initiative, and the Council approves it by the vote of 55% of the member states, or 16 representing 65% of the EU population.
The calculations said the votes were there.
But they did not want to go ahead.
Because it is a sensitive issue, rejectional reactions have appeared in Germany against Chancellor Merkel’s openness policy and did not want it to appear in many countries as a reaction of the type “the EU sends us migrants on our heads”.
They have therefore delayed, but the problem remains because, obviously, this wave creates a huge problem for Schengen governance and we will probably witness major changes there in the coming period.
So the mandatory quotas were not really removed, but the subject was just left to cool down?
Yes, on the other hand, we are talking about a greater involvement of Frontex in the management of external borders, which means a shift from the individual responsibility of the members who are at the external borders of Schengen to the responsibility of the EU agencies.
Greece’s border with Turkey is also Germany’s de facto border with Turkey, and this wave of migrants has set the boundaries of the old Schengen system.
Per the Dublin principle, according to which migrants are the responsibility of the country they first enter, will be abandoned because it is not sustainable.
If Greece does, you can’t say that it’s Greece’s business.
The problem is common.
Just because the problem is common, is a solution possible without a precise, even mandatory, mechanism of sharing the effort of receiving?
No one knows exactly how the mandatory quotas will work if they are reached.
For there remains a question: what do you do with a man who does not want to come to Romania or Portugal, but to Sweden or Germany?
I don’t think European countries will take up migrants: you go to country X or country Y.
They are likely to reach a single filtering centre, in Greece or Turkey, where asylum applications will be processed.
We are working on such solutions.
But the problem does not have a simple solution.
There are countries that have decades of experience trying to integrate migrants, there are countries with no experience, like Romania, where the issue of migrants will increase the xenophobic current.
The truth is that we are talking about millions of people who are in Turkey, in Lebanon, in Jordan, who are in precarious camps and who have just begun to leave for Europe.
One estimate says that only 10% have managed to leave, in winter it is difficult to cross the Mediterranean, but next year we expect a wave even greater.
What do we do with these people?
My prediction is that we will get used to this problem, we will not look at it so catastrophically from a media point of view.
Talk about countries with more or less experience.
Do you think there is any place where it has really managed to integrate large groups from a non-European culture?
I look at the Maghrebis in France, the Turks in Germany, they are still enclaved.
I would not go to radical statements.
Of course, their integration is more difficult than other waves of migration, but that doesn’t mean they don’t integrate at all.
It remains an unintegrated part that creates major social problems in France, Germany, Britain.
But purely police means will not work.
Building a fortress in Europe is illusory.
The mechanisms of integration into European societies must be pursued.
There were some mistakes here.
We need to be more pretentious.
Let us ask these people to learn the language, to try to take on the values, not to stay with one foot in Europe and one in their home country, bringing the rest of their family, including through marriages of convenience.
But the imminent problem of these people must be separated from the long-term problem of their integration.
If others have failed in long-term integration, it does not mean that we should look at them flooding in the Mediterranean.
We may have doubts about the quality of the values with which these people come.
And if there is an intervention in Syria, which I do not believe, it does not mean that the country will rebuild overnight and you can take them back.
Until there are solutions, we see fortresses within Europe.
Borders are closed, walls are erected, border controls are reintroduced in the Schengen area.
Is the European Union at risk?
The European project as such, not the Schengen area as it was built, yes.
It was built quite minimally and arranging the rules so that the pressure was too great on the countries where these migrants first set foot.
We go free, but each has his problems.
In the face of such a wave it cannot be so, because some countries do not face it.
When there are such waves of emotion, politicians want to show that they are doing something, but in the long run nothing changes.
After the attacks in France, we do not have much more draconian anti-terror legislation in the EU than we had last year.
It’s a wave of public emotion that settles in both directions.
And it’s so unstable from week to week that you can’t make decisions based on it.
We have a lot of talk, many warlike statements from politicians at home under pressure to be virile.
And then you have the dramatic case of the drowned child in Turkey and the public is excited.
After the public emotion passes, we will return to the reasons why we created this space, this freedom of movement that is not only for people, but also for goods.
This is the real European market.
And I don’t think Europeans will give up this principle of freedom of movement.
That there are other rules is something else.
Schengen is now like an animal created in another era and not adapted to the current situation.
How has Turkey played so far in this crisis?
Like a small country that thinks that if it pulls the cap on its eyes and closes its ears, the subject disappears.
Faced with the reality of the waves of migrants, you can choose to be part of the solution or say that it is not your small country problem.
We did that, it’s a legitimate strategy, but after that you can’t ask to be treated as the seventh country of the EU.
You are not, you are not playing at the level of the big country.
The big countries come up with solutions for the whole EU, good or bad, we don’t now discuss their quality.
Just as Poland did.
On the other hand, the effect of this crisis is that the Romanians’ appetite for Schengen will decrease considerably.
President Iohannis says it may be good that we have not already entered.
So we move from the despair of entering to a more pragmatic position, but the goal remains.
There is, of course, a risk if Romania and Bulgaria enter Schengen that migrants will see us as an alternative route.
This does not mean that there is a reason not to enter Schengen anymore, but to be more pragmatic.
Romania will be part of Schengen, and Schengen will exist, but transformed in the sense that the external borders will become common responsibility, there will be single rules for accepting migrants, single rules for deportation for those who do not receive asylum, single rules for countries considered safe.
The Ukrainian president said that since Russia shifted its attention to Syria, no one has died.
Is there a connection between the two outbreaks, a game of Russia?
Russia has a frustrated power behavior.
She believes that being a great power is to confound Americans and Europeans.
From this point of view, yes, there is a link.
Without the military and financial efforts of the Putin regime, the Assad regime would probably have collapsed long ago.
And it was good to collapse before its main opponent was Islamic State.
It has been a two-year fight between the Assad regime and moderate secular and Muslim militias backed by the Gulf countries and the West.
Then the Islamic State rose, and now we don’t know if we want the Assad regime to fall.
Russia could complicate things, but it cannot participate in the solution.
It creates foci of instability and chaos that it cannot close.
But you are only powerful if you have solutions.
Playing off-side is just a strategy to gain time.
Probably Putin is waiting for offers, pressing the buttons to resolve the situation.
The offers do not come because the world is not convinced that he can solve in one way or another the issues he has created.
But I disagree with the theories that these people are driven by an invisible hand.
Let’s not see Putin stronger than he is.
What button will appear soon?
Millions of Facebook users have become accustomed to the "Like" button, and now the representatives of the social network are preparing another opposite, the "Dislike".
Mark Zuckerberg, co-founder and chief executive officer of the company, announced on his account that this button will be available soon, the New York Times reports on its blog.
Zuckerberg said the “Dislike” button would show a shade of what a user feels rather than a mere option.
However, his ad raised the problem that Facebook could become a less friendly place.
Zuckerberg said he wants to avoid the times when someone posts on his account or an important event in life, and someone else will give "dislike".
Users of the network, which has reached 1.5 billion active accounts, have long sought the opportunity to express their negative emotions or empathy with something sad.
Mark Zuckerberg said it is not very comfortable for people to like current events, such as the refugee crisis, or the death of a family member.
“You may not feel comfortable giving like to that post,” the Facebook spokesman said.
The new version of the Facebook button was not well received by everyone.
“There is already enough hatred on Facebook and on social media,” said Atiq Haneef of Afghanistan on the Facebook page of the New York Times, where the article was posted.
“I’ll give ‘Dislike’ to the ‘Dislike’ button,” he said.
Roger Anderson, a microbiologist from Atlanta, argued that there is nothing wrong with this button, encouraging people to have different opinions on Facebook.
Debra Aho Williamson, a social media analyst at eMarketer, said it’s hard to imagine that a single button can convey a complex range of negative emotions.
Moreover, she argues, the election campaign in America is approaching, and the "Dislike" button would create a total disaster.
Only 70 refugees entered Hungary in 24 hours
Hungary has accepted only 70 migrants on Tuesday, a handful of thousands coming massively to its southern border with Serbia, government adviser Gyorgy Bakondi said.
Hungary declared a state of emergency in two counties along the border with Serbia over the course of the day due to the flow of refugees, closing a major border crossing and announcing it will build a fence on its border with Romania.
The move caused a sudden reaction from Serbia.
Even yesterday they said they would seal the border for those who want to cross, but not for those who want to seek asylum.
"As you can see, this is completely different," Serbian refugee minister Aleksandar Vulin said.
Before the new immigration legislation came into force, a record number of 5,809 migrants entered Hungary on Sunday, police said on Monday.
More than 170,000 migrants from the Middle East and Africa entered Hungary from Serbia in 2015.
Many avoid being registered and try to get to the West, especially in Germany.
The “new” headquarters of the district council is standing.
Two companies in insolvency
The massive investments made here in recent years in order to move the institution are about to collapse because they have been stopped several times.
Two major builders who worked here went into insolvency during the works.
The county council headquarters on Vasile Alecsandri Street will collapse on its own.
A year and a half after the consolidation and re-functionalization of the building should have been completed, the work has not reached even half.
A final stage in the building’s epic was completed last days, when the National Council for Dispute Resolution (CNSC) rejected a complaint from the company that wanted to take over the contract for the technical project for the work that is still to be executed.
The original project was prepared by Impex Romcatel SA.
After the insolvency of the constructor and the interruption of the works, the negotiation procedures were initiated without the publication of a notice of participation with Impex Romcatel, the company is to update the technical project, and then a new auction for the works will be organized.
"The negotiations did not conclude with a contract, however, CJ estimating that the proposed form would have disadvantaged the institution," said Răzvan Timofciuc, representative of public relations at CJ.
The CJ’s decision to halt the direct negotiations was appealed in court by Impex Romcatel.
The outgoing tribunal sent the complaint to the CNSC, which rejected it as delayed.
However, this does not mean that CJ can start looking for another designer.
Impex Romcatel has the possibility to appeal the CNSC decision before the Court of Appeal, only after a final judgment of it can be considered to find another designer.
The construction of the building could be resumed as early as next year.
Our intention is to resume the work as soon as possible.
In principle, the rebuilding of the technical project should not take long, but we must reach the conclusion of a contract.
"We are waiting to see whether the CNSC decision will be challenged or not," Timofciuc said.
Work on the consolidation of the former headquarters of the Police Chestura began in 2011.
A first contract for works was terminated in April 2012, after works of RON 4.5 million had been carried out.
The auction was resumed and the contract was awarded by Moldoconstruct SA.
However, the company went into insolvency, and this contract was terminated after payments of RON 1.5 million were made.
Work has so far been carried out at about 50%.
Initially, the works of consolidation, re-functionalization and roofing of the building were estimated at RON 7.7 million.
"Ready, I say it all!" - the statement that could incriminate the former chief of the Cadastre
One of the employees involved in the scandalous case at the Cadastre Office signed an agreement to acknowledge the facts, against imprisonment with postponement.
Most likely, his statements will incriminate the other accused, headed by former chief Narciza Nedelcu.
An adviser at the Office of Cadastre and Real Estate Advertising (OCPI) Iasi, accused by DNA in a corruption case, admitted to his deeds.
The agreement on the recognition of facts signed by Dumitru Dascălu was registered yesterday at the Iasi Tribunal, the judges determined to give a solution in this case on September 29.
Dumitru Daniel Dascălu was accused of intellectual falsehood in continuous form and agreed to execute two years of imprisonment with postponement, as well as work for the community.
Regarding the facts charged to Dascălu, the prosecutors specified that he, as a counselor of the Cadastre Office, together with other colleagues, “falsified several protocols of acceptance, concerning the services contracts previously concluded by O.C.P.I. Iasi with the administrators of the companies SC Gauss SRL, SC Grup Cinci SRL, SC Topo Euro Cad SRL, SC Agenția de Cadastre and Topografie SRL and PFA Lipșa Ștefan, which attested, in an unrealistic way, that the services contracted were performed in full, under conditions where they were not performed and were not filed with O.C.P.I. Iasi”.
Last days, the former head of the Office, Narciza Nedelcu, as well as other former or current employees of the OCPI were sent to trial in this case, the charges being the settlement of services to the aforementioned firms, although the work was not carried out.
The trial amounted to over 300,000.
Adventures in the Stone Age
According to FRH President Alexandru Dedu, Romania can host a major handball competition only in 2024, and the preparation of the female handball national for qualifying for the Olympic Games costs a fortune.
The President of the Romanian Handball Federation, Alexandru Dedu, said yesterday during a press meeting that it is a great pride that our country has three teams in the Champions League groups.
As for Romania’s national handball team, “the main goal is to qualify for the Rio Olympics, but for that they have to pass two caudine-fork stages, first the World Championship and second the pre-qualification tournament,” Dedu said.
We want to qualify for the Olympics.
These are fantastic demands from the technical staff led by Tomas Ryde.
The staff will be made up of seven or eight people.
He wants second coach, doctor, two massors, goalkeeper, physical trainer, head of delegation.
They asked us for the qualification some things, specifically physical training materials, of which we had never heard.
That’s all to get to the Olympics, and I’ll do everything I can to have them.
We are talking about a massive investment, there is a lot, a lot of money.
But this is the way to make performance.
Because we are currently in the Stone Age with preparation.
"The teams we're fighting with have these materials and have them for some time," Dedu said, who noted that they're trying to get the necessary amounts to purchase these products from MTS and COSR.
The President of the FRH also referred to the infrastructure in Romania and the possibility that our country will host a major handball competition.
There is no room in Bucharest.
It’s an infrastructure issue and it’s embarrassing to question a European Gymnastics Championship.
Let’s not forget that in other corners of the world the entire Olympic neighborhoods were built within two years.
Before 1992, in the present Olympic zone of Barcelona was a garbage pit, and now it has become a landmark of beauty.
The same happened in London, where the 2012 Olympics were also a success in terms of investment.
“In my vision, in 2024 we can host a major competition,” Dedu said.
He added that international handball bodies are willing to grant Romania the organization of a major competition.
For me, it is a priority to bring major handball competitions to Romania.
Mr. Gațu went civilised with a project, people agreed in principle, but it was very quickly clear that the hall would never be built.
I also had talks with the EHF, I told them that we want, that we are able to organize and they said that they agree and invite them to the first match in the new hall in Bucharest and then we discuss concrete.
"So we have all the openness, both at EHF and IHF, but we don't have the infrastructure," the FRH official explained.
The former great handballer avoided evaluating the chances of the female teams CSM Bucharest and HCM Baia Mare to reach the Final Four: "I asked all coaches to be reserved in the forecasts, that if they do not come true they turn against them."
Good way to the World Cup
Romanian rugby players start on September 23 against France
The captain of the national rugby team, Mihai Macovei, said on Tuesday at a press conference that all components of the lot of Romania are ready for the matches of the World Cup in England, where he hopes to two victories: "We are ready."
Both I and my colleagues are with the engines at maximum speed.
We tried to give the best score in the four matches.
Everyone will have high expectations because our goal is to win in two matches, against Canada and Italy.
All groups are tough and ours are the same.
Let’s take it lightly, first with France and then we’ll see.
But if we win against Canada, the match against Italy will be our final.
I cannot describe in words the joy of participating in the World Cup, it is the crown of so many years of work.
I want to not disappoint anyone in the rugby family and come home with good results.
“We want you to be proud that some players, a small family like rugby in Romania, proudly represent the tricolor,” Macovei said.
Romania’s national team manager, Lynn Howells, who had his first experience as a coach at the World Cup, hopes to make the Romanians proud of the rugby team: “It is a great honour for us to participate in this World Cup.”
I am sure the players are ready to participate in the tournament.
For me it is an extraordinary experience.
It is very important for me to make the Romanians proud of their national team in every match.
The President of the Romanian Rugby Federation, Haralambie Dumitraş, is confident that the Romanian players can confirm the progress made in recent years in rugby.
We have a very difficult group and we want to confirm the progress made in the national team.
I wish the athletes success and I am confident that we will be at the height of the event.
“These boys started playing in Romanian teams at the age of 18-19, so there is cohesion, there is a band of friends, who have set themselves to realize a dream,” Dumitraş said.
At the Rugby World Cup in England, Romania will evolve into Group D, having scheduled the following matches: with France on 23 September in London; with Ireland on 27 September in London; with Canada on 6 October in Leicester; with Italy on 11 October in Exeter.
The tournament begins on Friday at Twickenham Stadium in London with the match England – Fiji in Group A.

14 million lei given to St. Spiridon Hospital in Iaşi on budget rectification
What will be purchased with this huge amount of money?
St. Spiridon Hospital received from the Ministry of Health, following the budget correction, about 14 million lei.
The money that the medical unit has received to use by the end of the year will be invested in the modernization and arrangement of clinics, as well as in medical equipment and technology for which the hospital has already started the public procurement procedure.
Thus, the sanitary unit will be equipped with a new tomograph computer, with a new radiology apparatus, with six kits used for surgical interventions, six properly equipped ATI beds, an ophthalmological microscope and other devices necessary for the medical act.
On the other hand, 5 million lei of the money received by the hospital will be directed to the construction and arrangement of the "Great Ars".
From the money from the budget rectification, the UPU will receive 500,000 lei for the completion of the modernization works in the main section.
“In addition, in the coming days we will receive the work at the gateway that connects UPU with the cardiology, hepatology and gastroenterology clinics to ensure the transportation in decent conditions of the patient from UPU to the neighbouring clinics,” explained the manager of the medical unit.
The hospital will soon have the Tatarasi Dermatology Clinic in its courtyard, which it will organize on an outpatient basis, in the same form as it currently operates.
The clinic will operate in the area where allergy, hematology and endocrinology are located from the outpatient area and will have about 30 beds.
The jay, made of laughter by the RATP controllers and a pamphlet.
The Passion of a Tourist
A family of tourists from Cluj came to Iași to visit him, but the trip ended with a bitter promise.
After the experience, neither my wife nor I want to ever walk in your city again.
Unwillingly, they were hit by the misinformation in the leaflets, the insensitivity of the RAPT controllers and, bonus, a fine "as the law says".
The couple arrived in Iaşi a few days ago, stayed in a hotel in the Centre and asked for tourist leaflets.
They also received a pamphlet in which the RATP tracks were passed.
“Armed” with these maps, the spouses visited Iasi.
But two days ago, in Copou, they wanted to get to Palas Mall.
Since there was no ticket bar at the station near Copou Park, they relied on the information printed on the leaflet: that they could get a ticket via SMS.
No one told them that this service no longer exists.
Confident in the pamphlet, they boarded a bus and tried to send SMS following the instructions on the pamphlet.
Unfortunately for them, a team of RATP controllers made its appearance.
They said the service had been out for two years and that it was announced in the press that it was cancelled.
How do I know what was written in the local press, when I came in the evening before visiting the city?
I spoke to the controllers, I explained the situation to them, they said they don’t care, it’s not their business.
The attitude was very challenging.
They said that all I can do is pay one fine instead of two (me and my wife).
"I paid, I didn't want to ruin my day of visiting standing at the gendarmerie and giving statements there!" says Ovidiu.
In conclusion, the family was fined because of misinformation on the pamphlet and controllers who “applicated the law to the blood.”
It is not fair, and I made a referral to RATP Iasi to recover my money.
It’s not about money, I’m not exaggerated by many, but the idea is that I felt mistaken.
Unfortunate for the rapists.
They had an accident and remained in custody.
The trial of the seven rapists from Vaslui has been moved, yesterday, to the Iasi Court of Appeal.
Outgoing magistrates judged the first trial term in an unpublished hearing in which the seven young men accused of mocking an 18-year-old demanded to be released.
Before the beginning of the trial, one of the outgoing judges to whom the case had been handed over, Viorel Munteanu, made a request for abstinence, which was admitted by his court colleagues.
The magistrate worked until the summer of this year at the Vaslui Tribunal, where he was the chairman of the Penal Section, who on 9 April admitted a complaint made by four of the accused, ordering their placement in house arrest.
Currently, the case is being tried by a panel of magistrates Maricica Mititelu and Geta Sandu.
Earlier, Judge Dan Anton also abstained from the case on the grounds that his daughter was in a concubination relationship with one of the lawyers of the rapists.
The two judges decided that the Vaslui rapists should remain in pre-trial detention.
The youth will remain in jail for at least another 30 days, when the judges will rethink the possibility of their release.
The next trial will take place at the Iasi Court of Appeal on 6 October.
Before reaching the Iasi Court of Appeal, the dube with which the Vaslui rapists were transported was involved in an accident in the Păcurari neighborhood, the car entering Iasi on the belt.
The Iveco utility car in which the seven rapists were transported hit a Volkswagen car that had come out of Canta Street, and the driver tried to turn to the left.
Duba circulates from the end of the Păcăriari.
The car entered Iasi here because the employees of the Penitentiary Administration preferred the route from Vaslui to Iasi on the Grajduri, then on the belt road.
This shortened the road by a few miles.
Immediately after the impact, the escort of the detainees called another transport to pick up the detainees.
Soon, a car from the Iasi Maximum Security Penitentiary was sent to the scene of the accident, which took the seven detainees and transported them to the Court of Appeal.
As a result of the accident, none of the arrested were injured.
In order to transfer them to the other door, the guards surrounded the back of the cars, and the arresters went out in speed, two by two.
“The incident was not to the police because the drivers of the two vehicles agreed amicably on the damages to be paid,” said Chief Commissioner Mădălin Țăranu from the IPJ.
The large migration
Russia is not and will not be prepared for what will come.
What about Europe?
I say it from the beginning, clearly and clearly: the 7,000 refugees that Romania should and must naturalize represent, in itself, a small number, but huge in comparison with the Romanian state’s capacity to manage such a project.
For Romania, even the voluntary quota proposed by Bucharest, in the amount of about 1,500 souls, far exceeds our good intentions of solidarity with the European Union expressed in recent months.
Certainly, if those migrants will actually accept to settle in our locations, the chances of rapidly integrating them into Romanian society are extremely small.
I am sure they will be the first to lose their patience.
Parasitized by interlocutors and paralyzed by a venous political class, the Romanian state proves impotent in all fields.
The inability to integrate Gypsies is just a banal example.
Moreover, governments of any color have not been able to absorb European funds, to make modern roads, kindergartens or schools, to provide decent health care, to gather the misery from the streets, to create honourably paid jobs or to keep their own young generation at home.
Why would refugees settle in another country from which they are fleeing?
But what causes much wonder is especially the hypocrisy with which such a crisis is treated.
First, we are struck by the belligerent hypocrisy of the strong EU states, which show the utmost generosity when it comes to sharing the troubles with the smaller countries.
Then comes the frightening hypocrisy of Romanians who, although they have millions of relatives scattered all over the world, still do not accept the other – of another language, of another religion, of another blood.
Probably because of the fear that someone will not steal his national being.
Finally, there is also a hypocrisy of many migrants, who, although invoking only the horrors of war as the reason for leaving, do not accept any other destination of exodus than Germany or the Nordic countries.
However, not all refugees are Syrians and there is no war in Pakistan.
Also, the simplistic way in which the crisis is analyzed can only be ridiculed.
The causes must be eliminated, some argue, and, strictly on the book of political correctness, call for peace and investment for the countries of origin of migrants.
But there is peace in Romania and even some foreign capital enters the national economy from time to time – but that does not prevent tens of thousands of Romanians from leaving their country each year.
Why is he leaving?
In this crisis, the European Union has revealed itself to us as an anchored, divided and outdated construction.
I complained that Romania is not able to invent a country project, but here the EU also has no future plan.
Improvisations and threats do not help.
So what does the EU use if the only advantage that Romanians – the right to free movement – could be challenged by the waves of refugees crossing the borders like cheese?
At some point, the war in Syria will end.
Not the migration crisis.
In the coming decades, overpopulation, poverty, climate change, resource depletion, etc. will push millions of desperate migrants, from Asia and especially from Africa, toward a better life.
With such politicians, Romania is not and will never be prepared for what will come.
7,000 euros per year to rent the Pogor Club.
Practically imposed
The auction for concession is for a period of 10 years.
After seven years in which it remained closed, the club in the court of the Romanian Literature Museum is offered by the County Council for concession for a period of 10 years.
The construction has a useful area of 134 square meters, on two levels of rough.
CJ accepts as destinations given to the building only those of literary café, bookstore or other activities with a cultural profile.
The building was valued at 68,300 euros, the starting value of the auction being 6,830 euros annually, with a bid step of 25 euros.
The concessionaire will have to operate the building continuously and permanently and cover the entire cost of rehabilitation of the building, in accordance with the technical project to be drawn up.
“The Club Pogor building is in an advanced state of degradation due to the fact that during the period in which the public catering unit operated in these spaces and even after its evacuation, no current repair and maintenance works have been carried out as are currently required during the operation of a building,” it is stated in the documentation relating to the tender procedure.
Offers for the club’s concession are expected until September 18.
Two of my brothers swallowed sleeping pills.
They were taken to the hospital
Two children aged 9 and 11 respectively from Tomești, brothers, swallowed several Diazepam pills.
They found the pills in the house and took them out of curiosity.
Their mother was undergoing treatment, and the medications were not hidden.
The children were taken to the Santa Maria Hospital in Iasi.
They are in a stable condition, as doctors say.
Exclusive: A meeting that breaks your heart.
At the age of 20 she received a gift from her biological parents.
Lost in the hospital under unclear conditions, in the darkness of the 1990s, when she was only two months old, small, sick and helpless, and then adopted by a wealthy family from Italy, in the same years in which adoption was vaguely regulated, a young outgoing girl, now a blonde and beautiful girl, met yesterday in Iasi with her biological parents from a county village, after almost two decades in which no one knew anything about the others.
Crina will be 20 years old these days, and her adoptive parents from Palermo have thought to give their beloved daughter a stunning and courageous gift: a visit to Romania, Iasi, to know their unclear past.
The "Iasi newspaper", which witnessed the search efforts of the home family after a few extremely vague clues, witnessed these encounters that practically break your heart.
The reporting of reporters, the emotions of the moments, the statements of those involved, their reactions are quite moving and overwhelming.
The story of Crina began 20 years ago in the outgoing village of Ruginoasa, when she was only two months old.
Then, due to a health problem, the girl had to be admitted to the hospital in the city.
At home, there began to be disagreements between the parents, and the mother had to leave the home.
He decided to keep the girl and send me out of the house.
He stopped the girl, and since then I have not known anything.
“When I found out she was in the hospital, it was too late,” recalls Alina, the girl’s biological mother.
Crina was interned with her grandmother at the municipal hospital in Pascani, and also then her father, Costica Balcan, went to work in the city of Alexandria, Teleorman County.
Their lives were finally separated.
She has not been found in the hospital.
After being interned, Crina’s father went to work in another locality, and returned after six months.
Meanwhile, the girl was transferred to the Iasi hospital, and the father, when he returned, did not find her.
It was nine months since the girl was in the hospital.
“She thought she was abandoned,” one of the family’s grandchildren said.
Due to financial problems, the grandmother could not come with Crina to Iasi, and the girl remained in the care of doctors.
Since no one was interested in the fate of the child throughout this time, it was taken over by the Iasi General Directorate of Social Assistance and Child Protection, which then gave it to the care of the Placement Center in Bucium.
There were years when abandonment and adoption were more easily regulated than in Romania today.
At the Bucium Center she was found by the Italian Salvador and his wife, a couple from Palermo who wanted to have their child but failed.
They fell in love with the blonde Crina, and after a while she would move with them to Italy.
The little girl was almost two years old, as long as the adoption formalities lasted.
When we saw Crina, we felt like she was our girlfriend.
“It’s as if my wife gave him life,” says Salvadore, the adoptive father, smiling as he grabs the girl’s weak hand in his palm.
In the country, the parents of Crina, Alina and Costica, continued the search separately, each where they could.
The father asked the authorities in Ruginoasa, but he did not receive any answer where his child could be.
The police then told her that she may have died, but at Iasi the parents learned what really happened to their daughter.
When I searched for her here, they told me at the Tribunal that she had gone to Italy, to Palermo.
I had no conditions to look for it.
I prayed to God that he would be well.
I have been thinking about it all the years that have passed, but there were no possibilities for us to walk, to find it.
“It’s hard,” says Lina’s biological mother with tears in her eyes.
However, despite the years that passed, the parents of Ruginoasa were not forgotten.
In Italy, Salvadore and his wife explained to the girl where she came from and that her past connects her with Romania.
I was small when I found out.
I think I was five or six years old.
I reacted like a child, I was curious.
“I wanted to meet my parents in Romania,” Crina confesses delighted.
And her dream would become reality.
In March of this year, Chief Commissioner Romica Ichim, director of the Iasi Regional Centre for Drug Prevention, Evaluation and Counseling, was contacted by an Italian acquaintance who explained to him Salvador’s desire to find the biological family of Crina.
The search started with a name.
Following the request we had from our partners in Italy, we started the first steps.
We took only one name, the Coastal Balkans, and then the locality, Ruginoasa.
Soon I had an activity with the municipality there, and I could ask if there is by locality the name received.
Then they gave me some indications, only that the person found was not the one sought.
"It finally took about a month for us to find the girl's biological father," said Chief Commissioner Romica Ichim.
Overall, it took the authorities more than three months to find Costica and Alina, especially since each had a residence in a different locality.
We started somewhere in March, and in June-July we completed the identification of biological parents and discussions.
“Then we agreed that a first meeting would take place in September,” Romica Ichim added.
In the past weekend, Alina and Costica saw their daughter lost in the hallways of the Iasi hospital 20 years ago.
His father, excited, could hardly control his tears, and his hands kept trembling.
He barely exchanged a few words with others.
A week before the meeting, he could not even sleep.
He was excited, trembling.
"To see your child after so many years, is something," says a granddaughter, who also came with Costica from Ruginoasa.
Meeting with biological mother and brother
In talks with his daughter, who is going to study at a well-rated university in Italy, Costica Balcan told him, among other things, that if she wants to return to him, in the village, she should come quietly: she can give him some sheep, goats, so that she can find a boy from the village and build a household.
Her mother is also excited, she is crying, and she can hardly believe that something like this could happen to her.
I am very excited.
I did not think that something like this could happen.
I’ve seen such cases on television, I’ve been thinking about it all these years, I’ve hoped, but I didn’t think I could be like that.
They are very big emotions.
If he could forgive me.
I hope to visit in the future.
"I hope we can keep in touch," says Alina, the mother of Crina, with tears on her cheeks, while holding a towel tightly in her hand.
In it she still hides her tears of happiness, because soon she will see her girl after so much bitter time.
On the other hand, Crina, who will be just a few days old this month, 20 years old, tries to calm down like an emotional child.
She doesn’t know what to expect, but she has a vague idea about her biological parents.
He thinks they are young, but now before the meeting he tries to gather his thoughts, because he has a lot to say, but nothing to reproach.
My parents are two mothers and two fathers.
My parents were the ones who raised me.
It will be a wonderful meeting, a wonderful experience.
"I hope to have a nice memory with them, because now there are so many things to say," Crina confesses to us.
First Family Meeting in Iowa
In the Unirii Square, under the sky of the beginning of autumn, the Ruginoasa family once again unites their destiny with their daughter from Palermo.
Crina is now 20 years old, finishing high school, following the Italian school model, but can start a new chapter with Alina and Costica, her biological parents.
They are no longer separated by borders or countries, but only by a barrier: that of the language.
Over which, with the help of a translator, an Italian local owner in the centre of Iaș, passed easily.
Those who have managed to make this meeting possible say it is the first event of this kind, and that in the future, if the opportunity arises, they will do so again.
It is the first event of this kind organized, of such an emotional load, and I am pleased to be a success.
We, at the Center, have different activities, and most of the time we are associated as an institution that deals only with consumers, drug addicts.
But we are trying to give back something good to society.
"If I am asked for such an event again, I will do so with great love," says Romica Ichim, director of the Iasi Regional Center for Drug Prevention, Evaluation and Advisory.
Behind him, the Balcan family, with Crina in the middle, goes away telling stories.
They have a lot to say to each other.
Arms at the feet yesterday.
Everyone pulls their soul.
The camps in the outgoing branch of the PSD concluded a ceasefire with a gun at their feet.
After successive rounds of talks, held from Friday to Sunday, the first being the most tense, the PSD leaders agreed to temporarily suspend hostilities.
Pressured by the executive chairman of the party, Liviu Dragnea, to present a unified position, the outgoing Social Democrats will send him a full list of potential candidates for positions in the party.
Far from over, the party’s internal war seems to have only taken a break to allow fighters to pull their souls.
He did not give a ultimatum.
He issued a very simple and very current message in the current conditions: try to find a solution so as not to jeopardize the party.
On October 3 we have elections.
All functions will be made available to those who want to.
"Until then, we remain in the existing structure," said interim mayor Mihai Chirica.
The two days of talks over the weekend only led to the conclusion that nothing certain had been settled.
In the October elections, a fierce competition is expected for the post of president of the PSD county branch.
On the short list of possible candidates for the main position in the outgoing branch of the party are state secretary Maricel Popa, senator Florin Constantinescu, senator Sorin Lazăr, county counselor Vasile Câtea and interim president of the county council, Victorel Lupu.
To these may be added the mayor of the municipality of Schitu Duca, Mihai Mihalache.
A variant taken into consideration is the candidacy of PSD county councillor leader Cristian Stanciu, if Lupu will not register in the race, sources within the party stating that he is not interested in the position.
The only name that has not been mentioned by any of the participants in the negotiations in recent days is that of the former leader of the branch, mayor Gheorghe Nichita.
The list of candidates is open.
According to the statute, even on the day of the elections can be submitted candidates, and would not surprise anyone if it happened.
"The important thing is that we remain united, and we will remain after 3 October, when we will have a new Executive Bureau, a new County Permanent Bureau and all new management structures," Câtea said.
Until the internal elections, the leadership of the PSD’s county branch will be provided by Victorel Lupu, a close friend of Nichita and Stanciu.
Lupu, however, is on leave until September 29, with the preparation for the elections to be practically provided by the executive secretary of the branch, county counselor Mihail Popescu, who is in cold relations with the camp Nichita.
Contacted by phone, Cristian Stanciu assessed the talks in recent days as leading to "a partial consensus".
There is a wide readiness to maintain balance and unity in the party.
A partial consensus was reached, in the sense of supporting a united team to deal with the county.
"But on the other hand, there are several variants on the intentions related to the candidacy for the PSD Iasi presidency, the list remains open," Stanciu commented.
An outgoing judge rejected the case of Vaslui rapists on the grounds of concubinage
The seven youths in Vaslui County convicted for rape arrive today at Iasi Court of Appeal.
The Vaslui sentenced to sentences between five years and eight months and eight years and four months will present their arguments on their release today, after the main court, the Court of Vaslui, determined their imprisonment immediately after the sentence was issued.
The case was registered at the Court of Appeal at the end of last week, with Magistrate Dan Anton making a request for abstinence, admitted by his colleagues.
Anton argued that one of the defendants’ lawyers, Bogdan Luca, is the concubine of his daughter, Dana Anton.
Luca defends Silviu Ovidiu Burada, who received the heaviest punishment in this case.
How the judges motivated the verdict
At the end of last week, the Magistrate of the Vaslui Court, who convicted the seven young men, motivated the sentence.
In the motivation, the judge speaks of the challenging reaction of the accused, but also of those who supported them, stating that such attitudes create a strong feeling of indignation among the public opinion.
“The court finds that after the time of placing under the preventive measure of judicial control, a restrictive measure of liberty but not depriving of liberty, under the impact of the attitude of the defendants, their families and local supporters, was felt at the level of the local and national community a strong feeling of indignation over the fact that persons accused of serious acts are judged under a less restrictive measure,” it is stated in the justification of the Vaslui Court.
The magistrates also dismantled the main defense of the seven defendants who during the trial claimed that the girl they raped was not "the church door".
"The court stresses that the moral quality of the injured person is irrelevant, which the defendants wanted to highlight in their defences, since the physical and sexual freedom of a person cannot be violated under any pretext," the statement said.
Brexit and the future of Europe
Because of economic and demographic reasons, the prosperity they have over the past decades can no longer continue the same way in the years to come.
Until Saturday, probably few people in Romania knew who Jeremy Corbyn was.
Even today, after he became the new leader of the UK Labour Party, many wonder how much it can affect us to choose a politician who, after all, is not in a decision-making position.
Jeremy Corbyn is the most radical leftist Labour leader since the end of the war.
A declared Marxist, anti-monarchist (he once asked Tony Blair, then prime minister, to take the royal family out of Buckingham Palace), a fierce anti-American and a sympathizer of Vladimir Putin (he was also regularly invited to comment on political events by the TV channel "Russia Today"), and of the terrorist movements Hezbollah and Hamas, he wants Britain to give up nuclear weapons and leave NATO and the EU.
For Corbyn, who at the time regarded the killing of Osama bin Laden as a real tragedy, ISIS is close to preferring the United States.
Following the model of all populist demagogues, Corbyn has, of course, miraculous anti-austerity solutions.
Things like those that Tsipras said and promised in Greece until he got rid of the real world and economic legitimacy.
The new Labour leader’s economic program includes, among other things, massive nationalizations and money printing as a solution for financing development projects and covering very generous social benefits.
Sure, some might wonder why the solution with the printing of money is not unanimously adopted worldwide, we would then have a general worldwide prosperity!
Of course, we can tax the bankers to the blood, who have become some sort of serving enemies of the left, but as has been seen so many times in the past, not only in the former communist states or in Ecuador or Venezuela, but also in France, at the beginning of the mandates of Mitterand and Hollande.
The extra amounts are quickly swallowed by the generous, uncovered promises made by populist demagogues.
As Margaret Thatcher once said, “The problem with socialism is that at some point the money of others ends up.”
Few people give Jeremy Corbyn real chances of ever becoming prime minister.
In the early 1980s another radical leftist leader, Michael Foot, who was nevertheless not as extreme in beliefs as the party’s new leader, failed deplorably in the election.
And then there was still a relatively consistent and structured working class in the classical sense of the word in Britain.
Unions were much more influential than they are now.
In the new industrial landscape, where services dominate the workforce as a whole, and extensive automation has made the industry demanding a massive high-skilled workforce, Corbyn’s rhetoric has a limited appeal.
But even from opposition, he can influence important developments that can directly affect us.
In its latest issue, the Financial Times believes that Corbyn’s election increases the chances of Brexit, namely Britain’s exit from the EU.
The new Labour leader was a consistent opponent of the country’s membership in the Union.
In the eyes of the radical left, Brussels is the agent of international capitalism and a promoter of globalization that has imposed austerity on the poor.
When you combine this kind of ideas with those expressed by the radical right, with anti-immigration rhetoric, and look at the refugee crisis shaking the foundations of the EU, you come to an explosive mix.
And not just for Britain.
But if the British decide after the referendum, which was to be held by 2017, to leave the Union, the symbolic loss of capital for the entire European project and the deep gaps created within it by the Euro and now the refugee crisis, between North and South, between East and West, leave room for the most worrying scenarios.
Especially because for a whole number of member states, London was a counterpoint to the Franco-German axis (in which, anyway, Berlin becomes the dominant actor more and more).
It is true that the British business community, the City, are strong advocates of the country’s stay in the EU.
Today’s Europe is no longer the one of the past.
There are many resentments, which increase in intensity even in these weeks.
The problem is that Brussels, we even recently had a sample in Jean-Claude Juncker’s speech, is increasingly inclined to make major decisions over the head of the vast majority of member states in consultation with only a few European powers, mainly with Germany.
And this is happening as the electoral support for anti-system, anti-immigration formations that are at the same time and eurosceptic grows dramatically across the continent.
In other words, the negative-loaded emotional climate has reached higher odds than ever before.
This is what the Financial Times concludes when it evaluates the chances of Brexit.
The pro-EU option is based on a cold calculation starting from the national interest.
If voters make a brainstorming decision, then Britain will remain in the EU.
But Corbyn’s victory reminds us of the power of emotion in current politics.
However, Eastern Europe may be significantly affected by such major developments.
Especially if, as is expected, we witness a more pronounced integration of the euro area, which will push most of the countries in the region and to the periphery of the interest and the decision-making process in Europe.
Corbyn, Tsipras and Syriza in Greece, Podemos in Spain, even Bernie Sanders in the United States feed their populist rhetoric from the frustrations accumulated in Western societies.
For economic and demographic reasons, the prosperity that has been over the past decades, the generous social benefits, can no longer continue the same in the years to come.
Under the explosive pressure of the dual crisis, the Eurozone – immigration, both provoked by hasty decisions that have taken into account only the integrationist political ambitions, not the capacity and readiness of the peoples and governments of Europe to respond to such challenges, turbulence on the continent, internal tensions in the EU will increase in intensity and can greatly affect the situation of Romania.
And it’s hard to exclude anything from the perspective of possible scenarios.
The question is whether our top political leaders are able to cope with such complicated situations.
Constantin Brâncuşi, the peasant god.
Rockefeller: “How can I help you?”
“Take the workshop!”
The great sculptor had a great dream: to be someone, to become famous, to be heard about him all over the world.
Behind his reputation, however, lies something almost forgotten today, when we are delivered millions of success stories, recipes for success in life.
This thing also has a name.
It’s called hard.
What about Constantine Brâncuşi?
What else to say, actually?
His figure appeared on the banknotes.
And recently, a well-known bank in Romania hired an actor to play him in a commercial clip.
Brâncuşi produces and delivers money for 60 years since he is no longer among us.
In Romania, there are hundreds of streets and boulevards that carry his name.
By the way, even the author of this text lives on one of these streets.
And when he goes out with the baby, he hears the following instructions: "Let's go to the park, to Brâncuși."
The country is filled with its statues.
There are few Romanian personalities whose works are known to so many people, from children to the elderly.
The infiltration capacity of Brâncuși is enormous.
Even the communists were unable to remove it from the memory and culture of Romania.
His quotes are spreading the internet today, receiving hundreds of thousands of likes and shares.
And then, again, what else to say, to write about this man?
Looking from the pile of books and articles trying to reconstruct his fate, Brâncuşi’s life seems almost fantastic, totally unlikely.
You know, there are those people who tell you that if you haven’t been lucky enough to be born in a big city and a wealthy family, your chances of success in life are almost zero.
Brâncuşi’s life is the perfect counter-example.
And maybe there would be a key here.
This is where the following text should begin.
With a sentence, no matter how disgusting they are.
Forget the stupid success stories, which are delivered to you daily in newspapers and on television.
Look carefully at the figure of this man.
Do you want to know how to succeed in life, how, today, of him heard a whole world?
It is simple.
He worked his whole life to be someone.
That he did.
Constantin Brâncuși was born on February 19, 1876, in Hobița, a small village in the Peștiani commune, Gorj County, at the foot of the Carpathians.
He is the fifth child of Maria and Radu Nicolae Brâncuși.
Although he came from a wealthy peasant family, Brâncuși led a modest life, but one from which he would collect the landmarks that will guide his late artistic vision.
Recalling his childhood and the places where he grew up, the artist had to testify, in a meeting with Petre Țuțea, in Paris, in 1933: "At that time life was beautiful and harmonious."
For thousands of years, people have lived a patriarchal life.
Everything passed quietly from time to time.
Do you know why things have changed?
The civilization of the great city has reached us.
His childhood was far from idyllic.
One of the moments spent in these early years of life is extremely suggestive for the combination of purity and violence that characterized the future sculptor’s years spent in his hometown.
The moment is reproduced in the work "Brâncuşi. A biography", written by Alexandru Buican.
In 1879, Constantin Brâncuşi was 3 years old.
In the autumn of that year, when it was made "at the boiler", following those who tasting the liquid to see if the process is going well, Brâncuși catches a moment of general inattention.
He fills his palms with water and drinks.
He falls asleep almost instantly.
The first people notice only after a few minutes.
The mother paniced, and then became hysterical, thinking that her son had died.
By the evening, when his father, Radu, returns from the vineyard accompanied by laurels, he sees from a distance the signs of desperation of those who await him with the soul at his mouth.
The party immediately turns into jale.
The father is already thinking about burial.
Nevertheless, someone finds it good to call Baba Brândușa, the Brâncuș’s maid and maid.
She checks the baby’s breath, then puts under his nose a horse’s bowl, gathered from around.
The child sneezes strongly.
The world applauds.
While the boy is left to sleep his drunkenness further, of joy, the party with laurels continues with even more force.
The next day, father and son meet in the lawn.
Radu Brâncuşi asks Constantine to gather some nuts and bring them to him.
The father puts his child with his head down and, with the arrows brought by the boy, beats him to remember.
And while he feels the thickness of the strikes, the little Brâncuşi has the revelation that the world can also be seen from a different perspective and that things around him can appear overturned.
Especially the position of the sun, different from the well-known one, makes him wonder, as he would recognize at old age, if not the star himself participates in his disorder.
Would the sun have been as upset as his father by what had happened to him?
At the moment the city is not functioning.
A member of parliament calls on politicians to remember those who voted for them.
Independent MP Viorel Blăjuț has called on PSD and the PNL to end internal struggles and reorient their agenda towards the electorate.
What we see now on our political stage is a great division and that’s all.
I have not seen any of the USL projects from 2012 to continue.
Neither the highway nor the Regional Emergency Hospital, just see how politicians dispute their possible locations according to real estate interests.
Let’s leave politics a little, get together and talk.
At the moment, the city is not functioning.
“If you’re busy with domestic war, you don’t have time for those who chose you,” Blăjuţ said.
He appreciated that the current political class has disappointed the outgoing electorate, the consequence being a very small presence at the upcoming local elections, around the figure of 30%, representing virtually the faithful electorate of the parties.
The MP also believes that voters will also focus on traditional parties, expressing their reservation to new political initiatives, such as the party "For Iasi" that will be launched today.
Local parties have very small chances and will only break from the right-wing electorate, not from the PSD.
Such parties rely on civically active people, who are usually right-wing.
“The right is further fragmenting, which is not good for anyone, not even for the PSD,” Blăjuț said.
He said he was not interested in a candidacy in the upcoming local elections, denying rumors about his intention to run for the mayor.
I have said that I do not want to run for any office.
I would like to continue as a member for the next term.
I tried to appeal to unity for Iasi and in the talks in the halls, with the other parliamentarians, and I was accused of wanting to make a picture of myself.
I don’t want to, but we can’t continue that way.
“If people voted for us, it doesn’t mean they are stupid to vote for us if they don’t see anything,” Blăjuţ said, who said that the main reason why voters are no longer interested in politics is the hypocrisy of the elected.
One of his colleagues said he didn’t have enough money and had to take the bus.
Let us not be hypocritical.
It is not little money.
Sometimes I feel ashamed to take my money out of the box.
At the end of my term, I will report everything I have spent, except the salaries of the cabinet employees and its maintenance.
It happened to raise in a month and 30,000 lei, with all the settlements for transport, accommodation and the rest.
"To say to a member of parliament that his money is not enough is pure hypocrisy," Blăjuţ concluded.
