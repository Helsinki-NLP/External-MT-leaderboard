Not only does this support the popular theory that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, but it also provides information that you wouldn't normally get from fossil studies, such as color and the spatial arrangement of feathers.
Scientists say the animal's plumage was brown on top and pale or red-yellow on the reverse.
This discovery provides a new window on the evolution of bird feathers.
Because the dinosaur feather lacks the well-developed stem of the  rachis, but has the other feather features  ears and beard, the researchers concluded that the rachis was likely a late evolutionary change compared to the other features.
Judging from the structure of the feather, it was used to maintain temperature or attract attention, rather than fly. Researchers assumed that even though it was a juvenile dinosaur's tail, the specimen did not show the plumage of a juvenile, but rather adult plumage.

Price and Hyun are scheduled to appear before the Westminster Magistrates' Court on February 16.
Nicholas Alden, 25, and Zachary Kadebek, 21, were killed in a car crash, with Kadebek at the wheel.
Christopher Schneider would need plastic surgery on his face, and Edgar Vegelo was injured in his jaw and arm.
When Wooke pointed the gun at the fifth man's head, it didn't work, and Schneider now suffers from constant pain and is blind in one eye, missing part of his skull, and his face is now partly titanium.
Schneider was testifying from his home country via video link while at a US Navy base.
In addition to the competition on Wednesday, Karpaneda took part in the championship in two more individual races.
She first took part in the slalom, where she retired from the distance in the first round. 36 of the 116 participants of the competition showed the same result.
In the giant slalom, she finished tenth among women in a sitting position, with a total time of 4:41.30 minutes, 2:11.60 minutes behind first place, which was taken by Austrian Claudia Löss, and 1:09.02 minutes behind ninth place, which was taken by Jongi Dani from Hungary.
Four skiers from the group of athletes with disabilities did not reach the finish line, and 45 out of a total of 117 skiers could not qualify for participation in the giant slalom.
The stolen laptop and mobile phone were returned to the owner by the Madhya Pradesh Police.

Even though there were three people in the car when it crashed into the house, none of them were hurt.
However, the driver suffered severe head injuries.
While emergency services were rescuing the driver of the red Audi TT, traffic on the road where the accident occurred was temporarily blocked.
He was first admitted to James Padgett Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was eventually transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adeajo has since been held in the Edinburgh Sheriff's Court on charges of murdering her son.
She is awaiting indictment and trial while in custody, but given that her photographs have been widely published, any eyewitness testimony could be called into question.
This is common practice elsewhere in the UK, however in Scotland the law works differently  the courts consider that the publication of the photographs could potentially be harmful.
"Journalists seem to be taking a dangerous path when they post photos etc. of suspects", says Professor Pamela Ferguson.
The Central Chancery of the High Court, authorized to bring to criminal responsibility, informed the journalists that at least until the indictment is presented, no further comments will be possible.
According to the information received, the document mentions a border dispute that Palestine wants to resolve in order to preserve the borders that existed before the 1967 Middle East war.
According to the information received, among other topics covered by the document are the issues of the future status of Jerusalem, sacred to both peoples, as well as the problem of the Jordan River Valley.
Israel demands that after the agreement is signed, the military presence in the valley is maintained for ten years, while the Palestinians agree only for five years.
The rangers had to keep a close eye on the shooters who were part of the supplemental animal control program, because the program was monitored and evaluated for its effectiveness.
The National Parks and Wildlife Service, in conjunction with the Sports Shooters Association of Australia, Inc. campaign, has recruited qualified volunteers to participate in the shooting program, which is implemented under the auspices of the Sports Shooters Association.
Mick Flynn, the acting director of the National Parks and Wildlife Service's conservation and park heritage program, said the four shooters selected for the first shoot were given comprehensive safety training and training.
Martelli yesterday swore in a new nine-member Provisional Electoral Council.
This is the fifth interim election in Martelly in four years.
A presidential commission last month recommended the early dissolution of the Interim Electoral Council as one of many measures to prepare the country for new elections.
To the large-scale anti-regime protests that began in October, Martelli responded with a commission.
The reason for the protests, which were sometimes violent and violent, was the lack of elections, some of which had not been held since 2011.
There were about 60 cases of overheating of defective earbuds, which led to six fires, and four people got minor burns.
According to a statement by the Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (MEIT), there was information on 27 accidents that occurred due to the use of devices.
Last week, Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry announced that it had received reports from Apple of 34 new cases of overheating, which it labelled "not serious".
In response, the ministry called the transfer of the company's report to a later date "deserving of deep regret".
The quake struck the Mariana Islands at 7:19 a.m. local time (Friday's 21:19 GMT).
Officials from the Northern Mariana Islands Emergency Management Office said there were no reports of destruction or accidents in the country.
Furthermore, according to the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center, there were no signs of a tsunami.
A former Filipino policeman has seized a bus in the Philippine capital Manila and held tourists from Hong Kong hostage.
Rolando Mendoza was firing at tourists with his M16.
Several hostages were rescued, and at least six have been confirmed killed.
The six hostages, including the elderly and children, as well as the photographers from the Philippines, were released early.
The elderly lady needed a bathroom, so the photographers were left in the barracks instead of her, and Mendoza was shot.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and became a doctor.
He trained as a midwife and began working at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
While Liggins worked at the hospital, he began to study the problem of premature births in his spare time.
According to his research, the introduction of the hormone accelerated the maturation of the embryo's lungs.
According to the Xinhua news agency, government investigators found two so-called "black boxes" of flight data recorders on Wednesday.
Luna's memory was also honored by her fellow wrestlers.
"Luna was the first Queen of the Extreme. My first manager. She died in the night two months later. It's quite original, like her. Luna was a strong woman", Tony Dreamer said.
Dustin Goldstein Runnels said, "Luna was still a freak, no less than I was... maybe even more... I love her and I'll miss her... I want to believe she's in a better place now".
The number of people who oppose Australia becoming a republic has increased by 8 percent since 2008 (according to a poll of 1,400 people conducted before the 2010 federal election).
During the 2010 federal election campaign, Acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard stated that she believed that at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign, Australia should become a republic.
Thirty-four percent of those polled said they wanted Queen Elizabeth II to be the last Australian monarch.
The most radical views were expressed by 29 percent of those polled, who thought Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, and another 31 percent, who, on the contrary, believed it should never happen.
The Olympic gold medallist was expected to swim the 100 and 200 metres freestyle and take part in three relay races during the Commonwealth Games, but his fitness is questionable: he has complained quite a lot about his health.
He was unable to take pain relievers because they are prohibited at the Games.
On January 25th, Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, found the largest prime number known to date.
This discovery was confirmed by several people using different hardware and software before the beginning of February, and it was announced on Tuesday.
It is speculated that comets may have brought to Earth not only organic matter that could form proteins and serve as a source of life, but also water.
Given the impact of cometary collisions in the distant past, scientists hope to understand how planets, especially Earth, form.
Earlier this year, 53-year-old Cuomo was elected governor and signed a bill legalizing same-sex marriage last month.
He christened these rumours "political gibberish and stupidity".
He is supposed to run for president in 2016.
The Federal Aviation Administration says that with the NextGen system, planes will be able to fly shorter routes, which will help save millions of gallons of fuel each year and reduce carbon emissions.
Unlike older ground-based radar systems, it uses satellite technology that allows aviation dispatchers to determine the location of aircraft with greater accuracy and give pilots more accurate information.
Traffic volume is not increased, and ground trains will not stop at Wembley, besides, there is no car parking at ground level, as well as a parking-stop.
The probability of having to play behind closed doors without fans of the team increased, as it may well be that there is not enough transportation.
The formation of a new species of bird on the Ecuadorian Galápagos Islands is documented in a study published Thursday in the journal Science.
According to researchers at Princeton University (USA) and Uppsala University (Sweden), the evolution of a new species took just two generations, although it was previously thought that this process took much longer, and was made possible by the crossing of the endemic ground yurk (Geospiza fortesza) with the non-cactified ground yurk (Geospiza contrisiros).
Gold can be molded into many shapes, and it can be rolled into thin sheets.
You can pull it out into a very thin wire, which can then be easily twisted and braided, and you can also tear it apart and then you can roll it into sheets.
It could be made very thin and attached to another metal, and it could be so thin that it was occasionally used to decorate illustrated books, so-called illuminated manuscripts.
It's called the pH level of a particular chemical, and you can make your own acid-base indicator like this with red cabbage juice.
The color of the cabbage juice changes depending on the acidity or alkalinity of the substance.
The pH level in a test chemical is determined by the number of hydrogen ions (L H in pH).
A hydrogen ion is a proton that has lost its electron (as we know, a hydrogen atom is composed of one proton and one electron).
Mix these two dry powders in a circle until they merge into one, then with wet hands, make a ball.
The moisture on your hands reacts with the outer layers, creating a strange sensation, forming a shell.
Almost every house in Harappa and Mahendjo-Daro had a flushing toilet connected to a complex sewer system.
In houses of the Minoan period in Greek cities such as Crete and Santorini, the remains of sewer systems have been found.
The use of unitas was also found in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China, and in the Roman Empire, unitas were sometimes used in public baths, where men and women were kept together.
You're using a satellite to make a call to someone who's thousands of miles away.
In space, a satellite receives a call, and then reflects it back almost instantly.
They use a rocket to launch a satellite, but scientists have to use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere refracts the light and distorts the image.
To send a telescope or a satellite into space, you need a huge rocket more than 100 feet high.
The wheel has changed the world in so many ways -- lighter, faster travel -- but the biggest thing the wheel has done for us is to change the world.
He's the reason we have trains, cars, and all sorts of other forms of transportation.
Below are the medium-sized cats, and their prey is also medium-sized - they hunt both rabbits and antelopes and deer.
In addition to all, many small cats (including free-ranging domestic pets) hunt and eat numerous smaller prey  insects, rodents, lizards and birds.
But the secret of their success is that each cat has a niche, meaning that it has a function that is unique to it, and therefore it doesn't have to compete with other cats.
Lions are among the most sociable of cats, living in large flocks known as pride.
A pride may include up to three adult males who are related, as well as up to thirty females and young.
In most cases, the females are closely related, forming a large family of sisters and daughters.
The behavior of lion parrots and wolf or dog packs are similar in many ways, the latter can be very similar to lions (but not other large cats) in that they pose a mortal danger to prey.
The tiger can climb (but not so well), jump long distances, swim, and pull with five times the strength of a human as a well-trained athlete.
The tiger is a member of the same group as lions, leopards, and jaguars, and no other cats except these four can roar.
The tiger's roar is more like a phrase consisting of sharp and loud words than the high-pitched roar of a lion.
The acelots are used as food by small animals, and whenever possible, they hunt monkeys, rodents, snakes, and birds, all of which are much smaller than the acelots.
Scientists believe that the ocelot tracks and finds prey by sniffing the tracks on the ground.
Its night vision gives it excellent vision in the dark, it can navigate very confidently, and it's a hunter-gatherer, blending into its natural environment and emerging from its hideout to prey.
When a small group of organisms (a small population) breaks away from the main population from which they came (say, when moving across a river or a mountain range, or when such organisms migrate to a new island, so it is quite difficult for them to return), they often end up in an environment that is significantly different from the place from which they came.
And in this new environment, there are different resources and different competitors, so the new population will need different traits or different adaptations than they had before to be competitive.
The original inhabitants of the area have not changed at all, and they still need to adapt.
Over time, as new populations begin to adapt to new environments, the animals become less and less like the main populations from which they separated.
Thousands or even millions of years will pass, and sooner or later, the two populations will look so different that no one will even consider them to be the same species.
We call this process speciation, which is actually the process of creating new species, and speciation is the inevitable result of this, and a very important step in evolution.
Plants produce the oxygen that we breathe, and they use up the carbon dioxide that we exhale.
Plants digest food from sunlight through photosynthesis, but they also provide shade.
We make homes from plants and clothing from plants, and we eat most of the plants, and the animals couldn't survive without the plants.
At the time, they were super-human, so they feared nothing and no one but other dinosaurs.
It had over 70 razor-sharp teeth on its long jaws and another extra row at the top of its mouth, meaning that its prey could not survive.
Although it is not known for certain, it is possible that it had a bi-lingual tongue, and that its diet consisted of crappie fish, turtles, and other animals, it is likely that it also ate members of its own species.
Besides, he would go for anything in the water, even a giant like the Tyrannosaurus Rex.
While most of their food would not surprise us, some of their dishes were unusual, to say the least, including wild peacocks, snails, and one of the rodents known as the walnut sunflower.
Another difference was that while the poor and women ate sitting on chairs, the rich had banquets where they ate and rested at the same time.
Ancient Roman cuisine could not incorporate the foods that would later be brought to Europe from the Americas or Asia.
They didn't have, specifically, potatoes or tomatoes or corn or cocoa, and no ancient Roman had ever had a chance to taste a turkey.
To each of their gods, the Babylonians built a main temple, which was considered their home.
Worshippers offered sacrifices to their gods, and priests attempted to satisfy their needs by holding various festivals and ceremonies in their honor.
Each temple had its own open courtyard and sanctuary, which could only be visited by priests.
In some cases, the temples were built with towers that resembled pyramids, and these towers were known as ziggurats.
The top of the tower was a special beacon dedicated to the god.
In the warm Middle Eastern climate, the house was not of much importance.
For the most part, Jewish family life was outside, in the open air.
Women cooked outside, shops were just open shelves facing the street, houses were built of stone.
Canaan lacked large forests, so the wood was highly valued.
Greenland was not densely populated, and if you believe the Norse sagas, Erik Rudd was expelled from Iceland for murder, and he sailed west and came across Greenland, which he called "the Green Land".
But regardless of his discovery, Eskimo tribes were already living there at the time.
There were many differences between the peoples, kings, customs and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland, despite the fact that each of these countries was "Scandinavian".
If you've seen the movie Treasures of the Nation, you might think that the back of the Declaration of Independence was a treasure map.
But it's not, and even if it does have something written on the back of it, it's not a treasure map.
The Declaration of Independence, on the reverse side, read: "Original version of the Declaration of Independence dated July 4, 1776". The inverted version is found at the bottom of the document.
No one knows for sure who wrote it, but what is known is that the large parchment document (29 3/4 inches by 24 1/2 inches) was folded early in its existence for preservation.
So it's possible that this note was added there as a memento.
The Normandy landings and subsequent battles liberated the north of France, but the south was still occupied.
It was under the control of the Yves Saint Laurent, who were the French who made peace with the Germans in 1940 and cooperated with the invaders instead of fighting them.
On 15 August 1940, Operation Dragoon began, and the Allies landed in southern France.
The Americans and the Free French forces liberated the southern French territories in just two weeks, then moved towards Germany.
A civilization is a single culture of a fairly large group of people working together and living in a society.
The term civilisation comes from the Latin civilis, i.e., "civil", which is similar in meaning to the Latin civis, i.e., "citizen", and civitas, i.e., "city" or "city-state", which in turn tells us something about the size of a society.
City-states are the precursors of a nation, and civilized culture means the transmission of knowledge across generations, the even distribution and the continuing cultural footprint.
Many small cultures are not considered civilizations in the full sense of the word, as they disappear without leaving behind any significant historical evidence.
During the American Revolutionary War, thirteen states initially established a weak central government under the terms of the Treaty of the Thirteen States, which included only Congress.
Congress had no power to impose taxes, and since there was no national executive or judicial authority, it relied on the government's often non-interactive agencies to enforce all laws.
Furthermore, it lacked the authority to override state-imposed tax laws and tariffs.
The Treaty of Confederation required the unanimous consent of all the states to make any amendment, and the states took the central government so seriously that their representatives were often absent.
The Italian national football team, like the German national team, is the second-strongest national team in the world.
Football, basketball, volleyball, fencing, rugby, water polo, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and Formula 1 racing are some of the popular sports here.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern regions, with Italians also taking part in international games and Olympic competitions.
Japan is made up of nearly 7,000 islands, the largest of which is the Hanshū Island. This makes Japan the seventh largest island in the world.
Japan is often referred to as an "archipelago" from a geographical point of view, as it is a cluster or group of islands.
Taiwan's history dates back to the 15th century, when its name was recorded by European sailors passing by as Pharmos , which meant beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan and initiated a reform of the primitive practices of farming.
The Qing dynasty (1644-1912) seized the western and northern Taiwanese territories in 1683 and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
After its defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government concluded the Treaty of Shimonoseki in 1895, which ceded sovereignty over the island to Japan, and the latter held it until 1945.
Machu Picchu is made up of three main sites: the Incihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room with Three Windows.
To give you a better idea of how most of the buildings on the edges of the complex originally looked, the last few buildings have been rebuilt.
By 1976, 30% of Machu Picchu had been restored, and restoration work continues to this day.
The most popular still image format in the world is the 35 mm format. By the time of the analog era, this film format was dominant.
This is the type of film that is being made today, but more importantly, the width-to-height ratio is now being used in the formats of digital camera matrices.
This may be a little confusing, but the 35mm format is actually 36mm wide and 24mm high.
Accordingly, it is considered that the aspect ratio for this format (after dividing by twelve to obtain a simpler ratio of integers) is  3:2.
Many common formats have the same or similar aspect ratios (for example, the APS family of formats).
The rule of thirds, which is often attacked and ridiculed, is a simple set of rules that provide dynamism while maintaining a degree of order in the image.
If one believes him, the best place for the placement of the main subject is at the intersection of the lines that divide the photograph into vertical and horizontal planes on the third (see example).
This period of European history brought the Catholic Church into the spotlight as it became rich and powerful.
Despite all the linguistic and cultural differences that might have occurred, Christianity united Europe for over a thousand years.
Everyone from the king to the common man was under her all-pervading power.
The essence of one of the central tenets of Christianity is that wealth should be used to alleviate misery and to alleviate suffering, and that is what the church's money is for.
For over a thousand years, the central authority of the church was in Rome, and this concentration of power and money has led many to question whether this doctrine is being upheld.
Britain initiated a naval blockade of Germany shortly after the start of hostilities.
The embargo on the supply of vital military and civilian goods, although in violation of generally accepted international law, has been codified in several international agreements over the past two centuries, but has proven to be an effective strategy.
Britain mined international waters to prevent certain ships from entering, and thus threatened neutral waters.
As there was no significant reaction to this tactic, Germany assumed that it would not be used for unlimited submarine warfare.
Most citizens and countries in the 1920s were dominated by pacifist and isolationist sentiments.
States and peoples intended to avoid such a situation in the future, having already witnessed the horrors and atrocities of World War I.
Tesla moved to the United States in 1884, after being employed by the Edison Company in New York.
Four cents, a collection of poems, and a letter of recommendation to Thomas Edison written by Charles Bachalor (his manager from his previous job) were in his pocket when he arrived in the US.
Ancient China had unique ways of denoting the different eras, and each era in Chinese history had its own distinct dynasty or ruling family.
Dynastic periods were further divided into periods of disunited provinces and periods of instability, the most famous of which was the Three Kingdoms period, which lasted 60 years between the Han and the Jin dynasties.
During these periods, many courtiers who competed for the throne engaged in brutal warfare.
One of the bloodiest periods in ancient Chinese history was the Three Kingdoms period, when thousands of people died fighting for the highest seat in the Great Palace of Xi'an.
The French Revolution had many social and political consequences, including the transition from absolutism to a republican system of government, the introduction of the metric system, the emergence of nationalism, and the belief that the country belonged not to a single ruler but to the people as a whole.
Furthermore, the Revolution made all positions open to male candidates, resulting in the most successful and ambitious ones to the top.
In the army, the same thing happened, because if earlier the military ranks were assigned based on the class, now they are based on skills and abilities.
In addition, many other oppressed workers from other countries were inspired by the French Revolution to start their own revolutions.
Mohammed was deeply interested in matters beyond the worldly life, and he often visited the cave on Mount Noor (translated as Light), known as Hira, to meditate and reflect.
The very cave, which has stood the test of time, provides a very vivid insight into Mohammed's spiritual background.
The cave is completely isolated from the rest of the world  it is located on top of one of the mountains north of Mecca.
In fact, it's very difficult to find, even if anyone knows about it, because inside a cave, you're completely isolated.
There's nothing to see but a clear beautiful sky above and many surrounding mountains, and very little of this world can be seen or heard from inside the cave.
The Pyramid of Cheops is the only one of the Seven Wonders of the World that has survived to the present day.
The Great Pyramid is one of many pyramids that were built to commemorate the pharaoh-deceiver.
The Giza Plateau, also known as the Necropolis of Giza, in the Valley of Death in Egypt, contains several pyramids (the largest being the Great Pyramid), a number of smaller tombs, several temples, and a large Sphinx.
The construction of the Great Pyramid was dedicated to the memory of the Pharaoh Cheops, and many smaller pyramids, temples and tombs were dedicated to the pharaoh's wives and family members.
The symbol for the upward movement of the bow looks like V, and the downward  is like a bracket or square without a lower edge.
 Upward bow movement  means you start the movement from the end of the bow and go upwards, and  downward bow movement  means you start from the peg (this is where your hand holds the bow) and go downwards.
Moving the bow upwards generally produces a softer sound, and downwards a stronger and more confident one.
You can put your marks on the pencils, but remember that the printed symbols are there for a specific musical reason, so they usually need to be stored.
On 6 October 1789, King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (four-year-old Louis-Charles and 11-year-old Marie-Thérèse), and Madame Elisabeth, the king's sister, were forced to return from Versailles to Paris due to the crowd of women from the market.
The royal family were driven to Paris in a carriage, surrounded by a mob whistling, wailing, and shouting threats against the king and queen.
The King and Queen had to open the windows of the carriage to the crowd of people.
At one point, a man in the crowd waved to the Queen, who was already scared to death, the head of the guard slain at Versailles.
The military expenses incurred by the US imperialists in connection with the conquest of the Philippines had to be paid by the Filipinos themselves.
To pay a large part of the cost and interest on the bonds that were placed through the banking houses of Wall Street on behalf of the Philippine government, they had to pay taxes to the colonial regime of the United States.
Undoubtedly, the main achievement of the US imperialists would be the surplus brought about by the prolonged exploitation of the Filipino people.
To understand who the Templars were, you need to understand the background of the Order.
The era in which these events occurred is traditionally called the Classical Middle Ages, a period of European history covering the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000-1300 BC).
First was the Early Middle Ages, followed by the  Classical Middle Ages, and then the  Late Middle Ages. The last is generally considered to have ended around 1500.
The term "technological determinism" is understood to encompass a range of practical ideas, from the push to advance certain technologies or technical necessity to the strict understanding that human destiny is determined by the logic on which scientific laws are based and their embodiment in the technology realm.
Two common ideas are common to most explanations of technological determinism: the development of technology itself largely goes beyond cultural or political influence, and technology, in turn, is made by its own (rather than socially determined) influence on society.
In particular, there's a belief that using cars will stimulate road development.
However, if the number of cars is low, a nationwide network of highways makes no economic sense; therefore, new production methods are being developed to reduce the cost of owning a car.
The increased number of car owners has led to an increase in the number of road accidents, which in turn has led to the development of new techniques in the health care field that allow for the treatment of various injuries.
A large element of cultural determinism, influenced by the works of writers such as Goethe, Fichtel, and Schlegel, was typical of Romanticism.
If we talk about the Romantic era, people were very much influenced by the geography of their presence, and as time went on, the traditions and the culture that came with it, they were better than the random laws that were put in place, because they were in harmony with the place and the position that the society was in.
While Paris is considered the modern fashion capital, Constantinople was known as the fashion capital of Europe during feudal times.
Around 400 CE, the city gained fame as an epicenter of luxury and retained this status until almost 1100 CE.
During the 12th century, its status as the capital of luxury was due mainly to the fact that the Crusaders returned with gifts, which included spices and silk, and were valued much higher than those offered in Byzantine markets.
It was then that Constantinople ceded the title of fashion capital to Paris.
The Gothic style flourished between the 10th and 11th centuries, and again in the 14th century.
The first strong influence on the style of clothing was the Eastern Byzantine culture.
However, Western styles may be late by 25 to 30 years because of the slowness of the communication channels.
Western Europe began to develop its own distinctive style in the late Middle Ages, and the Crusaders' use of buttons to fasten clothing was one of the most significant developments of the period.
Natural farming produces enough food to satisfy the needs of the farmer and his family.
Natural farming is a simple and generally organic system based on the use of a region's own organically preserved seeds in combination with seeding or other non-complex methods to maximize yields.
Many farmers have historically used non-organic farming, and many Third World countries still use it.
Subcultures bring together like-minded people who feel excluded by social norms and allow them to develop a sense of self.
Age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender of members can be distinctive features of subcultures.
The definition of a particular subculture may be based on a variety of factors  linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical or a combination of these.
Members of the same subculture often identify their membership through distinctive and symbolic styles of dress, mannerisms, and jargon.
The most frequently cited example of what socialization is and how important it is is children who were unlucky enough to grow up in a climate of disregard, neglect, abuse, humiliation and abuse and who were not socialized by adults as children.
Some children were kept in captivity for long periods of time (usually by their own parents); in some cases, the lack of parental care was due to the parents' reluctance to notice the child's serious physical or intellectual disabilities.
Before they were abandoned or escaped, the children who went wild were more likely to have suffered severe abuse or trauma.
Others were said to have been raised by animals; some were even rumored to have been left alone in the wild.
If a child is raised entirely by animals, their behavior in almost every way (including physical limitations) reflects the behavior of the animal-nurse: for example, such a child may be afraid of people or be indifferent to them.
So while the whole purpose of design-learning is to make learning fun and easy, scaffolding goes even further.
Scaffolding is not a method of learning, but rather a tool that helps people to gain new learning experiences, whether it's using a new software or starting a new project.
Assistants can be both real and virtual, for example, a teacher and a little plug-in in Microsoft Office.
The software includes virtual assistants to ask questions, give hints, and explain procedures that the student or listener might not be able to do on their own.
There are many reasons why children end up in foster care, from abuse, neglect, even coercion.
You can't have children growing up in an environment where they're not cared for, raised, and educated, and yet this happens.
We think that the foster care system is a safe haven for these kids.
The assumption that our foster care system supports is that foster children will have good health care, safe homes, caring and caring guardians, and a stable education.
It is the belief that the foster family is supposed to provide for the needs of the child that were not met in the home from which the child was taken.
The Internet is not just a means of mass communication, but also of interpersonal communication.
The peculiar nature of the Internet is that it has additional ways to use it and to meet the needs of the audience.
For example, it is suggested that such concepts as education and socialization are important motives for using the Internet (James et al., 1995).
The concepts of "personal engagement" and "personal relationship" were also defined by Aimee and McCord (1998) as new aspects of motivation when studying audience response to Internet sites.
Video recording has made important discoveries in the interpretation of microexpressions  denoting facial muscle movements lasting only a few milliseconds.
It is claimed, among other things, that correct interpretation of micro-expressions can help determine whether a person is lying or telling the truth.
In his "The President's Speech", Oliver Sacks noted how people with brain damage, unable to understand speech, could still accurately appreciate honesty.
He even suggests that animals -- like domestic dogs -- might also be able to correctly interpret human behavior.
20th-century research suggests that there are two types of genetic variability, namely, overt and latent variation.
Mutations can cause new variations to appear, and selection can remove them from the population.
With each successive generation, segregation and recombination mix variations within these two pools.
The abundant plant resources in the savannah do not meet the amino acid needs of the primate, which has a digestive system similar to that of humans.
Moreover, when they fail, the consequences are serious, including malnutrition, stunted growth, and eventual death.
The most abundant plant resource would be proteins, which we find in legumes and leaves, but if they're not cooked properly, they're hard to digest for primates like us.
In contrast, animal foods (ants, termites, eggs) provide the body with a large amount of protein, rich in all the necessary amino acids and at the same time easily digested.
So it shouldn't be surprising that our ancestors were solving this "protein problem" in much the same way that the chimpanzees in the savanna are doing today.
Interrupting sleep is the deliberate awakening of a sleeping person during normal sleep and falling back asleep after a short time (10 to 60 minutes).
One way to do this is with a relatively quiet alarm clock that wakes you up, but not quite.
If you find yourself rewinding the clock in your sleep, try to put it at the other end of the room, so you'll have to get out of bed to turn it off.
According to other biorhythm-based alternatives, drinking plenty of fluids (primarily water or tea, a known urinary stimulant) before going to bed can make a person wake up in the middle of the night to urinate.
The inner peace of a person is inversely proportional to the strain of his body and spirit.
Absolute peace and contentment are available to everyone.
The only obstacle to enlightenment is our own negative energy and tension.
At the core of Tibetan Buddhism are the teachings of Buddha, which were supplemented by the Mahayana path of love and a number of methodologies from Indian yoga.
The essence of Tibetan Buddhism is very simple: it combines meditation, Kundalini yoga and love for all mankind.
Kundalini yoga practitioners claim that to awaken Kundalini energy (the energy of enlightenment), one must practice certain yoga poses, mantras and visualizations, as well as perform breathing exercises.
Divine yoga is a core part of Tibetan meditation practice, and visualizations of various gods help to clear energy channels, open chakras, and achieve enlightened consciousness.
During World War II, Germany was a common enemy, which led to the Soviet Union and the United States becoming allies. After the war, systemic, industrial, and cultural contradictions led to quarrels between the countries.
Two years after the end of hostilities, the Cold War begins - former allies become enemies.
It lasted for the next 40 years, and it really was a battle between friendly armies in different regions - from Africa to Asia, from Afghanistan to Cuba and many other places.
The Polish defences were broken by 17 September 1939. A retreat and regroup along the Romanian positions remained the only hope.
However, in one night, these plans were foiled when over 800,000 Red Army soldiers from the Belorussian and Ukrainian fronts entered the eastern regions of Poland in violation of the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other bilateral and multilateral international agreements.
Cargo shipment  is clearly the most efficient way to transport large numbers of people and cargo across the oceans.
Traditionally, the task of a navy has been to ensure that their country is able to outnumber its people and goods, and at the same time that the enemy is unable to outnumber its people and goods.
The North Atlantic Campaign of World War II is one of the most significant examples of this idea, where the Americans tried to transport people and materials across the Atlantic Ocean to help the British.
At the same time, the German Navy tried to stop the movement, using submarines mainly.
Germany could probably have conquered Britain in the same way that it had conquered the rest of Europe if the Allies had failed.
It seems that goats were first domesticated in the Iranian Zagros Mountains about 10,000 years ago.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to breed them so that they would always have milk, wool, meat, and skins available.
The goats were usually kept in herds, which were often herded up hills or on other pastures, and were often looked after by children or adolescents, who were often herders.
As early as the 16th century, there were paved roads in England.
Although the paved roads were mostly parallel wooden planks, they allowed the draught horses to move faster and pull heavier loads than the rough roads of the day.
The use of railway tracks to hold rails in place was very early, but it was later realized that the rails would be more efficient if they were covered with a strip of iron.
This practice became widespread, but because of the presence of iron, the wooden wheels of the carriages were quickly worn out.
The first all-metal rack wheels appeared in 1767, and the first all-metal rack wheels were made in the 17th century.
The first known means of transportation was the walking stick, and two million years ago, with the appearance of Homo erectus, which means "man walking upright", humans began to walk upright.
The Australopithecus, their predecessors, did not usually walk straight.
The first walking individuals of Australopithecus are found in fossils dating to 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, but it is possible that seven million years ago Sahelanthropus walked on two legs.
You can become more environmentally conscious, you can become involved in the environmental movement, you can even become an activist, so that in the future, these suffering will not be too great.
It often looks more like a symptomatic treatment, but when we want more than a temporary solution, we have to find and eliminate the root of the problem.
It's pretty obvious that the technological and scientific advances of humanity have changed the world dramatically, and the overcrowded and wasteful lifestyles of people have increased the number of problems.
After the July 4th declaration was adopted by Congress, its handwritten copy, signed by Congress Chairman John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson, was delivered to John Dunlap's printing press a few blocks away.
Overnight, between 150 and 200 copies were made, known today as the "Arkishi Dunlap".
On July 8, John Nixon read the document publicly for the first time in the courtyard of Independence Hall.
On July 6, George Washington received one of the copies, which he read to his troops in New York on July 9, and another copy arrived in London on August 10.
The first 25 printed copies of the Declaration of Independence (known as the Dunlap broadsides) have survived, although the original handwritten copy has not survived.
Many modern paleontologists believe that one group of dinosaurs managed to survive and that they are still alive today, but we call them birds.
Because of their feathers and their ability to fly, many people don't think of them as dinosaurs.
But birds still share many of the same features as dinosaurs.
They have claws and scales on their feet, they lay their eggs, and, like the Tyrannosaurus Rex, they walk on two hind legs.
Virtually all modern computers perform operations with binary-number information.
Binary numbers can have any of two values  0 or 1, and these numbers are called binary numbers, or (in computer jargon) bits.
Intrinsic intoxication may not have obvious signs, and for example, vomiting is a fairly common symptom, making it impossible to diagnose immediately.
The first indication of internal poisoning may be an open container with pills or toxic household chemicals.
The emergency medical instructions for this particular poison are to be found on the label.
For this group of insects, entomologists use the term klop in the formal sense.
The term "squat" comes from the fact that people have long known bed bugs to be highly adapted parasites on humans.
Both the kissing-wren and the bed-wren are nest-dwelling parasites, accustomed to living in nests or in the home of their host.
There are about 400,000 reported cases of multiple sclerosis in the United States alone, and it is the most common neurological disease among young to middle-aged adults.
Multiple sclerosis is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which includes the brain and spinal cord, and the optic nerve.
The study found that women were twice as likely as men to have MS.
A couple might conclude that raising a new baby is not in their best interests or in the best interests of the child they already have.
Such couples may give their child up for adoption.
Adoption is the process by which a child's biological parents relinquish their parental rights in order to allow other relatives to raise the child.
The main purpose of science is to use the scientific method to find out how the world works, and in fact, most scientific research is done using this method.
An experiment is a test that is conducted to rule out one or more possible hypotheses using questions and observations. It also provides a framework for and stimulates scientific research.
The classical texts were the most important source of philosophical and naturalist inspiration, especially the Bible in Latin.
The commonly held view at the time was that Aristotle's opinions on all scientific questions, including psychology.
As the number of Greek-speaking people decreased, the West was torn from its scientific and philosophical roots.
Many of the biorhythms that we observe in animal behavior and physiology are largely determined by these endogenous cycles, and the endogenous cycles are the result of the biological clock.
Most living things, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals, have been documented to have periodic rhythms that are not a direct response to external periodic signals.
Your biological clock is an autonomous process that, even when no external input is present, continues to run in a self-sustaining, self-regulating cycle.
One of the main hypotheses that DNA is genetic material was tested in the Hershey-Chase experiment.
To implant their own DNA into the bacteria, Hershey and Chase used phages, or viruses, to do the same thing.
They performed two experiments, in which they labeled bacteriophage DNA with radioactive phosphorus or radioactive sulfur-containing proteins in bacteriophages.
Depending on the type of mutation, the amount of genetic material in which the mutation occurs, and whether the cells affected are germ line cells, mutations can have a wide variety of effects.
Only mutations in germ cells are heritable, while other mutations can lead to cell death or cancer.
Ecotourism attracts those people who have an interest in visiting different natural zones and territories, because they want to enjoy the general view and landscape, including, enjoy the observation of flora and fauna.
Examples of things that you can do in nature are fishing, hunting, bird watching, going to parks, and ecosystems.
An example is the visit, study, and photographing of orangutans on the island of Borneo.
People drive out of their cars every morning from small provincial towns to go to work, and other people pass by who work in the towns they just left.
In this dynamic transportation loop, everyone is involved in some way in and contributes to the private car-based transportation system.
Scientific evidence suggests that the modern high-carbon economy has disrupted the stability of the biosphere, which has largely contributed to human evolution over the past two million years.
Transportation systems are used by everyone who participates in the public sphere, and most of them are not happy with the transportation systems.
In developed countries, you don't hear so many complaints about collapsing bridges or water quality.
Transportation systems are a constant source of these complaints, do they break down regularly, are there not enough transportation engineers, or is something more important going on?
The concept of transport movement implies the analysis of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points, as well as the study of how they interact with each other.
Unfortunately, studying traffic flows presents a difficult problem because you can't predict the behavior of drivers with 100 percent certainty.
Drivers, fortunately, tend to behave in a fairly consistent way, so transport flows tend to have a rational sequence that can be approximated by mathematical models.
To more fully and qualitatively represent what vehicle movement is, it was established how its three basic parameters are related to each other: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) velocity.
Having these connections helps to plan and design road structures, as well as deal with their operation.
Insects were the first animals to take to the air, and their ability to fly helped them avoid predators, find mates and food, and do so more efficiently.
In most cases, the insects' wings fold along the body.
And this allows them to build up into tiny little holes to hide from predators.
Strutter and single-winged flies are the only insects that can't fold their wings.
A man named Aristarchus, a few thousand years ago, argued that the solar system revolves around the sun.
Some thought he was right, but many others thought otherwise - that the solar system (including the sun and other stars) revolved around the earth.
Sounds reasonable, because it's hard to say that the Earth is moving, right?
The Amazon River is the second-longest river on Earth and the largest, with a volume of water eight times that of the second-longest river.
The widest river on Earth is the Amazon, sometimes six miles wide.
The Amazon is the source of at least 20 percent of all the water that flows into the oceans of the world.
The Amazon River, into which thousands of smaller rivers flow, is 6,387 km (3,980 miles) long.
Although the construction of the pyramids continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the size and technical perfection of the structure could never be surpassed by the pyramids of Giza.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom were fascinated by the monuments of their ancestors, which were over a thousand years old at the time.
With only about 800 people living in the Vatican, it is the world's smallest independent country with the smallest population.
Italian is the language of legislation and official communications in the Vatican.
Most of those who work in the public sector use Italian as a daily language, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All the inhabitants of the Vatican belong to the Roman Catholic Church.
Because the basic chemical elements (such as gold, silver, and copper) occur naturally in nature and are relatively easy to extract with primitive tools, people have known about them since ancient times.
The philosopher Aristotle proposed a theory that all things were composed of one element or a mixture of some of the four elements (earth, water, fire, and air).
Rather, it looked like the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although his theory was that these could transform into other substances and eventually become what we observe.
In most cases, alloys are mixtures of two or more metals, so keep in mind that the periodic table contains a large number of elements.
Elements like calcium and potassium are considered metals, and of course there are metals like silver and gold.
In addition, some alloys contain a small amount of non-metallic components, such as carbon.
Matter is the stuff of which everything in the universe is made. All matter is made up of tiny particles  atoms.
Atoms are so small that there are trillions of them in the dot at the end of this sentence.
So when the pencil came along, it became a good friend to a lot of people.
Unfortunately, the pencil's importance and frequency declined as new writing techniques emerged.
People are now typing messages on their computers, and no one needs a keyboard.
We can only imagine the fate of the keyboard when it is replaced by something entirely new.
The plutonium bomb uses the energy of the fusion of a nucleus with a large number of protons and neutrons.
It's like rolling a very heavy cart up a hill, and splitting the nucleus again releases some of that energy.
Some atomic nuclei are volatile, meaning that they tend to decay with little or no external interference.
The surface of the Moon is made of rocks and dust, and the outer layer of the Moon is called the crust.
The thickness of the crust on the near side is about 70 km, and on the far side is about 100 km.
Under the lunar marim, the Moon's corona is thinner, and under the highland  thicker.
Lunar seas may be more prominent on the nearer side of the moon because the crust is thinner, and therefore the lava is easier to get to the surface.
The most relevant theories focus on what drives people or what attracts people.
The theories mentioned above are based on the idea that people have certain needs and/or desires, which they turn into inner ones and which are given subjective character (in other words, internalized) during the aging process.
They're all about describing what makes people want to do what they do, and what factors in their environment might make them want to do that.
Maslow's hierarchy of needs theory and Hertzberg's two-factor theory are two authoritative content theories.
Basically, there are two types of behavior that managers may engage in when they take over their former colleagues: At one end of the spectrum, they're trying to stay "their boyfriend" (or "their girlfriend").
The manager belonging to this type may have difficulty in evaluating work efficiency, making unpopular decisions, applying disciplinary measures, distributing responsibility and holding accountable those responsible.
The other extreme is when the individual is so overwhelmed that they feel the need to change everything that the team has done so far, and they take it upon themselves.
Ultimately, the responsibility for the success or failure of the team rests with the leader.
It's not uncommon for this type of behavior to end in arguments between the leaders and the other members of the team.
The standards of excellence for real teams should be the same for virtual teams, but there are some minor differences.
Usually virtual team members act as a contact center for the relevant real group.
Given that such teams can meet outside of time zones, they often have more freedom than members of traditional teams, which may not be understandable to local leadership.
Another unique component of a distributed virtual team  is the presence of a true  invisible team (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p109).
The management team that each member is accountable to is called the "supervisory team", which sets the standards for each member.
What is the reason for an organization to want to go through the long process of becoming a learning organization?
Creativity and ingenuity can come to the fore when functional departments in an organization make efficient use of all available resources.
So the process that an organization uses, where people work together to overcome a barrier, can lead to a new innovation that meets the needs of the client.
The management of the organization has to create a culture of innovation, knowledge sharing, and organizational learning, so that the organization can be called innovative.
In Engel (2006), the continuum approach is a method by which organizations can achieve higher efficiency.
So, this theoretical approach to the study of cognition is backed up by physical evidence in the form of neurobiological data, and that narrows the field of study to a more specific, more precise one.
Researchers have received a number of studies that show a strong correlation between brain pathologies and behavioural changes.
It's been known for a long time that various types of brain injuries, concussions, brain lesions, plaques, pathological changes and tumors in the brain all affect behavior and alter some mental functions.
New technologies are making it possible to study the structure of the brain and the processes that are unknown to us.
But this gives us a huge amount of material and data that we can use to build simulation models, which in turn helps us understand the processes that are going on in our minds.
While the term "artificial intelligence" is usually associated with science fiction, in fact, AI is a very important branch of computer science that deals with the study of the behavior, learning process, and intellectual adaptation of computers.
AI research involves trying to get machines to automate tasks that need machines to behave intelligently.
Examples include planning and control, the ability to respond to customer requests and technical problems, and the ability to recognize faces, voices, and handwriting.
They've developed into their own disciplines, disciplines that take real-life problems and propose solutions to them.
Today, AI is used in a wide variety of fields, including economics, medicine, engineering, and the military, as well as being a component of software for some computer programs and video games.
Excursions are a big part of school learning, and teachers often take students to places that are not accessible by bus.
Today, technology allows students to take virtual tours, such as going to a museum, visiting an aquarium, or even seeing artwork, all without leaving the classroom.
Taking part in virtual tours together is also a great way to reflect on the trip and share experiences in future classes.
The students at Bennett High School in North Carolina, for example, they do a website about their trip to the state capital every year, and they re-create it every year, but it's still on the web in an album.
In addition, blogging can improve students' written language, and although students may have some "glitches" in grammar and spelling when they first start blogging, this usually changes for the better, thanks to the presence of the audience.
Given that students are usually the most picky audience, to avoid criticism, the blogger does his best to improve his style.
Beyond this, blogging "helps students better understand the world around them". The need to keep the audience curious inspires them and compels them to remain competent and interesting (Tota, 2004).
Blogging is a collaborative activity and it gives students a lot more to learn than the traditional school approach.
If students use blogs properly, they can develop analytical and critical thinking skills; active response to Internet materials helps students to outline their own position to written by other people, as well as to express their own views on individual problems (Oravets, 2002).
Ottawa  is Canada's interesting and charming bilingual capital. Here you can find numerous art galleries and museums, giving you the opportunity to get to know the country's past and its present.
The Niagara Falls lie further south, and to the north is Lake Muskoka, famous for its unspoiled natural beauty.
This, and many other reasons, is why tourists, visitors, and other outsiders see Ontario as Canada's "typical" province.
Large parts of the country further north are sparsely populated, and some are almost completely uninhabited.
As for the population, there is a fact that may surprise many: the number of African Americans in the United States is greater than the total population of Canada.
The East African Islands are located off the east coast of Africa and belong to the Indian Ocean archipelago.
Madagascar is undoubtedly the largest of the three, and when it comes to wildlife, it's like a continent.
Almost all of the smaller islands are either independent states or part of France, and are known for their luxurious beach resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam, which spread rapidly to the Comoros and the island of Mayotte.
The beginnings of European influence and colonial policy date back to the 15th century, when Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama found a sea route to India from Europe around the Cape of Good Hope.
The northern boundary of this region is the Sahel, and the southern and western boundaries are the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: Female tourists are always advised to say that they are married, even if they are not.
It may also be helpful to wear a ring (so that it does not look too expensive).
Women need to understand that because of cultural differences, they may encounter behaviors that they think are harsh, such as local men harassing tourists, or people holding hands, and so on.
Deny men and stand up for your rights (which is totally unacceptable, despite cultural differences!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC, and was used by the Phoenicians, Romans, and Merenids as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed the city and rebuilt it as Casa Branca (White House) after the 1755 earthquake, but abandoned it.
The Moroccan sultan restored the city and named it Dar al-Baji. The city was named Casablanca after the Spanish merchants who established trading bases there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to shop in all of Morocco.
Near the Old City of Medina, it is quite easy to find places where traditional Moroccan handicrafts are sold - leather goods, pottery, tajji, hoodies and various toys, but all of them are exclusively for tourists.
Goma is a city in the eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo near the border with Rwanda, popular with tourists.
In 2002, Goma was washed away by lava from the Nyiragongo volcano, which buried most of the city streets, mainly in the downtown area.
Despite the fact that the city of Goma itself is safe enough, in order to go outside its borders, it is worthwhile to conduct a small investigation to find out if there are any fighting in the province of North Kivu at any given moment.
In addition, the city serves as a base for climbing the volcano Nyiragongo. It also offers very cheap services for lovers of mountain gorillas observation  more attractive prices in Africa difficult to find.
To get around Goma, you can take a Bodo-bodo (motorcycle taxi) and the standard (local) price for a short trip is about 500 Congolese francs.
As a result of the comparative inaccessibility of Timbuktu, its name has come to be used as a metaphor for distant exotic places.
Despite its reputation as a tourist attraction and its airport, Timbuktu today is a city ruled by the poor.
In 1990, due to the threat of the desert sands, it was added to the list of World Heritage Sites in Danger.
Henry Louis Gates gave much attention to the city in his PBS program "The Wonders of Africa".
Compared to the rest of the country, the city stands out even more because it has more Arabic than African style.
Kruger National Park (NPC) is in the north-eastern part of South Africa. It is bordered by Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and the Krakatoa River to the south.
The park covers an area of 19,500 km2 and has 14 ecodes, each of which is home to different animals and plants.
It is one of the most visited national parks in the country and is considered the most significant of South Africa's National Parks.
As with all national parks in South Africa, the park charges a daily entrance fee and an environmental levy.
In addition, it may be beneficial to purchase a so-called Wild Card  subscription, which gives access to several parks in South Africa or all of South Africa's national parks.
The name Hong Kong is borrowed from the Hong Kong Island, which is a center of attraction for many tourists.
Hong Kong's beautiful buildings that shape the architectural face of the city are compared to a brilliant column chart, and Victoria Harbour's waters only highlight its presence.
The best views in Hong Kong are when you leave the island and head to the opposite coast of Kowloon.
Much of Hong Kong's urban fabric is compactly located along the northern coast in the drylands.
In the past, this area was occupied by British colonialists, so if you want to see the evidence of the country's colonial past, this is the place to start.
The Sundarbans is the world's largest coastal mangrove belt, extending 80 km (50 mi) from the coast into Bangladesh and into the interior of India.
The Sundarbans National Park is a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and is named after the Sundarbans National Park, a part of the forest in India.
It's not just the mangrove swamps that are called forests, it's some of the last remaining deaf jungle that once covered the Gangetic Plain and still exists.
The harbour covers an area of 3,850 km2, of which the reservoirs or marshes occupy about one-third.
The Sundarbans Forest has been a wildlife reserve since 1966, and currently, 400 royal Bengal tigers and about 30,000 spotted deer are reportedly found in the region.
Buses depart from the inter-district bus station (located across the river) throughout the day, however, the majority of buses depart between 06:30 and 07:30, especially those heading east and to Jakarta (located in the Boomtang district).
Due to the fact that inter-city buses are often crowded, tickets are recommended to be purchased a few days before the trip.
The handy and reliable small Japanese-made Coaster buses serve most areas.
A shuttle taxi is a comfortable and convenient way to reach nearby destinations, such as the cities of Punakha (travel cost  200 Nq) and Paro (travel cost  150 Nq).
The bridge, which crosses the Ayapoc, is a cable-stayed bridge that connects the banks of the Ayapoc River, which divides the cities of Ayapoc (Brazil) and Saint-Georges-de-Loup (French Guiana).
The bridge is 338 metres long and has two piers, each with a width of 3.50 metres.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 meters. The bridge was opened to traffic only in March 2017, despite the fact that its construction was completed in August 2011.
According to the schedule, the bridge will become fully functional in September 2017, after the completion of the construction of the Brazilian customs checkpoints.
The Guaraní, who lived the life of bullfighters and also engaged in subsistence agriculture, were the most significant group of indigenous peoples that inhabited the territory of modern-day Eastern Paraguay.
Other indigenous groups, such as the Payagua and the Guaicuru, lived in the Chaco region, and relied on hunting, fishing, and gathering for survival.
Paraguay, formerly known as the "Gigantic Province of India", actually came into being in the 16th century, when Spanish conquerors encountered the indigenous peoples.
The Spanish began a 300-year period of colonization.
Paraguay has managed to preserve its identity and identity since the founding of Asunción in 1537.
Argentina is famous for having some of the best polo teams and players in the world.
In December, the biggest tournament of the year takes place on the polo grounds in Las Canitas.
At other times of the year, tournaments and smaller matches can be watched here.
Information about the tournaments and where to buy tickets for the polo matches can be obtained from the Argentine polo association.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Pound (FKP), which is equal in value to the British Pound (GBP).
In the Falkland Islands, currency can be exchanged only at the country's only bank, located in Port Stanley opposite the EFI West store.
As a rule, British pounds are accepted for payment anywhere on the islands, and Stanley itself accepts credit cards and U.S. dollars.
The remote islands probably won't accept credit cards, but they may accept British or American cash, so ask the islanders in advance for their payment method.
It's virtually impossible to exchange the local currency outside the Falklands, so do it before you go.
Because it lies south of the equator, Montevideo has winter while it has summer.
Montevideo is located in the subtropics: temperatures above +30°C in the summer months are common.
Winters can be deceptively cold there: the thermometer column rarely drops below zero, but the wind combined with the humidity makes the temperature feel lower than it actually is.
The rainfall is almost constant throughout the year, so there are no specific rainy or dry seasons.
Although many of the animals in the park are used to seeing people and don't need to be fed or disturbed, the wild animals are still wild.
The park advises keeping bears and wolves at a distance of at least 100 yards (meters) and other wild animals  25 yards (meters)!
Bison, moose, roe deer, bears, and almost any large animal can go on the attack, no matter how obedient they may seem.
Dozens of visitors are injured each year because of the lack of proper distancing, and you should avoid getting too close because these animals are big, wild, and potentially dangerous.
Bears and other wildlife are attracted to the smell, so avoid carrying or cooking food with strong flavours, and keep the camp clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The city, which has a population of just under 40,000, is located on the island of Upolu.
Apia has been in existence since the 1850s, and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
In 1889 the harbour became the site of the infamous naval confrontation when seven German, American and British ships refused to leave the harbour.
All but one of the British cruisers sank, with the loss of nearly 200 Americans and Germans.
The assassination of Supreme Leader Tupua Thomas Lealophy III ended a peaceful gathering in the city that had been held during the independence struggle organized by the Mau Movement.
Because of the harbours on either side of Auckland, there are a lot of beaches, and the most popular ones are in three areas.
The North Shore Beaches are located near North Harbor and stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south along the Pacific coast.
Most of the beaches are sandy, safe for swimming, and most have shade from semi-deciduous trees.
The elite suburbs of Mission Bay and St Helier's (Oakland's central district) in the Waitematā Harbour are home to the beaches of Tamaki Drive.
It's another crowded family beach with lots of shops.
The main local beer is known to the customers as Number one. This is a simple, but pleasant and refreshing drink. Another local beer is Manta.
You can taste French wines, but you'll want to try Australian and New Zealand wines.
Local tap water is completely safe and drinkable, but if you have concerns, bottled water is not a problem.
The idea of a Flat White is unknown to Australians, but espresso is a small black coffee, cappuccino is filled with cream instead of foam, and tea is brewed without milk.
The hot chocolate is just like in Belgium. Fruit juices are quite expensive, but they taste great.
Reef travel is available year-round and in large numbers, but injuries and injuries from any of these causes are rare.
We still advise you to follow the advice of the authorities, follow all the requirements and follow all the safety warnings very closely.
The Cuban jellyfish is found from October to April near the beaches and near the river banks north of the settlement of 1770.
Sharks do exist, but they rarely attack people, and most people avoid them.
The crested crocodile's main habitat is not in the ocean but in the estuaries north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance helps a traveler to avoid worrying about where to stay when they arrive at their destination.
Travel agents don't usually deal with specific hotels, but you may be able to book through a travel agent other accommodations, such as camping sites.
Typically, travel agents offer packages that include breakfast, airport transfers, or even a combination flight and hotel accommodation.
Also, if you need time to consider the offer or obtain any other documents (such as a visa) needed to reach your destination, the travel agent may hold your reservation.
It is recommended that you send your suggestions or requests to a travel agent rather than directly to the hotel.
The vast majority of people who go to a music festival choose to stay, and for most people, that's a hugely valuable experience.
You'll have to come early if you want to find a camping spot next to the music venue.
And remember, even if the main stage is gone, there may still be sections of the festival that are playing music from the far north.
Some festivals offer special camping facilities for families with young children.
Raim to find out where your cabin is when you cross the northern Baltic Sea in winter  the passage through the Illyrians may be accompanied by a dreadful noise and crackling which is particularly impressionable to people with sensory sensitivity.
