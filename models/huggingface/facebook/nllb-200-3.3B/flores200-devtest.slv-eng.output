This confirms the established theory that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, but it also provides information that fossils usually cannot, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists say that the animal's feathers were brownish on the upper side and pastel or carotenoid on the lower side.
The find also provides insight into the development of bird feathers.
Because dinosaur feathers lack a well-developed scaffold called a rib, but all other features of the feathers - the limbs and the hocks - are present, researchers have found that ribs very likely evolved later in evolution than other features.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were used not for escape but for temperature control or display. Although the tail is that of a young dinosaur, the researchers say the pattern suggests that the feathers are those of an adult rather than those of a juvenile.
Although the tail is that of a young dinosaur, the researchers believe that the pattern indicates that the feathers are those of an adult, not a juvenile.

The work was mostly theoretical, but the program was written to simulate the observations of the constellation Sagittarius.
The effect the team wanted to achieve would be caused by tidal forces between the dark matter in the galaxy and the dark matter in the Milky Way.
Just as the Moon attracts the Earth and causes tides, the Milky Way also has a powerful effect on the constellation Sagittarius.
Scientists were able to conclude that dark matter acts on other dark matter in a similar way to ordinary matter.
According to this theory, most of the dark matter around a galaxy is held in a ring of many small particles.

In France, elections have always been low-tech: voters hide in individual booths and insert a pre-printed sheet of paper with the marked choice in an envelope.
Once the official has confirmed the identity of the voter, the envelope is placed in the voting box and signed on the voter list.
French electoral law is quite strict about this procedure.
Since 1988, ballot boxes have had to be transparent so that voters and observers could see that there were no envelopes in them at the start of the election and that no envelopes had been added except those handed in by duly registered and authorized voters.
Candidates can send representatives to observe all parts of the process, and in the evenings, volunteers count the votes under strict supervision, following certain procedures.

Senior Police Inspector Chandra Shekhar Solanki said that the accused came to the court with their faces covered.
Although three people were in the house when the car struck, none of them was injured.
The driver suffered serious head injuries.
The road where the collision occurred was temporarily closed so that the emergency services could free the driver from the red Audi TT.
He was initially hospitalized at James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was later transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya was later charged by the Edinburgh Sheriff's Court with the murder of his son.
She's in custody awaiting arraignment and a trial, but eyewitness testimony can be unreliable, since her picture was posted everywhere.
This is standard practice elsewhere in the UK, but the Scottish courts operate differently, and the court has ruled that the publication of the photographs is potentially harmful.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee observes: "Journalists have been on a thin ice in publishing photographs of suspects and the like".
The Crown Prosecution Service, which is fully in charge of the prosecution, has indicated to reporters that it will not comment further until at least the indictment is filed.
It was revealed that the document would refer to a dispute over the borders that Palestine wants to establish on the borders before the 1967 Middle East war.
Other topics covered were the future status of Jerusalem, considered holy in both countries, and the Jordan Valley.
Israel demands a permanent military presence in the valley for ten years after the signing of the agreement, and the Palestinian Authority has agreed to only five years of such a presence.
The shooters in the additional pest control experiment were under the close scrutiny of the keepers, as the test is controlled and its effectiveness is assessed.
In cooperation with NPWS and Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) inc, qualified volunteers are recruited under the Sporting Shooters Association's sponsorship of the shooting programme.
According to Mick O'Flynn, executive director of conservation for the NPWS Parks and Heritage Service, the four shooters selected for the first shooting operation received extensive safety briefings and training instructions.
Martelly was sworn in yesterday by the nine-member Provisional Electoral Council (CEP).
This is Martelly's fifth CEP in four years.
Last month, the Presidential Commission proposed an early resignation of the Provisional Electoral Council as part of a package of measures to move the country closer to new elections.
The commission was Martelly's response to the nationwide anti-regime protests that began in October.
Protests, sometimes violent, have triggered failed elections, some of which were due to take place as early as 2011.
There have been approximately 60 reported cases of overheating of idle iPods, causing six fires and minor burns to four people.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) reported that it was aware of 27 accidents involving devices.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had notified it of 34 additional incidents of overheating, which the company had rated as "non-hazardous".
The response from the State Department was that Apple's postponement of the report was "truly regrettable".
Mariano was rocked by an earthquake at 07:19 local time (Friday at 21:19 GMT).
The Office of Crisis Management for the Northern Mariana Islands said that no damage had been reported in the country.
Also, the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center reported no signs of a tsunami.
A former Filipino policeman took a group of Hong Kong tourists hostage by hijacking their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza was shooting tourists with his M16 rifle.
A few hostages have been rescued and at least six are confirmed dead so far.
Six hostages, including children and elderly, were released earlier, as were the Filipino photographers.
The photographers replaced an elderly lady who had to go to the bathroom, and Mendoza was shot.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and took up the medical profession.
He trained as a midwife and in 1959 began working at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland.
While working at the hospital, Liggins began to research prematurity in his spare time.
His research shows that when added to the baby, the hormone accelerates the fetal development of the lungs.
According to Xinhua, government investigators found two "black boxes" of planes on Wednesday.
Luna and her fellow wrestlers have also paid their respects.
"Luna was the first queen of Extreme, my first manager, and she died on the night of the two moons, as unique as she was, a strong woman", said Tommy Dreamer.
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels commented that "Luna was just as weird as I am... maybe even more... I love her and I'm gonna miss her... I hope she's in a better place".
Among the 1,400 respondents to the 2010 federal election, the number of those opposed to Australia becoming a republic has risen by 8 percent since 2008.
The President of the Transitional Government, Julia Gillard, argued during the 2010 federal election campaign that in her opinion Australia should become a republic at the end of the reign of Queen Elizabeth II.
34 percent of those polled agree with the demand that Queen Elizabeth II be the last Australian monarch.
On the one hand, 29 percent of those polled believe that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, and on the other hand, 31 percent of those polled believe that Australia should not become a republic at all.
The Olympic gold medalist was supposed to swim the 100 and 200 meters freestyle and three relays at the Commonwealth Games, but his physical fitness was questionable because of his problems.
He was not allowed to take the medication he needs to relieve his pain, as it is forbidden at the games.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest prime number ever recorded on January 25.
The discovery, announced Tuesday, was confirmed by several people using various hardware and software by early February.
Comets could represent the source that brought water and organic matter to earth, which can be used to make proteins and which make life possible.
Scientists hope to find out how planets form, especially the Earth, which has been around for a long time since the comets hit the Earth.
Cuomo, 53, took office as governor earlier this year, and last month he endorsed a bill to legalize same-sex marriage.
He called the rumours "political gossip and nonsense".
They're predicting he'll run for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that the FAA claims would allow airplanes to fly shorter routes, thereby saving millions of gallons of fuel a year and reducing carbon emissions.
It uses satellite-based technology, rather than the old technology based on stationary radars, which allows the air traffic controller to more accurately determine the position of the aircraft and provide more precise information to the pilots.
No additional transport will be provided and no express train will stop at Wembley, and no car parking and ride-hailing services will be available on the surface.
Due to the fear of lack of transportation, there is a possibility that the game will be forced to be played behind closed doors, without the support of the team.
According to a study published Thursday in the journal Science, a new species of bird has appeared in the Galapagos Islands of Ecuador.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden have reported that a new species developed by crossing an endemic Darwin's stork, Geospizo fortes, with an introduced cactus stork, Geospizo fortes, in just two generations, although previously it was thought that this process took much longer.
Gold can be shaped into many different shapes, and it can be rolled into tiny shapes.
It can be rolled into a thin wire that can be twisted and sewn, or it can be forged or rolled into sheets.
Because it can be thinly flattened, it was sometimes used to decorate hand-painted pictures in books called illuminated manuscripts.
We call this the pH of a chemical, and you can make an indicator with red cabbage juice.
The juice changes colour depending on the acidity or alkalinity of the chemical.
The pH value of the test chemicals is determined by the amount of hydrogen (H in pH) ions.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have lost their electrons (hydrogen atoms are made up of one proton and one electron).
Mix both powders and form a ball with clean, wet hands.
The wetness on your palms will react with the outer layers, causing a strange sensation and a crust of some kind.
In the cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro, almost every house had a flushing toilet connected to a sophisticated sewage system.
Remains of the sewer system have been found in houses in Minoan cities in Crete and Santorini in Greece.
Baths were also found in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China, and in Roman civilization, they were sometimes part of public baths, where men and women mingled in mixed societies.
When you call someone who's thousands of miles away, you're using a satellite.
A satellite in space receives a call and then bounces it back down almost instantly.
Satellites are launched into space by rockets, and scientists in space use telescopes because the Earth's atmosphere distorts some of our light and vision.
To transport a satellite or telescope into space requires a huge rocket, more than 100 feet long.
The bicycle completely changed the world, and one of its most visible contributions is faster and easier transportation.
We have been transported by train, by car, and by many other means of transportation.
Below them are the more medium-sized cats, which eat medium-sized prey, everything from rabbits to antelopes to deer.
There are also many small cats (including wild domestic cats) that feed on much larger prey, such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret of their success is in the concept of a niche, a special job that each cat has to do to protect it from competition from others.
Leos are the most sociable of all cats, and they live in large groups called packs.
A flock may have one to three related males and up to 30 females and cubs.
As a large family of sisters and daughters, women are usually closely related to one another.
A pack of lions behaves much like a pack of wolves or dogs, animals that are surprisingly similar to lions (but not to other big cats) in behavior and are also very deadly to their prey.
The tiger is a good athlete and can climb (though not the best), swim, jump a great distance, and pull five times as hard as a strong man.
The tiger is in the same group (genus Panthera) as lions, leopards, and jaguars, and these four big cats are the only ones that can roar.
The tiger's roar is not as full and uniform as that of the lion, but more cutting-edge, howling and screaming.
The ocelot feeds on small animals, and if it can, it hunts monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds, and almost all the animals that the ocelot hunts are much smaller than it.
Scientists think that the otters track and search for food (prey) by scent, since they can smell where they have been on the ground.
Because of their night vision, they have excellent night vision and can move silently, preying by blending with their surroundings and then jumping on their prey.
When a small group of living organisms (a small population) moves away from the main population from which it originated (for example, if it moves across a mountain range or river or moves to a new island and it is difficult to return), it will often find itself in a different environment than it lived before.
This new environment has different resources and competitors, so the new population will need different characteristics or adaptations to cope with them.
The original population has not changed at all, they still need the same adaptations as before.
As a new population begins to adapt to its new environment, it becomes less and less like the other population.
Eventually, over thousands or even millions of years, populations will look so different that they cannot be considered to be the same species.
This process is called speciation, which means the emergence of new species, and speciation is an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce the oxygen that humans breathe and absorb the carbon dioxide that humans expel from their lungs (or exhale).
Photosynthetic plants produce food by the sun, and they also provide shade.
We make our houses and our clothes from plants, and most of the food we eat comes from plants, and animals couldn't survive without plants.
The Mosasaurus was the supreme predator of its time, so it feared nothing but other Mosasaurus.
Its long jaw contained more than 70 extra-sharp teeth, and in the sky it had extra teeth to catch anything that crossed its path.
We don't have exact figures, but it's possible that he had a cleft palate, fed on turtles, big fish and other mosasaurs, and may have even been a cannibal.
It also attacked any creature that stepped into the water; not even giant dinosaurs, such as the Tyrannosaurus, were a match for it.
Although their food would seem mostly familiar to us, the Romans had quite a few strange or unusual festive dishes, including wild boar, peacocks, snails and a type of rodent called polch.
Another difference was that while the poor and women sat on tables at the table, the rich men preferred to eat their meals together, lying on their backs during the meal.
Ancient Roman meals could not have contained the foods that came to Europe from America or Asia in later centuries.
For example, they had no corn, no tomatoes, no potatoes, no cocoa, and no ancient Roman had ever tasted chicken meat.
The Babylonians built a central temple to each god, supposedly representing the home of the individual god.
People offered sacrifices to the gods, and priests tried to satisfy the gods' needs with rites and festivals.
Each temple had an open temple courtyard and an inner sanctuary that could only be entered by the priests.
At times, they built special towers in the form of pyramids, called ziggurats, that were part of temples.
The top of the tower represented a special refuge for the god.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, the houses were not so important.
The Hebrew family lived mostly outdoors.
Women cooked in the courtyard; shops were merely open counters facing the street; houses were built of stone.
The land of Canaan was devoid of large forests, so the wood was extremely expensive.
Norse sagas say that Erik the Red was banished from Iceland for murder and that he discovered Greenland on his way west and named it Greenland.
However, despite his discovery, the Eskimo tribes were already living there.
Although Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland were all "Scandinavian" countries, there were many differences between their peoples, kings, customs, and history.
If you've seen the movie The Forgotten Manor, you might think that the back of the Declaration of Independence is a map of the treasure.
Although there is a note on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
On the back of the Declaration of Independence were the words "Original Declaration of Independence of July 4, 1776". The text is written on the bottom of the document, face down.
No one knows for sure who wrote it, but we do know that the large parchment document (29 3/4 inches by 24 1/2 inches) was preserved in the form of a scroll early in its life.
So it's possible that the notch was simply added as a label.
With the D-Day landings and the battles that followed, they had liberated northern France, but the south was still unliberated.
It was ruled by the "higher" French, who were the French who made peace with the Germans in 1940 and collaborated with the invaders instead of fighting them.
On August 15, 1940, Allied forces occupied southern France, an invasion called "Operation Dragoon".
In just two weeks, the Americans and the Free French Forces have liberated the south of France and are moving towards Germany.
A civilization is a unique culture, which is the society of a large group of individuals living and working together.
The word civilization comes from the Latin civilis, meaning citizen, and is cognate with the Latin civis, meaning citizen, and civitas, meaning city or city-state, which also indicates the size of the society.
City states are the precursors of nations. The culture of civilization involves the transmission of knowledge across generations, a lasting cultural footprint and considerable diffusion.
Minor cultures often disappear without leaving any significant historical traces, and thus cannot be considered true civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, the Thirteen Colonies, with the Articles of Confederation, first formed a weak central government, consisting of only a congress.
Congress had no power to enforce the levies, and since there was no national executive or judicial authority, it relied on state authorities to enforce its laws, which often refused to cooperate.
Moreover, it had no powers to repeal tax laws and tariffs between countries.
The addition of articles required the consent of all the Länder, but the individual Länder did not take the central authorities seriously, so their representatives were often absent.
The Italian national football team is the second most successful team in the world, along with the German national football team, and became the world football champion in 2006.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, hockey, ice hockey, and F1 racing.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern provinces, where Italians compete in international and Olympic games.
Japan has nearly 7,000 islands (the largest is Honshu), making it the seventh largest island in the world.
Because of the group of islands that Japan has, it is often called an archipelago from a geographical point of view.
Taiwan's origins date back to the 15th century, when European sailors who sailed past the island called it Ilha Formosa, or Beautiful Island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan and began to transform native grain production methods and employ Chinese laborers to work on rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the Qing Dynasty (16441912) military forces took control of Taiwan's western and northern coasts, and in 1885 declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire.
In 1895, the Qing dynasty government, after its defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, ceding control of Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu is made up of three main structures, the Intihuatana, the Tower of the Sun, and the Sanctuary of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the edges of the complex have been rebuilt to give tourists a better idea of what they originally looked like.
By 1976, 30 percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and the restoration is still going on today.
For example, the most widely used photographic format for still images in the world is 35 mm, which was the dominant film size at the end of the analogue film era.
It is still used today, but more importantly, its aspect ratio has also been adopted by the image-type formats of digital cameras.
The 35-mm format actually  and somewhat unusually  measures 36 mm in width and 24 mm in height.
So the aspect ratio of this format (divided by twelve to get the most basic ratio in the form of a whole number) is 3:2.
Many common formats (the ASP family of formats) are identical or very close to this ratio of height to width.
The oft-exploited and often-ridiculed rule of thirds is a simple guide that creates dynamism while providing the benchmark for image editing.
After that, the most efficient position for the main subject would be on the cross-section of the line dividing the image into vertical and horizontal thirds (see example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church came under scrutiny as it grew rich and expanded its authority.
For over a millennium, the Christian faith has bound Europe's nations together despite differences in language and customs.
Its omnipresent power affected kings as well as common people.
One of the main doctrines of Christianity is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that the church's funds are for that purpose.
The seat of the central authority of the church has been in Rome for over a thousand years, and this concentration of power and money has led many to question whether it really follows this principle.
Shortly after the outbreak of hostilities, Britain instituted a naval blockade of Germany.
The strategy of cutting off the most important military and civilian supplies has proved effective, but this blockade has violated generally accepted international law, codified by several international agreements over the last two centuries.
Britain has mined international waters to prevent ships from accessing entire stretches of ocean, endangering neutral shipping.
Because the response to this tactic was limited, Germany expected a similar response to unrestricted submarine warfare.
In the 1920's, pacifism and isolationism were the dominant positions of most citizens and nations.
After witnessing the horrors and atrocities of war during World War I, the nations wanted to avoid a similar situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States, where he took a job with the Edison Company in New York.
When he arrived in the United States, he had only 4 cents, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (the manager at his previous job), addressed to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China depicted the different time periods in a distinctive way; each stage of China or each family that held power was a recognizable dynasty.
There was also a period of instability between the dynasties, with provinces being divided, the most famous of which was the Three Kingdoms period between the Han and Jin dynasties, which lasted for 60 years.
During this period, there were fierce battles between many nobles, who fought for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms period was one of the bloodiest periods in the history of ancient China, as thousands died in the battle for the highest seat in the great palace of Xi'an.
There are many social and political effects, such as the adoption of the metric system, the transition from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism, and the belief that the state belongs to the people rather than to a single ruler.
In addition, the post-revolution professions were open to all male seekers, allowing the most ambitious and successful to succeed.
This is true in the military, too, because military ranks are now based on caliber rather than grade.
The French Revolution inspired many other oppressed members of the working class in other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was intensely interested in things beyond this earthly life, and he would visit the cave known as Hira on the mountain of Nur (the light) to meditate.
The cave itself, which has stood the test of time, gives a very clear picture of Muhammad's spiritual aspirations.
The cave, located on the top of a mountain north of Mecca, is completely cut off from the rest of the world.
In fact, it's not easy to find, even if we know it exists, and the inside of the cave offers complete privacy.
Apart from the clear, beautiful sky above and the many surrounding mountains, there is nothing to see, and from inside the cave, little of this world is seen or heard.
Of the Seven Wonders, only the Great Pyramid of Giza survives today.
Built by the Egyptians in the third century B.C.E., the Great Pyramid is one of many large pyramidal structures built in honor of the late Pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau, or the "Necropolis of Giza" in Egypt's Valley of the Dead, is home to several pyramids (the largest being the Great Pyramid), smaller tombs, temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was created in honor of Pharaoh Khufu, and numerous smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built in honor of Khufu's wives and family members.
The 'up' mark looks like a V and the 'down' mark like a link or a square without a bottom.
Up means you should start at the top of the bow and push it, down means you should start at the broom (that is, where your hand holds the bow) and pull the bow.
The bowstring from above is usually more subtle, while the bowstring from below is stronger and more decisive.
If you wish, you can draw your own curved markings with a pencil, but remember that printed curved markings are for the sake of music and should be considered.
The frightened King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their young child (Mary Theresa, aged 11, and Louis Charles, aged 4) and the king's sister, Lady Elizabeth, were forced by an angry mob of Frenchmen to withdraw from Versailles to Paris on October 6, 1789.
They were returning to Paris in a carriage surrounded by a crowd of people shouting and shouting threats against the King and Queen.
The crowd forced the king and queen to open the carriage windows.
At one point, someone in the crowd, in front of the terrified queen, waved the head of a member of the royal guard who had been killed at Versailles.
The military expenditure of American imperialism in the Philippines was paid by the Filipino people themselves.
They had to pay taxes to the American colonial regime to cover a larger part of the cost and interest on the bonds issued in the name of the Philippine government through Wall Street banking houses.
Of course, the gate-breaking profits derived from the long-term exploitation of the Filipinos would represent the basic income for US imperialism.
To understand the Templars, one must understand the context in which the order was created.
The period in which these events took place is commonly known as the High Middle Ages, which marks the period of European history in the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000-1300 C.E.).
The High Middle Ages were preceded by the Early Middle Ages, and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which by convention ends around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a wide range of ideas and practices, from technological endeavor or technological need to the idea that human destiny is driven by a fundamental logic associated with scientific laws and their application in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share the same general idea: that the development of technology itself follows a path that is strongly influenced by culture and politics, and that technology consequently produces "effects" on societies that are inherent rather than socially conditioned.
For example, you could say that as the automobile develops, so will the roads.
However, the public road network cannot be economically justified for only a few cars, and new manufacturing methods are being developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
Mass car ownership also leads to increased accidents on the roads, leading to the invention of new medical techniques for caring for injured bodies.
Cultural determinism, which he drew from writers such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel, was an important element of Romanticism.
In the case of Romanticism, individuals were shaped by geographical affiliation, and over time, customs and culture associated with a particular geographical area emerged that were in harmony with the state of society and thus superior to arbitrarily imposed laws.
Just as Paris is now known as the fashion capital of the modern world, Constantinople was once considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its reputation as a center of luxury was established around 400 C.E. and lasted until 1100 C.E.
Its status declined somewhat in the 12th century, as the crusaders returned home with gifts of silk and spices worth more than the Byzantine market could offer.
By this time, the fashion capital's title had moved from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style reached its peak between the 10th and 11th centuries and in the 14th century.
At first, the dress in the East bore strong traces of Byzantine culture.
But because of slow communication links, styles in the West could be 25 to 30 years behind.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style, and one of the greatest advances of the time, and the result of the Crusades, was the use of knobs to tighten clothing.
Self-sufficient agriculture is a term used for agriculture with the purpose of producing sufficient food to meet the needs of the farmer and his family.
Self-sufficient farming is a simple, often ecological system using saved seeds from the same ecological region, combined with rotation or another simple technique to ensure the best possible harvest.
In the past, most farmers were self-sufficient, as they still are in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together like-minded people who feel that social norms have overlooked them, and allow them to develop their own identities.
Subcultures may differ by age, ethnicity, class, location and/or gender of its members.
The characteristics that make a subculture distinctive may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographic, or a combination of factors.
Members of a subculture often show their affiliation through the distinctive and symbolic use of style, which includes fashion, mannerism, and slang.
One of the ways that is most often used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to take a few unfortunate examples of children who were not socialized by adults during their adolescence due to neglect, unfortunate circumstances, or intentional abuse.
Some werewolf children were imprisoned by humans (usually their parents); this form of child abuse was in some cases the result of the parents' rejection of the child's more severe mental or physical disabilities.
Before being abandoned or fleeing, wild children may have been subjected to severe abuse or trauma in childhood.
Others were said to have raised animals; some are said to have lived in the wild themselves.
When wild-caught babies are fully reared by nonhuman animals, their behavior (within physical limits) is almost exactly the same as that of the foster animals, such as fear or indifference to humans.
Project-based learning should be easier and more interesting, but it goes a step further.
Learning is not a learning method but rather a supporting tool for individuals who are learning something new, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
The boxes can be virtual or real, in other words, the teacher is the form of the boxes, but this also applies to the little link in Microsoft Office.
Virtual audits are an internal part of software and are intended to ask questions, encourage and explain processes that could be too challenging for the learner to do alone.
Children are placed in foster care for a variety of reasons, ranging from neglect to abuse and even extortion.
No child should grow up in an environment that is not stimulating, loving, and educational, and yet it is happening.
We think the foster care system is a safe zone for these kids.
Our foster care system should provide safe homes, loving caregivers, stable education and reliable health care.
The police were to provide all the necessaries of life that were not in the home from which they had been previously removed.
The Internet combines elements of mass and interpersonal communication.
The inherent characteristics of the Internet allow for new dimensions in terms of use and access to reward.
For example, learning and socialization are thought to be important motivators for using the Internet (James et al., 1995).
Personal involvement and personal relationships were also identified as a new aspect of motivation by Eighmey and McCord (1998), who studied how the public responds to websites.
Video recording has made important discoveries in the interpretation of microtraction, facial movements lasting only a few milliseconds.
In particular, they say that by correctly interpreting microexpressions, it is possible to detect whether a person is lying.
In his article The President's Speech, Oliver Sacks explained that people who cannot understand speech because of brain damage are nevertheless able to accurately assess sincerity.
He even suggests that animals, such as domestic dogs, have such abilities to interpret human behavior.
Research in the 20th century has shown that there are two sets of genetic variations: hidden and expressed.
Mutation adds a new genetic variation, and selection removes it from the set of variations that are expressed.
Separation and recombination with each generation redistribute the variation back and forth between the two sets.
A primate with a digestive system similar to that of humans, with plant sources available in the savannah, has a hard time meeting its amino acid needs.
Moreover, if these needs cannot be satisfied, there are serious consequences: stunting, malnutrition, and eventual death.
The easiest plant sources to access would be proteins, found in leaves and leaf buds, which are difficult for primates, including us, to digest if they are not cooked.
By contrast, animal foods (ant, termite, eggs) are not only easily digested but also a source of high-quality protein containing all the essential amino acids.
All things considered, it should not surprise us that our ancestors solved their "protein problem" in a way somewhat similar to the way chimpanzees do in the savannah today.
Sleep interruption is a process during which you intentionally wake up during your normal sleep time and fall back asleep shortly afterwards (every 10 to 60 minutes).
You can do this with a relatively quiet alarm clock that will wake you up but not wake you up.
If you happen to reset your alarm clock while you sleep, you can set it on the other side of the room and thus force yourself to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other options based on biorhythms include drinking large amounts of fluids (especially water or tea, which is a known diuretic) before going to bed, which forces the person to get up and go for a drink.
The amount of inner peace an individual has is inversely proportional to the amount of tension in an individual's body and mind.
The lower the tension, the more positive life force is present, and every human being has the potential to achieve absolute peace and contentment.
The only thing that's standing in the way of that goal is our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but it also draws on the Mahayan way of love and many techniques from Indian yoga.
Tibetan Buddhism is very simple in principle, made up of yoga, kundalini, meditation, and the path of unconditional love.
Kundalini yoga, with its yogic postures, breathing exercises, mantras, and visualizations, is a means of awakening the energy of the kundalini (energy of enlightenment).
Central Tibetan meditation is a form of deity yoga, where the visualization of various deities clears energy channels, activates chakras, and creates an enlightened consciousness.
Because Germany was a common enemy during World War II, the Soviet Union and the United States began to cooperate, and after the war, systemic, procedural, and cultural differences led to a rift between the two countries.
Two years after the war ended, former allies became enemies, and the Cold War began.
It lasted for the next 40 years, and the fighters fought for real, with proxy armies, on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba, and many other places.
By 17 September 1939, the Polish defences had been broken, and the only hope was a retreat and repositioning along the Romanian bridgehead.
But these plans became obsolete practically overnight when 800,000 troops of the Soviet Union's Red Army moved in and established a Belarusian and Ukrainian front after occupying eastern Polish regions, in contravention of the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Nonaggression Pact, and other international treaties, both bilateral and multilateral.
Using a cargo ship is by far the most efficient way to move large numbers of people and goods across the oceans.
The traditional role of the Navy was to ensure that the state maintained its ability to move people and goods while limiting the enemy's ability to move their people and goods.
One of the most notable recent examples of this was the North Atlantic campaign of World War II, in which the Americans tried to bring men and materiel across the Atlantic to help the British.
At the same time, the German Navy wanted to stop this kind of traffic with U-boats.
If the Allied powers had failed, Germany would have probably succeeded in taking Britain as well as the rest of Europe.
Goats are believed to have been first domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to cultivate them for easy access to milk, hair, meat and skin.
Domestic goats were mostly herded in flocks that roamed hills or other pasturelands, and were often tended by goat herders, who were rarely children or teenagers, much like the more famous sheep herders.
In England, the railway was built in the 16th century.
Although the wagonways consisted of only parallel platforms, they allowed the horses to reach higher speeds and to pull heavier loads than on the somewhat worse roads of the time.
Soon, thresholds were used to hold the rails in place, and it was gradually found that the rails were more efficient if they had a strip of iron at the top.
This became a universal practice, but iron made the wooden wheels on the carriages wear out more quickly.
Wood wheels were eventually replaced by iron ones, and in 1767 the first all-iron rails were introduced.
Walking was the first known means of transportation, and humans began walking upright about two million years ago, with the appearance of Homo erectus (or upright man).
Their ancestor, the Australopithecus, did not walk upright.
Two-legged walking traits are present in fossil Australopithecus from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, but the hominid Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can make our lives more environmentally friendly, we can join the environmental movement, we can even become activists to reduce some of the suffering in the future.
In many cases, this is similar to symptomatic treatment, but if we want more than a temporary solution, we must find the root of the problem and correct it.
Clearly, the world has changed dramatically because of man's scientific and technological advances, but problems have also increased because of overpopulation and man's wasteful life-style.
After it was adopted by Congress on July 4, the handwritten draft, signed by Congress president John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson, was sent a few blocks away to John Dunlap's printing plant.
At night, between 150 and 200 copies were made, known as "Dunlap's Flyers".
The document was first read publicly by John Nixon on July 8 in the courtyard of Independence Hall.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6, which he had read to his troops in New York on July 9, and a copy reached London on August 10.
Twenty-five Dunlap tracts still exist, which are considered the oldest surviving copies of this document, since the original handwritten copy has not survived.
Today, many paleontologists believe that one group of dinosaurs survived and is still alive today, and we call them birds.
A lot of people don't think of them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and they can fly.
Yet, birds and dinosaurs share many similarities.
They have scales and claws on their feet, lay eggs and walk on their hind legs like tyrannosaurs.
Virtually all computers we use today are based on the manipulation of information encoded in binary numbers.
A binary number can have only one of two values, i.e. 0 or 1, these two numbers are called binary digits  or bits, if we use computer jargon.
Internal intoxication is not always the most obvious, but signs such as vomiting are common enough to make an immediate diagnosis impossible.
The main indication of internal poisoning is the possible presence of an open container of medication or toxic household chemicals.
Check the label to see if the specific first aid instructions are given for this particular poison.
Entomologists officially use the term "insect" for this group of insects.
This term derives from a prehistoric relationship with the prickly pear, a highly evolved human parasite.
Both predatory flies and larvae are nesting animals that are adapted to live in the nest or the home of their host.
In the United States, there are approximately 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), making it the leading neurological disease of young adults and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which includes the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerves.
Research shows that women are twice as likely to develop MS as men.
A couple may decide that caring for a child is not in their best interests or in the best interests of their child.
These couples can choose an adoption plan for their child.
Adoption is when the biological parent gives up his or her parental rights so that another couple can take on the role of the child's parents.
The primary goal of science is to find out how the world works by using the scientific method, which actually guides most scientific research.
But that's not all, because an important part of scientific research is testing, where testing is a test that is designed to rule out one or more possible hypotheses, asking questions, and observing.
Naturalists and philosophers turned to classical texts, especially the Latin Bible.
Aristotle's views were adopted in all fields of science, including psychology.
With the decline of Greek, the Western world broke with its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Most of the observed rhythms in psychology and behavior are often dependent on the presence of endogenous cycles and their formation by means of biological clocks.
Repetitive rhythms, not simply responses to periodic external stimuli, have been recorded in most living things, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that continue periods of uninterrupted cyclic repetition even in the absence of external stimuli.
The Hershey and Chase experiment was one of the main hints that DNA is genetic material.
Hershey and Chase implanted their own DNA into the bacteria using phages or viruses.
They did two experiments where they labelled DNA in a flask of radioactive phosphorus or a protein flask with radioactive sulfur.
The effects of mutations can vary greatly depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the part of the genetic material affected, and whether germ cells are affected.
Only germ cell mutations can be passed on to children, while other mutations can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature tourism attracts people interested in visiting natural areas to enjoy the beauty of the landscape, including plants and wildlife.
Field activities include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching and park visits, and the study of ecosystem information.
Seeing, photographing, and learning about the orangutans of Borneo is one such example.
Every morning, people leave their small rural towns in cars to go to work, and those who work in the town they just left are driven past.
In this dynamic transportation, everyone is somehow connected to and supports the car-based transportation system.
Science now shows that a massive carbon economy has pushed the biosphere out of one of its stable states that has supported human evolution for the last two million years.
Everyone in society is a participant in and a user of transportation systems, and almost everyone complains about transportation systems.
In developed countries, you rarely hear similar complaints about water quality or the collapse of bridges.
Why are transportation systems so often the cause of complaints, why do they fail every day, or is it the incompetence of transportation engineers?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions they have with each other.
Unfortunately, studying traffic flow is difficult because the driver's behavior cannot be predicted with 100 percent certainty.
Fortunately, drivers' behaviour is usually fixed to some extent, so traffic flows are fixed and can be roughly represented in mathematical form.
To better illustrate the traffic flow, the relationships between the three main characteristics were established: (1) flow, (2) density and (3) speed.
These relationships help in the planning, design and operation of roads.
The beetles were the first animals to take to the air, and their ability to fly made them more adept at avoiding enemies and finding food and mating partners.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings along their body.
This gives them even more opportunity to hide from predators.
Today, the only insects that cannot fold their wings over the body are the snake-herder and the day-fly.
A thousand years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system revolves around the sun.
Some thought he was right, while many believed the opposite - that the solar system, including the sun (and even other stars), revolved around the earth.
That seems reasonable, because we don't have the sensation that the Earth is moving, right?
The Amazon River is the second longest and largest river on earth, containing more than eight times as much water as the second largest river.
The Amazon, with a catchment area of up to six miles wide, is also the widest river on earth.
As much as 20 percent of the water that flows from the world's rivers into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The main Amazon River is 3,980 miles long, and thousands of smaller rivers join it.
Although the building of pyramids with stone continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the size of the pyramids at Giza and the technical expertise of their construction were never surpassed.
During the New Kingdom, the Egyptians admired the monuments of their ancestors, which were then more than a thousand years old.
With a population of about 800, Vatican City is the smallest independent state in the world and the least populous.
In the Vatican, legislation and official communication are in Italian.
Italian is also the everyday language used by most of the country's workers, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of the Vatican are Roman Catholics.
Basic chemical elements, such as gold, silver, and copper, have been known to man since antiquity, for they are all found in their original form in nature and can be mined quite easily with simple tools.
The philosopher Aristotle theorized that everything was made up of a mixture of four elements: earth, water, air, and fire.
In essence, there were more than four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although he claimed they transformed into new substances and formed what we see.
Alloy is basically a mixture of two or more metals, and remember, there are many elements in the periodic table.
Elements like calcium and potassium are considered metals, and of course there are metals like silver and gold.
There are also alloys containing small amounts of non-metallic elements, such as carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter, and all matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so small that you could make them into trillions in a dot at the end of this sentence.
Thus, the pencil was a dear friend to many.
Unfortunately, new writing methods have emerged and the pencil has been pushed to the side of the pen.
People are now writing messages on computer screens and not even coming close to the spokes.
We can only wonder what the keyboard will be like when something new comes along.
The way the fission bomb works is that it takes energy to fuse a nucleus with lots of protons and neutrons.
It's like pushing a heavy cart into a log, and part of that energy is then released by re-injection of the core.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means they usually decay on their own or almost without help.
The surface of the moon is made of rock and dust, and the outer layer of the moon is called the crust.
The crust is about 70 kilometres thick on the near side and 100 kilometres on the far side.
The bottom of the sea is thinner, but the top of the skies is thicker.
There could be more pools on the near side, because the crust is thinner, and the lava would have been more likely to rise to the surface.
Content theories focus on finding what drives people forward or what pleases them.
These theories say that people have certain needs and/or desires that they internalize as they grow up.
These theories explore what it is that makes some people want the things they want, and what things in the environment will set them up to do or not do certain things.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs and Herzberg's two-factor motivation theory.
When managers start to lead their former colleagues, it is generally accepted that they can start behaving in one of two ways.
Such a leader has difficulty making unpopular decisions, implementing disciplinary measures, evaluating the performance of workers, assigning tasks and taking responsibility for mistakes made.
On the other hand, we can turn into an unrecognizable individual who thinks he has to change everything the team has done and chart a course of his own.
After all, the leader is primarily responsible for the success or failure of the group.
Such behavior often creates a gap between the leader and the rest of the team.
Virtual groups strive for the same standards of excellence as conventional groups, but there are still small differences.
Virtual group members often act as a contact point for their live physical group.
They tend to have more freedom than the ordinary members of the group, as their groups have to adapt to more time zones, which their local leadership sometimes does not have the capacity to do.
Another characteristic component of a virtual group is the presence of a real 'invisible group' (Larson and LaFasto, 1989: 109).
The 'invisible team' is the management team, which reports to the individual members.
Why should an organisation undergo the time-consuming process of establishing a learning organisation?
When the departments of the organisation that operate effectively use the resources available, creativity and inventiveness can be triggered.
Thus, a new innovative process can emerge in the process of collaboration within the organisation to overcome barriers and meet the needs of customers.
Before a given organisation can become innovative, management must establish an innovation environment and promote shared knowledge and organisational learning.
Angel (2006) defines the continuity approach as a method used to help organisations achieve higher levels of efficiency.
Neuroscience data provide physical evidence for a theoretical approach to the study of cognition, so they narrow the field of research and increase its accuracy significantly.
The link between brain pathology and behavior supports the thesis in the research of scientists.
It has long been known that various types of brain injuries, traumas, lesions, and tumors affect behavior and lead to changes in some mental functions.
The advent of new technologies allows us to see and investigate brain structures and processes never before seen.
And this gives us a lot of information and material to build simulation models that help us understand how the processes in our heads are going.
While AI has a strong science fiction flavor, it is a very important branch of computing that deals with the behavior, learning, and intelligent adaptation of machines.
Research in AI involves building machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include supervision, scheduling and scheduling, the ability to respond to client diagnoses and questions, and handwriting, voice and facial recognition.
Those things have become separate industries that focus on providing solutions to real-life problems.
The AI system is widely used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering and the military, as it is embedded in many personal computer and video game software.
Excursions are an important part of any class, and teachers often take students to places that are not accessible by bus.
Technology offers a solution through virtual field trips, where students can visit museum artifacts, visit aquariums or admire art from the classroom.
Posting the trip reports online is also a great way to reflect on the trip and share the experience with future classes.
For example, every year, students at Bennett in North Carolina create a website about their trip to the state capital, the website is redesigned every year, but the old versions remain online and serve as a memory album.
Although most students start their online diaries with superficial grammar and spelling, this is usually changed by the presence of an audience.
Since students can often be the most demanding audience, the blog writer begins to work on improving his writing to avoid criticism.
In addition, blogging "forces students to become more aware of the world around them". The need to attract the attention of the public inspires students to want to be smart and interesting (Toto, 2004).
The online diary is a tool to encourage cooperation and the students' commitment to learning even when they are not in school.
The appropriate use of online diaries "can encourage students to think more analytically and critically; by constantly responding to online material, students can determine their position in relation to the writings of others and shape their own view on certain topics (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada's charming, bilingual capital, and boasts numerous art galleries and museums that showcase Canada's past and present.
A little to the south are Niagara Falls, and to the north are the pristine natural beauties of the Muskoke Glacier.
All of these and many more make Ontario a prime example of what foreigners consider to be typical Canadian landscapes.
The vast areas further north are quite sparsely populated, and some areas are almost uninhabited wilderness.
The comparison may surprise many: The United States has more African Americans than Canadians.
The East African Islands lie in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest and most isolated continent, considering its fauna and flora.
The smaller islands are mostly independent states or linked to France and are known as luxurious seaside resorts.
The Arabs also introduced Islam, which became strongly established in the Comoros and the island of Mayotte.
The beginnings of European influence and colonization date back to the 15th century, when Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama found a route from Europe to India around Africa.
The region borders the Sahel to the north, and the Atlantic Ocean to the south and west.
Women: We recommend that all female travelers say they are married, regardless of actual marital status.
It also helps to wear a ring (but not one that looks valuable.
Women should be aware that cultural differences can create the impression of harassment, and it is not uncommon for them to be followed, grabbed by the hand, etc.
Reject men firmly and do not be afraid to defend your position (this is not acceptable, regardless of cultural differences).
Modern Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century B.C.E., and was used as a strategic port by the Phoenicians, Romans, and the Meronids under the name of Anfa.
It was destroyed and rebuilt by the Portuguese as Casa Branca, and then abandoned after the 1755 earthquake.
The city was rebuilt as Daru l-Badya by the Moroccan sultan, and it was named Casablanca by Spanish merchants who established trading posts there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to shop in all of Morocco.
It is not difficult to find places around the old Medina selling traditional Moroccan goodies such as tagine, pottery and leather goods, water pipes and a wide range of geegaws, but all of these are aimed at tourists.
Goma is a tourist town in the far east of the Democratic Republic of Congo near Rwanda.
In 2002, the city of Goma was devastated by lava from the Nyiragongo volcano, which buried most of the streets and especially the city center.
Although Goma is safe enough, it is necessary to explore beyond Goma to understand the ongoing conflict in the province of North Kivu.
It is also the starting point for the ascent of Nyiragongo and for some of the best mountain gorilla tracking in Africa.
You can travel around Goma by bo-bodo (motor taxi) for a short ride at the usual (local) price, which is about 500 Congolese francs.
Because it is also quite difficult to reach, "Timbuktu" is used as another name for exotic, distant lands.
Although its reputation as a tourist attraction and its airport have made it a popular destination, Timbuktu is today a deprived city.
In 1990, the sand dunes threatened the site, which was added to the list of World Heritage in Danger.
It was one of the main stops of the PBS special broadcast of Henry Louis Gates' "Wonders of the African World".
This city is completely different from other cities in the country, because it has more of an Arab flavor than an African one.
Kruger National Park (KNP) lies in the north-east of South Africa and extends along the border with Mozambique in the east, Zimbabwe in the north, and the Crocodile River in the south.
The park covers 19,500 km2 and is divided into 14 different ecological areas, each supporting a different group of wild fauna and flora.
It is one of the biggest attractions in South Africa and is considered the showpiece of the South African National Parks (SANParks).
A daily entrance fee is required for conservation and park visits, as in any South African national park.
Perhaps it would be a bad idea to buy a Wild Card, which grants access to selected parks in South Africa or to all South African national parks.
The territory of Hong Kong is named after Hong Kong Island and is a major stop for many tourists.
The row of buildings that make up the skyline of Hong Kong are linked by a glittering column chart, highlighted by the presence of Victoria Harbour's water.
For the best views of Hong Kong, leave the island and head to the opposite coast of Kowloon.
Urban development on the Hong Kong islands is largely concentrated in the re-connected territory along the north shore.
This city was taken over by the British colonialists as their own, so it's a good starting point to see the remnants of the area's colonial past, if that's what you're interested in.
The Sundarbans is the largest coastal strip of mangroves in the world, stretching 80 km (50 mi) from the coast into the interior of Bangladesh and India.
The Sundarbans has been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and part of the forest within Indian territory is called the Sundarbans National Park.
But these forests are not just mangrove swamps. They include some of the last surviving remnants of the mighty jungles that once overran the Ganges Basin.
The Sundarbans covers a large area of 3,850 km2, of which about one third is covered by water/wetland areas.
Since 1966 the Sundarbans have been a wildlife sanctuary, and it is estimated that there are now 400 Bengal tigers and some 30,000 tiger herons in the area.
Buses run from the inter-city bus station (across the river) all day long, most of them, especially those heading east and to Jakarta/Bumthang, from 6:30 a.m. to 7:30 a.m.
Since long-distance buses are often full, it is advisable to buy your ticket a few days in advance.
Most districts offer small Japanese minibuses that are comfortable and durable.
The use of shared taxis allows for quick and comfortable travel to nearby towns such as Paro (No. 150) and Punakha (No. 200).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge that spans the Oyapock River and connects the city of Oiapoque, Brazil, to Saint Georges de l'Oyapock, French Guiana.
The towers are 273 feet high, 1,298 feet long, and have two 12-foot-wide passageways.
The bridge is 15 metres high and was built in August 2011 but opened to traffic in March 2017.
The bridge is expected to be operational by September 2017, when the Brazilian customs checkpoints are also expected to be completed.
The Guarani, who lived as nomadic hunters and engaged in subsistence agriculture, were the most important indigenous group inhabiting the territory of present-day eastern Paraguay.
Other indigenous tribal groups, such as the Guaycurú and the Payaguá, lived in the Chaco region and made their living by hunting, gathering food, and fishing.
Paraguay, sometimes called the "great Indian province", developed in the 16th century as a result of the encounter between the Spanish conquistadors and the indigenous peoples.
The Spanish began a colonial period that lasted three centuries.
Since the founding of Asuncion in 1537, Paraguay has managed to retain much of its own character and identity.
Argentina is known for having one of the best teams and polo players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year will be held in December at the polo fields in Las Cañitas.
You can watch minor tournaments and games all year round.
Tournament news and information on buying tickets for polo matches can be found at Asociación Argentina de Polo.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Pound (FKP) and its value is set at parity with the value of the British Pound (GBP).
Cash can be exchanged at the only bank in the islands, located in Stanley opposite FIC West.
British pounds are accepted on virtually all islands, and Stanley is mostly credit-card and U.S. dollar accepted.
On the outer islands, credit cards are unlikely to be accepted, but British and American currency may be accepted; ask the owners in advance what payment methods are acceptable.
It is almost impossible to exchange the Falklands currency outside the islands, so exchange the cash before leaving.
Because Montevideo is south of the equator, it is summer in the northern hemisphere and winter in the southern hemisphere.
Montevideo lies in the subtropical belt; summer temperatures often exceed +30 °C.
Winter can be deceptively cold: temperatures rarely drop below freezing, but a combination of wind and humidity make it appear colder than the thermometer indicates.
There are no special "rainy" and "dry" seasons: the amount of rainfall is almost the same throughout the year.
Although many animals in the park are accustomed to the presence of humans, wild animals are still wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to the park administration, keep at least 100 yards/meters away from bears and wolves and 25 yards/meters away from all other wildlife.
Buffalo, Canadian deer, elk, bear, and the domestic cat, all large animals can attack, no matter how tame they may appear.
Every year, dozens of visitors are harmed by not keeping a proper distance, and these animals are big, wild and potentially dangerous, so leave them alone.
Also, be aware that scents attract bears and other wild animals, so avoid carrying or cooking strong-smelling food and keep the camp clean.
Apia, the capital of Samoa, is located on the island of Upolu, and has a population of just under 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The harbor was the scene of a notorious naval skirmish in 1889, when seven ships from Germany, the United States, and Britain refused to leave the harbor.
All ships were sunk, except one British cruiser, and nearly 200 American and German lives were lost.
During the struggle for independence organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful meeting in the city ended with the assassination of the supreme Tupue chief, Tamasese Lealofi III.
Because Auckland is spread over two harbours, there are many beaches, the most popular being in three areas.
The North Shore beaches (in the North Harbour district) are located along the Pacific Ocean, stretching from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
The beaches are mostly sandy and safe for swimming, and are usually planted with New Zealand Christmas trees pohutukawa, which provide shade.
The Tamaki Drive waterfront is located in the Waitemata Harbour, in the prestigious suburb of Mission Bay and St Helier's in central Auckland.
These are family beaches, sometimes crowded, with a good supply of shops lining the shore.
The main local beer is 'Number One', which is not complex but pleasant and refreshing beer.
You can enjoy a variety of French wines, but New Zealand and Australian wines will probably make the trip more enjoyable.
The tap water there is safe to drink, but it's not hard to find bottled water if you're afraid.
Australians perceive "coffee with milk" as foreign, "espresso" as a short black coffee, "cappuccino" as a large amount of cream (not whipped cream), and tea as a non-dairy drink.
The hot chocolate is up to Belgian standards, and the fruit juices are expensive, but they're excellent.
Many hikers visit the reef year-round, and injuries from any of these causes are rare.
Nevertheless, follow the instructions of the authorities, observe all signs, and pay attention to safety warnings.
The sea wasps come to the beaches and estuaries from October to April, north of 1770, and occasionally they can be seen outside this time frame.
Sharks are present, but they rarely attack humans, and most sharks are afraid of humans and swim away.
Although the sea crocodiles do not live in the ocean, their original habitat is in the estuary north of Rockhampton.
By making a reservation in advance, a traveler ensures that he will have a place to sleep when he reaches his chosen destination.
Travel agents often have contracts with specific hotels, but you can also book other forms of accommodation, such as camping, through a travel agent.
Travel agents usually offer packages that include breakfast, transportation to/from the airport and even air-hotel bundles.
They may also hold your reservation if you need to consider the offer or obtain additional documents for your final destination (e.g. a visa).
However, any adjustments and wishes must first be communicated to the travel agent and not directly to the hotel.
At some festivals, the vast majority of music festival visitors choose to camp on site, and most visitors consider this to be a key part of the experience.
If you want to be in the center of the action, you have to get there early to get a camping spot near the music.
While the music may be quieting on the main stages, it is important to note that some festival venues may still have music late at night.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with young children.
If you're crossing the northern Baltic Sea in winter, look for the cabin, as the sound of the ice breaking through is quite a chilling experience for the most sensitive.
Cruises from Saint Petersburg include a stop in the city.
Gambling establishments usually make a great effort to get their guests to spend as much time and money as possible.
Their offerings usually include food, drink, and entertainment points that keep visitors entertained and with them as long as possible.
In some locations, alcoholic beverages are included in the price, but alcoholism affects judgment, and good gamblers know the importance of staying sober.
Anyone driving at high altitudes or over mountain passes must take into account the possibility of snow, ice, or temperatures below freezing.
On icy and snowy roads, the grip is poor and you cannot drive as if you were on bare asphalt.
During blizzards, enough snow can fall in a very short time to keep you trapped.
Visibility may also be limited by snow or wind-carried snow, or by condensation or ice on vehicle windows.
On the other hand, ice and snow conditions are common in many countries, and traffic is mostly smooth throughout the year.
Safari is perhaps the biggest tourist attraction in Africa and a highlight for many visitors.
The term safari, in everyday usage, refers to a trip on land where one sees African wildlife, especially in the savannah.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, are often seen in close proximity to cars, and with standard equipment, they can be seen well.
Leopards, cheetahs, and leopards are sometimes shy, so they'll be easier to see with binoculars.
A walking safari (also called a "jungle walk", "hiking safari", or "hiking") is a hike that can last from a few hours to a few days.
The Paralympic Games will be held between 24 August and 5 September 2021. A few events have been held at other locations throughout Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to host the Summer Olympics twice, the first being in 1964.
If you booked flights and accommodation for 2020 before the reschedule, you may be in a difficult situation.
The cancellation rules vary, but most of the coronavirus cancellation rules from late March do not apply for July 2020, when the Olympic Games are due to take place.
Most tickets are expected to cost between 2,500 yen and 130,000 yen, while regular tickets will cost about 7,000 yen.
Lining wet clothes dries them out faster, and many hotels will lend you their ironing boards and ironing boards if they're not already in the room.
If you do not have a sander on hand or do not want to wear sanded socks, you can use a hairdryer if you have one.
Be careful not to overheat the item (which may shrink or even ossify it).
There are several methods of purifying water, some of which are more effective against certain hazards.
In some areas, boiling water for one minute is sufficient; in others, it is necessary to boil water for several minutes.
Filters vary in effectiveness, and if you have concerns, buy bottled water from a trusted company.
Travellers may encounter animal pests unknown in their home regions.
Pests can spoil food, cause hypersensitivity or, in the worst case, cause allergic reactions, emit toxins or transmit infections.
Infectious diseases and dangerous animals that can injure or kill humans by force are not usually counted as pests.
Duty-free shopping is the possibility to buy goods exempt from tax and excise duty at certain places.
Travellers who go to countries with high taxes can sometimes save a considerable amount of money, especially on products such as alcoholic drinks and tobacco.
The section between Point Marion and Fairmont counties presents the most challenging driving conditions on the Buffalo  Pittsburgh highway, as it often crosses isolated forest terrain.
If you are not used to driving on rough roads, be careful, as steep, narrow paths and sharp corners are common.
The posted speed limits are noticeably lower than in the earlier and later sections, usually 35 to 40 mph (56 to 64 km/h), and strict adherence to the limits is even more important than otherwise.
Surprisingly, the mobile signal here is much stronger than on many other sections of the trail, such as the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German pastries are quite good, but in Bavaria they are quite rich and varied, similar to their southern neighbour Austria.
Fruit cakes are common, with cooked apples in the bun all year round, and cherries and plums are a summer treat.
Most German pastries also include almonds, hazelnuts, and other nuts, and the popular cakes usually go well with a cup of strong coffee.
If you want a pastry that's small but rich, try something that, depending on the region, is called a Berliner Doughnut, a Pancake, or a Doughnut.
Curry is a dish made with herbs and spices, combined with meat or vegetables.
The curry can be either "dry" or "mocker", depending on the amount of liquid.
In the interior of northern India and Pakistan, yoghurt is often used in curries; in southern India and some other coastal regions of that subcontinent, coconut milk is commonly used.
Indonesian food is a general term for a wide variety of local dishes found throughout the country, which offers as many as 17,000 islands.
However, the term without additional labels means mainly food originating from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Javanese cuisine, now spread throughout the archipelago, is characterized by a simple, spicy style of dishes, with the predominant flavors that Javanese people love being peanuts, chilis, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar) and various aromatic spices.
The struts support the rider's feet and hang on either side of the saddle.
They provide greater stability for the rider, but they can also present a safety problem, as the rider's feet can get caught in them.
If the rider's foot is caught in the stirrups, the rider's foot may be pulled by the horse in the event of a run-off.
First, most riders wear riding boots with heels and a smooth, rather narrow sole.
Further, some saddles, especially English ones, have safety buckles that allow the leather strut to fall off the saddle if the rider pulls it back during a fall.
The Cochamó Valley  the premier climbing destination in Chile with its diverse array of large granite rocks and cliffs, which they call the Yosemite of South America.
