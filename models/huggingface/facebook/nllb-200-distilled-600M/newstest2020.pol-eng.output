Father Joseph Witko: I saw Jesus in the white robe
He's a charismatic man.
The crowds are drawn to his mass of liberation and healing.
He was a dozen years old when things in his life began to go on inexplicably.
Today, through the Franciscan, others experience it.
The mass of the liberation and healing of the saints is attended by the crowds
Once, the parents of a 7-month-old baby came to him with a 7.5-millimeter hole in his heart.
It was supposed to be operated on.
Father Joseph Witko prayed for him.
The same day, the boy was taken to the hospital for surgery.
The doctors were amazed and said, "No surgery is necessary, the damage is only 1.5 mm".
My parents were crying from happiness.
After another prayer, the hole completely disappeared.
He began to experience the Creator's extraordinary spiritual activities as a teenager.
In his dreams, purgatory spirits came to him asking for help.
I was awakened at night and compelled to pray for the dead and those who died at that moment.
He also experienced the presence of an evil spirit.
And he had a vision of what happens to a man who commits mortal sin.
My body was beginning to change.
I lost my human traits and started to look like an animal, he says.
An invisible force carried him up, he couldn't get a voice out of himself.
He felt lost.
Then God pointed him to salvation.
"Sinking in the waters of the river symbolizing holy baptism, I was released and returned to human form... " he says.
He didn't tell anyone about his strange experiences.
He was a man of a mature vocation.
He was 16 when he joined the Franciscans.
He did more than preach about Jesus.
He wanted people to experience him alive.
Members of the Charismatic Community of Renewal in the Holy Spirit
Many people who are hoping to get rid of the disease are attending the healing mass Father Witko is celebrating.
However, the clergyman emphasizes that their primary goal is spiritual healing, not physical.
The first defeat of Kolping FRAC Jarosław
Today (September 26) afternoon, Kolping FRAC team paid tribute to the current Polish champion Bogoria Grodzisk Mazowiecki in the 3rd round of the LOTTO Superliga Table Tennis.
The Yaroslavans in the personal lineup they introduced to the Grozidzcany have a slim chance of winning with the League's sovereigns.
He's got a good showing at the Dart Bogoria fight.
The team still lacks a team leader, Chen Jingqi.
Perhaps with him in the composition of the Yaroslavans, they would reach the third in a row of triumphs in the new season.
The young Asian Qiyao Han is not yet old enough to win with the likes of the Greek Panagiotis Gionis or the Czech Pavel Sirucek.
Not even with one of the most promising Poles, Mark Badowsky.
The Hellada player was the biggest star of the match in the MOSiR hall at Sikorsky Street in Jaroslav.
Both in the fight against Qiyao Hanen and Kou Lei he was a class of his own.
After three games, Kolping FRAC led 2:1.
Kou Lei probably played Mark Badowsky, and Daniel Górak after the exciting five-hour fight of Pavl Siruck.
But then it got worse.
Gionis didn't give Lei a chance.
There was still hope of a two-point win, but Qiyao Han didn't meet Badowski.
There will be no additional senior studies.
Why? Why?
According to Rafał Trzaskowski, a free preventive testing program for seniors aged 70 and 80 was to be introduced in Warsaw.
However, the idea will not be implemented as it has not been approved by the Ministry of Health and its subsidiary Agency for the Protection of Medical Technology and Tariffs.
The Agency explained in justification that the target group was poorly selected.
The above actions may even lead to the detection of individual disease units, which may contribute to deepening the difficulty of accessing NFZ benefits and negatively affect the patient, causing anxiety and discomfort associated with a false positive test result, it is written.
The president of the capital doesn't understand the resort's decision.
The money is ours, we've got the money for it.
The government is just afraid that if people get tested, they'll go to the doctor later, which is absurd, because that's what it's about, which is to lead to a situation where prevention can be done faster.
And all the experts know that it helps in the health system, because it helps in the fast detection of diseases and in the reliable approach to health.
The government has a very strange position here, which I do not understand, said Rafał Trzaskowski.
"I can hardly imagine the skilled professionals saying, 'Let's not get tested, because there will be longer lines at the doctor's office, and if these specialists are advising the government, I'm not surprised that the health service is in this state,'" the politician added.
Palestine responds to Israel: We will break all agreements
Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas announced at a session of the UN General Assembly on Thursday that he would break any agreements with Israel if the country's future government tried to fulfill Benjamin Netanyahu's announcement of annexing the occupied Palestinian territories.
If the future government of Israel that will be formed comes forward to implement this plan, we will cancel all agreements signed (with Israel) and withdraw from all commitments made, he announced.
We will reject the whole plan completely and completely, Abbas threatened with pressure.
'It is our duty to defend all our rights by all means possible  It is not important what the consequences will be  if we are fully engaged in the application of international law and the fight against terrorism, declared the President of the Palestinian Authority, who had already made similar declarations in July.
Netanyahu, the former prime minister of Israel, was again given the task of forming a government after the September 17 election.
A week before the election, he announced that if he won, he would annex the Jordan Valley and would incorporate all Jewish settlements in the entire West Bank into Israel.
In the early 1990s, Israel and the Palestinians, led by Yasser Arafat, signed a series of peace agreements sponsored by the United States.
Abbas, 84, also pledged to hold a general election on Palestinian soil during the UN General Assembly session.
The last time was in 2006.
"On my return to the country, I will call local elections in the West Bank, Gaza and East Jerusalem and anyone who opposes them will be held accountable to God and the international community", the Palestinian president declared solemnly.
Abbas also defended the rights of Palestine, which is a permanent observer at the UN, to exercise the rights of the UN's full members and all its organs and institutions.
The Palestinian leader concluded his speech by calling on the international community to force Israel to comply with the UN's provisions.
Israeli Ambassador Danny Danon briefly responded to Abbas's speech, stating that the Palestinian leader would prefer to focus at the UN on the Palestinian Authority's efforts against Israel rather than fighting against calls for terrorism in the Autonomous Region under his leadership.
Danon, however, did not refer to Netanyahu's announcement of annexation of the occupied Palestinian territories, the agencies report.
Rescue workers want defibrillators in the neural points.
The history of the border crossing shows that an automatic AED defibrillator can save lives.
The Voivodeship Emergency Department in Przemysl wants these devices in the most nerve-wracking parts of the city.
For their actions, the officers received a congratulatory diploma from the Wojewoda Emergency Station in Przemysl.
The applicant Daniel Cyrnek, the senior applicant Grzegorz Bal and Commissioner Jacek Wójcik are officials of the Podkarpackie Customs Office in Prymysl.
On August 28, they were on duty at the Polish-Ukrainian border crossing in Medika.
A Chinese activist died in custody as a result of torture.
He wanted to exercise the rights guaranteed by the Constitution .
Cao Shuxia, the activist's wife, received a call from the Communist Party secretary from her home village on September 23 to inform her that her husband had just died in a military hospital in Hengyang.
He didn't reveal the cause of death.
In the morgue, Cao saw her husband's body being massacred, unrecognizable.
His eyes, ears, nose and mouth were all in blood, the woman says.
They wouldn't let me take my cell phone, and there were a lot of cops around who wouldn't let me get close to Wang.
The police pressed for her to sign a statement that her husband was seriously ill and died as a result of an accident.
PLN 105 million for video game companies from the National Research and Development Centre
Almost PLN 105 million of the funding will go to companies in the gaming industry that create innovative solutions.
The National Research and Development Centre announced the results of the third edition of GameINN on Friday.
Nearly 30 projects supported by NCBR included the development of a platform for the creation of field games based on an AR game engine that creates a real-world map with an application that allows users to transmit data; a test-training platform for verifying practical skills in the workplace and professional development using VR and AI technologies; an innovative simulation game for the management of real production processes using a novel gameplay model based on interaction with the virtual world using the real world using the concept of Industry 4.0  was submitted in a communication to NCBRAP in PAP Box.
The aim of the GameINN sectoral programme is to increase the competitiveness of the Polish video game manufacturers sector on the global market by 2023.
According to NCBR, the Polish video game sector is already growing at a rate of 10% per year.
According to government data, the value of the Polish video game market in 2016 was PLN 1,85 billion, while the forecast for 2019 is PLN 2,23 billion.
The specially prepared research agenda of GameINN and the already 300 million PLN of support for entrepreneurs under this sectoral programme represent a major impetus for the further dynamic growth of the Polish gamedevu, we read in the communication.
The video game industry is a perfect example of the effective use of the potential we have in Poland.
The government's incentives for entrepreneurs who invest in innovation, such as R&D incentives, skills development programmes, IP box and support programmes implemented by the NCBR, are driving innovation and enabling them to compete more effectively in a highly competitive market, said Deputy Prime Minister, Minister of Science and Higher Education Jarosław Gowin, quoted in the communication.
The head of the science department points out that the money for innovation not only goes to innovators in the form of project sub-funding but also stays in their pockets  from the R&D relief in 2018.
The amount of the deductions for R & D activities amounted to PLN 1.7 billion, which saved over PLN 300 million for the companies benefiting from this allowance.
This is the equivalent of the support provided by NCBR in the three editions of GameINN, the Deputy Prime Minister stresses.
NCBR Director Dr. Wojciech Kamieniecki recalls that in the previous two tenders, over PLN 211.2 million in total was allocated to 78 innovative projects.
The huge interest in the III competition and the diversity of applications show that the video game industry has the ideas and competencies to further develop and enhance its competitive advantage.
It is particularly pleasing that among the projects selected  as in previous editions  there are projects for solutions not only for entertainment but also for industry 4.0, he adds.
The third GameINN competition for up to PLN 20 million in funding was open to entrepreneurs, a consortium of entrepreneurs and a consortium of entrepreneurs with scientific units.
The NCBR received 87 applications for a total amount of around PLN 317 million.
The tendering budget at the time of the tender was PLN 100 million, but was increased to almost PLN 105 million for 27 projects.
The results of GameINN III are given in detail on ncbr.gov.pl.
The GameINN sectoral programme is implemented under the Intelligent Development Operational Programme.
NCBR launched the programme in 2016 in response to an initiative of entrepreneurs associated with the Polish Games Agreement, which includes companies such as CD Projekt, Techland, CI Games, Bloober Team and 11 bit studios.
Lamine Diaby-Fadiga has pleaded guilty to stealing Casper Dolberg's watch.
The incident happened on September 16th.
Dolberg, who flew from Ajax Amsterdam to Nice in late August, realized after training that his watch had disappeared from the dressing room.
Not just because it's worth 70,000 euros.
The angry Danish boy didn't show up for class the next day, explaining his stomach problems.
The case was a mystery from the beginning.
The players in the locker room have private safe houses and the club grounds are monitored.
According to AFP, Diaby-Fadiga finally confessed to the theft.
The 18-year-old has apologized to Dolberg and his teammates and coach Patrick Vieira.
He also promised Danish to pay him back for the watch.
Diaby-Fadiga is one of the most promising young footballers in France.
He arrived in Nice at the age of 13 to make his first team debut three years later.
He's played in seven games this season.
He recently signed a professional contract, but the club will probably dissolve him with immediate effect, according to the newspaper L'Equipe.
He's initiated disciplinary proceedings against his player for now.
Nice, at least officially, refuses to comment on the matter.
Make sure you wash your hands properly.
We all know that you have to wash them (e.g. after you come home or before you eat).
But not everyone knows that to actually get rid of germs, you have to do it properly.
This is especially important now that autumn infections are approaching.
It takes at least 30 to 40 seconds for washing to remove dangerous bacteria and viruses from our hands
Most of us wash them shorter!
Just warm water and regular soap  is not necessarily antibacterial (many doctors even recommend it).
When we wash, we do not only wipe the bottom and the top of the hand, but also: the fingertips (coupled or single)  wipe them with a rolling motion around the inside of the other hand, the space between the fingers (roll your hands, wiping your fingers around), the thumbs  each thumb we cover with the other hand and in this embrace we turn it a little to the right and left.
In an emergency (when you can't wash your hands), you should wipe your hands with a wet cloth and then use an antibacterial gel (in pharmacies, $5,500).
Do not touch the handles or doors with your washed hands after using a public toilet (recommendation of the Chief Sanitary Inspectorate).
Open them through a paper towel.
Iran's president says he has rejected a proposal to talk to the US, Donald Trump denies
Tehran did not engage in talks with the US side during the UN General Assembly in New York, despite the US offer to lift sanctions, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said on Friday.
US President Donald Trump has commented that it was the Iranian side that asked for the lifting of the restrictions, which he did not agree to.
According to Iranian President Hassan Rouhani, the Americans have proposed lifting all sanctions on Tehran in exchange for negotiating a new international agreement.
It would regulate both Iran's nuclear program and its ballistic missile program.
Rowhani: Iran will not hold talks under maximum pressure
The President of Iran has stated that he has not agreed to hold these talks because of the toxic atmosphere.
He said he had met with American diplomats because he had been pressured by France, Germany and the United Kingdom.
However, he stressed that Iran would not engage in talks under the atmosphere of maximum pressure.
"And even if we want to negotiate with the Americans in a 5+1 format, no one can predict the outcome", Rowhani said.
The day before, the Iranian leader had said he would not rule out talks with the US, and accused the European nuclear deal parties of supporting US sanctions on Iran.
He added that sanctions imposed on Iran after the US withdrawal from the nuclear deal were a precondition that did not allow for dialogue.
If we can get through this preliminary condition and if America can withstand the sanctions and the maximum pressure, then of course we can talk to America.
He added that he did not rule out meeting US President Donald Trump, even though he did not agree to such a conversation last week at the UN General Assembly.
Trump: Iran asked, I said no
Donald Trump tweeted that he was the one who rejected the Iranian request.
Iran wanted me to lift the sanctions on them so we could meet.
Of course I said no! The president of the United States tweeted.
The voltage with the nuclear agreement in the background
France, Germany and the United Kingdom are trying to defuse tensions between Washington and Tehran in order to somehow save the 2015 deal with Iran, which they were signatories to.
It decided that in return for lifting economic sanctions, Iran would abandon its nuclear weapons program and put the nuclear sector under the control of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).
Since the US withdrew from the agreement in May 2015, the remaining signatories have repeatedly confirmed their desire to keep the agreement in force.
So far, none of this has worked.
Washington is using tactics to exert maximum pressure on Iran, and sanctions include a full embargo on Iranian oil.
Tehran has announced that if it does not receive a raw material export permit, it will limit its commitments under the agreement every 60 days.

The judge of the Vojvodina Administrative Court in Warsaw and the husband of the heiter Emilia, who, according to her words and screenshots on WhatsApp, participated in the stalking of the judges, was returned to judgment by the NSA on Wednesday.
The reason: no disciplinary proceedings have been initiated against him and there is therefore no basis to support WSA President Wojciech Mazura's order to dismiss him.
Judge Jerzy Chromicki, a disciplinary spokesman for the NSA, opened an investigation against Schmidt in late August, but it has not yet turned into a lawsuit against him.
Although the NSA, which acts as a disciplinary court in such cases, must deal with the WSA president's decision within a month of its release.
In this situation, the judge who publicly told his wife about her mental health problems in order to discredit her, who was removed from the KRS office on suspicion of participation in a heiter group, will return to the verdict and will issue judgments on behalf of the Republic of Poland.
Judge Smytt denies any involvement in the Hayter group.
He claims there's no evidence of this other than the fake screens and the words of his wife, whom he's divorcing.
The same thing is being said by the other judges of the Kastast: they're all innocent, there's no evidence.
And they're quite likely to bet on their own.
Because the DA's office has not been able to secure the evidence from their electronic media, and they're not even talking about the contents of the phone of Emily Schmidt, who was detained in June on another case.
Police did not shake hands to secure the devices of the people he identified as pursuers in a February report by Judge Waldemar Żurek.
There's no evidence. There's no case of Schmidt, there's no case of Kasty.
There's also no case of Nik boss Marian Banas renting a stove to the sutters and hiding income.
The CBA is checking his financial statements.
And he'll check when he does.
The Parliamentary Ethics Committee will not take care of Banas because the Sejm is suspended (but the State Control Committee has somehow come together to make a curious decision to dismiss Banas's deputies and appoint him as his deputy lawyer, although the law of such a strange combination does not provide).
It's like a movie, like an American novel, about a wife coming home and finding her husband and her lover in bed.
She's so amazed and upset, she can't even say a word.
She's standing at the door of the inn, and at the same time, the lover quickly jumps out of bed, dresses and leaves.
And my husband makes a bed.
When the wife gets her voice back and screams, "What's this?"
Who is this woman?
The husband asks quietly, "What kind of woman, honey?"
Only the case of Kasty and Banasia is a parody of the state.
And that's not funny at all.
MAINSTATION: Signature of the contract with the auditor-general for the financial statements for 2019, 2020 and 2021.
Maxipizza S.A. Management informs that on 27 September 2019 it signed an agreement with Premium Audit Company z o.o. with its registered office in Poznań, Czartoria 1/1, entered under number KRS 0000540136 in the Register of Entrepreneurs of the National Court Register maintained by the Poznań Regional Court  Novi Miej i Wilda in Poznań, VIII Economic Division of the National Court Register, entered in the list of entities authorised to examine the financial statements under number 3992.
The contract is subject to the examination of the financial statements of Maxipizza S.A. for the following financial years: a. from 1 January 2019 to 31 December 2019, b. from 1 January 2020 to 31 December 2020, c. from 1 January 2021 to 31 December 2021.
Camilla Litvinko in the final of the high jump
Earlier this season, the returning home runner, the 2017 World Championship bronze medalist from London, beat 1.85 and 1.89 in the first attempt and 1.92.
1.94 was only achieved in the third approach.
I'm glad to see you.
I showed I could fight because my first attempt was a complete failure.
I'll have to jump better technically in the final, Lićwinko admitted to Eurosport.
In the qualifiers, the American Vashti Cunningham and the Belarusian Karina Demidik were the best after 1.94.
Both competitors were the only ones who didn't fall any heights.
The women's high jump final is scheduled for Monday.
Starting at 7.30 pm Polish time.
Kornel Morawiecki is in a critical condition
He's been admitted to the hospital, and his doctors are calling him a serious one.
I'll add that he's conscious and conscious.
We believe that this will work out, that he will win another time.
We all pray for his recovery, an anonymous close friend of Kornel Morawiecki told reporters at the Super Express.
In the upcoming election, the prime minister's father is running for the Senate.
"I am still supported by my family and politicians", Kornel Morawiecki said in an interview with the Super Express two weeks ago.
In January, Super Express reported that 78-year-old Kornel Morawiecki had been admitted to the Military Hospital in Wrocław for examinations.
I had strange, disturbing symptoms and went to the hospital.
Turns out I have yellow fever.
But the worst was before me.
When I had a CT scan, I was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer..., the prime minister's father told me.
A few days later, in the MSWiA hospital in Warsaw, Kornel Morawiecki underwent a serious operation.
As Morawiecki said, President Andrzej Duda sent his personal chaplain, Father Zbigniew Kras, to the hospital.
The operation lasted about three hours and was successful.
I know a lot of people have prayed for me, and I'm very grateful.
I'm glad I don't have any more transplants.
I don't know if I'm going to get chemotherapy yet.
I'm putting myself in the hands of doctors who are more like good-natured.
For now, after this difficult surgery, I need to get back to some kind of usability.
I hope that everything will be all right, Kornel Morawiecki said in January in an interview with the European Commission.
"If I had given up too late, the situation would have been tragic and I would have said goodbye to this fall... " he added.
Krakow: 14-year-old girl is missing
Police officers from the Krakow City Police Command are looking for 14-year-old Nel Stoklos.
Anyone with any information about a missing person is requested to contact us.
The missing woman left her home on the evening of September 26th and has not returned or made contact with her family.
She was last seen on Old Guest Street in Krakow.
Nel Stoklos is 14 years old, 6'7", blonde hair and blue eyes.
Last time she was seen, she was wearing a blouse, gray pants and shoes.
Anyone with any information about a missing person is requested to contact the police at 12 61-52-911, 12 61-53-616 or 112, 997.
The power of the lead jump.
The title of the amateur sports event, held on Sunday afternoon, September 15 at the Oleandry Street Racecourse in Ołua, may be confusing to some.
True power is far from over, but that's what one horse race is called.
The power of jumping is the ability of a rider and horse to overcome ever higher obstacles, which in the most prestigious international competitions exceed even two meters.
It is worth adding that the long-standing and still unbroken world record, set back in 1949 by Chilean Albert Larraguibela, on the horse Huaso, is 247 cm.
No one has ever jumped this high in Olava, of course, but the best local Amazons at 135 cm are not the worst...
The races organized by the tireless Jan Sienkiewicz and other activists of the JKS W siodle, were a showpiece of the previously held races, which we write more about in this issue of the newspaper, on page 22.
Eight Amazons, riding in the Olav JKS, entered the competition.
Four were competing in the heels, and four in the big horses.
The first group was bested by Nikola Szołdra, riding a crazy Sprinter.
This small but dynamic ruler began by overcoming obstacles 40 centimeters high and ended at a station with a top beam 125 centimeters off the ground.
However, he did not give up easily and only after three consecutive rejections was he removed from further competition by the competition jury.
The second place in the leap was taken by Amelia Pawlak, who is riding the Famy, and the third by Lena Boruń on the Harmider.
The youngest contestant, Inga Aksman, fought ambitiously, galloping and jumping through obstacles on a small stick Carmen.
Even more excitement was felt by the Amazons and spectators at the big horse competition.
The most dangerously-looking falls included Paulina Szewczyk, who was sitting on the Declaration, and Anastasia Abramenko, who was riding the Lotce.
Fortunately, except for the minor bruises, neither the Amazons nor the horses were harmed, so they continued to compete.
A lot of problems with putting the young Wyneta on the parquet were with her newest member, Veronika Łuczkiewicz.
She needed either an assistant coach or another horse for a couple that she was chasing a little crazy Vineta.
After the obstacle was removed from the parking lot, she also drove full throttle, so for a while in the boxing and the sprinting room it became dangerous.
Since the start of the big horse competition, Marta Masalska has been doing great on the track, riding beautifully presenting Whisky.
This decent bat, coupled with an experienced Amazon, was the first to jump over 135 cm after the second approach in the final stage, and it was the best result of the competition at that time.
However, after a while, the same amount was also claimed by Paulina Szewczyk on the Declaration, by Weronik Łuczkiewicz on the Vinet and by Anastasia Abramenko on the Lot.
So after the flower decorations and the prize-giving of the equestrian equipment, all these contestants went together, and finally, together with the Amazons on the humps, they performed an impressive honor round, ending these exciting and interesting competitions.
Thank you .
The Riding Sports Club of Siodle would like to thank the sponsors of the power jump competition at the 16th Riding Championships: the Olava City Authority, the Olava Water and Sewerage Authority, the World Council and the company Mustang.
Max Kolonko is cutting off from the Patriot Revolution of Max Kolonko
The Patriotist Max Kolonko Revolution KWC is the name of the electoral committee under which Mariusz Max Kolonko's #R Revolution political formation was to go to the October parliamentary elections.
The revolution was directed especially at young right-wing voters.
Before the election, Kolonko announced cooperation with Mark Jakubiaki or Paul Kukiz, but none of these coalitions came to fruition, and the Patriotic Revolution of Max Kolonko KWK itself failed to even gather enough signatures to issue letters in any polling station in Poland.
Now Kolonko has announced on Twitter that he has ended his collaboration with the Max Kolonko Patriotic Revolution Foundation.
"I'll expect the W.A.C. to remove my name from the name.
He said that he would be happy to disassociate himself from the company. He added that he would be happy to give more information soon.
It is not known whether the journalist will continue his work or whether this is the end of the #RRevolution formation.
On July 4, the US Independence Day, US-based journalist Mariusz Max Kolonko announced the formation of a new political group - #R Revolution.
In recent years Kolonko has become famous for running the YouTube channel Max TV, where he comments on events in Poland and around the world.
We've had enough of politicians, enough of your stupid games, enough of your amateur governments.
It's time for the authorities in the country to embrace the people and rule for the good of the people, Kolonko said.
The party's agenda included issues such as the judiciary (the right to be elected in general elections), tax reforms (equalisation of the tax-free amount for all), war reparations (in the form of military aid to NATO's eastern flank countries, with particular regard to Poland), holding a referendum on gun ownership, limiting the number of MPs or introducing single-member constituencies.
A few days after the announcement of the formation of a new political group, Mariusz Max Kolonko began talks with Mark Jakubiaki.
In late July Kolonko posted on his social media profile information suggesting that #R would join forces with the Kukiz'15.
But none of these coalitions ever came to fruition.
UBS: Gold near equilibrium
The euro will remain around the PLN 4.35 threshold in the coming months, accompanied by a weak economic situation on global markets, says Michael Bolliger of UBS Wealth Management.
Expectations of maintaining a solid economic growth rate and a stable monetary policy are in favour of stabilizing gold prices at the current ceiling, an expert in an interview with Bankier.pl estimates.
He said that despite the clear inflationary pressure, the Monetary Policy Council would not decide to raise rates in an environment where the vast majority of central banks are relaxing policy.
 As long as gold is properly valued  the euro should remain quoted in the coming months around the PLN 4.35 threshold  he feels that Polish bonds are not as attractive.
The profitability of the newly-emerging bonds is much more favourable than that of Polish bonds, according to Michael Bolliger, head of asset allocation for the emerging markets at UBS Wealth Management.
According to the expert, the main threat to the Polish economy is the deterioration of the world economy.
"The global slowdown may deepen, but it should not lead to a severe recession, or at most to a slightly below-zero GDP momentum", says Michael Bolliger.
Investors should be wary of global actions that could be harmed by the lack of prospects for a US-China trade conflict and other geopolitical risk factors, including the impeachment of Donald Trump and Brexit.
Europe is expected to be the weakest among the stock markets, according to a recent letter to investors by UBS Wealth Management CEO Mark Haefele.
The euro area shares should behave worse than the US, as they are more vulnerable in the face of increased uncertainty around global trade and fears of a slowdown, the document says.
According to Michael Bolliger, after the stock market crash of the most secure countries pushed the yields of German 10-year-olds down to minus 0.74 percent, the fall in yields is still possible.
However, in the longer term, long-term and short-term only yields should not fall due to the easing of monetary policy by banks.
The Fed has the biggest interest rate cut field, which should lead to a weakening of the U.S. currency over the next few years.
The long-term equilibrium point for euro quotes is a USD 1.29 ceiling, which would mean a 19% strengthening potential of the common currency against the dollar.
We expect further reductions in the Fed's interest rates, which will result in a reduction in the global monetary policy disparities.
"The current account and budget deficits may not allow the dollar to stay strong in the long term", says Michael Bolliger.
The Bundeswehr is losing its weapons.
Confidential report from the German Ministry of Foreign Affairs
The Bundeswehra has recorded 39 guns, 39 parts of weapons and 19 445 ammunition missing since the beginning of 2014  according to a confidential report compiled by the Defence Ministry of the Federal Republic of Germany.
The press, which is part of the RedaktionsNetzwerk Deutschland (RND) media group, reported.
According to a document from the Parliamentary Secretary of State's Office in MON Peter Tauber (CDU), two weapons, one part of a weapon and 3,474 munitions have been recovered so far.
Among the military equipment still missing are, among others, six MG3 machine guns, 11 G3 automatic guns, four G36 automatic guns, six signal guns and two P8 pistols.
In addition, there are 30 loops missing for the MG3 machine guns.
The Left Party's vice-president, Martin Renner, expressed concern about the situation.
As she told RND journalists, the number of missing weapons and ammunition items is staggering.
Especially since the investigation has only found a shallow part of the lost equipment.
Martina Renner summarised the effects of these actions as a balance sheet.
The German Federal Prosecutor's Office also criticized the fact that the statement did not indicate whether there were any weapons found in the case against Lieutenant Franco A. In December 2017, the Federal Prosecutor's Office in Karlsruhe accused him of preparing a serious act of violence that threatens national security and violates the provisions of the law governing access to firearms.
The officer was accused of planning attacks on leading German politicians for far-right and racist motives.
His blacklist of targets, which fell into the hands of the prosecutor's office, included then-Justice Minister Heiko Maas of the SPD, Claudia Roth of the Green Party and Anetta Kahane, a human rights defender and founder of the Amadeu Antonio Stiftung in Berlin.
Franco entered the country illegally with four firearms, more than 1,000 rounds of ammunition and more than 50 explosives.
Crying kids on the plane.
How can we avoid them?
There's a solution.
Japan Airlines recently launched a feature designed for people who feel like they're having a nightmare when they're traveling with a crying baby.
The lines provide a website to check the arrangement of seats on the aircraft.
If the child is travelling under the age of two on the given link, the child's seat will appear in a specific seat reserved by the parent or guardian.
The person using the carrier's services can thus choose a place away from the place occupied by the child.
The BBC reports that the lines have already reported the inadequacies of this solution.
The child icon will not appear when the ticket has been booked by a third party or if the flight has been changed at the last minute.
As you might expect, the idea was shared by the Internet.
Some Twitter users point out that the problem of traveling with crying children can be solved by using noise-reducing headphones.
They're children, we used to be.
"We need to learn tolerance because soon we will need maps of seats for mouthbreathers, spit-breathers and drunkards", wrote user G Sundar.
Another Internet user noted that he was once bothered by crying children on the plane, but changed his mind when he became a parent.
There is also a lack of supporters of the Japan Airlines solution.
"Thank you for warning me of screaming children during the 13-hour journey", wrote Rahat Ahmed.
Majorca is counting losses after the bankruptcy of Thomas Cook's travel agency.
More than 25,000 foreign tourists will not be arriving in Mayorca for their holiday in October as a result of the bankruptcy announced Monday by Thomas Cook's travel agency.
As the representative of the autonomous government of the Balearic Islands Marc Pons said on Friday, among the 25,000 holidaymakers who will not be able to take their October holiday in Majorca are also those who will be travelling with companies indirectly linked to Thomas Cook, such as Neckermann.
Pons explained that 80% of the expected holidaymakers who had to give up their holiday in Majorca next month due to the bankruptcy of a British company were citizens of Germany and the Nordic countries.
However, as Pons says, as Thomas Cook did not direct tourists to the Balearic Islands in November-April, the losses to the local economy will be less.
It disclosed that the Balearic Government had already begun negotiations with international operators to enter the Mallorca market following the bankruptcy of the British operator.
According to the daily newspaper Diario de Mallorca, over 1,000 people will lose their jobs in October due to the tourism crisis in Majorca.
About 800 of them are fired employees at Thomas Cook's office in Palma.
The rest of us will lose our jobs, mostly in the hotel industry.
On Monday, with the bankruptcy filing by Thomas Cook, the owners of several Majorca hotels demanded that guests pay an extra overnight fee.
This situation has been experienced by dozens of tourists from Poland.
The Balearic Government estimates that as of Thursday, several dozen hotels in Majorca had ceased operations at least until the end of October following the bankruptcy of Thomas Cook and its partner companies.
The daily Diario de Ibiza on Friday indicated that most of the hotels operating in Ibiza that have partnered with the Thomas Cook Group are not planning to close their premises in the coming weeks.
The paper recalls that on this Balearic island, a British bankrupt cooperated with 42 hotels.
On Wednesday, the autonomous Balearic authorities announced that they would ask the Spanish government for 100 million euros in regional aid to cover losses caused by the bankruptcy of the travel agency Thomas Cook.
They revealed that the largest number of tourists affected in the archipelago, about 36,000 people, is in Majorca.
According to the Balearic Government, Thomas Cook owes local tourism companies, mainly hotel operators, around €5 million for the July/September 2019 contracts.
FIFA women's ranking.
Poland still in 29th place, the USA leading
The women's national football team of Poland is ranked 29th in the ranking of the International Football Federation (FIFA) published on Friday.
In the same position, the team of coach Milosz Stępiński was ranked in the previous July ranking.
Weak team matches.
How's October going?
The leaders were the Americans who recently defended the world title.
The Germans held second place, while the Dutch remained third.
The Poles are preparing for the ME qualification.
They were supposed to start with a game against the Czechs on September 3.
The day before the meeting, it was postponed by a year because of food poisoning.
In this situation, the Poles will open the qualifiers with a meeting with the Spanish on November 12 in Lublin.
The White and Red teams will play two matches on October 3 against Cyprus and five days later against Brazil.
The Polish competitors are represented by Spain, the Czech Republic, Azerbaijan and Moldova.
Group winners and the three best second-placed teams will advance directly to the final tournament.
The remaining six second-placed teams will play in the final three European Cup qualifiers.
The 16th place bid will be filled by the host of England.
The men's national team of Poland in the FIFA September rankings dropped from 20th to 22nd place.
Smog has crushed the government
The effects of the Clean Air programme are nothing, and the coal mines will be leaping like nothing this winter, we read on the front page of today's "City of Things".
So far, 82 000 applications for support for the Clean Air programme have been submitted, totalling PLN 2 billion, of which 48 000 have been positive.
The applications accepted amount to a total of more than PLN 915 million, reports Rz, citing data from the spokesman for the Minister of the Environment.
As the paper notes, the programme only pays back a portion of the costs incurred.
The results of the appallingly announced program are described by the newspaper as "modest".
The self-government officials quoted by the Russian Federation see the failures of Clean Air, among others, in excessive bureaucracy.
The programme should be much simpler: electronic notification, sending of invoices by post, possible sampling of implementation.
This would improve the situation, says Mayor of Lidzbarka Warmiński Jacek Wiśniowski.
Activists from the Polish Smoke Alarm Association note that in the first year of the operation, less than 1% of the target of 3 million hillbeds was achieved.
As Mr Rz points out, although the programme's budget is PLN 103 billion for 10 years, or PLN 10 billion per year, this amount is virtual.
The budget of the National Environmental and Water Economy Fund for this year has been allocated a sum of PLN 1.4 billion, we read.
Congress approves the F-35 for Poland
Now the price negotiations
The US Congress has approved the sale of 32 state-of-the-art F-35s to Poland.
"This is one of the last steps before the contract is signed, but it is not the end of our work", Mariusz Błaszczak tweeted.
"We will negotiate hard to get the most favorable price possible", the Polish minister added.
Agreement on the Polish F-35
The Polish Air Force has a target of 32 F-35 Lightning II fighters produced by Lockheed Martin.
In mid-September, the US State Department gave its consent to sell them to Poland.
The communication stressed that the investment would support national security and US foreign policy by improving the security of a NATO ally that is an important force for political stability in Europe.
According to the State Department, Poland is to pay $6.5 billion for the fighters.
But that's not the final price.
The State Department noted that the contract will also include the supply of spare parts and repair parts, training equipment, engineering, logistics and human resources services, and related elements of logistics support and programme and staff training.
Lockheed Martin F-35 fighter aircraft
The F-35 Lightning II, manufactured by Lockheed Martin, is a single-seat, single-engined, fifth-generation multi-role fighter.
The aircraft is capable of close support, bombing and typical fighter-aircraft missions.
Thanks to stealth technology, the fighter is undetectable by close-range radar.
The F-35 was recently purchased by Belgium under a $4.55 billion contract.
The Belgians want to replace the aging F-16.
Other US allies, including Finland, Switzerland and the United Arab Emirates, are also considering buying US fighter jets.
Barbie against stereotypes.
Other, of a thickness of less than 10 mm
Barbie has launched a series of gender-neutral dolls.
It's how he wants to fight stereotypes.
Barbie has launched a series of gender-neutral dolls.
In addition to Barbie's different skin colors, figures, and hairstyles, Mattel has introduced gender-neutral dolls.
The toys from the "Creatable World" series wear wigs.
So kids can decide whether to have their Barbie short or long hair.
Their wardrobe is made up of both pants and dresses.
In the blink of an eye, dolls can turn from girls to boys and vice versa.
They are also available in different skin colours and in different clothing.
The emphasis on the gender characteristics of the dolls was also abandoned. The dolls no longer had full mouths, long tails and thin tails, or, in the case of Ken, wide arms.
The company believes that children do not like their dolls to impose sexual norms, and some parents and feminists believe that sex-specific toys inhibit girls' ambitions and reinforce traditional stereotypes.
"The new dolls will make all children feel free", Mattel says.
The Barbie doll, which appeared on the market in 1959 in a swimsuit and high-heeled shoes, has been repeatedly criticized in the past for promoting "unhealthy female stereotypes" such as unnatural body proportions.
The company responded to the criticism and already introduced dolls with different skin colors and more rounded shapes.
There were also dolls in hijab.
Zandberg: a wheel or a club together can have a dozen MPs
Zandberg, asked on ZET radio how many candidates his party can get to the Sejm from the list of leftist groups (KW SLD from which the candidates for the Sejm SLD, Spring and Left Together start, starting with a common logo Lewica), replied that it depends on the committee's outcome.
I think the Left will do very well, because we feel people are hoping that the Left is not only right, but also strong, he said.
According to Zandberg, the left can have 60 to 80 MPs.
That could mean that the club or the wheel together will have a dozen MPs.
But it depends on the Poles and the Poles.
I'm not going to guess and tell you how it's gonna happen, he said.
Asked if Left Together would have a separate wheel, Zandberg replied, "We're agreed to be diverse, and we're not going to pretend that diversity doesn't exist.
I think the Poles rewarded this diversity because we showed that by being different, we could agree on a common program.
Asked if the biggest beneficiary of the joint launch is SLD leader Władimir Czarsztya, Zandberg replied that he thinks the biggest beneficiaries are the centre-left and left-wing voters.
He also said that the SLD would receive all the subsidies, but that the aim of the political party was to represent its constituents.
Zandberg has admitted that he will vote for himself in the Sejm elections.
He said he was wondering about the Senate election.
"The offer is diverse and there are candidates and candidates in this offer who are closer to my heart, but there are also those my heart is closer to", he said.
"I will say very honestly and clearly that if I were in Senate District 44, I would take my ballot and vote in another district", the politician said.
"I would not have tried to vote for Minister Kazimierz Uyazdowski (K.O. candidate - PAP) ", he added.
In this district outside Ujazdowski, the leader of the People's Republic of Poland Paweł Kasprzak and Marek Rudnicki from PiS are starting.
Dakar: West Africa's largest mosque opened
Tens of thousands of people from across Senegal gathered in the capital on Friday to inaugurate a massive mosque, considered the largest in West Africa.
Muslims were arriving by bus, car and on foot to the Bopp district, where a new mosque was built to house 30,000 worshippers.
The facility was built by the Mouride Brotherhood, a Sufi sect of Islam that dominates Senegal.
The construction of the mosque began 10 years ago on a wetland of six hectares, given by the government.
The name of the Massalikul Jinan Mosque (Paths to Paradise) comes from the title of a poem by Sheikh Ahmadou Bamba Mbacke, the 19th-century founder of the Brotherhood, venerated by followers as a saint.
The mosque is covered with carrary marble and has five minarets.
The tallest one is 78 meters.
The mosque inside can hold 15,000 worshippers, and the second can hold as many as the outside esplanade.
The richly decorated interior features a gilded dome, giant girandols, and handmade decorations by Moroccan workers.
Builders claim the mosque is the largest in West Africa, but the mosque is still unmatched by mosques in other regions.
In Morocco, the Hassan II mosque in Casablanca can hold 105,000 worshippers.
The mosque, which cost more than 30 million euros, was financed by private donations.
In addition to the land, the government has also financed lighting, sanitation and road construction worth €10.5 million.
Coach Smyla: Our problem is not Silesia, but ourselves
After eight straight games without a win, the Crowns will attempt to break into a Friday meeting with the top-flight side Silesia.
"Our problem is not the wrestling, but ourselves, we have to work on what we play", said the coach Mirosław Smyla.
The Crowns' last and so far only league win came in the first row, when they beat the Częstochowa Rakówki 1-0 at home.
They then recorded two draws and six defeats, and on Tuesday they lost 0-1 to Lubin's Zagreb in 1/32 of the Polish Cup final.
What gives me the most optimism is that in the final seconds of the cup game, the players were fighting for the goal, they wanted to take the field.
Their fall on the mural after the last whistle was not a breakdown, it was a fall of anger, because they were so close, Smyla said.
As he noted, Silesia has very strong wings, so he will be sensitive to the team's play in the side sectors of the pitch.
"We're aware of the quality of the opponent, but we're also looking at what we want to play", the coach added.
In the Friday match in the Crown, the over-pausing yellow card firebrand Ignjen Gnjatic will certainly not play, and there will also be no injured Jakob Żubrowski and Michael Gardawski in the squad.
But it's encouraging to see a few players who want to play in a bowl game.
"We have a headache, it seemed not to be there until recently, and now it is", Smylla said.
Crown defender Daniel Dziwniel stressed that Silesia will not be an easy rival to break the eight league matches without winning, while in the extra-class anyone can win with anyone.
We're a good team.
We may not have shown that on the field in the last few weeks, but there will come a time when we will win and we believe it will be on Friday, the footballer said.
After nine rounds of extra-class crown with five points, he's 15th.
Silesia has amassed 12 more and is in second place.
Friday's game in Kielce starts at 8:30.
These trees could disappear from Europe altogether.
42% of the tree species in Europe's forest are endangered, warns the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) in the European Red Book of Trees published on Friday.
The top of the lists are chestnuts and beans.
The IUCN, an organisation based in Gland, Switzerland, is publishing a list of endangered species of European trees for the first time.
It was compiled by experts who concluded that of the 454 tree species found in Europe (and elsewhere in the world), 42% are "highly endangered".
Among the reasons, the Red Book lists rapid urban growth and global climate change.
But the most threatened are the trees and shrubs that are found only or mainly on our continent.
As for the typical European tree habitat, according to IUCN, 58 percent of species are endangered, and 15 percent, or 66 species of trees and shrubs, are threatened with extinction.
The Red Book lists among the main causes of deforestation errors in logging, accelerated urbanization, excessive deforestation, and subsequent forest fires and changes in the European ecosystem.
The authors of the report also point out that many European species of shrubs, mosses and grasses are also at risk.
Human activities are leading to the gradual extinction of European plant species and are threatening the extinction of important and underrated species in Europe, which form the basis of European ecosystems and affect the health of our planet, concluded the Luc Bas report, which is the European bureau of the IUCN.
I can't promise you 600+
Today, PiS wants to bribe Poles by offering them a free distribution loan to pay off future generations, says Grzegorz Schetyna in an interview with "Rzeczpospolitej".
He said that the whole policy of PiS is to drink.
At the same time, the politician promises that what is given will not be taken away.
Schetyna assures him in a conversation with Jack Nizinkiewicz that he has an idea to defeat Law and Justice.
It's about mobilizing the electorate at the polls.
He believes that the opposition has more potential in this area than the Kaczynski Party.
"Today, there are more conscious people who want to live in a normal state than there are those who support PiS, a party that has broken its preached values of modesty, humility, transparency", says Schetyna.
The Leader of the Civic Coalition and the Chairman of the Civic Platform also outlined the basic principles of the electoral programme of the KO.
First, nothing that is data will be collected, but we must set a direction for the future, because PiS is only dealing with the here and now situation, there is no plan for Poland, which is evident even after dramatically low investments, he said.
Secondly, it is about the energy saving of Poles, helping and investing in those who work faithfully - and those who are entrepreneurs.
Schetyna explains that the KO program included a project that would give the least-earning Poles 614 PLN more per hand and more than a few hundred PLN for those earning .
The politician also said he didn't want to run for public office.
He said he'd do as much as he could, but he doesn't promise 600+.
'I will never allow a Greek version where the rulers bid against the opposition to broadcasting until the country's financial collapse finally came,' he stressed.
Schetina also stated in an interview with the Russian Federation that Jarosław Kaczyński and Mateusz Morawiecki are afraid to debate with him and Małgorzata Kidawa-Blonska.
"We would expose their hypocrisy and propaganda", he said.
Pride is the first step to fall.
Kaczynski is a man of state, as Banas is a crystal, he added.
The PO leader also said he had not yet decided whether to run for the platform.
Argentina: Six dead large condor
In the Argentine province of Santa Cruz, six dead large condor were found, TVN24 reports.
Experts believe that human activity contributed to their deaths.
The great condor was probably poisoned with a means of killing predators such as foxes, foxes, or wild dogs.
The animals could have eaten the toxic paddy.
Except for one young individual, the rest of the dead condors were adults.
This is a huge loss to the environment, because the chondros must live 10 to 15 years to become fertile and reproducible.
So we're losing a protected species, a threatened species, says Luis Jacome, director of the BioAndina Foundation, an Argentine environmental organization.
"I think the use of toxic spells and poisons puts not only this species at risk, but all other life forms, including human health", he adds.
They want a jewel for the president.
Work is underway to award the head of state a valuable chain.
The idea was supported by Andrzej Duda's law firm.
According to the newspaper, the gold chain of the Order of the White Eagle, the royal insignia officially called the jewel of the Commonwealth during the interwar period.
The last time he used it was probably President Ignacy Mosticki.
The RZ says that soon a chain like this could hit Andrei Dudy's shoulders.
The Senate Committee on Human Rights, the Rule of Law and the Petition on Wednesday voted on a motion to amend the Order and Distinguish Act to restore it.
The newspaper says this is not the first attempt to restore this chain to the head of state.
The Senate had already proposed such an amendment in 1992, but it was rejected unanimously.
This time, the work is quick.
In early August, the senators devoted a few minutes to this matter, recognizing that they would seek the President's Office's opinion.
This one came in mid-September.
"I would like to inform you that the Office of the President of the Republic of Poland does not comment on the position expressed in the petition", wrote the then Prime Minister, Andrej Dera.
On Wednesday, the Senate committee resumed the case and again devoted little time to the case.
The President's office has responded briefly: it is in favor of restoring it, said Robert Mamutov, the head of the commission, from PiS, quoted by the Russian media.
He submitted a proposal to start legislative work, which the committee supported.
The cops will teach the drivers how to drive across the intersection.
The police action will be conducted at the intersection of the streets of Tepliński and Piłsudski.
The uniforms are related to the city's recent complaints about drivers not always being able to behave properly at the intersection.
On Friday, 27 September, police will start a prevention operation in Rzeszow.
It's about eliminating traffic jams: getting to the intersection without being able to get off, not following the lights or road signs.
"We often think we're alone at the intersection, and we're actually making life difficult for other drivers", said Marek Ustrobiński, the city's vice president, a few days ago.
His words were echoed at a press conference at the city hall, where city officials presented examples of improper traffic at intersections, which resulted in traffic jams.
The president then called on travelers to exercise common sense on the road and to move faster on lights and not text while driving.
The subject has been taken up by the Nazi police, who are starting the "Traffic Crossing" campaign today.
What's the matter?
The aim of the measures is to eliminate the phenomenon of restricting traffic at intersections by drivers entering them without the possibility of continuing to drive.
It's a common offense that increases traffic jams and creates traffic jams.
She is threatened with a fine of PLN 300 and two criminal penalties.
In addition, the uniforms will be alerted to non-compliance with lighting or road signs and to improper parking in the intersection area.
They will also observe a lack of driving fluency, late movement under the signals, free crossing of the intersections and leaving too much distance between vehicles.
What intersections will the operations be conducted at?
M.in. on Lisa-Kuli street from Jagiellonian street; Ciepliński street from Piłsudski street; Targowa street from Piłsudski street; Sreenive Square from Dąbrowski street or Hetmanskie street from Warsaw's insurgents street.
This type of action will take place in the capital of the Carpathians on the following Friday in October.
They checked out a waste disposal company in Chechnya.
Officers of the Environmental Protection Department of the Wrocław County Municipality and the World Building Supervision Inspection Office checked on Friday the plant in the municipality of Zielonka, where waste from the wastewater treatment plant Czajka in Warsaw , the spokesman for the mayor of Wrocław Karol Szyszko informed.
The inspectors from the mayor of Wolomiński carried out a check at a plant in the forests belonging to the municipality of Zelonka.
The private trade and transport facility Dar-Trans, under a contract with the municipal waste treatment plant Czajka, carries out waste management services.
The inspection of the installation was completed, and the entrepreneur was also asked to provide documentation relating to his activities, Szyszko said.
He added that the post-control report would be forwarded to the Vojvodina Environmental Protection Inspectorate in Warsaw.
The last inspection in Dar-Transie was carried out by the Vojvodina Environmental Protection Inspectorate in Warsaw during the period 29 December 2015  11 February 2016.
It was found at the time that the company did not carry out sampling, measurement and testing of groundwater and did not have the results of studies of established municipal wastewater treatment plants from the Czajka wastewater treatment plant.
After the investigation, Darius Sobota was called upon to stop violating the terms of the decision.
The private DAR-TRANS DARUS Sobota Trade and Transport Plant is one of the companies that takes waste in the form of stabilized municipal wastewater from the Czajka  treatment plant.
According to the decision to dispose of waste at the site, waste of up to 60 000 tonnes per year is processed in the forests around the Greenland.
The Warsaw Municipal Water and Sewerage Company informed last Thursday that the plant was decommissioned at the end of November and December 2018, which was related to damage to one of the incineration plants.
The Commission also notes that the export price of the product concerned was not established in the Union market.
Lech Walesa supported the Małgorzata Kidawa-Blonska.
"You have undertaken a difficult task, you can count on my full support", Lech Walesa told the Kidawi-Blonski Margot on Friday.
Mr President, these are very important words for me, replied the candidate of the Civic Coalition for Prime Minister, leader of the KO list in Warsaw.
The former president stressed that as far as the situation in Poland is concerned, he is now only a retired fan.
On Friday, Ms. Kidawa-Blońska met with former President Lech Wałęsza in his office at the European Solidarity Centre in Gdańsk.
A short conversation behind closed doors was also attended by Wałęsa's son Jarosław.
"You've taken on a difficult task", he said after meeting Lech Walesa.
You can count on my full support, he added.
The problems facing Poland are familiar to us all.
Therefore, I hope that you as a woman can cope with these problems, and we all who love Poland will support your actions to the fullest, the former president said, addressing the Kyiv-Blonski.
Very important words
Kidawa-Blońska thanked you for your support.
Mr. President, these are very important words to me because no one like you can talk about freedom, the Constitution and know how important it is, she said.
Let's show that we can make different, wise policies together, but in accordance with the Constitution, in accordance with the law, in accordance with respect for others.
This is how you made your revolution, and this is how we want to change Poland, Kidawa-Błońska stressed.
Kibics in retirement
Walsa told reporters he's just a retired fan now.
Of course I'm looking at it.
I hope we can reverse the course of events, that what was good, proven, we can get back to.
The tripartite government is the most important thing, the constitution is the most important thing, the courts are the most necessary.
And we need to clear this up, we need to get it back to normal, and I believe we're going to do that this time.
Because if not, we're going to have a street standard, Lech Walesa said.
That is why it is so important that Poles go to the polls, think about it and make their own decisions.
And that's the most important thing, Kidawa-Blońska said.
"The last chance we have of making a card to improve the situation in Poland", replied the former president.
We must rebuild the foundation
Asked about the most important changes that should happen in Poland, Kidawa-Błońska said: "Mr. President said very well.
We need to rebuild the foundation on which we can do all the other things.
Since there is no such thing as a threefold division of power, since the Constitution is not respected, we must go back to the beginning and make it obvious and make it known to everyone that otherwise Poland will not go forward.
The Slovenes are 3-1 in the semi-final.
On a hot field in Lublin, Polish netball players faced the Slovenes in the semi-finals of the European Championship.
There was no shortage of controversy and discussion with the judges, with the Polish coach Vitał Heynen in the lead role.
The White and Red have lost 1-3, and they're playing for the bronze medal.
The Senate has passed key legislation
The Senate passed the law on disclosing the assets of the families of the most important civil servants and on the flights of the most important people in the state without amendment.
The amendment to the law on the family assets of public officials  without amendment  was voted on by 52 senators, 14 against, three abstained.
The Senators therefore voted to reject the 12 amendments introduced by Senator Slavomir Rybicki during Wednesday's debate.
According to him, the amendments were intended to 'civilize' and limit the scope of information on the financial situation of the declaration's own children, spouse's children, children adapted to cases where children are kept in the same household with the declarant.
The law on the confidentiality of the family assets of the most important civil servants, drafted by the Prime Minister's Office, was adopted by the Sejm on 11 September.
The rules provide that, inter alia, the Prime Ministers, Ministers, Members of Parliament, Members of Parliament, Senators, Presidents of the Constitutional Court, the Chief Administrative Court and the Supreme Court, as well as the heads of other public bodies, shall be required to include in the statement of assets information on the personal property of spouses, children and cohabiting persons.
The Senate has also failed to propose amendments to the state's most important people's flight bill.
It regulates which flights have HEAD status and who can board government aircraft with the most important people in the country.
The law also specifies who is responsible for maintaining the Central Flight Register.
The bill was passed without amendment by 55 senators, 12 against, and four abstained.
According to the law, every presidential flight will be an official mission flight.
The President will be accompanied by family members and other persons invited by the President.
The flight of the official mission of the Prime Minister and the Sejm and Senate Marshals will be only for the purpose of carrying out tasks directly related to the function.
The law also specifies the list of persons who can accompany the most important people in the country during the flight.
The rules state that delegations may be on board  invited Members of Parliament, senators, public authorities and experts; technical, medical or organisational service providers; and journalists.
According to the law, if there are any doubts about the flights of the Sejm and Senate marshals, the head of the KPRM will ask for their clarification.
If such doubts are not clarified within the time limit set, the Head of the CPRM shall be required to notify the Heads of the Sejm or Senate of the impossibility of organising such a flight.
New sports attorney
Waldemar Paluch has called his representative for physical culture, sport and tourism.
He was appointed Artur Świątek, long-time president of the University Club AZS PWSTE Jarosław, for the last 4 years director of the Office of the Rector of the Yaroslavl University.
Bartolomye Pacek Artur Świętek was recently heavily involved in the project of basketball revival in Yaroslavl.
Artur Świętek is not an anonymous figure in the Yugoslav sports community.
Graduated from the Academy of Physical Education in Biała Podlaska since 2002, he is an instructor at the State Technical and Economic Higher School in Yaroslavl, and has been serving as president for 15 years.
Poles after their first training in Paris, waiting for their last rival
The Polish national team held their first training on Friday in Paris, where they will compete for the bronze medal on Saturday.
Vital Heinen's successor closed the title race with a 3-3 defeat to the Slovenians in Lublin on Thursday.
There was talk of their trouble traveling to that fight.
This time, they were able to do without such problems. On Friday afternoon, they and the Slovenians chartered a trip to Paris, and a few hours later they trained in the famous Berca Hall.
According to reports from the class, the world champion coach was under-excited.
As Heineken's assistant Mikhail Mieszko Gogol pointed out, this time the main task was not just to practice the elements of the grid.
We went to the hall, but for the most part, it was time for the band.
I mean, we were gonna spend more time together than we were gonna train.
Talking, thinking about how to rebuild it as a team, he said.
He confirmed that the semifinal defeat was a painful lesson for both the players and the coaching staff.
We were brutally brought to earth.
We're obviously disappointed.
We always believed we'd be back for this game.
We discussed this game with each other at headquarters, the coach talked a lot with the players.
The two main reasons for failure are inefficiency in the attack and much worse than the usual handling of the situation balls.
The Slovenes were far better than we were in that regard, he analyzed.
He said the White and Red were not hindered by the stress of the performance against the co-hosts of the tournament, which was supported by a large and vocal audience.
He admitted that the world champions could have been put to sleep a little smoothly on the way to the semifinals.
Maybe if we had a similar style of defeat in the group stage, we would have reviewed the lesson sooner and then played the next round.
But only when he's done, he says.
Gogol hopes that the anger of the Poles' defeat on Thursday will turn into aggression in the bronze match.
I hope we show our true faces then.
There's a lot to fight about.
The last time we won the ME medal was in 2011, he recalled.
Paris is the fifth city, and France the third country to be visited by Poles during these championships.
In the group stage they competed in Rotterdam and Amsterdam, for the first two group stage meetings they went to Apeldoorn, and for the semi-finals they moved to Lublin.
Nick Kyrgios: severe punishment but suspended
The Australian tennis player was banned from the sport for 16 weeks and fined $25,000 for a six-month suspension for abusive words, gestures and actions during the last ATP tournaments.
ATP World Tour fans are losing patience with Kyrgios, but they still give him a chance to improve.
The most uncredited professional tennis player in recent years looks threatening. 16 weeks of rest plus a fine, but both penalties are suspended for six months.
Nick Kyrgios is only 24 years old, but he's been breaking a long time and has set a world tennis record. He's had to pay the highest single penalty in the history of the sport for violating the rules of conduct on and off the court.
Loud curses, strange gestures, unsportsmanlike behavior, insulting the referee and the audience, breaking two rockets during a losing game against Karen Chachanov, all after the ATP Masters 1000 tournament in Cincinnati in August, he paid $113,000.
He also didn't play for long at the 2019 US Open, but he did say publicly that ATP activists were corrupt, which hurt the organization's authorities so much that they launched a disciplinary investigation against Kyrgios and after a few weeks issued the said verdict of suspension and another fine.
However, the corruption charge was pardoned after he heard the accused and learned the context of the testimony.
In their justification, however, the tennis player claimed that the investigation showed that Kyrgios' conduct over the past 12 months in many cases raised serious concerns and constituted an almost continuous breach of the rules, that he constantly insulted in a vulgar way the persons involved in the tournaments and the spectators, hence a high penalty.
However, the ATP gave him five days to appeal and immediately postponed the sentence, ordering him to fulfil several conditions within the next six months: in the ATP Tour and ATP Challenge Tour Kyrgios can no longer in any way violate the code of conduct applicable to professional tennis players, in particular he can no longer curse, destroy rockets, argue with judges and the public, or any other way of behaving indecently and vulgarly.
He was also advised to seek ongoing support from mental trainers during tournaments and also consulted with people who specialize in solving the problems of athletes who are not behaving properly.
Nick Kyrgios' first comment on the verdict was, "Hey everybody, I can still play.
I just need to control my behavior, that's all.
In practice, the Australian will still have at least a two-week break, as his Laver Cup shoulder injury worsened and he had to withdraw from the next races in Beijing (September 30 - October 6) and Shanghai (October 6 - 13).
Kyrgios is 27th in the ATP rankings.
He won two tournaments this year in Washington and Acapulco, earned over $1.3 million, so even after the fines, he still has a lot left.
GUS: Life in Poland is getting better
The report on household budgets published by the GUS on Friday shows that up to 44% of households in the past year have assessed their material situation as good or rather good.
The percentage of households in the EU is estimated to be around EUR 30 million.
In the past, a total of 8,1% of households considered their material situation to be bad or rather bad, compared to 11,2% a year earlier and more than 20% in 2009.
The best material situation is in the households of self-employed persons.
In this group, over 70 percent of respondents consider it good or rather good.
At the second pole are renciest households, where the response rate was only 18 percent.
The number of children also has a significant impact on the subjective assessment of the material situation of households.
The worst is for single parents raising children, with 32 percent of them saying they are in good or better shape.
Among couples with children, this varies (depending on the number of children) from 55 to 60 percent, and among households without children, it is 48.8 percent.
The results of the 500+ programme are clearly visible in these statistics.
Before it was launched (in 2016), the worst material situation was assessed by single parents raising children and families with multiple children (with at least three children).
Improving subjective assessments of the material situation of Poles reflects rapid income growth, especially from work.
But that's not all, because the percentage of households who consider their situation to be good is growing faster than real incomes.
Moreover, at the level of the provinces, there is no clear correlation between the level of income and the assessment of the material conditions of households.
The best estimates are given by the residents of the Opolsk region, where 48.9 percent of the survey respondents consider their situation to be good or rather good.
The following are the provinces of Lubus (47.7%), Silesia (47.6%), Masovo (47.3%) and West-Pomora (47.1%).
In Opolsk, meanwhile, the regulatory income (i.e. after tax and contributions) was less than 94% of the national average and 98% of the national average in Lubusek.
The highest incomes were in Mazowiecki (120 percent of the national average) and Silesia (104 percent).
The average disposable income per person in Poland was PLN 1693 in 2018.
In real terms (after adjustment for the impact of price changes) it increased by 4,3% over 2017.
Compared to previous years, this is a pretty low score.
In 2016, per capita income increased by 7 percent and a year later by 6.3 percent.
While revenue growth slows down, it also slows down expenditure growth.
These per capita figures were PLN 1187 in the previous year, which means that in real terms they fell by 0.7%.
It's the first case of this kind since 2013.
The Commission therefore concludes that the Commission is not in a position to take any further measures to prevent the spread of the virus.
The study of household budgets suggests that statistical households currently spend 70,1% of their disposable income, while in 2014 this share exceeded 80% and by 2006 it exceeded 90%.

USA: Three suicide bombers among the airline crew
Three sailors committed suicide last week aboard the USS George H. W. Bush, the U.S. Navy reported.
In the last two years, a total of five crew members have died on this ship.
The previous suicide occurred in July of this year and the previous one in November 2017.
According to CNN, all three sailors shot themselves last week.
Each of these incidents occurred on land when the USS George H. W. Bush was docking off the coast of Virginia.
So far, third parties have been excluded from the case.
Besides, death is not supposed to be related.
We need everyone involved in making suggestions and ideas about how to prevent another suicide.
I want to emphasize that there is no stigma or other repercussions associated with seeking help", said Captain Sean Bailey, the ship's captain, on Facebook.
The Pope is not critical of the Pope.
John Paul II did nothing .
In an interview with Piotr Lekszycki, Stefan Niesiołowski stressed that in 1981 John Paul II was a huge authority for opposition activists.
"In fact, every sentence he made was accepted".
Later, some of his actions were criticized.
I think that John Paul II's failure to stop the harmful activity of the Pope is a great blow to his pontificate.
After all, this redemptorist, the perpetrator of the Church and Poland, has developed his media at its best during the life of the Polish pope, he explained.
A former PO politician admitted: "There were moments of discontent, the pope said something, he didn't accept Riddick once, but he had the power and for being a politician he could have simply expelled him from the Church or sent him on a mission to New Caledonia or Fiji to raise money for the poor.
However, John Paul II did not, as did his successors, Niesiołowski explained.
Then came the fatal case of paedophilia and the Church's activities, and indeed its lack of them.
I was a little ahead of myself, but I wanted to draw attention to the whole way he lived.
We've known about the scale of pedophilia in the Church since relatively recently.
The question arises as to how John Paul II, as head of the Church, could not have known about these abominable things, says a journalist in Niesiołowski.
In the view of the former Polish PO policy, the Church is an ally of the PiS.
It must be admitted that during the Solidarity period the Church was our most important ally.
All the festivities started with a holy mass, with crosses hanging everywhere.
Now these crosses are written, they've become a symbol of dictatorship, a symbol of the written regime.
I repeat: one of the biggest unpleasant surprises is that people like Rydzyk are shaking the Polish Church, that John Paul II did nothing about it and that today the Church is an ally of the PiS.
It's a black chapter of the Polish Church, which he'll have to pay a lot of money for, Niesiołowski convinced him.
"I hope Pope Francis will drive Jydraszewski, Rydzik and a few others like him out", he said.
Tomorrow is the county's 590th anniversary.
There's a concert gala and a bidding process.
The anniversary gala will be held at the Hrubizov House of Culture.
First at 10 o'clock in the church of St. Nicholas, Mass begins.
The official opening ceremony will be at 11:30 at HDK.
The Hrubizovsky Land Song and Dance Band will perform.
A young man from I LO named Stanisław Staszica will present a show called Powiat grubieszowski: Hence my family  live here.
The medal will be awarded to the Grubiezow County.
At 16:00 the event will be moved to the city hall, where the concerts of the "Hrubieszów" charity for Angelika Zinikiewicz will be held.
The disco polo bands will be playing NoLimit, Malibu, Energy Girls and the night star Mig.
There will be auctions, including feathers and porcelain for the President of the Council of Ministers.
PZPN is fined for burning at the stadiums.
Disqualified graph
The Polish Cup match between Gryf Wejherowo and Lechia Gdańsk did not end tragically when the Wejherow fans fired a raccoon that passed the goalkeeper of the opposing team, Zlatan Alomerović, by millimeters.
After the incident, the game was suspended for 20 minutes.
The PZPN investigation commission has sentenced Griff to a severe penalty, excluding him from future games.
The club will not be able to compete in the Polish Cup in the 2020/2021 season.
Plus, fans won't be allowed in their own stadium for the next game.
They won't be able to go out in groups for the league games until December 31.
The burds at the Widzew Łódź stadium also provoked fans of Silesia Wrocław.
However, the PZPN ruling was more mild here, because Silesia warned that similar events could happen and was sensitive to the relevant authorities in this matter.
Nevertheless, the services allowed the racing of the fanboat sector, the lighting of chairs and the enforcement of the host sector.
The match was suspended for eight minutes, and the police intervening had to use a water cannon.
PZPN has punished Silesia with a one-off ban on the stadium in the next match in the Polish Cup and banned the organization of trips to the matches in this and the next edition of the PP.
The ban also covers the Extra Classes league matches, but it will last until December 31.
Names of foreign cities on road signs also in Polish
The GDDKiA plans to exchange the labelling across the managed road network by the end of 2020.
The GDDKiA of the Rzes
In the Podkarpaty, the implementation of the amendment of the Ministry of Infrastructure regulation on, inter alia, the registration of foreign city names on road signs also in Polish has begun.
For example, the "Liv" will appear next to the "Liv".
In our province, changes will be made to 94 road signs on the A4 motorway and national roads: DK19, DK94.
We hear it's supposed to be easier, more legible and simpler.
The new guidelines are based on the amendment of the Minister for Infrastructure's Regulation on specific technical conditions for road signs and signals and road safety devices.
It should be remembered that the names of the neighbouring countries often have a Polish sound.
Thanks to the changes we've made to the law, they'll finally be on the road signs along our roads.
The introduction of the new marking begins with the subcarpact section of the A4 motorway, the Minister of Infrastructure Andrzej Adamczyk informed.
In Podkarpat, changes will be made to 94 road signs on the A4 motorway and national roads: DK19, DK94.
Total cost of the investment?
I'm not going to tell you.
The new labelling will first be implemented on the A4 motorway, which is planned for 1 November 2019.
What's the idea to do?
It's going to be a no-swap board, like a stick.
They will replace the current functioning names of the towns with new ones written in Polish on existing signs.
Both names will be written in one line  first in Polish, then in the original, in parentheses.
This will be a great help for those who do not know the spelling of the names of foreign cities in the language of the country where they are located.

Someone shot the swan from the windmill.
In a pond in Zameczka, Lower Silesia, residents noticed a swan with wings problems.
After the hunt and a visit to the vet, it turned out that someone had made a target out of the animal.
He received information about the injured bird from the villagers at the New Salt Wildlife Rehabilitation Centre.
The report said the animal had broken wings.
We're going to our seats.
It was clear that something was very wrong with him.
We acted quickly and precisely to avoid harming him and putting him under additional stress.
The swan was caught and taken to the vet.
The first RTG photo showed that someone had made it into a gun shield.
His body was fractured with scrotum, says Marcin Walasek, president of Malpol, a company that runs a rehabilitation center.
He's going to be in the center.
The wounds were cleaned, the bird was given antibiotics, access to water, a safe place in the center where it will spend the entire winter.
We're trying to reinforce it.
He can't fly yet.
Releasing him now would mean he would most likely not survive the winter, Walasek adds.
After the staff has submitted to the rehabilitation lab, they plan to release him to the same pond in the spring.
The authorities of Żukowice municipality intend to inform the prosecutor's office of the cause of the animal's poor health.

Gowin: We must stimulate the Polish small trade
"The effective taxation of hypermarkets does not solve the problem of retail trade, we will have to consider whether the state has any instruments to stimulate Polish trade", said the Deputy Prime Minister, Minister of Science and Higher Education, Jarosław Gowin, the leader of the agreement.
Gowin, speaking in the "Signals of the Day" on the radio station, stated that trade is dominated by international networks that impose such low margins on Polish producers that Polish companies cannot actually grow.
Noting that this is a very difficult problem to tackle, the Deputy Prime Minister recalled that the PiS government had tried to tackle this at the beginning of its term of office, but had received a counter from the Commission.
"We won in court and I hope that if the United Right wins the next election and forms a government, we will get back to that", he said.
He also pointed out that effective taxation of hypermarkets does not solve the Polish problem of small business.
"We will also have to consider whether the government, the state has any instruments to stimulate Polish trade", Gowin said.
In May, the EU court found that the European Commission had made a mistake in finding that the Polish retail tax was an unauthorised public aid.
The Act on retail sales tax provided for the introduction of two rates of trade tax: 0,8% of revenue between PLN 17 million and PLN 170 million per month and 1,4% of revenue above PLN 170 million per month.
The tax was to be effective from September 2016.
The Commission initiated proceedings in September 2016 for infringement of Union law by Poland.
Brussels argued at the time that the tax structure could favour smaller shops, which could be considered as public aid.
It further found that the tax was implemented in a manner that was unlawful.
It also ordered the suspension of the tax until the examination of the tax by the Brussels authorities is completed.
Poland did not agree to this position, but the tax collection was suspended.
The May decision of the EU court paved the way for a tax reintroduction, but it did not end the case.
On 24 July the Commission lodged an appeal with the Court of Justice.
On Thursday, the EU's press service told PAP that the case is currently in a written stage, in which both the European Commission and the Polish government present their arguments in writing.
It is not yet known whether or when the oral procedure, or hearing of the parties and any trial, will begin.
It takes a good few to a few months from the appeal to the verdict.
'This procedure takes an average of one year', said a source at the Luxembourg Court of Justice.
How to dress a baby for baptism?
We're going to give you some practical solutions.
Baptism is a very important event in the life of a baby and his parents.
It is often the first occasion when the whole family gathers around a child to celebrate his coming into the world.
No wonder, then, that newly-baked mom and dad want their comfort to look their best on that day.
Before you make a final decision about your child's outfit, consider whether it will be comfortable.
In fact, there are many clothing suits in stores that do not provide the child with proper comfort.
So what should we pay attention to?
The basic criterion for choosing baptism clothes is the age of the child
Until recently, babies who were only a few weeks old were baptized, arranged in white sets and placed in the same beds or large cushions.
Today, children who attend the sacrament are often older - months old, year old, or even older.
It's easy to imagine that such a great consolation needs a little more christening clothes.
So if your child is 34 months old on the day of his baptism, he will likely spend the ceremony in a wheelchair or in the arms of his parents or baptized relatives.
The best way to do this is to make it into comfortable cotton dresses or suits.
Although this item of clothing is considered a part of everyday wear, you can look for its refined variations, such as a waistcoat or a crown.
The boy's perfect for a score with a print of musk and a piece of cloth.
For older children, you can afford to have more imagination in the dress.
The girl will look beautiful in a simple, sash dress.
Many parents of girls look forward to a richly decorated, lavish christening dress with a suit of coats, bandages, and hats.
Unfortunately, a large number of manufacturers use artificial, non-breathing materials for their products, which are simply uncomfortable for children.
If you're looking for a suitable outfit, you'd better check out Asanti for Kids, which offers elegant cotton-coated dresses.
The delicate, cloth-like skirts, satin dresses, skirts, apps, and cute suits will make your daughter look beautiful and feel comfortable.
The perfect outfit for a little gentleman: a cotton suit.
Until recently, boys' parents were in the habit of wearing costumes that were a copy of adult models.
Polyester trousers and trousers, stiff collars, and helmets often caused young stylists to express their dissatisfaction out loud.
Fortunately, today they've been washed out by comfortable cotton suits.
All you have to do is look at the Asanti for Kids kits, which are soft, sweatshirt underwear, and this blouse, which is a front-style jacket.
These dresses look incredibly bright, but they're not ashamed of the little boy's world-knowing movements.
Kristyna Pawłowicz has published a statement of assets
Kristyna Pawłowicz filed a statement of assets at the end of her term.
It turns out that the PiS party has raised 110 thousand PLN.
Let's recall that Pawłowicz announced her retirement from politics.
At the end of his term, he has a total of PLN 110,000.
According to the statement, she is receiving a monthly pension of PLN 4.7 thousand.
Pawłowicz has an apartment worth PLN 570,000 and a little smaller, which he rents, taking PLN 880 a month.
The Parliament also invests in industrial metals, valuing the investment at PLN 150 thousand.
Earlier, Jarosław Kaczyński also published a statement of assets.
Voting on a break in the talks at the Conservative Party conference
British MPs voted against a three-day break in the House of Commons during the Conservative Party's annual programme conference, which the government has asked for.
289 MEPs voted in favour, against 306.
The House of Commons does not normally hold party conferences, so that members do not have to resign from their participation in them or from parliamentary sessions.
However, the opposition parties felt that at such a crucial time as the last few weeks before the planned UK exit from the European Union on 31 October, Parliament should not interrupt its deliberations.
The government's request for a break was supported by 289 MPs, 306 against.
Two opposition parties have already convened
The absence of a break can be seen as political revenge on Prime Minister Boris Johnson for his decision to suspend parliament for five weeks (the decision was declared unlawful and unfounded by the Supreme Court on Tuesday) and for refusing to apologise for it after the judges' decision.
After the ruling, the House of Commons resumed its session on Wednesday, and the highlight of the day was Johnson's speech and the stormy debate that followed.
Johnson accused the opposition of blocking Brexit and avoiding early elections.
It's time to implement Brexit.
It must be implemented to respect the referendum result.
Brexit has to come so we can deal with a deal about our citizens' priorities, about health care, about the cost of living.
Brexit must be achieved so that we can unite this country, Johnson said.
The Conservative Party's conference is due to start in Manchester next Sunday and will run until Wednesday 2 October.
The two main opposition parties, the Labour Party and the Liberal Democrats, have already held their conferences.
One of the reasons Johnson gave for the long suspension of parliament was party conferences.
Media: Andrzej Duda blames Israel for the anti-Semitic attacks in Poland
President Andrzej Duda believes that the anti-Semitic attacks in Poland are a response to anti-Polish rhetoric by Israeli leaders, foreign media report.
The president's spokesman has strongly denied these reports.
"It's just not true", wrote Bladze Spychalski on Twitter.
Israeli media, including Haaretz and Jerusalem Post, citing Jewish Insider, report that Andrzej Duda, during a meeting with representatives of the Jewish diaspora at the Polish consulate in New York, stated that Israel was to blame for the recent anti-Semitic attacks in Poland.
The president said the rise of anti-Semitic attacks in Poland was a response to anti-Polish rhetoric by Israeli leaders.
He referred to Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz, who said in February that 'the Poles have sucked anti-Semitism into their mother's milk'.
Andrei Duda said he regretted that Israel did not apologize for the humiliating statements of its politicians.
He also mentioned the act of aggression against the Polish ambassador in Israel, Mark Magierowski.
In May, he was attacked by a gunman who was shouting, "Polish, Polish".
The quote is not only inaccurate.
It's just not true, he tweeted.
He stressed that Duda never claimed responsibility for the recent anti-Semitic attacks in Poland.
According to the Spychal portal, he invented it.
According to the JJI's interlocutors, there was also a dispute between Holocaust survivors, awarded the Commander's Cross of the Order of Merit of the Republic of Poland Edward Mosberg and Rabbi Shmuley Boteach.
Mosberg agreed with President Duda's words and said it was Israel's Jews like Israel Kac who were responsible for the rise of anti-Semitism.
According to Boteach's sources, he was supposed to interrupt Mosberg's speech.
Who is Banaś and what did he do?
The stones rented by the sutters led a journalist to discover negligence in Marianne Banas's estate statements.
We're summarizing another affair that shook the ruling camp.
The journalists of TVN Supervisor revealed that Marian Banaś, the president of the Supreme Control Chamber, had not written a statement about the property of a 400-meter stone building located on Krakow's Podgórz in recent years.
Moreover, his tenant was in the same place as the one who ran the sex business (or rented rooms by the hour).
The building itself was allegedly a loan repayment collateral from 2016.
Bertold Kittel pointed out the irregularities in the "Supervisors" programme.
The reporter revealed that the stone was rented from Banasia by people connected to the criminal world to use as a place for erotic gatherings.
The clients were supposed to be male prostitutes.
Banas's response to the accusations was vague and vague.
Interestingly, the stones rented by the sutters led a reporter to discover negligence in Banas's estate statements.
The stone itself was not clearly described and the income from its lease was to be diminished.
Mariano Banas and his wife's estate could be worth between PLN 6 million and PLN 8 million.
In total, the couple can boast of two houses, three apartments, savings[...], Money.pl reports.
And according to the analysis of the portal, the Banasia stone itself was already worth about 3 million PLN.
The Central Anti-Corruption Bureau is currently conducting a review of Mariana Banas's financial statements for the years 2015 to 2019.
Banaś has announced that he will suspend his work at NIK until it is completed.
The opposition is demanding an explanation.
We're not hearing from the CBA that it's expanding its investigation or speeding up the investigation into Marianne Banas's estate claims.
Therefore, we are forced to depose the state authorities and file a notification of the possibility of committing a crime [...]", said MP Mariusz Witczak.
If a normal Pole had priced his property so low, he would have had 10 checks, tax breaks and a carnival, he added.
He climbed high, he fell low.
Marian Banaś is the new president of the Supreme Control Chamber.
He was appointed to this position on 30 August 2019 for a term of six years.
His candidacy was announced by Law and Justice and voted by the politicians of that party.
Previously, Banaś was associated with NIK from 1992 to 2005, working at this institution as a collaborator of Lech Kaczynski.
During the first PiS governments (20052008) Banaś held the post of President of the Customs Service and also as Undersecretary of State at the Ministry of Finance.
He was appointed as the Head of Customs Service in 2015 and as the Head of the National Treasury Administration in 2017.
Banaš was Finance Minister in the government of Mateusz Morawiecki for three months.
Cooler Master is introducing a graphics card grip
And graphics cards can weigh a lot right now, and that naturally makes room for a category of products that would have been useless to look for on store shelves a decade ago.
This is the solution  grip for the ELV8 RGB graphics card  introduced by the Cooler Master.
The new graphics card grip model is not only a functional solution to keep the graphics card more secure without relying solely on the strength of the PCI-express slot.
The ELV8 RGB Master Cooler also has an additional decorative function.
"Commonwealth": Ignoring a police officer's order will be punished
According to the newspaper, a police officer's order to disregard a particular conduct is a new offense, punishable by fine, arrest or imprisonment.
The union police want this change.
The idea went to the Sejm Committee on Petitions.
The case is serious, because we read that more than half a million cases of criminal offences are brought to the Polish courts every year.
The Commonwealth has determined that a petition the Independent Association of Professional Policemen is writing to MPs to amend the offence code has a chance of success.
The authors of the petition propose a new wording of Article 54a of the Code of Crimes.
It should read: 'Anyone who fails to comply with the request or order of a public official issued within the limits and under the provisions of the law shall be subject to imprisonment, fine or imprisonment'.
Paragraph 3 of this provision provides for the same punishment for those who, by failing to comply with orders, prevent or impede the performance of a professional activity", the newspaper reports.
The sociologist Andrzej Kowalski told the Russian Federation that while he agrees with the main message of the proposal, he fears that if implemented, it could be used for political manifestations.
"In situations of freedom of demonstration this would be unfavourable and would, rather than alleviate the situation, even exacerbate it", he adds.
According to statistics provided by the newspaper, 86 percent of citizens have a positive assessment of police interventions in 2018 and that every month the service takes 1.5 million interventions in the city.
Buras is worried about Europe
My Topol's writing is in his blood.
His ancestors include editors, translators, writers.
His father, Josef Topol, was one of the most important post-war Czech playwrights, today listed in the same order as Václav Havl.
So from the beginning, Jaime was cursed with the talent he was trying to use.
Eight years later, he came back with a "Sensitive Man".
The heroes are Buras and Soňa and their two sons, who are not the typical Czech family.
They're traveling actors, traveling around Europe.
He's a Shakespeare lover and a thief, and she's a one-eyed translator who doesn't part with a bottle of wine.
One of the boys was born without sound, and the second time he stopped when he was an infant.
But it's not the heroes that matter most in this story.
They're all just a backdrop to a world where there's no room for artistic nomads anymore.
It's a world of a swollen province, a society of old, suspicious people and loose youth.
A sensitive man turns into an absurd playwright.
The narrative is a tale of the disciples, and the conversations of the heroes create the world.
The scene is a Europe full of fear for its future, but also of constant questions about the past.
Belgium: Brussels Airlines cancelled 105 flights due to the bankruptcy of Thomas Cook
Although Thomas Cook's UK travel agency is down, its Belgian subsidiary Neckermann is still in operation.
The company is in trouble.
The Commission has also taken into account the fact that the Commission has not yet established a specific airport operator.
Neckermann also laid off 75 employees.
All office trips that have been booked in Belgium will be cancelled, but early arrivals will be eligible for a refund.
The Gandav court also declared bankruptcy of three Belgian subsidiaries: Thomas Cook Belgium, Thomas Cook Retail and Thomas Cook Financial Services.
At present, about 12,000 Belgians are abroad on trips bought by Thomas Cook.
Another 40,000 people were supposed to leave the office by the end of the year.
On Monday, Thomas Cook Belgium spokeswoman Leen Segers said the company was now "fully operational" despite the bankruptcy of its British parent company, which caused concern among employees and customers.
The office was reassuring that customers who had bought tours in the building would go on vacation.
Thomas Cook, the world's oldest and largest travel agency, filed for bankruptcy on Sunday night.
The immediate cause of the bankruptcy was the collapse of last-chance talks with creditors and potential investors on Sunday.
The creditors demanded that, in addition to the £900 million bailout agreed in August, the company obtain an additional £200 million as collateral for the winter period, when travel agencies usually have lower turnover.
But the company's problems have grown over the years, resulting in debts of up to £1.6 billion.

I don't think Slovenia played fantastic.
We played very poorly.
This tournament is not over for us yet, said the captain of the Polish national team, Mikhail Kubiak, after defeating Slovenia 1:3 in the semi-finals of the European Championships.
Görlitz in Germany offers free accommodation for opinion
Free accommodation in exchange for an opinion... made such an extraordinary offer for the German guest Görlitz.
The measures are intended to help combat the gradual decline in the city's population.
Görlitz is the most easterly city in Germany.
The beautiful pastels of the old town attract 140,000 tourists a year.
But as the Guardian reports, the city is struggling with significant problems.
Görlitz has the lowest wages in Germany.
The city is also struggling with a steady decline in population.
After the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, most of them moved westward, resulting in a 25 percent decline in the city's population.
In 2013, it carried 54,000 people.
To combat depopulation, officials came up with the idea of offering free monthly accommodation in the city.
So far, 150 applications have been submitted to the program.
Two-thirds of them were made by people in big cities.
People from Hungary, the Czech Republic, the United States, and the United Kingdom also expressed interest.
"When we applied, we thought the programme was to convince people to move to Görlitz", said one of the project participants.
"Now we feel it doesn't matter if we stay here for four weeks or not", he added.
The city has 7,000 vacant homes, and the unemployment rate is three times higher than the national average.
Although the city authorities hope that some will move permanently, the main goal of the program is to get the feedback of the participants.
The information gathered from interviews and questionnaires is to help revive smaller German cities.
"We want to know more about what people need, and if they decide to move, what their motivation is", said Robert Knippschild, program manager.
Other cities have already experimented with ideas to attract new residents by offering them accommodation incentives.
The first was Detroit, which introduced a program to pay promising young professionals for living and working in the city for a year.
Today, such solutions are used in many places, from the Greek island of Antikythera to Candela in Italy to Tulsa, Oklahoma, in the United States.
