A 28-year-old chef was found dead in a shopping mall in San Francisco.
A 28-year-old chef who had just moved to San Francisco was found dead in the stairwell of a local shopping mall this week.
However, the victim's brother says he does not know of anyone who would have wanted to harm him, and says: "He finally got things going well".
The body found at the Westfield Mall on Wednesday morning has been identified as 28-year-old Frank Galicia of San Francisco, the San Francisco Coroner's Office said.
The San Francisco Police Department said the death was ruled a homicide and that an investigation is underway.
The victim's brother, Louis Galicia, told ABC's KGO in San Francisco that Frank, who had previously worked as a line cook in Boston, had landed his dream job as a line cook for the Sons & Daughters restaurant in San Francisco six months ago.
A representative from Sons & Daughters said they were "shocked and saddened" by his death.
'We have a small team that acts like a close family and he will be greatly missed,' said the representative.
We send our thoughts and condolences to Frank's family and friends during this time of grief.
Louis Galicia said that Frank had been staying at the hostel for a while, but that recently his business was finally going well.
"He found the apartment and started dating a girl", Louis Galicia told KGO.
Louis Galicia said he didn't know anyone who would want to hurt his younger brother.
He was a man of good will and a man of a big heart.
"His way of feeling connected to the family was to cook for us, to make dinner", said Louis Galicia.
He never wanted to be involved in any kind of controversy.
He was a brother who drifted with the current.
"In a world where so many things are wrong, she was a diamond in the rough, shining brighter every day", he said.
Anyone with information is asked to call the San Francisco Police Department's hotline at 415-575-4444.
Medical interns on strike: Requirements for new work-related measures
The representatives of the medical trainees have asked their union to approve the new work-related measures in their dispute over the new contract.
The British Medical Association (BMA) Junior Doctors Committee (JDC) is calling on the whole Council to support new work-related measures from the beginning of September.
The JDC says that the ministers have failed to address concerns about the agreement.
In July, medical trainees and students voted to reject the contract with the BMA.
58% of the members who voted rejected it.
In a letter to members posted on Twitter on Thursday evening, JDC Chair Ellen McCourt said the government had remained "totally silent" on the issues that she said led to the rejection of the deal.
He said: 'In this light, the JDC government has voted to reject the proposed new agreement entirely and to call for formal renegotiations on all your concerns.'
In response to the government's silence, the JDC board today formally requested a special meeting of the BMA board to authorize the gradual and expanding workflow program beginning in early September.
The controversy has led to trainee doctors participating in six strikes this year, including the first full-time work stoppage in the history of the NHS.
The head of the medical trainees at the BMA, Dr. Johann Malawana, resigned after the vote rejected the terms of the contract, which had been negotiated and recommended by the BMA.
He had told the BMA members in meetings before the 54,000 medical students and trainees voted that the agreement was good and should be approved.
After the vote, the Minister for Health, Jeremy Hunt, said that the agreement would be a prescription for doctors in England.
Russia and Turkey: an alliance of outsiders?
A gesture that ended in a crisis.
The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to shake hands and declare the eight-month battle of words and economic sanctions officially over.
But as Vladimir Putin greeted his Turkish counterpart in the gilded hall of the palace, I had the distinct impression that Ankara wanted this reconciliation more than that.
Yes, there was a handshake at the event.
But Putin's smile was a friendly one, and he didn't seem to be very warm, even by his own measured standards.
Recep Tayyip Erdogan, on the other hand, spoke continuously about his 'dear friend' Putin - five times, according to one report.
I got my bills mixed up.
He also vowed to return relations with Russia not just to a pre-crisis level, but to a better one.
The next day, the newspapers here described Erdogan as acting as if nothing bad had ever happened.
I think his enthusiasm was the opposite.
But the coolness that radiated from Putin showed that the Russian leader had not forgotten anything.
In fact, the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his opening speech: when Turkey shot down a Russian fighter plane on the Syrian border.
The reaction in Moscow at the time was furious.
Putin attacked, accusing Ankara of stabbing Moscow in the back.
The insult was worse when it came from a supposed friend.
Rebuilding real trust will be difficult, perhaps impossible.
The public opinion in Russia has also changed since November.
For months, the state-controlled media led a staggering, thorough assault against Ankara.
Suddenly it seemed that the Turks were to blame for everything.
Most serious were allegations by senior officials that Erdogan's own family has been profiting from the illegal oil trade in ISIS-controlled areas of Syria.
He's been very adamant about this.
But in St. Petersburg, the official message was that it was time to move on.
In the end, this meeting only happened because Putin got the apology he wanted from President Erdogan.
Russia has achieved some sort of victory.
The benefits of a hard-line ceasefire are clear.
First, Erdogan needs all the friends he can get after being nearly ousted from power in a failed coup last month.
The continuing terrorist attacks in Turkey have also clearly shaken him.
There is also a financial motive.
The economic sanctions against Russia have been severe, particularly the ban on charter flights, which normally carry several million Russian troops to the Turkish coast every year.
The numbers have dropped by almost 90 percent.
As for Russia, local tour operators and charter airlines will surely be relieved when flights finally resume.
They're hoping for a late-season rush to the Mediterranean.
And already this week, state TV has predicted cheaper fruits and vegetables after the import of agricultural products from Turkey is allowed again.
'You put the tourists there, the tomatoes back here,' as the Vedemosti newspaper report put it.
But the visit also had political value for Moscow.
There is anger in Ankara at the West over what is seen as a weak response to the attempted coup.
When you add to this long-standing resentment at the pace of the EU accession negotiations, Putin comes to the fore, eager to exploit the coolness and break Turkey's ties with the West.
The Russian leader was guaranteed to get points from Ankara, where he called after the revolutionary attempt to support the appointed authorities.
Of course, this is a message to Moscow, which has its own deep-seated fear of a change of power.
So this meeting in a palace by the sea, in a palace by the sea, allowed Russia and Turkey to present what one analyst described to me as a "foreign alliance": two countries that feel abandoned and mistreated by the West, joining forces.
But the two have major differences despite their public reconciliation.
The key problem is Syria, where Moscow has recently adapted itself to the role of peacemaker, but where Russia and Turkey are supporting opposing sides.
It may be significant that after almost three hours of preliminary discussions, the presidents told the press that they had not even discussed the matter.
The Turkish president deliberately avoided answering the question about their differences, while Putin chose to highlight them.
There is no clear consensus on where they can find common ground on Syria.
After months of open hostility, and given the possibility of a total disaster if a NATO member Turkey shot down a Russian fighter jet, it's surely better that the two leaders are at least back in the conversation.
Royal Bank of Scotland to disappear from non-Scottish customers
According to the bank's CEO, the RBS brand will be reduced to a back office role.
The Royal Bank of Scotland is disappearing from the non-Scottish customers.
Ross McEwan told BBC Scotland that the RBS brand was linked to the bank's international ambitions.
Since the bank almost collapsed eight years ago and had to be bailed out, it has abandoned these objectives.
The bank's strategists have used the RBS brand to protect other consumer finance brands during this time.
It was backed by millions of pounds spent on sponsorship of international sports, from Six Nations rugby to Wimbledon champion Andy Murray.
But now it's been seen as appropriate to allow more national brands to come to the fore.
The Royal Bank of Scotland is operating with Scottish customers, but it is not being restarted.
In England and Wales, all RBS references except for headquarters and listings are converted to NatWest.
The Ulster Bank brand is already in use by customers in Ireland and Northern Ireland.
There are other smaller private banking brands that are gaining visibility: Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond and Holt's Military Bank.
Mr McEwan was interviewed on a tour of customers and staff in Invernessshire.
He told BBC Scotland: "The RBS brand will become our investment brand and employer of our employees, because we will now become much more of a brand bank".
When the bank itself became a global brand, RBS became a global brand.
So I say we no longer have global goals, we have local goals.
Each of these brands represents something very different in their own communities, and our staff works with clients under these brands.
RBS has already stated that it will not continue to sponsor Six Nations and has raised the profile of various brands in its sports sponsorship.
'We now have to move towards a branded bank because basically (we have asked) how can we focus on making this a better bank for our customers?' said the CEO.
Three years ago, I would have been very cynical if we had said we were going to be a great bank for our customers and offer these brands.
But with the work that we've done focusing on the needs of the customer, not our own, I think you'll see a lot of change.
We can bring those brands back, so I think the time is right.
Frankie Dettori wins at Newmarket with Predilection and reaches 3,000 wins.
Dettori sprays champagne after a double win, which brings his total to 3,000 wins.
The champion jockey, Frankie Dettori, has secured his 3,000th British victory at Newmarket on Friday.
He reached the milestone of the evening with his second victory on the home track when he raced John Gosden's Predilection.
The 45-year-old Italian is the sixth jockey to reach this milestone in the sport of horse racing.
He is followed by Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Piggott, Pat Eddy and Willie Carson.
Three-time champion jockey Dettori, who previously won at Ghayyar, said: "This is special.
I'm very emotional because my family is here, too.
I'm very pleased that this happened in Newmarket, because this is where I started 30 years ago.
It's not a big event, it's not Royal Ascot, it's just a normal Friday night and 20,000 people.
I'm relieved and very humbled.
Dettori is gonna get a lot of applause when he brings Predilection back from the winner's circle.
Two riders have achieved this milestone in the endurance races - champion jockey Richard Johnson and retired 20-time champion Sir Anthony McCoy, who had a record-breaking career of over 4,300 wins.
Lester Piggot, nine-time winner of the Derby, 4493 wins.
Frankie is one of the best racehorses of the modern era, and it is no surprise that he has reached this milestone, which few have reached before him.
He's elegant and strong, but his tactical mind sets him apart from the rest of the weight room.
He's a great ambassador for the sport, and his enthusiasm and charisma have drawn fans to the sport for years.
I told Frankie a few weeks ago in Epsom that he would have been riding the winner's 6,000 if he wasn't just a weekend and big race jockey!
Seriously, Frankie's been riding winners in Great Britain for the better part of 30 years, which is great to see.
He's a lively person, which is good for British racing, but he's also an incredible jockey.
Frankie Dettori celebrated the milestone with a landing on a brand-new, high-flying saddle.
From flying retirements to flying landings, Frankie Dettori has been the face of British racing for two decades.
This has been a roller coaster.
A few big race wins, including his famous 'Magnificent Seven' win at Ascot in 1996, but he also survived a plane crash and a drug ban.
Three years ago, he had a rough start on his return after a six-month suspension, but he showed remarkable fortitude in challenging the doubters and returning in top form.
And he may continue for a long time - Dettori has previously said that he would like to continue racing until at least 50 years of age.
Russian President Vladimir Putin has fired his chief of staff Sergei Ivanov .
Russian President Vladimir Putin has unexpectedly fired his chief of staff Sergei Ivanov.
Ivanov has been part of Putin's inner circle for many years.
The 63-year-old has now been appointed as the EU's special representative for the environment and transport.
The Kremlin statement said that Putin had "ordered Ivanov to step down as head of the Russian presidential administration", but did not give a reason for this.
Ivanov's deputy director since 2012, Anton Vaino, has been named as his successor.
Vaino, 44, is a former diplomat.
Born in Tallinn, the capital of Estonia, in 2012, she graduated from the prestigious Moscow State Institute of International Relations (MGIMO) and worked at the Embassy in Tokyo.
Later, he headed the President's Protocol and Cabinet Staff, according to the Kremlin website (in Russian).
When he was appointed, he said to Putin, "Thank you for your confidence".
I believe that the most important task of the administration is to support your work as Head of State in drafting laws and managing the implementation of your instructions.
Putin told Russian TV on Friday that Ivanov had asked to be let go and recommended that Vaso be appointed in his place.
Are the smiles convincing?
This is a move that has confused Moscow.
Sergei Ivanov has long been one of Vladimir Putin's closest allies and, like Putin, served in the Soviet secret service, the KGB.
As Chief of Staff, he was one of the most powerful men in the country.
In a meeting with President Putin on state television, both men claimed that the chief of staff had stepped aside at his own request.
But despite the smiles on the cameras, few here are convinced - especially now, just before the parliamentary elections.
So this is just the aftermath of some kind of power struggle?
No one knows yet.
But the official claim that a man once touted as a potential presidential candidate suddenly wants to lead Russia's environmental policy has been met with real suspicion.
In comments to Putin, which were quoted on the Kremlin website, Ivanov said that it is not true that in early 2012 I asked you in a conversation to give me responsibility for four years for this very complex, one might even say laborious, task.
Well, I've been a squad leader for four years and eight months now.
Ivanov accepted the assignment in December 2011.
He previously served as Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.
He is a member of the Security Council of the Russian Federation and a former member of the KGB, as was Putin.
In the late 1990s, when Putin was the head of the FSB, the state security service that replaced the KGB, Ivanov was appointed his deputy.
When Putin came to power, he named Ivanov as one of the five people he trusted most.
Once it was thought that Ivanov could become Russian President Putin after the second term, because Putin's third term would be unconstitutional.
But the task was given to another close ally of Putin, Dmitry Medvedev.
Putin became prime minister before his return to the presidency only three and a half years later.
Criminal Minds star Thomas Gibson was fired after hitting a producer.
Gibson was involved in a physical altercation at the show's Los Angeles studio last month.
The producers of the series, ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios, announced his dismissal in a joint statement.
Gibson, who played Special Agent Aaron Hotchner, issued an apology Thursday before his dismissal was announced.
There were creative differences and arguments on the set.
"I regret that it happened", he said in his statement.
ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios said details of how Gibson's character would be removed from the series, which tells the story of a team of FBI agents, would be expected later.
The 54-year-old former Dharma & Greg star has been with the show since its first season in 2005.
"I love the Criminal Minds series, and I've given it my all for the last 12 years", Gibson said in a statement released Friday.
I was hoping to be with you till the end, but that's not possible now.
I just want to thank the writers, the producers, the actors, our incredible team, and most of all, the best fans a show can have.
The series' twelfth season is scheduled to begin on September 28.
Mystery fish ended up in the garden at Banff.
A man in Banff has asked for help identifying fish that have appeared in his garden.
Kevin Bain believes that 75 of these fish could be wind-blown fish left behind by the water cycle.
Mr. Bain, who lives 500 yards from the ocean, released footage of the apparition on Periscope, hoping that someone could shed some light on the appearance of the two-inch fish.
The Queensferry Crossing is now a scenic crossing point, stretching into Fife.
The £1.35bn project is now expected to be completed by May 2017
Engineers have linked the northern end of the Queensferry crossing with the mainland, which means that the bridge now extends into Fife.
It is the first of four locks between the "cantile towers" that are now being completed around each of the three pillars of the bridge.
The Fife section of the bridge is now 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 tonnes.
It has 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 sparsely paved roads.
The £1.35bn project is now expected to be completed by May 2017.
Secretary of the Treasury Keith Brown visited the site today and was among the first to walk from the land to the bridge.
He said: 'This is a historic and symbolic moment in the construction of the Queensferry crossing.
We witness all the really impressive engineering work on this project, which has used over 30 000 tonnes of concrete and steel to build this section of the bridge alone.
Despite the enormous size and weight of the bridge, the completion of the span between the land bridge and the bridge deck is a demanding operation, requiring the most precise measurements to match.
In total, almost 79% of the bridge deck is now in place and the final section of the deck is being poured into the concrete today at Rosyth, meaning that the whole deck is ready to be lifted onto the bridge.
Michael Martin, project manager for Fort Crossing Bridge Constructors, said: 'The first lock in any bridge project is always a major milestone.
In this fantastic project, this fence represents the pinnacle of construction technology.
After the last section of the roadway was installed and connected to the north-pillar roadway, we had to close the remaining section on the northern, inland, side.
This was done by dragging the northern corridor's dirt 700 millimeters southward.
This was a huge and at the same time very demanding operation.
The huge one, being 222 meters long, weighs about 6,000 tons and had to be pulled at about 3% of the angle of inclination.
The team worked on the measurement deviations, which were small, only a few millimeters in either direction.
Thank God everything went well.
Rescue at Moelfre Bay: Three men are  lucky to be alive
Three men are lucky to be alive after falling off their fishing boat off the coast of Anglesey.
The Moelfre RNLI lifeboat station raised the alarm at 1.20pm (BST) on Friday after the crew saw the incident unfolding in Moelfre Bay.
Three men were desperately trying to swim to safety as their boat continued on its own.
"We saw the boat circling closer to the men and imagined the worst", said Vince Jones, the skipper of the Moelfren lifeboat.
"Fortunately, by the time we got underway, a strong wind had blown it away from them", he added.
Two of the men were rescued by a local fishing boat, and a third, a 60-year-old man, was found exhausted, hanging from a ladder without a life jacket.
The men were taken to a coastal lifeboat and brought back to the lifeboat station.
Jones said, "These three men who were in the water are lucky to be alive and completely unharmed.
The boat's engine had a cutoff link, but it had somehow come off the person driving the boat when it went down.
Somebody took care of these guys today.
Pokémon Go is a respectable quest for health and happiness.
It's fascinating to see how the world is changing.
During the past decade, many have lamented that teenagers and children no longer go outside to play but rather spend their leisure time watching television.
Pokémon Go is about getting people to get off the couch and engage in some kind of activity.
Screen time was initially limited to television, then to video games, and now more recently to smartphones.
So it's great to see that technology and outdoor activity don't close each other out.
I am, of course, referring to the wild game called Pokémon Go, an application based on characters originally developed in the 1990s for video games (later animated series, cards and other spin-off products).
Like many pop-culture phenomena, its popularity had somewhat waned before the new game's release in the United States, Australia, and New Zealand in early July.
After that, the game's release in other countries was delayed, as the huge popularity overloaded the servers.
In just a day, Pokémon Go had more users than Tinder and almost as many as Twitter.
How does it work?
In the Nutshell, as explained, players use their smartphones to search for Pokémon, which are tracked by GPS and, once found, can be photographed (using the phone's grid search) or intercepted.
The generation that played the game when they were younger has joined the fray and jumped up from the couch to join the search.
In the United States, the game has led to a significant increase in the number of daily steps taken by the average person.
The Apple Watch app Cardiogram, which tracks 35,000 users, recently told the Washington Post that within two days of the game's release, the number of people who exercise 30 minutes a day jumped from 45 percent to 53 percent among users tracked by Cardiogram.
The company doesn't know who's playing Pokémon Go, they only see training levels.
The admonitions in many public health campaigns to "find 30", "get out of bed" and "be active every day" have not produced any results because most public health warnings are boring and are issued by people who look unhappy.
The importance of mobility cannot be underestimated.
Regular physical activity is associated with a lower risk of cancer and depression.
Exercise helps with weight control, high blood pressure, and diabetes, and the benefits are too numerous to list here.
The beauty of Pokémon Go is that it gets people to go out and do something they enjoy.
This covers the three pillars of health: exercise, fresh air and sunshine, and fun.
Some people even make new friends while hunting.
As usual, the disgruntled revelers will be looking for something to complain about.
Yeah, someone could walk right through the door.
So what?
There's been a breakthrough.
And while there were apps like Fitbit that could track activity, they didn't give you a reason to move the way this game did.
The appeal of novelty is lost and the use diminishes over time.
However, the success of Pokémon has led to other games that combine apps and virtual reality with real-world activity, helping many hunters to be more active, fit, and healthy.

Simone Biles won the gold medal in the women's gymnastics all-around.
Forget the pressure.
Forget about the publicity.
Simone Biles is immune to all that.
You're a little high-strung.
It's a floating bridge.
With a great perm.
Great all around.
And now, finally, the Olympic winner.
A 19-year-old American gymnast won the mixed doubles championship on Thursday, putting the gulf between herself and the rest of the world in the spotlight of the Olympics.
His overall points total of 62,198 were clearly better than silver medalist and Final Five teammate Aly Raisman and Russian bronze medalist Aliya Mustafin.
Simone Biles of the United States is on the balance beam in the women's team all-around individual final at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, on Thursday.
Biles became the fourth American woman to win back-to-back mixed martial arts championships and the fifth American champion overall, while cementing her reputation as the best of her generation, and perhaps of all time.
He burst into tears as his final score was announced, and his long journey toward this moment was over.
This achievement puts him in the same category as other top athletes of his generation, like Michael Phelps, who have taken their sport to a new level:
Biles has dominated the sport for the past three years, winning 15 world championship medals, including 10 gold, with programs whose blend of ambition and precision was so astounding that 1984 Olympic champion Mary Lou Retton called him "the best gymnast I've ever seen".
The final test was in Brazil, a race not so much between Biles and the other competitors, but between him and the burden of oversized expectations.
To return to the family home in Spring, Texas, without a handful of gold medals would have been a disappointment.
Simone Biles, left, and Aly Raisman of the United States, left, are in the ring after winning the gold and silver medals (in that order) in the women's team all-around individual event at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, on Thursday.
Biles won his first medal on Tuesday, when he performed the highlight of the day at the homecoming party of retired national team coordinator Martha Karolyn.
While Biles claimed that he never thought about the future on his long climb to the top, that's not entirely true.
Part of his permanto program - which includes his trademark volt control - is adapted to Latin-American music, which would also be a great idea for the street next to the Rio Olympic Stadium.
This is no coincidence.
This girl, who was adopted by her grandparents as a toddler, and whose coach, Aimee Boorman, was discovered by her mother while she was on a field trip to the gym where Boorman coached, has become a powerhouse.
He hasn't lost in a multi-round match since the summer of 2013, and this winning streak will continue for as long as Biles wants.
Even though Mustafina had a small lead after two rounds, it was just an illusion.
The balance beam and the perma-to, with Biles as reigning world champion, were waiting.
He came out on top with 15,433 points and surpassed with 15,933 perm.
Raisman embraced her with benevolence as they awaited the final points - a mere formality - and tears flowed into Biles's glittering red, white and blue bordered eyes as the dream she once wrote her cutting book about came true.
Raisman's performance was a kind of revenge for four years ago when he was tied for third place, but lost to Mustafina in the bronze relay.
This time, the 22-year-old team leader, whom the Americans call "Grandma", was clearly in the lead.
He sent flying kisses to the audience after his final performance in an emotional return that sometimes seemed questionable.
As for Bilec, the 19-year-old's widely circulated tweet earlier this week takes on a whole new meaning:
Police say three victims were shot in a serial murder while they were listening to music in a car.
In the deadliest attack in Phoenix's first serial-murder in a decade, two women and a 12-year-old girl were sitting in a car chatting and listening to music when they were shot, according to a police statement released Thursday.
Authorities say Angela Rochelle Liner, Stefanie R. Ellis and Ellis' daughter Maleah were shot June 12 in a parked car on the highway.
The report says that the gunman, who was standing on the passenger side of the car, fired at the handgun as many as eight times and then fled in another vehicle.
Police say the triple homicide doesn't appear to be the result of a robbery, as the assailant didn't take any handbags or the $2,900 that the other adult victim had.
A Phoenix police spokesman, Sergeant Jonathan Howard, said the shooting prompted investigators to look into whether it was connected to four previous attacks.
In total, seven people have been killed and two others injured in nine attacks over four months in two mainly Latin American neighborhoods.
"This is happening in the neighborhood in front of the house", Howard told CBS affiliate KPHO earlier this month.
The suspect is believed to have used a number of vehicles, including a late 1990s brown Nissan, a late 1990s black BMW, and a white Cadillac or Lincoln.
Investigators have refused to release evidence that would lead them to conclude that the attacks are linked and the same killer.
Ellis, 33, was taken to hospital for treatment of his injuries, where he later died.
Liner, 31, and Ellis' daughter, Maleah, were killed at the scene.
An eyewitness told police that they often sat in a parked car listening to music.
Authorities also released a police report on the shooting, which occurred just a half-hour before the triple homicide, and was targeted by an empty van, which is also believed to be the work of a serial killer.
Forensics found bullet casings, bullet from the seat, and bullet shrapnel from the engine compartment.
Mother of 6-year-old with microcephaly: It's getting better 
Edmund Picciuto, like most six-year-olds, loves singing, toys and, of course, his mother.
But unlike many of his peers, Edmund has a small head, the result of a genetic disorder that his mother, Elizabeth Picciuto, was unaware of when she was pregnant.
When he first came home, my first thought was, "I can't do this".
I can't do this.
I didn't promise you this.
Which is not true at all - of course I promised", he said.
She and her husband, Vincent, were told that Edmund might never learn to recognize them and that he might not even survive.
Some doctors even suggested that he be institutionalized.
"My reaction was that I knew people were still doing it", Picciuto explained.
Edmund walks with a walker.
Edmund didn't sit or crawl until he was three years old, and he still doesn't speak.
But he's slowly reaching some milestones.
He walks with assistance and rides a bicycle.
And she loves playing with her two brothers and singing.
Elizabeth shows Edmund how to use a cloak he invented to say "Would you sing to me?"
"We're going to teach him sign language", Picciuto told CBS News.
But this is not a normal sign language - he tells us that Edmund has invented some of his own.
Microefalia can be caused by a number of things: genetic causes, as in Edmund's case, or viral infections during pregnancy, such as measles or Zika.
The symptoms and prognosis can vary greatly.
It is too early to tell how it will affect the lives of those infected with Zika.
Picciuto remembers the emotional burden of an uncertain future.
I was just asking what's gonna happen.
What's going to happen?
And he doesn't really know yet.
I haven't actually asked for a prediction in a while because I don't expect anyone to be able to actually give me one.
But Picciuto has some hopeful advice for mothers whose babies have a birth defect caused by Zika.
It's getting easier.
You can believe it's going to get better.
You love your child, and your child loves you.
Heavy rain and flooding triggered rescue operations in Mississippi and Louisiana
Heavy rain and widespread flooding in Louisiana prompted the governor to declare a state of emergency on Friday, with more rain expected to hit the state on Saturday.
The National Weather Service reported that numerous rivers in southeastern Louisiana and southern Mississippi were overflowing and causing widespread flooding due to extremely heavy rains.
Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards said that state officials are in constant contact with local authorities and that help is already coming to counties in need.
Mike Steele, a spokesman for the Governor's Office of Emergency Preparedness and Safety, said they're getting requests for floating vehicles, boats and sandbags.
Steele said that Tangipahoa County alone requested tens of thousands of sandbags.
A state of emergency will remain in effect until Saturday in much of south Louisiana.
The weather service said in a statement that the region is expected to receive another three to five centimeters of rain.
In southern Alabama, the flood watch was in effect Friday as the rains continued in the Mobile area.
The Comite River near Baton Rouge and the Amite River near Denham Springs, both in Louisiana, were forecast to set flood peaks over the weekend.
Weather forecaster Alek Krautmann said that both rivers could flood many homes in the suburban areas near Baton Rouge.
He also said that the threat of flooding in the lower Ascension River region is coming as the flooded rivers slowly sink into Lake Maurepas.
The Tickfaw River, which flows south of the Mississippi state line in Liverpool, Louisiana, was at its highest level ever at nine o'clock on Friday morning.
Players are still picking people out of floodwaters in Amite and Wilkinson counties in southwest Mississippi.
Leroy Hansford and his wife and stepson were among those rescued near Gloucester on Friday.
Hansford, 62, says that normally over 400 feet from his home, the water in Beaver Creek rose rapidly during the night.
He says that the other half-brother, who lives nearby, warned him.
"We woke up, and the water just kept rising", Hansford said.
It went all the way up to my waist.
Hansford's wife told her husband that she had not seen the water of the stream so high in the 48 years that she had lived there.
Hansford said that he and his family had all the injuries, and that he was the only one who could swim.
Hansford said that rescue workers rescued the trio in a large, army-style truck and took them to the Gloucester fire station, where the rescued spent the night on Friday.
Krautmann says that the floods will spread rapidly as the heavy rains continue and that authorities are planning evacuation orders.
Krautmann says an eyewitness near Livingston reports 13.75 inches of rain between midnight and Friday morning.
Krautmann said the country was completely saturated with the heavy rain that had continued since Wednesday.
The heavy rainfall and flooding of streets led to the evacuation of residents from their homes in Tangipahoa County and the cancellation of classes in five school districts, officials said.
CBS affiliate WWL reports that in Tangipahoa, a city council member said 200 homes were flooded.
Residents were evacuated to two churches, but both are now under water.
County Executive Robby Miller said that authorities rescued 72 people and seven pets who had been trapped by the rising waters.
The towns of Amite and Hammond have been opened up to shelter those who have been evacuated.
"They can go home when the water starts to recede", he said.
In the city of Hammond, Tanganyika County, a dozen streets were closed because of the rising water, and residents were forced to pick up sandbags to try to keep water out of their homes and businesses.
"The last major flood here was in March", said Lacy Landrum, a city administrator.
This is becoming a similar case.
In Mississippi, Harrison County Emergency Manager Rupert Lacy said that the steady rain continued on the Gulf Coast.
He said that on Thursday a handful of houses were notified of flooding, but so far on Friday there have been no reports of flooding.
Keith Townson, the head of Shopper Value Foods in Amity, has lived in the area for 40 years.
"I've seen water in places I've never seen before", Townson said, "and it's still raining".
With a load of bullets, six-year-old Mahaj Brown survives the Philadelphia shooting
Police say a 6-year-old boy has been shot in Philadelphia, making it the second shooting of a 6-year-old in the city this week.
The child's grandparents told CBS Philadelphia that her name was Mahaj Brown.
The grandparents say that Brown suffered multiple gunshot wounds to his groin, leg, arm, and abdomen, but he was conscious when he was transported to the hospital.
"He suffered a lot, his little body was full of bullets", his grandmother, Delores Melendez, told the station.
I can't believe it. I can't believe it. I know.
At the hospital, the boy's condition is listed as critical, and he has undergone several operations.
The family will tell the station that they expect him to make a full recovery.
The boy was about to start his first grade at the local elementary school.
Brown was one of four people shot in the Germantown block.
Three men were also shot, two 29-year-olds and one 32-year-old.
One of the 29-year-old men was reported to be in critical condition; two other victims were in stable condition, according to CBS Philadelphia.
The child was found shot in the front seat of the car along with a 29-year-old man in critical condition, the station reported.
The other two victims were not in the car, and police are investigating whether any of the injured men could be the shooters.
Investigators are telling CBS Philadelphia that it appears there was a crossfire between multiple shooters.
Assault-type shells, derived from different assault weapons, filled the scene.
It seems that this was definitely a continuous struggle.
There were shelters on both sides of the street.
"So it looks like there were several armed combatants here, and they were active in combat", Philadelphia Police Chief Anthony Ginaldi told the station.
Several houses and vehicles in the area were also hit.
No arrests have been made, and according to the latest information, the police are investigating the surveillance footage.
Another six-year-old girl was accidentally shot in the arm Tuesday while playing outside her home in the West Oak Lane neighborhood.
He's recovering, and the police are still looking for a suspect.
Why do we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie?
That's what I'm calling this year's women's Olympic gymnastics team, for more than one reason.
First of all, I've been to every Summer Olympics since 1984, and the U.S. has never been so dominant.
And second, this team includes three gymnasts, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren Laurie Hernandez, who have inspired many girls of color.
The composition of this team, complemented by the Jewish Aly Raisman and the Catholic Madison Kocian, makes everyone proud.
This team looks like America at last.
It's also established black and Hispanic women at the top of the sport.
For the past four years, the most successful female gymnast has been an African-American.
Last year, Simone and Gabby were first and second.
This is so cool.
At the last Olympics, Gabby Douglas surprised the world by winning the Olympic gold medal, and America cheered.
Now the world has witnessed the incredible feats of three-time world champion Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, who have unleashed unexpected but masterful programs of fitness.
On Thursday, Simone became the fourth American woman to win consecutive women's singles and mixed doubles gold medals.
And team mate Aly Raisman took silver.
We're seeing the pinnacle of the sport, but it's not what's happening in gyms across the country.
Simone, Gabby and Laurie all followed the same path as Aly and Madison when they made the Olympic team.
They are the Final Five because there will be only four gymnasts on the next Olympic gymnastics team, and this is Marta Karoly's last year as a coach.
The reality, however, is that gymnastics is an expensive sport, and gymnasts are trained primarily in private gymnasiums, run by parents who pay for the training, facilities, travel, uniforms, competition fees, hotel fees (for the coaches and their gymnasts and families), and so on.
A large number of these gymnastic clubs are located in affluent suburban neighborhoods that can support the sport.
These are the clubs where gymnasts get all their training, and this is an expensive and long-term commitment to the gymnasts' families.
Aimee Boorman, coach of Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, coach of Laurie Hernandez, have both been coaching their athletes since they started gymnastics.
We need to bring more affordable and accessible fitness training to the communities where the many young girls inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie live.
I started my gymnastics foundation 20 years ago.
In my organization, we have offered free and low-cost gymnastics in Harlem to over 15,000 urban youth (mostly black and Latino) and have trained national and international champions.
In September, we're expanding to Detroit, my hometown, to offer high-level gymnastics to young people who deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport.
Exercise develops strength, flexibility, and coordination, as well as mental diligence, discipline, and determination.
This combination offers lifelong benefits for good health and for academic and professional success.
The inspiration of this team is getting thousands of young girls to start gymnastics, and it's amazing.
Participating in sports is so important, especially for girls.
These are exciting times.
Thank you Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for showing the serious "girl power" of winning Olympic team gold, and for motivating so many young girls from all backgrounds to start on the road to healthy, strong and successful young women.
Medical students organizing new strikes after Jeremy Hunt's proposal was rejected.
Ministers had hoped to end the dispute over changes by agreeing to an improved agreement with the British Medical Association's medical staff, but 58% of the 37,000 medical trainees who took part in the vote rejected it.
In July, Hunt revealed plans to force the contract, saying the NHS was on "unknown ground" and that even minor additional delays would harm staff and patients.
The first trainee doctors will be transferred to a new contract that includes changes to night and weekend working patterns to improve care during the final few hours.
Dr Ellen McCourt, chair of the BMA's trainee doctors committee, said in a statement last night: 'Trainee doctors still have serious concerns about the proposed agreement, particularly that it will exacerbate the existing labour shortage and that it will not treat all doctors equally.
With only eight weeks left before the first group of doctors are transferred to the new contract, progress must be made and time is running out.
BMA's attempts to resolve the dispute through negotiations have been met with reluctance on the part of the government to participate and at times with profound silence.
Despite Jeremy Hunt's promise last month that his door was always open.
Jeremy Hunt must act now, remove the constraint and heed the concerns of the medical students.
If he doesn't, the medical interns are prepared to continue with the work-study.
The latest strike in late April meant the postponement of almost 13,000 routine surgeries and 100,000 appointments, with nurses and consulting doctors being recruited to replace doctors on call.
The Ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the changes by agreeing to an improved agreement with the British Medical Association.
The BMA wants to improve weekend pay for the 54,000 trainees under the contract.
Daniel Mortimer, the CEO of NHS Employers, appealed to trainees not to go on strike.
Mortimer said: 'Work struggles achieve very little or nothing, but they put pressure on teams and services already in a demanding situation, and cause anxiety, stress and disruption to patients, carers and their families.'
In the last two months we have been talking to the Junior Doctors Committee and, together with the Ministry of Health and others, have responded positively to their concerns about the Guardian Role and whistleblowing.
Employers were hopeful that the continued positive debate on other important issues - such as development, the flexibility of education, further training for returning sabbatical workers, the cost of education, mutual recognition of the curriculum, free tuition and the gender pay gap in medicine - would be a sign of the seriousness of employers, Health Education England and the Department of Health in honouring the agreements reached with the BMA in May.
A £2 a day drug can reduce the risk of heart attack
Thousands of heart attack patients are benefiting from a drug that costs two pounds a day after the authorities recommended that it be given to people for longer.
The anticoagulant medicine ticagrelor reduces the risk of recurrent seizures in people with heart disease.
It is given for 12 months after a heart attack to reduce the risk of stroke or another attack.
The NHS watchdog NICE has advised that it should be given to people for four years to still reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
But now the NHS's regulator NICE has advised that it should be given to people for four years to still reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
About 140,000 people in England suffer a heart attack each year, and a quarter of these suffer a second heart attack or stroke.
Heart attacks and strokes are caused by the accumulation of fatty material in the wall of the artery, which forms a clot.
If the stoma ruptures, it can cause a blood clot that blocks the flow of blood to the heart, causing a heart attack.
If the clot breaks off, it can travel through the blood and cut off blood flow to the brain, causing a stroke.
People who have already had one seizure are at increased risk of having another.
Ticagrelor, produced by the British company AstraZeneca and sold under the trade name Brilique, reduces this risk by making clots less likely.
The draft NICE guideline published today recommends that humans receive 90 mg of ticagrelor for 12 months, followed by 60 mg of aspirin taken twice daily for the next two years.
Professor Carole Longson, director of the NICE Health Technology Assessment Centre, said: 'Despite the availability of effective treatment to prevent progression, up to a quarter of people who have had a heart attack will later have another heart attack or stroke, often with devastating consequences.'
Fear of relapse can have a significant negative impact on a person's quality of life.
The evidence shows that ticagrelor, in combination with aspirin, is effective in reducing the risk of subsequent heart attacks and strokes in people who have already had a heart attack.
In our initial recommendation of ticagrelor, we are pleased to be able to increase the number of treatment options available to the many thousands of people who could potentially benefit from them.
Since data on the efficacy and safety of ticagrelor, especially with regard to the risk of bleeding, are limited for periods of more than three years, the draft guidance does not recommend treatment beyond this period.
The culture of political correctness allows electoral fraud to flourish in Muslim areas
Former Tower Hamlets mayor Lutfur Rahman was removed from office last year for corruption, giving a boost to the government's report.
A culture of political correctness has led to widespread voter fraud in Muslim communities being ignored, a shocking government report reveals today.
Former government minister Sir Eric Pickles is scolding police, election officials and city councils for ignoring evidence of voter fraud due to race and religious hypersensitivity.
The former community secretary, now the emperor of anti-corruption, said that voter intimidation on religious grounds is so serious that the police should be allowed to put guard chains outside polling stations to protect frightened voters.
He recommends that voters should present an ID card when voting to prove who they are.
Today, all you have to do is give your name and address.
The report even suggests that an indelible ink be put on the finger of the voter so that no one can vote twice.
Whistleblowers should be better protected, Sir Eric says.
He calls for greater access for the press to the Council's documents and to decisions taken by informal committees or working groups.
'This would not only protect against electoral fraud, but it would also protect local government from the wider culture of corruption and financial fraud that goes hand in hand with electoral fraud,' he said.
The report was commissioned by the government following the Tower Hamlets by-election scandal in east London.
Last year, a special election court ruled that the incumbent mayor, Lutfur Rahman, should be removed from office following numerous corruption and illegal charges.
The Court found that Rahman had 'quietly distorted' the religious sentiments of his Muslim community and had silenced his critics by accusing them of racism and Islamophobia.
Rahman is said to have "led his election campaign on the grounds that it was the religious duty of faithful Muslims to vote for him".
As many as 300 votes were questionable or the result of a person voting for someone else.
Sir Eric said there's evidence of fraud all over the country.
He expressed particular concern at the election campaign postponed by the ballot, where senior members of the Muslim community were said to have pressured people to vote for their chosen candidate.
Sir Eric, pictured, made several recommendations for the cleanup of the voting system, including the use of identity cards to prove identity.
The report states: There was evidence that vulnerable members of some ethnic minority communities, particularly women and young people, were pressured to vote according to the will of elders, especially in communities with Pakistani or Bangladeshi backgrounds.
Concern was expressed that...this behaviour had been ignored by the state institutions because of 'politically correct' racial and religious sensitivities.
Sir Eric made 50 suggestions to clean up the system, including banning the handling of postal ballots by political activists to stop the accumulation of votes.
The report, which is being considered by Theresa May, also calls for stronger checks on registrants to prevent the electoral register from being used for immigration and compensation fraud.
Consider options for verifying voters' identity before voting.
Put an indelible ink on the finger of the voter so that no one can vote twice.
Perform systematic nationality checks to ensure they are eligible to vote.
The Commission is therefore proposing to introduce a three-year limit on requests for automatic postal voting.
Prevent political activists from dealing with pre-recorded votes and postal envelopes containing votes.
Have the police put security chains around the polling stations.
Amend the law to make it easier to charge people with intimidation under the Representation of the People Act 1983.
Make it illegal to take pictures at polling stations.
Require that English is used only at polling stations (except in Wales).
Strengthen training to ensure that staff adhere to the rule that the voter must go to the voting booth alone.
Sir Eric told the Greater London Police Force it was "amazing" that no criminal charges had been brought after the Tower Hamlets incident.
The Constitutional Court was set aside following the numerous corrupt and illegal acts of Lutfur Rahman and his officials, he said.
He was found guilty on a number of grounds, without a presumption of guilt, according to the criminal-law exhibition.
He also criticised the ineffective 'browser' checks at the voter register offices of the city councils.
Sir Eric said, "My last year in Tower Hamlets was a wake-up call.
Our nation has a glorious heritage as the birthplace of parliaments, but this worrying and covert spread of electoral fraud and denial of facts by certain groups threatens this good reputation.
Mad Kate, the cycling double-legged and other celebrity-appearing images from the Rio Olympics
This week, fans at the Rio 2016 Olympics have been baffled by French cyclist Pauline Ferrand-Prevotte, who has been proven to be the Duchess of Cambridge's impressive doppelganger.
But the 24-year-old Olympic representative is certainly not the only athlete this summer to be able to boast about his famous double - at least according to social media.
So in honor of the Rio Games and all the famous faces currently on our screens, FEMAIL has compiled a list of Olympic athletes who look like Hollywood celebrities.
Hunter and wolf: U.S. men's archery team member Brady Ellison, left, has been compared to Leonardo DiCaprio since he was a child
In addition to Kate's bicycle-shaped twin, many online have been quick to point out how a certain archer might be the twin of star Leonardo DiCaprio.
U.S. men's archery team member Brady Ellison has caused a storm on Twitter after images of him appearing to look as scary as the star of The Wolf of Wall Street surfaced.
And in fact, upon becoming aware of the social media frenzy, the archer admitted that he had been told since childhood that he looked like Leo.
"I don't see much resemblance, except maybe a beard", Brady told the Huffington Post.
He's a good-looking guy, so I guess this is a compliment.
One of the most popular comparisons of London 2012 is sure to resurface this year: the startling resemblance between British height rival Greg Rutherford and popular actor Neil Patrick Harris.
Russian gymnast Alya Mustafa, with her large, expressive eyes, has been said to be the doppelganger of Cuban-American singer Gloria Estefan.
And in the pool, South African swimmer Cameron van der Burgh has been compared to Glee star Matthew Morrison for years.
This user thinks Nathan is the athletic version of the Inception actor.
Another long-standing comparison has been between tennis star Rafael Nadal and actor Josh Hartnett, both of whom have similarly strong eyebrows and lips.
Russian silver medalist Yulia Efimova has more in common with Annalynne McCord than tanned skin and blond hair, while U.S. team member Adrian Nathan is said by fans to resemble "Joseph Gordon Levitt's athletic version".
Heavy women: football star Hope Solo, left, and Dexter actress Jennifer Carpenter, right, share the same face shape and eyes
No: One Twitter user was very happy that others saw the similarities
Presentation of the theory: According to this user, there may be a reason between the similarity of the pair
One Twitter user recently expressed happiness on the site that "some people on the Internet think Hope Solo and Jennifer Carpenter are actually identical".
And the American football star and the Dexter star really do have an incredibly similar facial features and eyes.
Other popular comparisons have included Kerri Walsh-Jennings and her smile, which is almost identical to that of actress Laura Linney, and gold medal-winning gymnast Gabby Douglas, whose beautiful broad smile matches that of Bring It On star Gabrielle Union.
CBC Olympic commentator apologizes after saying Chinese swimmer 'died like a pig'
On Wednesday, the CBC's live Olympic broadcast was infuriated by Byron MacDonald's analysis of the news of the fourth-place finish of 14-year-old Ai Yanhan in the women's 4x200-meter freestyle relay.
The Canadian broadcaster CBC has had to apologize after a reporter said that a 14-year-old Chinese woman had been stung by a snake and died during the race.
Broadcaster Byron MacDonald thought his microphone was off when he started sharing some of his own opinions in the women's 4x200-meter freestyle final.
MacDonald, who came to CBC News to bring the color, was heard to say, "That little 14-year-old from China was a total dick, baby.
Too eager, lost like a bad smell, died like a pig.
Thank you for that.
Chinese swimmer Ai Yanhan, 14, was one second slower than Canada's Taylor Ruck, giving Canada a chance to catch up with China.
Viewers across Canada reacted online to the language and tone of the video.
Emmett Macfarlane tweeted:  Did the CBC anchor just say that a 14-year-old swimmer from China died like a pig???
The idiot didn't realize he was still on the air.
China's Ai Yanhania was pictured in the women's 4 x 200 metres freestyle final as follows: That little 14-year-old from China is mumbling, baby.
The criticism against Byron MacDonald on Twitter was blunt and quick, with many challenging him.
Twitter users couldn't help themselves hearing how reckless Byron MacDonald was.
Another Twitter user, Sarah Paradis, wrote: Wow #ByronMacDonald. #ByronMacDonald is a very powerful tool for the government.
You represent CBC and Canada and make us all sound like a racist bunch. #disgusting. 
Shortly after this, Scott Russell, who hosted the CBC broadcast, apologized for MacDonald's comment on the live broadcast, saying: "We are sorry that the comment about the swimming competition was aired.
It was a poor choice of words, and we regret that it happened.
CBC ended up apologizing over 90 times to people who had tweeted in response to the comment.
His classmate Scott Russell had to apologize for MacDonald.
The CBC then copied and pasted an apology to the more than 90 Twitter users who had complained about MacDonald's comments.
The network also quickly apologized and released a statement.
We deeply regret that these statements were made and that they were broadcast live.
We took action last night, and apologized live to our viewers and social media followers.
For the sake of clarity, it should be noted that Byron's comments were about the swimming performance, not him as a person.
But it was an inappropriate and regrettable choice of words, and Byron is very sorry for what he said.
On Thursday afternoon, MacDonald apologized on live television and tried to clarify his remarks by stating that he did not intend for it to be construed as a personal attack.
"I would like to apologize at this moment for the comment I made last night after the women's message", he said on the CBC Olympic broadcast.
I was referring to the act of swimming, not to him as a person.
I don't think it's necessary to say that I didn't mean it as disrespectful and I'm really sorry.
A prime customer was shocked by a woman who brazenly adjusted underwear in the middle of a store.
The customers didn't know where to look when the woman stripped in the middle of the Primarki store to try on her underwear.
It did not improve matters that after assessing how he looked in his trousers, she peeled them off and put them back on the shelf.
He continued to wander and eventually made four pairs of underpants in a shop at the Bouverie Place shopping centre in Folkestone.
Primarkin's Bouverie Place Mall in Folkestone, where a woman sewed underpants and then put them back on the shelf
Jenny Davidson, a mother of two who was in the store at the same time, said that after trying on the underwear, the mysterious woman changed back and walked out of the store without buying anything.
He said, "People couldn't believe their eyes".
She stood in the middle of the store floor, took a pair of underwear on display, undressed in her own underwear and underwear and put on her matching legs.
He didn't even try to find a remote place to make amends, he just stood there shamelessly.
Everyone stared as she took off her underpants, obviously not liking them, because she put them back on the shelf. 
He did the same for three more pairs before finally deciding that he didn't like anything he saw, he got dressed again and walked out.
He didn't seem to care who was looking or thinking about the person who would end up buying the underwear he was fitting.
Davidson, 33, of Kent, said: 'It's disgusting to think of someone taking home underwear that someone else has tried on but hasn't cleaned.'
The incident happened on Tuesday afternoon.
Davidson added: "I said that the staff apparently tried to remove the garments from sale after she left, which is fine".
It would be terrible to go home with new underpants and find that another woman has put them on and taken them off and they haven't been washed.
A representative of the Mayor said: "The Mayor is aware of the incident that occurred in the Folkestone store on Tuesday, August 9th.
All of these products have been withdrawn from the market.
This is how you can defend yourself against armed attacks using Krav Maga
The world is dangerous, but this video from Dailymail.com can make it a little safer for you.
We spoke with Krav Maga Federation Grandmaster Rhon Mizrachi, who lives in New York, to find out how to deal with gun-wielding robbers at close range.
Whether you're approached from the front or the back, this video shows you how to pay back the attacker in kind.
According to Mizrachi, if you are approached from behind, the first thing you should do is turn around so you can see your attacker and avoid the line of fire.
Then you grab the weapon between your elbow and your shoulder before you hit the attacker in the face with your free elbow.
Keep hitting your knee on the nipple, and as the attacker goes from pain to numbness, you wrench the weapon from his hands, hit him in the face with the back of the weapon, and then back away, holding the weapon pointed at him.
If an armed person approaches from the front, the technique is the same: remove your body from the line of fire, grab the weapon, and turn it around so that the criminal cannot fire.
At the same time, put the weight on the gun and hit the attacker in the chest, then twist the gun from his grip, back away and point the gun at him.
Does that sound difficult?
Watch the video of Mizrachi doing exactly this.
But remember, if you're not a grand master of Krav Maga, the safest way out of a robbery situation is to give up your money.
Traveller Ian Wright scours the dirtiest places in Europe for his guidebook
The British athlete has put his immune system and vomiting reflexes to the test by licking some of the dirtiest and most nightmarish places in Europe.
Suffolk travel writer and broadcaster Ian Wright, 51, licked a euro note, a piccadilly railing at the Circus, a train toilet flush button and a public telephone in Russia to prove the strength of his immune system.
Before licking each object, he used the photometer to show himself and us the situation he was in.
However, the experiment that was made into the movie The Power of the Inner Light produced surprising results.
The idea of licking the washing button of a train used by thousands of people may seem completely repulsive, but in fact, the kitchen sink is more likely to contain bad bacteria.
While traveling through Europe, Wright spoke continually to doctors and medical professionals about strengthening gut bacteria and his own health.
Fortunately, nothing he licked left him anything but a bad taste in his mouth.
Wright became known as a test of gut endurance as he traveled the world and ate strange and wonderful things.
This task, from the railway station railings to the flushing button on a toilet seat, really tested his immune system.
In a film made, he said:  Since childhood I have been rather careless about my health, and I have put all kinds of things into my mouth, from soil, worms, and even water. 
He really cemented his reputation during the movie.
The only thing he refused was a filthy Russian public toilet.
His sample had a photometer reading of over 4,000 units.
For comparison, the readings of freshly washed hands should be less than 60.
But in a Russian public toilet, he refused to shave when the photometer read more than 4,000 units and the freshly washed hands were less than 60.
Wright has produced a travel film, In Search of the Force Within, together with Finnish dairy farmer Valio, which shows the amount of bacteria in different places, such as the bathroom.
In the movie, the guy said, "This is probably the worst thing I've ever smelled in a toilet".
There's nothing dirtier than that!
I'm not gonna eat anything because it's creepy in here.
The trail of inner strength was produced in conjunction with the Finnish dairy, Valio.
The company offered Wright Valio Gefilus, which contains lactic acid bacteria and vitamins C and D, which help boost human gut bacteria and the immune system.
Niko Vuorenmaa, Head of Snacks, Meats and New Categories at Valio, said: "We really wanted to offer something new to consumers.
Something that would be fascinating to look at, and that would explain the benefits of probiotics.
We were throwing a lot of crazy ideas in the air, and we came up with this idea of, "Let's play for Ian".
They claim that the interest in gut health is becoming a worldwide phenomenon.
So instead of just talking about products, we wanted to put them in a larger context: telling you about the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment, the importance of gut health and its connection to the immune system.
The growing interest in gut health is a worldwide phenomenon, and with this documentary, we can tell consumers more about it in an interesting way.
I think the documentary also shows that we have a great sense of humor!
The documentary's director Tom Hakala added: 'Let's put it this way: if Ian had refused to do some of the things I asked him to do, like the Russian toilet shown in the film, I would have lost my respect for him.'
Understandably, some of the things that Ian swallowed were easier for him to do, while others were quite difficult.
I'm glad we got some of those filthy licks saved.
In a 2015 survey by Valio, 84% of respondents specifically linked lactic acid bacteria to gut health, and 58% said they at least occasionally use products with added lactic acid bacteria.
A family of robbers destroyed a tenement in Saltash, Cornwall, before the eviction.
A family of robbers caused £50,000 worth of damage to their rental property after they were evicted because of neighbour terrorism.
Tanya Keldon and her partner Shaun Trebilcock have been evicted from their property in Saltash, Cornwall, after being sued on numerous occasions.
After being forcibly removed from the property, the appalled housing company officials noted that the property was in poor condition.
There were bullet holes in the walls, the floorboards were torn, the trash was scattered on the floor, and the walls were graffitied.
The family has now moved elsewhere and is believed to be living in private accommodation.
Conna McEvoy, the landlord of Cornwall Housing, said he was afraid the property would be beyond repair.
He said: 'This has been a nightmare for the residents and I don't think people should have to live like this.
There's a lot to consider here, as this property is likely to be known by the less-friendly groups in Cornwall.
This family is notorious, and their name is notorious.
The couple had three sons who lived on the property at one time or another, and police said that the family's violence included street fights with baseball bats, intimidation of nearby residents, drug use, drug dealing, and excessive shouting, arguing, and swearing.
Skeldon, 47, whose name was on the lease, was sentenced in June for disorderly conduct.
In many of the rooms under the demolition roof, old trash was found.
The floorboards of a property that had been used to smuggle drugs had been pulled up.
Neighbors said the family was seen fighting in the street and that the police were regularly called.
Cornwall Housing evicted a woman and her partner from their property this week after giving them an extended period of 11 weeks to move voluntarily.
Relieved neighbors praised the divorce, saying that their lives had become a living hell.
One said, "They didn't care about anybody".
We've lived next door to them for 20 years, and it's always been bad.
We've seen the police here so many times, you can't believe how many times.
We couldn't sleep this morning.
We got up because it was so quiet in here - we're not used to it!
It's wonderful, now that they're finally gone.
Adam Fitzpatrick, the executive director of the Cornwall Housing Neighborhood Association, said the family had failed to cooperate with local authorities.
The family lived in the house for 20 years, and the police were called to the property often.
Trash and old toys have been thrown down the rampant wall of the apartment building.
He added: 'It is a pity that the resident did not take any responsibility for his own behaviour and that of his family, because eviction is always the last thing Cornwall Housing considers doing.
This was a very difficult case, for the conduct was extreme, and their actions must have horrified the neighbors.
I appreciate all the work that my team, the Devon and Cornwall police, and the brave members of the community have done to give us the information.
I hope this development brings some comfort to the neighbors and sends a message that anti-social behaviour is not tolerated.
Fitzpatrick said the three boys all lived on the property at different times, but they were all in their 20s.
After the hunt, a dirty mattress was left on the floor of one bedroom.
The housing company employees now have to clean up the garbage around the house
In 2014, police raided the property and found over 70g of cannabis, along with weights, supplies and £1,700 in cash.
Skeldon was fined after pleading guilty to possession of Class B drugs with intent to distribute.
He claimed the money was intended for the headstone of his son, Lee Skeldon, who died in a car accident in 2013.
Apparently, Tanya and her partner are now homeless and living in a private home in Plymouth.
Many of the rooms in the house were covered with graffiti.
Police say they're trying to evict residents who flout the rules of their lease.
Angela Crow of Devon and Cornwall Police said the eviction was a clear warning to other tenants who continue to flout the rules.
'This is a message to those who think their behaviour is without consequences, and to those who suffer from such behaviour', he said.
The Devon and Cornwall Police will never tolerate criminal and anti-social behaviour and will continue to work with their partners to protect our communities.
Tourists in Portugal were horrified when a military jet flew over the beach at a low tide
Sun-worshiping tourists in Aveiro, Portugal, experienced a shock to their lives
A P-3C Orion of the Portuguese Air Force was flying very low
The Air Force said it was a training flight and insisted that there was no threat to safety.
At that very moment, terrified tourists panicked as a low-flying jet swept over the crowded beach.
A dramatic recording shows a military plane coming within striking distance of sun worshippers on a sandy beach in Aveiro, northern Portugal.
The vacationers stood up as they understandably became concerned about the noise from the jet, even though they did not see what was coming toward them from behind the clouds.
The incident took place in Costa Nova, near Aveiro, yesterday afternoon.
One of the many vacationers who posted videos of the dramatic flight on social media was Daniel Fernandes, who said: "It passed by twice at a really low level, and at one point it looked like it was going to crash to the ground".
Nuno Arroja added: "I was surfing and I really felt like a plane was falling on me".
Tourists on the beach in Aveiro were horrified when the plane emerged from the darkness and flew at an incredibly low altitude.
The Portuguese Air Force said today that the pilot of the P-3C Orion was on a training flight to identify fishing boats near the coast and the plane had to land so low because it was the only way to check the boats.
He said that the jet had flown at a much lower altitude than usual because of poor visibility from smoke from nearby land fires, but the air force assured that no one's safety was in danger.
This summer, wildfires have ravaged parts of mainland Portugal, and four people have died on the island of Madeira.
The Portuguese Air Force said today that the pilot had to fly low due to conditions that affected visibility, smoke from the fires and thick fog.
The plane was on a training flight, and as part of the exercise, the pilot was asked to identify fishing boats.
Export performance in the first half of the year better than expected
The South Karelian Social and Health District (Eksote) outperformed its target by 3.4 million euros in the period January to June.
Exoto's profit was EUR 4.3 million in surplus in the first half of the year.
The results were particularly good in family and social services, where the development of preventive services has led to the dismantling of institutional care.
The guarantee was implemented in all operations.
This year, the Exote is looking to shorten the lines of operations.
The excess shall cover the deficit previously incurred by the surplus.
The excess may be used to cut lines and buy procedures for patients.
The full year is expected to be EUR 4.6 million better than planned.
The Exot board will discuss the half-yearly report at its meeting next Wednesday.
70 Special Forces soldiers have taken the oath of military allegiance at Immola.
Seventy men from the Border and Coast Guard Academy took the military oath on Friday.
The military ceremony for the men of the Border and Coast Guard Academy was held in Imola on Friday.
The 10th Special Forces Military School's graduation ceremony was held at the garrison's sports field.
The oath of military allegiance was taken by 70 men of the army.
The special border guards are trained for demanding border security, intelligence and combat missions.
They serve for 347 days.
This year, 310 kids applied to be Special Forces.
Of these, 250 were invited to take part in the selection tests.
Special border guards have been trained in Imola since 2007.
The veterans' meeting, organised in conjunction with the ceremony, was attended by five veterans of the border troops during the war.
The average age of those in attendance is now 90 years old.
The oldest veterans attending the event were born in 1918.
The district is a robbery-free area - the crime investigation service helps to solve crimes and reveals serious crime - ESS.fi
Since the beginning of 2014, each of the 11 police departments in Finland has had a RTA, or Criminal Intelligence and Analysis Unit.
The unit's operations are invisible from the outside.
The police department in Hämeen has a total of four police officers in Lahti and Hämeenlinna.
It's being driven by a sergeant stationed in Lahti.
The Commissioner responsible for the execution of the budget is Mr Lahde.
In addition, the strength of the unit includes a dedicated civilian IT staff in Hämeenlinna.
All working in civilian clothes.
The unit has proven its usefulness and its necessity, says Assistant Chief of Police Tero Seppänen.
The RTA unit produces various reports for other police.
In the course of the investigation, it has, among other things, obtained information on asylum seekers.
The most recent reform of working methods
The creation of the analysis units is a modern police reform.
The goal has been to prevent crime, so that the police will be less likely to go to the scene of a crime until they are alerted.
The information collected and analysed by the unit will help to target daily police action to where it is most needed.
The reform of the police administration led to the establishment of one Criminal Intelligence Centre, three national units and a Criminal Intelligence Unit for each police institution.
The PTR Centre, which is part of the Central Crime Police of Vantaa, is responsible for the national activities.
As the name suggests, PTR units are staffed by people from the Police, Customs and Border Guard.
RTAs, on the other hand, work in areas divided up by police departments and are responsible for providing information to both local and national police forces.
The search extends beyond your own territory.
Whereas an individual police officer knows what has happened during his 12-hour shift, the RTA unit's job is to know what is happening in the entire police department.
Intelligence extends beyond the confines of your own institution, because so does crime.
The people who work in the RTA have better computer skills than the regular police.
The unit uses registers, the alert database and observations to alert the police to new phenomena, productive crimes or similar offences.
This is called classification, and it's one of the most important tools in criminal investigation.
Every human being has his own way of doing things.
The handprint is also seen in the work, whether it is honest or criminal.
The way it's done, it's a certain image of the perpetrator.
The classification can be done either by the method or by the person, depending on which the police have more information.
Criminals Learn From Their Mistakes
RTA employees don't go around town with their collars up, but their work isn't completely public either.
Neither the methods used by criminals themselves are disclosed, since this could lead to the development of the activities of professional criminals, who would thus seek to impede the police's efforts to combat crime.
The police shall disclose the methods to the public if they anticipate the threat they pose.
For example, the way that empty apartments were marked in the news during the housing demolitions in early summer.
In it, the perpetrators put a stick, a button or a piece of tape on the outside door of the apartment to test whether the occupants were really on the move.
The file shall be made available to at least the parties.
The crime lab has found that even the most professional criminals learn from their mistakes.
The most sophisticated will order a court-martial record, which may, for example, reveal that fingerprints were found at the scene.
Next time we're gonna go after a thief, we're gonna go with the gloves on.
The case has been investigated by Deputy Chief of Police Tero Seppä Hämeen, Inspector Tuomo Lepolaa of the East Finland Police, Crime Commissioner Sami Joutjärve of the Joensuu Police Station and Inspector of Crime Arto Tuomelaa of the Central Crime Police.
Police gather and analyze information to plan practical actions.
The background is the decline in the volume of labour and finance.
The first steps towards a new way of working were taken 30 years ago.
The most recent change was the three-phase PORA reform which ended at the end of 2013.
National cooperation involves collecting information outside the own institution and the borders of Finland.
A schoolgirl from London, affiliated with ISIS, was killed in Syria.
Kadiza Sultana, one of three British schoolgirls who left London last year to join ISIS, is reported to have died in Syria.
Lawyer Tasnime Akunjee said the girl's family heard she died in Raqqa, Syria, a few weeks ago.
ITV News reported on Thursday that the girl was believed to have been killed in a Russian airstrike on Raqqa, the group's base in the country.
The sultan was 17 years old and, according to her family, she had just died while planning to flee the war-torn country and return to Britain.
'We can only hope that the only benefit of the case is that it can act as a tombstone and a testament to others that there are real risks involved in going into a war zone - that it could get people to give up making such a decision,' Akunjee said.
In February 2015, Sultana and two other schoolgirls from East London flew to Turkey, from where they took a bus to the Syrian border.
The Sultan's family was told that she had married an ISIS fighter in Syria and was widowed after only a few months.
Reid says Clinton thinks Garland is a candidate for the Supreme Court if he's elected.
Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid says he's convinced that Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton will nominate Justice Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court if she's elected president.
Senate Republicans have blocked Garland's confirmation since President Barack Obama appointed him in March.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell says the next president will choose a replacement for the late Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia.
Reid said in a conference call Thursday that he predicts with "a degree of certainty" that Clinton will choose Garland.
Reid's representative later said that he had not spoken to Clinton directly about whether he would appoint Garland, and that it was speculation.
He praised Garland and said the Clinton team wouldn't want to "ride the boat" with a new selection.
Judge Garland is the Chief Judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.
Reid said that the Republicans blocking Garland's nomination are the "cowards and enablers" of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump.
He said Trump was unfit to hold office.
Treats says that the nude calendar is for "women as well as men".
Treats magazine is collaborating with photographer David Bellemere to publish a Pirelli-inspired calendar from the 1970s for 2017.
But instead of naked celebrities, they're going to find the next top-notch generation in their 2017 NU Muses calendar.
Treats chairman Steve Shaw told us earlier this year that his high-profile nude magazine was different from the old-school Playboy because "Playboy is for men".
I do this for women.
Apparently, he thinks the calendar is for them.
"We need to start showing timeless and classic nudity again where women, as well as men, feel comfortable and inspired by these images of female nudity", Shaw said in a press release announcing the calendar.
Women want to be part of this project because it's beautiful art.
Models can submit photos online or in person at open casting events in Los Angeles and New York.
The Destination of Vinyl: Who Really Buys the Records?
Lonely, middle-aged men who love vinyl records.
Before you rush to fill the comment section with the irritating insults of Not All Single Middle-Aged Men, note that this claim is based on actual data.
According to YouGov, the much-discussed re-emergence of records is not due to the fact that more and more millennials are becoming enthusiastic about the novelty of physical objects, but rather the craze for the middle ages.
Apparently, those who have recently bought vinyl records are most likely to be between the ages of 45 and 54.
In fact, the most unlikely to buy a record is the 18 to 24 age group.
It is also not just a matter of amateur collecting, but of emotional perception: older vinyl buyers are somewhat more likely to keep their emotions to themselves (56% vs 53%) and enjoy being alone (69% vs 66%).
But are the YouGov results true?
If this blog was a television news report, the camera would follow me as I walk down the middle of a busy street in SoHo, wearing a modest gray suit, waving vigorously before stopping, forming a cup from my hands, and saying something authoritative, like, "Let's look into this".
Let's take a closer look.
While the charm and dirt of Soho are slowly being stripped away - hotels, chain restaurants and stores, and office supply stores now fill buildings that once housed independent businesses - a handful of gorgeous specialty record stores still remain.
For the next section, I would probably ask the camera to stop filming for a moment, as I stand very close to different men in some of these stores, trying to make an assessment by observing their age and emotional characteristics.
Stuart, 55, from Glasgow, whom I follow from Sister Ray (count: two young women, three middle-aged men) to Reckless Records (count: eight middle-aged men, one woman, probably in her twenties), spends his afternoon in London for a meeting, and tours the shops to spend a few hours.
I'll ask if he's a collector.
"I am", he says.
I have about 3,000 or 4,000 records.
These plates, shown in the above image (he e-mailed the sample, I did not follow him home), cover the walls of his living room.
The reason for such a huge number of records and singles is partly due to his disposable income: he can now buy records that he could not afford when they were originally released, and he can buy back those he sold when he was young and broke.
"A lot of the stuff I buy is from the late '60s and early '70s, records that were released when I was 11 or 12, records that I was probably a little too young to buy", he says.
He agrees that record buyers are more likely to be introverts who enjoy their own company, adding: "I don't smoke or drink much.
This is my bad.
Wez, 25, who works at Sister Ray, also believes that many of the clients she meets fit the profile of YouGov.
But he has noticed a new wave of people who have been affected by the media enthusiasm, people who have heard that records are back in fashion and who have become compelled to buy their old records back.
The discussions I've had have shown that people have generally got rid of their collection in 1998 or 1999.
Customers who sold their vinyl to buy CDs now sell CDs to buy their records back, he says.
This may explain the increase in the number of vinyl herring of a certain age.
But what about the alleged emotional impact of the records?
In a store like Phonic, it takes a few seconds to realize that record stores provide a comforting community for like-minded types.
Wez says some of the older customers have been hurt, especially by the proximity system.
Some vinyl fans may become entranced with the digital world and choose to rely on the permanence of familiar record covers; objects that evoke memories of the happy days of adolescence.
"I think sometimes it can be about filling a void or some sort of comfort that owning things can bring", says Wez.
As a collector myself, I admit that this is true, and I believe it is true for many people.
It's an easy way to fill your mind.
"We're like their social workers!" another worker said, standing behind the counter.
A survey carried out by ICM in April revealed that almost 50% of people who had bought a vinyl record in the previous month had not yet listened to it.
The survey also found that 41% of the respondents had a turntable that they never used, while 7% of the vinyl tapes did not have a turntable.
At this point in the news report, I'd probably look seriously worried as I browse through the bossa nova collections.
This "reward" view of awakening is something that Jonny, 42, also of Sounds of the Universe, has noticed.
"Somebody came in a little while ago and said, 'I don't have a record player, but I want to buy a Radiohead record so we can put it on the shelf,'" he says.
It's not a big deal, but it's definitely happening.
More product, less music.
We have people who say, "I don't have a record player".
Not older people, but younger people, late teens, who are just getting excited about it.
Fopp, which now has almost an entire floor devoted to vinyl, has a much more diverse audience when I arrive.
Couples in their 70s, tourists taking photos, teenage boys and middle-aged women.
Although the atmosphere is less relaxed than in the previously mentioned stores - from loudspeakers to Wild Beast's freshly synthesized and sex-fueled pop, rather than improvised jazz - it's great to see a variety of customers.
None of them seem particularly lonely, but the crippling psychological trauma is hard to prove by standing next to someone for 30 seconds.
Elanora, 27, has been walking around Fopp for a few minutes, looking at the various records on sale.
He's out there doing window shopping, not spending a lot of money.
He says he doesn't make much money, so recording isn't really an option.
It's expensive.
It's easy to listen to music on a computer or some other medium, but the beauty of vinyl is... she's in love.
 I don't know how to explain it - it's really unique.
My final stop is said to have sparked a new generation of vinyl lovers: Urban Outfitters.
While I'm trying to make it look like I'm looking at jeans, I'm noticing a group of teenage girls gathered around the Polaroid cameras for a moment before the father and daughter discuss the purchase of a Crosley record player.
On the left is the staircase, and the wall is covered with Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac's records: a mix of contemporary music and classics, the essential records of any average collection.
No one looks at them - perhaps because they are just ornaments, and some are so high that touching them would be impossible.
It's all about the "art vinyl".
But considering that the slightest attention these items get could mean more money for the industry and send some customers to the depths of Soho to pick up more, there's not much to complain about.
It comes as no surprise that the segment of the population that is more likely to have more time and money is also the one that spends the most on luxury goods, such as vinyl records.
But while my findings suggest that the YouGov results are valid at least in Soho's record stores, they don't rule out the large number of female collectors and vinyl lovers that exist in the real world, in record stores and online forums.
These people are likely to be hard workers in school or in the office.
They certainly don't spend their Thursday mornings wandering around Berwick Street's record stores, browsing through records and avoiding the creepy 30-year-old TV presenter as she peers over the shoulders of middle-aged men with no ill will.
The Holker is the longest-living vertebrate - video report
Scientists say that holkers have the longest life span of any vertebrate on the planet.
Julius Nielsen, a researcher of the shark, says that the record is held by a female, believed to be between 272 and 512 years old, and who is five meters long.
French court rejects petition to dismantle shop of Jungle refugee camp
A French court has rejected a request by the Calais authorities to demolish dozens of temporary shops and restaurants in the Jungle camp, which is home to thousands of refugees.
At a court hearing this week, the Calais authorities argued that the state should be able to dismantle a total of 72 temporary shops, where people inside the camp sell goods from cigarettes to energy drinks, offer haircuts or sell tea for 50 cents (40p), or sell simple food for a few euros in temporary restaurants.
The office of the Prefect of Calais argued that the sites should be demolished because they represent a parallel economy without taxes and because they are a fire and clean-up hazard.
The humanitarian groups have told the court that the shops and restaurants are vital, saying that the free meals provided by the state-supported organization and other groups are not providing enough food for the growing number of people in the camp.
They reasoned that convenience stores and restaurants often offer shelter and free meals to those in need.
The court in Lille ruled that there were no legal grounds for evicting 72 people running a temporary shop, but said that the prefect of Calais' concern was "completely understandable".
Judge Jean-François Molla said that the role of food shops, cafes and restaurants was much more important than simply feeding people who were living in "extremely precarious conditions".
He said the facilities provided peaceful meeting places for refugees and volunteers.
One of the sites under demolition was the Jungle Book Kids Cafe, a non-profit organisation that provides 200 meals a day, English and French lessons and shelter for hundreds of vulnerable, lonely minors.
Over 170,000 people have signed a petition to protect the children's cafe.
A letter to the Guardian said that closing the cafe "would be a catastrophe for these children, some of whom are as young as eight".
Two charities, Help Refugees and L'Auberge des Migrants, estimated Friday that the number of people in the Jungle camp has risen to 9,000 - a record high - after the number of arrivals soared during the summer.
Food prices in Finland are falling much faster than the EU average
Food prices in Finland are falling sharply, to the delight of consumers and the displeasure of producers.
The price of food in Finland has fallen by almost 5% in three years, compared with the average fall of 0.9% in the EU.
Meanwhile, in Germany and Sweden, food has become one percent more expensive.
The price of food has fallen in Finland the second-highest in the EU countries with a similar wage level to Finland over the last three years.
Of the comparator countries, only in Britain has the price of food fallen more rapidly than in Finland.
This is stated in an article by the Statistical Office's Head of Development, Ilkka Lehtinen, published on the Tieto & Trendit blog.
Lehtinen compared real prices, i.e. prices which are proportional to the general trend in consumer prices.
The latest data is from June of this year.
In the early 2010s, food prices rose sharply.
In 2013, prices were close to the 1994 price level.
It was alarming.
"We were close to losing the price advantage that came with EU membership", Lehtinen says.
Then came a turn, after which the food has become worse year after year.
The price is now being weighed down by Russia's ban on food imports, which has halted food exports from Finland to Russia.
As a result, the supply of milk and meat products on the Finnish market has increased and the producer prices in agriculture have fallen.
"Putin's policy has helped the Finnish consumer in the short term", Lehtinen says.
The increase in price competition in industry and trade has also contributed to the price decline.
The major supermarket chains S-group and Kesko have both reduced their prices.
The consumer has seen price competition as a form of advertising campaign.
Yet, even though food prices have fallen considerably, Finland is still not a haven for cheap food.
In 2015, food was the fourth most expensive food in Finland among EU countries with similar wage levels to Finland.
According to the newspaper, the value-added tax has a significant impact on the price of food sold in Finland.
He found that if the countries were to have the same VAT rate, Finland would be selling the third cheapest food of similar countries.
The magazine compared Finland with Denmark, Sweden, Austria, France, Italy, Britain, Germany and the Netherlands.
If the VAT rate in the comparable countries were seven, only Germans and Dutchmen would sell cheaper food than Finns.
"If we want to reach the level of the old EU countries in food prices, we must halve the value added tax to the EU average and continue price competition", writes Lehtinen.
Lehtinen points out that his calculations of the VAT rate are indicative.
School isn 't what it used to be .
A returning student may find that the school has changed during the summer.
A new curriculum has been drawn up for schools, which will be implemented in all primary schools at the beginning of the term.
It is the guideline that all Finnish schools follow.
The schools will decide on the details, but the plan will state the official goals.
The new guidelines have been prepared over several years and differ from the old guidelines in many ways.
And among other things, they're going to stop teaching fine writing and start teaching coding in schools.
Swedish is taught at the latest from the sixth grade, and social studies are taught from the fourth grade.
The biggest change, however, is the role of the pupils.
We used to think that the teacher taught the students, but now everyone has to be active and learn from each other.
This is an attempt to make school life more interesting.
The world 's longest-living vertebrate shark has been found . It can live up to 400 years .
The last known Greenland shark (Somniosus microcephalus) does not reach sexual maturity until it is 150 years old.
It can live for another 250 years after that, reports a new study.
The numbers make the species the longest-living vertebrate in the world today.
In terms of animal life, it is surpassed only by the Icelandic ostrich, the oldest known individual of which is dated to 507 years old.
Greenland sharks are swimming across the North Atlantic.
They also hold another record: They are the largest fish in the Arctic.
Females stretch out longer than dogs, growing to over five meters.
Because of their slow growth rate, which is reportedly only about one centimeter a year, adult individuals may have lived for a long time.
But for how long?
Julius Nielsen at the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues found out.
He identified 28 females of adult shark from the fishermen's nets.
The age of the fish was revealed by the radiocarbonisation of the eyelids.
The average lifespan of the sharks studied was found to be at least 272 years.
The two largest fish in the sample, the two-foot-long [493 cm] and the two-foot-long [502 cm] amazon shrimp, turned out to be about 335 and 392 years old.
Since previous studies have shown that the polar bears reach sexual maturity at a height of just over four millimeters, the researchers estimated that they are about 150 years old at that point.
The study was published in Science.
Stockmann fired nearly 300 salesmen. They're not cutting back.
Almost 300 employees will be laid off at the Stockmann department store.
The cooperative companies in the company, which was in difficulty, ended at the beginning of August.
"As a result of the negotiations, approximately 300 jobs will be cut, the bulk of which will be through redundancies", Stockmann said in a statement.
It says that the number of salespeople in the department stores is not reduced to avoid a deterioration in customer service.
In addition, some 80 employees in support functions will be offered new sales positions.
Stockmann's consultations concerned some 3 000 employees.
At the time of the opening of the tender, the number of employees to be reduced was estimated at approximately 380.
The reduction in staff will achieve annual cost savings of around EUR 20 million, which are expected to be achieved in the course of the next year.
Stockmann has already started an efficiency programme which aims to achieve savings of EUR 50 million this year.
The background is Stockmann's difficulties in making a profit from his merchandise business.
Although the group's adjusted operating result improved in the second quarter to EUR 11.1 million, the merchandise trade is still loss-making.
According to Lauri Veijalainen, Stockmann's Deputy Managing Director, sales in department stores have not reached the company's targets.
The Commission has already established that the capital injections in question were granted in the context of the capital injections in question.
The second quarter's improvement in earnings was mainly due to the good performance of the clothing chain Lindex.
The chain achieved its best-ever second quarter sales and earnings.
Lindex's operating profit increased by EUR 9,5 million to EUR 28,1 million.
At the same time last year, the Stockmann Group's operating profit was a loss of 4.1 million.
Stockmann estimates that the group's turnover this year will be lower than last year.
Adjusted operating profit is expected to be slightly positive this year.
Friday will be the northernmost day of the year with temperatures in the mid-to-latitude range.
The low-pressure area over northern Finland will be rainy on Friday, reports HS meteorologist Ilona Láng.
The central part of the country also receives rain showers, but the south is more prone to drought.
The temperature is no longer summer-like, with mercury levels throughout the country below 20 degrees Celsius.
In the northern rain areas, it's going to stay between 10 and 15 degrees.
Kenyan national team is rocked by a doping scandal - a bizarre explanation for the coach's removal
Kenyan gymnastics coach John Anzrah was sent home from the Rio Olympics after it emerged that he had appeared as a national team athlete in a doping test.
The Associated Press reports that the athlete Anzrah was trying to perform for is the 800-meter star Ferguson Rotich.
Kenyan national team manager Stephen Arap Soi said Anzrah's identity was revealed after she gave a surprise sample of Rotichina in a test.
The doping agents went to Anzrah to inform the authorities.
Anzrah was sent home, So said, because he "committed a crime against the Kenyan national team".
He acted like a sportsman, gave a urine sample, even signed documents.
We cannot accept this kind of behaviour", Kenya's Olympic Committee chairman Kip Keino told Reuters news agency.
The Olympic athletics competition starts on Friday, and Rotichin is scheduled to run right then.
It is not yet known whether the runner is aware of the consequences of the incident.
Rotich finished fourth in the road race at the world championships last year and is already a favorite to win in Rio.
Reuters reported that a source within the Kenyan track and field team claimed that Anzrah used the athlete's accreditation card to get free meals in the race village.
When the anti-doping officials saw him, they assumed he was an athlete and they took him for a test.
The coach didn't explain the situation to officials because he was afraid of being exposed", the source said.
Where is everybody?
The empty stadium in Rio is overwhelming
Where is everybody?
Certainly not at the Rio Olympic Stadium to watch the athletics.
On Friday, the Olympic Games began in Rio de Janeiro, where the world's top athletes were able to show off their skills to a bewildered, empty audience.
Rio organizers said Friday that only 58 percent of the tickets for the first day's morning games and 65 percent of the tickets for the evening games have been sold.
The second was four years ago in London, where the stadium was teeming with cheering crowds.
The tickets for the finals are already sold out in Rio.
The Rio Olympics' crowds have already attracted attention before the Games.
For example, thousands of empty benches have been seen in the rugby, canoeing, and horseback-riding arenas.
When Brazil's two great talents, Talita Antunes and Larissa Franca, played beach volleyball at the legendary Copacabana, the audience was only 70 percent full.
After the Brazilian duo, the Netherlands played Russia, and the 12,000-seater stadium was only about 30 percent full.
The bad news is at least explained by the fact that Brazil, which is struggling with economic difficulties, is far from European and Asian sports tourists, and many Olympic sports are foreign to Brazilians who are used to football.
True, even the first match of the Brazilian soccer team did not fill the watered-down soccer stadium.
Mario Andrada, spokesman for the race organizers, said over the weekend that 82 percent of the tickets had been sold by then, a significant decrease from four years ago.
"There are still 1.1 million left to be sold", Andrada said, according to Reuters.
Of the 8.5 million tickets sold for the London Olympics, 8.2 million were sold, although the tickets cost nearly half as much as those for Rio.
In Rio, ticket prices have ranged from about nine euros to over a thousand euros for the first time.
More than half of the tickets are under $16.
At the London Olympics, volunteers and military personnel were allowed to sit in empty seats, but this is not yet allowed in Rio, as the organizers need money and are trying to sell tickets until the last minute.
In Rio, though, organizers have given 240,000 tickets to schoolchildren for less-known sports in the country, such as golf and rugby.
There were plenty of empty seats at Rio's stadium this morning.
Even beach volleyball on the sands of Copacabana has not been a big hit with the public.
Jukka Keskisalo competed in the London 2012 Olympics, where she won the silver medal.
I've had enough of people with the papers.
A new way to protect nature - acquire land rights
The Helsinki Foundation is contributing to nature conservation in new ways.
The foundation, which was set up last year, acquires ecologically important nature reserves.
Thereafter, individuals, companies and entities may redeem the right of tenure to the land with money.
The Foundation has acquired its first land in Lapland.
The land is divided into virtual blocks, which can be acquired by anyone who wishes to acquire the right of ownership against payment.
The holder has a veto over his 187 square block, which means that in practice, no approval from each holder is required if the land is to be reused.
The right to purchase shares may also be acquired for more than one block.
The acquisition of custody is something tangible that can be bequeathed or be given as a gift.
There is no need to go out and carry banners or to chain oneself to something to protect nature", Juha Leviekangas, who has acquired the right to manage his company, argues.
The acquisition of the right of administration gives precise location information about the block, which allows, for example, a visit to the block.
The Foundation's website has the names of the holders of the land rights on the same map as the land block data.
The only risk Leviäkangas sees in his conservation acquisition is that the Foundation's operations will change from their original idea.
The Helsinki Foundation is a public-benefit foundation whose purpose is to promote the protection of the environment and nature.
There is a risk that the Foundation might act in a way that is unethical or commercial, but that shouldn't be possible.
The basic idea of the Helsinki Foundation's Haltija project is to protect natural areas so that they can be untouched and in peace.
The Foundation acquires land either by purchase or by donation.
It finances its activities mainly by the sale of the holding rights, but the foundation has received its initial capital from its founders.
The Foundation's purpose is to acquire more protected lands.
It is also aiming beyond the borders of Finland and is planning to import from Australia.
The Helsinki Foundation will present its activities at the pop-up forest in Helsinki's shopping district from 13 to 19 August.
The biggest cities are raided by bike thieves . Turku is the worst . Look at your home town .
Of the major cities in Finland, bicycle theft is the biggest problem in Turku.
More bicycles have been stolen there this year, relative to the population, than in nine other major cities.
Based on the reported bicycle thefts, Helsinki Herald found out how many bicycles and their parts per thousand inhabitants were stolen in the ten largest cities in January-August of this year.
In addition to Turku, Helsinki, Oulu and Lahti also topped the list.
According to police data, there were four to five bicycle thefts per 1,000 residents.
In contrast, in Espoo and Kouvola, only about two bicycle thefts per thousand inhabitants were reported to the police.
There's a big difference.
"In other cities, theft is twice as high as in other cities", says Police Commissioner Tommi Reen of the Police Department.
I'm gonna have the police wondering why the city is at the top of the rankings.
It is extremely difficult to say why more bicycles are stolen in Turku than elsewhere.
I don't have an answer for that.
"The prevalence of theft can be influenced by the amount of cycling in the city and the number of bicycles in general", reflects Sergeant Teemu Äikäs.
Tommi Reen, the director of the Police Department, is quite expecting Turku, Helsinki and Oulu to take the lead in the comparison.
The rate of bicycle theft is largely determined by the cities of study and bicycle use.
Turku has a tight centre, short distances and plenty of wheels for thieves.
"Espoo, for example, is a different kind of city, with city centres far apart and the bicycle not necessarily the primary means of transport", says Reen.
In January-August, the number of reported bicycle thefts has been slightly lower than in the corresponding period last year.
But there's no reason for great joy.
Despite the downward trend of recent years, police are reporting just over 20,000 bicycle thefts annually.
That's 50 to 60 bicycles a day and in Helsinki alone, about 4,000 a year.
"They are large amounts", Reen says.
In reality, the thieves take more than bicycles, since only a fraction of the victims report the theft to the police.
Reen urges people to file a police report for bicycle theft, even though less than one in ten reported cases are solved.
A typical bike theft that's solved is one where the police get a report of the theft right away and the thief gets caught red-handed.
"Cases are also discovered in other investigations, such as when stolen bicycles are found in a drug case", Reen explains.
In Helsinki, bicycle thieves are caught every week either for the crime itself or during police investigations, says senior constable Timo Leppämäki.
He says that bicycles are stolen from, for example, shopping malls' bicycle racks, courtyards, warehouses, and bicycle lockers - practically anywhere they are usually stored.
The most commonly stolen individual bike models are Jopo, as in previous years.
The U-lock gives the bike better protection than many other locks.
Some thieves take the bicycle for short-term personal use, for example, but a large proportion of the bicycles stolen end up being sold, for example, via the Internet.
They're staying in the domestic market.
"At least the police have not been made aware of the fact that many stolen bicycles go abroad", says Reen.
The buyers of the stolen bikes are ordinary Finns, according to the police.
I'm sure some of them buy stolen bikes without even knowing it.
Some might have doubts about that.
A second-hand bicycle buyer must be careful, for he may be guilty of concealment or trespassing.
"Alarm bells should ring when a good bike is sold at a clear discount", says Reen.
Severi Hirvi, a special bookworker, carries his colorful Nopsa with him every day during his work at the Kallio library in Helsinki.
He has had five bicycles, but none has been stolen, says Hirvi. "No one has ever been stolen, so a good monk has been there".
"Maybe this isn't so attractive to thieves, it doesn't have to be hipster-ish", thinks Hirvi from Helsinki.
In a kiosk in Kallio, Helsinki, Siiri Valve, who had been in a hurry to get home, locked his bicycle with a small U-lock.
Now, the bike was against the wall of the kiosk, but usually Valve locks his bike into something solid, like a bicycle rack.
"It's a lot to think about, because this is the most expensive bike I've ever owned", says a student from Helsinki about his white bicycle, which cost about $500 (U.S.) to build.
"I keep hearing from my friends that the bikes have been taken".
"Mostly bad wheels, like those bum-ass-ass-guys".
The bike was stolen from the Watch itself in the backyard of the housing company a year ago.
The bike had not been locked, though, so Valve knew to expect it to be impounded.
You mean, under 15 years old?
Helsinki tries a similar flying crew as in the USA
In Helsinki, the so-called peer review committee is being tested to prevent young people from becoming involved in criminal activity.
The experiment will initially be applied to those under 15 years of age, who will now be exempt from criminal liability.
The bench crew intervenes in the first crime committed by a young man.
The idea is that the peer review board discusses the crime that has occurred with the perpetrator and imposes a sanction.
A week later, the offender can join the bench to make amends.
Other consequences may include a letter to the family explaining what has been done and what has been learned.
Tommi Laitio, the youth coordinator, says that the model is not strict.
We have other mediation models that run in parallel.
"Everyone is directing the young person's actions in a more responsible direction so that everything doesn't go to waste with the first mistake", Laitio says.
The US model is widely used in the US.
The idea is that the youth, after his first crime, does not face an adult panel but reflects on what happened with people of his or her age.
The model has been tried once.
Palmu service designer Iikka Lovio, who was with the service design agency that monitored the experiment, says that it was an assault that was successfully solved.
In particular, first offences committed by persons under 15 years of age may not have been dealt with at all before.
"It's been a message to continue on the path you've chosen", Lovio says.
The peer review team is part of the Immigrant Youth Helsinki project, which is supported by the City of Helsinki and the Me Foundation.
The Commission is also proposing that the European Parliament and the Council should be consulted on the future of the EU's asylum policy.
More than 70 Republican influencers want the party to stop funding the Trump campaign.
More than 70 influential Republicans are said to have signed a letter asking the party to stop funding Donald Trump's presidential campaign.
The letter was reported by the U.S. newspaper Politico, which had obtained a copy of the draft.
The newspaper said the open letter was addressed to Reince Priebus, chairman of the Republican National Committee.
The signatories want the party's funds to be directed to the congressional elections instead of the Trump campaign.
"We believe that the dissent caused by Donald Trump, along with his recklessness, incompetence and record-breaking unpopularity, threatens to bring a vote boom to the Democrats in this election", the letter says, according to Politico.
Only the directing of all available resources to the congressional elections can prevent the Republicans from drowning in the Trump-decoration anchor around their necks.
The letter said the decision should not be difficult, as Trump's chances of winning the presidential election are diminishing by the day.
Politico says the letter is due to be sent within the next week.
Among the signatories are politicians Gordon Humphrey, Chris Shays, Tom Coleman and Vin Weber.
One of the people who organized the letter is the outspoken anti-Trump Republican Andrew Weinstein.
According to Politico, Weinstein has said that the letter comes from "people who want the party to protect their majority in Congress" and that it is not about endorsing anyone.
The letter lists several actions by Donald Trump that are believed to have offended millions of voters.
He is also said to have displayed dangerous authoritarian tendencies.
Earlier this week, 50 officials working with the National Security Council announced in an open letter that they would not support Donald Trump for president.
Clinton promises relief for families with children in the United States .
In the United States, Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton gave details of her economic policy on Thursday night.
I'm running for president so that the American economy can be good for everyone.
"Donald Trump is running for president so that the economy will work for him and his friends", Clinton said in his speech.
At the heart of the Clinton plan is a massive, $275 billion, five-year program to improve America's infrastructure - roads, bridges, airports.
This would be financed partly by tax increases from the rich, partly by private money.
The building program is a show of support for the hard-working Americans who suffered when factories were moved to the land of cheap labor.
Clinton called the program the biggest investment in high-paying jobs since World War II.
We are the building king, we must return to building!
Clinton said it.
On Thursday, Clinton also promised to make it easier for working families with children.
On Thursday, he sounded like Sanders, anyway, when he emphasized that the rich should pay their fair share of taxes.
And if a company leaves the United States as a tax-refugee, it has to pay exit tax, Clinton said.
He is now opposed to the Pacific Free Trade Agreement, which he once supported.
"[As president] I will oppose any trade agreement that works against workers or wages", Clinton promised.
Speculation in The Washington Post published before Clinton's speech suggested that Clinton was going to criticize Republican Donald Trump's economic program announced Monday, saying it "only favors millionaires like this".
Clinton has previously called Trump's proposed sweeping corporate tax cut "the Trump loophole".
On Thursday, Clinton emphasized that she herself is the daughter of a small business owner.
He reminded listeners of the small business owners whose bills Trump has failed to pay and the clothing that Trump himself makes in China and Mexico.
"If he wants to make America great again, he should start by making products in America himself", Clinton quipped.
The following are the ratings for Rio: The Finns have not been glued to the boxes by the Kites, but the mobile application is interesting
Sports shoes are usually seen in television viewership statistics as the sharpest peaks of a mountain.
The Rio Olympics have so far failed to reach the big screen.
The Games have attracted a maximum of 12% of the population at any one time: the swimming on Tuesday evening was followed by 615,000 viewers on the Yellen Olympic Channel on TV2 at the same time.
For comparison, the European Championships in Athletics held a month ago attracted almost 800 000 TV2 viewers at one time, and the European Championships in football attracted well over 2 million.
The biggest draws so far have been the Sunday night cycling and the opening ceremony of the fifth day of the Games, both of which reached almost half a million viewers on the Olympic Channel.
The Commission is also proposing to extend the scope of the directive to include the use of the word 'eco-friendly' in the word 'eco-friendly'.
In addition to television, the Finnish people follow the Olympic Games from the Rio Arena.
We are pleased with the number of people who watch the Olympics on television.
In the television sector, viewership is also divided between TV2 and Yle Fem.
The Rio Olympics are the first sporting event to which Yle has dedicated an entire channel.
When you have a 24-hour broadcast, and you have a viewing rate of 20,000 to 500,000 people, that's a good basis.
The viewership is lower than in the 2012 London Games or the 2008 Beijing Games, but the difference is partly explained by the time difference - a large part of the Rio Games broadcasts comes to Finland at night.
The second reason for the lack of interest - if anyone now thinks it is lazy - is surely the traditional Finnish reason: if Finland had taken someone's surprise medal from the preliminary round, the interest would have bounced up with it.
In addition, the sport of general athletics is just beginning, as are other sports of interest to Finns: sailing and horse riding.
The initial viewership has been closer to what we expected, according to Pokkine.
When the public athletics show up, the ratings will go through the roof.
Yle launched the mobile application Yle Rio 2016 for the games, which became the most downloaded free application in Finland in the first days of the games in Apple's App Store.
By Monday, the app had been downloaded 150,000 times.
I'd say we're about 200,000 downloads in now.
"We will not get the network's viewership figures until later"., Pokkinen says
The Rio Arena has not been operating as desired for all users.
Pokkinen says that the feedback has been received and the error has been corrected.
There's been a delay in the Rio Arena's launch and another minor technical problem in the early stages.
The applications have been updated and should correct the errors.
The Rio Olympics will be seen on the Yle channel and in the arena more than any other sporting event ever before.
Some sports can be followed on the Yle Fem channel, and the radio Yle Puhe broadcasts the games daily.
The Olympics are not only perhaps the busiest on Yle ever, they are also the last to be followed only by the Yle canals.
As of 2018, Olympic sports will be shown on both the public and commercial channels.
How deep is the deepest lake in Finland?
According to official statistics, the deepest lake in Finland is Päijänne, which is located on the island of Rist Island, at 95.3 meters.
It could be even deeper.
Technical diving instructor Matti Kannela found a depression of about 20 square meters at Ristisel, the depth of which the diving computer indicated as 104 meters.
In the summer of 2014, the Finnish Environment Agency tried in vain to confirm the observation by sonography.
The method may not detect a small depression at 100 meters, says Jari Hakala, a development engineer.
So for now, the official depth is still 315 feet [95.3 m].
Other deep lakes are Inarijärvi (92 m) and Suvasvesi (90 m).
The Saimaa, Toisvesi and Head Lakes are more than 80 metres long.
They haven't been studied as closely as the sunflower.
Especially the bottom of Lake Inari has not been mapped accurately.
"There may well be unknown deep-sea routes", Kannela muses.
If the deepest lake is defined by mean depth, it is the Great Salt Lake, 75 feet [23 m].
From this point of view, the Day of the Dead is not among the ten deepest, and the River of the Sword is even further from the top.
Corrected August 12 at 2:29 pm: Corrected the last paragraph, where the deepest lakes were wrong at the center.
Taxation of the elderly: Increased taxation of pensioners
The taxation of pensioners is still more stringent than that of employees.
Ihalainen says that the issue came to light during the parliamentary elections and that the taxation of pensioners was promised to be equal to that of employees.
The government's proposal doesn't include any of this.
We think it should definitely be there.
The promises made should be kept after the elections, he told Wester Media.
Earlier this year, workers received a tax break that reduced their tax liability.
The matter was heated up in Parliament by the opposition representatives who criticised the then Minister of Finance, Alexander Stubb (above) for his election promises.
The purchasing power is protected, it does not increase
The Minister of Finance Petteri Orpo (Sr.) said that the tax reductions policy presented by Ihalaisen was mainly about safeguarding purchasing power and not about increasing it, as there will be no wage increases next year.
He says that tax cuts have a positive effect on purchasing power and employment, if other things do not add to people's insecurity.
The Commission is also concerned that the EU is not able to take action on the issue of the EU's own resources.
He says that keeping the deal is important for credibility.
It is the most important economic and employment policy measure of the government's term.
It is a decision which has been taken by the forces of the labour market, and it should not be undermined by any questioning.
It is becoming necessary because the economy is so dependent on domestic demand and people's own beliefs about the future.
The long-term unemployed in the sleeper
The Commission is also proposing to set up a European network of experts to help the Commission and the Member States in the fight against fraud.
The number of long-term unemployed in June was about 17 000 more than a year earlier.
He says that if growth does not stop, the government's target of raising the employment rate to 72 percent will be missed.
He warns that if the challenge of prolonged unemployment is ignored, a very great social toll is in store.
Ambassador: No Finnish victims known to have been involved in the Thai attacks
In Thailand, last night and last night, at least four people were killed in a series of bombings.
The Embassy urges Finnish citizens to be vigilant and avoid the busiest tourist areas and to follow the instructions of the authorities.
The EU is also working to improve the quality of life in the country by providing a better understanding of the causes of death and the consequences of the disease.
Very few Finns in Thailand
According to Westphalen, there are very few Finns in Thailand at present, although their exact numbers are difficult to estimate.
The Finnish tourist season in Thailand is scheduled for the turn of the year.
Most of the tourists to Thailand come from Southern Europe and China at this time of year.
The Finnish Embassy has received some comments from Finns in Thailand via Facebook after the bombings.
The Embassy has tried to reach out to Finnish people in Hua Hin in particular to get information about the situation in the city.
However, several of our contacts in Hua Hin are out of town at the moment.
In general, everything seems to be fine, Westphalen says.
No record of the perpetrator
Westphalen says the perpetrator of the attacks is still unknown.
The ambassador believes the events may be linked to political unrest in a divided Thai society and last week's referendum on a constitution drafted by the military junta.
The law was approved in a referendum.
The coup was not an open, democratic process.
Among other things, the country arrested people who declared opposition to the law.
In the southernmost provinces of Thailand, however, ethno-national conflict involving the Muslim population is raging, Westphalen says.
The Muslims want to increase their autonomy.
However, in the past, attacks have not been directed at tourist sites.
There's a big local celebration in Bangkok today, Westphalen said.
He says the town is celebrating the Queen's birthday and Mother's Day.
There's very little traffic in the city.
The impact on the day's progress has made the authorities very particular about security.
Thai Police: Attacks not related to international terrorism
Police say the attacks are "local sabotage" and are different from the usual terrorist attacks.
Islamic terrorism has also been ruled out, according to the Thai police news agency AP.
In Thailand, at least four people have been killed in the past 24 hours as 11 bombs exploded in various parts of the country, including tourist hotspots in Phuket and Hua Hin.
Four bombs exploded overnight on the Finnish holiday island of Phuket, a popular tourist destination, reports the Bangkok Post, a newspaper in Thailand.
According to the current information, there were no fatalities.
Two of the bombs went off, according to the newspaper, on Patong Beach.
In addition, two bombs exploded in Phang Nga, where one person was injured, according to the newspaper.
In Hua Hin, a popular tourist destination, a total of four bombs have been detonated yesterday and today, according to local authorities.
In both twin bombings, at least one person was killed.
In addition, in the southern Thai village of Surat Than and the city of Trang, at least one bomb exploded in each of them.
At least one person was killed in each of the attacks.
Surat Thani is also known to many travelers, as it is the gateway to the holiday islands of Ko Samui, Ko Pha Ngan and Ko Tao.
The attackers are unknown .
According to Prayut Chan-O-Chan, the head of the military junta that rules Thailand, the perpetrator of the attacks is still unknown.
The bombs are an attempt to create chaos and confusion.
We shouldn't be encouraging people to get more banged up, he told reporters.
According to Gen Prawit Wongsuwan, the Deputy Prime Minister in charge of security, at least Hua Hin and Trang's attacks are linked.
He told Thai BSB that the perpetrators have been intent on destroying the country's tourism industry, as all attacks have occurred in tourist destinations.
The Embassy of Finland urges Finns in the country to be vigilant and to avoid the busiest tourist areas and to follow the instructions of the authorities.
The EU is also committed to the development of a comprehensive and integrated approach to the fight against terrorism, and to the fight against money laundering.
In the wounded Europeans
Very little is known about the attacks that occurred during the night in Finland and their victims.
We've had a little more time to get a handle on last night's attack on Hua Hin.
A local woman was killed and more than 20 others were injured, including at least nine foreign tourists.
Among the wounded are at least Germans, Italians, Dutch and Austrians.
In the second attack, at least three people were wounded.
Two bombs exploded near a famous landmark, the clock tower.
Thai PBS reports that police have sealed off an area in Hua Hin where they believe they have found another bomb.
The Surat Than bomb was hidden in a flower bed, according to the provincial governor.
A municipal worker was killed in the attack.
There's at least one wounded.
The police chief, who was interviewed by CNN, said that two bombs were used in the Surat Than attack, which exploded about every half hour.
According to the Bangkok Post, the bombs exploded in front of two different police stations.
The United States of America won the women's fours.
Alexandra Raisman of the United States was second with 60,098 points and Alija Mustafina of Russia was third with 58,665 points.
Biles, 18, is still aiming for the pole vault championships in the Rio Games in the perm, the jump and the pole vault.
Biles has been dominating women's gymnastics for the last few years.
He's got eight individual world championships from the previous three seasons.
He has won the fours and the perm championships three times in a row and the puym in the last and second years.
As a member of the U.S. team, Biles has won two team world championships.
Biles has a lot of money and a lot of money in his damn World Cup medals.
Finnish entrepreneur in Thailand: "The weather has no effect on tourism"
Esa Huovila, who runs a real estate agency in Phuket, Thailand, and a children's playground on the same property, is not worried about the impact of the bombings in Thailand on tourism.
If there are no more attacks, I do not think there will be any more surprises, says Huovila, a Finnish entrepreneur who has worked in Asia for some twenty years.
An experienced entrepreneur, he has seen many of the tragedies that have befallen Thailand.
There's always something.
First there was the tsunami, then the bird flu, and last year, the bombing in Bangkok.
If these trips haven't turned away tourists before, this one probably won't.
The Huovila company's office is located a few hundred meters from the explosion site.
The housekeeper heard about the attack from one of his employees.
The employee called around 9:00 a.m. local time and said not to come to the office.
Huovila says that both the beach street and the main street Bangla Road were completely closed early in the morning due to the strikes.
Many of my local employees came to work this morning as usual.
They thought the roadblocks were put up for the Queen's birthday, Huovila says, referring to Friday, a holiday in Thailand.
The atmosphere at Patong was calm, and the main street movements were allowed to open at about ten o'clock local time.
On the beach, not many people had even heard of the attacks.
By 3:30 p.m., traffic had returned to normal and most shops had opened.
Judging by the location of the blast, the explosion was quite small, Huovila, who was at the scene, said.
The car in question was later seen in the Crown Estate on the Jouxholm Road.
When the police arrived, the car was set on fire.
The pair spotted two men matching the description hiding in a nearby bush.
The second man was caught right away.
The other escaped, but the man was later found in the woods by a police dog.
The men are suspected of theft of a motor vehicle, theft and gross damage.
The police are thanking the people who gave them the information.
Research director on Russian leadership changes: clear displacement
Russia's most senior leadership change in years took place on Friday, when President Vladimir Putin fired his chief of staff, Sergei Ivanov.
Ivanov's successor is Anton Vaino, 44, of Estonian descent.
He's an ex-diplomat who's been Ivanov's number two.
Kangaspuro says the reason for Ivanov's removal may be Putin's desire to prevent the powerful people around him from gaining too much power.
He adds that the rotation of leadership positions is one way of abusing power.
This is a way to stop people from claiming power independent of the president.
The leak also suggests that Ivanov may have gotten into a fight with other executives or messed up.
The fall of Ivanov
Ivanov, a member of Putin's inner circle, will be assigned to special duties in the environment and transportation departments.
In a video released by state media, Putin said the change was a joint decision.
According to Putin, Ivanov himself had requested the transfer to other positions and suggested Peron as his replacement, Russia Today reported.
Mr. Kangaspuro says that from Ivanov's perspective, this is a clear demotion.
Environmental and transport issues are not very high in the order of priority in Russia.
He points out that Ivanov has been one of the most important people at the peak of Russian power.
Ivanov has also played a prominent role in the President's Security Council.
Ivanov worked with Putin in the Soviet Union, in the KGB.
He was considered a potential successor to Putin in 2008, but Dmitri Medvedev became president.
Kangaspuro points out that old ways, such as governors, have been replaced in Russia recently.
Senior researcher Katri Pynnöniemi of the Institute of Foreign Policy says that more interesting than the heir to Ivanov's throne is that Putin is replacing his inner circle with a younger one.
ISIS fighters used civilians as human shields as they retreated from Syria
They used civilians as human shields when they fled to the town of Jarabulus so that we would not target them", said Sherfan Darwish, a representative of the Manbij Military Council.
According to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, hundreds of civilians were placed in vehicles and taken to Jarabulus.
Last week, Arab and Kurdish fighters took over about 90 percent of the city of Manbij, which is important to ISIS.
But it's estimated that dozens of jihadists remained in the city.
Corrected previous news at 7:30 p.m.: Earlier we incorrectly reported that civilians were fleeing the city, in fact ISIS fighters were kidnapping civilians as they fled the city.
Professor , the Home Office 's document disclosure policy is illegal .
The Ministry of the Interior's policy on the public disclosure of documents is illegal, says Tomi Voutilainen, a professor of public law at the University of Eastern Finland.
Voutilainen told STT that the public access to documents cannot be based on the authorities' own policies but is based on the law.
The Ministry of the Interior had previously refused to release the list of participants in the Ministry of the Interior's events to Ilta-Sanom.
The Ministry of Finance justified the decision by the instructions of the Cabinet and by the fact that the information was recorded in the Ministry's calendar and not in the accounting records.
The Ministry's communications director tells STT that the Ministry has identified a need to reform its practices.
Usain Bolt's last Olympic show is starting in Rio.
As in previous years, Bolt has been racing against time under the title.
He was injured in the first quarter of his career and had to miss the Jamaican Olympic trials.
It hasn't been the perfect preparation, but I'm in much better shape.
"I've been practicing well, and that's the key", Bolt said at a press conference in Rio.
That press conference included underdressed samba dancers and reporters who had become fans.
The controversy surrounding Bolt underscores the fact that the Jamaican star has emerged in an era when public sports have struggled with doping scandals and waning interest.
Bolt's previous Olympic loss came in Athens 2004, when he finished first in the 200-meter dash with a time of 21.05.
At the time, 17-year-old Bolt was a young prospect who was slowed by injuries and a loose training posture.
Four years later, in Beijing, his reign began with a 100-meter dash, which broke the world record and the confidence of the competitors despite the final celebration of a time of 9.69.
This is harder .
A year later, at the World Championships in Berlin, Bolt reached the pinnacle of his career by the time.
The world records set in Berlin for 9.58 meters (100 yards) and 19.19 yards (2200 feet) are still in force.
In Rio, Bolt has announced that he is going for the world record for the 200 meters and the 19-second time-out, but no one believes it will be born except Bolt himself.
In the 100 Bolt's toughest challenger is the 2004 Athens Olympic winner in the 100 Justin Gatlin.
Last year in the World Cup final in Beijing, Bolt beat an American by just one hundredth of a second.
Bolt has never lost a final in the Beijing-based competition, if he ever made it there.
In the 2011 100m final at the Daegu World Championships, Bolt was forced to sit out of the race due to a misjudged lap.
Bolt's turning 30 in a week.
He's an old man in a young man's race, and the Rio Games are his last Olympics.
As the final goal, Bolt has set the stage for next year's World Cup in London.
These are the Olympics that set me apart from the others.
I'm older, and this is harder.
But every time I'm down, I remind myself, this year I have to do it, Bolt said three months ago in an interview with Sports Illustrated.
Riot leaks: two athletes suspected of doping offences
According to China's state news agency Xinhua, Chinese swimmer Chen Xinyi, 18, tested positive for doping at the Rio Olympics.
The Chinese drug lord Chen Xiny's doping test showed traces of banned substances.
The Bulgarian athlete Silvia Danekova is also suspected of doping.
In addition, a Kenyan athletics coach was banned from the country for giving a doping test on behalf of an athlete.
Silvia Danekova has provided a doping sample with traces of the hormone epo.
She finished fourth in the women's 100 meter butterfly in Rio.
According to the Brazilian newspaper Estadão, the Chinese swimmer has taken his doping case to the Court of Arbitration for Sport.
Xinhua reports that a sample Xiny gave on Sunday would have been found to contain traces of a diuretic called hydrochlorothiazide.
Other suspected doping cases have also surfaced in Rio.
The BBC reports that Bulgarian female sprinter Silvia Danekova has tested positive for a doping test that contains traces of the hormone epo.
Kenya has sent Rio's athletics coach home for a doping violation.
The International Olympic Committee said on Thursday that a Kenyan coach had posed as an athlete in a test case and had provided a doping sample for the case.
Media reports indicate that the man in question is Kenyan sprint coach John Anzrah.
According to the Daily Mail, he had used the race bag of Ferguson Rotich, a runner who had run the 800 meters.
Phelps is not gonna stop until historical gold is in show business .
The most successful athlete in Olympic history, the American Michael Phelps, swam in the 200-meter medley, his 22nd Olympic title in Rio.
Michael Phelps has won 22 Olympic gold medals.
Samalla Phelps became the first swimmer to win Olympic gold in the same discipline in four consecutive events.
Phelps' winning time was 1.54.66.
Japan's Hagino Kosuke was second in the mixed doubles, ahead of China's Shun Wang.
I'm just trying to have a little fun, says Helen Skelton, the BBC's Olympic commentator, laughing in a quick interview on the evening news.
The story about Helen Skelton (a.k.a.
Next to him is the commentator Rebecca Adlington.
Skelton will not be much stressed if there is a slight rumor in the press or the British press about his revealing and special outfits.
Television is a visual medium, he's pushing.
Skelton is wearing high-heeled shoes and a short-sleeve dress, which I'm sure is at least revealing enough - at least to many conservative British viewers.
But no backtracking is allowed.
It's important to look good, and small breasts are just fun.
I'm sure Skelton wants to be funny and maybe even funny, but he insists he doesn't want to be the lead.
"This isn't about me", he says.
We're here to watch sports, and the focus should be on the athletes.
It shouldn't matter so much what I wear.
Can you imagine that the rumor has reached Finland?
I can't, but anything that draws attention to how hard these swimmers work and how much they sacrifice is okay with me, Skelto chuckles.
You know what, man?
It's a noise from nothing if it's from the (director's) clothes.
I'm a little amused if one of these has hit someone's radar.
The police in Rio arrested two people on terrorism charges .
Rio police announced on Thursday that they have arrested two people on suspicion of terrorism.
The arrests were made by the police during the security of the games.
The police made five other arrests and interrogated two persons before releasing them.
All the suspects have been Brazilian.
According to the G1 news website, the individuals arrested for terrorism belong to the same group whose members were arrested by the police in July.
The suspects are believed to have ties to the Islamic State militant group.
The detainees were known to have incited violence on social media.
Messages promoting violence were distributed on popular messaging services such as WhatsApp.
The Rio Games are run by 85,000 police officers.
Police in Rio have detonated a suspicious package
Spain and Nigeria were forced to start their preliminary match in an empty stadium on Thursday for the Rio basketball tournament.
Police found a suspicious package at the basketball court and closed it to the public.
The police let the public in after they had controlled the detonation of the package.
This was the third time during the Rio Olympics that the police had carried out a controlled explosion mission.
The police have closed the arena because of a suspicious package found there.
The crowd was allowed in after the police had controlled the explosion of the package.
The crowd was not able to enter the arena by the time the match began because the police had temporarily closed the arena due to a suspicious package found in the hall.
The police detonated the package and then let the crowd into the hall.
The Spanish team, who had started the race sleepy, was awakened by a bang.
Spain, who had started the competition with two losses, beat Nigeria 96-87.
In the two previous races, Spain took silver.
The police conducted a controlled explosion mission for the third time during the summer games in Rio.
The last time the police had to blow up a suspicious find near a cross-country bike landing last Saturday.
Spain and Nigeria started their preliminary round match of the Rio Basketball Tournament in front of empty seats.
Argentine lady knocked off the Siren of the Deceiver - Finnish protest
The Wind-up Siren had a colorful day of competition in Rio.
The winds were strong on Thursday.
The Argentine lady knocked off the Wind Cheater Siren on Thursday at the opening of the women's surfing day in Rio.
The wind was clearly broken.
The defendant admitted to the crime.
He was trapped because of the accident, and the others ran away, said the head coach of Finland Joakim Wilenius.
The athlete thought long and hard about the protest.
It was not worth doing, because it would have been useless according to the Olympic rules.
I should have fallen in the water to be compensated, the Deceiver Siren said.
The Finn hung on his board until the last one because he didn't want to get into the dirty water of the Rio.
The Finnish driver was 27th in the race when he crashed.
In the overall standings, the London 2012 Olympic silver medalist is eighth.
As far as the bodies go, the crash had little effect.
Friday is the big day, with the 10th and 12th races.
Unlike the first report, the Siren of the Deceiver did not protest.
7 Special Things That Science Says Will Extend Your Life
Science has explored all the possibilities between earth and heaven.
These things have been proven to add years to a person's life.
Some things are habits that directly or indirectly affect a person's health so that his life is prolonged.
At other times, things beyond a person's control can add years to his life.
These include a tendency to gain body mass or social status.
Regular shopping can prolong life.
You don't have to go to the store to get a milk carton.
The mystery of a long age has been solved by many different studies.
The Daily Medical has presented seven of the most bizarre findings of the study.
Science suggests that all of these things may add years to your life.
Drinking beer and coffee
Coffee juice has been shown to protect against some cancers, type 2 diabetes, and Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease.
A Harvard University study found that moderate coffee consumption is linked to "reduced risk of death", especially from neurological or heart disease.
Alcohol is also supported by research that suggests that binge drinking - from one to three drinks a day - may extend life.
For example, one observed that drinkers of wine lived longer than people who did not drink at all.
Regular use of dental floss can extend a person's life by as much as six years, according to one study.
The claim is based on the fact that this prevents inflammation of the gums.
They can, in turn, contribute to the outbreak of other diseases elsewhere in the human body.
A study in Norway looked at how laughter affects life expectancy.
The seven-year project monitored more than 54,000 people.
Those who laughed more were the more grumpy individuals with 35 percent more chance of surviving the test.
Sex, when taken in consideration, is good for health, according to many studies.
Besides, it can also prolong life.
Unfortunately, just having sex as such is not enough.
To add years to a person's life, he must also have an orgasm.
Of course, the traffic will add years, there is no denying that.
But longevity does not require absolute health.
A study at Oxford University found that women with large butts had lower cholesterol levels.
They also had more omega-3 fatty acids in their bodies.
The same study linked these factors to low mortality.
Whether an Olympic medalist or an Oscar-winning actor, he is more likely to live longer than the average bull.
Many studies have tried to find the cause of this phenomenon.
One explanation may be that an ambitious person is likely to live in a way that will add years to his life.
Some researchers, however, suspect that longevity is due to a person's social status - which in turn makes it possible to seek such accolades as the Nobel Prize.
A study of shopping habits among people over 65 found that a person who shopped daily was less likely to survive as a parent who shopped.
This is because spinning in concrete shops reduces loneliness.
It has also been found to trigger biological mechanisms that may cause premature death.
So take your credit card out of your hand - online gambling, therefore, will not have the same effect.
A drunken driver slammed into a truck .
On Friday night, a serious truck and a car collided in the middle of the road in Varsinais-Suomenki.
The accident happened in the middle of Kosk, between Koskenti and Sorvastonti on Friday at 9 pm.
The truck had been driving towards Forssa when an oncoming passenger car had driven into the same lane, hitting the right-hand corner of the truck.
The truck was left upright on the track after the collision, but it caught fire.
The driver managed to extinguish the fire himself.
The car slid into the ditch and then across the ditch to its roof.
A woman born in 1972 driving a passenger car was trapped in her car.
The injured driver was removed from the car by the ambulance service and taken to the University Hospital of Turku for treatment.
The woman's breath test came back at 2.02 per mil.
He's being held on suspicion of gross misdemeanor DUI.
The post office sent the parcels to the wrong town.
The Salon K-Citymarket had a shortage of groceries because the post office had delivered some of the cargo by accident to the Seinäjoki.
Teija Halti, from Pernio, was shopping for sweets at the Salon K-Citymarket on Thursday when she was struck by a funny sign.
Unfortunately, there's a shortage of supplies in the loose mail because the Post Office delivered our shipment to Wall River!
We'll get more when the Post gets the shipment!
So unless there's a traffic jam on the lawnmower, the sign said.
The sign with the 'Cowboy's' sign is linked to the fact that Posti extended its services to include the lawn mowing last spring.
The lawn mower is on the Post's menu until the end of August.
Haltian thought the sign was mostly funny and decided to share it on social media.
The popularity of the event struck me as a complete idiot.
The media have been calling all the time, and the attention this has gotten is unbelievable, Halti wonders.
By Friday night, Haltia's Facebook update had more than 700 shares.
The elves were able to stuff their favorite people into the trash bags, even though a few of the boxes were empty.
Jaakko Kaidesoja, who is responsible for the transport services business of Post's companies, apologised for the damage to Ilta-Sanom.
"The background is that three of the five stages went wrong yesterday (Seinäjoki) and we did not go to do the part (Saloon) with three, but we took only five stages today", Kaidesoja told Ilta-Sanom.
The first to report was the news agency, Ilta-Sanomat.
Teija Haltia was not offended by the sign because she found all her own loose cannonballs in the selection.
Lotta Backlund posted a picture of her transformation to the media.
The comedy producer has lost tens of pounds since the birth of her child.
Lotta Backlund has lost tens of pounds as a result of her lifestyle change.
Lotta shared the couple's change of scenery on Instagram on Friday.
In the spring Lotta was on a fitness tracker and aimed for a normal weight.
The Lotta Backlund in 2014.
Comic, TV producer Lotta Backlund started her weight loss campaign back in 2009.
He's a total lifestyle change and has lost a whopping 30 pounds.
On Friday, Backlund posted a couple of photos of his performance on Instagram.
The picture shows how much Lotta has changed in appearance over the years.
Backlund's before-and-after photo pair has garnered a number of appreciative comments from national news media.
You are so gorgeous.
We're on the same journey, and we're both motivated.
Piia Koriseva, Lotta Backlund and Mikael Saarinen were involved in the Do It Now project.
Your images give me tremendous energy and excitement as I go along the same path, another says.
Last spring, Lotta lost her last few pounds on the "Let's Do It Now" project.
At that time, he told Iltalehto that he wanted to finally reach normal weight, which was then ten kilograms.
In three months of training, I finally lost five pounds.
The family of a woman murdered in Loviisa wishes to donate her memories to police dogs
The family of a 42-year-old woman who was murdered in Loviisa last week is hoping that the victim will be remembered instead of flowers and addresses with a donation to the police dog.
The Sipoon Veterinary Office has posted a Facebook update to convey the wishes of the victim's family for donations to benefit police dogs.
The publication states that the victim had worked as a substitute nurse at the Sipoo Veterinary Hospital and had also completed her nursing training there.
The vet station remembers her with touching words.
Cheerful, smart, has a sense of humor, and is not afraid of work.
My good friend.
We still can't quite comprehend that he's gone.
The Facebook update includes an account number where donations can be transferred.
The update mentions that the donation money goes entirely to the police dog, primarily for the purchase of safety helmets.
Last Friday, a 42-year-old woman from Loviisa was murdered in her own backyard in Loviisa Koskenkylä.
The woman's neighbors have told Iltalehed that the victim was very fond of animals.
He owned several animals, including a horse, dogs, cats, chickens, and a chicken.
The 27-year-old suspect in the murder didn't know the woman and they had no connection to each other.
The police dog Börje was involved in the pursuit of the murderer, who was mortally wounded during the arrest.
But Borje survived and is recovering.
The District Court found Postil in violation of the Equality Act.
The Postal Service was not entitled to withhold the wages of a worker who had refused to train a hired worker, the Kanta-Hämeen Court of Appeal found in its judgment.
The court ordered Post to pay the employee the greater part of the withheld salary and EUR 2 000 in compensation for discrimination.
The Court held that the Posti could only deduct from the salary of the consultant a part of the consultant's salary for the whole day's work.
The employee had been placed in a disadvantaged position, contrary to the Equality Act, on the basis of his trade union activities.
The employee had complied with the PAU decision on the prohibition of information.
During the postal strike last November, the PAU made a decision that Post employees would not prosecute wage-earners who broke the strike.
The People's News first reported the matter.
Turkey's return to a path of respect for human rights
The EU is also calling for the EU to take action to combat terrorism, including the use of chemical weapons, and to ensure that the EU's arms industry is not disrupted by the use of chemical weapons.
The EU is also calling for the release of the three men who were arrested in connection with the attack.
The Journalists' Union had earlier asked Sipilä and Soinia in their letter to express their concern for freedom of expression and the press in Turkey.
The Commission is also proposing to introduce a new system of taxation for the benefit of the EU.
Putin has sacked his administration's chief of staff, replaced by an Estonian-based persecutor.
Russian President Vladimir Putin has fired his chief of staff Sergei Ivanov, the Kremlin says.
He is succeeded by the grandson of the Communist leader of the Soviet Union, Karl Vaino, Anton Vaino.
He was also responsible for the repression of the civilian population in the so-called 'Democratic Republic of Crimea'.
The new president will also become a member of the Russian Security Council, Interfax news agency reports.
Vladimir Putin fired the head of his administration.
Ivanov, a member of Putin's inner circle, will be assigned to special duties in the areas of environment and transport, according to a Kremlin communique.
According to Putin, Ivanov had personally requested the transfer to other posts and suggested Vaso as his replacement, Russia Today reports.
Ivanov worked with Putin during the Soviet era in KGB espionage.
Many thought Ivanov was a possible successor to Putin in 2008, but Dmitry Medvedev became president.
Ivanov was appointed in 2011 before Putin's re-election as President in 2012.
ManU's big move to the banquet - not to be seen at the Premier League opening
The world record holder in the world of football transfers will not be seen on the pitch when the English Premier League is kicked off this weekend.
Paul Pogba's ban was followed by a trip to England.
Manchester United forward Paul Pogba is suspended for the opening game of the season against Bournemouth on Sunday, the BBC reported on Friday.
ManU paid €105 million to the Italian club Juventus from Pogba, according to the British media.
However, the FA have ruled that Pogba will not be allowed to play, as Pogba was suspended by Juventus.
He got two reprimands last season in the Coppa Italia, and that's a one-game suspension.
The ban has been moved to England, the FA told the BBC.
Pogba's next game is the second round of the league on August 19, when ManU will face Southampton.
In Flow, the virtue of the megalomaniac
The precise criteria of entertainment and the ambitious vision have established Flow Festival as an internationally acclaimed event, featuring the world's top artists.
The Flow Festival starts on Friday in Helsinki.
The festarians have typically expressed themselves in their own distinctive attire.
One of the main artists this year is punk legend Iggy Pop.
The Flow Festival's event area is decorated with, among other things, fake snow and art installations.
"We have always wanted to have a beer tent and a headboard", says the event's artistic director, Tuomas Kallio.
Flow Festival, which is being held this weekend in Suvilahti, Helsinki, has grown from a small block party to an event attended by tens of thousands of people.
The success lies in a simple question: What kind of event would the people who made it want to go to?
It's a little unusual in the event industry to think that way.
"The aim is often to reach the level of necessity and to act according to the official instructions", says the event's artistic director, Tuomas Kallio.
He knew a week before the event that Flow would sell out this year too.
The aim has been to increase the number of visitors by 5 000 from the previous year's 70,000.
This year's festival will again feature a number of interesting local and foreign artists.
And that's a good thing, because you have to have some kind of funding to do what you do.
On the other hand, we don't want to grow too big, because at some point the mass would be like a herd of cattle being driven along huge paths.
We don't want that.
The ideology of the successful event has been expanded over the course of 13 years to include 130 performers, art installations, numerous restaurants and bars in the partly artificial area.
In addition to the main stage and smaller stages, this year's venue will be a 15,000-person tent.
Kallio admits that the event could be done in a simpler way.
Maybe I'm a little bit of a megalomaniac, but at the same time, we've managed to preserve Flow's spirit.
If we lose it, this is no longer our case.
Kallio's greatest joy and reward for his work is that today even grand visions are practically possible.
In the early years of the event, the mid-2000s, the activities were very dependent on the support of the City of Helsinki of about EUR 20 000.
Last year, the limited company operating Flow had a turnover of around EUR 6 million.
It can be used to accomplish "even trivial things", such as the erection of that 250-foot-wide [73 m] tent.
Flow's visitors have typically expressed themselves in a distinctive way.
And alongside the music event, there is a community of trendy young adults.
However, the event has not been deliberately profiled in a particular fashion.
We want to stand out first and foremost by the content.
However, the fashion phenomena also fit the values of Flow: curiosity and the desire to interact with the environment", says Kallio.
This year, one of the headliners is punk legend, 69-year-old Iggy Pop.
He has a huge fan base in his genre, but he's not the most typical performer at a festival that combines indie rock, pop music, rap and soul.
According to Kallio, Iggy was booked because this is probably the last time he's seen in Finland.
We're interested in everything, history and the future.
Not just what they play on commercial radio.
Iggy's latest record is damn good, and he's done some damn good gigs over the last few years.
The bombs in Thailand 's tourist paradise were hidden in flower pots . The tourists fled in terror .
Two bombs exploded in Hua Hin on Thursday night, local time.
At least one local woman was killed in the attack and more than 20 were injured.
The bombs were apparently hidden in a purse and detonated using cell phones.
The bombs were placed on a street whose customers are mostly foreigners.
The explosions were set off as tourists began to leave the bars and return to their hotels, police spokesman Samoer Yoosumran told CNN.
Edwin Wiek, a wildlife activist who has lived in Asia since 1989, tweeted a high-profile image of the attacks.
If you don't see the tweet, you can watch it here.
At least 11 of the injured in Hua Hin were foreign tourists.
A guy ran up to me and said there was a bomb outside the bar.
It happened on one of the main street bars, Swedish tourist Emelie Olsson told Aftonbladet.
The next morning, two bombs exploded in Surat Than.
At least one of them died.
The number of casualties is still unknown.
Soon after that, two bombs exploded on the island of Phuket, a favorite of the Finns.
No one is known to have died.
At the same time, there was another double bombing attack in Hua Hin.
At least one was killed and three were wounded.
There was also a bomb exploded in the city of Trang.
Police said they had found at least one bomb in Hua Hin that had not yet been detonated.
According to Thai authorities, the bombings are likely to be carried out by rebel forces who are unhappy with the actions of the Thai military leadership.
Local authorities estimate that criminal organizations may also be involved.
Aftonbladet reports that the police have recently been taking up the activities of criminal organizations involved in human trafficking.
KSML: This part of the new emergency forces will go to the battle first in a war situation
In an acute military situation, reservists are only called up for combat duty several months after taking the oath of military service, reports Keskisuomalainen.
According to the head of the Defence Forces Training, Brigadier General Jukka Sonnisen, interviewed by the newspaper, only those who are in the final stages of their training are combat-ready in a military situation, for example, of the servicemen who serve 5.5 months.
According to the head of training, the first to be assigned to the service will be reserve troops from the reserve forces.
No soldier or reservist is ordered to a task for which he has not been given the required training, Sonninen says.
Earlier this summer, it emerged that the Defence Force will begin training reservists for the immediate readiness units starting next year.
Units may be used for military purposes as early as in the course of the training of reservists, if required.
Pamela Tola was given a huge settlement by the hometown.
Actress Pamela Tola and her ex-husband, CEO Pauli Waroma have won a landmark dispute over an apartment they bought in Espoo in 2009.
The sale price of the two-storey detached house was EUR 330 000.
However, after the sale, a serious moisture problem was revealed in the house, causing a microbial growth that was dangerous to health.
The couple had to sell the apartment in 2014 to a foreclosure.
The selling price had dropped to EUR 132 000, so that the financial loss for Tola and Varoma amounted to EUR 198 000.
The couple took the matter to court, demanding a price reduction.
The seller denied the claim, but Tola and Waroma won the case in both the plaintiff and the court.
The court of appeals ruled Wednesday.
It upheld the judgment of the Court of First Instance ordering the seller to pay Tola and Waroma EUR 150 000 for the price reduction.
In addition, the seller is required to pay the couple's legal and settlement costs, totalling EUR 47 344.
The Court moderated the price reduction somewhat, since the need for some repairs to the dwelling had been known to the purchasers at the time of the sale.
However, according to the Court of Justice, the errors of construction which had been revealed were substantially more serious than those which had been alleged.
Tola was looking for a good home .
Tola told the court that the couple had specifically sought a good-quality home because they did not want to undertake repairs.
He had the impression that the building was repaired and in good condition and that the elements mentioned in the inspection report were not a problem.
The climate inspection report cited the risks and drawbacks of ventilation and the inadequate management of rain and meltwater flowing down the escarpment.
However, the discussions did not reveal any urgency.
Tola and Waroma thought that perhaps in a few years the rainwater coming from the rock should be diverted a little.
The deal was made in October 2009.
Within a few years, the apartment's moisture problems proved to be much more serious than we had thought.
During inspections in 2012 and 2013, the building was found to be infested with microorganisms, which the witnesses said were caused by both rainwater from the rock and soil moisture from capillary rise.
On the west side of the house, the inspector estimated that microbial air could also be released through the porch into the interior.
Mould or scale exceeding the limit values, which may constitute a health hazard, were found in the kitchen sink, the basement staircase, the living room window sill and the basement washroom.
The terraces were built without a permit.
The court also disputed whether the extension of the apartment was in breach of the building permit.
The court found that Tola and Waroma had not been aware of the decision of the City of Espoo before the transaction to the effect that the apartment had been altered in breach of the authorisation.
Among other things, terraces were built, although there were no proper lenses yet.
But the issue of homeopathy was central to the trial.
According to the court, the buyers could assume from the information received from the seller before the sale that the building was suitable for living as it was and that there was no need for major renovation work in the near future.
The Court of First Instance considered that there was no particular reason for Tola and Waroma to carry out a more extensive review than is usual.
The buyers have not failed to fulfil their obligation to pay, the court finds.
Horrific archive find: hundreds of thousands of women wanted to give birth to children for the Nazis - Finnish in the register too
In a recent article in the newspaper Dagens Nyheter, journalist Christopher Andersson writes about how the National Archives in Maryland, U.S.A., has microfilmed records of a total of 218,500 women, all of whom wanted to marry SS men.
Most of the women are German, but there are also American, French, Dutch and Russian women.
In addition, at least 65 Danish, 86 Norwegian, 14 Finnish, and 31 Swedish women wanted to become Nazi-morsys.
The documents and registration cards are from the Office of Race in Nazi Germany.
The Office of Race was under the direction of SS leader Heinrich Himmler.
No SS man in Nazi Germany was allowed to have children until he had been examined by an SS doctor.
The same was true even more for women who were expected to be able to give birth to up to 10 children.
According to Andersson, the women underwent gynecological examinations to determine the cause.
The Office of Race Classification examined the women's backgrounds, including church books.
The purpose was to make sure that there were no Jews in the women's family.
Women also had to be prepared to renounce their Swedish citizenship and to give the Office of Race a handwritten biography and good recommendations from their relatives.
The Office of Race wanted assurances that the women were "child-loving", "savvy", and "good National Socialists" who spoke good German.
Women who did not meet the requirements were not accepted as brides for SS men.
The case does not tell what happened to the 14 Finnish women found in the archives.
SS leaders created a state-sponsored program known as Lebensborn in 1936.
Among other things, the program stipulated that each SS man should have four children, either in or out of wedlock.
The Lebensborn homes take care of children born outside of marriage and their mothers.
However, the program was not promoted very actively, according to the website of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum.
Instead, the Nazi population policy focused on the family and marriage.
The state encouraged marriage by offering loans and support for childbearing.
The German Mother's Medal of Honor was awarded to women who had given birth to at least four children.
In Nazi Germany, marriages between "Aryan" and "non-Aryan" people were prohibited by law, according to the museum's website.
The trickster siren sixth, the knight rose and fell
Tapio Nirkko finished third in the first Finnjolli sailing race of the day at the Rio Olympics, but finished on top of the whole group in the second race of the day.
Nirkko moved up to eighth in the overall standings after five starts, but the failure of the second start dropped him to 14th.
The Winds of Trickery-Siren fought in the RS:X class day starts on the 17th and 3rd places.
Overall, the Deceiver Siren is sixth.
In the 470 class, Joonas and Niklas Lindgren finished 23rd in the opening race of the day.
Overall, the Lindgrens are 19th.
Jari Sillanpään Satulinna was recorded for a couple of hours in the night: "I was so hungover"
Jari Sillanpää has been one of the most popular artists in Finland for over 20 years.
From cruise ship bartender to 1995's tango king, Finland's best-selling solo artist and star of the dance floats and festare, Sillanpää has a long way to go and is currently in a frenzy.
The book Jari Sillanpää - Paljaana, written by Mari Koppinen, about the life of a popular singer, was published today, Thursday.
In the book Sillanpää tells about his life and career in good and bad.
Sillanpään's career rose to an all-time high when he won the crown of the king of tango at the Seinäjoki tango market in 1995.
At the competition, Sillanpää sang tangos, but he had already planned a different kind of music for himself.
In the spring of 1995, Jukka Kuoppamäki had composed a tango piece for Sillanpää at the request of the man, which Kassu Halonen adapted to a slightly different form.
The song Satulinna became one of the most popular songs in Finnish music history.
The book says that the recording of the song did not go exactly as planned: Sillanpää sang it on tape in terrible hunger and only after a couple of hours of sleep.
We had a party last night.
I was so confused!
The bridge is mentioned in the book.
A recording of a song that became a huge hit would not be readily identified as being sung during a hangover.
Even though I wasn't at my best physically, the trail was still good.
I learned that you don't have to be perfect and you don't have to be the best all the time.
The second coincidence related in the book involving the man's most popular songs occurred nearly two decades later.
In 2013, Sillanpää divorced her then-partner and the case eventually ended with the lyrics of the song "Du verdienst guldet" (You deserve gold), which was released as a single in 2014.
The book tells us that the lyrics of the songs that Saara Törmäne was commissioned to write were not what Sillanpää would have wanted.
Sillanpää had imagined that he was making a record that told the true story of his own life, but the words of the song about the divorce were not true, but it was written based on the news of the magazine 7 Days.
The newspaper said that the reason for the separation was because of excessive partying and alcohol consumption, but Jari said it was nonsense and not true.
Jari called the record company in a rage about the book and refused to sing the song, but eventually he decided to sing it - and it was a good thing.
In June, the British surprised even themselves by voting for their empire to leave the EU.
In the end, 52 percent of those voting supported the separation, and 48 percent would have remained in the union, even though opinion polls during the week of the vote predicted the opposite.
The British economists and economic institutions were almost unanimous in their support for remaining in the EU.
No respected research institution or university would sign off, even though a few individual researchers might disagree with the mainstream of their profession.
The basic mantra of Western politics, the campaign slogan of former US President Bill Clinton, "It's the economy, stupid", was thrown into the garbage in the UK's Brexit vote.
Economists were shocked when their voices were not heard.
They were shocked that the economy didn't seem to be the most important political issue.
The economic crisis
In its latest monthly survey, the Centre for Macroeconomics is gathering responses from the professional world to the Brexit disaster.
The most typical answer is that economists were not consulted, because this time, voters made a decision based on something other than economics.
One of the reasons economists give for the loss of economic status is that people don't understand economics.
Many people still believe that the number of jobs is independent of the number of people in work, almost constant.
If an immigrant gets a job, it's right off the bat.
Many also feel that a fall in the value of the currency would be a good thing because it would help the export industry.
The Committee felt that the voters did not believe the economic arguments because the consensus of the economists was not sufficiently expressed.
They were particularly dismayed by the BBC's impartiality, which gave as much room to the few percent of economists who supported EU secession as to the overwhelming majority.
The anti-EU press was not interested in telling what the views of the IFS, the IFM, the BoE, the CEPR and the LSE and other economic powerhouses on the consequences of the divorce were.
Those distant combinations of letters spoke in vain of economic growth, trade relations, national debt and currency.
And if the economists' messages were both heard and understood, they were not conveyed, because the economists represent an elite with which voters do not feel they have a common interest.
While academics from big cities like the Economists would have stayed in the EU, the message was not being sent to small towns and the countryside.
Immigration is an economy too
The overwhelming victory argument of the Brexit vote was about immigration.
The immigrant takes your job, the immigrant crowds your hospital, the immigrant takes advantage of you.
These arguments worked.
Every cafe has foreign workers.
How many more jobs would the British have if they left?
Every health center waiting room has immigrants.
How much easier would it be for the British to have medical offices if they didn't have them?
Every school has immigrant kids.
How much easier would it be for real British children to get a place in school if they were disposed of?
Every county has foreigners.
How much more space would the natives have if they left?
I think these are economic issues.
They concern jobs, housing and public services.
But the economists were unable to answer them, and if they did, their answers were not seen.
Economists have failed to explain that immigration has led to more jobs, fewer health care facilities, and more money for education and social security.
Immigrants - and especially EU immigrants - are net contributors to the UK's public finances and their spending creates jobs.
The Aberdeen Real Estate Fund was prepared for Brexit in cash.
One of these funds was Aberdeen Asset Management, whose real estate investments are managed by a Finnishman, Pertti Vanhanen.
He said Aberdeen had prepared for Brexit in time by drawing up plans A and B.
The plan B, or the pro-EU camp, was prepared more precisely a few weeks before the vote in case the result was a 'no' vote.
The concern was that investors would start pulling their assets out of the market.
Real estate funds don't normally have a measurable liquidity reserve, but now they might need one.
We went to grow cash.
When Brexit happened on the 23rd, we had 25% of the fund's investments in cash or liquid assets, says Vanhanen of Aberdeen's only open daily quoted real estate fund, which the news touched.
The old guy said the normal rate would be 15 to 20 percent.
The fund was valued at £3.5 billion at the time.
The total value of the company's funds is approximately £20 billion.
It was the highest of the nine open real estate funds, Vanhanen says, of all the open real estate funds in the UK.
He estimates that the lowest cash in these funds fell to 10% or even below.
So the real estate funds were preparing for Brexit with very different strategies.
The funds closed the trade
When the pro-Brexit camp won, Europe went into chaos.
The two weeks following the vote on the property market were, however, fairly calm, Vanhanen said.
Then two things happened that changed the situation.
The first was a speech by Mark Carney, Governor of the Bank of England, in which he suggested that Brexit could be a major risk for commercial property operators.
In addition, the first of the real estate funds, Standard Life, froze its trading.
Together, they took the situation to the headlines of the Financial Times and the BBC.
The situation was immediately compared with 2007 and 2008, Vanhanen says.
This made investors nervous.
Institutional investors remained more calm, but private investors were nervous.
The snowball started to roll, and one fund after another had to close its doors.
Aberdeen was in a good position because of the cash that had been collected, but it too was eventually forced to freeze its trade for six days.
The old one said that they didn't actually close the business, but they changed the pricing down.
In practice, he said, investors were given time to consider whether it was worthwhile to withdraw the money in a panic.
Aberdeen's message was that if you didn't have to take your money out now, it wouldn't be worth it, because it would cause losses.
It calmed the situation, and most of them withdrew their complaint.
The market has been fairly stable since then, and now it has been very calm for a couple of weeks, says Vanhanen.
He said that the European Union had no intention of creating a new European Union.
But there were a lot of questions.
Impolite attention to real estate funds
The old man felt that the closing of real estate funds was receiving undue attention.
The open-ended funds affected by the closures control about 4% of the UK's real estate.
The Aberdeen lockdown lasted six days, and the company sold out less than 10 properties out of its 80 properties in London.
Some other funds are still closed.
Aviva Investors warned its investors this week that it may be holding on to its funds for the second half of 2017.
The current uncertainty and downward revision of economic growth forecasts do not make the situation any worse for Aberdeen.
The biggest questions now concern the future development of the British economy.
Despite the uncertainty, the situation has even opened up new opportunities for some property investors, Vanhanen points out.
The pound and dollar are at their weakest levels in 30 years, and the market is down 15% from the pre-Brexit vote.
Now a dollar buyer can buy the same property at up to 30% off.
The Old Man says there are many willing buyers.
Brexit has had a negative impact on the London property market
At 2:00 a.m., things were not looking too bad.
But at four, when Pertti Vanhanen, head of real estate investments at Aberdeen Asset Management, a British real estate fund, woke up again to watch the results of the Brexit vote, things were different.
That's where the power word came from.
I realized that this is now going to plan B, says Vanhanen in his second home in Helsinki.
He went straight to work.
London City was already alive and well, despite the dawn.
The normally silent TV screens in the office broadcast the news, and the normally noisy crowd fell silent to listen as Prime Minister David Cameron stepped before the camera this morning to announce his resignation.
When the market opened, the display cases were all flashing red.
It was a morning he never thought he'd live to see, says the old man.
Not so much that despite the turmoil, Aberdeen, one of the largest real estate funds in Britain, completed two real estate deals the day after the Brexit vote.
It was a mixed atmosphere.
However, the company was well prepared for the alternative, so the situation was somewhat calm, Vanhanen says.
The Brexit vote has started a correction.
The voice was followed by a storm.
The pound collapsed, the British leadership changed.
The market was beginning to anticipate a severe downturn in the UK property market, and in London in particular.
London office space was forecast to suffer losses of up to 20 percent in the coming years.
Soon a number of British real estate funds began to freeze their trades one after another.
And Aberdeen did that for six days.
Now the fog has cleared, but there's still uncertainty in the air.
It is not, however, the face of the old man who spent his last summer days in Helsinki this week.
The Commission is also keen to see the EU's role in the fight against terrorism as well as its role in the fight against terrorism.
So much is still open: how the difference is going to happen and how Scotland is going to react to the situation, like this.
Initial information on the development of the London property market has already been received.
The real estate services company CBRE's price developments cover about one third of the market.
They show that the prices of all properties in London fell by 3.3% from June to July.
In the City of London, the loss was 6.1 percent, says Vanhanen.
The numbers aren't that bad, but they're monthly.
The monthly index was launched in 1987 and only five months have had worse figures, says Vanhanen.
All the equally large declines were in the crisis years 2007 and 2008.
It's interesting because Brexit was compared very quickly to Lehman's collapse and the global economic crisis that started in the U.S. housing market.
The old man thinks the comparison is not quite right, because we are dealing with a domestic crisis in Britain.
The tunnel maker is another.
The real estate market has not seen panic selling like it did in those days, but a willingness to sell to improve liquidity, says Vanhanen.
I'm sure you'll find some money.
The repair shop could have been in front anyway
In fact, he does not think that the price correction movement is a miracle - one could have been in the offing even without Brexit.
Aberdeen's estimate is that London and other world-class cities have been overvaluing their real estate for years.
"We've been saying for two years that the City and especially the offices are overpriced", says Vanhanen.
So the drop started really high.
London prices have skyrocketed for four reasons, the Old Man's list.
The British economy has grown strongly, and so has the population of London.
Another big trend is that real estate is the last class of property to go global, Vanhanen says.
New players have entered the market from the Middle East and Asia, and more and more institutional and private investors are looking for real estate investment opportunities abroad.
London is known as a city of easy targets.
In addition, prices have been driven by low interest rates, which have forced pension funds, for example, to look for new targets for their revenues.
On top of that, credit has been readily available - although the leverage is now, according to the old man, significantly less than during the pre-2008 crisis boom.
♪ Spread out, spread out ♪
In London, the price increase was flat last summer, says Vanhanen.
Aberdeen started to dilute its holdings in London, and last year it became a net seller.
There was a twist to be expected, and now it's come.
What about from now on?
It depends on how the British economy develops, says Vanhanen.
He doesn't have much to say about the future, but he says there's no chance of any uptick.
The mood suggests a downward or a steady downward trend.
Old has seen more ups and downs since he's been in the real estate business since 1988.
And he's still an optimist who believes that you can work your way out of a hole.
If you're prepared to take risks, you're in a better position.
He believes in global decentralization.
If you've invested in one market, you're too much of a victim.
If you have decentralised, the risks are also decentralised, says the Old Man.
S Group starts recording more details on purchases
Soon the S Group will know what you're eating, as the retail group announced today that it will begin collecting more detailed information on its regular customers' purchases.
The group will start collecting the final amount of the receipt from the beginning of May, after the information has been collected so far.
Group S is behind Kesko in this, as the data on goods purchased with a plus card has been collected in Kesko's customer register for a couple of years.
According to Ismo Riitalan, CEO of K-Plus Oy, the feedback received from the programme has been mainly positive.
Product-specific data are collected with the consent of the customer and used for marketing purposes subject to authorisation.
The most effective channel is email.
Very few customers have refused to use product information, says Riitala to Taloussanom.
He says Kesko's not going to react to the change in the S-Group registration.
Even by purchasing groceries, Kesko classifies its regular customers into ten groups.
The ranking is updated monthly.
Retail customers are also classified by the number of purchases and the amount of money spent on them.
The information is used for targeted marketing to the customer.
Product-specific purchasing data is collected only from K-Group's own chains.
The partners, such as Neste Oil, do not share their data.
Lidl Suom does not have a regular customer programme and is not planning to do so at this stage.
The Finnish marketplace has its own One-Stop-Bonus customer programme, which can be joined at Valintatalo, Siwo and Euromarkkinet.
At present, we do not collect product or group level data, but we keep the final amount of the receipt.
So we know where the purchases were made, and I know the date and the customer's receipt for the final amount.
We have not reached the level of the K Group or the S Group, says commercial manager Anu Ora.
He said that the regular customer programme was to be reformed in the future, but that the department would inform the public later.
However, the OAU does not promise that product information will be registered.
First , an experiment .
The register of SOK's customers and customers has been relatively extensive up to now.
In addition to personal and address data, the basic data also included occupation, education, type of residence, and the years of birth and previous personal data of the children.
The persons belonging to the same economy and their role are also recorded.
The S-E card records the date and time of purchase, the place, the total amount of the purchase and the method of payment.
In addition, the information on S-bonus partners is derived from their cash-systems.
From the beginning of May, product-level purchase data will be stored on Sokos and Emotion chains.
In the S-markets, Prismos, Kodin Terro and ABC chains, however, data are currently recorded at product group level.
"Customers have long been hoping that marketing could be targeted more precisely", says Marjaana Saarikoski, Head of Customer Ownership and Partnership at SOK.
S-Group says they're aware of the change in their clients.
They may prohibit the use of product-specific information for marketing purposes.
But the data is being stored in the registers anyway, whether you want it or not.
Anyone who wants to check their data is welcome to visit the S Group website.
The Commission is also proposing to introduce a new system of taxation for the benefit of the taxpayer.
Video: The Heila puppy is the newest dog reinforcement for the Customs - the puppy becomes the first explosion dog
A young black labrador bird is sniffing vigorously through five similar boxes lined up in the ground at Helsinki Airport.
It won't be long, as it sits firmly against the middle box.
Customs inspector Lassi Suntio rewards his dog Heila by playing with her favorite toy.
The box next to which Heila was sitting revealed a bottle of shells smelling of gunpowder.
"Powder gas is the first smell that Heila has been practiced with", says Suntio, the owner of the dog.
Security situation and main reasons for online trading
Heila is the first dog in the Customs Service to be trained to search for weapons and explosives and will be placed to work at Helsinki Airport next year.
The tasks may also take Heila and Sunti to other border crossing points and ports if necessary.
However, the airport will be the main workplace for Heil, as the international security situation has changed due to the serious terrorist attacks in Europe.
The EU is also keen to see the EU's role in the fight against terrorism and the fight against terrorism in the wider world.
Another access to weapons and explosive training is the postal consignments passing through Helsinki Airport.
With the growth of e-commerce, the airport handles up to 40 million mail items a year, including foreign-ordered munitions and explosives.
In recent years, customs have made some 300 findings at Helsinki Airport's online shop, among passenger aircraft baggage and airline cargo related to weapons, parts of weapons, ammunition and explosives and their precursors.
Heila will work in different parts of Helsinki Airport.
It's gonna be checking registered luggage and mail.
"It will be of great benefit in the future when it can pass through large container areas and mark areas that require more detailed research", says Grönberg.
Based on the performance of the shell, Customs will assess whether more weapons and explosives dogs will be trained in the future.
Grönberg is optimistic about the idea.
School in the Church
The education of the Heila-penn is coordinated by Tullin School, which is located in Kirkkum.
Suntio is also training with Heila with police and defence experts.
The police have a strong track record of training dogs and the Defence Forces have expertise in explosives.
Customs and other authorities decide what scents Heila is taught to recognize.
Heila is always trained further if necessary, says Grönberg.
Heila's colleagues at Helsinki-Vantaa are the six drug dogs at the Customs Office and the money and drug dog, Massi.
Labrador retriever Heila has been selected from a litter of ten puppies.
The criteria for selecting a dog for an airport include a willingness to hunt and a willingness to be calm, since the dog is exposed to weapons, explosives and human flows.
Heila, who lives in Sunti's house, is a close workmate of the customs inspector, but also a member of the family.
Nothing happens without Heila at home, Suntio laughs.
He's got a lot of fine-grained orders to follow.
The cameraman from Night Sings loses the camera mic cover to the fast dog, but Heila restores the soft toy-like cover to the "Stop" command.
Hard competition for the working dogs
Heila's elementary school will be finished next year.
There are still some tests to be held in October, to assess whether the training is sufficient for the demanding job.
Heila can be seen working at Helsinki-Vanta in the middle of next year, if everything goes according to plan.
Unfortunately, passengers cannot come and pet a dog in a work vest, Suntio reminds us.
The cost of one working dog to the customs is approximately EUR 60000-70000 per year.
Their working life is about seven or eight years, up to ten, after which they retire to the care of their owners.
Working days can be long, from eight to ten hours, but active work periods last only from ten minutes to a couple of hours.
There's a lot of competition for dog ownership in Customs.
Heila hired about 20 or 30 Tull employees to own it.
Lucky for Suntion, who has never had a working dog before, but has years of experience with dogs and supervisory duties at Customs.
The nation of Mini won its first Olympic medal . The people of Mini will have a day off .
The Olympic rugby of Fiji, a nation of less than a million, is so highly regarded that the government has declared August 22 a national holiday.
The Fiji government confirmed the case after the championship was decided.
The day after the team's homecoming, we have a day off.
The hero team will also be celebrating back home.
The Fiji rugby team celebrating their championship.
The Guardian reports that the country was able to watch the final in the capital Suva, where a screen was installed on the stadium.
Normally only native Fijians are interested in rugby, but this game brought our multicultural community together.
Even in Chinese restaurants, people were watching the game, I heard them cheering, said Fiji Times reporter Maikele Seru to the Guardian.
Drama in Rio - Finnish conductor fainted after a violent performance
The printer Milko Tokola succeeded in his last attempt after a hard fight of 175 kilos.
The tocola has a peculiar and life-threatening property for a lifter.
During or immediately after heavy lifting, he has fainted many times.
No one's really been able to say why.
In Rio, Tokola gained 175 kilos for pushing and 145 kilos for grabbing.
His combined weight was 320 pounds.
Tokola was trying to get his last 175 pounds back, as was his second.
On the third attempt, the weights rose to accompanied by a furious scream.
The body was shaking under the weight until the jury agreed to the withdrawal.
The Finnish speaker's joy was accompanied by the fact that he had suffered from knee problems.
RoPS has acquired the Estonian striker Prosan
The men's football league club Rovaniemi Palloseura has signed an end-of-season contract with Estonian striker Albert Prosa.
We're looking for a top player for our team, with a lot of potential and a small chance of coming to Finland and Rovaniemi.
We went through over 50 players from around the world with over a dozen player agents.
Prosa was gradually emerging as a good option, RoPS coach Juha Malinen said in a press release.
Prosa, 25, joins RoPS from the Floras of Stalingrad, where he scored 51 goals in 109 matches.
He has also played for the Estonia national team.
Prosan is scheduled to join RoPS on Saturday at the Seinäjoki, where the Rovaniemians will face the reigning Finnish champion SJK.
RoPS needed a new striker after last season's painting king, Alexander Kokko, moved to Australia.
The proud Modern Family star shakes it up again: Teenage star's shorts reveal almost everything
Ariel Winter, who became known as Alex Dunphyna on the comedy series Modern Family, is once again stunned by the display of her menacing body.
Winter was filmed in Hollywood this week in mini-shorts that don't leave much to the imagination.
The shorts not only revealed the actor's legs, but also his butt.
Eighteen-year-old Winter has recently attracted attention by changing his style and behaviour to a more daring one.
The star has posed in photos posted on social media in very minimal clothing and has taken numerous tattoos.
A young woman has also been seen wearing very tight clothing.
Winter, who is on the verge of adulthood, has also recently posted several pictures of himself at a party.
If you can't see the picture, you can watch it here.
Earlier this summer, Fox News asked experts why Winter has changed his public image so radically.
At the time, PowerwomenTV founder and CEO Amy Palmer suspected that Winter was undergoing a "typical Hollywood makeover" from child star to adult.
She's been on television for most of her life, and she grew up in the Kardashian era.
"He has learned that the more he can see, the more publicity and attention he gets in Hollywood", Palmer told Fox News, adding that the exact same phenomenon has been seen countless times before.
Winter started on Modern Family when she was only 11 years old.
The actor has upset some of his longtime fans with his image change.
It's not hard to guess where he'll be in ten years, with the downturn already so hard, notes a woman on Winter's Instagram.
Some of her fans, however, defend the actress and urge her to ignore critics.
You look great!
I don't care what anyone says.
You're an inspiration to many women, says a young woman with a sparkling complexion.
The Japanese prefer the Nordic countries to Finland - tourists are attracted by the aurora: in autumn it is possible to see the fairy mirror aurora
The campaign aims to attract Japanese people to start skiing in the early autumn, says a press release from Visit Finland.
The main destinations for Japanese light-year tourism are Inari and Levi.
The snowflake is the symbol of our winter tourism, and it is strongly associated with the winter and the snowy landscape.
The Lapland winter skiing is in high demand, but we're trying to increase sales for the autumn skiing.
Few people know that the spring season begins in early autumn and continues into late spring.
In autumn, it is possible to see the so-called mirror aurora, where the surface of the lake reflects the aurora, making the sight double the number of times it is visible, says Anne Lind, Visit Finland's marketing manager.
The main target group of the Visit Finland campaign is wealthy Japanese women aged 25-35 living in the city, who dream of travel and new experiences.
They are already interested in Finland, its nature and design.
One of the ways to attract tourists to Finland is through online advertising.
According to a survey carried out by researchers from the University of Aalto and the Universities of Turku and Tokyo, Finland has an exceptionally strong and positive image of the country among Japanese people compared to other Nordic countries.
However, the Japanese would like to see more distinctly unique sights from Finland, and this is a lighthouse with enormous potential, according to Lind.
The number of overnight stays by Japanese tourists in Finland has increased significantly more than in other Nordic countries.
Last year, they spent more than twice as many nights in Finland as in Sweden, Denmark or Norway.
The Japanese are an interesting target group for Finnish tourism, as they spent over EUR 80 million in Finland.
On average, the Japanese spent 183 euros a day in Finland, says Lind.
Britain will settle for silver in rugby while a FIDE-sponsored master class will lead the gold.
Great Britain's impressive progress in rugby has collapsed in the final challenge presented by Fiji in Thursday night's final, when the team suffered a 43-7 crushing defeat at Deodoro Stadium here in Rio.
Fidzi organized a master class in handling, purging, wrestling, backstroke, running line and silk throwing to win gold - their first Olympic medal.
With the loss came a modest consolation of silver - the third of Britain's day - and pride in their hard work in the opening round of the Olympic rugby tournament, in which they defeated New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.
Earlier in the day, a tough 7-5 semifinal win over South Africa could have put them in a tough spot in the final.
But despite this, Fidi would have beaten a team of 15 of the best in the world.
The British people may be comforted - but probably not - by the fact that at least one Briton will have a gold medal on his back tomorrow: Ben Ryan, the former England coach at Wimbledon, will be the head coach of FIDE.
It's been quite a journey to Great Britain.
Eight years ago, they lost every game in the Adelaide tournament, coached by Ryan.
They only lost one.
This back injury is painful, but the progress is startling.
Fide made a fine start, rejecting the British for the fun of it.
For Captain Tom Mitchell and his team, it was like they were running into moving buses, and the world champions led 5-0 after Osea Kolinisau dived into the end zone on the corner.
With four minutes left, Jerry Tuway's second touchdown on the right side led to a touchdown.
12 to 0, and Britain had barely touched the ball.
Mitchell's brilliant tackle stopped the third goal from the man-mountain Leone Nakarawa, but it was a slow start for Fid.
At the seven-minute mark, Jasa Veremalua scored from the right corner, and Great Britain were 17-0 down.
Nakarawa scored again for a new start, and the clock was still over a minute... from the first half.
Vatemo Ravouvou then stormed through the loose tackling of Great Britain and rushed to the line to score a goal.
After the goal kick, the score at halftime was 29-0
It was as if Fidi had been born to play rugby, while Great Britain was just learning the game.
And that's the way it is.
Great Britain made a series of changes in the break that blocked Fidi's dam...for a total of four minutes, which was good compared to the first half, until Josua Tuisova scored after Fidi's impressive pass.
Dan Norton caught for Great Britain with a touchdown from the left corner, narrowing the score to 36-7, but the game had long been lost to the South Sea Islanders, whose supporters sang, waved flags and danced in the stands.
It was hard not to admire Fide's cheerful approach.
The last painting by Mata Viliame had a peel on Fidi's cake, which did not need peeling.
The whistle was blown, the Fiddlers were embraced, and Great Britain fell on the grass, completely beaten.
Earlier in the day, Fidi had beaten Japan in the semi-final 20-5 and Great Britain beat South Africa in a tight semi-final where both scored a goal - the British shot was the deciding factor.
Kyle Brown led South Africa in the first half, but Dan Norton crossed the goal line with a stunning footwork and scored under the goalposts in the second half.
A late, great tackle from Marcus Watson, Anthony's brother on the England 15 rugby team, ensured victory and eventually the silver medal.
Coach 's battle with cancer has led to a resounding victory for Helen Glover and Heather Stanning .
There will be no more emotionally stimulating gold in these games, and that does mean something.
From the first bet to the last, 220 hard-fought races to the history books, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found a deeper meaning in their golden moment at Estacio da Lagoa.
Although they were two singers, there were three voices in the boat, and the echo of coach Robin Williams was present throughout as the pair rowed into their second consecutive Olympic gold in the women's pair event - the first women in the history books of British sport to achieve such an achievement.
Their rule was perfect, and this was their 39th appearance unbeaten, which is also a record.
This, what we see, two great athletes joining on the surface with swan-like grace, does not fully reflect the nature of victory.
Behind every soot is a group of helpful hands that gradually advance the things that matter, and no pair of hands was as essential as the coach who, 30 months ago, after being diagnosed with cancer, didn't know if he would live to see this day.
Like he said, it was a dead end.
I had bladder cancer, which is one of the things that can be cut, and they did the cut.
If they don't cut it, it's going to spread everywhere.
It could have been pretty bad.
It'll change your mind a little.
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.
The trio was fortunate in that their treatment was able to begin in early 2014 in the off-season, causing as little disruption as possible - if that term can ever be used in situations like this.
I had to get paid, so I had to get better fast.
It was a great motivator.
I was in the hospital, walking around the ward, 20, 30, 50 feet at a time, when they said a few steps would be enough.
That's how it started.
The plundering itself is a journey, but it makes it a little bit bigger.
Immediately after the victory, the first thing on the mind of the couple was Williams, who had had a nervous morning and had spoken a little more than usual in an attempt to deal with his nervousness.
Stanning, a veteran of the Royal Regiment of Artillery, who served in Afghanistan, said: 'I've been a wreck this week, which may be a bit of an overreaction, but this means so much to me.'
It just underscores how important this is to me, how hard me and Helen, and Robin, have been working.
These past three years with Helen and Robin have been amazing.
Without Robin, we would be nothing, so he deserves a big thank you, he's the best coach in the world.
I couldn't have asked for a better training partner or a better coach.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning haven't lost a competition in five years.
The pair set a tight pace that their competitors couldn't match.
Even in the final 500 metres, when the New Zealand and Danish teams started to approach, Stanning and Glover had too much energy in store.
We were very close in no time.
Helen was yelling, "Keep in the process, keep in the process".
It's really important to keep control.
We had a good start, and at the same time we weren't trying to do anything special.
We weren't looking for fireworks today, we were just looking for a good fight and winning the race, and that's what we did.
He's gonna wait a couple of years before deciding his future.
Glover will be attending the wedding next month when she marries TV adventurer Steve Backshall.
Right now, all he wants is to enjoy the moment.
I didn't want to say this was my last competition.
It would have put too much pressure on him.
After London, it took me about six months to realize that I was an Olympic champion.
It was all so new, and I was so stressed.
It was about four minutes here.
This feels so much better, she said.
Iceland replaces government ripped off by Panama leaks
Iceland will hold early parliamentary elections in October, which protesters, angered by the Panama leaks, have been demanding since spring.
The so-called Panama Papers exposed the tax evasion of a number of Icelandic politicians through tax havens.
Prime Minister Sigmundur David Gunnlaugsson resigned because of the scandal, but it was not enough for the protesters.
His successor, Sigurdur Ingi Johannsson, promised at the time to hold new parliamentary elections in the autumn.
The election date has now been set for October 29.
Analysts say it's hard to predict how much the public's latest outrage will affect the outcome of this fall's election.
In the presidential elections in June, criticism of the incumbent was evident, and Gudni Johannesson, who had run for office from outside politics, was elected president.
Trump said he was being sarcastic when he said that Obama was the founder of ISIS.
Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has canceled his latest eulogy.
He said he was being sarcastic when he claimed that President Barack Obama was the founder of the terrorist organisation ISIS and that Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton was also involved in the organisation's founding.
The Democratic Party was furious with the speech and demanded an apology from Trump.
"The Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces should never let anyone who can sink that low", Clinton tweeted.
In the south of France, the mayor of Cannes has banned the wearing of the burkini, a popular Muslim swimming costume, at swimming pools, reports the Guardian, a British newspaper.
The decree, signed by Mayor David Lisnard, states that anyone not wearing a swimsuit that is in keeping with good manners and secularism is prohibited from going to the beach and swimming.
The decision also states that swimsuits that are a grand expression of religious affiliation may increase the risk of disorder in France, which has been the target of terrorist attacks.
In mid-July, 85 people were killed and hundreds more were injured in Nice when a 31-year-old man drove his car into a crowd celebrating France's National Day.
In late July, two extremist men linked to ISIS attacked a church in northern France and killed a priest in his 80s.
The quality of the Oulu region's bathing water has surpassed that of the Pyykösjärvi
Water samples taken from official bathing areas in the Oulu region meet the quality requirements for bathing water.
Only the lake Pyykösjärvi has been found to have blue-eyed seaweed.
On Tuesday and Wednesday, the Oulu Regional Environmental Action took water samples from nine EU beaches and 30 other public bathing beaches in the Oulu region.
The concentration of E. coli and enteric cocci in the bathing water of all bathing areas except the coast of the sea was below the action levels set by the Ministry of Social Affairs and Health.
E. coli and enterococcus levels in the seaweed swimming pool were confirmed on Wednesday, when the bacterial levels had fallen below the action limits.
The blue-green sediment found on the shore of Lake Pyykos does not yet make the water unfit for swimming, but under favourable conditions the situation can quickly turn into blue-green sediment, resulting in blue-green sediment mass in the form of plates on the water surface.
The Environment Agency is monitoring the situation with increased inspections.
If the bluefin turtle becomes a bluefin, a separate notice shall also be posted on the swimming pool bulletin board.
Check out the results of the pool water samples here.
The Commission's report on the reduction of deforestation: over 80% of forest owners outside
The deforestation cut is one of the tax changes in the Treasury's budget proposal for next year.
The income tax law proposes a tax reduction to be granted on the basis of the gift tax on the generational change of the forestry holding.
The Ministry of Finance proposes that forest loss reduction has four objectives: to promote generational changes in forest holdings, to rejuvenate the age structure of forest owners, to increase the size of forest holdings and to increase the supply of wood.
The Ministry's objective is to promote an entrepreneurial forestry economy.
The owner of the forest would make a deduction from the net capital income of the forestry.
The idea of creating such a tool to promote generational changes in forestry is a good one, comments Juha Hakkarainen, Forestry Director of the Central Union of Agricultural and Forestry Producers (MTK).
However, Mr. Hakkarainen finds some criticism in the tax reform bill.
The reduction in forest endowment is proposed to be based on the net capital income of the forest owner.
This is the capital gain minus any other deductions.
MTK and Hakkarainen argue that the tax reduction would be more effective if it could be deducted directly from the sales of wood.
The Commission notes that the Commission has not provided any information on the amount of the tax deduction for the period 2014-2020.
Such a person would receive a tax credit even if he did not sell the timber.
The model is too complicated.
The average forest owner cannot see it, says Hakkarainen.
Moreover, he says, the model only affects a small percentage of forest owners.
The limit for the tax reduction linked to the value of the forest is EUR 40 000.
It's been pulled too high by the Hacksaw.
As such, he says, it will remove 82% of Finnish forest owners from the reduction zone.
The model would have an impact on about 10% of the forestry community, he says.
The VM considers that the limit guarantees the aim of in-house farming.
In forest policy, the reduction of forest loss has been taken for decades, according to Hakkarainen.
The reason for this is the ageing of the forestry community.
According to the MTK, the average age of forest owners is currently over 60 years old, and about half of forest owners are retired.
A powerful wildfire has caught the motorists on the Himalayan Highway . Two cars have slid into a ditch and collided with each other .
A fisherman on the Himalayan River had a strange encounter with a whale on Friday morning.
According to the rescue service, two cars in a row crashed into a ditch, followed by a rear-end collision with the one in front.
According to the Daily Fire Chief, Harry Pyszy, the suspected cause of the crash was a violent scuffle.
Two people were in the car behind, both of whom were taken to the hospital for treatment.
There's no further information on their injuries.
The driver of the car that was hit earlier was not injured.
The accident happened on Highway 8 a few kilometers from Himanga to Kalajoki.
Finnish research could help improve cancer treatment
Recent research by researchers at the University of Turku may help to develop more effective cancer treatments.
The findings of the research team of Academy Professor Johanna Ivaska show that the hardness of the cancer tumor increases the malignancy.
Many human tissues, such as breast tissue, are very soft, and tissue cells grow normally in this environment.
According to Iwaska, the cancer was prevented from growing in the laboratory by restoring the tissue surrounding the cancer to a normal, soft tissue.
In the future, cancer treatment may be improved by focusing on the interaction between the cells and the surrounding tissue, rather than on the cancer cells themselves.
The study was published on August 4 in the respected journal Nature Communications, which focuses on cell biology.
The murder of Muhos' family continues to be blamed on the court, the prosecutor also demands the death penalty for the other perpetrator
The trial of the Muhus family continues in the court for both convicts.
Two young men were sentenced to prison in June for the murder of a family member in Muhoks.
The other received eight years and four months for, among other things, murder and aggravated robbery committed as a young person.
The other is serving a 12-year sentence for murder and aggravated robbery committed as a juvenile.
The convicted murderer was also convicted of gross endangerment of road safety as a young person and of driving a vehicle while under the influence as a young person.
The prosecutor, the plaintiffs, and the man who received the harsher sentence all appealed against the high court's decision.
The prosecution is seeking a reduced sentence for a man convicted of murder as a juvenile, to 12 years in prison.
They were in their full senses at the time of the crime.
According to the district court, 17-year-old boys killed a man who worked as a supervisor in the school's child protection unit last July.
A 17-year-old convicted of murder was found guilty of assaulting a driver sitting on a sofa in the back of the living room.
The director had let go of his grip and led the youth to his room, when another youth beat him with a straw.
The conductor was also strangled with a wire, beaten and kicked in the head.
According to the psychological examination, both convicts were in their right minds at the time of the crime.
The court ruled that the youths had been planning to escape from the family home since at least the previous day.
The ice shark is the world's oldest vertebrate, reproducing at only 156 years old
The world's longest living vertebrate has been confirmed to be a polar shark, according to a study published in Science magazine.
In the northern Atlantic, such as around Greenland, the ice shark, or holcker, can live up to 400 years.
The female doesn't reproduce until she's 156.
The ice's life span is enhanced by the fact that it only grows an inch a year.
Only one species of shellfish is known to outlive the ice shark.
The scientists were able to determine the age of the rock by radiocarbon dating.
Because of nuclear tests in the 1950's, some sharks had radioactive residue.
Using these, the researchers were able to estimate the age of the sharks.
The oldest was estimated to be 392 years old - although the toss may be as high as 120 years.
Donald Trump as an economic expert
The America of Donald Trump doesn't need to change the world.
Even a third of all government tax revenues would be lost if the corporate tax reforms pushed by Donald Trump were implemented.
Tax revenues would also be reduced, especially by tax breaks that would benefit the richest.
Trump described his tax plan as revolutionary when he introduced it Monday in Detroit.
The corporate tax rate would be reduced from 35 percent to 15 percent.
Without it, we would be left with a staggering amount of money, a trillion dollars a year.
The top income tax rate is now 39.6 percent after Trump's proposed discount of 33.
The estate tax would be completely waived.
Trump accused the government of over-regulating the business community and driving small businesses into bankruptcy.
The environmental standards adopted by the Member States must be reviewed and the energy sector deregulated.
The health care reform bill of Barack Obama needs to be re-examined.
The management must be appointed 'by experts instead of bureaucrats'.
"Destructive" trade policies, according to Trump, are the biggest cause of America's problems.
The free trade agreements would be abandoned.
The Commission has already decided to introduce a new system of penalties for imports from China, which will be increased by 45%, and Mexico, by 35%.
We offer a new future.
Americanism, not globalism, is our creed, Trump declared.
The America of Donald Trump doesn't need to change the world:
American cars will drive on the streets, American planes will connect the cities, American ships will control the seas, American steel will lift new skyscrapers all over the country.
Unusually, Trump faithfully read the speech written by the aides, despite being interrupted 14 times by well-organized protests.
Economists, including those close to the Republicans, see Trump's program as leading the United States into a deep recession.
Hillary Clinton released her own show early Friday, Finnish time.
A blast from the past - People's News
The sea is roaring with death, but a tidal wave is striking the streets of central Madrid - and the reckoning with the past may begin.
That, in a nutshell, is the story of Pedro Almodóvar's novelty.
Almodovar's previous directorial work, The Travellers (2013), was a small-scale and satirical comedy with a sordid side, preceded by Iho onde vivo (2011) the peak of the career of the Spanish writer.
Julieta (2016) is a work that falls somewhere between these two.
It's a conventional psychological drama of love, relationships and family, centred on the relationship between mother and daughter.
It's a simple story, and it's seen a lot in long retrospect.
Life seems to be in order for the middle-aged celebrity (Emma Suarez), but then everything threatens to collapse.
After a chance encounter, a new boyfriend (Dario Grandinetti) is left wondering until the end of the film.
In the form of a back-and-forth letter, Juliet once again passes through the stages of her life to her grown-up daughter.
She begins with the time before the birth of her daughter, the moment she met her future father (Daniel Grao).
At the same time, the second female lead is Adraina Ugarte, who plays Julieta as a young teacher, a graduate of the TV series Time Between the Lights (2013-2014).
Juliet's aging has been handled in a way that may seem corny, but I would say quite literally and verbatim with a little bit of scrubbing.
From the splash of passion that is so characteristic of Almodóvar films to the humor that is so often found in Julieta, there is a considerable distance.
It's a balanced, restrained, partly good music, and a rather sad film, with an element of elegia.
Instead, the Spanish golden eagle retains its visual colorfulness, slowly catching on, more as a mere fashion window than as a dramatic effect.
The characters in the film are affected by illness, death, or other sudden loss, but the surface remains the same.
This is especially true of the costume: in the case of the title character, the clothes change from scene to scene, and the same applies to the flashy corvettes.
Almodóvar is careful in these matters, but the main point, the tone of this very scene, is not particularly improved by this.
Mechanically, the repetition is external and a little soulless.
Almodóvar has written a screenplay based on three novels by Canadian author Alice Munro, winner of the 2013 Nobel Prize in Literature.
The novels are published in Karkulainen: Narratives.
Almodóvar has invested in dialogue, resulting in a somewhat balanced written literary film adaptation.
The material would have been emotionally incomparably more intense than the drama, the larger issues - especially the dull guilt - the film's theme deals with.
Written and directed by Pedro Almodóvar.
Based on three novels by Alice Munro.
The film is directed by Robert F. Kennedy and stars Emma Suarez, Adriana Ugarte, Rossy de Palma, Daniel Grao, and Dario Grandinetti.
The movie opens on August 12.
The government is trying to rig the election.
The new cuts will not be made, the ministers insist, so that the Finnish base does not collapse completely.
However, the cuts that are scheduled for spring are being made on a shoestring basis.
There will be no more cuts.
The four billion already decided to be saved is enough.
The Commission is also proposing to introduce a new system of taxation of the income of the EU Member States.
This is true in the sense that there are no new cuts in the VM's proposal, since the cuts in social security were decided already in the spring recess.
Child benefit, the National Pension, the basic unemployment benefit and almost all other benefits linked to the National Pension Index will be cut by 0.85%.
The duration of earnings-based unemployment benefits is reduced from 500 days to 400 days.
Training operations are continuing.
The Municipal Court is haunted
Why do the ministers insist so much on not doing any more cuts on these?
Because next year is an election year.
Municipal elections are held in April and are the most important indicator of the election season, not the Gallup polls.
It has been seen before that the municipal elections, which lead the ruling parties in different directions, ruin the mood of the government for a long time.
Gallup, however, reports that the ruling party, the Finns of the Left, is facing a crushing defeat, even though its results in the previous elections were a modest 12.3 percent compared to the parliamentary elections.
The Finns received 752 new delegates four years ago, many of whom will be paid the price for their influence in the right-wing government next spring.
The life of three parties with roughly equal numbers of voters depends on the Finns' staying in power.
Now it has not lasted, but more than half of the party voted for the need to get government policy in the first year.
The first signs of the party's parliamentary group have also surfaced.
The rhetoric of no new cuts will firstly obscure the fact that next year they will be made in a big way and secondly try to soften the attack that awaits the Finnish people.
The major surgery in 2018?
In a year, things will probably be different if the government of the Mole is still in place.
The government has set itself the goal of debt relief this term, but Petteri Orpo's budget proposal will take in €5.9 billion in debt next year, which is more than this year.
After the municipal elections, the government has two options.
The first is to raise our hands in the middle of the election campaign and admit that the government is unable to follow its own programme: the debt burden is not going to be reduced or even slowed down.
One is to stick to the program.
It means new and even more severe cuts in the 2017 budget deficit.
The budget would be at least close to balance in 2018 and then in the spring parliamentary elections, we will take what comes.
These measures do not reduce the risk of indebtedness
It is quite clear that current measures will not help to reduce debt, despite Juha Sipilä's efforts to create a positive atmosphere.
The curves presented by Secretary of State Martti Hetemäe at the budget briefing are clear evidence of this:
The forecasts for global growth have repeatedly proved to be unrealistic, meaning that there is no appeal from the international economy.
The Finnish economy has not recovered much since the 2008 collapse, except during the temporary recovery policy in the early 2010s.
Unemployment has risen by 35 percent in this decade, from an average of 34 weeks to 54 weeks.
Unemployment now costs €3 billion more per year than in 2008.
The government debt, which exceeded the 60% threshold in 2014, will rise to 70% by the middle of the next decade.
What is responsible?
In spring 2015, the Left Alliance's debt relief was rejected as irresponsible.
Next year, the cost of maintaining unemployment will be around EUR 6 billion, which will be covered almost entirely by new debt.
This is the Centre's, the Assembly's and the Finnish people's idea of what is responsible.
Question: Many tasks are left to the municipalities
Three out of four people think that the provision of childcare, youth work and physical activity is a municipal responsibility, according to a survey by the KAKS - Foundation for the Development of the Municipal Sector.
A large majority of the population also attributes responsibility for libraries, culture, civic schools, building supervision, secondary education and waste management to the individual municipality.
The responsibility of the county is clearly to be given to the county level, specialised nursing, vocational training, vocational colleges and institutional care for the mentally disabled.
No tasks of the municipalities in the area of law enforcement are to be transferred to the State.
A juvenile drunk driver ran off in a chase to escape the police.
A 16-year-old motorcyclist from Joensuu ran away from a police patrol in Joensuu on Ilomantsintie Friday night at 1:30 p.m.
The police patrol tried to stop the motorcycle without lights, but the young man went to drive away the police fairly high speed.
The pursuit continued to the Sunshine Coast Road, then to the Sorrona Road and a smaller forest road, where the motorcycle ran off the road.
After this, the young man ran away, but a faster-paced policeman caught up with the fugitive.
The breath test on the driver showed 0.75 promille.
He also did not have a driver's license that would have authorized him to ride a motorcycle.
The case is being investigated as a serious threat to road safety.
A truck in a quarry fell into a ditch.
A truck with a pile of stones fell into a ditch on the road at Polvijärvi, Kavintie, on Thursday night at 21.15.
The truck had veered off the road in a left-handed curve and had crashed into a ditch.
The rescue team lifted the injured driver out of the fallen truck through the door above, along with the rescue helicopter crew and paramedics.
The lifting of the vehicle was left to the owner.
A hydraulic oil leaked from a collapsed trailer onto the road and was absorbed by the rescue system into the peat.
Police are investigating the cause of the accident.
An old woman went missing this afternoon on the River of Air.
An 87-year-old woman has been missing since this afternoon in the village of Lahden in the southern Netherlands.
Police are looking for a woman about 5'5", thin, fair-haired, with white hair that reaches down to her chin.
For any information on the disappeared, please call the Nordic Situation Centre on 0295440513.
The materials of the Great Catastrophe in the air - see the photo gallery of the destruction of Parafest
The torrential downpour that toppled the Parafest festival tents caused widespread destruction.
The chairman of the Joensuun Parafest Association, Arto Pippuri, believes that the festival will be able to get on its feet financially and that the event can be held again next year.
The last act of the Parafest, Kalle Salonen, performed at the end of the Friday night at the market square.
On Saturday, the program will continue with performances in the City Theater, beginning at 1 p.m.
There's a Parafest exhibition at the Ahjo Arts Center at 1:15.
The program will go as planned.
The runoff is created in a thunderstorm cloud when rainwater and its pressure trigger a downward airflow.
Changes in the water pattern of the cloud of steam trap the heat, and thus the descending air cools and accelerates its velocity toward the ground.
The Finnish Meteorological Institute reports that there are several torrential flows in Finland during the summer.
The path of the downstream currents is difficult to predict.
The downpour hit the backyard of the Joensuu Art Museum, where the Parafest was held, Friday afternoon before five.
Three tents collapsed, with about 200 people in the tents.
Four people were slightly injured in the accident.
One child was transported to a hospital with minor injuries for further treatment.
Air pollution aging Londoners
A study shows that Londoners age faster than normal.
The reason for skin aging is air pollution.
The British investigation is in the Evening Standard.
British skin-care company Caci analysed the most toxic particles in London's air and their effects on the skin.
The results show that the skin of many Londoners of retirement age is two and a half years older than that of their rural peers.
The tiny particles that age the skin are a very fine dust dust, derived from transport fuels.
The same particles also cause respiratory illnesses that, according to the Evening Standard, kill nearly 9,500 Londoners each year.
Studies have shown that the particles are small enough to penetrate the outermost layer of the skin.
The CAC study found that premature aging is a risk, particularly for Londoners who commute by walking in the vicinity of busy streets.
Londoners can try to protect themselves from air pollution by wearing masks, for example, but more practical solutions include regular skin cleansing.
The tractor brakes failed to stop the man standing in front of it.
The man had moved rocks from his yard with a tractor.
After he got out of the tractor and went to walk in front of it, the tractor's brakes failed and the tractor ran over the man.
The man was not hit, but the tractor pushed him enough to have him transported to the central hospital for further examination with serious injuries.
The tractor had no time to go any further, because it hit the rocks in front.
I 'm renewed in strength for the season to come
The South African Liiga-Riento, playing in the Football League, will start the series in October with a better starting position than anyone has ever seen.
The team has been together for almost three weeks.
The overall tone is certainly better than in the previous seasons, when the series has been dark for Rienne.
Jani Säsä, who will remain as head coach of Rienn, praises the new team for their enthusiasm and unity.
The third-place finisher, Fred Musoni, will start his second season in Rienne.
The new faces are 23-year-old Murangwa Nelson and Hiago Garchet.
Nelson, who played for the Rwanda national team, is a 6'2" (205 cm) hacker.
The Garchet is a similar bird, the Brazilian measuring 198 centimetres.
Through Josba, Kataja and Jokipoike to the US national team
Anne Jumppanen has played in almost every World Sailing Championship since 2003.
Now in Tampere, the sixth edition of the Games is underway, with only 2013 missing after Canada's performance in the North American qualifiers.
I was working in Turku and playing with the ladies in the pig farm when I saw the ad.
The U.S. was about to form a national team for salibandy.
I got interested and here we are, Jumppanen, 48, says.
Jumppanen was born in Elizabeth, New York, in 1967.
The family moved to Helsinki when she was one year old.
In 1987, Jumppanen was admitted to the University of Joensuu to study computer science.
When I came to Joensuu, there was no such sport as salibandy at the SM level.
They used to play the game of chess in college.
I played basketball at Kataja and later played hockey for the Jokipoj in the SM-series, Jumppanen remembers.
Jumppanen played for the university team in the salibandy SM series in the 1991-92 season, the next three seasons were spent in Jos.
And besides playing, she coached the A-girls to the championship.
The women's SM series topped out with silver in 1995.
In total, Jumppanen played in the women's SM series for 10 seasons, with a total of 169 matches, 51+34=85.
The last SM season was 2001-2002.
Perttu Puska and Tatu Väänänen were named to the national team
Josba, a salibandy player from Joensuu, was trained by Perttu Puska and Tatu Väänänen, a salibandy player from Enola, was selected to play for the Finnish national team, which will play in the EFT tournament in Brno, Czech Republic, from 6 to 8 November.
The 25-year-old attacker Perttu Puska has played in six men's international matches in which he has accumulated a total of 9+4=13 points.
The 32-year-old defender from Wiler-Ersigen in Switzerland, Tatu Väänänen, has recovered from a hip injury and is now a regular member of the national team with 117 international matches under his belt.
The national team also included Mika Kohonen, a cornerback for the Seinäjoen Pelivelyt, who was last seen in a Finnish shirt at the World Cup in December.
The head coach of the Salibandy national team is Petri Kettunen from Kontiolahti.
Beach volleyball star Essi Hasu's circle closes in the Kowloon - SM gold missing from the trophy vault
Essi Hasu is about to retire as a beach volleyball player, at least temporarily, after this season.
The Finnish Beach Volleyball Championships will be decided this weekend at the Kouvola Sports Park.
Over the course of three days, medals will be played in both the adult and junior divisions.
The six best pairs in each ranking are qualified for the SM final tournament, organized in cooperation with Kouvola's Volleyball Players and the Finnish Volleyball Federation.
The local team is represented by Elimäen NMKY's Essi Hasu, who has been a member of the Finnish beach volleyball elite for many years.
Hasu, now living in Helsinki, eagerly awaits games in front of familiar audiences.
I hope as many people as possible get into the auditorium this weekend.
I'm sure there's a great arena coming to Pesis Stadium.
I don't play much in the big leagues, so it's nice to play in the finals on home soil, Hasu.
The Kouvola region sparked Has's interest in sports and provided a fine springboard for a fine hobby.
I have a lot of memories of my childhood.
I started volleyball at the age of nine with the E-girls of Elimäe NMKY.
The main thing is the oversized jersey, the knee pads that twist at the ankles, and the big shouts and choreographies after the point, Hasu recalls.
In a small community, the sports club was a tight-knit community where everyone knew each other.
The spirit of the team was to create an environment where it was fun to play.
All the families were very involved - the father of a teammate coached us, and our mother was the long-time president of the club.
Essi Hasulle beach volleyball was a natural rival to indoor volleyball as a junior.
The whirlpool beach has been the home of the whirlpool beat since the 1990s.
The mob has always been active.
I also watched the junior SM tour, hoping that one day I would be there to play.
Now this dream comes true when Hasu plays a weekend together with Anniina Parkkis from Blekinge in the SM finals.
The goal of the second-ranked team in the tournament, after Riikka Lehtosen and Taru Lahti, is clear.
As a realistic goal, we have a medal.
We're still short of the SM gold in the trophy case, Hasu throws mysteriously.
This weekend's performance at the Kouvola may be the last time Hasou will ever be seen in public.
As September begins, new challenges await you in your civil service.
I'm sure the international career will be over after the Tournament of the Tooth.
And the toe-snappers are put on the nail, at least temporarily, Hasu plans.
The accidental flow of water overturned tents at the disabled event in Joensuu, a major accident was near
A falling tide knocked down three tents at the Parafest festival for the disabled in Joensuu.
According to Karjalainen newspaper, four people were injured in the accident.
One child was taken to the hospital for further treatment.
According to the Karjala, there were about 200 people in the tents.
In one of the larger tents, a performance was taking place.
Two of the tents were smaller.
The accident happened Friday at 5:00 p.m.
The fire chief, Markus Viitaniemi, interviewed by Karjalainen, told the magazine that the situation was a major accident.
The paper says the outcome of the event is in doubt.

Solomon Koli took a bold step toward becoming a farmer
Agriculture as an entrepreneurial enterprise means risk-taking, diligence and energy.
Salomon Koli, a young farmer of 25, became an entrepreneur in agriculture because he believed in a positive future in the countryside.
Koli started about two years ago with his little brother, Walter Kol, as a continuation of their home farm.
Their father, Markus Koli, helps and advises the brothers from his own experience.
Starting as a farmer meant taking on debt and expanding the farm to make a living from farming.
This has been my thing since I was a little boy.
I've always enjoyed working on a farm, and now that I've started my own business, I've put everything on the line.
If you're gonna start something, I think you should do it seriously and properly.
In 2013, we went to build a patio water system, and at first, the bank wasn't too keen on it either.
However, I was very brave to join the project and have been fully involved in it", says Salomon Koli, adding that he would not have taken action if he did not believe in the production of clean Finnish food and that everything will turn out well.
Salomon Kol, a meat carrier, is looking to invest in an even bigger pool.
The work has paid off, as Salomon Koli has been selected as one of the top ten in the Maudunase Tulevaisuus magazine's competition for young food producers.
Right now, he's racing for a chance to win.
He can vote on the magazine's website until August 21.
Bulgaria reports inflation for the first time in eight months
National statistics show that inflation in Bulgaria was 1% in July.
This is the highest figure in years (since June 2012) and the first above zero figure since October last year, when a positive 0.2% was reported.
The annual average inflation rate, measured by the cost of living index, was -0,8% over the last 12 months (August 2015 - July 2016) compared to the previous 12 months (August 2014 - July 2015).
The cost of living index for July 2016 was 101,0% compared to June 2016, i.e. monthly inflation was 1,0%.
The Commission notes that the Commission has not provided any information on the level of the measures in force.
Compared to the previous month, the following consumer goods showed an increase in price in July 2016: food and non-alcoholic beverages (1.7%), transport (1.8%), leisure and culture (6.3%), restaurants and hotels (1.2%), mixed goods and services (0.3%).
Prices fell in clothing and footwear (2.2%), furniture, household goods and routine maintenance (0.5%) and health (0.1%).
Prices remained at the same level as in the previous month for alcoholic beverages and tobacco, housing, water, electricity, gas and other fuels, communications and education.
Snapchat's "anime" campaign is being hailed as an Asian carnival
Snapchat says the anime has served as an inspiration for the filter, but some observers say it's racist.
With its Lens tool, Snapchat enables its approximately 150 million daily users to manipulate reality and play with identities in ways that are almost ridiculous.
You can turn yourself into a pineapple, a dog, or a character that would fit Roy Lichtenstein's painting.
Lenses are simple, facial-shaping tools that produce over 30 million enhanced selfies a day.
Any false step will quickly be on the public record.
Snapchat's lenses have been criticized in the past for allegedly promoting blackface masks or favoring whiter skin as a beauty product.
So when Snapchat this week advertised to some users a lens that gave them crooked eyes, crooked teeth and puffy cheeks, some critics called it a racist caricature of Asian people - yellowface.
And they wondered if these recurring polemics might be a sign of a larger company problem with diversity.
News and disgust spread widely on Wednesday with reports from The Verge and Motherboard, and a day later Snapchat said it had discontinued the feature.
The company offered an explanation: The lens was intended as a tribute to anime characters, not to caricatures of Asians.
But for observers who have experienced racism, the lens was a reminder of the offensive stereotypes at work.
Others vehemently opposed the anime comparison.
Grace Sparapani, a Korean-American art student whose tweet about the photographs was widely shared, said in an email that the lens was "at the very least offensive and uncomfortable".
He added that it was difficult to argue against the comparison with the combination of a bold Asian cartoon and filter effects.
It shows that the filter is not just a yellow-brown, but a yellow-brown when used to extreme paralysis.
Snapchat isn't the only company that crosses these cultural traps.
American culture seems to be caught in an endless struggle for diversity and inclusion, from the boardrooms of corporations to Hollywood and the devices we all carry in our hands.
And Snapchat's huge, racially diverse audience of young people may mean that they're even more likely to expect an understanding attitude.
In an interview Thursday, 25-year-old Katie Zhu said that when one of Snapchat's lenses creates an offensive image, "it's much harder for these guys to be unnoticed".
Thursday, Zhu, a product manager and engineer working for Medium, decided to delete his Snapchat account and urged others to do the same.
In a post to Medium and in a phone interview, he said he believed the controversy over race reflected a lack of diversity in Snapchat's hiring practices.
Zhu criticized the company's predominantly white male leadership and ended his post with the hashtag #DeleteSnapchat
Or they don't have a diverse representation of different skin colours on their staff, which is why they are able to make these kinds of decisions, said Chinese-American Zhu, or they have representatives of different skin colours on the job, but they're not in positions where they feel safe or can speak up.
Other observers share his opinion, a complaint that Snapchat has largely left unanswered.
The company does not publish figures on the diversity of its workforce, noting its status as a private company.
On Thursday, Snapchat declined to discuss the racial makeup of its staff, but according to a spokesperson, the company recently hired a recruiter to focus on underrepresented populations and push forward internal inclusion efforts.
Zhu, for his part, said that he kept his Snapchat account closed, adding: "The fact is, they actually need more users like us to say that this is not okay".
The congressional panel found that military officers were misrepresenting ISIS intelligence.
In a report released Thursday, a congressional panel said officials at the headquarters of the U.S. military's war department had manipulated intelligence reports to present a more optimistic picture of the war against ISIS in Iraq and Syria than what was being done on the ground.
The interim report of the task force, which was established by the Republican chair of the House of Representatives Defense Committee, the Intelligence Committee, and the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee, found "widespread dissatisfaction" among intelligence analysts at HQ, who said that their superiors tampered with their assessments of American efforts to defeat ISIS.
Headquarters, known as Centcom, is the headquarters of the Army Warfare Command in Tampa, Florida, which oversees U.S. military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
The intelligence findings approved by senior Centcom leaders typically gave a more positive picture of US counter-terrorism efforts than the facts on the ground justified, and were regularly more positive than the analyses produced by other elements of the intelligence community, the report's press release said.
"Centcom's actions are unacceptable - our fighters in the war are suffering when bad analyses are presented to high-level decision-makers", said Representative Ken Calvert, R-Calif.
The failures of the Centcom leadership are spreading right to the top of the organization.
The tenth report details the recurring problems with the headquarters descriptions and analysis of the US efforts to train Iraqi forces in 2014 and 2015.
While it doesn't provide clear evidence that senior Obama administration officials ordered the reports to be tampered with, it does describe how analysts felt pressured by Centcom leaders to portray the threat of the Islamic State, ISIS, in a more positive light.
Throughout the first half of 2015, many headquarters press releases, statements and testimony to Congress were significantly more positive than the events themselves, the report said.
For example, a Centcom official publicly stated that a major offensive to recapture Mosul could begin as early as April or May 2015.
Mosul, Iraq's second largest city, is still under ISIS control.
"After months of investigation, this is very clear", said Representative Mike Pompeo, Republican of Kansas, in a statement.
From mid-2014 to mid-2015, the top intelligence officers at the headquarters of the US military's war zone, manipulated the intelligence output of the headquarters to downplay the threat of ISIS in Iraq.
The Republicans created the task force after hearing analysts raise concerns that intelligence on the Islamic State was being manipulated.
The report, released on Thursday, will be followed by more extensive findings as the investigation continues.
The DOD inspector general has begun an additional ongoing investigation into the Centcom intelligence.
On Thursday, the Democratic members of the House Intelligence Committee released their own findings, which were consistent with some of the final conclusions of the Republican task force.
"In 2014 and 2015, Centcom created an unnecessarily isolated process from the intelligence assessments of ISIS and Iraqi security forces", Representative Adam B. Schiff, the committee's lead Democrat, said in a statement.
According to Schiff, this process 'extended the release of intelligence information', 'worsened the mood among analysts' and 'did not allow enough room for different points of view'.
Schiff and the Democrats said they found no evidence that the White House had tried to pressure Centcom analysts to reconcile their conclusions to a "pre-set or political narrative".
The Daily Beast will report on Tuesday on the preliminary results of the congressional investigation.
Last August, The New York Times reported that the Pentagon's inspector general had begun an investigation after complaints from Centcom analysts.
Captain Patrick Evans, a Pentagon spokesman, said in a statement that the Department of Defense would not comment on the congressional report as long as the inspector general's investigation was ongoing.
But he said that "experts sometimes disagree on the interpretation of complex data, and the intelligence community and the Department of Defense welcome healthy dialogue on these vital national security issues".
The investigation has implications beyond the question of whether the US-led bombing campaign in Iraq and Syria is successful (as a growing number of defence officials now claim).
Last year's allegations questioned how much President Obama can trust the White House to provide honest assessments of the war effort in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other hot spots.
The criticism of Islamic State intelligence reflects a controversy more than a decade ago when Centcom intelligence analyst Gregory Hooker wrote a research article stating that despite the objections of many analysts, the administration of President George W. Bush favored a small military presence in Iraq and spent very little time considering the consequences of the 2003 invasion.
Hooker was also a key player in the insurgency over the Islamic State's intelligence.
Last year, officials said Hooker's group concluded that despite public statements to the contrary, the crackdown on refineries controlled by the Islamic State had not significantly weakened the terrorist group's finances because it had built makeshift refineries to sell oil on the black market.
The Times reported in September that this discovery was not reported outside the headquarters.
The then commander of Centcom, General Lloyd J. Austin III, came under fire last year after many lawmakers considered his testimony to the Senate an overly positive assessment of the war.
General Austin retired in April and was replaced at headquarters by General Joseph L. Votel.
The United States wins its fourth straight women 's ice hockey title by hosting a rematch with Great Britain .
A day after scoring three goals in a 6-1 win over Japan, Katie Bam scored the first two goals on Thursday for the U.S. women's hockey team in a 3-0 win over India.
Scoring five goals in two games sounds like an unforgettable feat, but Bam, 27, said he wasn't sure he'd done it before.
"I have no idea", he said.
I'm not really the kind of person who keeps a record of his paintings.
But he knows this: The Americans are 4-0 down in the Olympic tournament and they share their group lead with Great Britain, who were still unbeaten after beating Japan 2-0 on Thursday.
Great Britain and the United States will face off on Saturday in the final game of the first round.
Both teams have made it to the quarterfinals, and this game will determine who will be first and second in their six-team group.
The first-placed team will avoid the strong Dutch, the leader of the second group, a little longer at the beginning of the quarterfinals.
Whatever the outcome of Saturday's game, the Americans have stirred controversy with their surprising success here, four years after they finished last out of 12 teams at the London Olympics.
Bam was on that team.
He grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, and picked up a field hockey stick for the first time at the age of 3 (his older twin brothers played the sport at Drexel) before joining the national team at the age of 16, becoming its youngest player ever.
She did not compete in the 2008 Summer Olympics because she did not make the final roster.
In 2012, nothing went smoothly for him and his teammates.
The following year, Englishman Craig Parnham was appointed as the coach, and things began to change.
"Cultural change, spiritual change, physical change", said Bam.
We didn't have the same workload in London as we have now.
We've made a complete turn.
On Thursday night, Bam started the first half with a touchdown pass to the quarterback.
India had come into the game without a single win in the tournament, but the team was surprisingly strong and held the lead at 1-0 until the end of the third period, when Bam took control.
He carried the ball a long way to the left side of the court, then he rolled in the middle and scored, leading the Americans 2-0.
Melissa Gonzalez added the final touchdown in the middle of the fourth inning.
This zero-sum game was the first of the tournament for U.S. goalkeeper Jackie Briggs, who had conceded one goal in each of the first three victories.
He's in a good mood.
So is Bam.
'We have a good situation now', said Parnham, 'but its goodness depends on the outcome of Saturday's game.
A peaceful trampoline in the middle of the Olympic Games
Wherever you are, whatever time it is, the Olympics are on.
The events in Rio de Janeiro seem to be continuous and inevitable, a message of fierce competition and struggle.
It is as if the Olympic torch itself were a flaming chalice handed from archer to swimmer and gymnast to triathlete.
It's impossible to turn on the television, read the newspaper, or listen to a conversation with a neighbor in the cafeteria without hearing about Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky, or the feud between Michael Phelps and Chad Le Clos.
And then there's Logan Dooley.
Dooley, a first-time Olympian and future heart-wrencher with a smile, could well be one of those household names featured on prime-time television and endorsed by sponsorship deals and good-natured TV commercials - if he were a swimmer, a gymnast or even a fighter.
But Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, is competing for Olympic gold in trampoline.
The Olympic torch doesn't illuminate all sports as much.
Farther from the center, partly in the shadows, are the sports that are not universally accepted: air pistol shooting, archery, badminton, taekwondo.
We always have a chest, long live the one.
But if I may make a modest number of my particular favorites, I would like to draw attention to the restrained charm of the trampoline.
Although trampoline has been an Olympic sport since 2000, when it made its debut at the Sydney Games, its presence has been so little noticed during the past 16 years that many of those I interviewed did not realize that it was an Olympic sport at all.
This could be a regional ignorance.
Although the United States has sent athletes to compete in the event, it has never won a medal, and its athlete did not advance to the final until 2012.
The Chinese and Russians usually share the men's medals, the Chinese and Canadians the women's medals.
This year, China's Dong Dong and Canada's Rosie McLennan will defend their gold medals in London.
There is, however, a certain understated appeal to the trampoline, in part because to the uneducated ear it sounds more like clown school than the Olympics.
I have to admit that I'm not an expert on this, I'm just a fan of the flying bug.
The possibilities of fun, as seen in the vibrations of the endless cartoon pumps, are also found in the sport, but there is also the complexity of gymnastics and swimming, two sports that are essentially combined.
The word "trampoline" comes from the Spanish word el trampolín, which means trampoline.
The championship hoppers will jump on a giant trampoline to heights of nearly 30 feet, and they must perform a series of tortuous movements (turns, bends, and volts) before finally landing on their feet.
According to the official Olympic programme, they are judged on their performance, difficulty and 'flight time'.
In Rio, 32 athletes from 17 countries will compete, 16 men and 16 women.
The most common Olympic orientation is straight forward.
Those who want a medal must go farther, faster, higher and higher, sometimes to the finish line, sometimes back and forth across the field.
They are not only chasing the finish line or the starting wall, but also, in the televised news, the other, grim frontier: the world or Olympic record.
This determined pursuit is noble, admirable, even fanatical - and it can even bring tears to the viewer.
But it's also why watching the games can be a little bit exhausting.
The trampoline is offering a moment of rest.
The trampoline is up.
The goal is not to move forward.
The competitor ascends to a new level, seemingly weightless like an astronaut, goes up, then down, then effortlessly back up.
Of course, there is no competition or difficulty, but there is no furious rush to the finish line, no leaps into the distance, just a dreamlike, mellow interruption of time and gravity.
It's as close to zen as the Olympics can get.
The women's qualifying tournament and then the final will be held on Friday afternoon with the broadcast beginning at 1 pm ET, with the men's competition coming on Saturday also at 1 pm.
NBC will broadcast the finals as part of their afternoon programming beginning at 2:00 p.m. both days.
In the midst of the Olympic frenzy, they provide a quiet, enchanting moment that is most likely to go unnoticed in the general chaos.
And if consciousness is achieved only by offering male athletes to be stared at and objectified (as U.S. male bodybuilders recently suggested, according to The Wall Street Journal), Dooley is just waiting for his new fan club to howl.
A generation is showing its sympathy for Ethiopia, a longtime U.S. ally
Violent protests in Ethiopia
Protesters demanding political change in Ethiopia have faced violent opposition from the government.
Eyewitnesses say dozens of protesters have been shot dead in clashes with police.
Ethiopia is about to break?
Over the past decade, it has been one of the most stable states in Africa, a strong ally of the West, with a rapidly growing economy.
However, in recent months, anti-government protests have rocked the country, spreading to more and more areas.
In the past week alone, thousands of people have taken to the streets to demand a fundamental political change.
Human rights groups say the government's response was ruthless.
Witnesses said that police shot and killed dozens of unarmed protesters.
Widespread video recordings of the protests, believed to be from late last year or early this year, show security officials beating young people with sticks while forcing them to stand with their hands against a wall.
The UN's top human rights authority is now calling for a full investigation.
'Keeping this country together has always been difficult, and it will be even more difficult in the future', said Rashid Abdi, Horn of Africa project manager for the International Crisis Group research group.
Ethiopia is Africa's second most populous country after Nigeria, and its stability is appreciated by Western countries.
American military and intelligence services are working closely with Ethiopians to combat regional terror threats, particularly in Somalia, and hardly any African country receives as much Western support.
Ethiopia's economy has grown at an impressive rate.
Its infrastructure has been vastly improved, and the capital city, Addis Ababa, even has a new commuter train.
City streets are typically quiet, safe, and clean.
But while Ethiopia has not been a model of democracy, human rights groups have consistently spoken of government oppression, the country's opposition has been limited, and dissent has been effectively silenced.
Many have been deported, imprisoned, killed, or driven far into the desert.
But this may be about to change.
"If you repress people and they have no choice but to express themselves, this is what will happen", said Seyoum Teshome, a university teacher from central Ethiopia.
The whole youth movement is showing its mind.
One generation is showing its opinion.
The grievances are diverse and cover everything from land use to strangulation by the ruling coalition.
After the much-criticized elections last year, the ruling party and its allies won the last opposition seat and now hold all the seats in parliament.
At the same time, tensions are rising on the border with Eritrea, where fighting along this tense and disputed border claimed hundreds of lives in June.
Analysts fear that separatist groups such as the Oromo Liberation Front or the Ogaden National Liberation Front, which have been more or less defeated in recent years, may try to use the unrest to their advantage and rearm.
Numerous factors explain why, after years of simmering beneath the surface, bitter feelings are now about to explode.
The first seems harmless: smartphones.
It is only in the last few years that a large number of Ethiopians have been able to communicate through social media, as cheaper smartphones have become more common and internet service has improved.
Even if the government blocks access to Facebook and Twitter, as it often does, especially during protests, many people can still communicate their location through hidden network intermediaries.
Many young Ethiopians said that this is how they gathered for demonstrations.
Second, Ethiopia's two largest ethnic groups, the Oromo and the Amhara, are getting along better.
The Oromo and the Amhara are not natural allies.
For a long time, the Amharas, who come from the predominantly Christian highlands of Ethiopia, prospered in politics and business by exploiting the Oromo, many of whom are Muslim and live in the lowlands.
But this is changing, too.
'We are on the way to organising under one umbrella' said Mulatu Gemechu, the leader of the Oromo people.
The biggest protests have been in the Amhara and Oromo areas.
Many of the Amhara and Oromos believe that Ethiopia is unfairly ruled by members of the Tigre people, who make up about six percent of the population and control the military, intelligence, commerce and politics.
The third cause of the unrest is the loss of Meles Zenawi.
Meles, a former rebel leader, was Ethiopia's prime minister for 17 years until he died of a secret illness in 2012.
He was considered a tactical genius, a man who saw around corners.
Analysts say he was particularly adept at detecting early signs of dissatisfaction and using secret emissaries to pacify opponents.
"The current administration has no basic instinct like that", said conflict analyst Abdi.
The new Prime Minister of Ethiopia, Hailemariam Desalegn, was chosen as a relative unknown to fill Meles's boots.
Unlike Meles, who was from the Tigre region in northern Ethiopia, Hailemariam is from the south.
Analysts say the security services controlled by the Tigers don't trust him.
Many fear that this may lead to increased bloodshed.
The last time Ethiopia experienced such chaos was in 2005, when thousands demonstrated in an election that analysts said appeared to be first rigged and then looted by the government.
The ensuing violence left many protesters dead, though fewer than in recent months, and the period of unrest passed relatively quickly.
Development experts have praised Ethiopian leaders for visionary infrastructure design, such as the new work train, and for significant progress in the fight against poverty.
But this has clearly not stopped the growing contempt for the Ethiopian government inside the country.
And now it's starting to take a dangerous ethnic form.
Last month, protesters in the Amhara town of Gondar attacked businesses owned by tigers, and anti-tigers hatred is becoming more prevalent on social media.
Analysts say the protests will put the United States and other Western powers in a bind.
The American government has used Ethiopia as a base for air strikes into neighboring Somalia, although it recently said it had closed this base.
While the West clearly wants to support democracy, it also does not want its already unstable ally in the region to collapse.
This, Abdi said, is the real balancing act.
Donald Trump explains his Obama-based Isis claim as "sarcasm"
Donald J. Trump tried to suppress his latest campaign controversy on Friday by claiming that he was not being serious when he repeatedly this week suggested that President Obama and Hillary Clinton were the "founders" of the Islamic State terrorist group.
The discovery has raised new questions about the Republican presidential candidate's ability to communicate clearly to the American public.
It also put his advocates, who have scrambled to defend him during a tumultuous period, in a difficult position of having to explain remarks that he may not have meant.
After the hint made at the campaign rally on Wednesday, Trump made the same claim with increasing fervor in interviews on Thursday, in which he insisted that his intention was indeed to say that the president and Clinton created ISIS.
In an early Friday morning tweet, however, Trump said he was only being sarcastic.
The post was a complete reversal from the previous day, when Trump said in several interviews that he was indeed serious about the accusation.
When conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt tried to help Trump deflect his remarks by reminding him that Obama wants to destroy ISIS, the Republican presidential candidate took him up on the offer.
The latest storm of criticism comes as Trump has sought to refocus his campaign amid economically depressed opinion polls.
Trump and Clinton fought over the economy this week in Michigan.
On Friday, Trump tried to return to the topic.
Taking to Twitter again, he warned that Clinton's proposals would lead to higher taxes and that he found the speech boring.
Trump has used the sarcasm defense before.
In late July, after he faced widespread criticism for apparently suggesting that the Russians should hack into Clinton's emails, he later explained his remarks by saying "Of course I'm being sarcastic".
The approach allows Trump to visit the borders of a political speech and then return when necessary.
'I think it's a model where he tests certain messages that are important to his fans, he sees how they work, and then he's 'simplifying' in one direction or another depending on the reaction,' said Ruth Sherman, a communications expert who has followed the language of both candidates.
But I also think he's smart about his statements and knows they're vague enough to be filtered through a variety of different lenses.
Instead of softening his rhetoric for a large voting audience, Trump has been more cautious in recent days as his popularity has continued to decline.
A new NBC/Wall Street Journal/Marist poll released Friday showed Trump trailing Clinton by a wide margin in North Carolina, Virginia and Colorado, and a tight race in Florida.
While Trump generally avoids apologizing for provocative statements, he often blames his critics for misinterpreting his words or misunderstanding his sense of humor.
As he faces increasing scrutiny in the final months of the presidential campaign, Trump's jokes have forced his loyal allies into an uncomfortable position where they must publicly support him no matter how provocative his remarks.
Former New York City Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, one of Trump's most prominent supporters, went to great lengths to defend the candidate in an interview with CNN on Thursday.
"I believe there are real, political comments in his words", Giuliani said when asked about the veracity of Trump's claim that Obama and Clinton founded an Islamic state.
And it's true in the sense that before Obama, ISIS was almost unknown, a small organization that he called amateur, completely wrong, and that's why this happened, because he pulled troops out of Iraq.
Most mainstream Republicans tend to argue that the Obama administration, under which Clinton served as Secretary of State, allowed ISIS to escalate because it failed to effectively manage the situation in the Middle East.
Before Friday's meetings in Pennsylvania, Trump continued his attack on Twitter against the news media that booed him on every word and was biased against him.
He mocked the "poor, pathetic" television pundits who tried to get his head around him, saying "They can't do it!"
Some Democrats mocked Trump's excuse as new evidence that he's unfit to be president.
The formerly closed coffee shop returns to Greenpoint
The Verb Cafe was a noisy, cash-only place in Williamsburg that didn't have Wi-Fi, but it served good coffee for 15 years.
Naturally, the Bedford Avenue sidewalk was too expensive for him.
The store that replaced Verbe in the summer of 2014, Soap Cherie, sells a cupcake-shaped soap.
The locals mourned it as the latest loss in a city being redeveloped as middle class.
Artist Molly Crabapple tweeted: "New York is changing, I know, but I still can't believe that CBGB is dead and Chelsea Hotel is demolished and Verb is now a soap store".
But if New York is change, it's also reinvention.
The revived Verb opened last November in Greenpoint, less than a mile from its original location.
The new Verb has Wi-Fi and credit cards, but some of the staff is still the same, and it's the same unrefined atmosphere.
And the coffee's still good.
The new Verbi is led by Cisco Rodriguez, a longtime employee of the old café who is the owner and CEO of the new place.
He started at Verb in 2001, and he was there till the end.
When a client offered to finance him in a new place, he said he was thrilled.
Rodriguez, 36, kept a lot of things the same.
Verb uses the same bagel supplier and bought the same espresso machine.
It even used the old Verbe lights.
But Rodriguez said he wanted to try it, too.
He brought in new ingredients.
The menu includes bacon, chicken, egg, and cheese sandwiches, and the toppings include capricorn and brown onions.
There's brown rice in the bowls.
The cafe no longer serves beer, but they make fresh juices.
In the nine months since he's been here, Rodriguez says he's noticed a steady stream of old regulars.
"Williamsburg was too expensive for many of our former clients", he said.
One of the last Sundays, Rebecca Oliveira was one of these customers.
Oliveira, 34, used to live in Williamsburg and was a regular at Verb.
Even after he moved to Greenpoint, he was a wanderer in the coffee shop.
He says that after Verbe shut down, he gave up coffee for a while.
'I realized that I enjoy Verbi's coffee and culture', he said.
Now he has returned to coffee, although that day he ordered a mixed chai, one of the new additions, instead of his usual iced coffee.
Another long-time customer, Tom Rosenthal, had been a loyal Verb customer since 2003.
He used to work there, and he always ordered the same thing.
"Every day at five past seven, regularly like a clock, I would go in and they would make spices with my bagel", he said.
Rodriguez said he wanted to experiment and add new ingredients to the menu.
Today, Rosenthal still orders his usual, but sometimes, for a change, he orders a spicy bagel with bacon, eggs, and cheese.
Rodriguez says he has no hard feelings about the soap shop taking over the old premises.
In fact, the owners of Soap Cherie offered to make Verbille special soap, with the use of the coffee's iced coffee as an ingredient.
"I think we can still take the offer", Rodriguez said.
And the traditional Polish residents of Greenpoint have also approved the cafe.
One of these new customers translated the menu into Polish, and Rodriguez said that he plans to put it up somewhere soon to make his new neighbors feel welcome.
There are other advantages to the new location.
The local juice place wants to bottle and sell cold brew coffee.
It's possible the cafe will expand into the building next door.
A lot of people just want to get their old favorites in the new Verb.
Joseph Whitt was a regular customer and said he was devastated when the place closed.
When the new place opened, Whitt said he felt like he had come home when he walked in and ordered coffee.
"I've been wanting to smell it", he said.
A Square Meal: A food that paralyses the season
In March of 1933, shortly after becoming president, Franklin Delano Roosevelt sat down to lunch in his office room.
As a delicacy, President Roosevelt enjoyed the finer things of Fifth Avenue, such as goose liver pastry and Maryland's swamp rabbit.
On that day, his diet was more modest: stuffed eggs in tomato sauce, potatoes, and, for dessert, bone broth.
'It was a demonstration of culinary solidarity with people who suffered,' said Jane Ziegelman.
Her husband, Andrew Coe, added: "It was also a message to Americans about how to eat".
The couple in Brooklyn Heights are food historians.
Coe's last book, Chop Suey, was about Chinese food in America, and Ziegelman told about life in a Lower East Side apartment building through food in his book, 97 Orchard.
Their latest collaboration, A Square Meal, which Harper's is publishing on Tuesday, is a history of American food during the Great Depression of the 1930s.
In a show of some sort of culinary solidarity, they meet for dinner at Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop, a small, uncluttered lunch bar in the Flatiron district that has been in operation since the 1929 stock market crash.
Ziegelman, 54, ordered a fresh-cheese olive sandwich, and Coe, 57, took a serving of turkey, potato sauce and vegetables.
When the reporter ordered a meat loaf, the couple thought it appropriate to discuss eating the lamb.
'The cartoons were very popular', said Ziegelman.
There was peanut butter, liver butter, bean curd.
They were made from the ingredient and some cheap ingredient that was added to the actual ingredient.
Imagine eating so many peanuts that they'd be your dinner.
Coe was laughing.
"It must have felt like a leaded iron in your stomach", he said.
In the years before the Depression, the tables of Americans, especially in rural areas, were like the eat-a-much-like-eat-all-you-can-eat-all-you-can-eat-all-you-can-eat table.
Groups of women prepared food for male farm workers, and freshly baked pie was served for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.
Americans sent food to starving Europeans during World War I. A Square Meal chronicles the ways in which the nation survived the sudden loss of its abundance.
"At that time, food became a central, distressing subject for Americans", Coe said, explaining why he and his wife wanted to write about it.
Equally distressing was the new, low-cost diet: Mystery dishes such as muffins and boxes became staple foods, and the box was 'a great way to use food sources', Ziegelman said, because cooks could hide less attractive ingredients under a layer of creamy sauce.
Fresh fruit was replaced by cheaper dried fruit.
Meat, which had been the centerpiece of American dining for years, was now a frugal, high-end product.
Different combinations were tried, with the emphasis on calories and nutrients over taste or even common sense in the kitchen.
While researching for a book of recipes, Ziegelman prepared a contemporary recipe that included boiled onions with peanut butter.
"It was not a popular addition to the dinner table", Coe said.
Ziegelman said, "It was unreal".
Peanut butter is definitely not a good fit for baked onions.
This was typical of many household recipes.
Household experts, such as Louise Stanley, director of the Federal Household Agency from 1923 to 1943, influenced the country's diet more than ever before or since.
By publishing recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines, they encouraged women to become 'budgeters' and to take up the challenge of turning such tasty foods as spaghetti and carrots into tasty dishes.
A Square Meal is a celebration of historical gourmet cuisine.
Especially delightful are the accounts of government responses to hungry citizens, such as President Herbert Hoover's "Let me eat cake" attitude.
At the same time that he publicly extolled the simple, farm-raised Iowa food of his childhood, he dined like the sophisticated millionaire he had become.
"He liked continental food, like fish with sauerkraut", Coe said.
He was in the nearly gilded dining room eating a tuxedo.
He was great at everything.
President Roosevelt might have made the same mistake if his wife, Eleanor, hadn't encouraged him to be an example with his own stomach.
As the book tells us, when Mrs. Roosevelt hired a housekeeper who had no interest in taste, the White House became a place that "not only served the most unpleasant but also the most unhealthy food in Washington".
Many of the Lamanite dietary practices were abandoned as soon as the land got back on its feet.
The legacy is our continued focus on calories and nutrition, Ziegelman said, and the way we apply science to cooking.
The couple said that writing the book gave them a better understanding of Ziegelman's mother's eating habits, including her inability to throw away food.
"He was really afraid of wasting food", Coe said.
Ziegelman recalled, "He even made people sick".
There was a wind-up.
After the plates were empty at Eisenberg, he and Coe brought out the dessert they had made at home: the plum dessert that President Roosevelt ate for lunch.
"It's called 'prune wax,'" Ziegelman said, adding that the common trick was to give modest recipes a fancy name.
The dessert was no cream, just plums, a little flour, sugar, water and cinnamon.
Everyone was reluctant to dip their spoons into their sticky brown trowel.
And then, all of a sudden, it wasn't so bad.
Coe was a little bit of a jerk.
Sounding like a positive budget-maker, he told his wife: 'A few chopped walnuts could help.'
Gilead will be awarded attorney's fees in the Hepatitis C patent battle against Merck.
A U.S. District Court judge has ruled that Gilead Sciences Inc. is entitled to recover attorney's fees incurred in a Hepatitis C patient case against the pharmaceutical company Merck & Co Inc.
In June, Gilead was released from $200 million in charges for violating two Merck patents related to Gilead's breakthrough drugs Sovaldi and Harvoni, following a U.S. judge's finding of Merck's malpractices, including false testimony and other unethical practices.
In a decision handed down Thursday, U.S. Circuit Judge Beth Labson Freeman said that Gilead is entitled to relief from damages incurred by the suit.
Merck is trying to catch up with Gilead, which is dominating the market with a new generation of hepatitis C drugs that can clearly cure more than 90 percent of patients with this liver disease.
The legal case dates back to 2013, when Gilead and Merck sued each other for ownership of the laboratory work underlying the active ingredient sofosbuvir in Gilead's medicines.
US-backed forces say they have captured the entire Isis-controlled Manbij
US-backed forces have completely captured the northern town of Manbij, near the Turkish border, after the last remaining Isis fighters left the town, the group's spokesman said Friday.
The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) are now searching the city after the last group of fighters who had been hiding in the city left.
The forces had freed more than 2,000 civilian prisoners held by the militants, Sharfan Darwish of the SDF's ally, the Manbij Military Council, told Reuters.
"We have the city under our control, but we are investigating it", he told Reuters.
The Clintons made $10.75 million in 2015, paid 34.2% of their federal taxes.
On Friday, Hillary Clinton released her 2015 tax returns, which showed that the Democratic presidential candidate and her spouse's income for that year was $10.75 million, and that their actual federal tax rate was 34.2 percent.
In 2015, the Clintons donated $1 million to charities, mostly the Clinton Foundation, former President Bill Clinton earned nearly $5.3 million in speaking fees, and a former Secretary of State announced that he received $3 million in donations from Simon & Schuster for his book on his career at the State Department.
Clinton's vice presidential candidate, Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia, with his wife Anne Holton, released 10 years of tax returns.
Their effective federal tax rate in 2015 was 20.3 percent.
"Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine are setting the benchmark for financial transparency", Clinton campaign aide Jennifer Palmieri said in a statement.
In stark contrast, Donald Trump is hiding behind false excuses and backtracking on his earlier promises to release his tax returns.
It is customary for US presidential candidates to release their tax returns, even though they are not required to do so by law.
New York businessman Trump and his lawyers have filed a lawsuit against the IRS for failing to release tax returns.
"Your turn", Clinton campaign aide Ian Sams said on Twitter as he posted a link to the Democratic candidate's tax returns.
On Thursday, Trump's special assistant, Michael Cohen, told CNN that he would not allow Trump to release the documents until the audit is complete.
Critics of Trump, including 2012 Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney and other Republican colleagues, have said that his refusal raises questions about his capital, his donations to charity, his business dealings, and numerous other ties to Russia, for example.
Clinton has taken to the problem of posting online video on Friday highlighting prominent Republicans urging Trump to release his taxes.
On Thursday, he raised the issue in his economic speech in Michigan.
"He refuses to do what every presidential candidate has done in the last decades: release his tax returns", he told the audience.
Politico has reported that Trump paid no or very little in taxes for two years in the 1990s, and a New York Times business columnist on Friday quoted numerous tax lawyers and accountants as saying that may still be the case.
Federal tax rates have become a problem in the presidential election.
Clinton has supported a rule named by billionaire investor Warren Buffett that would ensure that those earning more than $1 million a year pay at least 30 percent in taxes.
President Barack Obama also supports the proposal.
At the Clinton summit in Omaha, Nebraska last week, Buffett, whose Berkshire Hathaway conglomerate is based there, challenged Trump to meet and exchange tax returns.
Buffett said that he too has an audit of the tax administration underway, and that Trump is not "afraid" of the IRS, but of the voters.
The Clinton campaign has been releasing tax returns going back to 2007.
The Clintons, who now live in Chappaqua, New York, had an effective federal tax rate of approximately 32 percent between 2007 and 2014, and their effective combined tax rate was approximately 40.5 percent.
Clinton's 2015 tax returns showed that only $100 of their income came from wages, unlike most Americans.
Their primary investment target was a low-cost, index-linked mutual fund, and Clinton reported $109,000 in dividend and interest income.

Chili condoms and matching matches boost Tanzania's elephant protection
Conservationists in Tanzania are using an unusual method to prevent elephants from roaming human settlements - they are throwing condoms filled with chili powder at the animals.
The method has proven effective, and the Honeyguide Foundation, which conceived the idea several years ago in conjunction with the Nature Conservancy of the United States, has been intensifying its promotion by training volunteers in villages in northern Tanzania to use the non-violent four-step method to protect homes and crops without harming animals.
In the past, many people used spears to protect themselves.
Friday is World Elephant Day, dedicated to the conservation of these animals.
"Since we developed the tools, we have seen a change in attitude in these communities, where they are now much more confident that they can keep elephants out of their fields without harming them", said Damian Bell, Honeyguide's chief executive, in a statement.
The first two steps involve pointing at the intruding elephant with a pocket lamp and blowing a horn.
If it doesn't stop the animal, we throw a so-called "chilli cloud".
The condom is filled with a mixture of chili powder and earth and a sparkler, and then the condom is closed so that only the sparkler is visible.
When the condom is ignited, it bursts, bursts, and spews chili powder into the air.
One sniff is usually enough to send an elephant in a different direction.
As a last resort, a trigger that fires a Roman candle into the air, the joy of the moment produces a loud, clear explosion.
RT News: Jewish filmmaker criticizes Berlin hotel for removing Israeli area code at Arab request
A French filmmaker of Jewish origin has been caught off guard by a media storm after revealing that the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin does not list an Israeli directory number, a claim made by an employee who says this is due to "requests" from Arab customers.
Claude Lanzmann, the author of the Holocaust documentary Shoah, took out his frustration by writing an open letter to the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin for the German FAZ.
During his recent stay, Lanzmann tried to find the addresses of the Israeli hotel in the country directory.
However, the country was not listed among the countries that can be reached directly from a hotel room.
How is it possible that in 2016, in Berlin, the new capital of Germany, Israel has been removed and wiped out?
Lanzmann wrote it.
Kempinski Bristol, on the other hand, offers the possibility of calling Israel through its own call centre.
In search of an explanation, the filmmaker brought up the subject in the hotel lobby.
Lanzmann wrote that the answer he received "shocked" him.
The hotel receptionist said it was a "considered decision by the management of the Kempinski hotels".
The reason behind the decision caused the filmmaker even more consternation.
"Most of our guests are Arabs, and they demanded the removal of the Israeli area code", an employee reportedly told Lanzmann.
German Ambassador to Israel Yakov Hadas-Handelsman calls the case "a great injustice", the Zuddeutsche Zeitung has reported.
We were shocked and appalled by the incident.
That is a great injustice in itself.
But it is a greater shame that this is what happened in Germany and in this hotel business.
This doesn't need any explanation.
"We're waiting for the hotel to make the right conclusions", the official said.
The incident generated quite a backlash online, with people calling it a scandal.
Some argued that the Kempinski Hotel simply 'gave in' to the alleged demands of its Arab customers.
"Laugh", said another publication, noting that the hotel on the magnificent Kurfurstendamm Street stands near the synagogue.
The hotel itself quickly denied all accusations, calling the incident "ignorance" and "apologizing" to Lanzmann, Der Spiegel reported.
"A direct order not to include Israel in the shortlist was never issued", Kempinski's representative is quoted as saying by the Suddeutche Zeitung.
It adds that the direction number has now been added.
Police used tear gas and rubber bullets against Brazilian students who were demonstrating
Students clashed with police in the Brazilian city of São Paulo on Thursday as students gathered to protest against government reforms to the public education system.
Police used tear gas and rubber bullets against protesters.
The trouble began when law enforcement tried to break up the student mob, leading to the use of rubber bullets and tear gas.
Several hundred students joined the demonstration to express their horror at the plans.
Sao Paulo State Governor Paulo Geraldo Alckmin proposed that just under 100 public schools be closed and 300,000 students be relocated to save money.
Some of the protesters were seen writing graffiti against interim President Michel Temer on the wall.
This latest demonstration came just days after protesters rallied in support of the impeachment of ousted President Dilma Rousseff by the country's Senate.
RT Business: Trade between Russia and Iran grows abruptly 71%
Since the lifting of sanctions, trade between Moscow and Tehran has increased by 70.9 percent compared to the previous year, according to Russia's ambassador to Iran, Levan Dzhagaryan.
Since the lifting of international sanctions against Iran, Russian companies have shown interest in doing business in the country in large numbers, the ambassador said.
Russian companies continue to have existing ties with Iran, while new companies are ready to enter the market.
Of course, one of the main objectives of Iran's bilateral cooperation is to expand trade, said Dzhagaryan.
He noted that in the first five months of 2016, the trade turnover between Russia and Iran increased by 70,9% compared to the same period of 2015, amounting to USD 856 million.
In particular, Russian exports to Iran rose by 91.5 percent to a total of $697 million.
Russian imports from Iran rose 16 percent to $158 million.
The growth of trade was achieved through the delivery of machinery, vehicles and weapons, the Ambassador said.
In addition, Dzhagaryan expects a record number of Iranian tourists to Russia this year.
Last year, the Russian Foreign Ministry in Iran issued some 35 000 visas to Iranian citizens, mainly for travel purposes.
Iran also made the top 20 most visited countries in Russia for the first time.
'It is safe to say that the record number of Iranian tourists in Russia last year will be broken', he said.
At that time, very few Russians visit Iran, and the ambassador hopes that will change.
I can personally recommend visiting the cities of Isfahan, Shiraz and Yazd, which have preserved monuments of ancient Persian civilization in good condition, he said.
Skottium Callum Skinner jumped into the end zone as the British grabbed the bicycle pole.
Callum Skinner of Scotland claimed the men's team sprint at Rio's Cycling Stadium last night as the Great Britain team defended their 2012 London championship.
The 23-year-old from Glasgow was the anchor in the role, with his Scottish colleague Sir Chris Roy emerging as the legendary youngster's pride as he scored the winning try against the New Zealand team.
Britain took the shock victory four years ago, while Hoy won the fifth of his six Olympic gold medals.
And they repeated the feat after modestly finishing sixth in the World Endurance Championship in London in March, although Hoy has since retired from racing.
The problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the special envoy, Jamie Staff.
This was accomplished just in time for Hindes to appear.
Hoyn's termination also created a void that Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton were trying to fill.
Skinner was a man that British coaches held in high regard in Scotland for his potential, which is now realized.
Hindes, Kenny - who won the world championship with Hoy four years ago - and Skinner set an Olympic record in the time trial, but New Zealand took the lead in the first round.
And the British trio won the double gold.
Hindes was a little behind after his own lap, but Kenny pushed the team into the lead, and Skinner held on to it.
The strategy change was a big part of the makeover, and it involved Hindes driving in a bigger gear to slow down and allow Kenny and especially Skinner to catch up.
Hoy followed his position as an expert for the BBC, and caught the attention of Skinner, Kenny and Hindes as they stepped onto the podium.
Skinner, a 23-year-old from Glasgow, said: "I'm flattered by the environment".
I'm just here to do my best and get a reputation.
We set an Olympic record in the final and won the world championship.
It was absolutely incredible.
There's no better way to win.
After winning the 2012 London Olympics alongside Kenny and Hoey, Hindes admitted that he had deliberately crashed on the track after a poor start.
He later retracted his comments and no complaints have been made by British rivals.
This time, the overwhelming victory was not without its problems.
Hindes said: "It felt like being in London, with so many British flags on the pedestal".
As a team, we've made a connection in the last three months.
We've lost so many world championships, so to win the Olympics again is simply amazing.
One event, one gold medal for the nation that won seven out of ten cycling events in both Beijing and London.
If this is the pattern of the last five months, we're looking at a successful five days at the cycling stadium.
From the fitness Kenny has shown, it's not at all impossible to imagine him repeating Hoy's feat of winning three gold medals in a single Olympics.
This would mean that Kenny - who is exactly 12 years younger than Hoy, who was also born on 23 March (that apparently holy day in British sport, which is also the birthday of Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister) - would have a total of six gold and one silver medals.
It's the same as Hoyle.
Kenny will be competing in the next sprint, which starts today and lasts three days.
The 28-year-old from Bolton said: "I'm just enjoying this one now.
Team competition is always the best.
You're gonna win it with your friends.
Winning alone is lonely, to be honest.
Hindes said, "If he wins two more gold medals, he should be knighted".
This was the only medal round of the day, but there was more good news for Britain.
Sir Bradley Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull were the fastest in the four-man, four-kilometer team pursuit in the time trial.
Their time was 3:51:943.
The world record for winning gold in London 2012 is 3:51:659.
The first round and the final (22.42) will be held today, the second day of competition, with Wiggins sure to be the center of attention.
He had a dispute with the judges yesterday before the time limits when the officials called him to the longitude.
In the women's competition, which continues and ends tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Milngavien Katie Archibald set the world record when the clock stopped at 4:13:260.
The Great Britain team has learned to trust that its mighty cycling team will take over the Olympic centre and achieve the full medal tally.
After the truly exceptional and perfect management in Beijing and London, expectations have been lowered ahead of the Rio Games.
There has been drama, not the least of which has been the resignation of technical director Shane Sutton in April over allegations of sexism and bullying, and the demise of big names like Hoy and Victoria Pendleton.
But, based on the first night of competition at the Cycling Stadium, it seems that the now legendary reputation of Great Britain could be right again, rising to its peak at the perfect moment.
The future of Portland's smelter is in question because of the power contract cut.
The future of the Portland Victoria aluminum smelter, and the jobs of hundreds of workers, is in doubt after the utility that distributes the power to the plant revealed that one of the plant owners is terminating the distribution contract, so we expect a termination of all distribution contracts.
The measure follows a decision earlier this year by the Victorian government not to extend the subsidies required to keep the plant running.
The 20-year fixed-term grant expires in November.
Up to 2,000 jobs could be at risk at the Alcoa plant in Portland.
As many as 2000 jobs may be at risk, directly or indirectly, as a result of the plant closure.
In addition, a snowball effect may be possible, since melting consumes about 10% of Victoria's total electricity production.
In 2014, Alcoa closed the Point Henry smelter, which led to the closure of the Anglesea power plant last year.
Alcoan Portland's meltdown is losing money and is under a shutdown.
The measure follows several years of speculation about the future of the plant, which started as a result of the strong Australian dollar and has recently been driven by the price of the plant's output.
AGL, which distributes electricity to the large aluminum lathe at its Loy Yang An power plant in the Latrobe Valley, said it was also waiting for the other three owners to terminate their contracts.
The Alcoa and Alumina group owns the majority of the plant, with smaller shares held by China's CITIC and Japan's Marubeni Corp.
'AGL expects the Portland plant to continue to operate, which means that the physical electricity demand of the smelter will continue to rise', it said.
The AGL considers that the agreements are so-called 'protection agreements' which were to enter into force in November 2016.
The contracts have a notice period of 12 months, so they will effectively end in 2017.
Therefore, AGL expects the contracts to be profitable in the financial year 2017, the utility said.
The Commission considers that the market price of the electricity is the price of electricity in the Union market, which is the price at which the electricity is sold to customers in the Union.
AGL said that it had already reduced the value of the contracts in its books by $187 million in anticipation of the decision.
Alcoa said that the decision to terminate the contracts would not affect Alcoa's ability to keep the smelter running or to secure the smelter's electricity supply.
The US company said that it signed a 20-year contract with Loy Yang in 2010 and that the contract was to take effect in November this year, but it has not yet explained why it withdrew from the contract.
Analysts have been on the alert for both the Portland smelter in Victoria and the Tomagon plant near Newcastle, which is due to close because of the industry's poor financial situation.
Earlier this week, AGL's chief operating officer, Stephen Mikkelsen, told analysts that Portland uses about 600 megawatts of electricity a year, and Tomago about 900 megawatts.
If both plants leave the market, there will be a significant reduction in demand on the [electricity] market.
For us as electricity producers, this would not be a good thing, he said.
Kendall, not just a reality TV star from the Kardashians, is on the cover of September's Vogue.
Kendall Jenner, 20, model and the fourth daughter of mom-manager Kris Kardashian-Jenner's clan, is on the cover of American Vogue's coveted September issue.
Kendall, who is a brand ambassador for Estee Lauder and has modeled for fashion weeks in Milan, Paris and New York, announced the news on Thursday on her Instagram account.
"Watching this cover in a room full of loved ones made me cry", Kendall wrote.
The publicity stunt was followed by a unique (or perhaps just Kardashian-esque?) scripted reality video in which the entire Kardashian-Jenn family (excluding the troubled Rob and Caitlyn, and joined by everyone's favorite entertainer, Keeping Up producer Ryan Seacrest) forgot about her sister's cover, but ended in a classic twist: they were planning a surprise party.
It's the clichéd plot of almost every "birthday episode" of children's television (Seacrest says the lines "you must have thought we'd forget you with the credibility of a displaced puppy"), but Kris had to get her other girls to benefit from this publicity somehow.
This is because we've certainly moved into a new era of Kardashians with the September Vogue spot.
Kendall's older sister Kim may have graced the cover of Vogue first (she shared it with her husband Kanye West in April 2014), but the September issue is in a class of its own.
The September issue of Vogue is the best-selling issue of the year.
Its thickness is more like a coffee-table booklet than a fashion magazine, and the issue attracts a huge number of advertisers (Fashion magazine reported that last year's 832-page booklet contained 615 advertisements).
The cover is so eagerly awaited that for the past two years, images of the magazine have been leaked before the official release.
Previously, she has appeared on the cover of magazines such as Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista, and Kate Moss.
In recent years, there have indeed been more 'stars who act as models' than 'models who are celebrities'.
Oscar winner and Dior ambassador Jennifer Lawrence was on the cover in 2013, the year after Lady Gaga's cover of the year.
But if Jenner, who the magazine describes as the "success model" of her generation, should fall into the first category, she's in pretty good company.
These celebrities are not relatives of famous people or reality stars or the youth of today who know how to make a good Snapchat video (although Jenner is all of these things).
They are, quite rightly, talented women who are making it in the entertainment industry.
Last year's cover model Beyonce has had one of the strongest years of her career since the release of Lemonade.
Of course, not everyone is happy with Jenner's success.
With the history of reality TV, Jenner's place in the fashion world will always be her undoing.
In June, original Victoria's Secret model Stephanie Seymour criticized Jenner and her co-star Gigi Hadid, calling them "the bitches of the moment".
This feeling came back to me with Jenner's Vogue cover.
But to dwell on discontent is irrelevant.
Kendall Jenner is on the cover of the September issue of Vogue.
She's a supermodel in the purest sense of the word.
He's modeling for Marc Jacobs. He's got a lot of money.
She's selling you some Estee Lauder makeup.
She and all her sisters are selling you pictures of themselves on their own apps, behind the paywall.
He's selling pictures of Cindy Crawford's daughter that he took for LOVE magazine.
And in his spare time, possibly just to see his sister Kourtney and her kids, he's a reality TV star.
Community legal centers turn away 160,000 people a year.
Over 160,000 of the most vulnerable people are being turned away from Community legal centres each year as the sector prepares for the effects of further cuts in funding for its already fringe activities.
In Queensland, three out of five people - mainly the elderly, immigrants, vulnerable workers, victims of violence, those who have no opportunity to fight unfair evictions and the like - are turned away even as they seek free legal advice and representation.
The already stretched-out legal services of the community are preparing for further cuts.
By June of next year, these legal centers are set to lose 30 percent of their federal funding.
James Farrell, director of the Queensland Community Legal Centres, said that according to the latest National Association of Community Legal Centres census report, thousands are now being turned away annually.
Farrell said if the federal government's decision is not reversed, the situation will only get worse.
'The Queensland community legal centres are chronically underfunded, meaning that thousands of people are turned away from essential services every year,' he said.
People who are leaving abusive relationships, with uncontrollable and crippling debts, with broken families, with workers who have been unfairly fired - all of these people have legal problems, and this report shows that they are not getting the help they need.
The federal government is cutting funding by 30 percent in June 2017, which means that thousands of vulnerable Queenslanders are forced to navigate complex legal issues without help.
We appeal to the Minister of Justice and to Senator George Brandis of Queensland to immediately reverse these cuts in funding so that people can get the help they need for their legal problems.
Last year the State Government fulfilled its promise to raise the funding of legal aid to the national average.
It is time to look at the needs of the Community legal centre and its client societies, and the Palaszczuk government must invest in this important work.
The Donald Trump campaign has been sued after an employee was allegedly threatened with a gun.
New York: Donald Trump's campaign was sued for allegedly doing nothing after being told that the campaign's North Carolina operations manager threatened to shoot an employee in February while they were driving in a Jeep.
The incident was described in a lawsuit filed Wednesday in Charlotte County District Court by Vincent Bordini, a former software engineer for the state's campaign.
Bordini said he waited months for the situation to be handled internally before realizing that "it wasn't going to happen".
"Captain Earl Phillip pulled out his pistol, "put his right forefinger on the trigger, "and pushed the pipe against Vincent's kneecap, " Bordini said in the complaint.
After complaining to the local and regional campaign management, Bordini heard that at least four other people had had a similar experience with Phillip, the lawsuit said.
"You don't have to fire a weapon to cause harm", Bordini said in the lawsuit.
The challenge comes just two days after the Republican presidential nominee caused outrage by telling an audience in North Carolina that the people of the Second Amendment - which generally means gun owners and gun enthusiasts - could take action if her rival Hillary Clinton was elected and allowed to choose judges.
The Trump campaign said that the media had taken his words out of context and that he was not advocating violence.
Bordin's suit is seeking damages from the campaign for negligent surveillance and from Phillip for violence, assault and emotional distress.
Trump spokesman Hope Hicks did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Attempts to reach Phillip have been unsuccessful.
WCCB, the local news outlet in Charlotte, reports that Phillip recently left the campaign.
A call to his consulting firm, Innovative Consulting Services, was not immediately answered.
The campaign of the Republican candidate for President Donald Trump has been controversial.
The case is Bordini v. Donald J. Trump for President Inc., 16-CS-14300, General Court of Justice, Superior Court Division Country of Mecklenburg (Charlotte).
Britain must channel the spirit of the Olympics and expand Heathrow.
Heathrow brings revival and prosperity to the whole country, not just to local communities and parts of London.
For me personally, this was the great attraction of Heathrow, just as it was the great attraction of the London 2012 Games, where we went to great lengths to ensure that all our people and regions benefited from the Games.
The Olympics brought enormous benefits to Stratford and the East End.
And we're doing it again by creating opportunities for local people and businesses in the vicinity of Heathrow.
The aim is to create 10,000 new apprenticeships and 40,000 new jobs in local communities alone, and to eliminate youth unemployment around the airport.
As in the run-up to the London 2012 Games, some people will think that the challenge of expanding Heathrow is too great.
I was told that Britain would never be ready for the Games and that we would be shamed before the world.
The suspects were wrong in 2012, and they will be wrong about Heathrow.
There are always obstacles to overcome, but Heathrow is answering every question put to it.
Like the Olympics, Heathrow is an infrastructure project for many, not just a few.
The expansion has the potential to create up to 180 000 new jobs and £211 billion of economic growth, and to leave a legacy of skills and employment both around the airport and across the UK.
We have a great team at Heathrow, who have delivered an £11 billion infrastructure investment programme on time and on budget: from T5, which has been voted the world's best airport terminal for five years in a row, to T2, which was built between two of the world's busiest runways.
Now the team is ready to build the third runway, backed by £16 billion of private money.
The London 2012 Olympics were a great success for Great Britain, and I am convinced that the extension of Heathrow will be a great success too.
It is time for us to channel the Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow, secure the future of our trade and create a legacy of skills and employment that Britain can be proud of.
Lord Paul Deighton is the Chairman of the Heathrow Board and former Secretary of State for Trade.
Adblock Plus and the blocking of ads in the Facebook game Cat and Mouse
"For companies that make money from online advertising, companies that bypass ad-blocking programs are 'a game of cat and mouse,'" said one of the companies making such programs.
On Thursday, just two days after Facebook announced that it would block ad blockers on its desktop pages, Adblock Plus published a blog post saying that users can update the program's filters to block ads on the social network's pages again.
On Tuesday, Facebook said it's changing the code on its website around ads to make it harder for ad blockers to see which parts of the page are ads.
But now Adblock says it's bypassed the new code.
In a blog post, Adblock representative Ben Williams wrote that "this kind of back-and-forth battle between the open source ad blocking community and its detractors has been going on since ad blocking was invented" and that it is possible that Facebook will come up with its own solution soon.
The fact that the world's largest social media company has joined the fight is a strong indication of how much of a pest ad blockers have become to the industry.
According to a study by PageFair and Adobe last year, there are about 200 million people worldwide who use ad blockers, nearly four times the number who used them in 2013.
1.03 million daily active users are using Facebook on mobile devices, and mobile advertising now accounts for 84 percent of Facebook's advertising revenue.
The company is, however, after the ad blockers for desktop pages, as the mobile ad blockers do not work in Facebook's mobile apps for the social network or Instagram, the representative said.
The computer ads still generate enough revenue for Facebook to consider this kind of activity worth the investment.
Also on Tuesday, Facebook said it would update its "advertising preference" tool to give people more control over how ads are targeted to them.
On Thursday, Facebook said that Adblock's new filters were a concern because they would also block some of the site's non-ad content.
"This is not a good experience for people, and we are planning to address the problem", a Facebook spokesperson said in an emailed statement.
Ad blockers are boring tools, which is why we've instead focused on building tools like Ad Preferences that give people control.
A woman was run over by a car on a Swiss highway in an apparent suicide .
The victim was lying on the highway in the middle of the night.
Police are looking for witnesses after a woman was struck by several vehicles on a highway in the early hours of Thursday in what appears to be a suicide.
The incident took place on the A1 near Morges in the canton of Vaud just after midnight on Thursday.
The woman committed a "desperate act" and lay in the dark on the road, where she was struck by several vehicles, Vaud police said in a statement.
The victim, who clearly attempted suicide, was a 49-year-old Swiss woman who was struck by several vehicles, including a truck.
He died at the scene.
Several drivers involved in the incident have already been questioned, but not all have been identified yet, police said, appealing to them and all eyewitnesses to report.
A criminal investigation has been launched, which is a 'logical' step in a situation like this, lawyer Gilles Hofstetter told Le Tribune de Genève.
However, it remains to be seen whether any of the drivers involved will be prosecuted.
Was there any way to avoid a collision?
"That's for the prosecution to decide", Hofstetter said.
Two similar cases in the last five years suggest that drivers are not held accountable.
In both cases - both involving a person walking on a dark highway - it was estimated that motorists cannot expect to encounter a pedestrian on the highway in the middle of the night, the newspaper said.
Last year, the police were acquitted of charges of negligent homicide after he struck and killed a man lying on the A! road near Paynerne on a night in August 2014.
The 22-year-old victim had been drinking and had collapsed on the road, the court was told.
The court found that the police responding to an emergency call was driving in a reasonable manner and that the man's presence on the road was "a completely exceptional and unpredictable situation", the judge said.
Anyone with information about Thursday's incident near Morges should call the police on 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44.
NASA 's climate model: Venus was once inhabited by
According to new NASA climate model estimates, Venus was probably once inhabited.
Scientists at NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies developed a model to study the past of Venus using tools and algorithms similar to those used by climate scientists.
The model was designed to determine whether Venus, with its hot, water-deep surface and atmosphere filled with carbon dioxide, could have once had terrestrial conditions.
Scientists have previously suggested that the slow rotation of Venus is explained by its thick atmosphere.
But the latest simulation suggests that Venus could have had a thin, terrestrial atmosphere, and it could still have been rotating slowly.
The model also looked at the surface morphology of early Venus.
The planet probably had areas drier than Earth, but it once had enough water and geographical variety to support life and protect it from rapid water loss.
The advantage of early Venus was also that it had a 30% dimmer sun.
'In the GISS model simulation, Venus's slow rotation exposes its sun side to the sun for almost two months at a time,' explained GISS researcher Anthony Del Genio in a news release.
This heats the surface and produces rain, creating a thick layer of clouds that acts as an umbrella, protecting much of the surface from the sun's heat.
As a result, the average global temperature is actually a few degrees cooler than the present temperature of the earth.
The model produced a story about the evolution of Venus that is similar to what planetary scientists had previously assumed.
Although Venus was likely once inhabited, it was exposed to excessive heat and ultraviolet light over several billion years.
Its oceans evaporated and its water vapor burned in ultraviolet light.
When its hydrogen escaped, all that remained was a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide with deadly greenhouse gas emissions - Venus, as we know it today.
The scientists shared their findings on the new climate model of Venus in the journal Geophysical Research Letters.
Patrick Roy is giving up his coaching duties for the Avalanche .
Patrick Roy resigned Thursday from his position as Colorado Avalanche head coach and vice president of hockey operations, citing a lack of influence in the team's decision-making process.
Colorado vice president/general Joe Sakic confirmed the news, saying the team will begin searching for a new head coach immediately.
"For the past three years, I have served as vice president of hockey operations and head coach of the Colorado Avalanche with enthusiasm, passion and determination", said Roy, 50, in a statement.
I've been thinking long and hard over the summer about how I could improve this team to give it the depth it needs and take it to a higher level.
To achieve this, the vision of the coach and the vice-president of hockey affairs must be fully aligned with the vision of the organization.
He also needs to be able to influence decisions that affect the team's performance.
These conditions are not presently fulfilled.
Sakic, who hired Roy on May 23, 2013, thanked Roy for his contribution to the team.
"Patrick told me today about his decision", Sakic said.
We appreciate all that he has done for the organization, and we wish him well in the future.
Roy was named the Jack Adams Award winner for the league's top coach in his first season with the Avalanche in 2013-14.
He led the team to 112 points and a Central Division victory, but Minnesota knocked Colorado out in the first round of the playoffs, and the team hasn't made the playoffs in the last two years.
The 2015-16 Avalanche season ended with a record of 39 wins, 39 losses, and 4 ties, and the team lost by five points to the Wild, losing the wild card playoff spot in the Western Conference.
Hall of Fame goalie Roy won four Stanley Cups, two with the Montreal Canadiens and one with the Avalanche.
North Sea oil workers continue negotiations and postpone strike
North Sea oil workers' wage battles will be postponed as all the parties to the dispute sit down for a new round of negotiations, leading negotiators said.
Strikes against the oilfield services company Wood Group have been staged occasionally on North Sea rigs operated by Royal Dutch Shell.
"The Wood Group and the Unite and RMT associations can confirm that we have agreed to restart the process to seek a resolution of the current dispute", the joint statement read.
We will be holding several full-day meetings over the next few weeks, starting early next week, so that we can take a fresh look at the problems.
According to the unions, their recent labor strike action, which they say is the first in more than 25 years, was a protest against possible pay cuts of up to 30 percent.
This year, Wood Group cut the North Sea contractors' fees by about 9%, due to negative market pressures.
The Commission notes that the Commission has not found any evidence that the measures in question were necessary to achieve the objective of common interest.
The company said that the additional cuts would give the company the necessary flexibility to cope with the downturn in the market.
Shell, for its part, has cut thousands of people from its payroll and announced plans to exit oil and gas operations in as many as 10 countries as the company scales down its operations following its giant merger with British energy company BG Group.
Energy companies are under pressure from lower crude oil prices, and this economic situation is exacerbated by the UK's decision in June to leave the European Union.
Scottish MP Dave Anderson met with union leaders earlier this week to discuss one of the biggest labour disputes of a generation in the North Sea.
He said that the North Sea is essential to the economy of the region.
'We need an economy that works for the many, not just the few, in the North Sea as well as in the whole country', he said in a statement.
The North Sea is expected to see less than $1.4 billion in new project investment in 2016, compared to an average of about $7 billion over the previous five years.
Kepler is measuring the rotation of stars in the Pleiades Cluster
The latest mission of the Kepler space telescope has helped astronomers to compile the most complete catalog of the rotation speeds of the stars in the Pleiades.
The new data will help astronomers understand why the stars in the cluster rotate at different speeds and how the rotations are related to planet formation.
"We hope that by comparing our results with those of other star clusters, we will now learn more about the relationship between the mass of the star, its age and even the history of its solar system", Luisa Rebull, a researcher at the Caltech Pasadena Center for Infra-Red Processing and Analysis, said in a press release.
The Pleiades constellation is located 445 light-years from Earth.
Many of the stars in the cluster were born about 125 million years ago and are now reaching adulthood.
They're spinning at their peak now.
At their peak spin speed, these adult stars are spewing out large amounts of stellar wind.
When these winds pass through the magnetic fields of the stars, they brake the stars.
As a star ages, its rotation rate begins to slow.
Kepler measures the rate of rotation of each star by tracking the emergence of recognizable starbursts, such as sunspots.
A list of recent rotation rates of stars suggests that more massive stars rotate slower than less massive stars.
Rebull compares stars to dancers, of which the larger ones make the pirouettes slower than the smaller ones.
"In the Pleiades' 'ballet,' we see that the slowest rotors tend to be more massive, while the fastest rotors tend to be very light stars", Rebull said.
Because the Pleiades are so close, they're the ideal cosmic laboratory for evaluating the properties of stars at their rotational speeds.
"The Pleiadian star cluster provides an anchor for theoretical models of stellar rotation that encompass both the younger and older directions", Rebull said.
We still have much to learn about how, when and why stars slow down and, as it were, hang their "dancing" on their nails.
Rebull and his colleagues described the latest analysis of the Pleiadian spin rates in three papers soon to be published in the Astronomical Journal.
