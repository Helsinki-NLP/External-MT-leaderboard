This confirms the already established theory that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, and it also provides data that fossils normally cannot, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists say that the feathers of this animal were bony brown on the upper side and pastel or carotenoid colored on the lower side.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used for escape, but for temperature control or display. Although the tail is that of a young dinosaur, researchers believe that the pattern indicates that it is the feathers of an adult, not a pup.

France has always had a low-tech election: voters hide in individual booths and put a pre-printed sheet of paper with a marked choice in an envelope.
When the official person confirms the identity of the voter, he/she places this envelope in the voting box and signs the voter's name.

The candidates may send representatives to observe all parts of the procedure. In the evening, volunteers count the votes under strict supervision, following certain procedures.

The urine samples of pets who died from ingesting poisoned food found both cyanuric acid and melamine.
The compounds react with each other to form crystals that can interfere with the normal functioning of the kidneys, say university researchers.
Researchers found that when melamine and cyanuric acid were added to the cat's urine, crystals formed.
When compared with infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), the composition of these crystals matches that found in the urine of affected pets.

According to a study published Thursday in the journal Science, a new species of bird has appeared in the Galapagos Islands of Ecuador.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden have reported a new species that evolved by crossing the endemic Darwin's crayfish, Geospizo fortes, with the introduced cactus crayfish, Geospizo fortes, in just two generations, although they previously thought the process took much longer.
You can mold gold into many different shapes. You can roll it into tiny shapes.
It can be pulled into thin wire that can be twisted and plastered or it can be forged or rolled into sheets.
It can be flattened very thinly and attached to other metals. Because it can be flattened so thinly, it was sometimes used to decorate hand-drawn drawings in books called "illuminated manuscripts".
You can make a pH indicator with a little red cabbage juice.
The green juice changes colour depending on the acidity or alkalinity of the chemical.
The pH value of the test chemicals is determined by the amount of hydrogen (H in pH) ions.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have had their electrons removed (since hydrogen atoms are made up of one proton and one electron).

below are the more medium-sized cats who eat medium-sized prey, everything from rabbits to antelopes to deer.
There are also many small cats (including wild domestic cats) that feed on much larger prey, such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret to their success is the concept of a niche, a special job that a single cat has to do to protect it from competing with others.
The lion is the most sociable cat and lives in large groups called herds.
The herd is made up of one to three related males and up to 30 females and cubs.
As a large family of sisters and daughters, the women are usually closely related.
The lion pack behaves much like a pack of wolves or dogs, animals that are surprisingly lionlike in their behavior (but not the other big cats) and also very deadly to their prey.
Tiger is a good athlete and can climb (though not the best), swim, jump long distances and pull five times harder than a strong man.
Tiger belongs to the same group (genus Panthera) as lions, leopards, and jaguars.
The tiger's roar is not as full and uniform as the lion's, but more cut-out groans and screams.
The small animals are their food, and they hunt monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds when they can, and almost all the animals the small animals hunt are much smaller than the small animals.
Scientists think that the ozelote tracks and searches for food (gas) animals by smell, because they smell where they have been on the ground.
Night vision allows them to see very well at night and move around inaudibly, whereas the prey is first absorbed by the surroundings and then jumped on the prey.
When a small group of living organisms (a small population) moves away from the main population from which it came (for example, if it moves across a mountain range or a river or if it moves to a new island and it is difficult to return), it will often find itself in a different environment than it was before.
This new environment has different resources and competitors, and the new population will need different characteristics or adaptations to cope with them.
The original population has not changed at all, they still need the same adjustments as before.
As a new population starts to adapt to a new environment, it eventually becomes less and less like the other population.
Eventually, thousands or even millions of years from now, the populations will be so different in appearance that they cannot be considered the same species.
This process is called speciation, which means the creation of new species. Species is an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce oxygen, which humans breathe, and they take in carbon dioxide, which humans expel from the lungs (or exhale).

Though their food may seem familiar to most of us, the Romans had quite a few strange or unusual holiday dishes, including wild boar, peacock, lizard, and a type of rodent called pollock.
Another difference was that while poor men and women sat on chairs at lunch, rich men preferred to enjoy their meals together, lying on their sides during lunch.

The back of the Declaration of Independence had the words "The Original Declaration of Independence of July 4, 1776". The text is written at the bottom of the document, upside down.
Nobody knows for sure who wrote it, but we do know that a large document on parchment (measuring 29 3/4 inches by 24 1/2 inches) was stored in the form of a scroll early in its life.
It is therefore possible that the mark was simply added as a mark.
The D-Day landings and the battles that followed, liberated northern France, but the south was still unconquered.

The American and French Free Forces have liberated southern France in just two weeks and are heading towards Germany.
Civilizationis a unique culture, shared by a large group of individuals living and cooperating together, a society.

THE CULTURE OF CIVILIZATION involves the transmission of knowledge through generations, a lasting cultural heritage and a significant diffusion.
Smaller cultures often disappear without leaving a significant historical trace, and therefore cannot be considered true civilizations.

Japan has nearly 7,000 islands (Honshu is the largest), making it the seventh largest island in the world.

Taiwan dates back to the 15th century, when European sailors who sailed past the island called it Ilha Formosa, or Beautiful Island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company set up base in southwest Taiwan and began to transform the native ways of growing grain and employing Chinese laborers to work on rice and sugar plantations.

Machu Picchu consists of three main structures, namely Intihuatana, the Sun Tower, and the Shrine of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the edge of the complex have been rebuilt to make it easier for tourists to imagine what they originally looked like.

For example, the most widely used photographic format for still images in the world is 35 mm, which was the dominant film size at the end of the analog film era.
It is still used today, but more importantly, its image ratio has also taken on the image type formats of digital cameras.
actually  and somewhat unusually  measures 36 mm in width and 24 mm in height.
The ratio of this format (dividing by 12 to get the most basic ratio in the form of an integer) is 3:2.
Many common formats (ASP family of formats) are the same or very close to this ratio of height and width.
The rule of thirds, which is often exploited and often ridiculed, is a simple guide that creates dynamics and at the same time provides a criterion for image editing.
According to him, the most efficient place for the main object on the cross-section is the line that divides the image into thirds vertically and horizontally (see example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church came under scrutiny, enriching itself and expanding its power.
The Christian faith has united the nations of Europe for over a millennium despite differences in language and customs.
Her omnipresent power affected kings as well as common people.
One of the main doctrines of Christianity is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that the church's funds are intended for this very purpose.
The seat of central church authority has been in Rome for over a thousand years, and this concentration of power and money has led many to question whether it really follows this principle.

The crowd forced the king and queen to open the carriage windows on the sidewalk.
At one point, someone in the crowd waved the head of a member of the royal guard who had been killed in Versailles to the frightened queen.
The war expenses of US imperialism during the conquest of the Philippines were paid by the Filipino people alone.
They had to pay taxes to the US colonial regime to cover most of the costs and interest on bonds issued on behalf of the Philippine government through Wall Street banking houses.

To understand the Templars, you have to understand the context in which they created the Order.
The period in which these events took place is commonly known as the High Middle Ages, which refers to the period of European history in the 11th, 12th and 13th centuries (10001300 AD).

TECHNOLOGICAL DETERMINISM is a term that encompasses a wide range of ideas and practices, from technological endeavor or technological necessity to the idea that human destiny is driven by fundamental logic, related to scientific laws and their application in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share the same general idea: that the development of technology itself follows a path strongly influenced by culture and politics, and that technology consequently causes "effects" on societies that are inherent rather than socially conditioned.
You might say, for example, that with the development of the automobile, the road will certainly develop.
The national road network cannot be economically justified for a few cars, so new manufacturing methods are being developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
Car ownership also leads to an increase in road accidents, leading to the invention of new medical techniques for treating injured bodies.
Cultural determinism, which he drew from writers such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel, was an important element of Romanticism.
In the case of romance, individuals were shaped by geographical affiliation, and over time, customs and cultures associated with a particular geographical area emerged that were compatible with the state of society and thus superior to arbitrary laws.

The city's reputation as a center of luxury began around 400 C.E. and lasted until 1100 C.E.
The status of the Byzantine emperor fell somewhat in the 12th century as the crusaders returned home with gifts of silk and spices, worth more than the Byzantine market offered.
at the time, the name of the fashion capital shifted from Constantinople to Paris.
Gothic reached its peak in the 10th-11th century and in the 14th century.

Because of the slow pace of communication, Western styles could be 25 to 30 years behind.
n the late Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style, and one of the greatest advances of the time, and the result of the Crusades, was the use of buttons to fasten clothes.
self-sufficient farming is a term used for farming with the aim of producing sufficient quantities of food to meet the needs of the farmer and his family.
self-sustaining farming is a simple, often organic system, whereby stored seeds originating in the same ecological region are used in combination with rotation or other simple techniques to ensure the best possible harvest.
In the past, most farmers were self-sufficient farmers, and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Subculture brings together like-minded individuals who feel they have been overlooked by social norms, and allows them to develop their own identity.
Subcultures may differ in terms of age, ethnicity, class, location and/or gender of its members.
The characteristics that make a subculture distinctive can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or a combination of factors.
Subculture members often show their belonging by using a recognisable and symbolic style, which includes fashion, behaviour and argot.
One of the most common ways to illustrate the importance of socialization is to draw on a few unfortunate cases of children who were not socialized by adults during their childhood because of neglect, unfortunate circumstances or intentional abuse.
Some wolf children have been imprisoned by humans (usually their parents); this form of child abuse has in some cases resulted from the parents' denial of the child's more severe mental or physical disability.
Before being abandoned or fled, wild children may have been subjected to severe abuse or trauma in childhood.
Others are said to have raised animals; some are said to have lived in the wild themselves.
When wild children are completely raised by nonhuman animals, their behavior (within physical limitations) is almost exactly the same as the behavior of the animal keepers, for example, fear or indifference towards humans.
project-based learning should be easier and more interesting, but it goes a step further.
THE COURT is not a learning method, but rather a support tool for individuals learning something new, such as how to use a new computer program or start a new project.
stage can be both virtual and real, in other words, the teacher is a form of stage, but the same is true for a little bit of a loop in Microsoft Office.
Virtual stages are built into the software and are intended to ask questions, encourage and explain procedures that may be too challenging for the learner himself.
Children are placed in foster care for a variety of reasons, ranging from neglect to abuse and even blackmail.
No child should be raised in an environment that is not encouraging, loving and nurturing, and yet it is happening.
We think the foster care system is a safe haven for these kids.
Our parenting system should provide safe housing, loving caregivers, stable education and reliable health care.
The herd was supposed to provide all the necessities of life they didn't have in the home from which they had been taken earlier.
Internet combines both mass and interpersonal communication elements.
The unique characteristics of the Internet allow for new dimensions in terms of use and approach to reward.
andsocialization are thought to be important motivators for using the Internet (James et al., 1995).
Personal engagement andpermanent relationships were also identified as new aspects of motivation by Eighmey and McCord (1998), when they studied how the public responds to a website.
The video recordings have made important discoveries in the interpretation of micropotes, facial movements that last only a few milliseconds.
They say that by correctly interpreting microexpressions, it is possible to detect whether a person is lying.
Oliver Sacks, in his article The President's Speech, explained that people who cannot understand speech because of brain damage are nevertheless able to accurately assess honesty.
He even suggests that animals, such as domestic dogs, have the same ability to interpret human behavior.
20th century research shows that there are two sets of genetic variations: hidden and expressed.
mutation adds a new genetic variation, and selection removes it from the set of expressed variations.
The separation and recombination with each generation shift variations back and forth between the two sets.
Animalia with a digestive system similar to humans, with plant resources available in the savanna, have difficulty satisfying their amino acid needs.
Plus, if this need can't be met, there are serious consequences: stunting, malnutrition, and eventually death.
The easiest plant sources to access would be the proteins found in leaves and leaves, which are difficult for primates, including us, to digest unless cooked.
The food from animals (anth, termites, eggs) is not only easy to digest, but also a source of high-quality protein, which contains all the essential amino acids.

Sleep interruption is the process of intentionally waking up during normal sleep time and falling back to sleep soon (after 10 to 60 minutes).
You can do this with a relatively quiet alarm clock that will override you but not wake you up.
If you happen to reset your alarm clock in your sleep, you can set it on the other side of the room and force yourself to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other biorhythm-based options include drinking large amounts of fluids (especially water or tea, which is a known diuretic) before bedtime, forcing the person to get up and go to the water.
The amount of inner peace an individual has is inversely proportional to the amount of tension in the individual's body and spirit.
The lower the tension, the more positive the life force is. Each person has the potential to achieve absolute peace and contentment.
Enlightenment is something that anyone can achieve, and the only obstacle to that is our own tension and negativity.

Tibetan Buddhism is very simple in principle. consists of yoga kundalini, meditation and the path of unconditional love.
Kundalini yoga yoga poses yoga breathing exercises mantra and visualizations allows for the awakening of the kundalini energy (the energy of enlightenment)
The central Tibetan meditation is the Divine Yoga. Through the visualization of various deities, the energy channels are cleansed, the chakras are activated and enlightened consciousness is created.
Because Germany was a common enemy during WWII, the USSR and the USA began to cooperate. After the war, systemic, procedural and cultural differences led to a rift between the two nations.
Two years after the war ended, the former allies became enemies and the cold war began.
The next 40 years, they fought, with the help of proxy troops, in the battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, in Cuba, and in many other places.
September 17, 1939 Polish defenses were broken and the only hope was to retreat and relocate to the Romanian bridge.

The use of cargo ships is by far the most efficient way to move large numbers of people and goods across oceans.
The traditional role of the navy has been to ensure that the state maintains the ability to move people and goods, while limiting the enemy's ability to move his people and goods.
one of the most recent examples, the most notable being the north atlantic campaign of world war ii. to help the british, the americans tried to get men and materials across the atlantic ocean.

Ancient cultures and tribes began to cultivate them for easy access to milk, hair, meat and skin.
Goats were mostly kept in herds that roamed the hills or other pastures, and were often cared for by shepherds, often children or teenagers, similar to the more familiar shepherds of sheep. These methods of herd management are still used today.
In England, the railways were built as early as the 16th century.
Though the wagon tracks consisted only of parallel desks, they enabled the horses to pull them to reach higher speeds and to pull larger loads than on the slightly worse roads of the time.
Pretty soon, they started using thresholds to keep the tires in place, but gradually they found that the tires were more effective with a strip of iron on top.
This became a common practice, but iron made wooden wheels wear out faster.
The wooden wheels were eventually replaced by iron wheels, and in 1767 the first railways were introduced that were all iron.
walking was the first known form of transport, people started walking upright two million years ago, when Homo erectus appeared.
their ancestor the Australopithecus did not usually walk upright.

can join the environmental movement, we can even become activists to reduce suffering in the future to some extent.
This is similar to symptomatic treatment in many ways, but if we don't want to see a temporary solution, we need to find the root cause and fix it.

After it was passed by Congress on July 4, the handwritten draft, signed by President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson, was sent a few blocks away to John Dunlap's printing press.
They made between 150 and 200 copies overnight, known as Dunlap's Flyers.
The document was read publicly for the first time by John Nixon on July 8 in the courtyard of Independence Hall.
one was sent to George Washington on July 6 who read it to his troops in New York on July 9 a copy reached London on August 10

Today, many paleontologists believe that one group of dinosaurs survived and is still alive today.

Though, birds and dinosaurs share many similarities.
They have scales and claws on their feet, lay eggs, and walk on their back legs like tyrannosaurs.

A binary number can have only one of two values, i.e. 0 or 1, these two numbers are called binary digits  or bits, if we use computer jargon.
Poisoning internally is not always the most obvious. Signs such as vomiting are sufficiently common to make an immediate diagnosis.
The main sign of internal poisoning is the possible presence of open packaging containing medicinal products or toxic household chemicals.
Check the label to see if specific first aid instructions are given for this poison.
The term insect is officially used by entomologists for this group of insects.
The term comes from the prehistoric relationship with the finches, highly evolved human parasites.
Both raptors and finches are nesting animals adapted to live in the nest or home of their host.
In the United States, there are about 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), making it the leading neurological disease in younger and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which includes the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerves.
Studies show that women are twice as likely to develop MS as men.
A couple may decide that caring for a child is not in their best interests or in the best interests of their child.
These couples can choose a plan for their child.
In adoption, the biological parents relinquish their parental rights so that the role of the child's parents can be taken over by another couple.
The main goal of science is to find out how the world works, using the scientific method, which is actually the main goal of most scientific research.

Naturalists and philosophers have focused on the classical text, especially the Latin Bible.

As the knowledge of Greek declined, the Western world broke away from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Most of the observed rhythms in psychology and behavior are often substantially dependent on the presence of endogenous cycles and their formation by means of biological clocks.
Rhythms that are not just responses to periodic external stimuli have been observed in most living things, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that continue periods of continuous cyclical repetition even in the absence of external stimuli.
The Hershey and Chase experiment was one of the first hints that DNA is genetic material.
Hershey and Chase implanted their own DNA into the bacteria using phages, or viruses.
They did two experiments where they labelled the DNA in the bag with radioactive phosphorus or the protein in the bag with radioactive sulfur.
The effects of mutations can vary greatly, depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the affected part of the genetic material, and whether the target cells are affected.
Only mutations in call cells can be passed on to children, and elsewhere mutations can cause cell death or cancer.
Natural tourism attracts people who are interested in visiting natural areas to enjoy the beauty of the landscape, including its plants and wildlife.
The activities in the field include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching and park visits, and the study of ecosystem information.

In developed countries, you rarely hear similar complaints about water quality or the demolition of bridges.
Why are there so many complaints about transport systems, why do they fail every day? Is it the incompetence of the transport engineers? Or is it something more fundamental?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions they have with each other.
Unfortunately, studying traffic flow is difficult, because driver behaviour cannot be predicted with 100% certainty.
Fortunately, drivers' behaviour is usually fixed to some extent, so traffic flows are fixed and can be represented in mathematical form in a very general way.
The Commission notes that the Commission did not consider that the measures in question constituted State aid within the meaning of Article 107 (1) TFEU.
This relationship helps to plan, design and operate roads.
Barbones were the first animals to fly, and their ability to fly made them more adept at avoiding enemies and finding food and mating partners.
Most insects have this advantage: They can spread their wings along their body.
This gives them more opportunities to hide from predators.
Today, the only insects that can't fold their wings to the body are the snake shepherds and the unicorns.
1000 years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system revolves around the sun.

The Amazon River is the second longest and largest river on Earth, containing over eight times as much water as the second largest river.
The Amazon, which is up to six miles wide, is also the widest river on Earth.
20% of the water that flows from the rivers to the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The Amazon River is 6,387 kilometers (3,980 miles) long and is fed by thousands of smaller rivers.

Aristotelis, the philosopher, theorized that everything is made up of a mixture of four elements: earth, water, air and fire.
actually there were more than four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gaseous, and plasma, although he claimed that they transformed into new substances and made what we see.
Alloys are basically a mixture of two or more metals.Remember, there are many elements in the periodic table.

A fission bomb works by requiring energy to bind together a nucleus with lots of protons and neutrons.
Like pushing a heavy cart into a slaughterhouse, and then some of that energy is released by re-injecting the core.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, meaning that they usually decay either by themselves or almost without help.

Content theories are about finding what drives people forward or what pleases them.
Theories say that people have certain needs and/or desires that they internalize as they grow up.
Theories explore what makes some people want the things they want, and what things in the environment will make them do or not do certain things.
Two popular content theories are the hierarchy of needs according to Maslow and Herzberg's two-factor motivation theory.

Virtual groups aim for the same standards of excellence as conventional groups, but there are slight differences.
virtual group members often act as a contact point for their direct physical group.
They tend to have more freedom than the regular members of the group, as their groups have to adapt to more time zones, which their local leadership sometimes does not listen to.
Another characteristic component of a virtual group is the presence of a real invisible group (Larson and LaFasto, 1989: 109).
Invisible team is a management team to which individual members report.An invisible team sets standards for each member individually.
Why should an organisation undergo a delayed process of establishing a learning organisation?
When the working parts of the organisation make efficient use of the resources available, creativity and ingenuity can be initiated.
This can lead to a new innovative process in the process of intra-organisation cooperation to overcome barriers and meet the needs of customers.
Before a given organisation can become innovative, management must establish an innovative environment and encourage knowledge sharing and organisational learning.
Angel (2006) interprets the continuity approach as a method used to help organisations achieve higher levels of efficiency.
Neurobiological data provide physical evidence for a theoretical approach to cognition research, so it narrows down the research area and significantly increases its accuracy.
The link between brain pathology and behavior supports the thesis in scientific research.
It's been known for a long time that different types of brain damage, trauma, lesions, and tumors affect behavior and lead to changes in certain mental functions.
The advent of new technologies has allowed us to see and study structures and processes in the brain that we have never seen before.
This gives us a lot of information and material to build simulation models that help us understand how processes work in our heads.
Although AI has a strong science fiction appeal, it is a very important branch of computing that deals with the behavior, learning and intelligent adaptation of machines.
research in AI involves making machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behaviour.
examples include monitoring, scheduling and scheduling, ability to respond to client diagnoses and questions, and handwriting, voice and facial recognition.
these things have become separate industries focused on providing solutions to real-life problems.
AI is widely used in economics, medicine, engineering, and the military, as it is embedded in a wide range of PC and video game software.

Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century B.C. and was used as a strategic port by the Phoenicians, Romans, and Merenids, who called it Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it as Casa Branca, then abandoned it after the earthquake of 1755.
Casablanca was renovated by the Moroccan sultan as Daru l-Badya, and the name Casablanca was given to it by Spanish traders who established trading posts there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to shop in all of Morocco.
