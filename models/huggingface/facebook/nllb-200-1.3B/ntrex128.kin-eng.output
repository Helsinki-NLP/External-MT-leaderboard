Members of Parliament in Wales (AMs) are concerned about 'being like muppets'
There is concern that some MPs are suggesting that their nomination should be changed to Members of Parliament (MWPs).
The result was that there was a plan to change the name of the Parliament to the Parliament of the Peerage of Wales.
Members of the House in the political arena were concerned that this would lead to criticism.
A Labour councillor said the council was concerned that the slogan "sounds like Twp and Pwp".
For non-Gaelic readers: In Welsh twp means fool and pwp means fool.
A Plaid representative said the party as a whole was "not happy" and made other demands.
The representative of the Conservative Party in the Peyi de Gale said that the representative party was "open to different views" on the name change, but stressed that there is no significant difference between the term MWP (Member of Parliament) and Muppet (Muppets).
It is in this context that the Welsh letter w is pronounced like the letter u in Yorkshire English.
The House Committee, which is currently drafting a bill to change the name, stated: "The decision to withdraw the definition of what the House members will be called will be made by the House members themselves".
The 2017 Government of Gaul Act empowered the members of the Gaul Assembly to change its name.
In June, the Commission announced the results of a public consultation on proposals where a majority of the population supported the name of the Assembly as the Parliament of the Principality of Wales.
On the issue of the selection of MPs, the Commission gave a wide range of options for being named MPs of Wales or WMPs, but the choice of MWP was strongly supported in public consultation.
Board members seem to have offered alternatives, but agreement is hard to come by for the Chairperson, Elin Jones, who is expected to submit a draft amendment bill in the coming weeks.
The reform law contains further changes to the way the Board operates, including rules governing dismissal of Board members (AM) and the structure of the committee.
The members of the Assembly will vote definitively on the question of what they should be called when they consider the bill.
Macedonians go to referendum on changing the country's name
Voters will vote on Sunday on whether to change the country's name to "Republic of North Macedonia".
The referendum was held to settle a decades-old dispute over Greece's neighboring state, with its own province called Macedonia.
The Greek government in Athens has insisted that the name of its northern neighbor is identical to the name of its region and has consistently denied the country membership in the European Union and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, who did not vote in the referendum on renaming, said he would not vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, say the name change is the only price they will pay to join the European Union and NATO.
Bells on St. Martin's Church are not ringing as Harlem churches face problems
"According to the history", says Mr. Adams, "adults I spoke to said that there was a bar and a temple on every corner.
"Nothing today".
He said that the shortage of butterflies was understandable.
"People are interacting differently these days".
"The bar is no longer a chat room where people go permanently".
As for churches, he worries that the money from property sales will not last as long as officials expect, "and soon things will be back to normal".
He added: Churches can be replaced by apartments with many rooms filled with people of different races who will not help the church to remain holy.
"The majority of the residents who buy apartments in these buildings are white", "this will reduce the number of days the churches are closed because it is unlikely that these people who moved into the rooms will become members of the churches".
Churches built by the white congregation before Harlem became a predominantly black city - Urban Settlers in 1870, St. Martin's Church a decade later.
The white Methodist congregation moved in the 1930's.
The black congregation that worshiped nearby soon took the name of the temple.
The St. Martin's Day parade was attended by black congregants led by Reverend John Howard Johnson, who once protested against small business owners on 125th Street, Harlem's main shopping street, who refused to hire or promote blacks.
A fire in 1939 severely damaged the building, but when the parishioners under Pastor Johnson planned to rebuild, they sold the bells.
Archbishop David Johnson, the son of Rev. Johnson and the patron saint of St. Martin's, is proud to call the bell "the bell of the poor".
The expert who spoke at the meeting in July called it "cultural heritage" and "a historic monument that cannot be replaced".
The expert, Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan, also said it was the first bell in the world played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who played the grand bell at the Riverside Chapel 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather said that St. Martin never replaced him.
What happened at St. Martin's in the past few months was a complex story of architects and contractors, some brought in by the lay leaders of the church, others by the Episcopal Diocese.
Sacristy: The parish governing body, composed of lay leaders, wrote to the diocese in July expressing concern that the diocese was "looking for ways to pay" for the sacristy, although the sacristy has no involvement in hiring architects and contract signers sent by the diocese.
Some parishioners complained that there was no lightworking on the part of the diocese.
A 13-year-old boy injured by a carnivore at a California fishery for a sea slug
A 13-year-old boy was injured by a fishy fish on Saturday while diving for lobsters in California on the opening day of the lobster season, officials said.
The raid took place just before 7 a.m. near the Beacon beaches in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he was diving with friends for about 30 minutes on Saturday morning when he heard the boy scream for help and a group of people came to help him out of the water.
Hammel said that at first he thought it was the joyful sound of chasing lobsters, but later "he found it was a cry, 'I'm lost!
He hates me!'
What Hammel saw when he reached the boy: The whole bone of the sword was exposed,
Hammel continues: "I shouted to everyone to get out of the water: 'Here's the fish I'm eating!'
The boy was airlifted to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego where he is currently in critical condition.
The species of predatory fish that may have attacked is unknown.
At a press conference with the Marine Rescue Captain Larry Giles said that predatory fish had been spotted in the areas in the previous few weeks, but it was not identified as a problematic species.
Giles went on to say that the victim suffered severe injuries to the upper chest.
Authorities have banned access to beaches from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami's in Ecinitas for 48 hours for investigative and security reasons.
Giles estimates that there are more than 135 species of predatory fish in the area, but many are considered harmless.
Sainsbury's plans to enter the UK beauty market
Sainsbury's is approaching Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with a high-end retail chain and specialist customer service.
As part of a larger push into the UK's $2.8 billion beauty market, which continues to thrive as the retail and home appliance industries continue to decline, the largest beauty retailers will be piloting in 11 stores across the province and reaching more stores next year if they prove successful.
Investing in high-end appliances is like hunting down the way that the advanced markets use the space of the stage to install televisions, microphones and home appliances.
Sainsbury's said it could double its retail portfolio to 3,000 products, including major brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
Traditional brands from L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also have more space to accommodate the same major brands as in the marketplace like Boots.
The emerging market is also re-launching a cosmetics store to make most products more vegan-friendly, a growing demand among young consumers.
And, the fragrance shop's perfume dealer will be exploring our two Sainsbury's stores, the first of which opened in Croydon, south London, last week and the second will open in Selly Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
Online shopping and the shift to buying small amounts of food every day in local shops means that larger stores have to do more to attract shoppers.
Mike Coupe, CEO of Sainsbury's, said the stores will expand as convenience stores as larger stores try to compete with price-fixing intermediaries including Aldi and Lidl offering more convenience and non-food options.
Sainsbury's has added Argos stores to its hundreds of stores and has also opened Habitats stores as it acquired both stores in the past two years, which has increased food sales and generated higher profits.
A pilot project by a large cosmetics and pharmaceutical re-branding firm ended in failure.
Sainsbury's tried to merge with Boots in the early 2000s, but the merger ended in a bad deal and they split the proceeds from the pharmacy sales in their supermarkets.
The new measures come after Sainsbury's sold 281 pharmacies to Celesio, the owner of Lloyds Pharmacy, for Â£125 million three years ago.
Lloyds is said to have been involved in the scheme, adding other expensive body oils including La Roche-Posay and Vichy to the chain's four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, chief marketing officer at Sainsbury's, said: "We have changed the way things look and feel in the high-end department store to improve the experience of our customers.
We have also invited our specially trained colleagues who will be nearby to provide advice.
Our species are designed to be adaptable and attractive and to be a place where we are now a luxury resort that is changing the old way of living".
Peter Jones 'outraged' after Holly Willoughby withdrew from Â£11m deal
Dragons Den star Peter Jones is 'outraged' after TV presenter Holly Willoughby pulled out of an Â£11 million social enterprise deal to focus on her new deal with Marks and Spencer and ITV
Willoughby has no time for their home fashion and the famous music label Truly.
The business partnership between the two has been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's company Goop.
The 37-year-old This Morning reporter took to Instagram to announce her resignation.
Holly Willoughby left Dragons' Den star Peter Jones in a fit of rage after withdrawing from the business of a high-end luxury fashion company at the last minute to focus on her own lucrative deal with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources said Jones was "outraged" when a TV personality admitted in a major interview Tuesday at the headquarters of her business in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that her new contract is worth Â£1.5 million; meaning she has not had enough time to secure a position with the home-grown clothing company Truly.
The business is estimated to be similar to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop and is expected to double Willoughby's revenue by Â£11 million.
While Willoughby, 37, took to Instagram to announce his retirement from Truly, Jones took a flight from the UK to one of his holiday homes.
"Truly it is not close to what Holly had set out to achieve", the source said.
It was a long-term future that would take him decades.
His decision to leave came as a surprise to all onlookers.
No one would believe what happened on Tuesday, as it was just beginning.
There is a museum full of merchandise at Marlow HQ ready to sell".
Experts believe the departure of The Morning host, one of Britain's most well-known and profitable investors, could cost the company millions due to heavy investment in products ranging from pillows and candles to clothing and home furnishings and further delaying its launch.
And it may mean the end of a long-standing friendship.
Willoughby, who has three children with her husband Dan Baldwin, has been a close friend of Jones and his wife Tara Capp for ten years.
Willoughby co-founded Truly with Capp in 2016 and Jones, 52, joined as CEO in March.
The two families vacation together and Jones owns a 40 percent stake in Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby is expected to become the corporate ambassador for M&S and replace Ant McPartlin as host of ITV's I'm A Celebrity.
The following night, a source close to Jones said: "We cannot comment on his business activities".
A Difficult Conversation and 'Afterward Love'
He joked about the media criticism, commenting that some people view it as "not fit for president" and his strong sympathy for the North Korean leader.
Why did the President give so much?
Trump spoke in a critical tone of "reading the news".
"I never gave anything".
He said Kim was keen on a second summit after the previous summit in Singapore in June was hailed by Trump as a major step toward North Korea's abandonment of its nuclear weapons program.
But the talks on nuclear disarmament are slow.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea's top diplomat Ri Yong Ho told world leaders at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea did not see a "comprehensive response" from the United States to North Korea's early nuclear disarmament efforts.
Instead, he said the US is continuing sanctions aimed at maintaining pressure.
Trump made an optimistic statement in his campaign speech.
"North Korea is a good country", he said.
"We were going to war with North Korea.
Millions have died.
Now we are happily married".
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim had yielded positive results, halting missile tests, helping to free prisoners and allowing remaining American personnel to return home.
And he spoke about his unusual way of talking about his relationship with Kim.
"It's very easy to be president, but instead of having 10,000 people outside trying to get into this crowded room, we'd have about 200 people standing here", Trump said, pointing to the crowd in front of him.
Tsunamis and earthquakes in Indonesia devastated an island and killed hundreds
For example, after the Lombok earthquake, international NGOs were told that they were not needed.
Although more than 10 percent of Lombok's population has been displaced, no national outbreak has been reported, which is a prerequisite for international assistance.
"Unfortunately", says Mr. Sumbung, "it was largely clear that they would not seek international support, so it is difficult".
While Save the Children is looking for a team to travel to Palu, it is not clear whether foreign workers can work in the area.
Mr. Sutopo, spokesperson for the National Disaster Management Agency, said that Indonesian authorities were reviewing the situation in Palu to see if international organizations would be allowed to contribute relief.
Because of the earthquake-prone nature of Indonesia, the country is often hit by disasters unprepared.
While tsunami shelters have been built in Aceh, this is not the case on the other coast.
The lack of tsunami warnings in Palu, despite the existence of warning systems, is highly likely to have contributed to the death toll.
Traveling between Indonesia's many islands is often difficult.
Disasters make the equipment more difficult.
A hospital ship parked in Lombok to treat earthquake victims is en route to Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the new disaster area.
In his campaign, President Joko Widodo exploited Indonesia's failed infrastructure to win election and misappropriated funds for road and railway construction.
But the lack of funding for various projects has been a major factor in Mr Joko's reign as he faces re-election next year.
Mr. Joko is also under pressure from the inter-religious wars in Indonesia where the majority of Muslims are more conservative in their beliefs.
More than 1,000 people were killed and thousands displaced as Christian and Muslim militants fought in the streets, using picks, bows, arrows and other traditional weapons.
See: Liverpool player Daniel Sturridge scored the penalty against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a Premier League defeat to Chelsea with an 89th-minute goal on Saturday at Stamford Bridge in London.
Sturridge was delivered by Xherdan Shaqiri at 27 metres from Chelsea's goal in a 1-0 defeat.
The ball is passed to his left before he shoots the second ball.
The shot went to the upper right corner of the screen.
The ball eventually came down through the Kepa Arrizabalaga and shook the net.
Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com: "I tried to get in that position to get the ball and players like Shaq always play as close as possible, so I tried to find a way to get the ball as close as possible.
"I saw Kante coming and I touched the ball once, without thinking too much about it and I shot".
Chelsea led 1-0 at half-time after scoring a 25th-minute goal from Belgian star Eden Hazard.
The blue-coated attacking midfielder gave a late pass to Mateo Kovacic in the game, before running into the midfield to Liverpool's half.
Kovacic scored and passed the ball into the middle of the field.
He then fires a perfect shot at Hazard who was in the middle of the field.
Hazard ran over the guards and threw the ball into the net with his left foot past Liverpool defender Alisson Becker.
Liverpool face Napoli in the group stage of the first European club competition to be called the Champions League at 3pm on Wednesday at the Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will face Videoton in the UEFA Europa League at 3pm on Thursday in London.
The death toll from the Indonesian tsunami rises to 832
The death toll from the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia has risen to 832, the National Disaster Management Agency announced early Sunday.
It was reported that many people were trapped in the rubble of the building that was destroyed by the 7.5 magnitude earthquake on Friday and hit a 6-meter high mudstone, the company's spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said at a press conference.
The city of Palu, home to over 380,000 people, is filled with building debris.
Police arrested a 32-year-old man on suspicion of murder after a woman was stabbed to death
An investigation into the murder began after the body of a woman was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside this morning.
A 44-year-old woman was found at 7:55 a.m. with stab wounds in Grayson Mews on John Street, where a 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
Police urged residents who saw or heard anything to report.
"The investigation is still in its infancy", said Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan, "but I would urge anyone who was in the John Street area of Birkenhead who saw or heard anything suspicious to report it".
I would appreciate it if anyone, especially taxi drivers, could have video and dashboard cameras to let us know because they may have information that is important to the investigation we are conducting.'
A police spokesman confirmed that the body of the woman found in the Birkenhead area is found inside the house.
Later this afternoon, friends who believe they know the woman arrived at the scene to ask questions about her whereabouts this morning.
The investigation is still ongoing while the police said that a mechanism was being prepared to notify the next of kin of the deceased.
A taxi driver from Grayson Mews tried to return to his apartment but was told by police that no one was allowed to enter or leave the building.
He said what he said when he learned what had happened.
Now, residents have been told that it will take several hours for them to be allowed back in.
A police officer was heard telling someone that the entire area would now be considered a crime area.
A woman appeared weeping at the scene of sin.
He continued, 'It's very scary.'
At 2 p.m., two police officers were in front of the crime scene and another truck parked outside.
Several police officers were standing in front of the crime scene, checking various floors.
Anyone with information is asked to immediately email @MerPolCC, call 101 or contact the unnamed Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111, according to the 247 report dated September 30.
The Cromwell Monument in Parliament is the latest monument to the 're-writing of history' challenge.
The ban on the hanging of the pottery would be seen as punishment for the destruction of British cultural and religious objects similar to those carried out by the Taliban by the Puritans.
But the Cromwell Society described Mr. Crick's proposal as "crazy" and as "an attempt to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, president of the Cromwell Society, said: "There is no escape from this discussion about the removal of the statues of Oliver Cromwell outside Westminster Palace and the possibility of a raid.
It is a depiction of the English Civil Wars, none of which were either condemned or opposed by Cromwell.
Cromwell's only possible fault was the actions of his first-century ancestor Thomas.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft's portrayal of Cromwell is a typical example of what in the 19th century was thought of as any aspect of pottery history that many believe should still be appreciated.
Mr Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is regarded by many, perhaps more in the late 19th century than today, as having given the power of Parliament away from the shadow of the outsiders to the monarchy.
Whether this is the case is a continuing debate in the historical record.
What is more, the conflicts of the mid-17th century were caused by the development of our own countries and Cromwell is a well-known individual who shows one side of the divide.
His achievements as Lord Protector should also be celebrated and remembered".
A killer pig bites a Chinese farmer to death
A farmer was attacked and killed by pigs in a market in southwest China, according to media reports.
The man, known only as "Yuan", was found dead from a ruptured artery, covered in blood from a pig's fish pond in Liupanshui in Guizhou province, the South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
A pig farmer prepares to vaccinate pigs in a pig pen on May 30, 2005 in Xining in Qinghai Province, China.
He reportedly went to his cousin in the neighboring Yunna district on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs at the market.
The next morning, her cousin found her dead and found the door to the nearby pigsty open.
He said that in the pig pen there was a pig with blood in its mouth.
A scientific analysis of the evidence confirmed that a 226 kg pig had eaten the farmer to death, according to the report.
His cousin called him by another name: "My cousin's leg was bloody and severely bruised", as his words were quoted by the Guiyang Evening News.
Video captured by a security camera showed Yuan entering the market at 4:40 a.m. on Thursday to feed his pigs.
Her body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed the man was neither Yuan's nor his cousin's.
The market manager told the Evening News that the pig was locked up to prevent it from shooting itself while police were gathering evidence at the scene.
Yuan's family and the management of the store said they were discussing the circumstances surrounding his death.
Although rare, pig problems have occurred before.
In 2016, a pig attacked a couple on their farm in Massachusetts, leaving the husband severely injured.
A decade earlier, a 295-pound pig had tied a farmer in the Peyrie de Gale to his car until the woman had to release the pig.
After an Oregon piggy bank robbed its pigs in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs are not uncommonly aggressive but that eating blood may be the "cause of aggression".
He said, "They want to play.
They are sleepy, very curious ... they are not meant to bother you.
You have to respect it properly", he said.
Hurricane Rosa brought heavy rainfall across much of the southwestern United States.
In terms of weather, the fast-moving tropical storm Rosa is weakening as it travels through the icy waters off the northern coast of Mexico.
However, the fast-moving superstorm Rosa will bring floodwaters to northern Mexico and the southwestern United States in the coming days.
The super-tropical cyclone Rosa had winds of 136 km/h, a category 1 super-tropical cyclone, as of 5:00 a.m. eastern time Sunday, and was observed 620 km southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa is expected to travel north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, the storm is forming in the Pacific basin and is moving westward along the U.S. West Coast, with Rosa approaching the Baja California Peninsula on Monday as a tropical storm that will move to the tropical lowlands of the north and southwest.
Rosa will bring rainfall of up to 25 cm in parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then, the tropical climate will meet the approaching monsoon to create heavy rainfall in the southwest in the coming days.
In this area, rainfall of 2.5 to 10 cm can cause severe flooding, debris flooding and mudslides in the desert.
Severe tropical cyclones will cause rainfall of 5 to 7 cm per hour at once; particularly in southern Nevada and Arizona.
Rainfall of 5 to 10 cm is expected in the southern parts, mainly in Arizona.
Rapid flooding is possible where it may be reduced by the scattered rainfall of the tropics.
It may not be a good idea to walk into a desert where tropical rainfall is likely.
Heavy rains can turn valleys into raging rivers and thunderstorms can bring strong winds and dust.
The storm is expected to bring heavy rainfall to coastal areas of southern California.
Rainfall of up to 1 cm (1 inch) could cause minor damage to flow and cause the roads to slide.
This would be the first rains in the region during the rainy season.
Some of the more localized tropical rainfall will begin to approach Arizona during the high hours of Sunday and early hours of Monday, before the more frequent rainfall during the high hours of Monday and early hours of Tuesday.
Heavy rain will hit the Four Corners on Tuesday and Wednesday.
October could see a major warming in the Americas as the Arctic cools, but the tropics continue to warm.
Sometimes it results in large temperature changes with small gaps.
There was a significant example of a large temperature difference between the United States on Sunday.
There is a temperature difference of about 20 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
In the next few days, summer heat will try to come and reach the area again.
Most of the Midwest is expected to experience temperatures of around 26 degrees Celsius from the southern plain to the northeastern parts of the United States from October.
New York City could experience a temperature of 26 degrees Celsius on Tuesday, nearly 10 degrees above the average.
Our long-term forecast indicates that there is a high probability that above-average temperatures could reach parts of the eastern United States by the first half of October.
Over 20 million people watched Brett Kavanaugh's trial
More than 20 million people watched the dramatic testimony of future Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh and the woman accusing him of sexual assault allegedly committed in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford, on six television channels.
Meanwhile, political tensions continued, with television news anchors interrupting Friday's regular show at the last minute: It was a deal made by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake to have the FBI investigate the allegations within a week.
Ford told the Senate Appropriations Committee that he was 100 percent sure that Kavanaugh had abused him while he was drinking and tried to strip him from a high school party.
Kavanaugh, the ultimate witness, said he was 100 percent sure that this never happened.
It is likely that more than 20.4 million people were notified by Nielsen on Friday that they had watched it.
The company was calculating the average viewership of CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
Data was not immediately available from other television stations that showed evidence including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen typically has problems with the number of people watching the news in the office.
To be clear, they are people who are the same age as the people in the pay-per-view or the Academy Awards.
Nielsen notes:  Fox News Channel, which has a strong guest host supporting Kavanaugh's appointment, leads the network with an average of 5.69 million viewers for the entire day.
ABC was the first with 3.26 million viewers.
Nielsen says: "CBS was watched by 3.1 million, NBC by 2.4 million, MSNBC by 2.89 million and CNN by 2.52 million".
There is still much to be learned after the trial.
Flake was the focus of Friday's events.
After the Republican caucus announced that it would vote for Kavanaugh, he was caught on CNN and CBS cameras on Friday morning and beaten by protesters as he attempted to enter the elevator to attend the Judiciary Committee hearing.
He stood his eyes down for several minutes as the criticism was broadcast on CNN.
"I'm standing right here in front of you", said one woman.
"Do you think he is telling the truth to the entire country?
She was told, "You are a very powerful woman when most women are not".
Flake said his office had a surprise and said that before the censor closed, he had spoken at the committee hearing.
The network was on the air immediately afterward, when the Appeals Committee voted to move Kavanaugh's nomination to the next level for a Senate vote.
But Flake said he would only do so if he knew the FBI would want to review the charges against the nominee next week, which is what a few Democrats were calling for.
Flake was reported to have been one of the speakers at a meeting with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After a discussion with Coons and other senators later, Flake made a decision.
Flake's choice was strong, as it was clear that Republicans would not have to vote to confirm Kavanaugh without an investigation.
President Trump opened an FBI investigation into the Kavanaugh allegations.
UK Prime Minister May accuses critics of 'political gambling' over Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of her plans to leave the European Union of "political gambling" on the future of Britain and undermining the country's interests in an interview with the Sunday Times.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives at the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, England, on 29 September 2018.
In another interview following a front-page interview, former Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson attacked his Brexit strategy, calling the idea that the UK and EU should both pay taxes "absolutely unusual".
Wayde Sims Massacre: Police arrest suspect, Dyteon Simpson, in the death of LSU player
Police arrested suspected shooter Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old LSU basketball player.
Baton Rouge Police Department said that Dyteon Simpson, 20, was arrested and detained on a charge of second-degree murder.
Police released a video of Sims and Simpson's fight and Police said Sims lost his legs in the fight.
CBS affiliate WAFB reports that police found the leaflets at the scene and said they found Simpson's DNA.
After questioning Simpson, police said he admitted to shooting and killing Wayde.
His lawyer says the bail for his provisional release is $350,000.
The East Baton Rouge Parish Coroner's Office released a preliminary report Friday, stating that he died from gunshot wounds to the head and neck.
The Department of Police would like to thank the Louisiana State Police Fugitive Crime Station, the Louisiana State Police Crime Lab, the Southern University Police Department and the local community for their assistance in the investigation that led to the arrest of the suspect.
LSU athletic director Joe Alleva thanked local police for "their discernment and follow-up to ensure fairness".
Sims was 20 years old.
The 6-foot-2 athlete grew up in Baton Rouge, where his stepfather, Wayne, also played basketball for LSU.
He averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game last season.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team was "disappointed" and "deeply saddened" by Waydeh's death.
"This is what we're always worried about", says Wade.
Volcano erupts in Mexico City
The Popocatepetl volcano's ash plume reached the southern tip of Mexico City.
On Saturday, the National Disaster Management Agency warned Mexicans against approaching the volcano after it reignited at its base and was reported to have emitted 183 million cubic meters of greenhouse gases over 24 hours.
The center was following a number of grievances and procedures.
Images on social media showed dust covering car windshields in neighborhoods such as Xochimilco in Mexico City.
Geologists observed a surge of volcanic activity 72 km southeast of the city during a magnitude 7.1 earthquake that struck central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano known as "Don Goyo" has been erupting since 1994.
Police join Catalan independence campaigners ahead of independence day
On Saturday, six people were arrested in Barcelona after pro-independence protesters clashed with the Riot Police, and thousands of people gathered to celebrate the anniversary of the Catalan independence election.
A group of masked pro-independence protesters were pushed back by the riot police, who threw eggs and paint at them, creating a dark cloud of dust in the streets, which are usually crowded with tourists.
Fighting broke out in the hours leading up to the day when police were using a fence to cover up the fighting.
Pro-independence groups chanted "We will not forget, we will not forgive" for hours as they confronted the pro-independence protesters with the slogan "Spain lives forever".
A local newspaper reported that fourteen people were treated for minor injuries from the protests.
Tensions remain high between the pro-independence faction one year after the October 1 referendum was declared illegal by Madrid but welcomed by Catalans who want independence.
Voters chose independence, despite the small turnout and the large number of opponents to the vote.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after police blocked the election at various polling stations in the region in violent clashes.
On Friday, pro-independence groups had camped overnight to prevent protests in support of the National Police.
Protests took place but were forced to take place elsewhere.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who took part in the independence protests with his wife, said there was no longer any hope for Catalonia's independence.
He said, "Last year was a good year for us.
I saw my parents cry tears of joy because they got to vote, but now we have nothing to do".
Despite a small victory in the regional elections in December last year, pro-independence parties in Catalonia have been struggling to hold on to the victory this year, with many prominent asylum officials or detainees awaiting trial for their role in organizing the campaign and declaring independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who was filmed supporting the police protests on her mobile phone, said the clashes were caused by politicians on both sides.
He said, "It's going to get stronger".
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan regional leaders who has been in pre-trial detention since last year, announced that he would run for the European Parliament election next year.
"Being a candidate in the European elections is the best way to protest against the regression of democratic values and oppression we have seen in the Spanish presidency".
Londonderry: Men arrested after house hit by car
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested after a car reportedly hit a house in Londonderry.
The incident took place at Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at around 19:30 UK time.
Deputy inspector Bob Blemmings said that the damage was to the gates and the building itself.

Menga's goal in the second half gave Livingston a 1-0 win over Rangers
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston won the game
Premier League club Livingston surprised Rangers with a second defeat by Steven Gerrard in 18 games as manager of Ibrox.
Dolly Menga's goal made a difference as Gary Holt's second-placed side found Hibernian.
Gerrard's side continued to go winless at home in the Championship this season and will face league top scorer Hearts, who are eight points behind on Sunday.
Prior to that, Rangers will host Rapid Vienna in the Europa League qualifiers on Thursday.
Livingston, meanwhile, has continued to extend its unbeaten run in the league to six games, with head coach Holt facing a loss since replacing Kenny Miler last month.
Livingston lost the chance to beat a weaker team
Holt should be in the lead before winning, while his unwaveringness is causing all the problems for Rangers.
Scott Robinson managed to pass the defenders but the ball passed by the side of the goal and Alan Lithgow was able to throw the ball out of bounds after a slip to meet the ball from Craig Halkett's head.
The hosts were happy to let the Rangers play in front of them, knowing they could challenge their visitors at the exhibition balls.
Thus, a necessary goal was reached.
Rangers lost the opening ball and Livingston opened the scoring, with Declan Gallagher and Robinson matching the goal-scoring formulas, with Menga hitting the center of the field.
At that level, Rangers were very particular about the ball but found the back wall of the team they visited to be unbreakable and the goalkeeper, Liam Kelly, was not able to get the ball off the ground.
The game continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos threw the ball and Kelly returned it.
Scott Pittman's shot was taken off by Rangers defender Allan McGregor and Lithgow jumped after another save by Livingston.
The shots continued to come in the Livingston goal area but were repeated to the goal, while two penalties were called after Halkett's mistake on substitute Glenn Middleton and a handball, both of which were not delivered.
Analysis says Livingston's team played in 'unusual style'
BBC Scotland reporter Alasdair Lamont at the Tony Macaroni Arena
The exceptional performance was a successful game for Livingston.
They certainly played well, continuing to play well as the game progressed.
Their performance and individual skills have changed little since their return to the top flight, but Holt has been credited with setting the club on a high note since his arrival.
He has a lot of good players.
Captain Halkett played well, line up the rebounders, while Menga took down Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall for the rest of the game.
The Rangers did not do much on the field.
They have been playing well since they started with Gerrard, but now they have not done anything great.
The final ball did not reach the defender, only once they hit a home run, but this resulted in the Rangers, now in the middle of the league table.
Erdogan received a mixed reception in Cologne
On Saturday, some laughed and others were unhappy (September 29) as the Turkish and German leaders met for breakfast in Berlin.
It was the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, which was aimed at improving relations between NATO military allies.
They disagreed on issues including human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's accession to the European Union.
Erdogan then went to Cologne to open a new large mosque.
The city is home to the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
Police cited security reasons as the reason why 25,000 people were prevented from gathering in front of the mosque, but many of his supporters came to the area to see their president.
Hundreds of people protested against Erdogan, many of them Kurds, and raised their voices against Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to welcome him to the country.
The resulting protests and clashes reflected the disagreement of the visitor who was regarded as a leader by some German Turks and by others as a dictator.
Deptford road accident: cyclist killed in collision with car
A man died in a car accident in London.
The accident occurred near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn, a busy street in Deptford, southeast of the city around 10:15 UK time.
The driver of the car stopped and emergency workers helped him, but the driver died at the scene.
A recent accident involved another pedestrian being hit by an unidentified vehicle on Childers Road, one and a half kilometres from the scene of Saturday's accident.
The traffic police said that the police would work to identify the man and inform his relatives.
The road was closed and the buses and motorcycles were advised to avoid the area.
Long Lartin Prison: Six officers wounded in clashes
The prison director announced that six guards were injured in clashes in the maximum security men's prison.
The fighting began at HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire around 09:30 UK time on Sunday and is ongoing.
The official "Tornados" were brought in to deal with the fighting, which included eight prisoners and were kept in a cell.
The officers were treated at the scene for blunt force trauma to the face.
A prison spokesperson said: "Special trained guards have been brought in to deal with the fighting at HMP Long Lartin.
Six prison guards were wounded.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons and we have made it clear that those involved will be handed over to the police and their detention period may be extended".
HMP Long Lartin prison houses over 500 inmates, including some of the nation's most notorious criminals.
In June, it was reported that the police chief was hospitalized after being attacked by a prisoner.
And in October last year, riot police were called in to deal with a violent prison riot where workers were attacked with balls of ammunition.
Rapidly moving Rose volcano is worrying about Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City due to rapid flooding (Drought areas can benefit)
Tropical cyclones are unusual in Arizona, but they are most likely to occur early next week when the remnants of Hurricane Rosa reach the southwestern desert, causing rapid flooding.
The National Weather Service has issued a flash flood warning for Monday and Tuesday from western Arizona to southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to take a direct route to Phoenix on Tuesday, approaching the rainy Monday hours.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix reported that "ten tropical storms have produced hurricanes within 200 miles [200 km] of Phoenix since 1950!
Hurricane Katrina (1967) was the most intense hurricane to hit the country from within 40 miles (64 km) of the AZ border.
The National Hurricane Center has modeled rainfall from 5 to 10 centimeters, with a potential of up to 15 centimeters in the Mogollon Rim region of Arizona.
Other areas of the southwestern desert including the central Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin can experience rainfall ranging from 2 to 5 cm, with some areas reaching up to 10 cm.
For those who are not at risk of flash floods, Rosa's rains can be a blessing after a drought-stricken area.
While flooding is a major concern, some of this rainfall could be beneficial in the arid southwest.
Weather.com reports that according to the National Drought Monitoring Center, more than 40 percent of Arizona is experiencing at least severe drought, the highest level.
First, Rosa's path leads to the Baja California peninsula in Mexico.
Rosa, still at tropical strength on Sunday with maximum sustained winds of 136 km/h, is 620 km south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico and is moving north at 20 km/h.
The wind is meeting the icy waters of the Pacific Ocean and causing it to slow down.
So it is expected to make landfall in Mexico with tropical storm force on Monday afternoon or evening.
Rainfall in parts of Mexico may be heavy, causing severe flooding.
"A combined rainfall of between 7 and 15 cm is expected from Baja California to northeastern Sonora, where up to 25 cm is possible", says Weather.com.
Rosa will then continue northward through Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the Arizona border in the early morning hours of Tuesday during the tropical cyclone, which will continue its path through Arizona into southern Utah in the late hours of Tuesday night.
"The primary concern for Rosa or its associated cyclones is heavy rainfall in Baja California, northwestern Sonora and the southwestern desert", states the National Hurricane Center.
The rains were expected to bring flash floods that could kill lives and carry debris to the desert, and bring mud to mountainous areas.
Midsomer Norton attack: Four suspects arrested for attempted murder
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man have been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old was found with stab wounds in Somerset.
The teenager was found injured in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton, around 04:00 am UK time on Saturday.
He was taken to hospital where he is still receiving treatment but is "not feeling well".
Police say a 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man were arrested overnight in the Radstock area, Avon and Somerset.
Police have asked anyone who may have a cell phone recording of the incident to report.
Trump says Kavanaugh 'had to deal with the anger and brutality of the Democratic Party'
Trump said during his campaign in Wheeling, West Virginia, "Electing Judge Kavanaugh is electing to denounce the vicious and destructive tickets of the Democratic Party".
Trump said that Kavanaugh "has been consistent with the anger and brutality" of the Democratic Party throughout his nomination process.
On Thursday, Kavanaugh began testifying before Congress in a strong and emotional denial of Christine Blasey Ford's allegations that she sexually abused him decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also testifies in the trial of his allegations.
On Saturday, the president said, "Americans saw the genius, the beauty and the enthusiasm" of Kavanaugh that day.
"Voting for Judge Kavanaugh is voting to affirm the many accomplishments of the greatest jurist of our time, a jurist who has done extraordinary things for the people", he told a crowd of supporters in West Virginia.
The president directly referred to Kavanaugh's nomination while talking about the importance of Republican majorities in the midterm elections.
"We are five weeks away from some of the most important elections of our time.
I am not promoting myself, but I am promoting myself".
"That is why I am everywhere fighting for the strong Indians".
Trump said Democrats have a "restriction and inhibition" agenda.
A Republican official told CNN that the first step in the election is for the Senate to approve Kavanaugh's nomination no later than Friday.
Hundreds killed in earthquake, tsunami in Indonesia, where death toll continues to rise
On Saturday, officials said at least 384 people were killed, many by a coastal tsunami, when a powerful earthquake and tsunami struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi.
On Friday, more than a hundred people gathered at a beach festival in Palu city when a six-meter (18 ft) high wave hit the shore in the evening, killing dozens and destroying everything in its path.
The tsunami was followed by a 7.5-magnitude earthquake.
"When the tsunami intensified yesterday, people were still doing their activities on the beach and did not immediately flee and it killed them", said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesperson for Indonesia's National Disaster Management Bureau (BNPB), in an interview in Jakarta.
"The tsunami did not come in vain", said Nugroho, "it came with cars, bicycles, water, and nothing on the ground", adding that the tsunami reached the sea at 800 kilometers per hour (497 miles per hour) before hitting the coast.
He says that some people have climbed trees to become tsunamis and survived.
About 16,700 people were evacuated from the disaster area to 24 camps in Palu.
Aerial photographs released by the National Disaster Management Agency showed many buildings and shops destroyed, bridges damaged and other structures destroyed, and mosques flooded.
On Saturday, a small aftershock continued to hit coastal cities.
Various earthquakes have been felt in areas with a population of 2.4 million.
The Indonesian Bureau of Experimental and Technological Technology (BPPT) reported that Friday's quake was nearly 200 times the size of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima during World War II.
The report goes on to say that because of the city's geography, it is located on a coastal area that can increase the severity of tsunamis.
Nugroho described the damage as "severe" and said thousands of homes, clinics, shops and hotels were destroyed.
The bodies of the victims of the disaster were found in the rubble of collapsed buildings, adding to the 540 injured and 29 missing.
Nugroho said casualties and damage could be more along the coastline about 300 km (190 mi) north of Palu, in the area known as Donggala, which is close to the epicentre of the earthquake.
Nugroho says that receiving and transmitting information was "very compromised where no information could circulate" from Donggala.
The Red Cross estimates the area's population at 300,000", adding that its staff and volunteers will be deployed to the affected areas.
"It's already been dangerous, but it could be worse".
On Saturday, the agency said it had been severely criticized for not reporting the tsunami had hit Palu, but officials said the waves came as they had started warning the community.
In amateur photographs shared on social media, a man is seen on the roof of a building screaming and warning of a tsunami coming to the street below him.
Within minutes, a huge flood washed ashore, sweeping away buildings and cars.
Reuters could not immediately confirm the images.
The earthquake and tsunami have caused a blackout in Palu, making it difficult for authorities to coordinate relief efforts.
The military has begun sending cargo planes carrying aid from Jakarta and other cities, officials said, as people evacuated from the disaster area are in dire need of food and other basic necessities.
The city's airport was extended to provide relief and remain closed until October.
On Sunday, President Joko Widodo was expected to visit evacuation centers in Palu.
The death toll from the Indonesian tsunami has risen to 800.
It is very bad.
Mr. Doseba said that when World Vision staff from Donggala arrived in Palu City, where staff had stayed in Tarpaulin's cabins to set up their office in the yard, they had passed through the disaster-prone area to reach the gas station.
"They told me that they saw many houses destroyed".
It is very bad.
Although relief teams have begun relief efforts, some complain that highly experienced international aid workers would be prevented from entering Palu.
Under the provisions of the Indonesian Financial Regulations, foreign equipment and personnel may be required to work when disaster relief is declared to be national disaster response.
It would not be.
"It is still a provincial epidemic", said a spokesperson for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"When the government says no, 'No problem, it's a national emergency,' we can open up international aid but the situation would have been better".
As the second night arrived in Palu after Friday's earthquake and tsunami, friends and families of the missing were hopeful that their loved ones would miraculously be found and survive the disaster.
On Saturday, a young boy was pulled from the car.
On Sunday, rescuers rescued a woman who had been trapped in the rubble for two days with her mother's body next to her.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of the Indonesian national cross-country ski team, had trained two missing athletes for the Olympics, which ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
Mr. Mandagi said that the others who were arrested at the Roa Roa Hotel were his students.
"As a head trainer of dirt walking, I have my own unique passions".
Mr. Gendon said that, hours after the news of the Roa Roa Hotel falling into the mudslides, he sent several WhatsApp messages with regret to the Palu competitors, who were at a beach festival.
Only his message, which turned out to be sent but not read.
He said, "I think the message is not read".
Thieves steal $26,750 while pulling it from an ATM at Newport in Levee
On Friday morning, thieves stole $26,750 from a Brink employee who was withdrawing money from an ATM at Newport in Levee, according to information released by the Newport Police Department.
The driver of the car was about to withdraw money from the ATM machine in the casino and was preparing to give the money away, according to the report by investigating officer Dennis McCarthy.
While he was busy, another man "came running from behind Brink's clerk" and stole his bag of money.
Witnesses saw several suspects fleeing the scene, according to reports, but police did not specify the exact number of people involved in the robbery.
Anyone with information about the identities of the individuals should call Newport Police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper changed his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West is changing his name to Ye.
On Saturday, he announced the changes on Twitter, saying: "I officially know my name as Kanye West".
West, 41, has since taken the stage name Ye and dubbed his eighth studio album, which was released in June.
The changes came before his appearance on Saturday Night Live, where he is set to release his new album Yandhi.
The producer said he replaced the singer Ariana Grande in an interview where she said she did not die "for emotional reasons".
Even as a pseudonym for his professional name, West once said that the word has a religious meaning to him.
Earlier this year Wese said while discussing his album and hosting the radio show Big Boy that he "believes 'he' is the most commonly used word in the Bible and in the Bible it means 'you (you) '.
"So I am you, I am we, we are we.
It's from Kanye, which means a girl, which is Him; which is a picture of the good, the bad we do, the confusing, each one.
The album is a reflection of who we are".
He is one of the few rappers to have changed his name.
Sean Combs was known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced his preference for the name Love and Brother Love.
West's former partner, JAY-Z, also spells the name with a hyphen or capitalized.
Mexican President Amlo vows to stop using military force against civilians
Mexican President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has vowed never to use military force against civilians as the country approaches the 50th anniversary of the bloody student uprising.
On Saturday, Lopez Obrador from the Tlatelolco Plaza assured that he "will never use the military to silence Mexicans".
Military shots were fired at peaceful protesters at the palace on October 2, 1968, killing 300 during the growing student uprising in Central America.
Lopez Obrador assured that the Mexican youth would be helped by financial support for students and the opening of several public universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities lead to youths joining criminal organizations.
America should double the money spent on artificial intelligence
While China is engaged in a massive AI project, the United States should double its spending on AI research, said AI entrepreneur and inventor Kai-Fu Lee, who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
This suggestion comes after several U.S. government departments made statements about artificial intelligence; although the U.S. generally has no known policies on artificial intelligence.
Meanwhile, China launched its own initiative last year: aiming to be the number one innovator in artificial intelligence by 2030.
"Doubling the budget for AI research would be a good start", Lee says, "because other countries are still far behind the United States and we are looking at how to achieve higher levels of AI".
Doubling funding could double the chances of major intellectual property projects being completed in the United States, Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, author of the book "AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was released this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, CEO of Sinovation Ventures, a firm that invested in China's leading artificial intelligence firm, Face++.
In the 1980s, Carnegie Mellon University developed a system that outperformed the highly successful American actor Othello, who later became the executive vice president of Microsoft Research and head of Google's China division.
Lee endorsed the U.S. government's robotics competition, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's Robotics Challenge, and was asked when the next competition would be held to help identify the future engineers.
Lee says that American researchers often work hard to win government funding.
"China is not going to take away the best teachers, it's going to take away the companies", Lee said.
Facebook, Google and other tech companies have hired prominent academics to work on artificial intelligence projects over the past few years.
Lee said that changes in immigration policy could help the United States strengthen its creative mind.
"I believe that permanent residency in the United States, known as a green card, should be immediately granted to those who hold a master's degree in natural sciences".
The Chinese State Council issued a Plan for the Development of Artificial Intelligence in the Next Generation in July 2017.
Lee says that the Chinese nonprofit supports academics in the same way that the National Science Foundation and other government agencies fund US researchers, but that the quality of educational work in China is lower.
Earlier this year, the US Department of Defense established a Joint Intelligence Center, which means improved interaction between industry and academia, and the US President announced the formation of a Special Intelligence Review Committee.
And this month DARPA announced that it is investing $2 billion in a project called AI Next.
As for the NSF, it is currently investing over $100 million a year in artificial intelligence research.
Meanwhile, US lawmakers have called for the creation of a National Commission on Intellectual Property Security, after months of failure.
Macedonians vote to change the country's name
On Sunday, Macedonians voted to change the name to "Republic of North Macedonia", a move that could resolve the decades-old dispute with Greece over its bid for membership in the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which has a regional unit called Macedonia, claims that its northern neighbor is named after the region and has suspended the country's bid for membership in NATO and the European Union.
The two governments reached an agreement in June on the new name, but nationalist opponents say the change could undermine the identity of Macedonia's ethnically significant Serb population.
President Gjorge Ivanov has said he will not vote in the election and the publicity campaign has led to confusion over whether the low voter turnout will be enough to make the election a viable one.
The question in the referendum ballot box reads: "Do you agree to our membership in NATO and the European Union under the terms of the agreement with Greece?"
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, say it is a price to pay to continue to ensure accession to major organizations such as the European Union and NATO for Macedonia, one of the countries that broke away from Yugoslavia.
Olivera Georgijevska, 79, from Skopje, says: "I came here today to vote for the future of the country, for the youth of Macedonia; to live freely in the European Union because it means a more secure life for all of us".
Although not legally, enough MPs said they would respect the results of the election for a decision to be made.
A name change requires a two-thirds vote of the members of the Legislative Assembly.
The National Electoral Commission said no state of emergency was declared until 1 p.m.
However, turnout was only 16 percent, compared to 34 percent in the last parliamentary election in 2016 when 66 percent of registered voters cast ballots.
Tanevski, a 62-year-old voter in the capital Skopje, said: "I came to vote because my children, where we should live, is in Europe".
Prime Minister of Macedonia Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko voted in a referendum in Macedonia to change the country's name to NATO and the European Union in Strumica, Macedonia on 30 September 2018.
Outside the Skopje Parliament, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, was preparing a small podium and opening chairs in front of the tents set up by protesters.
"We need to join NATO and the European Union, but we want to join with determination, not through the door", Kavadarkov said.
"We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don't want to treat us like Macedonia, we can point to other countries like China and Russia and go to the Euro-Asian Union".
Prime Minister Zaev said NATO members are bringing much needed investment to Macedonia, where unemployment is over 20 percent.
After the vote, Zaev said, "I believe that the majority of the population will vote well because more than 80 percent of our population wants to join the European Union and NATO".
He said that the "yes" must be "a guarantee of our future".
A poll conducted Monday by the Macedonian Institute for Political Research showed that between 30 and 43 percent of voters are likely to vote in a referendum, a figure that was not required for the vote to be valid.
Another poll, conducted by the Macedonian television station Telma, found that 57 percent of respondents planned to vote on Sunday.
Of these, 70 percent said they would vote yes.
To be considered for the debate, a majority of 50 percent must be added to one vote.
If not, the debate would be seen as a challenge to the policy that has supported the Western government since it took power in May last year.
See: Manchester City player who scored against Brighton
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling cheered Brighton's fans in a 2-0 win over Manchester City on Saturday at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made a seemingly easy turn when he scored in the 65th minute.
The Argentine striker was given a ball in the middle of the field to exchange the ball at the start.
He ran between three of Brighton's back-rowers, before running out.
Aguero found himself surrounded by four green ball players.
He begged for a single substitute before running out and leaving several others on the side of Brighton's home team.
He then passes the ball to his left, to Sterling.
The English midfielder used his first-class ball to re-hit Aguero, who used his right foot to beat Brighton goalkeeper Mathew Ryan, who hit him in the right half of the defence.
City manager Pep Guardiola told reporters: "Aguero is struggling with problems with his legs".
"We said we could play for 55, 60 minutes.
And that is exactly what happened.
We were lucky that he scored a goal at that time".
But it was Sterling who gave the blue team their first chance to win a Premier League game.
The goal came in the 29th minute.
Aguero was given a ball that was in Brighton's goal net for the match.
He then sends a good ball to the left wing to Leroy Sane.
Sane paused before moving forward to reach Sterling where he had placed it on the other side of the pot.
The team's high-blue forward kicked the ball into the net before scoring and putting the ball back into the guard.
City will face Hoffenheim in the group stage of the European Championship at 12:55pm on Tuesday at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants the unnamed team to play the Rockies
With the Nationals eliminated from playoff contention, there was little reason to press for a replay.
But the ever-challenging Scherzer is confident he will be on the field on Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but in the playoffs he is playing for the Rockies, which is one game ahead of the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West.
The Rockies narrowly missed the playoffs with a 5-2 victory over the Nationals on Friday, but are still looking to win their first division title.
"While we are not playing, at least we can get to a stadium where we know the conditions here in Denver where many people and teams will be playing at the highest level of all the games that can be played this year.
Why don't I want to play the game?"
The Nationals are scheduled to announce the first game on Sunday, but it has been reported that they will allow Scherzer to play in the game.
Scherzer, who will start his 34th game, left his usual position on Thursday but will return to his usual position on Sunday.
The Washington right-hander is 18-7 with a 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings this season.
Trump campaigned in West Virginia
The president addressed the issue of his nominee for Supreme Court Chief Justice Brett Kavanaugh while discussing the importance of a Republican majority in the midterm elections.
"Everything we have done will be in jeopardy in November.
Five weeks remain before some of the most important elections of our time.
"This is a very important issue, I am not running but I am actually running and that is why I will not be running for any important candidates".
Trump continued: "You see this very bad, bad but very destructive group of Democrats, you see what's happening right now.
And they are determined to regain their strength by every means possible, see their cruelty, their wickedness.
They don't care who they hurt, who they have to push to get power and what they control, what they want and power and what they control, we won't give it to them".
Democrats have a "restriction and inhibition" program.
"And you see that in the last four days", he says of the Democrats, "they've been angry, cruel and evil and unfaithful".
He spoke to the Senate Judiciary Committee about Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein, who was immediately denounced in the audience.
"Do you remember his answer?
Have you ever published a document?
Uh, uh, what?
No, no, except for a little; that was the worst body language I've ever seen".
The Labour Party is no longer characterised by diversity.
It has become intolerant of opinion
When local Momentum activists voted against me, it was a complete surprise.
In short, I am the latest Labour MP to be told that I am not welcome to speak my mind.
My fellow congresswoman, Joan Ryan, was similarly arrested for speaking out against anti-Semitism.
In my case, the protest was critical because I disagree with Jeremy Corbyn.
The importance of accountability in economic policy, in national security, in Europe, has been overshadowed by issues that Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
A statement announcing Friday's Nottingham East Labour conference said: "We want the conference to be a successful and productive one".
For almost eight years as a Labour MP, Friday night's GC meeting was a success.
Unfortunately, today, many meetings are held in the wrong way and the "loving and friendly" political agreement was forgotten even before it was signed.
It has become increasingly apparent that diversity of opinion is not tolerated in the Labour Party and that each opinion must be determined whether it is acceptable to the party leadership.
This started shortly after Jeremy became leader, when those in the same party that I thought shared political views began to expect me to take a different direction and focus on something else I shouldn't have believed in; whether it was national security or the single market of the European Union.
Whenever I speak in public; and it doesn't matter what I say, there is a massive online outcry demanding that I be expelled from socialist politics, telling me that I should not be a member of the Labour Party.
And that is not my experience.
Yes, I know I am luckier than my peers because the opinions I get are politically motivated.
I am amazed at the professionalism and dedication of my colleagues who are sexually or colour-based victims of daily violence but do not give up.
One disappointing aspect of this political platform is the level of attacks where they are taken for granted.
Last week, Jeremy Corbyn said the Labour Party should be more tolerant.
The point is that we are not all dissidents and the act of voting or accusing someone of "disbelief" on certain party policies does not make the party grow.
I've been given a lot of advice over the last couple of years to keep my head down, to keep my mouth shut, so that "I'll be fine".
But that was not what led me into politics.
32 years after I joined the Labour Party as a student, and as a result of the negligence of the Thatcher government which left me with no confidence in all the education available, I sought to secure more public services for those who needed them most; whether as a consultant to a local government department or a government minister.
I have not hidden my politics, including during the last election.
No one in Nottingham East has been confused by my policies and where we disagree with the current leadership.
To those who took part in Friday's action, I would say that at a time when the country is heading towards the process of leaving the European Union known as Brexit and which will affect families, businesses and services to the public, I do not feel the need to waste time and energy on my integrity to the leader of the Labour Party.
In fact, my message is not to Nottingham Momentum, but to my constituents, whether Labour or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise that no threat of dismissal or political expectations will prevent me from doing more in what I believe is in your interest.
Chris Leslie is the Member of Parliament for Nottingham East
Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Ayr tops before defeat
Two goals from the penalty shoot-out were about to change the outcome of the match, but Ayr certainly deserved to win in this spectacular match that has been called Tennent's match of the day.
They now lead the league, the only undefeated team in the ten-team division.
Finally, it proved to be a team with strong defense, and even luck, which gave the host team and their coach Peter Murchie reason to be proud.
"We have been tested in the game so far and we have not lost, so I have to be happy".
Robyn Christie of Melrose said: "Congratulations to Ayr, they have been productive and have had a better chance than we have".
A shot by Grant Anderson in the 14th minute, scored by Frazier Climo, gave Ayr the lead, however, a yellow card was given to Scotland captain Rory Hughes, who was offered by the Warriors to play for the national team, who was allowed by Melrose to go on to the team and Jason Baggot attempted to score a goalless draw.
Climo added a penalty to Ayr's goal, before scoring a solo goal just before half-time to take a 17-5 lead over Ayr at the first-half break.
But Melrose started the second half well and a Patrick Anderson-hit Baggot-hit, cutting their lead by five points.
With a serious injury to Ruaridh Knott delaying the game, the match resumed, with Ayr still close to a Stafford McDowall goal from Climo.
Ayr vice-captain Blair Macpherson was given a yellow card and Melrose scored another run on a Bruce Colvine hit after a tight game.
The team that had come back to score the winning goal, was when Struan Hutchinson was given a yellow card for scoring Climo without the ball, just behind the goal line, MacPherson scored from behind to kick Ayr.
Climo scored as he did in the restart, after which Kyle Rowe caught David Armstrong in the backfield and sent the ball to winger Gregor Henry on his fifth attempt at the home team.
Still Game player prepares for new career in restaurant
Still Game player Ford Kieran appears to be ready to go on a reception after learning he has been summoned by a licensed executive at a restaurant company.
The 56-year-old actor plays Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC series, which he co-wrote and co-starred in with long-time co-star Greg Hemphill.
The duo announced that the ninth series will be the final film in the series and it looks like Kiernan is planning a life after Craiglang.
According to the information provided in the form of a complaint, he is the director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actress declined to comment on the news, although a source close to the Scottish Sun made it clear that Kiernan wanted to be included in Glasgow's "prosperous restaurant business".
'The sea is ours': landlocked Bolivia hopes to reopen the Pacific route
The maritime security forces are the Navy's strongest and are based in La Paz.
Government buildings have a blue flag raised high.
The Titicaca Navy patrol from the Amazon with the motto: "We have the right to the sea.
We take it as a responsibility".
Bolivia's landlocked nation is currently celebrating its losing battle for the coast with Chile in the bloody 19th century conflict, while the desire to sail the Pacific Ocean once again is strong.
This is perhaps the most optimistic view in decades, as Bolivia awaits the outcome of the international inquiry on October 1 after five years of waiting for a decision.
"Bolivia is a strong, united and stable country and expects a decision to be made in its favor", said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Bolivians will look to the International Court of Justice's decision on the acres of land across the country, hoping that the Lahey court will find Bolivia's claim valid; after decades of fruitless negotiations, Chile was forced to negotiate a land grant to Bolivia.
Evo Morales, the talented and patriotic president of Bolivia, is running for re-election next year; he is also very confident that Monday's decision will go well.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific", he vowed in late August.
But some analysts believe that the court will not just decide in favor of Bolivia and will make a minor change.
The UN mission in the Netherlands has no authority to assign the Shiri region and says it cannot determine the outcome of the talks.
Paz ZÃ¡rate, a Shiri-based international law expert, said: "The ICJ decision comes just six months after the trial found the complaint to be "not complicated".
To further illustrate Bolivia's aspirations, the past four years may have set back the gains.
"The problem of sea contact has been taken over by the present Bolivian government", ZÃ¡rate said.
He says that the words aimed at ending Morales' war have made the remaining rebels feel better.
Bolivia and Chile have maintained their relationship, but it will be very difficult for them to maintain communication after the pandemic.
The two countries have not returned ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo RodrÃ­guez VeltzÃ©, Bolivia's ambassador to Lahey, rejected the suggestion that the hasty court decisions were unnecessary.
On Monday, it will give Bolivia "a unique opportunity to forge a new relationship with Shiri" and "put an end to a 139-year-old conflict that will benefit both sides".
Calzadilla also denied that Morales, still one of Central America's most popular presidents, would use the issue of maritime rights for political gain.
"Bolivia will never renounce its right to operate in the Pacific Ocean".
"This decision is an opportunity to see if we should forget the past".
North Korea says nuclear disarmament will not happen until it can trust the US
North Korea's foreign minister, Ri Yong Ho, says his country will never stop developing nuclear weapons as long as it does not trust Washington.
Ri made the remarks on Saturday at the UN General Assembly.
He called on the UN to implement the agreement reached at a meeting in Singapore between the disagreeing leaders.
He made the remarks as Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appeared to be close to resuming talks on nuclear weapons that had apparently stalled after three months of talks in Singapore with North Korean President Kim Jong Un.
Ri says that it is "impossible" that sanctions continue and that the United States continues to refuse to publicly declare an end to the war with Korea, which does not put North Korea on its knees.
Washington is hesitant to issue a declaration if Pyongyang does not take the first steps toward denuclearization.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump want a second summit.
But Pyongyang is widely criticized for insisting on denuclearization as the only way to ensure its security.
Pompeo is planning to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second Kim-Trump summit.
A fashion show in Paris showcases new clothes to be delivered to the streets near you
If you want to add to your helmet or protect yourself from the sun, don't go far.
Fashion designers Valentino and Thom Browne have unveiled a giant hat in the SS19 collection on the street where the fashion week kicked off in Paris.
Big-shoe hats have been widely featured on Instagram this summer and the makers have been showing off their designs at fashion shows.
Valentino's unique beige hat has a wing-shaped handle that extends forward toward the head.
Other accompaniments to larger garments include a top hat, a large-brimmed hat, and a pineapple, but they are not designed to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also showed a group of amazing masks as Halloween approaches.
Many of the colored masks painted with lipstick are more Hannibal Lecter than specifically painted.
One of the masks was made to resemble a diving suit with a breathing tube and lights, while the other resembled a crumbled ice cream.
And if you keep talking about the big diamonds, you're in luck.
The giant chimpanzees are expected to reach highways near you.
The large hats are going to look like 'La Bomba', a 60 cm long hardwood hat that has been worn by celebrities from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
A well-known brand of giant hat advertised on the world wide web has re-launched its latest product at the fashion show, a hardwood bag to be carried on a sandy beach the size of a model wearing a sewing machine.
The box made from the leaves of the orange raffia tree, which was first roasted, with the leaves of the tree and a white leather handle on top, was the flagship in Jacquemus' collection La Riviera SS19 at Paris Fashion Week.
"I expect the big hat and sandbags will be on the high street this summer", celebrity wearer Luke Armitage told FEMAIL, "while the designer has made a big change to the oversized outfit".
John Edward: Language is essential to the world's population
Independent schools in Scotland have continued to advance in the field of education and this has been further confirmed in 2018 with further excellent test results, further emphasising the individual and overall achievements of students in sport, the arts, music and other community activities.
With around 30,000 pupils across Scotland, the schools, represented by the Scottish Independent Schools Council (SCIS), strive to achieve the highest standard of quality services for both pupils and parents.
Private schools aim to better prepare their students for higher education, career choices and a place in the global community.
As the education sector can develop and implement a student-friendly school curriculum, we are seeing new languages becoming increasingly popular and a subject of choice for students in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "When you speak to someone in a language they understand, what you say goes to their head.
When you speak to him in his native language, what you say reaches his heart".
This is a powerful reminder that we must not rely solely on English if we want to have positive relations with people from other countries.
From the results of the latest examinations of this year, we can see that languages are at the top of the list with the highest failure rate in private schools.
A total of 68 percent of students who studied a foreign language scored above A.
Data collected by SCIS from 74 member schools showed that 72% of students scored A in Mandarin, 72% in German, 69% in French and 63% in Spanish.
It shows that independent schools in Scotland are supporting foreign languages as an important skill set that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Now languages, like the subject of choice, are included with other STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) subjects in the curriculum of private schools or elsewhere.
A 2014 UK Labour and Skills Commission study found that 17 per cent of employers' difficulties in finding suitable candidates for jobs were due to insufficient language skills.
Thus, language skills are becoming a requirement to prepare young people for their future careers.
While many jobs require language, this knowledge is essential in a world that has become urban.
Regardless of the career path that one takes, learning a second language gives one a real chance to acquire the same lifelong knowledge as now.
Being able to communicate directly with other people in foreign countries immediately puts the person in a better position to know others than their competitors in the marketplace.
According to a YouGov survey of over 4,000 adults in the UK in 2013, 75 per cent cannot speak a foreign language fluently enough to communicate, while French is the only language spoken by over 10 per cent, 15 per cent.
That is why investing in language education is now important for today's children.
Multilingualism, particularly in developing countries, increases the chances of children finding meaningful employment.
In Scotland, each school differs in language.
Most schools will focus on current languages, while others will teach languages that are considered to be essential in the UK in terms of 2020, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child's interests, there are always languages to choose from in private schools, where the teachers are experts in the subject.
Independent schools in Scotland are committed to educating children in a way that prepares them and gives them the skills they need to succeed, whatever the future may hold.
It cannot be denied that today, in international business, languages remain a key factor for the future of a country, and therefore should be reflected in education.
Yes, modern languages should be seen as "knowledge that facilitates international communication".
Independent schools continue to offer these options, different options and inaccessible to young people in Scotland.
It is good that we do.
John Edward is the Chief Executive of the Independent Schools Council of Scotland
On Sunday, LeBron will play his first game for the Lakers in San Diego.
The wait is almost over as fans look forward to LeBron James making his debut for the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton announced that James will play in Sunday's preseason game against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But the number of minutes he would play was not confirmed.
"It will be over 48 minutes", Walton said on the Lakers' official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James will play the remaining minutes.
After practice earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers' six preseason schedule.
"I don't need to play pre-season games at this level of my career to prepare myself".
When Trump's campaign in West Virginia, on YouTube channel
President Donald Trump ran in a storm this evening in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It is the first of five Trump campaign events scheduled for next week, including a rally in popular locations including Tennessee and Mississippi.
While a confirmation vote has not been held on his nominee for Supreme Court Chief Justice, Trump is aiming to seek support in the upcoming midterm elections since Republicans risk losing control of Congress when the election is in November.
When is Trump's West Virginia campaign tonight and how will it be viewed online?
Trump's campaign in Wheeling, West Virginia is scheduled for 7 a.m. ET, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump's campaign in West Virginia online via a private link on YouTube.
Trump is likely to speak at this week's hearing of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, which has been heightened by allegations of sexual misconduct after the Senate vote to confirm him was postponed due to an FBI investigation.
But the primary focus of the campaign is to help Republicans cope with the November general election so that it can remain powerful.
Thus, Trump's campaign officials said the five campaigns next week are aimed at "empowering volunteers and activists as Republicans try to protect and win their majority in both the Senate and the House", according to Reuters.
A Trump campaign spokesperson told Reuters: "Control of Congress is a key element of his agenda so the president will travel to as many states as possible as we move into a busy campaign season".
The campaign, which is scheduled to take place at the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, could draw activists from "Ohio and Pennsylvania and be covered by Pittsburgh newspapers", according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday will be Trump's second visit in a month to West Virginia, a state that won the 2016 election by more than 40 votes.
Trump is trying to help the Republican West Virginia Senate candidate Patrick Morrisey, who is in the back of the vote.
Simon Haeder, a political scientist at West Virginia University, told Reuters: "It's not a good sign for Morrissey that the president has to come to help him get more votes".
2018 Ryder Cup: Team USA shows strength to maintain its confidence in Sunday's games
After a season, the Saturday afternoon golf tournament may be just what Ryder needed.
Fortunately, a more sophisticated concept has been developed but it is one that is more trusted and less aggressive than competing products like this.
So where is the power?
Jordan Spieth, who was walking in the afternoon, said: "They were six points ahead and now they are four, so I think we are going to show strength".
Europe is of course in luck, leading by four points with twelve games to play.
Americans, as Spieth puts it, feel like they have a lot of wind to blow their ships and a lot to cheer up on, at least not in the case of Spieth and Justin Thomas who have been playing all day and each gets three points out of four.
Spieth has been a prolific scorer from the point of view of the ball and has been exemplary.
The crowd and the noise were heightened when he hit a hole-in-one, scoring the crucial points to tie the game as he and Thomas were two points behind two games later.
His game-winning goal in the 15th minute also received a cheering cheer, a measure of how much he believed the U.S. team was missing.
"You have to get into the roots and worry about your own game", Spieth says.
That is the fate of each of these players.
18 holes for the ball.
The only players to score more than Spieth and Thomas in the two days were Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, who are the most decorated players in the Ryder Cup.
The European champions are there but they can probably win four out of four games and nothing goes wrong.
"Moliwood" was the only one of the two that did not score on Saturday afternoon, but refused to throw the hole on Saturday morning, Friday evening and in the second half of the eighteenth hole game on Friday morning.
The play and the way they moved their energy into and out of the remaining group ensured that they were the players to face on Sunday and there may be more players who are more popular for European victory in the sunset than Le Golf National Fleetwood or Molinari.
Ideally, both can be done on separate holes.
Talking about European victory would be premature.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson worked for Sergio Garcia, the football hero of the morning, when he was paired with Alex Noren.
The Spanish and Swedish players both hit the ball but never made it to the net.
On Sundays, there is no one to help you get the ball out of the basket.
Four-player golf is interesting to watch from a closer perspective because of the interaction between the two players involved, the advice they give, the advice they don't give, and the way the strategy can change in the blink of an eye.
Europe has played well as a team so far and led by enough points on the final day but this four-player game also showed that the US team has the strength to defend points; in particular, against the increasingly questionable states.
Europe leads 10-6 on the final day of the Ryder Cup
Europe has a good chance on the final day of the Ryder Cup after showing up Saturday in a four-ball game where they led 10-6 to beat the United States.
The best players Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the way by beating two-time challenger Tiger Woods to claim the Le Golf National title by four points.
Thomas Bjorn's European side, the defending champions who lost to Hazeltine two years later, defeated the underdog US side in the morning's four-ball draw, winning 3-1.
The USA defended their title in four games, winning two, but that didn't stop them from losing.
Jim Furyk's side needed eight points in Sunday's 12-ball draw to retain the trophy.
Fleetwood became the first European rookie to score four consecutive points while he and Molinari were given the nickname "Molliwood" after a successful week where they were the only two players to score four points in the first four games in the history of the Ryder Cup.
His victory over Woods and Patrick Reed in the fourth round was a good result for the team, as they defeated the unstable Woods and rookie Bryson Dechambeau by over 5&4.
Woods, who played two games on Saturday, showed a high level of performance but has now lost 19 of 29 games in four-ball and four-player and seven-player matches in a row.
Justin Rose, who did not play in the morning's four-ball draw, was reunited with teammate Henrik Stenson in the fourth round when they lost 2&1 to Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, respectively ranked No. 1 and No. 3 in the world.
Europe was not playing as it had always played, it was a windy day coming from the south-west of Paris.
Three-time major champions Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas were tied for the Americans' two-point lead on Saturday.
They won 2&1 over the Spaniards Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the four-ball draw and came back to beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4&3 in the fourth round after losing the first two holes.
Twice in the history of the Ryder Cup, a four-point loss to the winner of the match resulted in a one-on-one match, although Furyk's title holders needed only a draw to retain the trophy.
After being a good pair for two days, but now on Sunday the match will be a revenge even if it will be too much.
North Korea says 'no way' to de-nuclearize one country without reassurance
On Saturday, North Korea's foreign minister told the United Nations that continued sanctions only deepened mistrust in the United States and that there was no way the country could abandon its nuclear weapons program in the face of such a situation.
Ri Yong Ho told state officials at the annual General Assembly that "reasonable measures" were taken last year, such as halting nuclear testing, destroying nuclear test sites and ensuring that nuclear weapons and nuclear technology are no longer developed.
"However, we do not see the appropriate response from the US".
"There is no confidence in the United States that there will be confidence in the security of our countries and if there is no such confidence, there is no way that we as one country can stop the development of nuclear weapons first".
While Ri reiterated North Korea's usual allegations of Washington's "process" of denuclearization in which North Korea could control the price of the move, his comments seem valid, although he did not deny that Pyongyang could be denuclearizing as it has done in the past.
Ri cited the comments made by both presidents Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump during the first joint meeting between the US and North Korean presidents in Singapore on June 12, when Kim promised to work to "stop the nuclear missile buildup on the Korean peninsula" while Trump promised to protect North Korea's security.
North Korea wanted a known end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States insisted that Pyongyang first stop developing nuclear weapons.
Washington refused to accept the relaxation of the tough international sanctions against North Korea.
It states: "The United States continues to insist on a 'first nuclear halt' and to increase the level of sanctions to achieve its goal by force, despite the denial of a 'declaration of war's end.'"
"The idea that punishment can bring us to our knees is a pipe dream for a society that ignores us.
But the problem is that the continuing sanctions have increased our confidence in them".
Ri did not announce the plans for a second Kim-Trump summit, which the US president reiterated at a UN meeting earlier this week.
Instead, the ministry cited three meetings between Kim and South Korean President Moon Jae-in in the past five months and said: "If the country that was facing the issue of denuclearization was South Korea and not the United States, the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not have stopped".
And Ri's tone was strikingly different from the next year, when he spoke at the UN General Assembly, arguing that a nuclear test of the United States with Korean missiles was possible after Trump called Kim a "suicide bomber".
This year at the United Nations, Trump, who last year threatened to "totally destroy" North Korea, praised Kim for his willingness to take steps to stop the nuclear weapons program, but said more needed to be done and sanctions were maintained until North Korea stopped the nuclear weapons program.
On Wednesday, Trump said he did not have time to do so, saying "It could take two years, three years, three months; it doesn't matter".
China and Russia are arguing with the UN Security Council that it should reward Pyongyang for its actions.
However, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the Security Council on Thursday that "the intensification of the Security Council sanctions must continue in a robust and unwavering manner until it is demonstrated that the nuclear weapons have been thoroughly disarmed, cleared and evaluated".
The Security Council unanimously extended sanctions on North Korea since 2006 to prevent the government from supporting Pyongyang's nuclear and missile programs.
Pompeo met with Ri at a side meeting during the UN General Assembly and later said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his most recent visit was unsuccessful.
He left Pyongyang in July claiming that a move had been made, which was later reversed by North Korea, which declared that "the demands are like a gang of bandits".
North Korea expressed confidence at the Moon meeting that it would destroy missile and nuclear facilities this month if the United States "takes similar action".
He said Kim told him that he wanted "similar measures" to be taken to ensure security under Trump's Singapore pledge and to continue to improve relations with Washington.
Harvard students learn about rest
A new study from Harvard University this year gave all undergraduates more sleep to counter the growing male-dominated practice of caffeinated study and 'all-night' study.
A university worker has found that top students at a university often lack basic information about how to take care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and an expert at Brigham and Women's Hospital, developed a study, which he believes is the first of its kind in the United States.
He came up with the idea of starting the class after giving a talk on the effects of sleep deprivation on learning.
'After the talk, a girl came up to me and said, 'Why should you tell me this now, I'm a senior in college?'
'No one has ever told him about the importance of sleep, which surprised me,' he told The Telegraph.
The lesson, which was first offered, explains to students the basics of how good sleep helps students and athletes to behave better, and improves overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and the university's chief medical officer, said the university decided to bring the study in after students had not slept for a week.
The one-hour lesson includes a variety of communication assignments.
In one episode there is a picture of a bedroom where students are shown coffee mugs, curtains, sneakers and books and told that the effects of caffeine and alcohol are that performance is affected by poor sleep and the importance of a good sleep routine.
In another section, participants were told that prolonged sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart disease, stroke, depression and cancer.
The university card, with its information graphics, encourages participants to think about their routine.
'We know that it does not change students' behaviour immediately.
"But we believe they have a right to know; just as you have a right to know the health effects of your choice to smoke", says Professor Czeisler.
"There is still a trend towards 'night' learning", he added, adding that modern technology and the increasing pressure on students mean that sleep deprivation is a growing problem.
"Ensuring adequate, adequate sleep should be the 'secret weapon' for students to combat stress, fatigue and stress; and prevent weight gain, as lack of sleep puts the brain in a starvation mode, causing it to remain hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old California student studying mathematics and biochemistry, helped Professor Czeisler prepare the course, as he had taken his course the previous year in his first year at Harvard.
He said that the subject opened his eyes and made him want to teach it at any university.
He believes that the next step is to require graduates to complete certain programs before entering the job market.
Professor Czeisler advises that students should consider setting bedtime and wake time limits when they are aware of risk factors such as blue light from the screen, electronics, and LED lights, which can cause sleep disturbance and sleep problems.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: Menga's goal stunned Gerrard's coaching staff
Rangers were again caught in the eye with Dolly Menga's goal beating Steven Gerrard's team 1-0 at Livingston.
Ibrox looked set to win their first title since a 4-1 defeat to St Johnstone in February, but Gary Holt's side beat Gerrard for the second time in 18 games as manager to leave his side behind on points in the Ladbrokes Championship behind Hearts.
Menga scored seven minutes before half time as the Rangers were left with no way to pay for it.
While Rangers have now dropped to sixth, Livingston have moved up to third and are behind Hibernian on goal difference.
And there may be more problems ahead for the Rangers after the sideline referee, Calum Spence, was treated for a head injury after an apparent long-range hit.
Gerrard made eight substitute appearances in his team's victory over Ayr to advance to the semi-finals of the Red Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, took 11 Livi players off Hearts last week and was delighted his team beat their opponents throughout the game.
Rangers may be the most exclusive ball but Livingston has produced the fewest balls they have ever seen.
They won within minutes when Menga's first ball, a Scott Pittman, went to Allan McGregor's guard, but the attacking midfielder had a chance to throw the ball out.
The opening ball was kicked into the goal by Keaghan Jacobs for the goalkeeper, Craig Halkett, but defender Alan Lithgow made the ball go out of the goal.
Rangers took the lead but it looked like they should have more to do than be confident given how they played in the quarter-finals.
Alfredo Morelos no doubt felt he should have been awarded a penalty in the 75th minute when he and Steven Lawless were tied but the referee, Steven Thomson, refused to take the Colombian's approach seriously.
Rangers managed to score just two shots on goal in the first half but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly was not disappointed by Lassana Coulibaly's goal and Ovie Ejaria's unmatched shot.
While Livi's first goal in the 34th minute may have come from the attacking midfield, no one can deny that it was not to be scored as planned.
Again, the Rangers failed to recover the safety ball from Jacobs.
Scott Arfield did not touch the ball thrown by Declan Gallagher and passed it to Scott Robinson, who did not intervene to stop the ball from being easily passed to Menga.
Gerrard made a breakthrough by switching from Coulibaly to Ryan Kent, which was to have immediate effect when the forward was handed the ball to Morelos but Kelly ran well and stopped the ball.
But Livingston continued to resist the team he had invited to play regular football, with Lithgow and Halkett consistently hitting long balls.
Holt's side scored another goal in the final minute but McGregor stood up to stop Jacobs from scoring as Lithgow threw the ball out of bounds.
Rangers replaced Glenn Middleton who later suggested a penalty in the match against Jacobs but again referee Thomson ignored it.
Almanac: The Inventor of the Geiger Counter
Even our own page in the "Sunday Morning" Almanac: September 30, 1882, 136 days ago today and we are still living... the day the future genius Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring the release of synthetic chemical particles, which led to the development of the Geiger Counter.
The instrument has since become a scientific reference, and the Geiger Counter has been used in entertainment, such as in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado", starring Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: "What is that?"
Rogers: "It's a Geiger Counter, which is used to detect minerals containing particles like iranium.
If you give me these electrodes, you can clearly see the changes in the atoms released by the chemical particles in the gemstone".
Evans: "They are, in a sense, starting to bounce!"
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the metal he invented, which bears his name, still exists.
New cancer vaccine may teach the immune system to 'see' bad stem cells
New cancer vaccine may teach the immune system to 'find' bad cells and kill them
A vaccine that trains the body's immune system to detect harmful stem cells as part of a treatment regimen
The technique involves extracting the cells that make up the body's immune system and converting them into cells in the laboratory
They can then "find" the protein that is common in many cancers and re-inject it into the body
A vaccine under development is showing promising results in patients with a variety of cancers.
One woman was treated with a vaccine that trains the immune system to detect malignant cells, which cured her prostate cancer after 18 months.
The method involves extracting stem cells from a patient, converting them into a laboratory to "find" a protein called HER2 that is found in many cancers, and then replanting the stem cells into the body.
"Our results suggest that we have a very promising vaccine", said Professor Jay Berzofsky, of the US National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland.
Professor Berzofsky explains that HER2 "promotes the growth of many types of cancer", including breast, ovarian, lung and colon cancers.
One method of growing immune cells from a patient and "training" these cells to target cancer stem cells has been used to treat leukemia.
Kanye West made a complimentary statement to Trump supporters, wearing a hat with MAGA on it, after appearing on SNL.
It Did Not Work
Kanye West was the subject of a studio outcry on Saturday Night Live after a low-key song he sang praising US President Donald Trump and vowed to run in the 2020 presidential election.
After singing her third song of the night, she called Ghost Town where she was wearing a Make America Great hat, and fired at Democrats and repeated her support for Trump.
"Too often I talk about white people, they say, 'How can you like Trump and not be racist?'
"I mean, if I was concerned about race, I would have left America a long time ago".
The SNL show began with a humorous critique of Hollywood actor Matt Damon's testimony to Brett Kavanaugh before the Senate Judiciary Committee took action on a complaint by Christine Blasey Ford about sexual harassment.
Although not reported in the press, footage of West's remarks was posted online by comedian Chris Rock.
It is unclear whether Rock intended to criticize West based on his postings.
And West complained that the audience had made too many comments behind the podium about his hat.
"I was pushed from the podium.
They said, 'Don't go on the podium with that hat on.'
They beat me to it!
"They said I was nowhere", according to the Washington Examiner.
West goes on to say, "You want to see that I'm not relevant?" He says, "Put on a champagne hat, because it means you don't tell me what to do.
Try to love one another".
His remarks prompted at least two protests from the audience and the SNL audience, which appeared to be humiliated, according to Variety, with one person telling the newspaper: "The whole studio is in shambles".
West was last seen as the replacement for singer Ariana Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days earlier.
West made a big impression on the singer with his song I Love it, in which he wore a Perrier hat.
West was supported by the president of the conservative TPUSA group, Candace Turner, who tweeted: "One of the most enthusiastic people: You have done a great job of fighting the revolutionaries".
But host Karen Hunter tweeted that West is "showcasing who he really is and it's great".
"But I chose NOT to pay this person (I buy his music or clothes to promote his "art") believing that he is receiving and spreading ideas that are harmful to the people of my community.
He got out.
She added: "We too have been delivered".
Before the concert, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name, saying that he is now "formerly known as Kanye West".
He was not the first artist to change his name, and he followed in the footsteps of others such as Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
His fellow rapper Snoop Dogg used the name Snoop Lion and the late Prince, who changed his name to Prince, used the same name.
Accused of attempted murder by stabbing in Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder following a stabbing at a restaurant in east Belfast on Friday.
The incident occurred in Ballyhackamore, according to police.
The accused is expected to appear before the Belfast High Court on Monday.
The charges against him will be investigated by the Prosecutor's Office.
Game of Thrones actor Kit Harington has denounced the culture of the tribe
Kit Harington is known for playing the swordsman Jon Snow in the fantasy-themed HBO series Game of Thrones.
But the 31-year-old actor has condemned discrimination against the male hero, saying his acting means that teenagers often feel they have to be strong to be respected.
Speaking to The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said she believed 'something was wrong' and wondered how she could address the issue of male stereotypes in the wake of the #Me movement.
Kit, who recently married Game of Thrones co-star Rose Leslie, also 31, admitted that he feels 'too strong' about solving the problem.
And I said, My soul is troubled, and I am in anguish: where do these wicked deeds of men come from?
'How do we educate men when they grow up about the problems we face today?'
Kit believes that television may be a contributing factor to the rise of male stereotypes due to the over-representation of male stereotypes by film actors.
He continued: 'What is man born for, or what is the gift of man?
What is taught on television and on the street, making teenagers feel that they have a certain part that makes them men?
I think that's the big question of our time: How do we change that?
Because something is clearly wrong with our youth.'
In an interview, he also admitted that he would not be able to star in the prequel or sequel series to Game of Thrones when the series ends this summer, saying he no longer wanted to 'fight and ride'.
From November Kit will star in Sam Shepard's newest addition to the franchise, True West, a story about a filmmaker and his brother who steals his movie.
The actor recently announced that he thinks meeting his wife, Rose, is the best thing to come out of the Game of Thrones series.
He said, 'I met my wife while we were doing a series, so it gave me my future family and my new life from then on.'
Rose played Ygritte, the favorite of Kit and Jon Snow, in the Emmy-winning comedy-drama series.
They married in June 2018 at the Leslie family estate in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports a 14% increase in new infections
China reported a 14% increase in HIV and AIDS cases.
More than 820,000 people have been infected in the country, according to health officials.
Nearly 40,000 new cases were reported in the second half of 2018 alone.
A high number of new infections have been linked to non-group contact, which is in contrast to previous days.
HIV infection is usually spread rapidly in some parts of China due to contaminated blood donation.
But the number of people infected with HIV in this way has dropped to almost zero, Chinese health officials announced at a conference in Yunnan province.
Yet, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China is increasing by 100,000 people every year.
HIV infection through sexual intercourse is a major problem for gay sex workers in China.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against homosexuals is on the rise.
With the country following traditional values, studies estimate that 70-90% of men who have sex with other men end up marrying women.
Most cases of HIV infection occur during non-group sex without adequate precautions in the relationship.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised the widespread availability of HIV vaccines as part of the response.
Maxine Waters denied that Republican senators' information was released by one of the staff, denouncing "problematic lies" and "conspiracy".
U.S. Rep. Maxine Waters on Saturday denied allegations that one of her employees had leaked the personal information of Republican senators on Wikipedia's lawyer pages.
A Los Angeles Democrat said the numbers are being challenged by the "very Republican" lobbyists.
Waters said in a statement on Twitter that it was: "Fake, fake, ugly fake".
The information reportedly included the home addresses and phone numbers of U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both of Utah.
The news, which surfaced online Thursday, was reported by an anonymous source on Capitol Hill during a Senate hearing on sexual misconduct allegations against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
The news came after three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
Hill reports: Conservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState have reported that the IP address indicating the source of the post is associated with Waters' office and has reported information from one of Waters' employees.
"These allegations are baseless and not true at all", he adds, "but they are just plain lies".
"One of my employees, whose identity, privacy and security were compromised due to fraudulent and false allegations; he had no role in releasing this information.
These accusations are baseless and untrue, but they are outright lies".
Waters' comments prompted strong online criticism, including from former White House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer.
"This denial is outrageous", says Fleischer.
"It shows that he has no desire to be a member of Congress.
When someone is accused of something he did not do, he should not get angry.
He should not refuse to let the management do its job.
I should not be asked what the accuser has against him.
He needs to calm down and relax".
Fleischer was forced to compare Waters's response to the charges to the fact that Democrats criticized Judge Kavanaugh, who was also accused by critics of seemingly being angry at Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, the Republican candidate vying to remove Waters from the midterm elections, also expressed his views on Twitter.
"It would be great if it were true", he tweeted.
In a statement, Waters said his office had notified "competent authorities and law enforcement agencies that they are looking into what he claims is fraud.
"We will make sure that those who did this are found", he continues, "and they will be held accountable by law for any acts of misconduct or misconduct committed by any employee who serves me".
Johnny English Strikes Again - Rowan Atkinson as a comedian
It is now common practice to see the effect of Britain's withdrawal from the European Union as a new film about the English and it seems likely that this new film in the series known as Johnny English will include action and comedy; it debuted in 2003 as Johnny English and was re-released in 2011 as Johnny English Reborn.
A comedy-drama film on a non-existent topic that will showcase our country's export opportunities?
At any rate, the grumpy, old, incompetent actor Johnny English was re-licensed for a second film, his most well-known being an extended comedy for non-English speaking audiences.
He plays a secret agent who learns how to be funny to portray the character of Mr. Clouseau, who becomes more like Mr. Bean when he plays the role of a far-fetched character, as at the 2012 London Olympics opening ceremony.
The original, based on the classic and iconic Atkinson who once starred in a Barclaycard TV commercial, may now be forgotten, leaving a lasting impression.
There were two good moments in the publication of JE.
I liked the way Johnny English approached the helicopter while wearing his 500th guardsman's uniform and the helicopter's sharp blade touching his helmet.
Atkinson's body-based comedy talent is highly visible, but her humor is seemingly weak and unusual in the context of the popularity of films such as 007 and Mission Impossible where the "know-what" actors themselves act out comedy as a complement.
The comedy seems more for young children than adults and Johnny English's eccentricity is less creative and more focused on Atkinson's films where he never speaks a word as Bean.
The main story was that Britain was in grave danger.
A hacker infiltrates a top British spy agency, exposing the profiles of all British spy agents operating in various locations, with a player shown in action but unfortunately given a small role as Kevin Eldon.
This was the real challenge for the proud and controversial prime minister, who is in the midst of a potential unpopular politician: Emma Thompson has a good role where she's going to be like Teresa-May but not much of a role.
His financial advisers tell him that the spy everywhere has been exposed, and that someone must retire.
And it means that no one but Johnny English, who at the time is a high school teacher, but he's teaching a non-curricular course on how to be a spy: That's good advice from English at Rock School about how to be a spy.
English is sent back to Whitehall for urgent instruction and reunites with his former colleague Bough, again played by Ben Miller.
Now, Bough is a hairdresser, married to a submarine commander, a position that is still held by Vicki Pepperdine but not as successful.
So it is Batman and Robin, playing the role of the Queen's Secret Service, who meet the harsh female agent for Olga Kurylenko, Ophelia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the new minister would fall for a tech billionaire who claims to be the solution to the UK's computer crisis: the unlucky Jason Volta, the time-waster Jake Lacy.
English began Bough's difficult journey of extreme disguise: They hired waiters, running a French restaurant; they caused a stir by trying to sneak into the expensive Volta cruise ship; and English wanted to take matters into his own hands when he tried to use real, untouchable batteries to practice inside Volta's house.
All of this is done in the final scene of the movie, but as exciting and as intense as it is, there is a children's TV that shows it all.
It is very common.
And so all the other Johnny English films are where I stop to think: Can't the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a good acting rival to showcase her talent?
Labour denies it is considering a four-day payday scheme for British workers
Jeremy Corbyn of the Labour Party is considering a major plan whereby all Britons will work four days a week, but be paid five days.
The party says it wants executives from various companies to look for ways to save money through the development of artificial intelligence (AI) for employees to get an extra day off.
It may leave workers enjoying a three-day weekend, but with the same pay as before.
The idea is 'fit' for the party's economic agenda and aims to change the situation for the benefit of the country's workers, sources say.
The four-day week was advocated by the Trade Union Congress as a way to make workers more productive in the face of economic change.
A senior Labour Party official told The Sunday Times: 'The strategic review is expected to be published before the end of the year.
'It is not a one-day event but working four days a week is a desirable and appropriate way of working for the sake of the workers and the industry as a whole.'
The Labour Party may not be the first to support the idea, with the environmental movement promising to introduce a four-day workweek in a broader campaign for the 2017 general election.
However, at the moment this demand is not supported by all Labour members.
A Labour spokesman said: 'Four-day working week is not a Labour initiative and will not be considered by the Labour Party.'
Deputy Chancellor John McDonnell used last week's Labour Party conference to outline his direction for socialist economic change.
Mr. McDonnell said he was determined to regain the power taken from "faceless" and "shrouded" leaders in the ranks of the water, gas and electric companies.
The vice chancellor's plans also suggest that partners in the water companies may not support his plan as a whole as the Labour government 'cut costs' based on the bad practices it has seen.
He also confirmed plans to put employees on the board of directors and set up an Inclusive Ownership Fund to give 10 per cent of the shares to independent companies, with the expectation that each could receive a profit share of up to Â£500.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy told "60 Minutes" if the FBI investigation of Kavanaugh could change their minds
The FBI investigation of the charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed the final confirmation vote for Supreme Court Chief Justice by a week, and questions whether the agency's findings could cause Republican senators to reconsider their support for him.
In an interview aired Sunday, "60 Minutes" anchor Scott Pelley asked Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could have any discovery that would change their minds.
Kennedy seemed more relaxed than his South Carolina counterpart.
Kennedy said, "Absolutely".
"I talked about going to trial, I said, I talked to Judge Kavanaugh.
And I called him after this, and said unto him, Behold, he is accused, and said, Thou hast done this.
He kept his word, was determined, and told the truth".
Graham's election, however, seemed to have been finalized.
"I have made a decision on Brett Kavanaugh and I want to take the case against him down".
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I do know this: Brett denied it outright", Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"And everyone who talks about it can't control it.
These are allegations from 36 years ago.
I don't see anything new that can change".
The Global Citizen Festival has even done something to reduce poverty?
On Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event featuring celebrity musicians with a compelling mission to end global poverty.
Now in its seventh year, the Global Citizen Festival draws thousands of people to Central Park's Great Lawn not only to enjoy the performances of iconic artists like Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to campaign for the true goal of the event - to end extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, launched in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international advocacy group that believes in the eradication of poverty and the effective reduction of poverty.
To receive a free ticket to the festival (unless you want to pay for a VIP ticket), attendees must do various activities or "activities" such as volunteering, emailing government officials, making phone calls or otherwise effectively assisting in their campaign for poverty alleviation.
But how is the Global Citizen campaign reaching its goal 12 years from now?
Is the idea of paying people to go to a free concert the right way to get people to call for action or is it just another form of "click campaigning" where people feel they can make a real difference by signing an online petition or posting a message on Twitter?
Since 2011, Global Citizen has reportedly documented some 19 million "actions" by its supporters, leading to a variety of goals.
The site says that these efforts have helped to inspire world leaders to announce $37 billion worth of policies and initiatives aimed at improving the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group made a total of 390 commitments with at least US$10 billion donated or raised.
The group estimates that the aid received so far has directly affected nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Among the initiatives included partnerships with The Power of Nutrition, a UK-based organization of entrepreneurs and policy makers committed to "helping children reach their full potential", pledging $35 million to help end malnutrition in the country after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from Global Citizens.
"With the help of the UK government, our donors, national governments and Global Citizens like you, we can end the social inequality that is history", The Power of Nutrition ambassador Tracey Ullman told the crowd at a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 campaigns calling for better maternal and child nutrition in the UK, the government announced that it would fund the Power of Nutrition initiative, which will reach 5 million women and children with nutrition assistance.
In response to one of the most frequently asked questions on its website, it asks: "What makes you think we can eradicate extreme poverty?"
Global citizen responded: "It will be a long and difficult journey; sometimes it involves falling and reaching the goal.
But, as the great human rights and anti-apartheid revolutions in South Africa preceded our actions, we will reach a milestone, because together we are stronger.
Artists including Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle MonÃ¡e are among the performers this year at the New York concert, which will be led by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The US may use warships to "lock in" and prevent Russian energy exports, according to the US Secretary of the Interior
Washington may "if necessary" decide to use its warships to block Russian gas from reaching various markets, including the Middle East, said Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke, as reported by the Washington Examiner.
Zinke accused Russia of interfering in the Syrian war, which was largely at the invitation of the legitimate government, but as an excuse to seek a new source of gas.
He is reported to have said: "I believe that the reason they are in the Middle East is because they want to have access to the gas market as they do in Eastern Europe, Southern Europe".
And, according to the authorities, there are ways and means to deal with it.
"The United States has the ability, with our warships, to ensure that the sea lanes are open and if necessary closed, to ensure that their gas does not reach the market".
Zinke was speaking at an event hosted by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit group that describes itself as "the voice of the gas consumer" in the United States.
He went on to compare Washington's approach to Russia and Iran, saying that there is no comparison between the two.
"The economic choice for Iran and Russia is, almost, energy and petroleum substitution", he said, referring to Russia as a "smooth horse" with an oil-based economy.
The comments came after the Trump administration plans to increase the volume of liquefied natural gas in Europe, replacing Russia, which is selling gas at a lower price to Europeans.
Thus, Trump administration officials, including US President Donald Trump himself, are trying to persuade Germany to withdraw from the "unsuccessful" Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which Trump says has made Berlin a "pledge" to Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly announced the $11 billion pipeline project, dubbed Nord Stream 2, which is expected to double the planned capacity of the pipeline to 110 billion cubic meters, with the sole purpose of being an economic project.
The Kremlin says Washington's total disapproval of the project is based primarily on economic considerations and is a good example of bias in the marketplace.
"I believe we share the view that gas cannot be a tool to shadow one side and that users should be able to choose their own solutions", said Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak, after a joint meeting with US Secretary of Energy Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The US position was not well received by Germany, which reiterated its support for the project.
The Federation of German Industries (BDI), Germany's largest industrial organization, has called for the United States to refrain from aggressive action in the European Union and the Berlin-Moscow agreement.
"I have a serious problem with third-party interference in our gas supply", said Dieter Kempf, the head of the Federation of German Industries (BDI), at a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will "carefully consider" running for president in 2020, says Massachusetts state senator
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that she should "think hard" about running for president after the midterm elections.
At a press conference in the lobby of Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that he was considering running.
According to The Hill, she said: "It is time for women to go to Washington and rebuild our fractured government with a woman in charge".
"After December 6, I will seriously consider running for president".
Warren referred to President Donald Trump in a public debate in the House of Representatives, calling him "steering the country in the wrong direction".
"I am deeply concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy".
Warren has returned to his strong criticism of Trump and his nominee for Supreme Court Chief Justice, Brett Kavanaugh.
"We really need the FBI to investigate before the election", Warren said on Twitter on Friday.
However, a poll released on Thursday showed that a majority of voters in Warren's riding do not think he should run in 2020.
Fifty-eight percent of "potential" voters in Massachusetts said a senator should not run, according to a survey by the Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe.
Thirty-two percent supported his candidacy.
The poll showed strong support from former Governor Deval Patrick, with 38 percent supporting his candidacy and 48 percent opposing it.
Other prominent Democrats who have been discussed as potential candidates for the 2020 election include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he may make a decision in January, the Associated Press reported.
Sarah Palin speaks about the depression Track Palin experienced during the Donald Trump campaign
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq before being placed on the September transfer list.
Arrested and charged with domestic violence Monday night
She told the audience at Donald Trump's campaign in Tulsa, Oklahoma: "What my son is going through, what he has been through, I can relate to is that other families are suffering the trauma and the trauma that our soldiers are returning".
Palin described her arrest as "a search for the wrong problem" and said that her son and other veterans "come back different, come back wounded, come back wondering if there is any honor given to fellow airmen and each soldier for their sacrifice".
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla, Alaska and charged with domestic violence and assault, obstructing the discussion of domestic violence and possession of a firearm while in possession of drugs, according to Dan Bennett, spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 states and D.C. support a new asylum initiative
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia supported lawsuits blocking new U.S. asylum measures for victims fleeing gang or domestic violence.
Representatives from 18 states and territories filed a brief for the court on Friday in Washington to halt the crackdown on asylum seekers, according to NBC News.
All names of the plaintiffs in favor of Grace v. Sessions claim that the complaint filed by the American Civil Liberties Union in August against the government's actions was never made public.
She said her boyfriend "and even her sons were gang members" who abused her but US authorities denied her asylum application on July 20.
He was imprisoned in Texas.
Advocates for Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which account for the largest number of asylum seekers in the United States, as countries with widespread gang violence and domestic violence.
New U.S. policies on asylum seekers reversed a 2014 decision by the Immigration Appeals Board that allowed undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence to seek asylum.
District of Columbia Chief Judge Karl Racine, in a statement Friday, said the new measures "disregard decades of state, national and international law".
"National law requires that all asylum claims be processed based on specific information and that the claim exists and the new measures are in place to exceed the standard", the briefing document from friends of the court said.
The judges insisted in the brief that immigration restrictions are detrimental to the U.S. economy, saying they are more likely to be entrepreneurial and "provide essential employment".
In June, Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges to stop providing asylum to victims of domestic and gang violence.
In his June 11 announcement on the measures, Sessions said: "Asylum is granted to those who leave their country of origin because they are vulnerable or fear that they may be discriminated against based on race, religion, nationality, or membership in a particular social group or political opinion".
Refugees are not meant to reduce the severity of problems; no matter how serious problems people face every day around the world.
Major relief efforts in Palu as death toll doubles in rapid search for casualties
For the survivors, the problems grew as the hours passed.
"I feel very bad", said Risa Kusuma, 35, a mother who was carrying her son with fever to the emergency room, angry at the city of Palu.
"Every minute, a rescue team comes with bodies.
Clean water is scarce".
The inhabitants who were found would return to their ruined homes, grab their flooded belongings, and try to find something still alive to use.
Hundreds were injured and hospitals damaged by the 7.5 magnitude quake were overwhelmed.
Several were injured, including Dwi Haris, who suffered a broken back and shoulder, lying outside the Palu Military Hospital, where patients were being treated outside due to continuing small earthquakes.
Tears filled his eyes as he recalled what happened when he heard a powerful earthquake that shook the fifth-floor hotel room where he was staying with his wife and child.
"We didn't have time to run.
I hate the wall murals, I think", Harris told the Associated Press, adding that his family was in the city where the wedding took place.
"I heard my wife scream for help, but then she became quiet.
I don't know what happened to her or my son.
I hope they are safe".
US ambassador accuses China of 'bending' the use of mobile advertising
A week after a Chinese newspaper published a four-page statement in the American daily newspaper boasting of a trade deal with the US, the US ambassador to China accused Beijing of using a US newspaper to spread propaganda.
On Wednesday, US President Donald Trump criticized the China Daily for paying a fee to Des Moines Register, Iowa's largest newspaper, after accusing China of trying to interfere in the US congressional elections on November 6, which China denies.
Trump's accusations of Beijing's attempted meddling in the US election reflect what US officials told Reuters was a new phase in a larger Washington-led effort to pressure China.
While it is common for foreign governments to place advertisements to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently engaged in a trade war that has escalated to the point of imposing tariffs on each other's imports.
China has also responded to the tariff war by targeting exporters in Iowa, which has helped Trump's Republican Party, according to experts on China-US relations.
Terry Branstad, the US ambassador to China and longtime governor of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural products to China, said Beijing's government is a threat to American farmers, ranchers and businessmen.
"China has now stepped up its complaints about non-interference and the placement of non-commercial advertisements in our independent newspapers", Branstad wrote in a commentary in the Des Moines Register on Sunday.
"In order to spread its propaganda, the Chinese government is taking advantage of the American tradition of free speech and the freedom of the press to publish paid advertisements in the Des Moines Register", Branstad said.
"In contrast, newspaper kiosks on the streets of Beijing are full of comments from people who are unhappy with the government's actions but do not get a true picture of the various ideas that the Chinese may be on a path to a troubled economy, because the media is being monitored by the ruling Communist Party of China", he wrote.
He added that "one of the major newspapers in China has refused to publish" his story, although he did not name the newspaper.
Analysts warned that Republicans would distance themselves from women voters just before the midterm elections with Kavanaugh Debacle.
While many Republican leaders are waiting and would support the proposed Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh, who is facing multiple sexual assault charges, a commentator warned that their actions would not be well received; particularly, on the women's side, during the midterm elections.
The emotions surrounding the issue are high and many Republicans have already expressed their desire to continue the election.
These things are irreversible", Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at Syracuse University's Maxwell School, told The Hill in a report published Saturday.
Reeher said he doubted that the last-minute announcement by Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Arizona) for an FBI investigation would be enough to quell the anger of angry voters.
"Women will never forget what happened yesterday; they will never forget tomorrow and they will never forget November", Karine Jean-Pierre, senior advisor and national spokesperson for the advocacy group MoveOn, said Friday, according to a Washington, D.C., newspaper report.
On Friday morning, protesters chanted "November is here!" as they marched through the Senate floor as Republicans in control of the Justice Committee voted to continue to confirm Kavanaugh's nomination despite some blunt remarks by Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, according to Mic.
Stu Rothenberg, a non-partisan political commentator, told the news website: "The Democratic Party and its agenda are at a high level".
"People would say it's high-end, and it's true.
But it can go even higher; in particular, among women who are not sure who they will vote for in the suburbs and young voters, aged 18 to 29, if they don't like the president, they often don't vote".
Although Ford made clear before he publicly testified about the sexual assault he was subjected to by the newly appointed chief justice, critics say it is unlikely to be well received as long as Republicans continue to push for confirmation.
"This has been a confusing experience for the Republican Party", Michael Steele, former executive director of the Republican National Committee, said in a news release earlier this week to NBC News.
"It's not about the committee vote or the general election or whether Kavanaugh gets impeached, it's about how Republicans are going to handle this and how they're going to handle it", Guy Cecil, executive director of Priorities USA, a Democratic nominating group, told a news conference.
However, Americans seem divided about who to believe after the Ford-Kavanaugh testimony, with many leaning toward the latter's testimony.
A new survey by YouGov shows that 41 percent of respondents strongly believe or may believe Ford's testimony, while 35 percent said they strongly believe or may believe Kavanaugh's testimony.
And 38 percent said they thought Kavanaugh may or may not have lied in his testimony, while 30 percent said the same about Ford.
Following Flake's call for action, the FBI is currently investigating allegations made by Ford and at least one other accuser, Deborah Ramirez, according to The Guardian.
Ford testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee on a sworn affidavit last week that Kavanaugh had been drunk and had outlived him by 17 years.
Ramirez accuses the future Supreme Court justice of showing him his manhood while attending a party while he was a student at Yale in the 1980s.
The creator of the World Wide Web plans to launch a new web to compete with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, is about to launch a company that will compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest tech giant, Inrupt, is a company based on Berners-Lee's open-source platform Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and who is allowed access to that data.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that Inrupt's goal is to "conquer the world".
Speaking about the company he is starting, he said, "We have to do it now".
"It is time to remember".
The software uses Solid technology to allow users to set up a "personal online database" or POD.
It may include a list of contacts, a to-do list, a calendar, a music library and other personal and professional resources.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify all running in the same browser at the same time.
The unique feature of this private online database is that it is entirely user-driven.
The company calls it "information empowerment".
Inrupt's vision, according to CEO John Bruce, is that the company should bring the right capabilities, practices and knowledge to help make Solid accessible to everyone.
Currently, the company consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform introduced by IBM, some of the software developers who have been contracted to work on various projects, and a volunteer code-writing organization.
Starting this week, developers around the world can download applications that use the networking tools available on Inrupt.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team would not be discussing with "Facebook and Google whether or not to initiate changes to their business model that could be completed as soon as possible.
"We are not asking for a new one".
In a statement on Medium released on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt's "purpose is to provide the business and networking capabilities to help protect the integrity and integrity of the new platform built using Solid".
In 1994, Berners-Lee revolutionized the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been a revolutionary voice in the debate over the Internet.
Even after he founded Inrupt, Berners-Lee will continue to serve as the Founder and CEO of the World Wide Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I am very optimistic about the future of the global market", Berners-Lee said.
Bernard Vann: Victoria Cross recipient of WW1 held in celebration
A Church of England clergyman who was awarded the Victoria Cross in World War I as a war hero was given a commemoration in the town 100 years later.
Lieutenant Colonel Revera Bernard Vann was awarded the medal on 29 September 1918 in the Battle of Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
However, he was killed by a sniper four days later and never realized that he had won the British Army's highest decoration.
On Saturday, a memorial stone was raised by his two grandchildren at a ceremony in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Vann, described it as a "beautiful monument" to have a well-lit stone 100 years after the battle that won his grandfather his first major medal.
According to the London Gazette, 29 September 1918; Lieutenant Colonel Vann led his battalion through the Saint-Quentin "through a fierce cloud and a barrage of ground and machine gun fire".
He then rushed to the battlefield and with "great courage" led his troops to the front and held off the enemy until he himself managed to take down three opposing armies.
Lieutenant Colonel was killed by a German sniper on 4 October 1918, less than a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said that his grandfather's work was "something I know I could never do because it makes him humble".
He and his brother, Dr James Vann, also laid flowers at the cemetery after the funeral, which was led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
"I feel very proud to have been a part of this journey", said Michael Vann, adding that "the true heroic power is demonstrated by the support of so many people".
Fans of MMA have been up all night waiting for Bellator 206, instead of the popular Peppa Pig series.
Imagine, you stayed up all night to watch the Bellator 206 boxing match and then missed the much-anticipated fight.
The San Jose schedule included 13 matches, including six highly anticipated matches that were broadcast overnight in the UK on Channel 5.
At 6am, when Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were ready to meet, British television viewers were stunned to see the pig turned into the legendary Peppa Pig.
Some were not happy with what happened afterwards as they stayed up all night until the early hours of the morning mostly waiting for the fight.
One Twitter fan described the change to show the children's attacks as "a ridiculously unreasonable joke".
"It was a state policy that the 6:00 a.m. show was inappropriate when they changed it to include children's programs", said Dave Schwartz, Bellator's Vice President of Communications and Communications, when asked about the video.
"Peppa the pig, yes".
Bellator CEO Scott Coker said they would be making changes to their schedule including UK viewers in the coming days.
"I think when I think about seeing the fight over", Coker said, "I think maybe they can do something about it".
"But it's six o'clock on a Sunday morning when I go and we can't change it until it's Sunday at our time, which is Monday at their time.
But we are going to do something about it.
Trust me, when I was translating the script, there were a lot of posts coming back and not all of them were good news.
We were trying to fix it, thinking it was a technical problem.
But no, it was a government matter.
I promise you that tomorrow will never happen again.
We'll cut it down to five fights instead of six; as we always do and we tried to give our fans more and we got through.
It was a tragedy".
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley feels 'humiliated' about his sexuality
Olympic diver Tom Daley said he grew up feeling humiliated by everyone because of his sexual orientation, but it motivated him to achieve.
The 24-year-old said she didn't realize it until she went to high school and realized that "everyone is not like me".
Speaking for the first time on Radio 4's Desert Island Discs program hosted by Lauren Laverne, she said she spoke about gay rights to give others "hope".
She also said that being a mother had made her less interested in winning Olympic medals.
Longtime host Kirsty Young had taken several months off due to illness.
Appearing as a teenager in Laverne's first interview, Daley said she felt "below" everyone else because "it wasn't allowed in the family to love boys and girls".
"To this day", she says, "this feeling of inferiority and being different has been a great source of strength and energy for me to achieve".
He wanted to show that he was "something", so that no one would be disappointed when he learned about his sexuality.
The two-time Olympic bronze medalist became a prominent gay activist and used participation in the English-speaking and British-colonial Commonwealth Games in Australia to urge several countries to stop criminalizing homosexuality.
He said he put it out because he felt lucky to be able to live freely without regrets and wanted to give others "optimism".
The three-time world champion said dating American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom she met in 2013, "surprised me".
Daley married the Oscar winner, 20 years her senior, last year but says the age gap has never been an issue.
"You're young when you've been through a lot", she said, noting that she attended her first Olympics at age 14 and that her biological father died of cancer three days later, saying it was hard to find someone her age to experience her.
The couple became parents in June, giving birth to a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said "all of my thoughts" changed.
"If you asked me last year what I wanted most, I would say, 'I want to win a gold medal.'
"You know, there are things more important than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic medal is Robbie".
Her son was named after his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said his father never believed he was dying and that his last request was for their tickets to the 2012 London Olympics; he wanted them to sit in the front seats.
"I couldn't tell him, 'Dad, you're not going to be able to sit in the front seats.'"
"I was holding his hands when he died and it was only after he breathed his last breath that I accepted that he was dead and I was sure that he was not a martyr".
The following year Daley competed in the 2012 Olympics and won a bronze medal.
"I knew this was what I had dreamed of all my life, to perform in front of my country's fans at the Olympics, and there was no greater pain than that".
It also inspired her first hit, Proud by Heather Small, which has been performed everywhere she prepares for the Olympics and has sparked her excitement.
Desert Island Discs will air on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15am UK time.
Retired player Mickelson was named a reserve for Saturday's Ryder Cup
American Phil Mickelson will break the record on Sunday with his 47th Ryder Cup appearance, but it will take a little more of his own playing to avoid a failure.
Mickelson, playing in his 12th bi-annual game, was named a replacement by captain Jim Furyk in Saturday's four-ball game against the same players.
Instead of doing the basic tasks as he often does in America, the five-time major champion splits his day between sitting on the bench and working on his routine to correct what's wrong.
He is not playing very well and despite reaching the peak of his career, the 48-year-old is not in good physical condition to play in Le Golf National, where players who don't hit the ball well are likely to miss out.
And if the performance alone is not enough, Mickelson, in Sunday's ninth round, meets British Open winner Francesco Molinari, who played rookie Tommy Fleetwood to win all four of their matches this week.
If the Americans, who have not scored four points after 12 games apiece, start the tournament strong, Mickelson's game may be a very important one.
Furyk expressed confidence in the man, although he could not say much more.
"He understood his role today, he hugged me and put his hand on my shoulder and told me he was ready for tomorrow", says Furyk.
"He is very confident.
He is one of the greatest players and has made a great contribution to these teams in the past days and this week.
I never thought he could play two games.
I had seen more, but the way it happened and the way we thought it would happen.
He wants to play like everyone else".
Mickelson will break Nick Faldo's record for most Ryder Cup appearances on Sunday.
It may be the end of his Ryder Cup career that has not matched his personal best.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven draws, although Furyk said his presence makes the team valuable.
"He is funny, sarcastic, intelligent, and a good man to have on a team", she explains.
"I think the young players enjoyed being with him, and it was a good week to see it in person.
He gives more than he plays".
European captain Thomas Bjorn knows his lead and most points could be lost soon
Thomas Bjorn, captain of Europe, knows that leading by the most points to the final day of a single-player Ryder Cup tournament can easily turn bad.
The Dane's 1997 debut at Valderrama, captained by Seve Ballesteros, was five points ahead of the Americans, but they finished just a few points ahead, winning 141â2-131â2.
"You keep in mind that we were leading by many points in Valderrama; we were leading in Brookline, where he lost and in Valderrama, where he won, but that's all", said Bjorn, pictured, after watching the 2018 champions win 5-3 in Friday's game and 10-6 in Le Golf National yesterday.
So, history will show me and the rest of the team that it's not over.
But you will be working hard tomorrow.
Go out and do only good things.
It wasn't over until you saw the score written on the board.
We also have a goal to try and win this trophy, which is our focus.
I've said it before, I can focus on the 12 players on our side, but we know what's ahead of us on the other side; the world's top players".
Bjorn goes on to say that he is happy that my players played on a difficult golf course: "I can't get ahead of myself in these tournaments.
Tomorrow is even more important.
Tomorrow is a personal act that must be demonstrated and the difference in what we should do.
It's good to be with the other player when things are going well, but when you're playing by yourself, then you're trying your best as a golfer.
This is the final message for the players, which is aimed at making them give their best tomorrow.
Now leave that which is yours and go and reap for yourself and for yourself".
Unlike Bjorn, the different number and outfit worn by Jim Furyk will determine how his players behave to play better individually than they did with their teammates, most notably Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who scored three points out of four.
Furyk himself was on both ends of the final day of the competition, where he was part of the team that won at Brookline before losing when Europe withdrew from the "Miracle at Medinah" competition.
"I remember how every word made it", he said when asked how Ben Crenshaw, the 1999 team captain, handled the players until the final day.
"We have 12 important matches tomorrow, but you have to start fast like you saw in Brooklyn, like you saw in Medina.
If the forces are directed in one direction, they put pressure on the midfielders.
We put the players in the game and release the players in the right way and we feel like we're going to like it, you know, we're going to try to do miracles tomorrow".
Thomas was tasked with trying to lead the team to a playoff spot and face Rory McIlroy in the championship game, along with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter and other Europeans in the opening round of the tournament.
Bjorn says about the selection of single-player games: "I took this team to the next level because I think it has all the players that will be helped".
New German battleship turns the clock again
The new German battleship was authorized for commissioning in 2014 to replace older Cold War-era ships, but would not be available until at least next year due to poor system performance and high prices, according to local media.
The granting of the right of passage to the "Rheinland-Pfalz", the lead ship of the new Baden-Wuerttemberg class, was postponed until early 2019, according to Die Zeit newspaper quoting a military spokesman.
The ship was replaced by a new warship in 2014, but problems with shipping have put the project in a precarious position.
The Baden-Wuerttemberg class is a class of four ships ordered by the German Navy in 2007 to replace the aging Bremen class.
It must, of course, be equipped with solid missiles, various types of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, and advanced technology for unmanned enemy water entry, such as radar range reduction, red-light signals, and sound and sound recording.
Another important feature of these vessels is that they are repaired after a long period of time, so it should be possible to launch new vessels from a port other than the country of origin for at least two years.
However, the continued delay means that ships with the latest technology, which has been touted as a potential driver of Germany's planned road power, will be out of date once they are in service, Die Zeit reports.
The F125's timelessness made headlines last year when the German Navy publicly refused to allow the boat to go to sea and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
It was the first time that the Navy had returned a ship to its manufacturer after it had been scrapped.
There is no clear reason for the re-entry, but German media reported that several serious "program and mechanical" flaws prevented the ship from being deployed for a long time.
In particular, programming flaws were particularly acute when the Baden-Wuerttemberg class ships were to be operated by a crew of 120 seamen, part of the crew of the older Bremen class.
And, it turned out that the ship was overweight to a great extent which reduced its performance and reduced the naval capability with the addition of the ship's upgraded hull in the coming days.
The 7,000-tonne "Rheinland-Pfalz" is estimated to be twice the weight of the German World War II-era ship of the same type.
In addition to defective machinery, the cost of the entire project, including training of the crew, is also becoming an issue.
It is reported to have reached 3.1 billion euros (3.6 billion US dollars), up from the previously projected 2.2 billion euros.
The problems facing these new types of ships are being re-affirmed in the wake of recent reports that the German Navy is in decline.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, the chairman of the defense committee in the German parliament, admitted that the navy is currently "lacking in attack ships".
The problem has grown over time, he said, as older ships have been decommissioned and no replacements have been ordered.
He complained that none of the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class ships had ever been commissioned.
The National Trust listens to the private lives of the dwarves
New research is underway in a building in the Scottish Highlands to show how the cockroaches use the highlands for hunting.
It is hoped that the results of this study will provide a clearer picture of the unique behaviour of the reptiles and help to identify the best ways to conserve them.
Research by scientists at the National Trust for Scotland will follow the common and uncommon beetles and the long-eared beetles of the Daubenton family at Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special sound recorders will be installed in key locations throughout the building to monitor our activities throughout the year.
An NHS worker and volunteers will also conduct a walking survey using hand-held microwave sensors.
A sound analysis by a sound expert of all recorded sounds will confirm the line of sound the microphones are talking about and the type of microphones performing certain actions.
A map of the nesting site and a report will be provided to provide a detailed description of the nesting behavior.
Rob Dewar, a conservation consultant for the NTS, believes the results of the study will reveal the most important habitats for the beetles and how they are used by each species.
These recommendations will help to identify the benefits of managing the habitat of the insects such as creating grass for insects to feed on, and to preserve trees for insects and other closely related species.
The number of mosques in Scotland and England has declined dramatically over the past century.
We are affected by the construction and development projects that are disrupting their properties and the lack of housing.
Wind turbines and pipes also cause problems with wind-driven paper and some building materials and with the risk of cat infestations.
The larvae are usually able to see.
However, because they are nocturnal hunters, their ears are more important than their eyes when they catch prey.
We use sound positioning technology to determine the precise location of the insects and the obstacles in their flight path.
The NTS, which manages over 270 historic buildings, 38 parks and 76 000 hectares of land in the country, takes care of the tigers in a critical way.
It has ten trained experts who constantly investigate, monitor and sometimes rescue the bats.
The family also established the first Scottish-specific breed of turkey at Threave House in Dumfries and Galloway, with eight of the ten species of turkey found in Scotland.
Building inspector David Thompson says that the building is the perfect place for the monkeys.
"There is a good place for a wedding in Troas".
"We have old buildings, big trees, and a nice place for the little ones to sleep.
But there was much more to the monkey story, so our job here and in other buildings is to help us understand more about what we need to survive".
He emphasizes the importance of checking for bedbugs before building work, since destroying a bedbugs container without checking can kill up to 400 young bedbugs and save the species.
The musicians are also protected from killing, harassing or harming us or damaging their belongings, which is punishable by law.
Elisabeth Ferrell, the Scottish director of the Bat Conservation Trust, urged the public to come and help.
"We still have a lot to learn about our cows and many of our tribes do not know what cows are like".
Ronaldo denies rape charges as lawyers prepare to sue German newspaper
Cristiano Ronaldo describes the allegations of rape as "rumors", saying people "want to make themselves known" using his name.
His lawyers plan to sue the German newspaper Der Spiegel, which reported the allegations.
The Portuguese national team player and Juventus striker was accused of raping American Kathryn Mayorga in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2009.
He reportedly paid her $375,000 to keep quiet about the incident, Der Spiegel reported Friday.
Speaking in a live video on Instagram to his 142 million followers within hours of the allegations, Ronaldo, 33, denounced the allegations as "rumors".
"No, no, no, no, no. I was like, 'I'm not going to do this.'
What they said today, is a rumor", the five-time Ballon d'Or winner said in front of the camera.
"They want to make themselves known by my name.
It is normal.
They want to be known by my name, but that is part of our job.
I'm a happy man and everything is fine", the actor added with a smile.
Ronaldo's lawyers were preparing to challenge the allegations, which Der Spiegel reported, calling them "unlawful disclosure of allegations of privacy", according to the British news agency Reuters.
Christian Schertz, a lawyer, said the actor was seeking compensation for "the damage to his character by the "seriousness of the injustice, which may be the most serious human rights violations in years".
The alleged abuse allegedly occurred in June 2009 at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting in a bar, Ronaldo and Mayorga reportedly met again in the player's bedroom, where he allegedly raped her in the hip, according to documents issued by the Clark County Superior Court in Nevada.
The mayorga says Ronaldo knelt after the incident and told him that "99 percent" is a "good person" and is not disappointed by that "one percent".
Records indicate that Ronaldo confirmed that the two had had sexual relations, but that they had agreed to it.
The mayor also said he went to the police and had photographs of his injuries taken from the hospital, but later agreed to settle the case without going to court because he felt "fear of abuse" and was worried that he would be "publicly humiliated".
The 34-year-old man says he is now looking to change the agreement because he is still disturbed by what happened.
Ronaldo was on the verge of joining Real Madrid from Manchester United in what was reported to be a loan spell and this summer he joined the super-league Juve for 100 million euros.
Brexit: UK 'may regret it forever' after losing its car industry
The UK "may regret forever" losing its reputation as the world's leading car manufacturer after leaving the European Union, according to Commerce Secretary Greg Clark.
He added: "It is with concern that Toyota UK has told the BBC that if the UK leaves the EU without a deal it will temporarily stop making cars at its factory in Burnaston, near Derby.
"We need to get along", Clark says.
A Japanese automaker said the impact of the delay on the border would be significant if no agreement was reached on the UK's exit from the European Union.
Burnaston, which manufactures Toyota's Auris and Avensis, produced nearly 150,000 vehicles last year, with 90% of those vehicles exported to EU countries.
"My view is that if the UK leaves the EU at the end of March, there will be car production in our factory", said Marvin Cooke, Toyota's Burnaston plant manager.
Other UK automakers have expressed concern that leaving the EU without a deal will result in cross-border trade, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
For example, BMW says it will close a small factory in Oxford one month after Britain leaves the European Union.
The main concern is that car manufacturers are perceived to be selling products that are in trouble in the absence of consensus after the UK's exit from the European Union.
Toyota is working on a "time-to-production" approach, with parts arriving every 37 minutes from manufacturers in the UK and EU to produce the cars ordered.
With the UK's exit from the EU without a deal on 29 March, there could be a suspension of operations over the dispute which the company says could lead to delays and material losses.
It is unlikely that Toyota would have kept a single-day production car in its Derbyshire factory, the company said, and could have stopped production.
Mr. Clark says that Theresa May's plan to leave the EU has some implications for relations with the EU, with Norway "well adjusted to avoid a more stringent border control".
"We need to make a deal", he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme, "We want to make a good deal that not only achieves the goals of this season but also allows us to see the opportunities".
"The reality is that not only Toyota but also other automakers need to be able to maintain the existing supply chain and deliver the right products".
Toyota could not say when production would stop, but over the long term, it warned that rising purchases would reduce the industry's competitiveness in the market and reduce job losses.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked in Burnaston for 24 years and is a member of the factory's trade union, said his members remained concerned: "In my view, once some jobs are eliminated, they never come back.
"We need to establish a stable and credible future for our relations with the European Union", a government spokesperson said.
Trump-Rosenstein meeting may be delayed again, US presidential office says
Donald Trump's big meeting with his deputy, Rod Rosenstein, may be "postponed for another week" as the fight against the nominee for the top vaccine, Brett Kavanaugh, continues, the White House said Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of White House counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian election meddling, Trump supporters' interactions with Russia, and the president's obstruction of justice.
Whether or not Trump would dismiss the ambassador, and whether it would jeopardize Mueller's independence, has been a hot topic in Washington for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had used a recorder to record a conversation with Trump and that the president could be impeached under the 25th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.
Rosenstein denied the claims.
But on Monday, he went to the White House, where there were rumors that he might resign.
Instead, the meeting with Trump, which was held at the UN headquarters in New York, was announced on Thursday.
Trump said he "preferred" not to fire Rosenstein but that the meeting was postponed because he was avoiding a meeting with the Senate Judiciary Committee on the case where Kavanaugh and one of the women accusing him of sexual misconduct, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, both testified.
On Friday, Trump requested that the FBI investigate the Kavanaugh allegations, further delaying the Senate general election.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
When asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, he said: "It's a date that was not agreed upon, maybe this month, maybe another week because of other things going on in the Supreme Court.
But we will all see what happens and I will keep the media updated".
Some journalists disagree with the report: Sanders has not called a meeting in the White House since September 10.
Host Chris Wallace wondered why.
Sanders said the lack of news coverage was not due to the dislike of television reporters "for their unethical behavior", although he said, "I agree with what he says is unethical behavior".
He then said that direct communication between Trump and the media is increasing.
"The president has more time to answer questions than any of his predecessors", he declared, adding what he had just said without proof: "We looked at the numbers".
News conferences still take place, according to Sanders, but "when the media gets a chance to ask the president of the United States directly, it's much better than talking to me.
We try to do this often and you've seen us do it in the last few weeks and it will take time for me to update when you can talk to the president of the United States".
Trump normally receives interviews when he is leaving the White House or attending a press conference or a press conference with visiting dignitaries.
Even a solo media interview is rare.
This week in New York, the president showed why, by repeatedly breaking the law and sometimes appearing in extraordinary ways before a gathering of reporters.
The Health Secretary has written to EU staff at NHS Scotland about fears of Britain's exit from the EU.
The Secretary of State for Health has written to EU staff at the NHS in Scotland expressing his country's gratitude and wishes that they remain in the role after the UK's withdrawal from the EU.
Jeane Freeman, a member of the Scottish Parliament, sent a letter less than six months before Britain's withdrawal from the European Union.
The Scottish Government has already committed to paying the costs of EU citizens who use its services that have been suspended.
In her letter, Ms Freeman said: "In the summer, negotiations between the UK and the EU on the outcome continued, with a decision expected this autumn.
But the UK government should step up its preparations in the event of no deal.
I know these are very difficult times for all of us.
So I wanted to talk about it again today by showing how much I value the contribution of every worker, regardless of their nationality.
My colleagues from the EU countries bring practical experience and knowledge that reinforces and refines the work done in healthcare and is beneficial to the patients and the families we serve.
Scotland is certainly your home, and we would like you to stay".
Christion Abercrombie undergoes emergency surgery after suffering a head injury
Tennessee State Tigers quarterback Christion Abercrombie underwent emergency surgery after suffering a head injury in Saturday's 31-27 loss to the Vanderbilt Commodores, according to Tennesseean spokesman Mike Organ.
Tennessee State head coach Rod Reed told reporters that the injury occurred just before the first half break.
"It came through my side and just fell over", Reed said.
Coaches and doctors added oxygen to Abercrombie's body on the side of the field before putting him on the sidelines and taking him to further examination.
A Tennessee State team member told WSMV reporter Chris Harris in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie was discharged from surgery at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "no explanation was available for the extent of the injury/length of time" and that Tennessee State is trying to determine when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a sophomore, was in his first year playing for Tennessee State after being traded from Illinois.
On Sunday, he scored a goal before leaving the game, where he made a total of 18 goals.
Foreign buyers will be exempt from most government certificates when buying real estate in the UK
Foreign buyers are facing higher taxes on their property purchases in the UK, with the excess money being used to help homeless people under new policies by UK politicians.
This is to prevent Corbyn's campaign to attract young voters
Tax on government-issued documents charged to ordinary non-taxpayers in the UK
The Treasurer plans to raise Â£120 million a year to help the homeless
Foreign buyers are facing higher taxes on their UK real estate purchases, with the excess money being used to help homeless people, Theresa May announced today.
The scheme appears to be an attempt to thwart Jeremy Corbyn's ambitious plan to attract young voters by promising them cheaper housing and paying higher taxes to the working poor.
Increasing taxes on government-issued documents for individuals and corporations that do not pay taxes in the UK, where the excess money is intended to reinforce the government's efforts to combat homelessness.
The high tax burden, which is in addition to the existing governmental documentation, includes higher rates imposed over the past two years on second home owners and renters, with the tax rate reaching three percent.
The treasurer expects the scheme to raise Â£120 million annually.
A 13th round of foreclosures on newly built London homes bought by non-residents in the UK has raised prices and made it difficult for first-time buyers to live in them.
Many affluent areas of the country, particularly the capital, have become "uninhabited cities" because large numbers of foreign real estate buyers spend a lot of time out of the country.
The new measures come weeks after Boris Johnson called for lower federal income tax rates to help young people own their own homes.
He accused major construction companies of keeping property prices high in land-locked areas and urged Mrs May to waive the tax on low-cost housing as a response to the "questionable housing" problem in the UK.
Mr Corbyn has announced a number of exciting reform proposals, including a control of rent and a cap on the willingness of independent landlords to "evict tenants without good reason".
He even wants to give the council the power to build new buildings.
"I said last year that I would make a big effort to revive the British dream; that life should be better for every new generation", Mrs May said.
And that means we have to solve the real estate market problems.
The UK will continue to welcome people who wish to live, work and seek a life here.
However, it is not likely to be as easy for non-UK residents and foreign companies looking to buy a home as it is for hard-working UK residents.
For many, the dream of owning a home has been seriously shattered, and sleeping in a bad place is becoming a reality".
Jack Ross: 'My biggest goal is to coach the Scotland national team'
Sunderland manager Jack Ross says his "big goal" is to coach the Scotland national team for a while.
The Scot, 42, is looking to do his best to get the North-Eastern side back in the best of times, finishing third in the Championship, three points clear of the top flight.
He went to train at the Stadium of Light this summer after St Mirren returned to the Scottish Championship last season.
"I wanted to play for my country as a player.
I was called up to the B team and that was it", Ross told BBC Scotland's Sportsound.
"But I grew up watching the Scotland team at Hampden often with my dad as a kid and it's something that always made me come back.
The opportunity comes when I can coach the team well".
Ross' predecessors as Sunderland coaches included Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former Alloa Athletic manager says he feels reassured after stepping into the big coaching ranks of the legendary club, having previously turned down offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"My achievement at the moment will be measured by asking myself, 'Can I get this club back into the Premier League?'
"Because of the nature and infrastructure of this club, there is no doubt that they should go to the Premier League".
"It is not an easy task to achieve, but I can only see myself achieving here if I can't get the club back in the league".
Ross has only three years of coaching experience, after a long spell as assistant manager at Dumbarton and 15 months as Hearts coach.
He helped Alloa avoid relegation to the Third Division and turned relegated St Mirren into the Second Division, winning the league title the following season.
And Ross says he feels better now after his career spells at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
"It was possible that the paths would cross in their own way", he recalled saying while coaching Alloa.
"I certainly thought that coaching was more important to me than playing.
It sounds amazing but no matter, I've lived a good life and enjoyed my accomplishments.
But playing can be difficult.
There are many things you can do each week.
I'm still going through it but it's in the form of a stereotype and a shadow of a job but I feel that training is a good thing.
I have always wanted to coach and now I am doing it, feeling that it is the career I have done quietly for the rest of my adult life".
You can hear the full broadcast on Sportsound on Sunday, September 30th, on Radio Scotland between 12:00pm and 13:00pm UK time.
The best time to take one is 5:30 p.m. on Saturday, research has shown.
The hot summer sun has increased the number of British people going to the bar, which is not stable but puts a lot of pressure on the various restaurants.
The Yutubari groups had a 2.7 percent increase in arrivals in July; but restaurant attendance fell by 4.8 percent, according to figures.
Peter Martin, CGA's chief financial officer, who compiled the figures, said: "The continued sunshine and continued progress of England in the World Cup means that July will follow the June trend, with the number of restaurants up 2.8 per cent, with the exception of restaurants which have been hit hard.
The 1.8 percent decline in restaurant business in June was worse in July.
Bar operations have proven to be more successful than restaurants in the decline.
The food courts were also exposed to the sun, although not as severely as the restaurants themselves.
It seems that people wanted to go out just to get a drink.
In the pubs, alcohol sales rose by 6.6 percent in one month, while food dropped by three percent".
Paul Newman, of the entertainment and hospitality analytics firm RSM, said: "The numbers are fluctuating as we have seen since late April.
The environment and other factors affecting mass media and sports activities remain a major driver of the transformation of the non-portable goods industry.
Not surprisingly, as restaurant companies continue to struggle, despite a 4.8% year-on-year decline in sales, this is likely to be particularly distressing in addition to the current downward pressure on purchases.
"The extremely hot summer has come at a bad time for restaurant owners and time will tell if the moderate temperatures we experienced in August will provide the relief we have been waiting for".
Total bar and restaurant sales, including new openings, were 2.7 percent in July, reflecting a slowdown in the opening of branded bars and restaurants.
The Coffer Peach Tracker tracks the bar and restaurant industry and collects and analyzes the performance data of 47 companies in the industry, with a combined turnover of Â£9 billion and a benchmark in the industry.
One in five children has a secret social networking account where they hide their parents
One in five children, some as young as 11, have private social networking accounts where they hide their parents and teachers, according to research.
A survey of 20,000 high school students found an increase in "fake" Instagram pages.
This report highlights the fear of sexual abuse that is being reported
Twenty percent of students said they had a "normal" account with their parents
One in three children, aged just 11, would set up secret social networking accounts and hide them from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students found a dramatic increase in "fake" Instagram accounts, where they want to comment on the photo-sharing platform Instagram.
This information reflects the fear of sexual abuse that is being spread.
Twenty percent of students said they were doing well with no bad things on their "normal" accounts for their parents, while they had more in their private accounts.
One parent accidentally stumbled upon the private website of her 13-year-old daughter and found the teenager asking others to "rape" her.
A study by Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference (HMC) of independent schools found that 40 per cent of children aged 11 to 18 had dual profiles, with half of those admitting to having private accounts.
"It is unfortunate that teenagers would be tricked into setting up a website where parents and teachers cannot find them", said HMC Director Mike Buchanan.
Eilidh Doyle will be the "actors' spokesperson" at the Scottish Actors' Conference
Eilidh Doyle was appointed to the Scottish Athletic Council as a non-executive director on the executive board at the annual general meeting.
Doyle is a Scottish international and the chairman of the board Ian Beattie described the decision as an opportunity for the sport's management to benefit from the extensive international experience gained over the decades.
"Eilidh is highly respected in the sports community in Scotland, England and around the world and we are confident that the Scottish players can benefit greatly from having her on the board", said Beattie.
"I am excited to be the voice of the players and I hope I can really contribute and help drive sport in Scotland", Doyle said.
The American, who won medals in the 200m and 400m at the 1996 Atlanta Games and is one of four Olympic gold medallists to win and is now a regular commentator for the BBC, has been left paralyzed after suffering a short-term traumatic brain injury (TIA).
She tweeted: "I had a stroke a month ago.
I can't walk.
The doctors said that the time would determine whether I would recover or not.
It was a difficult operation, but I recovered, learned to walk again, and today I am practicing my legs!
Thank you for sending me encouraging messages!"
A milk pump advertisement that depicts a mother and a cow has sparked a public outcry online
A company that makes breast pumps has sparked a public outcry online after an advertisement compared breastfeeding women to lactating cows.
To launch what has been described as the "world's first noise-free milk pump", Elvie's technology company released a promotional video that engaged a large audience to showcase the flexibility the new pump gives women who want to express themselves.
Four real parents dance on a lawn in a song that includes the words: "Yes, I'm grass, but you can't see my tail" and "In case you haven't noticed, it's not the beads, it's my breasts".
The dictum is: "Pump it out, pump it out, I feed the baby, pump it out, pump it out, I suck my wives".
However, the publicity announcement, which was made public on the company's Facebook page, sparked a controversy online.
With 77,000 views and thousands of comments, the video received mixed reviews, with many saying it exposes the "bad" that is happening in the dairy industry.
"It is a misconception to use cows to advertise this product.
One said: "They need to be pregnant just like us in order to bear and give milk, unless their young are eaten on the day they are born".

Another commented: "It is understandable that it is frustrating for parents and their babies.
But why don't they use the same advertising for breast milk for parents who decide to keep their babies?"
Another added: "That is an over-the-top advertisement".
Others defended the announcement, with one woman admitting that she found the song "amazing".
"I think this is a good idea.
I even took one when I was breast-feeding.
Pumping made me feel good and comfortable.
The ad was a bit silly, but I took it seriously.
One writer says: "'This is a wise merchandise.'"
Another commented: "The ad is targeted at mothers who are breastfeeding (often at work or in the bathroom) and feel like 'cows.'"
This is not an advertisement that praises or condemns the dairy industry.
At the end of the video, a group of women are shown dancing with invisible pumps tucked into their bras.
The idea behind the campaign is based on the idea that many women who use a milk pump say they feel like cows.
However, the Elvie pump has no leakage, no strings or hooks and fits nicely into the breastfeeding woman's bra, giving the woman the freedom to move, hold their babies and even go outside to breastfeed.
Ana Balarin, partner and Head of Early Childhood Development at Mother, commented: "Elvie's pump is a revolutionary product that should be marketed in a unique way.
By comparing women to cows, we wanted to show the milking and its limitations, while also showing the warmth and the amazing cosmology that the pump will bring.
This is not the first time Elvie's pump has been the subject of a major media coverage.
At London Fashion Week, a mother of two appeared to be showing off a fashion doll by fashion designer Marta Jakubowski using the same product.
Hundreds of immigrant children quietly moved to camps on the Texas border
The number of immigrant children detained has risen sharply despite monthly border crossings that have not changed significantly, partly due to the Trump administration's tough policies that have made it harder to provide child care.
Most of the survivors were also undocumented immigrants and feared that they might jeopardize their ability to stay in the country if they applied for a child.
The situation worsened in June when government officials announced that adoption and adult adoption would be required and that information would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, a senior official with the Immigration and Customs Enforcement, testified before Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who had requested to marry minors without an adult.
The agency later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had never committed another crime.
"About 80 percent of people who want to be insured or insured family members are here illegally and most of them are immigrants who have committed crimes.
"So, we are still tracking these people", Mr. Albence said.
In an effort to speed up the process of prosecuting children, authorities introduced new rules requiring some to be brought to justice within a month of their arrest, rather than 60 days, as had been the practice for immigration officials.
Many are seen via video call, rather than in person, to ask an immigration judge to verify their legal residency.
Those deemed unfit for release will be immediately returned to their country of origin.
The longer children spend in detention, the more likely they are to become anxious and depressed, leading to anger and conflict and attempts to escape, according to immigration workers and reports from the system over the past few months.
Advocates say that concerns are expressed in a large facility like Tornillo, where signs of distress could be overlooked due to the size.
They add that moving children to tents without giving them enough time to relax emotionally and say goodbye to friends can create the depression that many struggle with.
Syria tells US, France and Turkey that 'occupying forces' must respond immediately
Speaking at the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also called for the return of Syrian refugees, despite the eight-year-old civil war in the country.
Moualem, who is also the deputy prime minister, said that foreign forces were illegally on Syrian soil under the pretext of fighting terrorism and that they would be dealt with appropriately.
He told the assembly: "The troops must return at once and without delay".
Moualem stressed that the "war on terror is almost over" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011, and more than a million have been displaced.
He said Damascus would continue "to fight this holy war until all parts of Syria are cleared" of terrorist groups and "foreigners illegally in the country".
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, primarily to train and advise Syrian Kurdish and Arab forces from President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 troops on the ground in the war-torn part of the country.
On the issue of the accident, Moualem said that the conditions were sufficient for the return and criticized "some Western countries" for "instigating terrorism" and keeping refugees abroad.
"We have appealed to international organizations and aid agencies to facilitate their return", he said.
"They would turn politics into a matter of humanitarian aid".
The United States and the European Union have warned that there may be no support for the reconstruction of Syria until there is a deal between Assad and his opposition to end the war.
Diplomats at the United Nations say the recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a no-fly zone in Idlib has created an opportunity to press for political dialogue.
The Russian-Turkish agreement prevented a Russian-backed offensive against the Syrian army in a region of 3 million people.
However, Moualem stressed that the agreement clearly set "deadlines" and expressed confidence that military action against jihadist forces, including the al-Qaeda-affiliated Nusra Front, would "be eliminated".
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes that the first meeting of a new government and opposition committee will soon be held to draft a post-war Syrian constitution and prepare for elections.
Moualem directed the Syrian government to attend the committee, saying that the work of the committee should focus on "reviewing the provisions of the current constitution" and warned of possible disruption.
Why Trump will win a second term
According to the rationale, Mr. Trump is the winner of the 2020 election, except for the possibility of a few eyewitnesses who may believe the president's candidacy and the fact that there are serious problems with his administration ending prematurely.
"This is the last great presidential game ever!"
To date, there is no evidence that the viewers have ever failed.
Since 2014, ratings have more than doubled to 1.05 on CNN and 1.6 million on MSNBC.
Fox News has an average audience of 2.4 million, up 1.7 from four years ago, according to Nielsen, and MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" is the most watched television program with 3.5 million viewers for the night's prime time newscasts.
"This is the hell people would be thrown into because they don't feel anything", said Neal Baer, director of the ABC drama "Designated Survivor", which tells the story of a cabinet secretary who becomes president after the attack on the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, a former comedy writer and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys" Club, has a different perspective.
He recalls being hit by a car in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told her that she would vote for Mr. Trump.
"Why?" he asked.
"Because she makes me laugh", Mrs. Scovell told me.
There is entertainment in the midst of a storm.
Of course, while there is nothing else like it on TV, the story behind the Washington State could be where Roe v. Wade's trial will take place, whether immigrant families will reunite, and the state of the global economy.
Apparently, only good viewing is available to TV viewers.
And, it is only the public who are informed when you find yourself watching six hours of television where various experts are debating Bob Woodward's "uninterrupted interrogation" technique in his book "Fear", a coat made from Paul Manafort's signature 15000 dollar (a "heavy-duty", according to The Washington Post) and Stormy Daniels's disgusting portrayal of Mr. Trump's body.
I, for one, don't see Super Mario in the same way anymore.
"One of the things he does that doesn't seem to be a show is a show where he gives you updates every night", said Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of "Pawn Stars", referring to Trump's show changing cast and changing the story every day (in which he blames the NFL show, praising Kim Jong-un).
You should not miss a single episode or be left behind.
I tried to contact Mr. Fleiss this week, it was 26 degrees Celsius outside his home on the north shore of Kauai, but he was in the house watching MSNBC while he was doing CNN.
He couldn't get away, even with Brett Kavanaugh facing the Senate Judiciary Committee and the future Supreme Court standing still.
"I remember when we were having crazy conversations a few days ago and people were saying, 'This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization,'" Mr. Fleiss told me.
"I thought it was a joke, but it turned out to be the truth".

Foreign money is being used heavily in the midterm elections amidst a low number of candidates.
It is not surprising that the upcoming 17th Pennsylvania general election is a very expensive one, given the change in congressional districts and the fact that we have two congressional candidates running for the same seat.
Recently, the city of Pittsburgh has again featured a Democrat representative named Conor Lamb, who won his seat in another district in a special election this winter.
Lamb is facing the incumbent, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents Pennsylvania's old 12th district, which is closely tied to the new 17th district.
The maps were added to the map after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the former districts were unconstitutionally redistricted to give the Republicans a chance.
The contest in the 17th district has made campaign finance a persistent issue between the major parties, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a household name in Pennsylvania after winning by a narrow margin in a March special election for Pennsylvania's 18th congressional district.
The seat had been held by a Republican for ten years, and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 votes.
Political analysts have indicated that Democrats may win by a narrow margin.
The United States considers punishing El Salvador for its support for China, then retaliating
Diplomats learned that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, with Washington's disapproval.
Mr. Trump held a successful consultation with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017 where he also owned a hotel in Panama until the partners were fired by the Trump Organization's management team.
State Department officials have decided to request the return of U.S. officials from diplomatic missions to El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama following "recent decisions not to recognize Taiwan", State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said in a statement earlier this month.
But the sanctions were only considered for El Salvador, which received an estimated US$140 million in aid in 2017, including drug control, development assistance and economic assistance.
The proposed sanctions, which included cutbacks in funding and visa restrictions, would have severely damaged the Central American country and caused rising unemployment and murder rates.
As the summit continued, leaders of North and Central America postponed a high-level meeting focused on security and economic development to follow up on a similar meeting last year that was seen as a step toward curbing immigration to the United States.
But in mid-September, senior officials made it clear that they wanted the meeting to continue, immediately dropping any consideration of sanctions against El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence is now expected to address the summit, which is now scheduled for mid-October, a sign of the leadership's strengthening position at the summit, according to lawmakers.
And three U.S. envoys returned quietly to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without any new strong messages or sanctions from Washington.
A spokesman for the US president, Mr Bolton, declined to comment on whether the conversation was interpreted by three US officials, including two lawmakers, who spoke at the end of the conversation and requested anonymity.
Their claims were confirmed by an independent investigator who works closely with the government and who also requested anonymity.
Studying the history
The next person to be fired is likely to be special counsel Robert Mueller, for reporting to Mr. Trump that he may be a threat to public order, where there is evidence in the public record.
Mr. Mueller said he was re-evaluating his investigation to determine whether Mr. Trump's campaign had any ties to Russia in the election attack.
If Congress changes its stance, Mr. Trump may find himself held accountable for the allegations made against him by the agency, as he prepares to return to the polls and possibly his own circle of friends.
That's a lot of speculation, and I'm not saying I'm not suggesting that Mr. Trump's campaign is not being taken seriously, or that he's not being taken seriously in Europe.
There are choices that we all face on both sides of the Atlantic that determine how long we may be faced with each other.
In 1938, the German authorities were ready to overthrow Hitler if the West had stood up and supported the Munich slave trade.
We failed and missed the chance to prevent the killing of people for many years but it happened.
The course of history is largely dependent on these historical events and the democratic process can be delayed or delayed.
Americans are in the middle of this massive process right now.
What can we do when Mr. Trump fires his new envoy, Rod Rosenstein, who is in charge of Mr. Mueller's future intelligence?
Rosenstein has been in hot water since the newspaper reported, last year, that he had called for a secret presidential vote and spread rumors that he was unfit to be president.
Mr. Rosenstein says the story reported by The Times is not true.
"How do we respond to the new FBI investigation recently requested of Brett Kavanaugh when it is not conducted in a thorough or impartial manner; or when it is confirmed that he is the Supreme Court's chief justice despite credible allegations of sexual misconduct and fraudulent testimony?
Besides, will we vote in the midterm elections for a Congress that holds Mr. Trump accountable?
If we fail to do so, democracy will be back in its tracks.
But I hope that we will not fail, because of the lessons I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the Nazis, who had occupied the embassy where I lived.
He survived, emigrated to America and 60 years later sent me to light the candles on the tables with the Nazi logo.
As long as I am keeping my legacy, how can I be confident about our future?"

Rangers' Graham Dorrans looks confident ahead of Rapid Vienna
Rangers are hosting Rapid Vienna on Thursday, and are confident that beating the Australians, after drawing with Spanish side Villarreal earlier this month, will put them in a good position to leave Group G of the Europa League.
A knee injury to midfielder Graham Dorrans after a first-team appearance in a 2-2 draw with Villarreal but he believes Rangers can take the result as the start of something big.
The 31-year-old said: "It was a good score because Villarreal was a good team.
"We went into the game hoping to make a difference, but we scored.
We may have won the game in the end, but overall, a draw seems like a good way to end the game.
Maybe the best players in the first half we will play in the second half and they played better overall.
On Thursday, there is another big European game.
I believe we can get three points but it will be a big game because they won their last game, but with the fans, I am sure we can play well and win.
Last year was a big year, in the middle of everything that happened I broke down and changed my team but there is something good about the team I am playing for now.
It's a good team and my teammates are enjoying it, the training is going well.
I hope we can find a way to win now, forget about last year and get to the goal".
Women would be sleep deprived due to current concerns about pension funding
Although some respondents had a clear understanding of the type of care they wanted, few would talk to their family members about it.
Nearly half of respondents in a Nationwide survey said they would discuss the cost of long-term care with their spouse.
Only 10 percent said that they had spoken to their children about the subject.
"People want to be cared for by family members, but they don't discuss the steps to do it", said Holly Snyder, vice president of insurance at Nationwide.
Here is where they should start.
Talk to your spouse and children: You cannot prepare your family for care if you do not make your wishes known in advance.
Work with your counselor and family to discuss where and how you can get treatment, as these options may be a cost-effective option.
Get a financial advisor: Your financial advisor can also help you find ways to pay your expenses.
Options for long-term care include general long-term care insurance, supplemental health insurance to be funded to cover the costs or self-funded as long as you have the money.
Find a solution for your legal documents: Avoid going to court all the time.
Find alternative treatment options to appoint a representative to oversee your treatment and ensure that doctors respect your wishes if you are unable to express your opinion.
Also, you should consider your financial limitations.
You can choose a trusted financial advisor and make sure your bills are paid when you are unable to pay.
Don't forget the little details: Imagine that your elderly parent has an urgent health problem and is on his way to the hospital.
Can you answer questions about the medications he takes and his physical condition?
Write down the information to prepare.
"It's not just about the money", Martin asks, "but who are the doctors?"
"What medications are given?
Who will take care of the dogs?
That arrangement exists".
Man shot multiple times in Ilfracombe
A man was shot multiple times with a gun as he walked home after a night out.
The victim, aged 40, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, abdomen and arm.
Police described the shooting, which occurred at around 02:30 pm UK time, as "an act of negligence".
The victim never saw the killer.
His injuries were not life-threatening and the police requested that eyewitnesses be called.
Earthquake and Tsunami in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed in the powerful earthquake and tsunami that struck the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, according to officials, with the death toll expected to rise.
While the reception and transmission systems were not functioning, the authorities involved in the relief efforts were unable to obtain information from the Donggala area, which is located north of Palu near the epicentre of the 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were rescued after the disaster.
Here are some of the important facts about Palu and Donggala, Sulawesi:
Palu is a city in Central Sulawesi, located near the western coast of Sulawesi Island, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city was recalling 40 years ago when it was hit by an earthquake and tsunami.
Donggala is a coastal region extending over 300 km (180 mi) in the northwest of the island of Sulawesi.
The area is a sub-provincial administrative region, with an estimated population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fishing and farming are the main economic activities in Central Sulawesi, particularly in the area around the coast of Donggala Bay.
Nickel mining is also important in the province, but the mining industry is predominant in Morowali, on the other side of the Sulawesi coast.
Palu and Donggala have been hit by several tsunamis in the past 100 years, according to the Indonesian Institute for Disaster Management.
In 1938, a tsunami killed over 200 people and damaged hundreds of homes in Donggala.
A tsunami also hit the western part of Donggala in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia is located above the Pacific Ring of Fire and is permanently seismically active.
Here are some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis that have occurred in recent years:
2004: A massive earthquake off the west coast of Aceh province in Indonesia's northern Sumatra on December 26 triggered a tsunami that hit 14 countries, killing 226,000 people along the Indian Ocean coast, half of them Acehites.
2005: A series of powerful earthquakes occurred off the coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds died on Nias Island, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8 magnitude earthquake strikes southern Java, Indonesia's most populous island, causing a tsunami that devastates the southern coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: A 7.6 magnitude earthquake struck near Padang, the capital of West Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: A magnitude 7.5 earthquake struck off Sumatra, on one of the Mentawai Islands, causing a tsunami that raised water levels to 10 meters, destroyed several villages, and killed 300 people.
2016: A small earthquake hits the Aceh province of Pidie Jaya, causing extensive damage and people are horrified as it reminds them of the 2004 tsunami.
No tsunami was recorded, but more than 100 people died in the floodwaters.
2018: A powerful earthquake struck the tourist island of Lombok in Indonesia, killing more than 500 people, mostly in the northern part of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of tourists temporarily homeless.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested for domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, was arrested on charges of sedition.
Palin, 29, of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, obstructed a domestic violence complaint and denied arrest, according to a report released Saturday by the Alaska State Troopers.
According to the police report, when a female acquaintance tried to call the police to report the alleged crimes, she was ripped off her cell phone.
Palin is being held in the Mat-Su Pretrial Facility and has posted an unsecured bond of 500, according to KTUU.
He was brought before a court on Saturday, where he said he "absolutely disagrees with the charges" when asked whether he was admitting or not admitting the charges, according to the TV channel.
Palin is charged with three Class A misdemeanors, which carries a maximum penalty of up to a year in prison and a fine of $250,000.
He was also charged with a Class B misdemeanor, punishable by a day in jail and a fine of $2,000.
This is not the first time Palin has been charged with criminal offences.
In December 2017, she was accused of molesting her father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the assault.
He is currently on trial before Alaska's Veteran's Court.
In January 2016, she was charged with domestic violence, obstruction of reporting of a domestic crime and being under the influence of alcohol in connection with the crime.
His girlfriend wanted him to punch her in the face.
Sarah Palin was ostracized by veterans groups in 2016 after she linked her son's violent behavior to the trauma of his deployment to Iraq.
Indonesia earthquake and tsunami: Hundreds of dead
At least 384 people died after a devastating earthquake hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The 7.5 magnitude earthquake caused a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
The fire has destroyed communications lines with the death toll expected to rise in the coming days.
The quake struck central Sulawesi, located northeast of Indonesia's capital, Jakarta.
Videos circulating on the Internet show when the earthquake began.
Hundreds of people gathered at a beach festival in Palu city when the tsunami washed ashore.
Federal prosecutors would seek a rare death sentence for a terrorist attack in NYC.
New York state prosecutors are seeking the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, suspected of a suicide bombing in New York City that killed eight people; a rare sentence not carried out in the state for a crime against the state since 1953.
Saipov, 30, is accused of using a rented Home Depot truck to hit pedestrians and cyclists on the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan in October.
To uphold the death sentence, prosecutors must find Saipov guilty of "deliberately" killing eight people and "deliberately" causing serious injury, according to a death sentence subpoena filed in the Southern District of New York.
Both of these offenses could result in the death penalty, according to court documents.
Weeks after the attack, the country's Supreme Court indicted Saipov on 22 counts including eight counts of assisting in the financing of illegal activities, which were used by the state prosecutors in criminal trials and charges of terrorism and vehicle damage.
The attack required "considerable planning and deliberation", prosecutors said, describing Saipov's conduct as "extremely brutal and extremely vicious".
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov injured, tortured and killed the family and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco", the statement said.
Five of the victims were Argentine tourists.
It has been ten years since the last District Court of New York issued a judgment with the death penalty.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of the murder of two drug dealers but was later sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last death sentence in a New York state trial was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple who were convicted of spying for the former Soviet Union two years before the Cold War.
The Rosenbergs were executed in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, a native of Uzbekistan, has shown no remorse for his actions in the days and months following the attack, according to court documents.
He told investigators that he felt better about what he had done, according to police.
Saipov told authorities he had the idea for the attack after watching videos of ISIS terrorists on his phone, according to the indictment.
He also requested that a flag of the ISIS terrorist group be displayed in the hospital room where he was being treated, according to police.
He pleaded no contest to 22 counts of fraud.
David Patton, one of the defendants representing Saipov, said he was "clearly disappointed" by the prosecution's decision.
"We believe that the decision to seek the death penalty rather than a plea bargain and a sentence of life imprisonment without possibility of parole will add to the shock of all those affected by this incident", Patton said.
The defense team for the accused Saipov had asked the prosecutors not to elaborate on the death penalty.
Tory MP says Nigel Farage should be given the task of negotiating Britain's exit from the European Union
Nigel Farage is determined to 'motivate people' today with a protest at the Tory party conference.
The former leader of the UKIP party says politicians should be removed from the 'shadow' of criticism of the EU, with one of Theresa May's own MPs saying she should be in charge of negotiations with the EU.
Conservative non-executive Peter Bone told the Birmingham delegation that Britain was "out of the loop" now that Mr Farage is the Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union.
But Mrs May's challenge is to unite her diverse colleagues to bring Tory Remainers into the urban protests against Brexit.
The Prime Minister is struggling to keep his plan to withdraw from the European Union on track amidst attacks from both those who want Britain to leave the European Union and those who want it to remain in the European Union.
The partners insisted that he would continue to try to find a compromise with Belgium despite some negative reactions, and pressed him to criticize the EU and the Labour Party for their decisions and problems.
Mr Bone told the Leave Means Leave march in Solihull that he wanted to 'dismantle the UK's plan to leave the European Union'.
He said Mr. Farage should be included and given the task of negotiating with Belgium.
'If he were in charge,' he said, 'we would have gotten out of there.'
The MP for Wellingborough continued: 'I will be pushing for the UK to leave the EU but we need to scrap the UK's plan to leave the EU.'
Speaking from the European Union, he said: 'We have not fought world wars to show our weakness.
We want to establish our own laws in our own country.'
Mr Bone rejected the popular demands from the 2016 election: 'The idea that the British have changed their minds and want to remain in the Union is completely untrue.'
Tory Brexit campaigner Andrea Jenkyns, who was also on the tour, told reporters: 'I just want to say: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
'The UK's exit from the EU is not popular with the public, the opposition will not vote for it, it is not popular with our party and the reformers we are working with are the ones who are taking to the streets to get us elected in the first place.
Let the plan go and start listening.'
In a similar message to Mrs May, he said: 'The Prime Minister stays in office when he fulfills his promises.'
Mr Farage told the political party on the march that they must feel 'shadow' if they are to overturn the 2016 referendum resolution.
'Now what is left is trust between us, the people and the political establishment.'
'They were trying to undermine the UK's plan to leave the EU and we are here today to tell you that we will never tolerate you being prosecuted.'
In a message to the cheering crowd, he said: 'I want to put our political party, which is about to plot the UK's exit from the European Union, in the shade.
'We urge the public to protect this country which has given us the victory in taking Britain out of the EU and we will never rest until we are independent, led, and proud of the UK.'
Meanwhile, those who wanted Britain to remain in the union made the journey to Birmingham before stopping for two hours in the city center.
Conservative reformers waved Tory flags protesting Britain's exit from the European Union after launching a group over the weekend.
Labour members including Lord Adonis criticised the conservatives for the security issues they faced on the party agenda as the meeting opened.
He added: 'These are the people who tell us we have a technological system and that all of Canada's technology is advanced, customs-free borders, free trade across borders and Ireland.'
'That is not true at all.
There's nothing better than getting Britain out,' he added.
Warren plans to 'think hard' about running for president
Senator Elizabeth Warren says she will "consider seriously running for president" after the November election.
The Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts Democrat spoke out in a town hall in western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, a vocal critic of President Donald Trump, is running for a second term in November against Republican Rep. Geoff Diehl, who was vice president of Trump's 2016 Massachusetts campaign.
He has been mentioned in various rumours as a potential contender for the 2020 presidential election.
The event on Saturday afternoon in Holyoke was his 36th meeting with voters in his district using the two-house system since Trump took office.
The speaker asked him if he planned to run for president.
Warren responded: "It is time for women to go to Washington and rebuild our fractured government under a woman".
One person arrested in shooting death of LSU football player Sims
On Saturday, Baton Rouge, La., police announced that a suspect has been arrested in the shooting death of LSU basketball player Wayde Sims.
Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson at 11 a.m. eastern time, according to a news release.
They released a video of Friday's robbery, asking people to help them identify the person in the photos.
Sims, 20, was shot dead near Southern University in the early hours of Friday.
"Wayde Sims was fatally shot in the head and died instantly", Police Chief Murphy J. Paul told reporters on Saturday, according to 247sports.
Wayde was on his way to rescue his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was questioned and admitted to being at the scene of the shooting with a gun and to shooting Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and taken to the custody of the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
The 6-foot-2 junior next season in Baton Rouge, Sims played in 32 games with 10 starts last season and averaged 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton is close to winning the World Championship after the team confirmed victory over Sebastian Vettel
It was clear from Valtteri Bottas's qualifying points ahead of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday that Mercedes would be a big contender in the car race.
From the start of the race, Bottas started well and nearly beat Hamilton as he fought for his place in the first two laps and caused Vettel to shoot his teammate.
Vettel went to the car's tire change first and left Hamilton behind, a decision that was made.
Mercedes cars performed well and came behind Vettel, but Hamilton took the lead after a collision with a Ferrari and a driver's misdirection left a gap and forced him to fight for his place in the third corner.
Max Verstappen started behind the other cars and came seventh after the first lap on his 21st birthday.
He is leading most of the race while riding on his wheels to try to finish ahead of Kimi Raikkonen in fourth.
He also reached the 44th lap, but failed to improve his speed in the final eight laps, with Raikkonen coming in fourth.
It is a hard day because Valtteri has done a good job all weekend and has become a better person.
Hamilton said: "The team did an outstanding job to get the first and second place".
It was a really bad body language.
President Donald Trump criticized Sen. Dianne Feinstein on Saturday for insisting that she did not publish a letter written by Christine Blasey Ford accusing the future Supreme Court Justice, Brett Kavanaugh, of sexually abusing her.
Speaking during his campaign in West Virginia, the president did not directly address Ford's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, but suggested that the Senate experience had shown that people were "bad, cruel and untrustworthy".
"The only thing that can happen and is good is what happened a few days ago in the Senate, where you see anger, what you see people angry and bad and cruel and unfaithful".
"When you look at what's published and what's published without permission, then you can say, 'Oh, I never did that.
I did not".
Do You Remember?
Dianne Feinstein, have you ever published this without permission?
Remember his reply . . . you once published the article without permission: "eh, eh, what?
Oh, no, not at all.
I never finished it".
Fine, except for a little.
We have published without permission... No, we have not published without permission", he said, to please the senator.
Feinstein received a letter explaining the Kavanaugh indictment filed by Ford in July, and it was released without a warrant in early September, but Feinstein denied the unauthorized release from his office.
"I have never concealed the allegations of Dr. Ford, nor did I make a legitimate announcement of his story", Feinstein told the committee, reported The Hill.
"He asked me to keep it a secret, and I did as he told me".
But his denial was apparently not well received by the president, who commented during Saturday night's campaign: "I'll tell you, it was a very bad body language.
Maybe he didn't, but it was the worst body language I've ever seen".
Continuing the defense of the future Supreme Court justice, who was accused of sexual misconduct by three women, the president said Democrats would use the charges to their own advantage.
"They were determined to get back on their feet in every way possible.
You see evil, cruelty, they don't care who they can hurt, who they can beat to get to power and control".
Elite League: Dundee Stars defeated Belfast Giants 5-3
Patrick Dwyer scored the Giants' two goals against Dundee
Dundee Stars reversed their victory in Friday's Elite League when they faced Belfast Giants and won the 5-3 draw in Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants scored two runs early on balls thrown by Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie led the team to a tie before Dwyer reinstated the Giants.
Francois Bouchard scored a goal to tie Dundee before two goals from Lukas Lundvald Nielsen cemented their victory.
It was the third Elite League win of the season for Adam Keefe, who won a penalty shootout 2-1 over Dundee in Belfast on Friday night.
It was the fourth time in the regular season that the two teams met, with the Giants winning their first three games.
Dwyer's opening goal came in a perfect 3:35 to Kendall McFaull, with David Rutherford passing the ball to Beauvillier for a second goal a few minutes later.
In what appeared to be a big game start, Sullivan returned the ball to the team at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt passed the ball to Cownie for a 15-16 penalty.
Dwyer kept the Giants in the lead in the first half when he scored the second goal of the night's game near the end of the first half.
The hosts scored again and Bouchard again tied the score at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran worked together to help Nielsen give Dundee a first-round lead before half-time and he managed to win the game in the final minute.
The Giants, who have now lost four of their last five games, will visit Milton Keynes for the next game on Friday.
A flight attendant died to ensure that hundreds of people on board could survive the earthquake
An Indonesian air traffic controller would have been hailed as a hero after he died trying to land a plane carrying hundreds of passengers safely.
More than 800 people have died and many more are missing after a powerful earthquake struck the island of Sulawesi on Friday, triggering a tsunami.
The last major earthquakes continued to hit the area and many people were evacuated from the ruins of buildings in Palu.
But despite the safety of his colleagues, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his job in the tower that was to be unusually shaken by the storm-affected air traffic control tower at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport Palu.
He continued his work to ensure that Batik Air Flight 6321, which had reached the target, could take off safely.
Then he jumped from the control tower when he thought it was going to fall.
She died in the hospital.
The Indonesian Aviation Authority spokesman Yohannes Sirait said the decision may have saved hundreds of lives, according to Australian ABC News.
We arranged for a helicopter from Balikpapan, Kalimantan, to take her to a large hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he died in this crash before the helicopter reached Palu.
She added: "We are saddened to hear that".
Meanwhile, officials fear the death toll could rise to thousands as the disaster management agency says the reach of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is not complete.
"The number is still rising as many bodies are being covered up and many more people are being left unreached", said Institute spokesperson Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
Flooding of up to six meters damaged Palu where some are scheduled to be buried in a mass grave on Sunday.
Military and cargo aircraft are bringing in aid and supplies.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Every minute, a rescue team comes with bodies.
Fresh water is scarce.
Small shops were looted everywhere".
Jan Gelfand, the head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is trying to help the survivors but we don't know what they will find.
"It's already been dangerous, but it could be worse".
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the country's military: "I ask you all to work day and night to complete every rescue mission.
Are you ready?" reports CNN.
Earlier this year, Indonesia was hit by a major earthquake in Lombok that killed more than 550 people.
Micronesia plane crash: Air Niugini says one person is missing after crashes into a pool
The airline that crashed into the Pacific Ocean in Micronesia is now reporting a man missing after earlier reports that all 47 passengers and crew were safely evacuated from the crash site.
Air Niugini said in a statement that it was unable to identify the man on Saturday afternoon.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to track down the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to a request for further information about the passenger's age or nationality.
Local ships helped rescue other passengers and crew after the plane crashed while attempting to land at the Chuuk Island resort.
Seven people were taken to hospital on Friday, officials said.
The airline said six passengers remained in hospital on Saturday, and all were in good condition.
The cause of the accident is unclear.
The airline and the US Navy concluded that the plane crashed into the valley shortly after takeoff.
Some witnesses believe the plane misjudged the route.
American pilot Bill Jaynes said the plane landed too low.
"That's a wonderful thing", said Jayness.
Jaynes said that he and others managed to get through the swollen water and reached the emergency exit of the sinking plane.
He said the flight crew were terrified and screaming and he suffered minor head injuries.
The US Navy says that nearby sailors created a rescue boat to help bring the crew to shore before the plane sank nearly 30 meters (100 feet) into the water.
Data from the Aviation Safety Network indicates that 111 people may have died in airline accidents recorded in PNG over the past two decades but no fatalities have occurred on Air Niugini aircraft.
The detective showed the night calendar of the woman who was burned alive
The prosecution has filed a complaint on Saturday to retry a man accused of burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.
On Wednesday, U.S. Justice Department Attorney Paul Rowlett gave hours of testimony as an expert witness in a crime scene investigation.
He showed the jury how he used a cell phone to record the various movements of the 29-year-old Quinton Tellis and 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, on the night of her death.
Rowlett said she received location information from several cell phones that showed Tellis was with Chambers the night of her death, contrary to her previous claims, according to The Clarion Ledger.
When reports suggested that his cell phone was on the floor of the Chambers while he was with his friend Michael Sanford, police contacted Sanford.
Sanford went to the start of the witnessing on Saturday and testified that he was out of town that day.
When prosecutors asked whether Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford's car that night, Sanford said he was "lying, because his car was in Nashville".
Another discrepancy is Tellis' claim that he knew Chambers almost two weeks after his death.
Data from the cell phone showed that they had known each other for a week.
Rowlett said that shortly after Chambers' death, Tellis deleted Chambers' text messages, phone calls and her father's address from her phone.
"He left her in his life", Hale says.
The accused is scheduled to make his decision on Sunday.
The judge said it was expected that the verdict would be delivered to the jury during the late hours of that day.
The High Breed: Did they do hip hop, you know?
A trio of hip hop artists want to fight the stereotypes of the genre by putting up a positive message in their songs.
The High Breed, a band from Bristol, claim that hip hop has moved away from its original side of the political message and away from social issues.
They wanted to go back to the market and make hip hop sound that was smart and popular.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common have been revived in the UK through acts such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black?!
NY adopter accuses her boyfriend of firing her after posting "follow-up" messages
A New York nanny is accusing her boyfriend of discrimination after she was fired for receiving a false message from another parent complaining that she was "the other black person".
The couple denied discrimination, calling the allegation "robbery".
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, was devastated to learn that their new baby sitter, Giselle Maurice, was black after arriving at work on her first day in 2016.
"Wow, you're SO excited", Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman wrote in a text message to her husband.
Instead of sending it to the man, however, he sent it to Miss Maurice, twice.
After learning of his mistake, Plasco-Flaxman "feeling uncomfortable" fired Ms. Maurice, saying the absentee foster mother, who was African American, had done a bad job and expected to see a Filipino, according to the New York Post.
Ms. Maurice was paid for one day's work and sent home in an Uber taxi.
Now, Maurice is suing his girlfriend for a severance package for her dismissal and is seeking a severance package of $350 a day for six months, despite having been offered a job he had to do, without a contract.
"I want to show you that this is the way things work", he told the Post on Friday, adding: "I know it's racist".
His co-defendants responded to the allegations of racial discrimination, saying that the expulsion of Maurice was the right thing to do, fearing that he would not be believed after he had said offensive words to him.
"My wife sent me something she shouldn't have said.
He does not make a big deal out of it.
We are not racist", Joel Plasco told the Post.
"But can you give your children to someone who said bad things to you, even though it was wrong?
Your newborn?
It is impossible".
Linking the allegation to "robbery", Plasco said his wife had been pregnant for two months and was "in a very serious condition".
"Would you find a way to track down someone like that?
It is not always the right thing to do", said the investment manager.
While the trial was ongoing, a jury quickly condemned the online lovers for their behavior and attitudes.
Paddington's publishers fear readers will not be able to relate to the universe it tells, a new letter shows
Bond's daughter Karen Jankel, born shortly after the book was approved, wrote in a letter: "It's hard to imagine someone else reading it for the first time before it's published.
It is very interesting to see how much we now know about Paddington because of his accomplishments".
He says his father, who worked for the BBC as a cameraman before he had the idea of writing children's books including a little doll, would have been a bad choice for his usual job, adding that the 60th anniversary of the book was "a mixture of joy and sorrow" after his death last year.
Of Paddington, which translates to "the most important member of our family", he added that his father was extremely proud of his unparalleled achievements.
"He was a very quiet man and he was not a boastful man".
"But because Paddington was honest, it was as if you had a child who succeeded: you were proud of him even though you didn't really do it.
I think he saw Paddington's accomplishments in that way.
Although he designed and designed it, he always gave it to Paddington himself".
My daughter was dying and I had to make a phone appointment
After being discharged, her daughter was rushed to the Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where doctors tried their best to save her life.
Ms. Ednan-Laperouseati: "Nad was constantly calling to say that things were bad and that it was expected that she would not be able to recover".
"Nad called me to tell him that he was going to die in the next two minutes and that I had to say goodbye.
And I did.
I said, "Thank you, I love you so much, my dear.
We'll be with you soon.
I will be with you.
Doctors sometimes prescribe medication to slow the heartbeat until it leaves the body.
He died prematurely and his body was completely paralyzed.
I had to sit and wait, knowing that all this was going to happen.
I could not scream or cry or cry because I was in trouble surrounded by families and people.
I had to be patient".
Then, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, now grieving over the loss of her daughter, who was on the plane with the other passengers, forgot the hardships she would have to endure.
"No one knew, " they answered.
"I nodded and cried out in tears.
It is hard to explain, but it was because of that plane that I felt deeply involved in Nad's grief.
He needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her".
Mourning women put up signs to fight the clashes on the bridge
Two women who lost loved ones to suicide would have taken steps to prevent their lives from being reborn.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have been putting up maps on the Welsh Bridge with messages that change your mind and phone numbers that people can call for help.
Ms. Davis' son Tyler, who was 13 when he began suffering from severe depression, committed suicide at age 18.
"I don't want any parent to feel the way I feel every day".
Ms. Davis, 45, who lives in Lydney, said her son was a hopeful chef who smiled so much that he attracted many.
"Everyone knew him for his smile.
They always said that his smile was the best in the room".
However, he stopped working before his death, for he was "in darkness".
In 2014, Tyler's 11-year-old sister learned that her brother had committed suicide.
"I'm still worried that it might affect you", said Ms. Davis.
Mrs. Davis left me cards, "so that people would know that there were people to go and talk to, even if they were friends.
Don't sit back and talk. You have to talk to someone".
Mrs. Humphreys, a longtime friend of Mrs. Davies, lost her 15-year-old boyfriend, Mark, just days after her mother.
"He never felt discouraged or overwhelmed by grief".
"A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his behavior.
He was upset at Christmas; he didn't look at the children or do anything when they were eating their presents".
She said that her death was a huge shock to them, but they had to find a way through: "There is a huge gap in the door.
You are overwhelmed.
But we all must persevere and keep up the fight".

Brett Kavanaugh's whereabouts remain unknown as the FBI begins its investigation
"I think, if we can get something like what we asked for, an investigation with a time frame, with a limit; it could bring us closer together", Mr. Flake said on Saturday, adding that he feared the committee was "dividing" in the face of disagreements among its members.
Why do Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to stop investigating?
Their delay is due to the timing of the event.
The midterm elections are just five weeks away, November 6, and if, as expected, Republicans are unlucky, they will be desperate to get their favorite nominee elected to the nation's highest court.
George W. Bush has received calls from senators urging him to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House for Mr. Bush and who brought him in contact with his wife Ashley, who was Mr. Bush's special assistant.
What happens next after the FBI launches its report?
Elections will be held for the 51-seat Senate, which is made up of 49 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It was unclear whether Mr. Kavanaugh would win at least 50 votes in the Senate, leaving Vice President Mike Pence with the final vote to confirm him as Chief Justice.
North Korean refugee numbers 'decreased' under Kim
The number of North Korean refugees has declined since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, according to a South Korean lawyer.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from the Korean Ministry of Foreign Affairs, said there were 1,127 refugees last year compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Park said that the strict border controls between North Korea and China and the high fees charged to smugglers of known refugees.
Pyongyang has not made any public announcements.
Many of the North Korean refugees are granted South Korean citizenship.
Seoul says more than 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border since the Korean War ended in 1953.
Many flee to China, which has the widest border with North Korea and the easiest to cross than the heavily fortified demilitarized zone between the two Koreas.
China treats these refugees as illegal immigrants rather than refugees and often forcibly returns them to their homeland.
Relations between North and South Korea, which are still at war, have been improving in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang to discuss the delayed talks on denuclearization.
It came after the June summit between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, where they agreed to work extensively to denuclearize the Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho criticized the US sanctions as no action has been taken since.
"There is no confidence in the United States that there will be confidence in the security of our countries and if there is, there is no way that we as one country can stop developing nuclear weapons first", Mr. Ri said in his speech to the United Nations General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi called Brett Kavanaugh a "slave of emotions", saying he should not be a Supreme Court justice.
Speaker Nancy Pelosi called Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh an "emotional slave" and said he was morally unfit to serve on the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made the remarks in an interview Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I can't help but wonder if a woman has ever acted in such a way, they say 'depressed,'" Pelosi said of her reception of Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh has repeatedly denied allegations that he sexually abused Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
In his opening statement, Kavanaugh was extremely emotional, as he came to shriek and groan as he spoke about his family and high school years.
He also publicly denounced the Democrats on the committee, saying the "unusual and targeted" accusations against him were made by liberals angry at Hillary Clinton's defeat in the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said she believes Kavanaugh's testimony confirmed his inability to serve as Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, because it showed he was targeting Democrats.
"I think he has taken his own position because of the way he has spoken and the way he has attacked the Clintons and the Democrats", he said.
Pelosi was hesitant when asked whether she would try to get Kavanaugh elected and whether Democrats would win a majority in the House.
"I'm going to tell you", Pelosi said, "that if he's not telling the truth to Congress or the FBI, then he shouldn't be working for the Supreme Court, but he should be working for the court where he is now".
Currently, Kavanaugh is a judge on the D.C. Court of Appeals.
Pelosi added that Democrats were concerned that Kavanaugh might challenge the Affordable Care Act in Roe v. Wade, which is seen as conservative justice.
In the conviction process, Kavanaugh sidestepped the question of whether he could overturn certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
Pelosi said, "This is no time to be a slave to emotion, a man who has a position in a courtroom and expects us to say, 'That's not right.'"
And women should wear them as a bracelet.
It's a verbal assault, months and years of anger and why he can't talk about it without crying.
"We cry when we have a problem", said Mrs. Steinem to me 45 years later.
"I don't think it's weird, does she?"
She continued: "I was greatly helped by a lady who was in charge of a place, who said that she also cried when she was angry, but she wanted a technique that worked so that when she got angry and started crying, she would tell someone she was talking to", You might think I'm upset because I'm crying.
I am furious".
He continues.
I think it's a good idea".
Tears are a natural way to vent your anger because they are often misunderstood.
One of my fondest memories of my early career, in an all-male office, where I found myself crying in an unexplained rage, was when I was grabbed on the cheek by a very old-looking man, who I would say was a rather old-looking manager, and taken to the nursery.
"Don't let them see you cry", he said.
"They don't know you're drunk.
They think you are unhappy, and they are happy that they listened to you".
Patricia Schroeder, a Democratic congresswoman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart in his campaign.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught having an affair on the Monkey Business and immediately withdrew from the race, Mrs. Schroeder, who was furious, knew that there was no reason why she should not give up the idea of running for president herself.
"It was not a well-thought-out decision", he said with a laugh 30 years later.
"There were seven other candidates in the race and one they didn't want at all was another candidate.
Someone called it "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs".
Because it would be a late campaign, he was behind in fundraising efforts and decided that he would never run unless those who managed to raise 2 million US dollars.
It was a battle he could not win.
He learned that some of his supporters had given $1,000 to men who could only give him $250.
"Do they think I'm cheap?" she asked herself.
When he gave his speech announcing that he might not run publicly, he was overwhelmed with emotion, thanked his supporters, resented the administration's approach that made it harder for him to raise money and reach voters than it was for his representatives, and was caught off guard by the class-based discrimination.
"You thought I might be overwhelmed by stress", recalled Mrs. Schroeder of the way the lightning struck her.
"You thought Kleenex was a financial company.
I remember thinking about it, what would be written on my grave?
"Did He Cry?"'
How can U.S.-China trade be a good thing for Beijing
The two-pronged US-China trade war has been a distraction and if the war is not resolved, the tensions between the two countries could be in Beijing's long-term interest, experts say.
Donald Trump, the US President, was the first to impose tariffs on Chinese imports including solar panels, steel and aluminum earlier this year.
The consensus was most pronounced this week with the introduction of new tariffs affecting $200 billion worth of goods, resulting in almost half of all imports from China to the United States being taxed.
Beijing has responded in a similar fashion, recently raising tariffs from five to 10 percent on $60 billion worth of goods.
China is committed to combining the efforts of the US, the world's second largest economy, and is unlikely to fail.
Making Washington retreat means demands, but publicly bending over to the United States would be extremely embarrassing for Xi Jinping, the Chinese president.
And experts still say that if Beijing does well, the pressure of a trade war with the US could help China in the long run by reducing its rivalry with the two major economies.
"A quick political decision by either Washington or Beijing could set the direction for a change of direction on both sides that would be as bad for the war watchers as they've previously admitted", said Abigail Grace, an associate Asia researcher at the Center for New American Security, which is composed of a team of experts.
Syria 'ready' to welcome returning refugees, says foreign minister
Syria says it is ready to welcome the refugees and is seeking help to rebuild the country, which has been ravaged by more than seven years of war.
Speaking to the European Union General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said that the situation in the country is improving.
"Today, the situation in the country is peaceful and secure due to the steps taken against terrorism".
The government continues to resettle some areas that were devastated by the rebels in order to restore normal life.
All directives are in place for refugees who wish to voluntarily return to their country of origin because terrorism and unfair economic policies are affecting their livelihoods and daily lives.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
Another six million people live in the country in need of humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem says the Syrian government welcomes everyone in rebuilding the war-torn country.
But he insisted that he could not accept help from countries that had encouraged independence.
Europe wins Ryder Cup in Paris
Team Europe won the 2018 Ryder Cup by defeating Team USA in the final by a score of 16.5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National outside Paris, France.
The United States has now lost six straight on European soil and has not won a Ryder Cup tournament in Europe since 1993.
Europe regained the crown when the Danish team captained by Thomas Bjorn reached the 14.5 points required to beat the United States.
American Phil Mickelson, who was very disappointed with the competition, threw his ball into the water on the 3rd hole of the 16th, losing his game to Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari won the all-around, becoming the first golfer in history to go 5-0-0 since the current tournament began in 1979.
American Jordan Spieth lost 5&4 to European Thorbjorn Olesen of Denmark.
World number one Dustin Johnson won 2 games to 1 and was beaten by England's Ian Poulter who may have played his last Ryder Cup match.
A former Ryder Cup player, Spanishman Sergio Garcia became the tournament's leading scorer with 25.5 points in his career.
"I don't usually cry, but today I'm fine.
It was a big year.
I am so grateful that Thomas chose me and put his trust in me.
I am so happy, so happy that I have returned the cup.
It's about the team and I'm happy that I was able to help", Garcia said with a lot of emotion after winning the European championships.
He left behind fellow countryman John Ram, who beat American golfer Tiger Woods 2 sets to 1 in Sunday's singles.
"The undeniable pride of beating Tiger Woods, I grew up watching", said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost his last four matches in France and is now down 13-21-3 in his Ryder Cup appearances.
The amazing statistic is that one of the greatest players of all time, who won 14 major titles, is second only to Jack Nicklaus.
The American team struggled all weekend to find a fair chance to match Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played golf at the highest level in all competitions.
Team USA captain Jim Furyk said after a disappointing performance for his team, "I am not proud of the players, they fought as hard as they could.
This morning, we sometimes put pressure on the European team.
We split up.
We are very grateful to Thomas.
He is a good captain.
All 12 of his players played well.
We'll come together as a team, I'll try to get to the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup Committee and we'll go far.
I love those 12 players and am proud to be their captain.
You should consult your captain.
We played more".
Red tide updates: Red tide prevalence is declining in Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota
New reports from the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission indicate a general decline in the prevalence of red-tailed deer in Tampa Bay areas.
According to the FWC, active players would be reported in parts of Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier counties; meaning there was a decrease in focus on the game.
The positive Red Tide effect added nearly 210 miles of sandy beaches from the northern end of Pinellas to the southern end of Lee County.
The sites can be found within 25 kilometers of the coastline of Hillsborough County, but few sites have been identified in the past week.
A red wave was also observed in Pasco County.
Equal prevalence in or near Pinellas County was observed in the past week, low and high prevalence in Hillsborough County, high prevalence in Manatee County, with a high prevalence in or near Sarasota County, low prevalence in Charlotte County, low prevalence in and around Lee County and high prevalence in Collier County.
The respiratory problem continues to be reported in Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Lee and Collier counties.
Respiratory problems were not reported in northwest Florida during the past week.
