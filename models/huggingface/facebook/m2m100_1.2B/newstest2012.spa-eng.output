Parliament rejects amendment to release Tymoshenko
The parliament of Ukraine has rejected the proposal to repeal the amendment to the section of the Criminal Code in which the opposition leader Yulia Tymoshenko is convicted.
The amendment would open the doors to the excarceration of the former prime minister, but parliamentarians rejected the proposal to reduce the penalties for economic crimes in the second reading.
In October, Tymoshenko was sentenced to seven years in prison for allegedly signing an agreement with Russia unfavorable to Ukraine on the purchase of natural gas.
The verdict is not yet firm, the Court of Appeal has the obligation to review it in December.
Tymoshenko was convinced that this was a political revenge of the regime, and even in the West there have been doubts about the impartiality of the court.
The proposal to withdraw paragraph 365 of the Criminal Code, which sentenced the former prime minister, was supported by 147 MPs in the vote.
226 votes were needed to be approved.
The Victory of Libya
The history of Libyan liberation, or of the Libyan rebellion, already has its losers.
Muammar al-Gaddafi was buried in a secret place in the desert and without him there is no more war.
It remains to be determined who is the winner.
As is already customary in the region, the Islamists won the elections, but now it is a matter of clarifying whether it is moderate or radical.
The National Transitional Council has put into force the traditional law, Sharia, which we already know in a way.
Libya will become a country without crime, because the thieves will be cut off.
Women can already forget to emancipate themselves and the apostates wait for their execution and so on.
Instead of by the person of the dictator, society, composed of warrior tribes, will be united by the Quran.
In Libya, an order will be established that we cannot even imagine and that we cannot.
However, our way of life is neither the only nor objectively the best and probably did not suit the already mentioned Libyans.
The truth is that it is surprising that Islamic fighters accepted the help of unfaithful dogs with gratitude.
The only justification was that, from their point of view, the NATO attacks were not directed by an American general, but great be Allah, whose greatness they celebrated after each of the successful interventions.
When winners are sought in Libya, the West is not among them.
We are trapped in a shooting that is used by Islamists and our politicians to get rid of a dictator in the person of a political ally with no guarantees of profit.
After recent bad experiences in Afghanistan and Iraq, we do not occupy Libya militarily.
In this case, the locals do not have a problem expelling the "crucified"
But, without occupation, will the oil companies be able to make Libya’s black gold with just good words?
It is quite possible that not, but it may be that eventually the West can presume to protect human rights.
As long as the followers of Sharia do not cross us.
A new era of crisis begins.
France and the rest of Europe go on the hunt for investors
Statistical turmoil has spread across Europe
Individual countries have released their GDP data for Q3.
The Czech economy in the inter-quarter period has stagnated, while France and Germany have grown.
However, the bond market today has broken records.
Investors are no longer fixed only in Italy, but also in Spain, France, Austria and others.
The Eurozone statistics offices, Germany, the Czech Republic and other European countries, have already published their preliminary estimates on economic growth in the third quarter.
Germany’s GDP grew by 0.5% and France by 0.4%
Both countries have made public the data for the second quarter, in Germany it has improved more than expected (growth of 0.3% instead of the expected 0.1%), although in France it gave a slight reduction of 0.1% (the original data spoke of stagnation).
The Czech economy grew annually by 1.5% in the third quarter of this year.
However, in the inter-quarter period, gross domestic product (GDP) has stalled and according to the ČSÚ the trend to gradual slowdown in growth of economic development is formed.
The results are even worse than analysts predicted.
The main events:
Inter-yearly, the Czech economy grew in the third quarter of this year by 1.5%, but quarterly it has stagnated.
In the third quarter, the German economy, according to preliminary and seasonally recalculated data, grew by 0.5%.
The economy of the Eurozone and also of the European Union, between July and September and compared to the previous quarter, grew by 0.2%, which is in line with analyst expectations.
The Greek economy has declined by 5.2 per cent.
The interest rate on its 10-year bonds is 28.45%.
Interest in Italian and Spanish bonds has grown to critical limits.
The problematic situation begins to affect Austria, the Netherlands, France, Belgium, etc.
The interest rates on the 10-year Czech bonds remain at 4%, although in the area the situation is worsening.
In Germany there are voices that say the ECB should ultimately grant loans.
The Czechs qualify for the Euro.
They won 1:0 and celebrated the ranking with a 200 million bonus.
The football team is performing the most difficult task of the whole season!
In Montenegro, thanks to the excellent Čech and brilliant goalkeeper Petr Jiráček, the victory was given by 1:0.
The Czech team, along with a good dose of luck in the second half, defended fantastically against the attacks of the local team, so that it will not miss the European championship appointment.
IHNED.cz followed the development of the party in detail in a detailed report.
There was almost no excitement in the first half and a good dose of luck in the second.
The Czech team, thanks to the collapse of the local team towards the final, and also to the excellent game of Čech and the heroic Jiráček, defeated 1:0 in Montenegro and celebrates its pass to the European Championship.
Due to the correct Czech defense, the Montenegro did not press until the second half.
The two losers of the match were Damjanovič and Vučinič, who left two big occasions to pass.
In addition, thanks to the brilliant Petr Čech, the Czech eleven will not miss the European Cup, so that the national football treasures will get an approximate gratification of 200 million crowns.
In the first few minutes we played a good offensive game.
Both teams strive only to keep the lines and play nothing else around the center of the field.
There was no pressure from the local players in the first half, patches to the other field in defense, just what the Czech defense knew how to avoid.
Iranian students are ready to die for their country’s nuclear program.
They formed a human shield.
Several hundred university students have formed human shields around nuclear facilities in Iran.
With their gesture they want to express their support for their country’s nuclear program in the face of a possible Israeli attack.
Students began praying at noon in front of the facilities on Tuesday and then choreographed death slogans to the US and Israel.
Several hundred university students formed human shields around the nuclear technology center in the Iranian city of Isfahan on Tuesday.
They want to show that they are willing to defend their country’s nuclear program with their own lives.
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), in a recent report, found that Iran, according to all indications, is striving to acquire nuclear weapons.
Israel is talking about a possible attack on Iranian nuclear facilities.
Students began praying at noon in front of the Isfahan nuclear facilities and then threw death slogans against the US and Israel.
In the event of an attack, the aim of which would be to paralyze the Iranian nuclear program, it would be reached, according to Israeli sources, not only the Isfahan plant, but also the facilities of Natanz, where uranium is enriched.
Daily menu of an obese child: no breakfast and dinner embedded
More than a third of children aged 9 to 13 have overweight problems, with overweight affecting 9% of the school population and obesity at 5%.
Obese children mostly come from families with an unhealthy lifestyle, according to current research.
It again demonstrates the importance of the environment where you grow for a healthy development of the person, as well as the models that serve as a reference.
At the table, obsessive children are fed, for example, of bottles at least twice as often as children from families with a normal weight.
For dinner, more than 19% of the obese had dined fried potatoes the day before the analysis, which is linked to the “Obesity is not a coincidence” prevention program.
In families with overweight children there is no habit of playing sports, which is applicable to most current families, where only 15% of children responded that their parents, at least once a week, find time for physical exercise.
A survey of 900 children
The survey was conducted at the end of last school year and involved almost 900 children in elementary education from all over the Czech Republic.
It was the second edition of the program "Obesity is not a coincidence", which supports the General Health Insurance Company and the company Unilever.
So far, more than 12,000 children from 4th to 8th grade have participated in the project.
A proper diet and enough exercise in the family are determining factors, which make the number of children with overweight and even obesity decrease notably.
"Only half of the children surveyed have responded that they have five meals daily according to the regime: breakfast, lunch, food, snack and dinner, which is one of the basic conditions for a healthy diet," one of the results of the survey.
No breakfast, but with dinner.
Specialists warn that, in a healthy development, details are also important, which also count, such as having a fixed time for breakfast in the family.
In the Czech Republic, however, only 23% of school families eat breakfast at the same time.
Most families eat breakfast alone.
But the worst was discovering that in 10% of households there is no breakfast.
Breakfast is the basis of a proper daily diet.
The study shows that in the families of obese children are consumed much more frequently insane fried potatoes.
Nearly everyone – regardless of weight – drinks daily sweets (70%).
As a rule, more than 40% of the children surveyed do sports, however, among their parents this result is reduced to less than half, only 15%.
Create your diet
The next phase of the study made it possible for the chosen guys (204 boys and 172 girls from 13 schools) to create their own diets from all possible offers according to their tastes and opinions.
“The food preferences of Czech children aged between 12 and 15 years, from the point of view of healthy eating, are far from ideal.”
Among his favorite foods are pasta, meat and sweets.
“It’s especially alarming the popularity of sweets,” the study’s final report said.
As the main meal, the palm is taken with the pasta and followed closely by the bird meat.
Practically, children always reject legumes and the taste for fish and vegetables is very low.
Change to healthy habits
At the same time, the study shows that children are willing to change their eating habits if they are given the right information.
“In the control group of the participants in the study, who filled out the questionnaire after finishing the prevention program “Obesity is not a coincidence”, a major change was made in many cases in favour of the principles of healthy eating,” the study finds.
It calls attention, for example, to the relating to sweets, where many children would start to prefer normal, running water.
Children would also choose more frequently in the questionnaire poultry meat and fish for the main meal and would restrict the consumption of sweet food and flour derivatives.
The stylist must also be a good psychologist, the professionals argue
In the introductory article, How stylists learn, I already complained a bit that the initial lessons were already quite loaded.
I had no idea how that would go.
Lectures from three industry professionals, how to dress problematic characters and, in addition, a seminar on how it works in the world of the show.
And it will be worse.
The closer the final exams are, the more information and practical tasks await us.
And although the course takes place every Saturday and Sunday, there is no longer a pitch.
We once studied with the director, Alena, (in the course there is no man) on how to dress the woman who does not have a perfect symmetry.
And so is the vast majority.
Someone is neckline, someone has a stylized figure without the right curves and someone suffers from overweight.
The stylist must know how to optically soften a wide shoulder, extend a neck or recreate the necessary curves.
We have given certain tricks on how to highlight the body of women like Jennifer Lopez, with huge breasts and hips but narrow waist and at the same time not dressing her too challengingly.
If, for example, the difference between waist and hip is so much that the shirt or pants don’t fit, it’s worth sewing at least an extra piece of fabric on your own.
They will not regret it, because the clothes that fit perfectly are priceless.
With a tailor-made fist you will feel much better than with one that doesn’t stop moving, standing up, dancing on the waist, etc.
The stylized body can be allowed to wear clothes with folds, ornaments, browsing or drapeage.
There are many different types of information and bodies, so I’m glad that I have the entire week to put all this information in order in my head.
And even so, I fear that with the assigned task, I already have more than enough.
Each participant in the course has been assigned two celebrities, who must design two dressing rooms: one for the day and another for the night.
It is necessary to take into account the current aspect, the fashion style that suits the person in question.
I’ve been touching Miranda Kerr, maybe you know her from the Victoria’s Secret campaign.
I scream inside, for me it’s much better than, for example, Britney Spears or Christina Aguilera, who has recently gained about a hundred kilos (please consider the exaggeration), or the youthful Selena Gomez.
We have to cut them off from magazines or search for them on the internet and print them, to then elaborate them graphically.
The moodboard, which is what is called the full result, also expresses our personal style and our relationship with graphic design.
It is also important to think about the graphic part of stylism.
The stylist, therefore, does not only wear physically, but also deals, for example, with product pages in magazines (of specific topics, such as trends, bags, coats, etc.).
This was by designer and designer Mario Kameník.
All of this remains for Sunday.
The designer needs to have a global vision.
The three guest specialists animated Saturday’s conference with information on all types of bodies.
Stylist Honza Pokorný, fashion designer Jakub Polanka and fashion photographer Ben Renč.
Jakub reminded us that fashion is an illusion and the stylist should know how to take advantage of this.
And a good stylist knows how to work with the same garment in different ways.
Variability is crucial in this case.
Thus, such a shirt (or as they say in English, trench-coat) can be dressed to the classic with cowboys and t-shirt, but it also serves to dress the naked body with heels and photograph it as if it were actually a dress.
Or just roll it off and raise the neck to get a completely different image.
“Play with it,” he insisted.
What I value most is the following advice: “To start working, you must first know all the rules.”
“Then you can break them,” said Jakub.
Finally, it becomes clear to me why we memorize all those formulas, what is combined with what, why, if then it turns out that in fashion magazines we find different results.
Not to mention the parades.
Thanks to photographer Ben, I know that a stylist has to have more types of clothes in the reserve than he intends to photograph.
So, for a fashion story that has ten pages (therefore, ten outfits), you have to have prepared, ready to wear, at least fifteen.
And in addition to the photos the clothes work in combination with other clothes, all of them different from those used in reality.
This should be taken into account when designing the outfit.
Honza Pokorný assured us that image and style alone, in many cases, are half the success.
Just look at Madonna, who is not exactly an extraordinary singer, but her image and brand have made her a world star.
In the Czech Republic, at the moment, there is still no clear trend to use the services of stylists.
Even famous characters also find it useless (my skills are enough, my physical appearance is not so important).
And when someone asks us for our services, we must keep in mind that it is very likely that they will indicate a size very different from their real (minor).
Then it only remains to guggle and find out if the heart magazines have already written on the subject, if a certain celebrity has gained weight/weight, etc.
On Sunday, Honza and Mario insisted that the stylist does not have to focus on fashion, but has to understand outfits.
During your work, you should primarily communicate with the people you see, so it is important to be a good psychologist.
He knows how to value people, does not miss them, defends their opinions.
“When a director hired you to classify her dressing room and complete it with beautiful clothes, you can’t pick up and throw everything and say, ‘What a horror.’
“Find at least a couple of things you can consider and recommend so someone can put them on,” says Mario.
He himself also showed us that everything should fit in the so-called "placovka", that is, the work bag.
This is fixed around the waist and all the necessary tools are there.
There are also nailon wire (which serves the stylist during the photo session of products such as bags or hats), special clutches for clutching of garments in front, if it was larger (the clutches and other types of clutches are not allowed, because they could damage the fabric), or a sewing game.
In order not to stay in the passive listening and put something into practice, we have learned to dress the soles of the shoes.
Even during the photo sessions in the studio, on a flat surface, the sol could be damaged and much more the exterior.
And we did nothing but dress and dress.
We could not touch the shoes with the tiles so as not to accidentally damage them.
He had to be very skilled.
Mario has given me a joy by praising my work unreservedly.
I don’t get those skills very well.
This is just a small fraction of what we’ve heard throughout the weekend, in the second part of the course.
I’ve already realized that engaging in stylism at a professional level is not a way of rose, but I don’t care exactly what people say.
Need for Speed: The Run runs across the United States.
reviewed
A journey, in principle careless, is complicated by a series of improper negligence of a routine trip during tomorrow’s turn.
To a certain extent, it was able to meet expectations, but that serves nothing, if, in reality, nothing extraordinary was intended to be done.
The new episode, to which the title is added The Run, aroused great expectations already before its premiere.
It promised that it would give new airs to the old race saga Need for Speed and, as a result of what was shown, appears as a game that should not end up being once again an action genre without more.
We also felt curious to know how the inserted scenes would be, where the main character descends from the car and walks on his own foot.
As often happens in the NFS series, the results do not vary much from what we expected.
There are races that can be given for acceptable, but in the total calculation you lose points due to absurd failures, which have already appeared in the series for years.
In reality they cannot even be called errors, but rather the incomprehensible deception of programmers.
The adventure starts very well.
You are introduced to a story, whose protagonist, Jack, has certain personal problems; to solve them, he is offered to participate in an illegal race across America.
You sit at the wheel on the west coast, in San Francisco, and your mission is to get the first to New York.
The idea is to offer something interesting.
The route is divided into ten stages and then into more than fifty races.
From this it is deduced that each race takes place by a different route and the stages are located in different environments, which are quite diverse and interesting.
Thus, one does not even remotely have the feeling that the game always offers the same thing.
Some of the environments are even pleasant to see, although the technical level of the graph is equivalent to that of previous deliveries of the series.
It is nothing of the other world.
But walking through the desert, the autumn landscape or the high snow-covered mountains produce a very pleasant visual effect.
In addition, races are diversified from time to time by an atypical element.
So, for example, in the desert you find a sandstorm that diminishes visibility.
Instead, be careful in the mountains so that you are not buried by an avalanche.
According to this, each of the races is very well developed.
There are only a couple of models, but that’s enough.
For a moment, you try to advance a required number of rivals (as is normal in a classic race), then you try to win time (classic duel timed) and then you are waiting for a duel against a single opponent.
In the midst of all this sometimes appears the police, which does not do but make things even more difficult.
The main feature is landscapes outside the car.
Interactive animations are presented when Jack, in most cases, has to escape from someone and you have to help him, always pressing the button right at the right time.
Nothing complicated.
It is surprising, however, that there are far fewer landscapes in the game than you could expect (in particular there are only three).
But the end result is positive, because this element does not get annoying and, in the context already mentioned, is one of the elements that make the game more interesting.
The driving model follows the footprints of previous episodes.
That means that today it is no longer a big thing, but it cannot be said to be bad.
If you are looking for a realistic simulation, you can look elsewhere.
But for a race conceived with a lot of action this style of driving is quite suitable, although we can find something better among the competition games.
So far, everything is in order.
Problems arise after a while.
Unlike the correct driving models, it is no longer the same with collisions.
From games of this type you can’t expect to recreate complicated deformations and collisions, but in fact before a hit against any object, you can’t predict how your car will react, with which not everything is in order.
It is typical that, by making a very adjusted advance or driving the car with normal traffic, there are only slight scratches, but in other almost identical situations, your car ends up making uncontrolled piruettes.
Or even completely destroyed.
Thanks to the reset system, no big problems arise, but it can put you in a bad mood.
Resets are programmed in such a way that, when you suffer an accident or leave the track, the game restores you to the last rescue point on the track.
However, in each race only five resets are available.
If you consume them all, you have to restart the race from the beginning.
So it is nothing more than a help in case something goes wrong, but it is not very reliable.
Sometimes, reset does not help, it only helps to learn the given stage of memory.
A major disadvantage of the game is that the same facts are repeated in different places.
In some curves, for example, you have to enter in a specific way; otherwise, they are impossible to take.
Other times you find somewhere "civil" vehicles always with the same configuration, even if you are the first, fifth or you arrive five minutes before or after.
This makes you rage especially in situations, when you see that two cars that go to the meeting in opposite directions, your opponent advances without problems, but when you arrive, you have to turn or brake.
It doesn’t matter when you arrive, because it’s programmed so that the “surprise” will always happen in front of your nose.
The opponents also have an advantage.
During the whole game you will get to places where, regardless of the moment, you will always be ahead of the same opponent in the same place.
In addition, this happens at the end of the game, on a long bridge, which is even more shocking.
Your opponent must come before you, at any cost.
When it goes in front of you, it makes it difficult for you to see the cars that come in front of you, so at first you can scratch the car.
You can understand the idea of creating a game with maximum doses of suspense and adrenaline, but the execution is so apparent that it will disappoint you immediately.
And it’s a pity, because even though the model of the trip is simple, the game is fun and with action, so it’s often not possible to follow in detail what happens or where.
And it doesn’t really matter, whether the merit takes the idea with fifty exclusive tracks or the ranking in the race so that you don’t get bored, or anything else.
An unusual idea is the change of cars during races.
You have to pay attention to the gasoline supplies next to the road, because right there you have to change your car, although in the vast majority of cases it will be enough for you to have what you have.
Cars are divided into three categories.
Sports cars are suitable for urban areas, American heavy cars for straight highways and exotic super sports for technical driving, for example, on curved mountain roads.
In addition to the main narrative thread, there is also a parallel thread of challenges, that is, there are races in specific places that you will know from the stories.
Here you will get not only medals, but also experience points for your profile, which serves both for challenges and stories.
By reaching the upper level, the driver is opened several possibilities, starting with the car and ending with funds for the profile.
At the same time, an online Autolog feature is connected, which compares your results with those of other players and provides other community features.
One of the most difficult elements to understand is how the last race in history is made.
With the car you get to the metro tunnel (pass), where you start running in the dark by the roads (pass).
The speed meter marks you between 150 and 200 km/h (pass) and, suddenly, the subway convoy comes behind you and takes you forward.
In the editorial we will have a discussion about this for several days, about whether during the programming of the game no one even thought a little or if the authors really take us for a panda of fools.
The technical part of the game is nothing extraordinary, but at least the overall visual effects result in most cases pleasant, sometimes even superb.
It is a pity that, in the most tense moments, the quality of the image is reduced and, sometimes, in a serious way.
This especially affects accidents where many participants are involved, when continuous image quality is no longer valid.
The audio is fine and the soundtrack is a matter of taste.
In order to please the majority of the youth group, the soundtrack belongs to the category "each of his father and his mother", but it can be assumed that no one would buy the game just for his music.
The final feeling of Need for Speed: The Run is therefore rather confusing.
If the game avoided absolutely stupid mistakes, we would have trouble claiming that The Run is the best NFS game of the last few years.
It feels like the game is not over.
Fun is guaranteed, but be prepared because mistakes will hit you in the eyes with the force of airport reflectors.

Ambassador to the EU, Vicenová:
The Czechs have a reputation of negativists and eurosceptics.
“The Lisbon Treaty has significantly affected the balance between the individual institutions.”
“I didn’t expect a war without a headquarters.”
"It will take five, six years before the situation stabilizes a little, it calms down and the new players get used to their new roles," the Czech ambassador to the EU, Milena Vicenová, began her lecture with conviction at the Faculty of Law.
How not to take his motto "clear and open about Europe" seriously, which he said already in the first part of his conference, when he managed to describe each EU body and its relations with such accuracy and clarity, since it would be the envy of many lecturers of the Faculty of Law of U. Carolina.
Vicenová also commented on the work of the new permanent President of the European Council, Herman van Rompuy:
"First of all, criticisms arise, that if he is insulting, a gray official, able to assume any role, but I have to say that he left everyone confused, because he assumes his roles to perfection."
"He is a man who knows how to listen to the members of the twenty-seven states, communicate with them and who has a very clear vision of where the EU should go."
The new position of Foreign and Security Policy Representative is explained from the question: "Who is this EU? what number can I call it?" It is therefore an important step towards the unification and clarification of the political union in the face of states such as China or India.
No one wants to ban Olomouc cheese.
Vicenová has also dealt with the agenda followed, follows and will follow the European Council in the near future.
The Czech presidency two years ago was a success.
The Czechs dealt with the emerging economic crisis, resolved the gas crisis and organized a summit for the Eastern Partnership.
The fall of the government at that time was identified as a very negative aspect, which seriously affected the Czech Republic.
The Czech representation in the EU currently has many commitments.
In the words of the ambassador: “a good storm,” not only the presidency, but also the financial crisis, which is being dealt with now.
On the other hand, it is necessary to approve the seven-year budget of the EU, caused by the current, much more complicated economic situation.
If the budget is simpler and more effective, which sectors will have priority, which countries will receive more support and which countries will get less?
The ambassador also recalled her main motto, with which she arrived in Europe: “About Europe with clarity.”
“The truth is, I don’t like ugly abbreviations, outsiders, or jargons that people don’t understand.”
“How can a citizen understand that in Brussels they don’t really invent the cucumbers, the curved or round cucumbers, bananas of various sizes, or that no one is going to ban Olomouc cheese?”
It also aims to take more advantage of the EU environment and bring more Czech citizens closer to the European institutions.
The Europe of Speed
According to the ambassador, the Czechs have a reputation for being eurosceptic and people perceive the negative aspects rather than the positive.
In addition, he regretted the low participation of Czechs in the European institutions.
The blame is on a multitude of factors, such as the modesty of our candidates, their inability to write motivational messages, but also the little support of the Czechs.
In addition to the success of the Czech presidency, he highlighted the strength and collaboration of the Visegrad Group.
“Believe me, when a Polish and a Hungarian come to me and a Slovak approaches me, a Frenchman next to me says, ‘What, have you stayed, the members of the Visegrad Group?’
In the future, the EU, according to Vicenová, awaits new rigorous regulations of budgetary policy for Member States.
It is perceived as something very real of the concept of the two speeds, if not more, in Europe, more than the new "European Federation".
“We have countries in the Eurozone and countries outside the Eurozone.”
“We have the Schengen area and we also have the procedure for enhanced cooperation.”
"It was said for the first time that only countries that want to cooperate and those that don't, that they stay out."
“These procedures will be more and more and will strengthen the two-speed Europe,” Vicenová expects.
In this sense, he also highlighted the role of the Czech Republic and Herman van Rompuy in the implementation of the principle, according to which all issues affecting the whole of the EU should be debated among the member states, not just among the members of the Eurozone.
The Brand Story:
IBM begins its second century of existence
If someone sought a term that defined IBM’s strategy with great precision, the most approximate would be “long-term”.
For the general public, IBM is the symbol of a technological revolution, a company that is perceived as current and, however, has already passed a hundred years since its foundation.
The basis of this long-time character was laid by the company’s first head, the visionary Thomas J. Watson Sr.
He has already coined the motto that many problems in the world have a solution if people are willing to think.
Its motto "Think!" became its seal, around which it will be constructing the life of the future giant (it was also the title of an internal magazine that IBM began to publish in 1935).
Watson was also the foundation of a carefully erected corporate culture.
“For us, IBM implies long-term thinking, a continuous move towards the future.
IBM has survived and flourished for a hundred years for that reason, because it remained faithful to its basic principles, but without fear of the changes around.
That has allowed us, during our first century, to transform technology, business and society.
We hope to thrive even more in our second century,” said Samuel J. Palmisano, the company’s current director, during his anniversary.
A sophisticated system
Watson, already in the 1930s, was concerned with the care of his employees as the entrepreneur of Baťa in the Czech Republic (IBM employees were among the first American operators to enjoy paid vacations, insurance, elegant uniforms and a sophisticated remuneration system that rewarded the best inventors and sellers.
The same long-term sophistication isined by IBM in the customer relationship.
From the beginning the company knew how to discover talents (by being one of the first global companies to eliminate any type of discrimination, it could choose without problems).
In the line of the anti-discrimination strategy is IBM’s current plan, by which Palmisano will be replaced next year by a woman: Virginia Rometty.
She has worked for thirty years at IBM, where she has been head of sales, marketing and strategies.
Over the past few years, IBM has participated in the so-called virtual encounters, online rain of ideas, from which endless future strategies and innovations arise.
It is not surprising that ideas are overwhelming, as the firm employs almost half a million people.
An institution with a good reputation
The firm position in the business provides the company with a strong internal and external image.
“From the beginning, IBM hasined a concept of institution rather than technology company,” says Rosabeth Moss Kanter, a Harvard Business School professor of economics and author of the book on IBM.
“IBM is not a technology company, but a company that tries to solve business problems for technology users,” said George Colony of Forrester Research.
As the company itself says, there is a difference between entering a business and directly creating a business.
IBM – or the “Gran Verde” – as it is known in the U.S. familiarly because of its logo, has become in the last hundred years one of the largest companies in the world.
It is possibly the most versatile technology company (it develops both equipment as well as programs, infrastructures and web hosting services within a wide range of services, ranging from servers to nanotechnology).
It holds the largest number of patents of all U.S. technology companies and five of its employees have received the Nobel Prize.
Among his inventions are the ATM, payment cards, financial switches, barcodes and disquets.
This year, IBM has become the second technology firm by market capitalization (the first is Apple), when it first surpassed Microsoft in 1996.
Looking to the future
Not all products and innovations just satisfy the taste of customers and the moment (IBM did not bet on its own operating system, OS/2, Prodigy online services or IBM PCjr computers).
“If your business is based on moving forward, you can’t emotionally anchor yourself into the past,” said Samuel J. Palmisano.
Therefore, IBM has no problems building its bases on other platforms (and equally, if they don’t work, it abandons them).
And that’s the difference from the competition, Microsoft, which basically remains and always falls exclusively with Windows.
Technology of the Future
In terms of sales, IBM is mainly dedicated to services, of which approximately one-fifth is software and another-fifth is equipment.
However, even in 1990 teams represented more than half of the share of suppliers.
As of 2000, IBM has sold low-performing assets for a total value of $15 billion, and during the same period, it has invested $58 billion in the purchase of future technology.
Investments have continued since 2008, when the modern global financial crisis first emerged.
IBM acts according to the premises of its first chief, Thomas J. Watson, who during the great economic crisis of the 29th increased investments.
It seems that so far IBM has managed to overcome the crisis.
The value of IBM shares since the beginning of the year 2008 has grown stratospherically to 120%, the company’s net profit has not stopped increasing.
IBM’s currency is to change everything except its value.
It can therefore be expected that when the next crisis comes, this flexible giant will withstand.
IBM’s History: From Cheese Cutter to Space Flights
The company IBM (International Business Machines) was founded in New York 100 years ago, being its original name Computing Tabulating Recording Corporation.
The name IBM was adopted in 1924 – originally it was a brand used in Canadian and South American branches.
The foundation that led to the birth of IBM arises from the merger of four companies that date back to the 1880s.
He had inventions such as the famous "check clock", which allows to control the entry and exit of employees.
The architect of the new company was businessman Charles Ranlett Flint, who until 1930 also chaired its supervisory board.
Flint hired the head of a competing company, Thomas J. Watson, to help him with the management of the company.
The new leader eclipsed IBM’s founder (Watson’s ideas remain the firm foundation on which corporate culture and identity are based).
Watson led the company until 1952.
IBM, as its name suggests, began with the production and sale of all kinds of business appliances, from meat and cheese cutting machines to cash.
During the first four years that Watson led the company, revenue doubled to $9 million and the company began to expand across continents.
Watson was so crucial to the company that, almost after forty years occupying the chair of the boss, he was replaced by his son, Thomas Watson Junior.
Under his direction, IBM began working on the development of artificial intelligence and developed the first programming language.
In the 1960s IBM staff and computers helped NASA guide flights to space (to Mercury, Saturn and in 1969 the famous flight to the Moon).
In 1964, IBM developed the first generation of computers, the IBM System/360 series.
The classic "pieces", which established the standard of computers of that time, came to the market under the name of IBM 5150 in 1981.
Twenty years later, IBM sold its computer production to the Chinese company Lenovo, which, in turn, acquired the consulting part of the company Pricewaterhouse Coopers and began to offer comprehensive advisory and high value-added services.
The strategy that IBM has paid for these last three years is the concept of Smarter Planet, that is, “a smarter planet.”
Its aim is to make a more rational use of technology, although the areas have not yet been planned or the circumstances have improved, for example, in relation to transport and city administration.
For the trade sector, IBM introduced not long ago the "Smart Commerce" platform that allows retailers to manage the entire business cycle.
IBM has a long history in this country.
In 1932 it opened a branch in then-Czechoslovakia, the first country to have it in Central and Eastern Europe.
Today, IBM ČR also operates its strategic outsourcing centre in Brno.
The headquarters for Central and Eastern Europe is in Prague.Here is also a world-renowned research team that works with voice recognition.
Rychtářová about her unfaithful husband:
Stay with that ass, I don’t want it anymore!
Darina Rychtářová (53) said it is over!
After her husband Josef Rychtář (53) became the only protector of Iveta Bartošová (45), but also her lover, Darina continued to have the hope that Josef would wake up from his pink dream and return home.
However, he will no longer wait and has set clear rules for life in the future.
“Pepe can go home, but not as my partner anymore,” Rychtářová said.
When Darina Rychtářová welcomed Bartošové in her home during the summer, she could not even imagine how her marriage would end.
Despite the request, Iveta had not moved thirty days after Říčany and Pepe did not abandon the singer.
He even declared publicly that he loved her.
Over time, Darina resigned, apparently accepted her husband’s relationship and even said goodbye to him forever.
Rychytář doesn’t care who his wife sleeps with.
If one day Rychtář broke up with Bartošová, his wife would not wait for him at home with open arms.
He is the biological father of my children and, if he wants to live the rest of his life in our house, no one will throw him away.”
"But here I would live no longer as my beloved old man who made a mistake, but as a man to whom I am bound by certain ties," Rychtářová said, adding that she had already separated herself from her husband and insisted only on mutual respect.
To Josef until now it doesn’t matter that his wife has closed the back door to him.
“I accept my wife’s decision.”
“I will be with Iveta and there is no change possible.”
"My wife established this as a marriage on paper and I respect it."
“The company is still in place, I do the house arrangements, I take care of the garden, the home, I do the shopping.”
“Darina and I talked to each other normally, the only thing is that we don’t share a bed,” Rychtář said.
If Rychtářová found a new love, he would not oppose.
"We don't sleep together and she doesn't care about me, nor where she goes or if she has a boyfriend.
I know it’s my fault, I fell in love with Iveta and I take full responsibility,” Josef concludes.
The Worst Women’s Vices: Do They Also Refer to You?
If you ask men to be able to quote some typical vices of women, in general each of them will name them without thinking.
Dear women, do you recognize yourself in the following lines, where certain female vices are cited that succeed in boiling the blood of men?
Go to Shopping
Do you blame your average orange for having a dependence on shopping?
Do you have to buy at least one trapito a week?
Do you like to shop at discounts often?
Then, in your case, you can say that going shopping has become an addiction.
Some women realize that they should soothe their passion for shopping, at least a little.
But what woman could resist the temptation to walk around the clothing stores, look for well-fitted clothes and then try them all at the tester (ideally in all different colors)?
While for most women shopping is a hobby, for men it can become practically a hell.
Just remember how many times you’ve already told your partner that it’s best to wait for her in front of the door.
Constant dissatisfaction
“Am I not too fat?”
“I need to lose at least five pounds – should I start exercising?”
“Do you really like it?”
Do not these phrases sound?
To what yes?
Then she is one of those women obsessed with her appearance.
It’s not that you should stop taking care of yourself, but many men are allergic to listening to their partner complaining all the time about their physical appearance.
The stronger sex also agrees that the more the frequency of complaints increases, the more annoying women become.
Order and cleaning first.
It’s like an infinite thriving.
Clean the windows, pass the vacuum cleaner, rub the floor, remove dust, rub the bathtub and all that at least twice a week.
Do you reproach your partner for stepping on the clean floor with a dirty foot, your children for dirty a newly cleaned bathroom and a rack with glass doors that it cost you so much to clean?
In case you suffer from this "deviation", try to be aware that nothing should be exaggerated and that order and cleaning should not occupy being primary in the family.
This harmless desire for cleaning could threaten your relationships and family well-being.
Make unpleasant comments
“Used socks are left with dirty clothes.”
"You want to wear those worn socks tomorrow too."
“The wet cloth is not left on the floor!”
If you make those cometaries to your partner more times a day, know that this will get you out of your boxes.
You don’t mean anything bad, you just want to get everything in order.
Maybe, if men knew this, women, for their part,’t make so many comments.
Calumnias and jokes
Some women also suffer from slanders, whispers, but also offenses and conspiracies against someone.
Women focus on relationships, so they like to talk together about things like who, where, with whom, how and why.
Maybe each of us sometimes escapes a small and harmless joke.
With the hand on the heart, this is true of almost every woman.
On the other hand, there are joking women of those who don’t control themselves, who love to jok and often do so, they despise everyone and are dangerous to those around them, especially in a female work team.
Jágr and Voráček helped with their assists to defeat Philadelphia
Hockey forward Jaromír Jágr participated on Monday in the NHL match with two assists that brought the victory over Philadelphia 5:3 on the Carolina pitch and again puts Czech players at the forefront of the competition.
In both cases, Claude Giroux took advantage of the 39-year-old star's play, and took a step further and was declared the match's best player.
Two assists were awarded in the match and also Jágr's companion, Jakub Voráček.
After the meeting, Jágr said to overseas journalists that Giroux had predicted a great night.
“Before the game, I told him I would do a triple.”
“I presented him.”
"Sometimes they seem embossed," Jágr explained, after his performance gave Giroux a goal, following the Flyers' first crash.
A while later also the second intervention of the team had a Czech trace.
Voráček made the record behind the Hurricane goal and moved it between the circles to Maxim Talbot, who scored a goal.
A second before the first break a local player, Patrick Dwyer, was expelled, but from the beginning of the second half the Flyers already dominated.
Especially for Giroux.
After collaborating with Jágr he scored the third goal, after his shot collapsed by the fourth of Wayne Simmonds’s goal.
“I love playing with him.”
"I don't want to say that he is the best player on the pitch, but he is definitely among the best three," Jágr said.
"I would never have thought that at the end of my career I would play with a sportsman like him."
“I am very pleased with that.”
“I want to play for him.”
All these years in the NHL, my colleagues played for me, and that now produces results,” says Jágr.
Carolina even turned the match into a drama, with Tuom Ruutu's goal and then again Dwyer's, from penalties, to a distance goal.
Matt Read did not allow more complications, although they ended up being overtaken in number of two against one.
"Pronger had a good performance in our field."
“He dropped the record, I took speed and Read went to the most distant part.”
"I tried to hit him on the record and I'm happy because I got it," Voráček described the last goal of the match as he lived it.
With his victory, Philadelphia has taken the lead in the Eastern Conference.
Montreal's Czech defender, Jaroslav Špaček, did not play until the end of the match against Buffalo, in the second-third he retired for an injury to the upper body.
The Canadiens not only lost a player with a lot of experience in defense, but also for a difference of two goals, 2:3.
Tomáš Plekanec could not take advantage of one of the shots.
More than the points lost the local coach mourned the large number of injured in the last row, and played the game with only five defenses.
“That is bad.”
"We played the game only with one veteran player, the rest were novels."
“Well, but it’s that you can’t do anything about it, we have to deal with it,” said Jacques Martin.
"So much turning the players turned against us, we couldn't resist it."
"We had to simplify the game even more, get the record out of our field."
"And so we left gaps," explained one of the defenders, P. K. Subban.
Porter Ondřej Pavelec contributed 30 Winnipeg interventions in the 5:2 victory over Tampa Bay.
The Jets goals were scored by five players who thus put an end to a series of defeats that already lasted five games.
How Travel Prices Have Evolved Since 1989
Until 1989, there were only five authorized state travel agencies in Czechoslovakia: Čedok, Sporturist, CKM, Rekrea and Autoturist.
The travel agencies of that time sold in most cases travel only to the Socialist bloc, since trips to the West were very restricted.
Czech tourists therefore went on holiday to the beaches of the German Democratic Republic (DDR), the Soviet Union (Sochi in Crimea on the Black Sea), Bulgaria and Romania (both on the Black Sea) and Hungary (Balaton).
A positive exception was the period between 1962 and 1972, when you could travel to Yugoslavia, however, after the Yugoslav regime leaned westward and the travel of Czech tourists were then quite restricted.
A great paradox of socialism was the fact that citizens of the socialist bloc (i.e., also the Czechoslovaks) were not allowed to travel freely and individually even through the socialist countries.
If a citizen wanted to travel individually, for example, to Poland or the Soviet Union, he needed an invitation letter, otherwise individual travel was not possible.
Travel agencies offered in those times also trips to the West, but one had to catch up with a sleeping bag and spend the whole night, or have "good acquaintances" at the agency.
But not everything was won.
The so-called "promise of change" that was the condition for travel to the West, was not granted to the "politically unreliable people", who thus could not travel at all.
The Czechoslovak currency was not a freely convertible currency and, without a guarantee of exchange, it was not possible to obtain the resources (the Western currency) to travel to the West.
The vast majority of Czechs spent their holidays in their own country, so there were a large number of cabins and summer houses, which the Czechs acquired.
The Czech way of travel has undergone a real revolution since 1989.
While until 1989 for us it was no longer going to spend the holidays in the DDR or Bulgaria, last year the Czechs made 4.5 million holiday trips to countries around the world.
It is a great paradox, of which we are no longer aware today, that the currently favourite destination, Croatia, could not be freely traveled until 1989, because it was part of Yugoslavia at the time.
In the early 1990s, visa exemption was imposed to travel to neighbouring Western European states, which caused a huge wave of short-term visits, especially to Vienna or Germany.
The Czechoslovaks, for a long time, were not tired of trips to the West, everyone wanted to see them at least for a moment.
For example, in Paris, the Czech groups slept in the parks in camp shops, since our income at the time did not allow us to pay for a hotel or pension.
A typical feature of the Czechs of that time was to take food (conserves, bottles, etc.) with them to save money.
Another important moment was the introduction of the convertibility of the Czech crown, so our tourists could finally, after decades, freely buy Western currency.
Our standard of living increased and with it the average wages, which around 1997 caused an increase in travel demand.
With the rise of travel demand, agencies began, from 1997 on, to regularly prepare travel using charter flight connections, which caused incredibly low travel prices compared to the past, thanks to the possibility of obtaining discounts on the volume of passengers.
By the late 1990s, Czechs traveled without a visa to almost all developed countries except the US, which further simplified our travel.
Another interesting moment in the history of post-revolutionary tourism happened already in 2000, when, thanks to a huge demand, the first direct flight from the Czech Republic to an exotic country was organized, and went to Thailand.
Since that year, direct charter flights with Czech tourists to distant and hot countries have started every year.This winter it will already fly directly from Czech Republic to 12 exotic destinations.
The exotic countries are currently visited by about 100,000 Czechs a year.
Another interesting moment of this era, which symbolizes our post-revolutionary development, came in 2008.
On November 17, 2008, the US eliminated visas for Czech tourists, making our country one of the most developed countries in the world.
In 2008, the Czechs, for the first time in their history, spent more than half of their holidays abroad (50.3%) and for the first time in their history, they have spent more than 15 thousand Czech crowns per capita on travel abroad, including spending on the site of stay.
An Ordinary General Assembly was convened to elect the president, who could end up dead again.
Czech football has been without president for almost five months and it is likely that the successor of Ivan Hašek as President of the Czech Football Federation (FAČR), will not be known even after the convocation of the next Extraordinary General Assembly that will take place this Thursday in Nymburk.
In fact, no agreement has yet been reached on the rules of voting to follow.
Without them, you won’t even be able to vote to choose between the three candidates.
Interested in presiding the Czech football are Jindřich Rajchl, Miroslav Pelta and Tomáš Paclík.
Hašek resigned in June, not without first calling his colleagues in order to find a strong person who knew how to take care of football in the future.
However, after the Hašek era ended, a controversy broke out between the two association federations unable to come to an agreement to choose a common candidate.
That became evident on September 16 when the new president had to be elected.
The delegates of the General Assembly met in vain at the National House (Národní dům), located in the Prague neighborhood of Smíchov, because the talks had been blocked and not only as to the method of election.
No consensus was reached either as to who in the General Assembly had the right to vote – only the legal representatives or also the delegates with full powers.
From that moment and due to this single point, a partial agreement was reached, backed also by the recommendation of the Institute of State and Law, according to which representation by plenary powers is not possible.
However, disputes over the electoral code remain open.
More light on the situation could no longer shed even the Executive Committee, which, in its ordinary or extraordinary meetings, basically did not resolve anything.
The opinion about the possibility of voting has changed a couple of times already, but the neuralgic point remains the same.
The question is: how to proceed in the third round to avoid the dead spot?
"The dispute revolves around whether to proceed according to the statutes or find another model," says Dušan Svoboda, one of the three vice presidents of the FAČR, which, from the management of the association, represents professional football.
According to the model proposed in the statutes, in the third round will win the candidate who has the highest percentage of support in the federation to which he will present his candidacy.
The Moravia Region is ready to come to a compromise so that it can win that candidate with a higher total percentage of votes in both federations.
The Bohemian side, however, imposes the condition that the winner, according to these percentage calculations, must have a majority of at least two-thirds.
"This would take away, however, the sense of the two previous rounds and would completely deny the concept of a bicameral system," so Svoboda understands the objections of the Moravian side, according to which it would be best not to touch the order and vote according to the applicable statutes.
Surprisingly, Tomaš Paclík also agrees, although it is supposed that the electoral rules established by the statutes of all candidates are more suitable for Pelta.
“I would like it to be voted in accordance with the statutes.”
"So that no nonsense is invented about the representatives as in the last General Assembly," says the owner of Victoria Plzen, who posits for the first time as a candidate and who directs his remarks mainly against Pelta.
Pepe is still optimistic.
According to him, the new president will be decided at Nymburk and he believes that candidates in the future will cooperate constructively.
“All the passions will be calmed with today’s match of our national team at the European Championship.
"Football will be the protagonist again, and so it will cooperate more easily," says the representative of Jablonice, who of the three candidates has more experience in football management, both at the professional and regional level.
Rajchl is the most reticent.
"I hope that an agreement will be reached, but unfortunately, the situation is much more complicated."
"It's not about the conflict between Bohemians and Moravians, but there are attempts to adjust the rules to their own convenience."
"This may result in a new blockade of the General Assembly."
"H, I hope common sense will be imposed," Rajchl said.
There is not much time left for all parties to come to an agreement.
Some negotiations had to take place in Montenegro, but who can know until the match starts if the football team will be complete?
The special plane, on which they had to travel to Podgorica, among others the vice presidents Dalibor Kucera and Rajchl, did not leave this morning due to technical problems in Prague, having to look for an alternative to transport part of the executive committee to the place where the qualifying match will take place.
Per the decisive meeting, finally, could be the one that will take place at the ministerial level, which, according to them, will be held this Wednesday.
Josef Dobeš, Minister of Education, Youth and Sports, would love to incorporate the divided parties into the country’s most powerful sports organization so that an agreement can be reached.
There is a lot at stake: state subsidies, the credibility of football and also the upcoming General Assembly of the Central Committee of the Czech Sports Federation (ČSTV) that will try to give a new direction to Czech sport after the financial problems of the Sazka lottery house.
Paclík will struggle to reach the presidency, because he does not find a more suitable candidate.
If the head of the Pilsen footballers, Tomaš Paclik, before the extraordinary General Assembly knew the name of a suitable candidate that would satisfy all his ideas about the new president of the Czech Football Federation (FAČR), he’t even be presented as a candidate for such a relevant position.
“If there were a suitable person, I would be fighting for her and I’t be running for the election.”
"But so far no such person has been found," Paclík told the Czech News Agency (ČTK).
What motivates Paclík to enter the challenge with Miroslav Pelta and Henry Rajchl is exactly the possibility of blocking Pelta, the alleged winner of the elections, which opens the way to the presidency of the Czech Football Federation (FAČR).
Paclík also points out that, if he wins, he would remain in the office of president only until 2013, when the turn of the ordinary general assembly would arrive.
In that position he would like to see an expert and good manager who is not too related to football events.
“I’ve talked to a few people I could have considered.”
"For me it was madness to hear some say that at this time they don't even want to identify with Czech football."
“I would like to change that view,” he added.
What supposedly annoys Paclík most at this time is Pelta’s relationship with Pilsen Regional Football Association President Roman Berbr, a man with a controversial past, known out of the world as a powerful lobbyist with the ability to influence the voting of delegates in the general assembly.
For Paclík it is so unacceptable to see Pelta sitting in the presidential chair.
"If he wins, the status will remain and nothing in football will change."
“With the support of Berbra, an ambitious businessman, football will make even less profit,” Paclík said.
It also mentions the fact that a few years ago the name of Pelta was associated with a telephone listening during the investigation of a corruption case, from which Pelta came out impune.
"I don't know what prestige football could bring Pelta's victory."
"And with what eyes will the UEFA and FIFA look at us," Paclík said, who also takes with some caution his previous statement that he would "sell Club Pilsen if Pelta becomes president."
In the event of winning the elections on Thursday, Paclík could consider cooperation with Pelta in the future.
Of the same opinion is the other candidate, Rajchl, who has been backed by Paclík before the September General Assembly that ended in a fiasco.
“He (Pelta) would be the first to follow.”
“He is very capable.”
“I could imagine it, for example, as the head of the representation.”
“But not as a manager.”
"I don't even put my nose where I don't feel able," Paclík added, who in September raised a lot of attention for supporting the suspension of the Arbitration Commission chaired by Ludek Macel, later replaced by Dagmar Damkova.
Paclík admits that he would dare to manage the association.
He uses his management capabilities for private companies, since last summer he is also the Director of Pilsen, which with his support celebrated in May the triumph in the first division.
"I have the strength to change some things in the field of football and contribute to its safe practice."
"To reduce the influence of some pressure groups, which probably tend to influence the decisions of the disciplinary and appeal committee, producing unpleasant situations, Paclík said without hiding his antipathy towards Sparta president Daniel Křetínský.
One of the priorities would also be to consolidate the relationship between the FAČR and the Czech Olympic Committee, with the help of which it exercised pressure on political leaders to allocate more money to the sport from the lottery taxes.
“This is one of the key issues the new president should address.”
“If they raised the gambling taxes, as the political parties announce, they would support their arguments, but, frankly, they have to tell us where all this money is going to end,” she said.
Additionally, Paclík now doesn’t even consider his association with the Pilsner Club, although he himself claims that the FAČR President should be “not a party”.
Pelta is in turn associated with Jablonec and Rajchl with Dukla of Prague.
“It is not ideal.”
"But I don't see any sense in the fact of hypocritically ceding my shares of the Pilsen Club to another person and then returning there after a year and a half," Paclík said.
Pelta promised the FAČR new statutes that would end the dead spot of the elections.
Two days before the General Assembly of the Football Association one of the presidential candidates, Miroslav Pelt, promised that, in the event of being elected, it would ensure that the FAČR had new statutes that would definitely serve to solve, in the future, disputes regarding the electoral regulations.
Jablonec's representative is optimistic about Thursday's meeting in Nymburk, and believes the pre-election conflict could advance towards a solution today with the possible victory of the football team.
Already before the elections not held in September, Pelta promised to focus, in case of being elected, precisely on representation and raise funds.
He decided to participate in the last minute at the last general assembly, so this two-month delay could go well for him to defend and present, in a broader context, his ideas on football management.
“People at all levels have been engaged in football for a long time and are looking forward to meeting the new President this Thursday.”
"They feel that the time has come for someone to manage the association," says the man who is mainly associated with the Jablonice Club, but who worked in the Sparta and the executive committee of the Association.
For this reason, he believes he has enough experience to manage Czech football.
He is convinced that behind the current problems with the elections is the euphoria that reigned at the time of Ivan Hašek.
“Unfortunately, at the June General Assembly the statutes were passed that were not as perfect as everyone thought.”
"If we exclude certain interpretations, we have a president already since September," Pelta warned.
Exactly the readaptation of the most important document of the Civil Association was used as a sign to win delegates.
"If I am elected president, I will take it as a personal challenge and I am ready to respond in case this fails."
“It’s a matter of principles, without which we can’t exist,” says Pelta.
In addition, in theory, try not to get involved with your opponents.
Already in the past he had warned that he was collaborating with Henry Rajchl, whom he respects for his training in Law, being aware that his opponent would also be his first vice president.
It had been a long time without attacking Thomas Paclík who, unlike Pelta, did not leave a puppet with a head.
"He has been in the world of football for more than a year, and has already achieved some successes."
“Their attacks were shameful and many people were surprised by the election campaign.”
"That's why many of them doubt their true character," he told his opponent Pelta, who remains faithful to the statements announced in September.
His most powerful weapon is, according to him, his knowledge of football, from the lowest to the higher competitions.
This should be a way to promote football.
“I would also try to solve all the scandals that arose because of the Bohemians as a result of last year’s corruption scandal.”
"I would immediately then engage in negotiations with the public and private sector, to ensure that there is enough money for the whole football," the 46-year-old candidate told ČTK two months ago.
He then also promised that his appointment as president of football would not involve any personal change to the staff.
“I should first know the tasks of each employee,” he said, referring to Strahov where, after a long period of anarchy, understandable nervousness prevails.
Despite the current catastrophic scenarios for the upcoming general assembly, he believes delegates will not go in vain to Nymburk on Thursday.
“If the only point of disagreement is how to vote in the third round, we will surely get over it.
"Football needs credibility, which will only recover if it finally has a leader," still two days before the most decisive day in his career as a representative, Pelta remains optimistic.
Rajchl promises, that under his leadership, the FAČR would begin to work with desire.
If in the fourth General Assembly the current vice president Jindrich Rajchl is elected as the new president of the Czech Football Association, many people would be resented.
Rajchl promises that, if elected, he would work hard.
He wants to implement a systematic change and make members of the executive committee responsible for each area of football individually.
He also pledged to resolve the case of the Bohemians, improve relations with UEFA and FIFA, get more money for football and continue the work started by former president Ivan Hašek.
"As president, I would like to devote myself entirely to football."
"From international contacts with UEFA and FIFA to the national team, through professional football or the training of young high-performance footballers."
"With this I don't mean I would do it all alone," Rajchl said in an interview with ČTK.
“I’m a team player and I want to divide the executive committee’s powers in such a way that each member can devote themselves to a specific area.”
"And I will assign difficult tasks so that football can, in each of those segments, move forward with a lot of momentum."
“A lot of people probably won’t like this, because it will mean starting to work very hard and not just criticizing the work of others,” he added.
Due to the atmosphere of criticism in the football movement, he is said to have considered the possibility of not presenting himself again as a candidate.
“Everyone knows, I work 20 hours a day.”
"But I need to know that this will make sense and that there will be no people behind me who will stop me and hinder me at every step," he said.
“A lot of people have told me that I should not be defeated, because then others would be defeated as well.”
“It’s about having faith to not give up like this, no more,” he said.
According to them, it also motivates him to continue the work that has already begun with Hašek.
"During those two years, a lot of the work that I don't want to be lost now has been done."
"There are processes that had begun and that will have their effect within a couple of years and I would not like anyone to stop them," he announced concerned that, if they elected the other candidate, Miroslav Pelta, the situation in the association could be back as it was before the time of Hašek.
“I believe in order, and it’s something that, in my opinion, Mirek Pelta is unable to maintain.
"Behind him is above all that people who would take care of football so that it was just a privilege for a few chosen."
“You can blame me for a lot of things, but not the fact that I’m in favor of someone.”
“I try to be objective.”
“I want to do football for everyone, because only so will everyone feel good and not just the elected,” Rajchl said.
He also rejects the idea that only the president would be Bohemian.
“Al some people try to say otherwise, I’m going to do my best for Moravia.”
"For example, it's time to think about the fact of dividing the second division into a Czech part and another Morava part, whose winners would go to the first division."
“It’t be the current situation where we only have three Moravian teams, which poses a problem for young Moravian players,” Rajchl said.
Although Tomaš Paclík, president of the Pilsner Club, joined the election fight, Rajchl still believes in his chances of being elected.
"I still feel like I have strong support from the Czech Federation, which elected me as its vice president and who knows that behind me there are clear successes," said Rajchl, whose successes include saving tens of millions of crowns from disadvantaged contracts, negotiations on television contracts and negotiations on the lottery law.
On the other hand, he acknowledges his part of guilt in the fact that the federation is not united.
And while proclaiming that Pelta is “disqualified to regain confidence in Czech football,” he considers the other rival, Paclík, as a strong candidate who has something to offer football.
"No one can deny that he did a great job for Pilsen that year."
"In the event that he is elected, he will probably follow what Ivan Hašek has already begun and would not significantly change the staff in the committees."
“I don’t want to use that in my favor,” Rajchl said.
The most beautiful swimming pools in Europe
jumping to the blue
by Julia Stanek
Swimming pools from an incredible view, sumptuous baths in Budapest: Anyone visiting Europe can experience its blue wonder, and, after a visit to the city or a walk, rest their tired legs in bubbling baths.
A book shows where the best well-being is in the water.
When Iris Meder made a research trip over the past year and a half, there was something she could not miss in her luggage, a bathtub.
Tumbing his back on the water, he looked at the artistic dome on top, swam toward the marble angelotes, who waited for her on the edge of the pool, and amazed at the meticulously restored modernist covered pool.
He liked the bathroom, took note in his booklet at the time of all the interesting details about the style and history of the building.
Architectural historian Meder has explored more than 200 pools in this way and presents them in her recent book “Badefreuden”: the covered pools in Munich, the historic bathing palaces in the Black Forest, the “beton constructions” in Taunus.
He made his "travel through the most extraordinary baths of Central Europe" through 13 countries: In addition to Germany, Austria and Switzerland, he visited places in Italy, France, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Hungary, Romania, Poland, and a city in Luxembourg, Serbia and Croatia respectively.
This 46-year-old German is a true enthusiast of bathing culture.
He doesn’t want to have anything to do with sport, says Meder, only water is different.
It’s just annoying that bathing enthusiasts have to conform to blue tiles and chlorine fever, while running enthusiasts can breathe the fascinating smell of the avocado forests or listen to the joyful trine of birds in the park.
“One day I wondered why swimming pools must always be so ugly,” says this Viennese resident.
“I started collecting beautiful swimming pools.”
The surface of the water doubles the architecture.
The swimming in the pool and the etheric oils of the sauna.The well-being factor in the pools is so great because all senses are served, according to Meder.
And if the builder struggles, covered pools can be a real gift for the sight: "Instead of floor, in the bathrooms you have a water surface."
"On the one hand it is transparent, on the other hand it reflects the beauty of the entire building."
Everything folds optically: the high boards, colored tiles, trampolines.
The book with small-format photographs "Badefreuden" provides in 190 pages very interesting data on architecture and the history of art in the historical oasis of well-being, but, mainly, gives you the desire to jump to the blue.
Meder, a swimming pool collector, discovers the outstanding specimens of her research in Hungary.
Alongside the magnificent medicinal baths such as the 100-year-old Széchenyi Bath in Budapest, there are nitrate waters in a singular kárstic cavity (cavity baths in Miskolc-Tapolca), as well as a spa, whose swimming pools are of alkaline water and are in a bottle-shaped building (Városi Termálfürdö in Jászberény).
Many swimming pools discovered in Switzerland and Austria offer spectacular views: While the whole city puts your eyes on Zurich’s rooftop pool, you can look at Arlberb, covered with snow, from the outdoor pool of a bath in St. Anton, and: In the Turkish bath there is a window from which you can observe the practice on the ski slopes.
Per the most extraordinary design awaits customers at Längenfeld: Ötztal’s Water Cathedral looks like an UFO that just landed in the Alps.
From three open springs steam rises in winter, while the Ötztal mountains rise in the sky.
Alhambra in the Black Forest
Meder, the swimming pool collector, did not smell the smell of chlorine in all swimming pools.
Many thermal baths smell sulfur, in the Árpád baths in Békescsaba, Hungary, the gasoline plague is so strong that people believe they have reached a sanitary bath.
The smell comes from the medicinal waters that contain bicarbonate and alkali and whose legume sticks to the skin when entering the pool, enjoying well-being in a special way.
Iris Meder was also disappointed in one place in her search for beautiful places for bathing, when she wanted to visit open swimming pools and sunbaths in the Czech bath of Luhatschowitz, she encountered a blocked ground.
The 1902 bathroom of architect Duan Jurkovic was closed.
When Meder looked through the crumbling windows of the red, white and yellow modernist building, he saw the dirt grow between the tiles.
Decadence countered in a charming swimming pool in the Black Forest: the Thermal Palace in Bad Wildbald.
These bathrooms have three phases of construction behind them; not only can neoromanic elements from the time of their construction in 1844 be discovered, but also an Arabic hall in the Alhambra style, added in 1900.
Since its thorough modernization in 1995, the Thermal Palace has been the favorite bathroom of swimming pool collector Iris Meder, and not only because it is natural of the Black Forest.
“It has a lot of merit to merge different architectural styles into such a fantastic unity,” says Meder.
In such a palace the immersion in the thermal pool apparently does not have much importance.
Agricultural speculation
Deutsche Bank reviews the commodity business
by Christian Teevs
Will Deutsche Bank give up its agricultural commodity business?
According to SPIEGEL-ONLINE information, Josef Ackermann has commissioned a working group to check the consequences of speculation for the poor of the world.
In January, the head of the consortium wants to show the consequences.
and Hamburg,
For citizens, the matter is clear, according to a study, 84 percent of Germans do not find it acceptable for banks to speculate with agricultural raw materials such as wheat or corn.
Two-thirds of respondents demand that Deutsche Bank and other credit institutions withdraw from this business because it intensifies the problems of the world’s poorest.
This is the result of a survey commissioned by the consumer organization Foodwatch.
The study is based on a report presented to Foodwatch in mid-October.
Author Harald Schumann shows that betting on global commodity markets makes prices rise, and banks bear responsibility for the global hunger problem.
The consumer advocate campaign is specifically directed at Josef Ackermann, the head of Deutsche Bank, although big banks like Goldman Sachs or Morgan Stanley act in a similar way.
Originally, commodity betting was thought to protect traders from price fluctuations.
Leading experts agree that players have disconnected themselves from supply and demand, and make gains from the costs of the poorest.
Ackermann reacted to criticism differently than U.S. competitors: he promised to review claims and said no business “deserves to compromise Deutsche Bank’s good reputation.”
According to SPIEGEL ONLINE, an international working group is reviewing the claims of the Foodwatch report.
The analysis is expected to be completed by the end of the year, then the results will be presented to the Deutsche Bank board, along with a recommendation on how to handle the matter.
At the end of January, the management of the bank will report on the consequences.
In the end, there could be a reduction in the business of raw materials, or even its total abandonment.
Ackermann tries to fix his image.
Thilo Bode, founder of Foodwatch, celebrated the news, but reaffirmed his criticism of the financial sector: “Bets on rising food prices show in drastic ways how ruthless banks are currently harming public welfare.”
Ackermann finds himself as the largest banker, especially in bonds.
“Deutsche Bank should cancel all investments in its portfolio in which it puts the money at stake for food price bets,” Bode said.
"It doesn't matter if Ackermann is dealing with the issue of hungry people or the fame of Deutsche Bank."
Ackermann’s inspection looks surprising at first glance, but it’s clear that the head of the consortium wants to offer a perfect image a few months before leaving his post.
On Monday, Deutsche Bank announced that the chairman of the board will change something different from what was not planned in the board of directors.
With the abandonment of controversial agricultural speculation it can perfect its image.
And you need to hardly care about possible losses, that is what your successor will take care of.
Two-thirds would cancel investment in raw materials
Foodwatch strives to keep the pressure on the manager high.
So far, more than 30,000 internautes have participated in the organization’s campaign.
On Tuesday, Bode published the survey for which the Forsa Institute had asked 1.001 people on November 7 and 8.
Only 10 percent considered it legitimate for Deutsche Bank to offer investments in which food prices were placed.
Many customers of the bank showed personal consequences when discovering that their bank was involved in such: according to the survey, two-thirds would cancel all investments from which money comes from agricultural speculation.
43% would discourage such a bank to their acquaintances, 49% would request, after reflection, to cancel their account and switch to another institute.
House 21 in Vienna
The flags moved
by Ingeborg Wiensowski
A history of architecture with ups and downs and a happy ending, the pavilion of the 1958 Austrian Universal Exhibition in Brussels won awards, was in Vienna for a museum, left empty and collapsed.
It is now reopened as an exhibition house.
Modern postgerra architecture passions, clear shapes, glass halls, bold curves and new building materials, typical of the thinking about technical progress, for which, the Austrian pavilion of architect Karl Schwanzer for the 1958 Brussels Universal Exhibition is an appropriate and well-known example.
The Schwanzer Pavilion then won the Grand Prix of Architecture for its lightweight and floating construction of steel and glass.
The building is considered to be a contemporary milestone of architecture.
He made the architect so famous that he also built the Pavilion of Austria at the next universal exhibition.
With its legendary four-cylinder tower for MBW plus the adjacent flat building in Munich, it became internationally known.
His pavilion, designed as a temporary construction for exhibitions was erected after the universal exhibition at the Schweizer Garten next to the southern Vienna station, was reformed in 1962 and inside a 20th-century museum was inaugurated, it was called the "House 20".
The building was suitable but lacked the spaces and technology suitable for a museum; without any wall to hang art, nor a good atmosphere.
Despite this it was used until contemporary art in Vienna had a new home.
The building has been empty since 2001 and decays more and more.
Currently, architect Adolf Krischanitz reformed the pavilion, now calling it "House 21" and will be used in the future as a museum of contemporary art.
On Tuesday afternoon the belvedere museum, to which the house belongs, was inaugurated, with the first exhibition, a blow of luck in a way.
Agnes Husslein-Arco, the new director of the Austrian belvedere gallery since 2007, has made a new beginning.
Husslein-Arco, a doctorate in art history with a considerable career, among other things, art skater on ice in her youth, later at Sotheby's, the Guggenheim Museum and founding director of the Salzburg Museum of Modern Art, carried out the reforms with the insistence of politicians and protectors of monuments, provided public funds and private sponsors and established their use.
With the exception of contemporary art, the works of the sculptor Fritz Wotruba of the homonymous foundation are exhibited, there should be a cafeteria and a bookstore and an office building should also be built.
Strict control and low budget
Krischanitz was the best choice to do so.
Not only because he sensibly reformed the secession of Joseph Olbrichs in Vienna, he expanded it and he was awarded the contest, but also because he studied with Schwanzwer at the Technical University of Vienna and the pavilion was for him a "important and immense place", in which he contemplated "almost every weekend" exhibitions.
He knew the project and the problem of the building, which disappeared with its transfer to Vienna in its change of use with generosity and ease.
In current reforms there are big problems, the building was “an energy-devorer,” Krischanitz said.
The profile of the glass facade windows was changed, an insulating glass reinforced with fiberglass was installed and the glass ceiling was replaced with a special safety glass.
Thermal bridges and steel beams were reinforced or replaced and asbestos ceilings were rehabilitated.
Two basements were used for the new use, a light panel descended between the house and the street provides lighting, a bridge serves to enter the almost new building, but still the Schwanzer pavilion.
The original exterior doors remain, the house is painted in ancient caoba tones and protected from oxidation.
And the cinema room is exactly as it was before.
And all this with strict control by the monument office and a low budget.
“I often had to find material that was good, inexpensive and would also like the monument protection office,” Krischanitz says and warns of a rough floor in the basement.
Despite all the pressures, problems and reforms, the building remains flexible and lightweight.
The flag "which came from Brussels" has been difficult, Krischanitz recently said, a typical "casual appearance in the city's history".
Such an architecture is “always in the wrong place” and that’s why it wanted to “awaken the right consciousness.”
In this case the house 21 is not in the wrong place, a urban luck has happened.The entirely new and planned "central station neighborhood", with housing and offices, is located next to the Schweizer Garten.
And another blow of luck happens: House 21 could receive a reinforcement from another Krischanitz construction, since the collector Francesca von Habsburg has bought the Berlin temporary art hall and, as it is heard, negotiates with the city on a neighboring place in the Schweizer Garten.
Deutsche Bahn Plans Winter Crisis Package
The company has come up with a crisis plan, which would prevent train failures in the winter.
The number of staff should be doubled.
It costs millions.
In the fight against train failures and delays caused by the winter, Deutsche Bahn has spent more than 70 million euros this year, according to a journalistic report.
The newspaper "Bild", invoking an internal crisis plan of the group, the planned investments until 2005 of a total of around 300 million euros.
For this, a better availability of vehicles and the rail network should be achieved even with extreme time.
Among other things, it is planned to double the internal and external employees to 16,000 jobs to remove the snow from the roads and slopes.
The goal is to clean the snow and ice slopes for operation and 90 percent of the needles needed for operation within four to five hours.
Two months ago, Rüdiger Grube, president of Deutsche Bahn, warned of failures and delays in trains also during this winter following a summit with the government and industry.
Last winter Deutsche Bahn suffered considerable problems in the transport of passengers, as, among other things, it lacked reservations in the face of adverse weather conditions.
Many new regional trains have been waiting for years for an authorization from the federal railway office.
There is also a delay in the delivery of high-speed trains.
Deutsche Bahn has been working for years to check the axes of high-speed trains frequently at the workshop, after a high-speed train suffered the break of an axis at the Cologne central station.
Deutsche Bank is paying millions in fines in the United States.
After the riot over President Josef Ackerman, a new U.S. problem appears, the Deutsche Bank must pay a million-dollar fine there.
As if the problems were not enough for the Deutsche Bank, its past in the U.S. acquires the giant of the sector, the Frankfurt Institute pays $145 million (106 million euros) in an agreement, to end the quarrels due to the bankruptcy of five major credit cooperatives during the financial crisis.
This is the sale of mortgages.
Financial market regulator NCUA accuses many large banks of inducing credit cooperatives with false promises to buy financial products; they have minimized the risks.
Such bonds lost their value during the financial crisis and drag banks to the depths.
“We are pleased to be able to clarify the matter without the parties having to go to the courts,” a Deutsche Bank spokesman in New York said.
The bank is not guilty of the deal.
This also applies to Citigroup, which forced a payment of $20.5 million.
Debbie Matz, chairman of NCUA, celebrated the deference of both financial institutions.
The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) is responsible for U.S. credit cooperatives and provides bankruptcy support to protect customer investments.
The NCUA tries to reintegrate the million-dollar losses originated.
The agreements currently closed are their first type.
The regulator had also ordered accounts from other major banks and in the summer filed lawsuits against JPMorgan Chase, the Royal Bank of Scotland and Goldman Sachs.
In the case of dubious mortgage securities, they are called mortgage-backed securities.
These are based on housing loans.
When the U.S. real estate bubble broke out in 2007, it led to the destruction of many financial institutions.
In September 2008, at the height of the financial crisis, the US investment bank Lehman Brothers collapsed.
Although the results happened a few years ago, it is currently blowing a complicated wind for U.S. banks.
Investors and the inspection have enacted countless lawsuits to receive compensation or sanction faults.
The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) has produced the most claims.
The 18 major international banks are accused that the two U.S. state mortgage agencies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have taken advantage of the mortgage business in a volume of approximately $200 billion.
Also the Deutsche Bank has a claim from the FHFA, it is business worth $14.2 billion from the year 2005 to 2007.
The inspection demands that the Frankfurt Institute be held accountable for "substantial losses", without naming an exact figure.
The Deutsche Bank rejected the debt as unfounded and explained that it wants to defend itself.
Warren Buffett contributes $10 billion to IBM
The finance guru, Buffett, is investing heavily in the Information Technology company IBM.
Since March, it has acquired shares worth more than $10 billion.
So far, the great American investor Warren Buffett has always stated not to invest in computer companies or Information Technologies as the forecasts for the long-term development of the companies are negative.
But he has read IBM’s business report and changed his mind on investing in the sector.
He had to understand long before that IBM primarily offers services and purchases computer systems for the Information Technology departments of other companies.
In the financial world, an investment by Warren Buffett is considered an honor.
Therefore, the primitive of Information Technologies should be called "Sir IBM."
Buffett has revealed on CNBC that he has acquired shares of IBM for $10.7 billion since March.
Its Berkshire Hathaway investment has thus risen to one of IBM’s largest shareholders with a stake of 5.5 percent.
Buffett said IBM did not know anything about the deal so far.
He praised the management who took care of the ordinary profits in the economic crisis.
“They did a great job,” Buffett said of the strategy.
IBM has for some time established lucrative Information Technology services such as the operation of computer centers.
The 100-year-old computer pioneer also offers software and advice as well as powerful equipment for.
Buffett has avoided technology companies so far.
He said he only invested in companies whose he understood.
On the contrary, Buffett took advantage of the occasion in a freight train, in a lubricant manufacturer, or in a mechanical engineer.
Its Berkshire Hathaway owns approximately 80 own subsidiaries, as well as part of a whole series of large consortia such as Coca-Cola or Munich Re, formerly Municher Rück.
Buffett, 81, took over the small textile company Berkshire Hathaway in the 1960s and, with wise investments, expanded it to become one of the most valuable companies in the world.
His lifestyle is humble.
That’s why it’s an idol for countless investors around the world.
His quick and infallible sense of making money has given him the nickname of "Oracle of Omaha".
After discovering Buffett’s investment, IBM’s stock on the stock market rose by one percent.
The "blue giant", as IBM is known, has a stock market value of more than $220 billion and is, along with Apple and Microsoft, among the most valuable technology companies in the world.
With Microsoft, Buffett said, he does not want to collaborate.
Bill Gates, its founder, is a close friend.
The threat is concrete
Following the discovery of the “Zwickau cell”, Turkish media doubts the German rule of law.
A newspaper speaks of a “bloody ideology” that is reviving.
The murders of eight tricks and Greek small businessmen between 2001 and 2006 have a backdrop of the far right.
Turkey and the German population of Turkish origin have reacted with fear and concern to this news.
For many Germans of Turkish origin comes back a ghost that was thought dead long ago, since the bombings in the form of fires in Mölln in November 1992 and in Solingen in May 1993, there had been no more episodes of extreme right-wing violence against Turks.
Nevertheless, it has never been questioned that there is xenophobia in Germany.
The ultra-right network discovered reveals a magnitude whose dimensions were not, much less, predictable.
"Is the bloody ideology reviving again?", titles the online edition of the Turkish newspaper Haberturk.
The newspaper "Sabah" on the contrary points out that one of the perpetrators was an informant from the Federal Office for the Defense of the Constitution and is concerned that German authorities may be involved in the far-right panther.
The Turkish community in Germany reacted wisely, on the weekend remembering the victims of racist violence with a vigil in front of the Brandenburg Gate.
Two weeks earlier, the Turkish community in Berlin together with German and Turkish politicians reflected on a solemn event commemorating the 50th anniversary of the Turkish-German agreement.
The cohabitation was put on stage with cheerful colors, like a story with a happy ending.
The information came to some Turkish media as a whistleblower: "The German gift for the 50th anniversary," says the title of an article on the Turkish internet platform "Haber X", referring to the backdrop of the chain of murders.
The German show "Hürriyet" does not insist on tracing this mental connection either.
"It begins to smell bad," says the title of Ahmet Külahci's column.
It highlights that the killed were people who paid their taxes and made an important contribution with their work to the reconstruction of Germany.
On the internet forums of Germans of Turkish origin, the behavior of the police and their subsequent success in searches are discussed very critically.
The authors are surprised that the German authorities have not long sought suspects in the circle of the far-right.
Some show themselves as less rhetorical as to the drastic media: "From now on here you are lost, the immigrants are left with only self-defense and weapons."
“This is the best self-protection.”
"Germany's internal peace depends heavily on the quality of the clarification and the adequacy of the sanction to the entire network," writes "Selen".
This means that if Germany’s internal peace is in jeopardy, the Mölln and Solingen attacks will be clarified in ninety years.
The image of the ruins of the Solingen fire has been recorded in German and Turkish memoirs.
No other event has shown more clearly to the Turks living here that there is a concrete threat and, to the Germans, that distrust and distance can result in violence.
The attacks sharpen the group sentiment on the Turkish side.
Do not repeat the mistakes of the past
In the Turkish press was then criticized mainly the deficiency of German policy after the attacks, Helmut Kohl refuses to visit the survivors of Mölln.
After the fire-shaped bombing of Solingen, he sent a telegram of condolences to the Turkish president and Klaus Kinkel, his foreign minister, replaced him at the funeral in Cologne.
It is clear how the value of a person is calculated according to the amount of his taxes.
Current information from Turkish media shows again how profound, since then, is the distrust of many Germans of Turkish origin in the legality of this country.
In addition to the effort for a broad explanation and a re-evaluation of extreme right-wing terrorism in Germany, this time, frank words are needed.
The Scandal of Lake Zurich
The most risky bank in Europe is not in Italy or France, but in Switzerland.
UBS almost went bankrupt in the financial crisis and has since slipped from one crisis to the next.
It is run by a German.
Axel Weber did not think so.
After his spectacular departure from the federal bank summit, in July it became known that in 2013 he would begin a new and almost equally spectacular job: Chairman of the board of the large Swiss bank UBS, an unexpected and lucrative step in his career.
Axel Weber publicly rejoices, praises Switzerland for its beauty and UBS for its newly acquired solidity and leaves out kind observations about its future counterparts.
“USB has achieved a revitalization.”
“I am delighted to collaborate with Kaspar Villiger and Oswald Grübel.”
In September, it became clear that everything would be completely different.
A financial USB operator in London escaped all of the bank’s security systems and scammed 1.7 billion euros.
Oswald Grübel, CEO of USB, a banker not only known in Switzerland, had to come.
The chairman of the USB board has since considered himself equally touched, and everyone has asked: When does Axel Weber arrive?
It was known that Weber would have to advise the bank since February 2012.
And he will take over the chairmanship of the board of directors in May, not early 2013, as the bank announced on Tuesday.
This is hard for Axel Weber.
He is not a banker, rather, a professor of economics and a counselor and has had a period of adaptation necessary.
He becomes responsible for the strategy of a bank, which has just proven again that it deserves the title “the biggest scandal bank in Europe” for a long time.
On the one hand, the USB is huge, until recently it was the world’s largest asset manager, and on the other hand, for years, it slips from one scandal to the next.
Nothing, it seems, is saved to the formerly so proud Swiss bank.
The financial crisis began.
The USB had an excellent reputation until 2007.
The image of the Swiss asset manager discreet and solid, but also timid, combined with ambitious goals, also wanted to be a great number in investment banks.
On the one hand, with $1.6 trillion, USB manages more money from wealthy customers than any other bank in the world.
And on the other hand, it advanced as an investment bank in the league of the world’s major banks.
This impresses me.
Hans Geiger, former banker and subsequent banking professor in Zurich for many years explains: “Before my students, I have always qualified USB as a model of a good bank.”
“From the current point of view, one asks: How could I be wrong?”
I was in a big mistake.
In the year 2007 it came to light that something went very wrong with the USB.
In the middle of the year, Peter Wuffli, CEO, who until then was considered a brilliant and very intelligent banker, surprisingly resigned.
A few months later, the reason was suspected.
The bank’s investment fund embarked on losses with high-risk bonds and had to amortise billions.
To charge this, the USB announced a capital injection of no less than 13 billion francs.
For this he found investors, of course, that some had looked at with contempt until recently: an Asian and opaque state fund of Singapore and an Arab state fund, so discreet, that his name had never been heard.
This was just the first blow.
In 2008, it got worse.
The bank had to declare the loss of billions, Marcel Ospel, chairman of the board of directors, in 2006 in the second highest paid board of directors of Switzerland, resigned.
In October 2008, the catastrophe continued, in view of its mistaken investments, UBS was in financial crisis in the face of bankruptcy and had to be rescued by the state.
The national bank bought problematic securities from UBS for many billions, the Swiss Confederation gave six billion francs for an obligatory convertible bond, through which it became a co-owner of the bank.
The entire Switzerland was affected, it was claimed how dramatic this was for a small country, if it hosts such large banks.
Finally the sum of the UBS balance sheet in 2007 was more than five times greater than Switzerland’s economic results (see graph).
“We can’t rescue UBS again,” said Geiger, a banking expert.
To the first disaster joined the second.
A few months later, UBS capitulated in a tax dispute with America and was willing to hand over the data of the wealthy customers, who had possibly evaded taxes with the help of the bank.
In addition, it approves a sum of $780 billion, reimbursement of unjustified profits from these with a payment compensation.
With this, the UBS confessed more or less to having helped in the tax evasion.
Simultaneously, he lost something that had always been his capital in the competition for wealthy customers: the aureola of discretion.
After the scandal, the Swiss bank secret is no longer the same.
This was followed by the resignation of the chairman of the board and the chairman of the board of directors.
and the outflow of customer funds.
In this way, in a few months, the bank lost its credibility in its two central sectors: in investment banking through erroneous speculation and in asset management through aid to tax fraud.
And just when it was again somewhat quieter, just when it was thought that UBS would get it again, this unfortunate story of the operator happens, an individual operator defrauded 1.7 billion euros, before the bank realized that something was going wrong.
And it turned out, apparently, this still doesn’t work well with risk management in investment banking.
“The Adoboli case shows that risk controls have changed too little,” said Martin Janssen, a professor of economics and finance at the University of Zurich’s Banking Institute.
The chief financial officer of a major German bank is also confident: “The problem with UBS is that it doesn’t dominate risk controls.”
So came the idea of the precaution, with which Swiss bankers have long been presented, to be the guardians of the world’s greatest assets: no too big risk, on the other hand, the security of money wants to break on the other side of the Alpine republic.
The security deposits of Swiss banks were the symbol of unbreakable reliability, like Lindt and Sprüngli of authentic chocolate.
The UBS headquarters in Zurich doesn’t fit the cliché of the solid Swiss private bank, it’s just a little bigger.
The situation is classic.
The bank has its headquarters on Zurich’s Bahnhofstraße, which runs from the main station directly to Lake Zurich, framed by the snow-covered peaks of the Swiss mountains.
Here the buildings are ostentative, rents are among the highest in Europe.
Here you can find jewellery such as Tiffany’s among traditional Swiss such as the Sprüngli confectionery.
Swiss banks have been residing here for years: from the national bank, through the Palace of Credit Suisse, to the elite private banks such as Julius Bär.
You enter the UBS reception room through a heavy turning door.
Inside the walls are covered in marble, in front are large leather chairs, next to the bank logo there is a large sign to indicate "security".
UBS knows what the customer is looking for here: Security.
The two major Swiss banks, UBS and Credit Suisse, at some point have displaced the idea of the big Swiss bank, or betrayed it, as the president of a small private Swiss bank thinks.
He prefers not to read his name in the newspaper, after all he does, like all Swiss bankers, also with the business of both major banks.
UBS has become too big, he thinks, mainly in investment banking, where Anglo-Saxons have gained ground.
The Swedes had nothing else to say.
"And they have long been accustomed to the customs of the Anglo-Saxons."
In fact, UBS changed the Anglo-Saxon investment banking, delivered its first big profit and then came the disaster, no European financial institution had lost so much money in the high-risk jungle as the big Swiss bank.
On October 15, 2008, the catastrophe was evident.
“This Wednesday, the government coalition of the small seven-million-nation decided on the largest rescue operation in the history of its nation,” writes author Lukas Hässig in his book Der UBS-Crash.
Politicians granted up to 68 billion francs or approximately 45 billion euros to save the big bank from bankruptcy.
How do they think?
Speaking with Swiss bankers, they see the problem in the UBS dimension.
In June 1998, two of the three major Swiss banks merged into a powerful consortium.
A bank arises that, due to the merger, was too big for the small Switzerland, and continues to grow.
So it served for the two distinct precursor banks of UBS to complement each other: a wealthy but dormant bank with the center of asset management in Zurich and a poorer but stronger internationalization.
Suddenly, internationalized investment banks arrived in a timely manner with a lot of money, with which they could make a big financial bike run.
There are two names related to this UBS rise: Peter Wuffli, head of the UBS consortium from 2001 to 2007, and Marcel Ospel, then chairman of the board.
“I always thought Wuffli and Ospel were a perfect team,” says banking expert Hans Geiger.
"Wuffli, the intellectual, modest, who understands much of models and statistics, and Ospel, the intuitive who managed to open up from learning at the bank to the summit."
Eventually, Ospel trusted Wuffli.
And eventually Wuffli probably made a decisive mistake: “He thought his models were a reality,” says Geiger.
“It’s a tragic case.”
Per tragic though.
It is clear: The defeat came before the case.
UBS employees clearly remember the executive meetings, where Wuffli, the head of the consortium, always repeated the same motto: Falling Goldman Sachs from the throne.
The American Bank was the most powerful investment bank in the world.
They headed the "League Tables", the classifications that then documented the success of banks.
UBS wanted to be at the summit.
Some steps went well.
In foreign exchange and stock trading it was at the highest level.
However, the business advisors in charge highlighted a weak point: In the business of international interest, in the language of banking "fixed income", there is a huge compensation for big banks.
UBS has gaps in American mortgage products.
To fill these gaps, UBS began an adventure that almost cost it its existence.
Avid for growth, they invested both the same bank and one of their high-risk funds created in high-risk American investments.
It transformed into a powerful machine to securize American mortgages and then sell them, keeping certain risks on its own.
And also, like other banks sought down for a long time.
“In the summer of 2007, as the U.S. real estate market was on fire, UBS bought there,” said Geiger, a banking expert.
So great the euphoria, so deep the fall.
One manager had to leave, as the attempt to order turned out to be more complicated than they expected.
UBS seats became projectable seats and are insecure to this day.
Nowadays, whoever runs a big bank has an almost impossible job.
You must find a strategy for a bank, before which all logical business models are lost.
Geiger, a banking expert, has an idea, put an end to investment banking, focus on asset management, return to Swiss roots.
The bank doesn’t want to go so far (yet).
But investment banking needs to decrease a lot, it’s clear now.
Next Thursday, Sergio Ermotti, the bank’s new president, will present his future strategy to the world.
In fact, only the 51-year-old Italian-Swiss was thought of as a transitional solution, as the bank the bank separated surprisingly from its predecessor Grübel.
Meanwhile, he imposed himself: He must permanently direct UBS business, the Zurich bank said on Tuesday.
Ermotti wants to return the investment bank to its state in the mid-1990s.
Remove 3,500 jobs.
But this is not enough.
UBS needs a vision.
Who is it?
What do you want to make money with?
These are the questions that Axel Weber is asking today.
So far he only says that he will first look for a house with his wife in Zurich.
The next year.
Fear of recession in Europe weighs on U.S. stock market
The imminent recession in Europe has scared U.S. investors at the beginning of the week.
The government changes in Athens and Rome remain in force.
The slowing industrial production on the continent stifles hopes of stabilizing at its origin a debt-induced crisis.
It could not impose general relief on the change of government in Rome and Athens.
The euro fell against the dollar.
Last week, the Italian and Greek glass has been seen half full, not half empty, but now the problems go back to the forefront, said Janney Montgomery Scott’s Mark Luschini.
First of all, financial assets are listed on the sales list.
The Dow Jones Standard Stock Index closed down 0.6 percent to 12,078 points.
In the session, the market barometer ranges between 12.027 and 12.170 points.
The S&P 500 index closed at 1,251 points, down one percent.
The Nasdaq index of the technology stock exchange lost 0.8 percent and went out of the market with 2.657 points.
In Frankfurt, the Dax index dropped by 1.2 percent to 5,985 points.
The industry of the 17 euro countries has clearly reduced its production and is at the end of its boom.
Companies produced two percent less in September than in the previous month, according to the statistical office of Eurostat.
What created skepticism among U.S. investors: “We are not an island, if not dependent,” said Steve Goldman of Goldman Management.
Europe cannot get out of a recession so quickly, and there are more signs of weakness in banks.
Warren Buffett, the legend of investments, only confirmed this caution, it is still unclear whether Europe is strong enough to do everything necessary to end the crisis, he said in an interview with CNBC.
Therefore, from their point of view, it is too early to invest in state loans or European banks.
Instead, it throws over a decade of old principles and enters the U.S. technology sector.
Its more than $10 billion investment in IBM supports the listing of the traditional consortium’s shares and makes it list against the market trend at first just a higher percentage.
The value closed almost unchanged at $187.35.
After some indications, Buffett paid an average of $170 for each unit and retained the 5.5 percent.
The shares of his investment firm Berkshire Hathaway lost 1.3 percent.
Bank of America’s securities clearly strengthened by 2.6 percent than the market.
The house sells almost all of its remaining shares to China Construction Bank for $6.6 billion.
The institute wants to mainly strengthen its share of capital with the net profit of the business and thus meet regulatory requirements.
Aircraft manufacturer Boeing increased its profits and thus limited losses in Dow.
The share rose 1.5 percent, after the consortium collected the largest order in its history.
Airline Emirates ordered 50 777 long-haul aircraft on Friday and the order amounted to $18 billion.
Including options for 20 more machines, the volume amounts to $26 billion.

719 values rose, 2281 decreased and 79 remained unchanged.
The Nasdaq closed with sales volumes of 1.38 billion, 630 shares up, 1.913 down and 82 unchanged.
Smart cities spread across cities
In many places, frogs are considered “problematic birds”: these intelligent animals are not driven out of the cities for a long time, experts say.
Some like them, others want to get rid of them very quickly, the fat belongs for years to the image of the city, but in many municipalities complaints of the neighbors are accumulated by the crap and the noise of the animals.
Although no means has appeared against “problematic birds” so far.
Fats no longer leave the cities, experts say at the first symposium on fats in Leer, Eastern Frisia.
There, experts from all over the country discuss possible solutions.
Looking for alternatives in cities
Ecologists attribute the problems of cities to the field migration of certain protected grains; chemical applications in agriculture visibly end with traditional living spaces.
Hunting, growing buildings and falling trees that host them make it difficult for birds to live.
The grains are protected.
There are large colonies with more than 600 breeding couples in Soest, Westphalia, among others, in the northwest, among others in Jever, Diepholz and Achim in Bremen, as well as in Leer.
There in 2005 a controversial project to mass kill the district’s grays jumped to the negative press headlines.
Critics have called the hunting of animals by means of bird traps and the killing with sticks especially brutal.
“Bringing them out and removing them normally does not get anything,” said Werner Klöver, a Leer urbanist and landscape designer.
Shooting with water to the nests or throwing the trees are often undesirable consequences, says also Manfred Kaiser, environmental expert from Lahr, Baden-Württemberg.
“Animals divide, large colonies divide and distribute elsewhere.”
Removing them can only be imagined as an exception in hospitals, old-age residences or schools.
“We have to live with them, we don’t catch them anymore.”
Without the surroundings, the problem is not solved in the cities, says Wolfgang Kellner, mayor of Leer.
It is possible to combine the eviction of animals from sensitive residential areas and cebs so that they can settle again elsewhere.
"Information panels instead of chain seals" Uta Maria Jürgens, a psychologist and ethnologist, advertises against treating animals in a completely different way: "The best thing is that we can hold a spike in the face with a slug."
Jürgens co-founded in Schleswig-Holstein the Ascheberger Grail teaching circuit, where signs report on the life of intelligent birds.
Meanwhile, the project is accepted by tourists.
Jürgens also has his own opinion on the criticism of bird noise: "All are forms of communication, they have a lot to say."
The intelligence and skill of these animals are legendary, grays not only take advantage of the resources to access scissors but also make tools to use them as resources.
Recently, ethologists at the University of Cambridge checked in four degrees how far the intelligence of birds goes.
In one experiment, birds quickly learned that they had to drop a stone on a platform to reach a puppet larva.
Without much training, they determined the size and shape of the stone to fall on the platform.
In a second essay, the astute fat had to solve a complicated problem.
The researchers placed a small cube with a puppet larva in a vertical cylinder.
The birds could not reach their prey with the pike.
But the researchers left them a piece of wire.
With which the four animals formed a hook, with which they fished the cube in the tube shooter.
Three of the four greats succeeded in the first attempt.
Portugal at Euro 2012 thanks to Cristiano Ronaldo
The Bosnians and Turks have no hope in the championship.
The favourites, Portugal, Croatia, the Czech Republic and Ireland will also be in the Euro 2012.
Portugal, the Czech Republic, Croatia and Ireland have sealed in the play-offs the last tickets for the 2012 Euro Cup in Poland and Ukraine.
Guided by the triumphant hero Cristiano Ronaldo (8., 53.), Portugal scored Bosnia-Herzegovina 6-2 (2-1) and, after the 0-0 of the tournament match, made the five Euro participations in a row.
The Czechs achieved 1-0 (0-0) in the play-off return match with the outsider Montenegro, after that in the go-off match (2-0) left things clear.
Croatia did not allow it to score 0-0 against Turkey, Ireland scored 1-1 (1-0) against Estonia.
Nani (24), Helder Postiga (72, 82) and Miguel Veloso (80) scored the other goals of Portugal.
Former Bundesliga professional Zvjezdan Misimovic with a penalty (41) and captain Emir Spahic (65) cut distances twice for Bosnia.
Sena Lulic got a red card (54).
Bosnia failed due to Portugal in the playoffs of the 2010 South Africa World Cup.
At the Estadio da Luz in Lisbon, Portugal started perfectly.
Ronaldo ran a straight free from over 30 meters to get to the head on the points.
A quarter of an hour later, Nani showed his gifts to score from afar and got the 2-0 from 25 meters.
The Bosnians, who failed in the first half hour, had their first clear chance thanks to goalkeeper Edin Dzeko.
The former Wolfsburg player, leader of English Manchester City, sent a headshot to the stick, but the ball did not cross the goal line (33).
Jiracek wins for Czech Republic
Then college student Wolfgang Stark, from Ergolding, was in the eye of the hurricane.
After the attack on Helder Postiga in the area of penati Bosnia, he decided to show the Portuguese the yellow card for throwing himself to the ground (36).
On the opposite side, Stark pitched a controversial penalty after an action by Fabio Coentrao, which transformed Misimovic.
After the rest, the 2004 European champion clarified everything with 4 goals.
The Czechs ended the final doubts in the 81st minute with a goal from Petr Jiracek.
The 1976 European champion qualified for the fifth consecutive Euro Cup.
Coach Michal Bilek’s team with Bundesliga legionaire Michael Kadlec (Bayer Leverkusen) and Tomas Pekhart (1. FC Nürnberg) also had luck and had to overcome a second of reaction in the initial phase.
At the last moment, goalkeeper Petr Cech avoided with a reflection a possible goal at Tomas Sivok’s own door (9.).
Montenegro had more chances with the duo Stevan Jovetic and Dejan Damjanovic in action.
Damjanovic scored in the 40th minute of the turn from the front, very right in the goal of Cech.
After the rest the Czechs had to protect the world-famous goalkeeper's deck, the FC Seoul forward again escaped (50).
Finally, the goal before the end decided the game.
Meanwhile, Turkey missed the miracle of Zagreb football.
Four days after the 0-3 in Istanbul, the Turks did not pass from a 0-0 in Zagreb.
While it was almost certain that national coach Guus Hiddink should abandon his seat from the 2002 World Cup third seat, the Croats celebrated their fourth participation in the Euro Cup final.
In front of 31,000 spectators at the Maksimir Stadium, the Turks achieved a dream start.
In the seventh minute and with a long-distance shot, Selcuk Inan only managed to play the deck.
After the second reaction, Croatia increasingly assumed control.
After the break, Croatia did not allow him to score a goal.
Alongside Mario Mandzukic of VfL Wolfsburg, who in the 62nd minute made place to Ivan Perisic of Dortmund, Danijel Pranjic (Bayern Munich) and Gordon Schildenfeld (Eintracht Frankfurt) are the Bundesliga legionaries in practice.
Trapattoni goes to the Euro Cup
In Dublin, the Irish celebrate the first participation in the Euro Cup since 1988 in Germany.
Stephen Ward led coach Giovanni Trapattoni’s team, who triumphed with the 4-0 in the match prepared for a preliminary decision, to head in the 32nd minute.
Konstantin Vassiljev (57) scored with the guest team.
Ireland pushed from the start, but had to wait until the 23rd minute, when Robbie Keane of Los Angeles Galaxy had his first big chance.
From the beginning, the Estonian defense avoided possible advance goals.
But in the 32nd minute he went ahead.
After a defense from goalkeeper Pavel Londak, Ward appeared and kicked the ball through the line, getting the 1-0.

Massacre on a personal level
Peter Englund’s intense and generous new book, The Beauty and the Sorrow: An Intimate Story About World War I, “begins with a long dramatis personae of the kind that can make one fall his soul to his feet.
Here are some action tips: Soak this page gently and turn it into your brand pages.
He will get to know these people very well in Mr. Englund’s novelist narrative, and this dramatis personae will function as his GPS, a beacon during those few moments in which, as one of his men and women, he is confused and helpless in the fog of war.
Mr Englund is a Swedish historian and journalist.
He is also the new permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy, which grants the Nobel Prize for Literature.
What you have written here is an unusual book, which you correctly describe as “an anti-historic work.”
It contains some notable names, important treaties or famous battles; there are virtually no ambassadors, elegant journalists, or discussions about tactics or material.
It’s not so much a book about what happened, he explains, as “a book about how it happened.”
"The Beauty and Pain of the Battle" combines the experiences in wartime of more than 20 ordinary men and women, on both sides of the war, from college and botanists to climbers, doctors, ambulance drivers and administrative.
Some of these people will become heroes.
Some will become prisoners of war, or lose their members, go crazy, or die.
Their lives flash here like votive candles lit in a church; some new ones are added to the mix while others turn off.
The book of Mr. Englund is a deviation from the standard history books.
It is also a correction to the notion that the First World War was only the fatal trincher war on the Western Front.
"The beauty and pain of the battle" moves expertly through other war theaters: the Alps, the Balkans, the Eastern Front, Mesopotamia, East Africa.
The soldiers in this book fall over the thorns; one spends Christmas in Egypt under the pyramids; the tse-tse flies are an intractable problem.
This is a thrilling book, almost from the beginning.
The war floods the lives of these people like a natural disaster, a hurricane Katrina that strikes the cord.
When the fire of artillery is heard in the distance, and you are a woman who is at home with your children, do you stay or flee?
Anyway, who is coming?
Almost no one understands what is happening, not even why this war has to be fought.
“The lack of facts,” notes Mr. Englund, “has been filled with conjecture, assumptions, hopes, fears, fixed ideas, conspiracy theories, dreams, nightmares and rumors.”
"The Beauty and Pain of the Battle" follows individuals like Florence Farmborough, an English nurse in the Russian army, and Richard Stumpf, a young German sailor in the offshore fleet.
His stories have mostly been obtained from memoirs, letters and other material already published earlier.
The explanations of their lives can be frightening or moving, but they are more full of life in the accumulation of little moments, lost details, by Mr. Englund.
Many of these are about deprivations and fixing them with what is.
About telling the story of a German schoolgirl she says: “Successful, everywhere successive.”
"Coffee successor, fake aluminum, imitation rubber, paper sales, wooden buttons."
He continues to talk about successive food in Germany.
It describes “meat made from cooked rice and pressed in carnivore fat (and finished with a fake bone made of wood); tobacco made from roots and peelings of dry potatoes; shoes with wooden soles.”
There are, he notes, “837 allowed meat substitutes in sausage production, 511 coffee substitutes registered.”
Some stories are about honor and courage.
An American recognizes his own drive toward savagery and manifests about war: "You feel that, after all, this is for what men are conceived and not to sit in chairs with a cigarette and a whisky, the afternoon newspaper or a best-seller, and pretend that that barniz means civilization and that there is no barbar behind that brick-and-mild seal."
Instead, a British soldier realizes that he will probably die, and that no one will know or care.
“Once one resigns to the thought of sacrificing himself, one would like to think that could happen in front of the public,” he writes.
Instead, it is horribly similar “to a convict being strangled in secret.”
Other observations are about an old Europe disappearing, and about new types of terror.
“The conflict has increasingly become an economic competition,” writes Mr. Englund, “a war between factories.”
It reflects the arrival of what he calls “a new species in the bestiary of the young century: The eloquent and ideologically convinced mass killer in good-dressed clothes who executes his carnage while sitting behind a desk.”
People behave in unexpected ways; there is both innoble and heroic behavior.
Mr. Englund speaks of the soldiers who actively attempted to seize a venereal disease of prostitutes as a way to evade service on the front.
"The most grotesque expression of this can be seen in the trade in gonococcal pus, which soldiers buy and embadurnan with it their genitals in the hope of ending up in the hospital," he writes.
“Those who are truly desperate rub it on their eyes, which often leads to lifelong blindness.”
In this Swedish translation by Peter Graves, Mr. Englund’s agile but not extravagant prose is perfectly adapted to his human task.
In dozens of small scenes he reflects the way the war has “unleashed exceptionally uncontrollable forces: extreme nationalism, social revolution, religious hatred.”
People start asking why their leaders are making them fight.
The best books about the First World War have often been indirect, such as The Great War and Paul Fussell's Modern Memory, or novels such as No Novel on the Front by Erich Maria Remarque, rather than integral stories.
The volume of Mr. Englund joins an unconventional pantheon.
His book has one of the most devastating endings I can remember in a non-fiction work.
I will not reveal.
But it is as if he had come from his book, pulled from between your fingers that page of dramatis personae, and burned it with a light bulb.
After a false step in advance, an assault planned per minute
Hundreds of police officers were involved, some of them wearing riot helmets.
It was chosen Monday night to Tuesday because the Zuccotti park would be more empty.
The operation was kept secret except for a few senior officers, initially telling the others they were joining an exercise.
Police inspector Raymond W. Kelly was in the center, his presence underscored how the operation was plagued with challenges for the police department.
The episodes of recent weeks, such as the spraying of pepper spray on the protesters, violating the department’s rules and creating a storm of public sympathy for the “okups”, could not be repeated.
And so the police operation to clear the Zuccotti park of protesters was revealed after two weeks of planning and training.
Officers had prepared themselves by seeing how the occupations had developed in other cities.
A major disaster simulation was taking place on Randalls Island, with one eye looking at Zuccotti.
Officers increased so-called disorder training — counterterrorism measures involving rapidly mobilizing a large number of police officers — to focus on Lower Manhattan.
The last training session was on Monday night, on the Manhattan side of the East River.
Orders to enter the park arrived at the “last minute,” said someone familiar with the orders, who referred to the mission only as “an exercise.”
“To the few policemen I know who were called for this, they were not told it was to enter the Zuccotti Park,” said the person, who spoke anonymously.
"The only people who knew they were going to enter the Zuccotti Park were at the highest levels of the department."
One reason for secrecy was a lesson learned by the city.
On October 14, officers wanted to clear the park, but gave up when hundreds of protesters came up early after hearing about the plans.
Tuesday’s operation involved agents from several police units, including special forces from across the municipal district – dozens of mobile agents who used to flood high-crime neighborhoods.
Mr. Kelly said many people, like those who travel daily to work, had been going and coming out of the park during the day, making 1 a.m. a good time to get in.
“It was appropriate to do it when there was the least number of people in the park,” he said.
Trucks from the Emergency Services Unit with headphones and speakers gathered at the crossroads of Pike Slip with Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive, near the Manhattan Bridge, before leaving.
The lights and pregrabed messages that sounded from the loudspeakers seemed to intimidate many protesters.
Community affairs agents went to the park with their bright blue windshields, many protesters simply picked up their things and left.
No store was touched until 1:45 a.m., police said, giving protesters time to collect their belongings.
Other teams of agents were seen gathering in the perimeter to enter if it was necessary to make stops in the park.
Journalists in the park were forced to abandon it.
Paul J. Browne, the police department’s chief spokesman, said it was for his safety.
But many journalists said they were tried to prevent them from seeing the police come into action in the park, and that they had been treated abruptly by the agents.
Mr. Browne said mobile television units on Church Street, along the western edge of the park, were able to capture images.
As police moved west through the demonstrators' dense wreck of personal items, including luggage and paper and plastic garbage bags packed with clothes, cleaning department teams followed them, collecting what was left behind.
Some protesters who refused to move were dragged out, appearing images on the Internet shortly after.
A central group of protesters took positions near the camp’s kitchen area, near the center of the park.
Some made a barrier, and the police entered to arrest them methodically.
Around 10 people in the epicenter of the camp were hanging in their arms.
And two people were chained to trees, said Mr. Kelly.
Emergency officers were called to cut off the locks.
No arrests were made in the park until about 3:30 a.m., Mr. Kelly said.
The evacuation operation was completed about 75 minutes later, police said.
Mr. Browne said about 142 people were arrested in the park.
Most of the arrests were for "altering public order and resistance to authority," he said.
The highest-ranking agent on the scene was Joseph J. Espósito, the head of the department, the senior uniformed officer in the department.
Phil T. Pulaski, the chief detective of the department, was also there.
Mr. Kelly, while present, “was not directing the operations,” Mr. Browne said.
A second group of agents waited along the eastern side of Broadway, between Liberty and Cedar streets, in case they had to enter.
Barricades were erected on Cortlandt Street, a block north of the park, and on Pine Street, a block south.
From those positions, police were seen widening the perimeter even beyond the Zuccotti Park.
At one point, a series of agents, many of them with shields, were seen pushing people out.
There were about 28 people on the northern perimeter.
Some of the hottest action of the night took place south of the park.
Around 5 a.m., south of Pine Street, a demonstrator jumped over the hood of a police car, and others were seen taking the air from the wheels of a police van.
At a certain point, a piece of counterchaping came out flying from the crowd.
A police officer and a demonstrator were hospitalized.
Workers' Union to Appeal City for Dismissal
The union representing hundreds of school support workers who lost their jobs last month plans to sue the city on Wednesday, arguing that the dismissals were unnecessary and discriminatory due to their disproportionate impact on schools that serve poor students.
The lawsuit is, possibly, the last weapon at the disposal of the union, of the municipal district 37, in its effort to revoke the dismissals.
Six hundred and seventy-two school assistants, parent coordinators and other employees who were among the city’s worst-paid lost their jobs on October 7, in a movement that trade union leaders have described as a political revenge for their refusal to allow, last spring, access by the city to a health care fund undertaken by working groups to close its budget gap.
The municipal authorities have categorically denied this accusation.
At a City Hall hearing last month, education counselor Dennis M. Walcott said the dismissals were part of the budget approved in June.
A board member counterattacked him by saying that nothing in the budget specified that school support staff members would be fired.
37 municipal district officials said they filed the complaint in writing, warning the Department of Education that it would be sued.A press conference will be held on Wednesday to announce the official filing of the complaint, at the State Supreme Court in Manhattan.
The lawsuit will include Mr. Walcott and the City Education Department as accused, and includes eight workers fired as plaintiffs, all black or Latin women, as well as most of the assistants who lost their jobs.
Elizabeth Thomas, a spokeswoman for the city’s Legal Department, said the city had not seen the lawsuit and could therefore not comment on its specific claims.
According to a draft of the lawsuit obtained by The New York Times, the union has focused on the number of dismissals in schools in poor areas of the city to support a claim for unfair treatment, saying that poor schools lost more attendants as they had been chronically insufficiently subsidized.
It is noted that while there were no dismissals in Staten Island and a few dismissals in schools in the Upper East Side or TriBeCa, 17 school attendants lost their jobs in District 23 in Brownsville, Brooklyn, and 46 were dismissed in Districts 8 and 9 in the Southern Bronx.
Given the loss of five of the eight assistants employed by the 36 Public School in Harlem, where 68 percent of students live in poverty, the demand says, “This is not a neighborhood of wealthy parents who can raise funds to cover the budget deficit.”
P.D. District 36 budget was reduced by 3.26 percent this year, and also lost money when the city changed the way it calculates additional funding for each poor student enrollment in schools.
The union also claims that secondary school directors may have been deceived by language in a memorandum authorizing the dismissal of parent coordinators.
The memorandum used the word "excess" to describe the action, although "excess" more often describes the act of transferring a teacher from a school's salary to a workforce, whose salaries are paid by the central office.
“Sixy-six parental coordinators were fired,” says the draft complaint, “and not just in surplus.”
Mission completed, Congress ready to reach agreement on Libya
It seems that finally Republicans and Democrats in the Capitol are willing to agree on something related to the uprising in Libya.
All it needed was that the rebellion succeeded, that veteran dictator Muammar Gaddafi was captured and murdered, and that U.S. involvement came to an end.
On Tuesday, the Senate Foreign Affairs Committee will consider a resolution, sponsored by President John Kerry (Democrat for Massachusetts), along with Senators John McCain (Republican for Arizona) and Joseph I. Lieberman (independent for Connecticut), applauding the Libyans for their successful rebellion and U.S. troops for their "courage".
"This resolution is to honor Libya's brave people, as they begin to rebuild their country," Kerry said.
“It’s an affirmation of bipartisan support for their democratic aspirations.”
The language may seem harmless, but nothing about the debate about Libya has been easy so far.
This summer, lawmakers from both parties were fighting with each other and the White House over drafting a series of resolutions to approve or reject the role of the U.S. military in the NATO mission in Libya.
In June, Kerry and McCain submitted a resolution authorizing the limited use of U.S. military forces in Libya.
The bill was defeated in the House by a wide bipartisan margin, and was never voted in the Senate.
But the same day that the bill was rejected in the House, the House also rejected a measure that would have cut funds for U.S. operations in Libya.
That left the US mission in a kind of legislative purgatory – with Congress annoying enough to criticize Obama’s handling of the mission, but not so angry as to actually grind the grass under his feet.
Then the indecision of Congress was overcome by events.
Tripoli fell into the hands of Libyan rebels in August, and Gaddafi was assassinated on October 20.
The NATO mission officially ended on October 31.
Now the Senate could be ready to act.
The Foreign Affairs Committee’s resolution “felicites the people of Libya for their tremendous courage and extraordinary resistance to free themselves” and “elogies the men and women of the U.S. Armed Forces and their coalition partners who participated in military operations to protect the people of Libya for their extraordinary courage and professionalism.”
The resolution also “declares the national interest of the United States in a successful and irreversible transition to democracy in Libya.”
Will the new measure win the full support of the Foreign Affairs Committee, or will it divide lawmakers like the June bill did?
The latest version was rejected by Senator Richard G. Lugar (Indiana), the principal Republican of the committee.
The spokesman for Lugar said on Monday that he had not yet seen the final version of the new bill.
On the other side of the Capitol, the House will vote this week on a constitutional amendment demanding a balanced budget, a legislative priority for almost all Republican congressmen and some Democrats.
The measure, sponsored by Republican Bob Goodlatte (Republican for Virginia), will be the first constitutional amendment on the budget or any other issue that in fact achieves a vote of the entire assembly in the House or the Senate in this Congress.
Other lawmakers have so far failed to bring their amendments to the assembly, but not for lack of attempts.
The Goodlatte amendment is just one of the 68 constitutional amendments that have been introduced at this Congress, covering a wide range of topics.
Some are duplicate — the same bill is proposed both in the House and in the Senate — and others with slight variations between themselves.
There are at least 15 versions of the budget balance amendment just in the House, and another handful that “will control federal spending.”
Some of those bills are also identical to each other, but they give their sponsors—especially novice Republicans seeking to refine their curricula—the opportunity to boast that they were the “authors” of such a measure.
The Budget Control Act, which was passed in August, required both the House and the Senate to vote on an amendment to the budget balance.
In March, 58 senators voted in favour of a non-binding resolution supporting the idea of that amendment.
Beyond the budget, several members want to limit the number of terms that members of Congress can fulfill, while representative José E. Serrano (Democrat for New York), wants to remove the limit of two terms for presidents.
Representative Jesse L. Jackson Jr. (Democrat for Illinois) has proposed a series of amendments that guarantee the right to quality education and health care, among other issues.
An amendment that prohibits same-sex marriage is a perennial proposal, as well as one that prohibits flagsburning.
Some lawmakers also want to allow the cancellation of federal laws if they are rejected by two-thirds of the states.
So enthusiastic that members have been proposing amendments, they are not moving at a faster pace than in previous years.
In the 111th Congress, lawmakers proposed 77 amendments, and submitted 66 in the 110th.
The pace is unacceptable compared to that of the 1990s, when members regularly submitted more than 150 amendments every two years, according to figures provided by the Senate Library.
But they were not much more successful then than they are now.
The last amendment that was added - the 27th - was ratified in 1992, but in fact was proposed by Congress in 1789.
"Balled but not defeated," Giffords speaks in her first TV interview since the shooting
Ten months after a gunman shot him on fire at a constituent rally in Tucson, representative Gabrielle Giffords (Democrat for Arizona) appeared on national television on Monday night, singing accompanied by the Broadway song "The Sun Will Rise Tomorrow" and said she wanted to recover more than she wanted to return to Congress.
In her appearance on ABC News "20/20", with Diane Sawyer, Giffords struggled to form prayers and needed help to walk.
The show documented his difficult way back from the damage caused by a bullet that broke his skull and perforated the left side of his brain, and that passed from the forehead to the back of his head.
Three months ago, he came back by surprise to the House to issue his triumphant vote on the debt ceiling agreement.
In his first television interview since the January shooting, which killed six and wounded 13, Giffords smiled, laughed and sang — and described his recovery as “difficult.”
When Sawyer asked him how he felt, Giffords, 41, replied, “Good enough.”
The interview with Giffords and her husband, astronaut Mark Kelly, was part of a one-hour special "20/20" program, which aired on the eve of the publication of the couple's new book, "Gabby: A Story of Courage and Hope."
The special program looked at Giffords' recovery from the January 8 shooting.
In videos recorded by Kelly in the first few weeks, she is seen in her hospital bed, with her head shaved and a long scarring crossing her forehead.
She can only keep one or two fingers up, while her husband encourages her.
Months later, Giffords is seen sitting on a wheelchair while therapists teach her how to perform simple actions.
A movement of the head.
A scratch of the lips.
And then his first word: “What.”
Within a few days, Giffords pronounced another word - "tostada", a request for change in his breakfast menu.
Videos broadcast by ABC show that the music played a central role in Giffords' recovery: The congresswoman is seen singing along with the therapists the songs "Girls Just Wanna Have Fun" by Cyndi Lauper and "Free Falling" by Tom Petty.
In an interview with Sawyer, Giffords, who does two hours of therapy every day, said he doesn't remember the day of the shooting.
Her husband said he was reading Giffords a newspaper article about the March 12 murder when she stopped him to ask for the first time about the six who had died in the incident.
The suspect gunman, Jared Lee Loughner, is detained in a Missouri prison and is being forcibly medicated while awaiting trial.
“A lot of people died,” Giffords told Sawyer.
“Hard, hard and hard.”
Kelly told Sawyer that at a time of his wife's recovery, she said, "I've been defeated."
“So, I said, ‘Gabby, you haven’t been defeated,’” Kelly said.
“You have been beaten.
And you’re going to get out of this, and you’re going to recover and you’re going to come back stronger than ever.”
They make me feel more sorry than respectful.
The event was a Wall Street gala that raised millions of dollars for homeless veterans in New York.
Kid Rock sang a ballad about impotence, frustration and loss.
At that time, several hundred soldiers, sailors, aviators and naval infants stormed into their positions around him.
The label crowd stood up and applauded.
“Men and women were considered heroes,” said David Saltzman, who organized the spring fundraising.
A high-ranking military officer at the gala, also known as the then President of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Admiral Mike Mullen, saw the role of troops differently.
"They showed them like a kind of orphan child," the officer wrote in an email.
I am sure the organizers had good intentions.
I know they had them.
But it wasn’t respect, really, it was a pity.
The markedly contradictory impressions illustrate the difficult relationship that has been seized between the military and a often distant, sometimes adoring, American public.
The soldiers are praised for their sacrifices.
But praise has a price, the service members say.
The public is acting more and more as if they were sorry for those uniforms.
"We are not victims at all," said Brigadier General Sean B. MacFarland, who commanded the troops in Iraq and will soon depart for Afghanistan.
“But it seems that the only way for some to show their support is to put ourselves in the role of helpless souls.”
The subject is a very sensitive topic for military leaders, who do not want to appear ungrateful or disagree with the public they serve.
They also realize that the anger faced by the troops who returned in the last years of the Vietnam War was much worse.
As a result, most conversations about pity take place in silence and in private among war veterans.
After their two sons returned from fighting with the Navy Infantry, retired Colonel Mark Cancian warned them that people apart from the military would consider their service from two perspectives.
Some would look at them with a feeling of fear because they faced the insurgents and traveled to exotic places.
Others would wonder if there would be a “irritated and violent veteran under the surface,” said Cancian, who fought in Iraq and returned to a high-level government job in Washington.
During his job search, he said, he felt that some interviewers had subtly asked him if he would be able to withstand the pressure of a demanding work from Washington immediately after his combat tour.
“When you talk about your service, you need to deal with negative impressions,” Cancian recalled telling his children.
The military unrest arises, in part, from the American indifference to wars.
Achievements on the battlefield are rarely chosen for praise by a country that has little familiarity with the military and sees few direct benefits from the wars of Iraq and Afghanistan.
“We, as a nation, no longer value military heroism in ways that were quite common in World War II,” said retired Lieutenant General David Barno, who commanded U.S. troops in Afghanistan.
On the other hand, praise from politicians and the public focuses largely on the depth of the suffering of a member of the service.
Troops are recognized by the number of turns they have endured, the number of friends they have lost, or the extent of their injuries.
The army faces growing pressure to end rape
This week, a historic hearing will decide whether 28 women and men have a case against the army for their alleged passivity before the rape.
If not, hundreds of applicants are organizing for the next.
First Soldier Elizabeth Lyman was 25 years and 11 weeks pregnant the night she says she was raped by a partner.
It was October 2008, and he was heading back to his headquarters at Miramar Air Base, north of San Diego, after dinner with a friend when he met a colleague carrying a pack of 12 bottles of beer.
He asked if he could join her in her room for a drink.
“It sounded an alarm,” says Lyman.
However, the native of Texas left her concerns aside.
I thought, no, he is 19.
“It’s from Texas,” he says.
“I wish I had listened to my instincts.”
Within minutes of entering Lyman's room, the man approached her from behind, tossing her down and raping her, he claims.
This week, on November 18, Lyman and 27 other current and former military personnel are eagerly awaiting a court ruling at a historic trial in Arlington, Virginia, that will decide whether their lawsuit against former Defense Secretary Robert Gates and his predecessor, Donald Rumsfeld, will go to trial.
The lawsuit claims that Gates and Rumsfeld failed to reduce widespread rape among the military, in violation of the constitutional rights of the soldiers.
Submitted in February by Susan Burke, a Washington, D.C. lawyer, the lawsuit initially involved 17 defendants, but grew to 28 in the following months, 25 women and three men, all of whom claim that they were raped or sexually assaulted by their peers, and that the military failed to investigate, prosecute, or give proper justice after the alleged assaults.
Burke says he goes to the army’s major plateau, because the problem begins with them.
“The army is a top-down structure,” he says.
"Who are the people who are in a position to eradicate the culture of retaliation?
Burke also says that since February, about 400 more survivors have been contacted with her, many of whom could be part of future lawsuits.
Your strategy: Instead of accumulating all the applicants in this case, putting all the eggs in a single basket, so to speak, you will present several cases, if necessary, to maintain the pressure.
The defense team for the Defense Department, headed by federal prosecutor Neil MacBride, has filed a motion to dismiss the case.
The court documents, obtained by Newsweek, detail the defense strategy – essentially, that the military cannot be sued by current or former soldiers for injuries suffered in the armed forces.
By a 1950 Supreme Court ruling called the Feres Doctrine, the federal government is not responsible for damages suffered by active personnel.
“The alleged damages are part of the applicants’ military service,” the documents say.
The Defense Department declined to comment on this article.
Things have changed since the 1950s.
While women are still officially prohibited from serving in combat, this distinction is only nominal: Modern wars rarely have clear frontlines.
Both in Iraq and Afghanistan, female soldier teams are playing increasingly important roles, especially to reach local women in war zones.
The result: between those two wars, 150 women soldiers have died and two-thirds of them in combat situations.
It’s time for the army to modernize too, says Burke.
She is not alone in her struggle, and three other demands are underway, in addition to her own.
At Yale Law School, the Veterans Legal Services Clinic is preparing a case against the four leading military academies for allegedly promoting a misogynistic environment.
On the other hand, the non-profit organization Vietnam Veterans of America is compiling a lawsuit against the army that focuses on the “personality disorder” diagnoses assigned to rape victims in order to let them go of service – a common event, according to activists, such as Anu Bhagwati of the Women in Service Action Network, a human rights group.
His group filed a lawsuit in December against the Veterans Administration, accusing it of discriminatory practices in the way it handles benefits claims for people who say they have been sexually assaulted at the service.
Nine separate bills have been submitted to Congress by a bipartisan blend of senators and representatives, proposing a series of corrections.
In 2010, there were 3,158 sexual assaults, according to the Office for the Prevention of Sexual Aggression and Response of the Department of Defense.
However, the attacks are notably underreported, and by the Pentagon’s own estimates, which accounted for approximately 13.5 percent of the estimated 19,000 incidents that occurred that year.
The report, published in March, also examines processing rates: in 2010, 20 percent of cases in the military were brought to trial – half that in the civil justice system.
The plaintiffs in the Burke case describe their attacks as only the first of a series of traumas.
In Lyman’s case, she the alleged rape to military police less than an hour after it occurred.
That night, she says, she was asked to tell the details of her rape 11 different times to a crowd of police, doctors, and commanders.
She underwent a rape kit, and her assailant's blood - from a cut in her arm - was found in her bed.
Six months later, in April 2009, Lyman attended an audience before a judge, during which he was asked about having had sex with his boyfriend on the day of the attack.
Six people declared as personality witnesses on behalf of the alleged perpetrator, who was eventually acquitted.
“I remember the day the verdict was read,” Lyman says.
“I thought I was going to work – I found myself screaming from the room.”
“They put me in the psychiatric unit, and when I left, I remember I said to my commander, ‘That wasn’t your judgment.
Lyman was ordered to visit a military psychiatrist, who eventually diagnosed a personality disorder, which made her unfit for service.
In January 2010 she was dismissed from the service under less-than-honorable terms, which prevents her from receiving any benefit.
As for whether the case filed by Lyman and his fellow prosecutors continues, it’s a very remote possibility, says John Turley, a professor of law at George Washington School of Law.
However, he notes, “In my opinion, they should be able to move forward.”
What is interposed between them and a verdict is this doctrine that has been criticized since it was first published.
I have been a constant critic of the Feres Doctrine.
The army is decades behind because it does not have the same incentive and deterrence that liability poses.
And he adds: “The odds are strongly against them... but it’s important for them to try it.”
These things only change when good people are willing to fight.
If the hearing doesn’t go its way, Burke, the plaintiffs’ lawyer, will catch up with his hundreds of other plaintiffs for future cases.
“We will continue to fight against the army on this issue until the reform comes about,” he says.
Or until we die, whatever happens first.
Walls Have Eyes: How Researchers Are Studying You on Facebook
Before becoming the new face of the far right in Europe, Anders Behring Breivik was just another guy airing his anti-immigration views online.
On Monday, Breivik, who admitted to carrying out a July Norwegian massacre that killed 77 people, faced his first public court hearing.
While Breivik may have acted alone, he was far from alone in cyberspace: He had spent most of the time that preceded his attack in front of his computer, chatting with some of the millions of nationalists who support right-wing groups on social media.
After the tragedy this summer, researchers wanted to know more about these people.
But how to find them?
Easy – you just have to log in to Facebook.
“We realized that it wasn’t so hard to get to them,” says Jamie Bartlett, lead author of a recent report published on European digital populism by the British study centre DEMOS.
Bartlett says that Facebook’s personal information leak is so encyclopedic that researchers could simply use the advertising tool to determine their desired demographic characteristics with scientific accuracy – the way sellers have been using it for years.
Bartlett’s team found half a million fans of right-wing groups across Europe and then targeted them ads, but instead of linking them to a new band or diet product, the ads invited users to complete a survey asking about their educational level, attitudes toward violence and optimism about their own future.
By coming through Facebook, Bartlett and colleagues were able to study more than 10,000 followers from 14 far-right parties in 11 European countries — all without leaving the office.
“It’s an entirely new way of doing research,” says Bartlett.
Some of the results are not entirely surprising: Online supporters of right-wing groups tend to be young, male and angry about immigration.
However, in a kind of twist, “those who combine their online activism with offline activism are more reasonable, more democratic and less violent than those who stay behind the computer screen.”
The work of DEMOS is just one example of how Facebook is becoming a new and important tool in the hands of scientists.
Research centers, medical researchers and political scientists are using the site to study everything from health issues to social trends as expressed in “Like”, wall messages and state updates.
With more than 800 million active users adding an average of three pieces of content a day, Facebook’s “data supernova” is generating a boost in research, boosting the number of academic papers with the site’s name on the title to almost 800% over the past five years.
For some researchers, the beauty of Facebook is that it allows you to study people you couldn’t approach with a folder on the street.
"Before, when you tried to survey people from the British National Party, it was very difficult to identify them."
“You’d have to go through the game, and they’d never allow you access,” says Bartlett.
“Facebook removes all that – you go to them directly.”
Others say the site could provide a way to identify and address health-social issues.
A recent study by Dr. Megan Moreno of the University of Wisconsin-Madison and her colleagues found that college students who spoke about their drunkenness feats on Facebook had a significantly higher risk of having drunkenness problems than students who remained silent about the subject.
Moreno suggests that fellow students, such as residential counselors, could control the site and intervene to help a student who publishes too many state updates with their drinks.
“You can’t treat a problem if you can’t diagnose it,” said Dimitri Christakis, co-author of Moreno and director of the Center for Child Health, Behavior and Development at the Seattle Institute for Childhood Research.
“We’ve found a way to identify children at risk that otherwise’t be diagnosed.”
Facebook is also constantly “popping” its own population to obtain data.
The Site Data Team has compiled statistics on the status of the relationship and Valentine’s Day, the expectation of election participation in the middle of the 2010 legislative period, and a National Happiness Index (mainly using the information that can be accessed – advocates of digital freedom have long argued that the site should make available to others its large amount of data for research).
However, Facebook users know that the site is watching them, like it or not – the sacrifice of being able to play Scrabble with a friend thousands of miles away is allowing the site to mine your personal information.
But what happens when Facebook users become part of a survey they don’t even know about?
While researchers have well-defined guidelines on how to collect your data offline, online is a free bar for everyone.
“I don’t think many of the users have even thought about the fact that a researcher might be examining their profiles,” says Neil Selwyn, a sociologist at London’s Knowledge Laboratory, on a 2006 study he conducted with public Facebook walls of students.
“As far as they were concerned, it was only between them and their friends.”
Then there is the question of methodology.
Even offline, there is no guarantee that a research topic is being completely honest.
On Facebook, it’s impossible to know that part of a user’s profile information and wall messages are true.
“What you say on Facebook and what you do outside of Facebook are two completely different things,” says Selwyn.
That’s why, despite his years as a technology researcher, Selwyn believes that a paper subject and a pen is still the best research tools that no one can use.
“There’s no substitute for entering the real world and talking to real people,” he says.
“Social research is supposed to be about the social – and a lot of the social still happens offline.”
Cold and Inhumane: Anders Behring Breivik makes his first public appearance in court
Anders Behring Breivik, the man who confessed to being the brain of the two attacks that killed 77 people in Norway this summer, has described himself as a "resistance" fighter during his first public appearance at the Oslo court.
"I am a military commander in the Norwegian resistance movement and in the Norwegian Templar Knights," he said in front of a room full of 500 people.
“I oppose the court, because it received the mandate from organizations that support the ideology of hatred and because it supports multiculturalism.”
“I acknowledge the facts, but I do not declare myself guilty.”
Judge Torkjel Nesheim interrupted Breivik during that monologue, because "he did not want to give Breivik the opportunity to use this audience as a platform for him to express his views."
For the same reason, he refused to allow Breivik, who delivered a written speech in advance, to address the families of his victims at the end of the hearing.
Nesheim also ordered police to keep Breivik in custody for another 12 weeks, banned him from accessing the media for four weeks, and said authorities would have to have strict control over all visits and correspondence for eight weeks.
Around 30 survivors and families of the victims attended the hearing.
Some came with the hope of looking Breivik in the eyes, others to confirm that he is locked under the key.
Everyone attended with the aim of moving towards the conclusion.
“I thought it looked cold and inhumane,” a Utoya survivor told Norwegian broadcaster NRK.
"It was uncomfortable, but for me it was a step forward after seeing and hearing the suspect."
Dressed in a dark suit and blue tie, Breivik remained calm and professional throughout the audience and looked journalists and survivors in the eyes as he entered and left the building.
Despite Breivik's strange notion of being part of a larger "resistance" movement, the judge determined that he is not a mental ill, and said there is no evidence that he acted with complicit.
It may comfort some that the July 22 attacks seem to be the work of an extremist rather than a group of radicals.
But that doesn’t automatically soften the pain and confusion that an entire nation still feels.
“I would like it to look like a monster, but it doesn’t look like it,” one of the victim’s relatives said.
“It would be much easier if it seemed.”
7 Lessons From Steve Jobs' Lost Interview, Showing In A Theatre This Week
After Steve Jobs’ death on October 5, there were some who compared him to Henry Ford – distinguishing the technology genius as the Great Modern Inventor.
But what Apple fans might find more revealing, in a recently rediscovered interview with Jobs that has been unleashed as a prequel to a series of special projections in the major markets this week, is how much this creative mind understood about business processes and product workflows.
He was undoubtedly a self-recognised designer, dreamer and hippie, but he was also a meticulous organizer and a flow chart yonki – a man who believed that many executives suffered “a disease that consists of thinking that a great idea is 90 percent of the work... [but] there is a huge amount of work between a great idea and a great product.”
In 1995, Bob Cringely was developing the television series The Triumph of the Nerds on the dawn of the personal computer, and he sat for more than an hour with Jobs for an extensive and rare conversation.
At that time, it had been scarcely 10 years since Jobs had been forced to leave Apple, and he was already working intensively on his new computer company NeXT, waiting for the popular adoption of the Internet.
While a small portion of Cringely's interview was used in Nerds, he said the originals of the interview disappeared during his transport.
It was only after Jobs' death that a full VHS copy was discovered in the director's garage.
This archival material, slightly re-released, is the basis for Steve Jobs: The Lost Interview, 68 minutes, which arrives on Landmark cinemas this Wednesday and Thursday.
For someone known for hating in-depth interviews, Jobs here seems surprisingly willing to expose his technological philosophies and business strategies.
And very thoughtful.
At four different points throughout the interview, there are large silences between questions and answers – from 10 to 15 seconds of reflections, where Jobs is clearly weighing his thoughts, seeking precision.
There are also times when Jobs’ perfectionism comes to the surface, where he seems impatient because of Cringely’s questions, pushing him to go faster toward topics or arguments of greater importance.
Filmed before the era of Pixar, the iPod or the iPhone, there’s something strangely prophetic in The Lost Interview, when Jobs evaluates what he sees other companies do well and bad, and offers his own vision of the future of computing.
One thing is to read posthumous reviews of Jobs’ career, but there’s something raw and inspiring in the Jobs we see here, the anxious dreamer on the verge of greatness.
He has a vision of how things can and should be.
Not long after explaining it all in detail here, it was and it did.
A quick summary of seven remarkable sequences of The Lost Interview:
How you learned to run a business:
“Over the years in the business, I’ve always asked, ‘Why do you do things?’ and the answers they invariably give you are, ‘Oh, that’s just how it’s done.’
Nobody knows why he does what he does, in business nobody thinks about things very deeply.
That is what I found.
Jobs brings to detail his efforts to simplify Apple’s accounting.
Confused by the way costs were recorded – often starting with a “standard cost” that was made to the eye of a good man, and then adjusted with a “variable” – he developed an automated factory that ensured that they could determine commercial costs in detail.
The Jokes of the Pope:
Jobs tells the “Blue Box” he himself built with Steve Wozniak – a device that allowed people to effectively hack the phone company and make long-distance calls for free.
It has been widely written about the device, but Jobs’ euphoria here in describing the Blue Box as an act of empowerment is contagious.
He describes how he and Wozniak tested the box using a public phone, making a call, and then connecting from one AT&T network to another, while creating a loop with as many satellites as possible.
“We were wrapping things around the world half a dozen times and screaming through the public phone and returning a minute later to the public phone from the next door,” Jobs says with a laugh.
“We were young and what we learned was that we could build something ourselves that could control billions of dollars in infrastructure around the world.”
We both, we didn’t know much, but we could build a small thing that could control a giant thing – it was an incredible lesson, and I don’t think Apple would ever have existed without it.
Jobs continues to describe a glorious joke he and Wozniak almost abandon, calling the Vatican through the Blue Box in the middle of the night and asking to talk to the Pope, while doing his best imitation of Henry Kissinger.
As several members of the Catholic hierarchy were summoned in the middle of the night to talk to the American diplomat, the two exploded in clashes just before the very Pope was awakened to go and answer the phone.
About falling in love with technology (and selling by phone with Bill Hewlett):
At the age of 12, on the hunt for spare parts to build a frequency meter, he searched for Bill Hewlett in the phone guide and made him a call.
Shortly after his 20-minute telephone conversation, Jobs got a part-time summer job at Hewlett-Packard.
“That was a remarkable influence on me, it was the only company I had seen at that age and it shaped my vision of what a company was and how well they treated their employees.”
Jobs later became one of HP employees who visited the company's research laboratories in Palo Alto, where he saw "the first desktop computer ever made."
It was as big as a suitcase, it had a small cathod tube screen, and I fell in love with it.
He would make a trip to HP as a teenager and would waste time with that machine and write programs for her.
Improving the Innovation:
In several points of the interview, Jobs talks about inventing new products on the march.
Soon in his career, as he devoted himself to selling a handful of base plates, he was asked by a customer if he could mount the entire equipment.
Working with just 30 credit days, I had to find out the assembly and delivery of the finished devices.
Later, while at Apple, he recalls the struggles he faced in developing a computer mouse:
“I remember having dramatic arguments ... they shouted to me that it would take five years [to create a mouse that would cost $300], and I tired and went out and found a designer.
Ninety days later, we had a mouse that we could build for $15 and that was totally reliable.
Large companies are losing strength:
Long before he led the rebirth of Apple, Jobs prophetically predicted how many industry leaders would stumble upon their vision, and lose control of their market share.
"Say you work at IBM or Xerox, so you make better photocopies and printers, and what?"
You have the monopoly of market share, so the company has no more success.
Sales and marketing departments increase success, so it’s this type of people who end up leading and people in charge of products are kicked out of the forum for decision making.
The genius of the products that led to that monopoly position dried up by the fault of people who do not have the notion of good products versus bad products - the knowledge of the necessary craft.
That’s what happened at Xerox.
Xerox could have taken over the entire computer industry.
It could have been ten times its size, it could have been the Microsoft of the 90s...
They took the defeat of victory.
Innovation as an artistic expression:
“There is an enormous amount of work between a great idea and a great product... as the great idea evolves, it changes and grows.”
You learn a lot about the subtleties of it.
There are sacrifices you have to make – some things you can’t do that the electrons do, the glass does them, the robots do them, the factories do them.
You have to keep 5000 things in your brain – these concepts – adjust them all at once...
At the end of the day, everything is reduced to taste—you try to expose yourself to the best that a team of humans has done, and then try to adapt those things to what you are doing.
Picasso said good artists copy, great artists steal.
We’ve never been ashamed of stealing great ideas.
What partly made the Macintosh great was that the people who were working on it were musicians, poets, artists, zoologists, historians, who casually were the best computer scientists in the world.
If it wasn’t for computer science, it might be doing wonderful things in other fields.
Scalia and Thomas dinner with health care law rivals while the court accepts the case
On the day that the Supreme Court met behind closed doors to examine the politically controversial question of whether they would accept President Obama’s challenge to the health care law, two of his magistrates, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, were presented at a dinner sponsored by the lawyers’ firm that will present the case to the high court.
The occasion was last Thursday, when the nine judges met in a preliminary hearing to thoroughly study the revision petitions.
One of the cases in question was a lawsuit filed by 26 states challenging the total health care reform passed by Congress last year, a law that has been a cry of war for conservative activists across the country.
The magistrates agreed to admit the lawsuit to trial and, in fact, a historic allegation of 5 and a half hours is expected for March, and the outcome is likely to upset the 2012 presidential race even more, which will be at its height when the court’s decision is known.
The lawyer who will appear in court and argue that the law should be rejected will probably be Paul Clement, who served as U.S. Attorney General during George W. Bush’s administration.
Clement’s law firm, Bancroft PLLC, was one of two dozen companies that helped sponsor the annual dinner of the Federalist Society, a group that has been dedicated to defending conservative legal principles for many years.
Another firm that sponsored the dinner, Jones Day, represents one of the trade associations that challenged the law, the National Federation of Independent Businesses.
Another sponsor was the pharmaceutical giant Pfizer Inc., which has a huge financial interest in the outcome of the litigation.
The dinner took place in a Washington hotel, hours after the court’s preliminary hearing on the case.
Among the attendees was, among others, Mitch McConnell, the most important Republican in the Senate and a declared opponent of the health care law.
Special guests at dinner? – Scalia and Thomas.
It’s nothing new: The two judges have been attending Federalist Society events for years.
This is not in conflict with ethical norms.
In fact, judges are exempt from the Code of Conduct governing the actions of lower federal magistrates.
If they were not, it could be said that they would fall under Canon Code 4C, which says: “A judge can attend events to raise funds from law-related organizations and others, although the judge cannot be a speaker, an honorary guest, or appear on the program of such an event.”
However, Scalia’s and Thomas’s absolute proximity to two of the law firms in the case, as well as a company with a huge financial interest, was enough to alarm ethics activists in the government.
“This impressive gap in ethics and indifference to the code goes against the demands of several magistrates that adhere to the court by the same rules that apply to all federal judges,” said Bob Edgar, the president of Common Cause (Common Cause).
“The judges were gifted in a gala fundraising with lawyers who have cases pending in court.”
Their appearance and assistance in fundraising for this event undermines any demand for impartiality, and is unacceptable.
Scalia and Thomas have shown little interest in critics who say they mix court activity too easily with the agenda driven by groups like the Federalist Society.
Thomas’s wife, Ginni, is a prominent conservative activist.
On the other hand, Conservatives argue that it is Magistrate Elena Kagan, who has an ethical problem, not Scalia and Thomas.
Kagan worked as attorney general for the Obama administration when the first legal challenges to the law were presented in the court of first instance.
Her critics have pressured Kagan to refrain from seeing the case, saying she was too involved in defending the law to be impartial now.
Kagan has given no indication that he will do so.
Boeing receives record $18 billion order
Emirates has ordered 50 double-corridor Boeing 777 aircraft, with an option of 20 more.
Boeing also sells six Boeing Dreamliner aircraft to Oman Air, a deal valued at more than $1 billion.
Rarely is news when a company gets an order of 50 units of its product.
But it’s a big deal when the company is the aircraft manufacturer Boeing Co. and the sale price for the 50 aircraft rises to a record $18 billion.
It’s as big as the place where Boeing received the order: the Middle East, a growing gold mine of future aircraft orders.
In a study released on Monday, the Chicago airline estimates that over the next 20 years, airlines in the Middle East will need 2,520 aircraft worth $450 billion.
Boeing announced during the weekend its largest order in history for commercial aircraft by its value in dollars – 50 double-corridor Boeing 777 jets.
The successful order came from the airline Emirates in Dubai.
The airline also has an option to buy 20 more aircraft, which would raise the total sale price to $26 billion, Boeing announced at the 2011 Dubai Air Show.
Then on Monday, Boeing said Oman Air had ordered six Boeing 787-8s, the so-called Dreamliner, which boasts fuel savings and spectacular passenger services.
The selling price for six of them is more than $1 billion.
"This clearly has a huge positive effect for Boeing," said Morningstar analyst Neal Dihora.
“The quality of these customers in particular is very strong.”
Many airlines in the Middle East are owned by their oil producing nations.
Therefore, not only do they have the money to pay for the planes, but an increase in fuel prices – usually detrimental to airlines, because it’s one of the highest costs – is not so detrimental, because the country is making money with rising oil prices.
That’s important because they’re less likely than other airlines to cancel or delay flight orders when fuel prices rise, Dihora said.
“They have natural protection,” he said.
The Emirates order solidifies Boeing’s leadership in the wide fuselage aircraft market and helps keep its competitor Airbus SAS’ attempt to invade its dominance with the A350 passenger aircraft.
Boeing’s victory at the air fair comes four months after Airbus said it would delay the debut of the largest A350, which competes directly with the 777-300ER.
It delayed the debut to add more momentum after customers demanded an increase in load and range.
Boeing Co’s shares rose 1.5 percent to $67.94.
Mexico's president's sister defeated in Michoacán vote
Luisa María Calderón claims that the drug traffickers helped her PRI opponent, Fausto Vallejo, in the battle for governor.
President Felipe Calderón’s sister appears to have lost her candidacy for governor of Michoacán during the violent state’s elections, and she claimed on Monday that drug traffickers helped tilt the race in favor of one of her opponents.
Preliminary results led the race for governor of the western state to Fausto Vallejo, of the Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI.
"The intervention of organized crime throughout the electoral process and, especially yesterday, is alarming, not only for Michoacán, but for the whole country," said Luisa Maria Calderón in a radio interview a day after Sunday's vote.
“They threatened our candidates, our electoral workers... They seized the polls, installed barricades... and ordered people to vote” in favor of the PRI.
The PRI ruled Mexico for seven decades until it lost the presidency in 2000.
However, it is the stage of a return, and the victory in Michoacán is an important step in that effort.
The PRI is hoping to win the presidential election in July.
Vallejo seems to have surpassed Calderón, who had led the polls before the elections.
Calderón, a candidate from his brother’s conservative National Action Party, or PAN, refused to recognize Vallejo as the winner.
Silvano Aureoles, the leftist candidate for the Democratic Revolutionary Party, or PRD, who currently holds the post of governor, came third, a major defeat for the divided and unfortunate left before the 2012 presidential elections.
Aureoles also refused to recognize the preliminary results.
Vallejo, former mayor of the state capital Morelia, denied ties to drug trafficking and urged the other candidates to accept the results.
Michoacan has long been dominated by drug cartels specializing in marijuana, heroin and methamphetamines.
It is the native state of President Calderón, and he chose Michoacán to launch a military offensive aimed at traffickers in December 2006.
However, the violence has continued.
A PAN mayor was assassinated a week before the elections while campaigning for Luisa María Calderón, and numerous candidates abandoned local candidatures for fear.
Although for the PRI, however unpleasant the elections of Michoacán may seem, a victory will help to boost the party.
The man who is supposed to represent the PRI in the presidential election, Enrique Peña Nieto, speaking from Washington, congratulated Vallejo and said: "I think this victory should be very encouraging, in the face of next year."
The BAsD urges Asia to help save the eurozone
The Asian Development Bank (BAsD) has called on India and China to prepare to help rescue the eurozone from its sovereign debt crisis to avoid a long-term recession that would hinder the growth of Asian economies.
Rajat Nag, chief executive of the Asian Development Bank based in Manila, said the world’s two fastest-growing economies had to “do everything possible” to accelerate the economic bloc’s recovery either through the International Monetary Fund or directly through bilateral agreements.
He warned against BRIC [Brazil, Russia, India, China] countries that look at Europe's difficulties in a "impartial" way and said that Asian financial assistance along with European leadership and resources would help avoid a long-term crisis in the global economy.
“We are all together in this.”
"So anyone who can help Europe out of the crisis is helpful," he told the Financial Times in an interview at the World Economic Forum in Bombay.
“Asia can be protected to some extent, but it cannot be immune.”
“So if China and India can help, let it be by all means.”
The European monetary union has been severely undermined by a sovereign debt crisis in recent months.
In recent days, Italy’s debt costs have exploded dangerously and the prime ministers of Italy and Greece have resigned.
The current sovereign debt crisis in Europe has increased fears that it could push the world economy into recession and has generated calls for major emerging economies to join forces to help the eurozone find a solution.
Mr Nag predicted that any Asia’s support would be channeled through the IMF, but said bilateral assistance – such as the purchase of bonds from the EU’s bailout fund, the European Financial Stability Fund – offered greater negotiating power for Europe’s Asian partners.
India’s trade minister, Anand Sharma, said “India will do everything possible” to help the eurozone as its own economy was now suffering from falling exports and exhaustion of foreign capital incomes.
“No one wants the eurozone to remain unstable and turbulent,” he said.
“We have monumental challenges and we have to maintain a high level of growth.”
"It's not an option, it's an imperative, because where we find employment for tens of millions of our young men and women."
Others argue that developing economies like India have no responsibility to help wealthy Europeans when they face their own and profound economic problems.
Ashutosh Varshney, a professor at Brown University in the U.S., said it would be politically very difficult to sell aid to Europe for India’s one billion two hundred thousand people, of whom up to 800 million live with about $2 a day or less.
"At some point they will realize that the Greeks retire at the age of 50 and go on holiday to the beach and that's not going to go well," he said.
Lee Howell, managing director of the World Economic Forum, also wondered why India’s reserves should be used to keep the numerous and well-paid Greek public sector workers in jobs in poorly managed companies, and generating losses like the railways.
Mr Nag said the eurozone crisis threatens to have “significant chain effects” across Asia.
The Asian Development Bank’s forecast of 7.5 percent economic growth in Asia for 2011/12 is now facing “downward risks” due to the threat from Europe.
He said vulnerable emerging markets needed to make “contingency plans” to protect themselves from a crisis and significant capital outflows from their economies.
Pentagon warns of possible defense cuts
Defense Secretary Leon Panetta warned Congress on Monday that automatic budget cuts could undermine national security and provoke a chain financial reaction from the Pentagon corridors, to Afghanistan’s battlefields, to civilian assembly chains.
The Pentagon is already digesting $450 billion in cuts over the next decade, but now fears an additional 600 billion or more in cuts that could be imminent if Congress fails to reach an agreement on spending.
"The impact of these cuts would be devastating for the department," Panetta said in a letter to Senators John McCain, Republican for Arizona, and Lindsey Graham, Republican for South Carolina.
He said Congress’ failure to reach an agreement on the budget and its consequence, the so-called “seizure,” would result in 23 percent global cuts and a stop to many new projects.
“Such a large cut, applied in this indiscriminate way, would make most of our naval and construction projects impossible to execute – you can’t buy three-quarters of a ship or a building – and seriously damage other modernization efforts,” Panetta wrote to the senators.
“We would also be forced to dismiss many of our civilian officials involuntarily and, because the reduction would be imposed so quickly, it is almost certain that we would have to license civilians in order to meet the goal.”
“These changes would break the faith with those who maintain our army and seriously damage the good disposition.”
The cuts would eventually reach the combat troops, Panetta said.
"While wartime funding on overseas emergency operations accounts is not directly affected by the abduction, war efforts would be negatively affected by serious disruptions in base budgets," Panetta warned.
“Personnel hiring would be reduced, which would lead to delays in contracts and supervision of the contract that supports the war.”
"Working staff would be reduced, resulting in delays in payments to suppliers in time of war, and legal and political support would be disrupted."
The two senators had written to Panetta 10 days ago, asking for information about the possible impact of the automatic cuts in the Defense Department.
“The consequence of a kidnapping at the Defense Department would cause a rapid decline of the United States as the world’s leading military power.”
"We are firmly against this draconian action," the senators said in a joint statement on Monday afternoon when they published Panetta's letter.
“This is not a result we can live with, and it is not one we should impose on ourselves.”
“The abduction is a threat to the national security interests of the United States, and it should not be allowed to happen.”
Whether Panetta’s letter and recent warnings from senators will increase pressure for a budget commitment or intensify calls to exempt the Pentagon from cuts remains to be seen.
Panetta has been increasingly frank about possible cuts, even though he came to a job at the top of the Pentagon with years of budgeting experience at Congress and the White House and knowing he was facing difficult decisions.
At a press conference last week, the defense secretary painted a shady picture of what could be ahead – an army with a shell, but not a core.
“It is a ship without sailors.”
“It’s a brigade without bullets.”
“It’s an air wing without enough trained pilots.”
"It's a paper tiger, an army of barracks, buildings and bombs without enough trained soldiers to carry out the mission," Panetta said in his opening words at the Pentagon.
“It’s a force that suffers from low morality, poor preparation and is unable to keep up with potential opponents.”
“Indeed, it invites to aggression...”
In an appendix to her letters to McCain and Graham, Panetta outlines new details of how the cuts “generate significant operational risks: delay in response time to crises, conflicts and disasters; severely limit our ability to be deployed and engaged previously around the world; and pose an unacceptable risk in future combat operations.”
And Panetta said some of the biggest defense projects could face the hache, including those that are already being tested and some only in the early stages of planning.
The list includes the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, a new planned bomber, the new-generation ballistic submarine, the new coastal combat vessel and the new ground combat vehicle that the Army and Navy need to replace, the humvee.
Stopping the development and additional tests of the F35 could generate about $80 billion in savings over 10 years, but its supporters say it is the next vital step to improve and address potential threats from China and other rivals.
How to Detect a Lie
A look at the most recent titles shows us how serious and ubiquitous deception and lies are in everyday life.
Republican presidential candidate Herman Cain is busy exchanging sexual harassment accusations with several women; each accuses the other of lying.
Pennsylvania State University administrators have been accused of perjury for allegedly hiding reports that said a retired football coach was sexually assaulting children.
Last week, French President Nicolas Sarkozy was “picked” with an open microphone saying to US President Barack Obama that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is a liar.
Lies have destroyed careers and convulsed countries.
New York congressman and Internet exhibitionist Anthony Weiner made the ridicule with his denials quickly overthrown by the irrefutable evidence.
Former presidential candidate John Edwards has been charged with campaign funding violations related to the cover-up of an extramarital relationship.
And again, no one who lived it will ever forget the media circus unleashed by President Bill Clinton by lying during his second term about his sexual relationship with Monica Lewinsky.
Legends about traps in school and university exams are widespread.
There have been cases where teachers have given exam answers to students in order to be better seen in their performance assessments.
Mentors who should be teaching the opposite are sending the message that lying and deceiving are acceptable.
How much deception do we find?
In any day, studies show that they can lie to you anywhere from 10 to 200 times.
That’s for sure, many of those lies are godly lies.
Another study showed that strangers lied three times in the first 10 minutes of meeting.
Detecting lies, or “locating lies,” is an essential skill we should all acquire, for personal and professional reasons.
Far from being a table game similar to, for example, Charada, where the goal is to exclaim: “I have you,” deception detection is a branch of serious knowledge based on scientific data obtained during the last six decades at prestigious universities that have carried out in-depth research projects, especially in psychology and physiology.
One of the results of the research is that the old myths about lies have been overthrown.
The liars look in the eyes.
They don’t always tartamude, balbucean, rub, or disturb.
It cannot be concluded either that liars are difficult to detect or unmask.
A trained lie detector can come to the truth by learning about the structure of the statement, microfacial expressions, question formation, and times.
I spent several years surveying scientific discoveries about deception in the vast and always emerging body of knowledge, and it was clear that deception detection is a modern technique that is easy to learn and helps navigate our complex world – especially if your professional responsibilities include hiring, interviews, or negotiation management.
Good liars have the ability to read others well, making them feel comfortable, managing their own emotions, and intuitively feeling how others perceive them.
We know from research that extroverts lie more than introverts, that men say more "self-oriented lies", while women say more "other-oriented" lies -- usually to protect someone's feelings -- that married people lie less often to their partners than people who are not married (but the lies they usually say tend to be "enormous").
We also know that if you are perceived as a villain, others will feel less guilty of lying to you.
How do you know if someone is lying?
First, observe the subject’s usual behavior.
This is called “creating a base line.”
It helps to provide benchmarks for later measurement of changes.
Observe the subject’s posture, laughter and vocal characteristics.
It’s better to know if someone normally hits his foot all the time so as not to make unfair accusations when you see his feet kicking in the middle of the meeting.
Then look for misleading, verbal and non-verbal behavioral groups.
Consider these behavioral groups as alarm signs, not as evidence of deception.
People who cheat can freeze the upper part of the body by trying to remember their story, they can point their feet toward the door, bend toward an exit, change their posture significantly, or exhibit a “post-interview challenge” — that exaggerated breath of relief and change of posture once all the difficult questions have ended.
Often interrogators falsely suggest that the interview has ended just to seek that post-interview relief.
Also pay attention to the vocabulary of the subject.
Scott Peterson threw his leg to the bottom and used the time spent as he claimed his murdered wife was alive, launching a national search for her.
People who cheat can also use a distancing language: “I didn’t have sex with that woman... Mrs. Lewinsky” or repeat a difficult question entirely.
The most common verbal indicators are subtle.
Someone can use a lot of “restrictive language” when answering a difficult question: “Well... to say truth... as far as I can... to my understanding.”
This makes the answer a perception rather than a fact and is often a warning sign.
There is no magic formula to detect lies, but developing skills to discover deception is possible.
These skills will enhance anyone’s chances of avoiding being victimized by scam artists in their professional and personal lives.
The controversial pipeline plan deviated after the threat of US delay in its approval
Days after the Obama administration threatened to delay the approval of a planned pipeline from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico -- angering trade unions while calming environmentalists -- the company seeking to build the pipeline says it is willing to redirect the project to redirect it.
TransCanada said on Monday night it will move the planned pipeline out of the ecologically sensitive Sandhills area in Nebraska, and is confident the project will win approval.
The company announced the decision at a press conference in the Nebraska Capitol.
TransCanada manager Alex Pourbax says the company remains confident that the pipeline will be approved over time, although it is true that with a different route.
This comes after the State Department announced last week that it would delay the decision for a federal permit for the project until new potential routes are studied that avoid the Sandhills areas of Nebraska and the Ogallala aquifer, a vast supply of groundwater.
“This is a true path of progress,” Lee Terry, a Republican from Nebraska, told Fox News.
The new environmental review ordered by the State Department is likely to set aside any decision until 2013, after next year’s elections, although officials denied that the policy was involved in the decision.
Obama, in a written statement last week, described the decision as a request from the State Department, and expressed his full support.
The 1,700-kilometer pipeline would extend from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico.
It would carry 700,000 barrels per day from Alberta province to refineries in Texas.
To do this, it would need to cross six states.
It is hated by environmentalists, but loved by working groups, who have pledged an estimated 20,000 jobs linked to the pipeline.
But Nebraska lawmakers opposed to the plan are weighing legislation to force a removal from the Sandhills region and the Ogallala aquifer, the largest source of drinking water and irrigation.
The State Department’s current environmental impact study found that the project only posed limited adverse environmental impacts, but the energy industry source said the department’s general inspector has ordered an independent test of the review process, focusing on two issues.
One is if TransCanada-held lobby member Paul Elliot, who was Hillary Clinton's campaign adviser in 2008, represents a conflict of interest for the program.
The other is if a firm that was hired to direct the original studio was an inappropriate choice because it was linked to TransCanada.
Patti LaBelle sued for allegedly causing a child to vomit
A New York family claims that disco music diva Patti LaBelle behaved like a mad woman in the hallway of her Manhattan building, scaring her little daughter to the point that she vomited out of fear.
"Lady Marmalade" singer's diatribes scared 18-month-old Genevieve Monk so much that she suffered "personality changes, sleep disorders" and "increased her fear of strangers," her family at the Manhattan Supreme Court said.
It was November 10 last year when tramoyist Kevin Monk, his wife, Roseanna, a kindergarten teacher, and Genevieve were preparing to go on a family trip.
While Kevin Monk was picking up the car, Roseanna Monk went down to the Riverside Boulevard building hallway, with her luggage, taking Genevieve.
Roseanna Monk said she stopped near the door and put her daughter on the floor for a moment.
"Someone approached from behind and said, 'Do you know what your daughter is doing?' I said 'yes' and went to pick her up,' she said.
LaBelle warned the pregnant woman angry.
“She said in an aggressive tone, ‘I shouldn’t have left her daughter near the door,’” Roseanna Monk said.
I said, “I’m not interested in what you say or think.”
He got angry and started using bad words — the word C and the word J out loud...
I had a bottle of water and started throwing the water out of the bottle on me."
She said Genevieve became hysterical.
"I said to this woman, 'Look what you've done to my daughter,' said the girl's mother.
LaBelle waved over her mother -- who still held Genevieve -- and had to be contained by her surroundings and withdrawn to a car waiting for her, Roseanna Monk said.
The little girl was crying so loud that she vomited, she added.
Later, the family sent a note asking for an apology from LaBelle, but received no response.
LaBelle’s lawyer and representatives did not return the calls to comment on what happened.
The lawsuit seeks unspecified damages, but the family’s lawyer, Sam Davis, said it took the case for free and the family plans to donate all the money it gets to a support association for children with cancer.
“The purpose is to make Patti LaBelle responsible for her behavior,” Davis said.
“This kind of behavior is completely unacceptable, especially when it is addressed to a kindergarten teacher who carries an 18-month-old boy in her arms.”
Climate change has slowed the economy
During the first year of Mario López Valdez’s management, Sinaloa has increased unemployment and informality, lowered foreign investment and contracted the economy.
The 2011 is a year that will be remembered in the economic history of Sinaloa, it is the first year of Government of Mario López Valdez, self-known as the change, which generated great expectations regarding the advances in the economy, but given the climate adversity of the beginning of the year, there is no growth, but a deterioration in the main indicators of economic development is registered.
February’s low temperatures, in addition to causing millionaire losses for the agricultural sector, limited the chances of the state’s economy to grow, caused a contraction of overall economic activity of 3.6 percent in the first half of the year, justified mainly by the historic 31.16 percent drop in agriculture, which affected the dynamism of the other economic sectors.
According to the report of ice impact, issued by the Mexican Council for Sustainable Rural Development, 582,835 hectares were damaged, of which 78.03 percent suffered total damage and the remaining 21,07 percent had partial damage, the main crops damaged were those of vegetables, corn and garbage.
The fall in economic activity has generated, until November, a steady increase in unemployment in the state, according to the National Institute of Statistics and Geography the rate of state unemployment during the first three quarters of the year was observed an accelerated growth, since while from January to March 55 053 Sinaloans were unemployed, with a rate of 4.53 percent of the Economically Active Population, for the second quarter the rate went to be 5.28 percent, and between July and September the average continued to increase to 6.19 percent, a rate that in number of people throws more than 74 thousand Sinaloans unemployed, an increase with respect to the first semester of 18 969 individuals.
Less liquidity
Unemployment in Sinaloa during the year is multifactorial, for economist Gerardo López Cervantes, director of the Faculty of Economic and Social Sciences of the UAS, the growth of unemployment can be explained indirectly, depending on the actions that have been carried out from public policy.
"What is being seen is a growth in unemployment that has to do with several factors, including the loss of liquidity in the market due to a restriction of resources by the legislation that was passed in Congress to combat money laundering, and for people who grab dollars illegally it is not easy for them to work, invest and use them in something," he said.
Migration arrested
López Cervantes noted that there is also a demographic factor in the increase in unemployment.
"The number of people who leave the state in search of work abroad, in the United States has been restricted, first by the difficulties to enter, and secondly because entering already have also many difficulties to find work, that people are staying and is demanding sources of work here in the state, which makes unemployment rise," he said.
Informality
The analysis of the Sinaloan labour market is aggravated by considering the high level of informality that predominates among the working conditions, according to the INEGI, 60.38 percent of the occupied population in the state works without being quoted as a worker before any social security institution.
Together with unemployment and informality, another of the state’s labor losses are low wages, the entity has the lowest remuneration in the country, according to the records of the Mexican Institute of Social Security and the Secretariat of Labor and Social Security.
The average monthly income of the Sinaloan workers was, until September, 5,352 pesos, well below the national average, located at 7,375 pesos.
Contraction of IED
Together with the decline in economic activity and the increase in unemployment, during 2011 the largest decrease in Foreign Direct Investment of the last 10 years is recorded, according to the Secretariat of Economy from January to June of the state IED totaled $630 thousand 697 which represents a drop of 87.74 percent from the $5 million 143 thousand 312 registered during the same period of the previous year.
For its part, the State Government’s Secretariat for Economic Development accounts for a total investment of 17,280 million pesos in the year, mainly from companies in the tertiary sector.
The Debt
In the face of the scenario of economic contraction, the government of the state requested in July to the state congress the approval of a credit for 3 billion pesos, the same that would be destined the investment in infrastructure projects in the 18 municipalities, with the purpose of reactivating the economy, the approval of the local congress was for a sum of 2,600 million pesos, and until November have not observed the benefits of indebtedness in any sector of the state economy.
Reactions
For representatives of the business sector, the first year of the Government of Mario López Valdés shows a lack of management capacity of the Government.
Miguel Loredo López, president of the National Chamber of Transformation Industry, expressed that during 2011 it lacked the harmonization of wills of the various sectors, including the state government itself.
"The performance of the economy in Sinaloa during this year has been really very poor, we have to work intensively to recover the ground we lost this year, in 2012 we have to redouble efforts, it failed to align the effort of all and above all the good march already synchronized of this new government team, we hope that next year will be much better," he said.
Economic slowdown
Loredo López stated that events such as the early frosts of the year stopped the state economy and restricted its performance and growth.
“The low economic flow is the product of several events, including the frosts, one of the main effects has been a slow economy that does not turn around fast enough to generate an economic dynamism that allows to have an acceptable level of flow in processes, products and services and therefore, at the end of the year we are closing well below the expectations we had,” he said.
Redefining the vocation
For Teodoro Salazar Uriarte, president of the Confederation of Employers of the Mexican Republic in Sinaloa, he stated that it is necessary to incite the state towards productive activities of greater dynamism.
"In general terms we have observed that it has been working, we believe that it is necessary to develop a long-term program in which the vocation and economic direction of the state is redefined, because it is important that all the potential of the material and human resource that Sinaloa has is detonated," he said.
I work to do
The president of the Coparmex highlighted the importance of establishing a vision of the future that better encompasses the Government’s efforts.
“In general terms I would say that the Government has been striving to give good results in different subjects, in terms of economic development there are some advances but it is important that a long-term program is developed,” he said.
He noted that the current administration has shown advances in its way of conducting public policy.
“There are elements that allow to say that the Government is being more inclusive, I can say that there is work done and I think the Government is aware that there is work to be done,” he said.
He was convicted of 8 kg of marijuana.
A neighbor of Navolato was sentenced to five years in prison and 100 days in fine for possession of eight kilos of marijuana.
The Prosecutor General’s Office of the Republic that the drug agent sentenced is Omar Alexis Valenzuela Sandoval, for the crime against health, in his variant of possession of marijuana for trade purposes.
According to AP/SIN/CLN/687/2010/M-I, Valenzuela Sandoval was detained by elements of the Mexican Army, on June 7, 2010, in an operative of surveillance on Calle Cipriano Valdez, in front of poste 80, in the town of El Castillo, Navolato.
The narcoman circulated in a white pick-up truck, where he carried a black bag in the vehicle box and a small backpack in the copilot seat, where the military found eight kilograms of 23 grams of marijuana.
For such reasons, the insured remains at the disposal of the Second District Judge and the sentenced remains internally in the Centre for the Execution of the Legal Consequences of the Crime.
Contributions to works
The social works envisaged in programs such as Habitat, Public Space Rescue and 3x1 for migrants are at risk of not being completed or having serious delays due to lack of economic resources, Miguel Ángel López Miranda said.
The director of municipal Social Development indicated that although so far the works programmes have advanced, they are at risk by not having met the Government of the State with the contributions that correspond to it which add a resource greater than 11 million pesos in the three programs.
He pointed out that in total the investment in these three programs is almost 50 million pesos, of which the State corresponds to 25 percent and that until now only the Federation and the Municipality have contributed resources for the works, so the possible delay in the conclusion of these is valid.
"It's almost 12 million what it's up to them to provide and despite the fact that the year is about to end, they have not given us a fifth, when since July they had to give us a part," he said, "we have started the works and are very advanced, but we need the money."
He mentioned that last year, in the administration of Jesús Aguilar Padilla, the State did not comply with the contributions that corresponded to them, so at the beginning of the administration the Municipality had to request a credit to cover the more than 7 million that did not provide at that time the state administration.
"It happened to us in the previous sexenny because the State did not have the economic capacity to participate and the programs continued to walk, and this year we to be able to access these programs we had to get the resources to cover what the State left pending," he said.
Despite the commitment of the state authorities to comply with the delivery of these resources, he commented that the request has been made to the Secretary of Administration and Finance, Armando Villarreal, to hasten the management so that the percentages that correspond to them arrive as soon as possible.
"It's almost 12 million that it's up to them to provide and even though the year is about to end, they haven't given us a fifth."
Previous articleCorte validates “analogous shutdown” in Mexico in 2015
The replacement of analog signals by digital signals is one of the most important changes the world has suffered in recent years.
The Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation (SCJN) has dismissed the constitutional controversies that the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies have raised against the presidential decree that advances the so-called "analogous shutdown" from 2021 to 2015, by not meeting the eight necessary votes to invalidate it.
A minority of four ministers, including the President of the Court, Juan Silva Meza, considered that President Felipe Calderón did not exceed his powers in issuing the decree detailing the actions to be taken to concrete the transition to terrestrial digital television.
With that result, the constitutional controversy promoted by the Senate of the Republic, was dismissed for not reaching the qualified majority of eight votes for the Court to pronounce on the constitutionality or unconstitutionality of the decree, and this remains in force.
The draft sentence, drafted by Minister Olga Sánchez Cordero, proposed to declare the decree unconstitutional, because the regulation of radio and television matters is a faculty reserved by law to the Federal Telecommunications Commission (Cofetel), in violation of the principles of hierarchical subordination and reservation of law.
In favor of the project voted only Zaldívar, Jorge Mario Pardo, Margarita Luna and Sánchez Cordero himself.
With this argument, both the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies promoted two constitutional controversies to challenge the decree, and by admitting the demands, Minister Sánchez Cordero suspended the application of the decree and all the actions in it for the digital transition.
The plenary of ministers also decided to dismiss the demand put forward by the Chamber of Deputies, without entering the discussion of the project, also in charge of Minister Sánchez Cordero.
In his speech, the prime minister said he did not agree with the arguments of the draft, in the sense that the federal executive cannot structure through general rules the measures for the public administration to prepare.
"I do not consider that if I did, it would affect the autonomy of the regulatory body," and he recalled that the planning of public policies in strategic areas such as the telecommunications sector corresponds to the federal executive, who has a constitutional mandate, the rectorate of the State.
The replacement of analog signals by digital signals is one of the most important changes the world has undergone in recent years, and translates into a better utilization of the radio spectrum, a better quality of the signal and more channels.
To delay the change, he said, would be to postpone the benefits of digitalization, which implies a decision of public interest, which does not have only a technical dimension, “because it covers economic, social, political and national security issues.”
These issues, he said, “exigent the operation of the entire established system, in accordance with the principle of economic rectorate of the State, encompassing a group of attributions that the Constitution leads to the faculty of the State Executive.”
He recalled that a large number of countries around the world have already completed the digital transition, and have done so through the Executive, despite having highly specialized technical bodies.
It cannot be concluded that the Executive, by issuing the contested decree, invades in some form the sphere of competence of the Congress, since the observance of the laws issued by the Legislative is being provided in the administrative sphere, he said.
Analysis of the possibility of a "vote by vote" count in Michoacán
According to the data cast by the PREP the difference between first and second place in the election of governor is only 27 percent, even without counting the votes corresponding to 879 of the 6,74 total acts.
The possibility of counting "vote by vote" is a reality as regards this year's electoral process in Michoacán, where according to the data thrown by the Program of Preliminary Electoral Results (PREP) the difference between first and second place of the election of governor is only 27 percent, even without counting the votes corresponding to 879 of the 6 thousand 74 total acts.
In this regard, the president of the General Council of the Electoral Institute of Michoacán (IEM), María de los Ángeles Llanderal Zaragoza, recalled that a few days ago, just last November 9, the electoral body approved a series of guidelines in order to harmonize local rules with the federal reform in electoral matters.
As will be remembered, Michoacán did not homologate its Political Constitution nor its Electoral Code of the State or its Law of Electoral Justice, since the Congress of the State approved the reforms shortly before concluding the legal deadline so that they could enter into force in the present electoral process and governor Leonel Godoy Rangel omitted its publication in the time limits provided in the Law of the Official State Journal, with the argument that he had some objections.
On November 9, the Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation (SCJN) resolved the constitutional controversy promoted by the local Legislative Power and qualified as "invalid and illegal" the state president's vote on constitutional reforms, since he has no right to "sanction or veto them".
Interviewed around the possibility of "vote by vote", María de los Ángeles Llanderal explained that thanks to the approval of the corresponding guidelines by the IEM General Council it will be possible to carry out partial and total voting counts by the local electoral body.
In this way, the partial counting of votes, of one or more electoral packages, may be given in the event that: the results of the acts do not coincide; the acts of scrutiny and calculation do not exist in the case of the case or do not operate in the power of the president of the same; or when there are errors or obvious alterations of the acts.
In addition, the total counting of the votes received in all the boxes of the election may be made when there is an indication that the difference between the presumed winner of the election in question and the one who has obtained the second place in the vote is equal to or less than a percentage point; provided that at the beginning of the session there is an express request from the representative of the party and/or coalition that applied for the second of the indicated candidates.
The total counting of votes may also be carried out if, at the end of the ordinary counting, it is established that the difference between the allegedly winning candidate and the second-placed candidate is equal to or less than a percentage point, provided that there is an express request from the representative of the political party whose candidate was second-placed, in which case electoral packages that have been the subject of partial counting shall be excluded.
It should be mentioned that in this situation is the election of Morelia, where according to the PREP the difference between the first and second place is only 0.16 percent, although without accounting for the votes of 129 of the 923 total acts.
His last will
His ashes will be scattered in the Zapalinamé mountain range, the family confirms.
The remains of the pilot Felipe Bacio Cortés arrived in Saltillo, his hometown, on Sunday night, during Monday were held recognitions and a requiem mass.
According to his relatives, the lieutenant colonel’s last wish was that his ashes were scattered in the Zapalinamé mountain range.
After receiving a tribute on the side of the other people who died in the accident, the Bacio Cortés family returned to the capital of Coahuila on board a Mexican Air Force aircraft, the closest people attended the ceremony at Campo Marte.
At twelve o’clock at noon, the ashes of Lieutenant Colonel arrived at the sailing chapel on the Nazario Ortiz Garza boulevard, where family and friends arrived.
At 5:30 p.m. he was awarded a recognition at the Saltillo Institute of Technology organized by his former colleagues from the technological bachelor's and American football team, of which Felipe Bacio was part during his bachelor's preparation.
"His will was to return to Saltillo and that his ashes were scattered in the Zapalinamé mountain range, he always expressed it to his family and friends," said the pilot's sister, Sandra Bacio Cortés.
For her, the lieutenant colonel had fulfilled all his dreams, considers that he was in the fullness of his life, "he was a successful man, extraordinary as a father, as a son, a loving brother and on the sidelines of his family."
Felipe Bacio Cortés left the city of Saltillo very young to enter the Air College in Zapopán, Jalisco.
Some did not believe it because they said he was even dizzying in the truck; however, he always sought to fulfill his dream of becoming a pilot.
His nephew Jorge Alberto Dávila Bacio remembers him as a very good person, "only was in Saltillo the whole family we wanted to greet him, like the occasion when he brought Martha Sahagún to Saltillo."
The young man recalls that even when he was seven he traveled to Zapopán for his family’s graduation, so he knows that his uncle died doing what he liked most in life: flying an aircraft.
Give him the last goodbye
With honors was dismissed Lieutenant Colonel of the Mexican Air Force, Felipe Bacio Cortés, in tribute to the governor Jorge Torres López, who gave him the people and Government of the State, the Mexican Army, through the Sixth Military Zone, the Mexican Air Force itself, directors and students of the Saltillo Technological Institute, where he studied in 1985 and stood out both in the study and in the sport.

Three abandoned bodies found in Cadereyta NL
Hours before the discovery, the military authority presented to the media eleven people who were detained in the same municipality for crimes related to organized crime.
Three men were found killed by bullets in different parts of the body and with the grace shot, in an abandoned estate of the municipality of Cadereyta Jiménez, Nuevo León.
The finding occurred on the 1.5 km of the road from Cadereyta to Santiago, at the height of the community known as El Castillo.
Several people who passed by the place observed that in the fifth, whose barda is beige with coffee, the door was opened in pair.
Looking inside, about three meters away, they found the bodies of three people, so they immediately alerted the corresponding authorities.
One of the individuals was dressed in yellow beach with dark mixed pants, without shoes; next to him was another with white striped beach.
A little over a meter away was the body of another individual with a red shirt and a blue shirt.
All three were mouth-down.
According to the data obtained on the spot, the three people would have been killed elsewhere, as no helmets were found on the site.
In the bark of the fifth are appreciated legends that go directed from one group of organized crime to another, in addition to several bullet holes in the same and the gate.
11 arrested in the area
The Secretariat of National Defense presented 11 people, including a minor, who were part of a criminal group that operated mainly in the municipality of Cadereyta and who are related to kidnappings, homicides, “halcone” and clandestine inhumations.
According to the information given to the public, in a first fact on November 11 in the Los Alveros colony eight people were detained and one man who remained deprived of his liberty was rescued.
They were insured three properties and a cell phone; they claimed to be members of the criminal group called "The Zetas".
In another incident on November 12 at 06:00, military personnel conducted a surveillance tour in the village of Rancho Viejo, in Cadereyta, detecting a car without plates and with two subjects on board.
When they checked and inspected, the military found a long gun, a charger and 18 cartridges.
Later and after these statements, on November 13, at 14:00, one of his accomplices in the La Frauda exile was stopped, who, seeing the military, attempted to flee.
They are attributed to clandestine inhumations in the municipalities of General Terán, China and Cadereyta.
The new Italian government will be formed on Wednesday.
The appointed prime minister, Mario Monti, will meet tomorrow with the president of Italy to present the new government that will face a crisis that has placed that country on the brink of economic disaster.
Italy's appointed prime minister, Mario Monti, will meet with the president of Italy on Wednesday to present the new government that will face a crisis that has put Italy on the brink of economic disaster and has put the entire eurozone at risk.
A statement from the presidential palace said Monti, who was appointed on Sunday, will meet with President Giorgio Napolitano on Wednesday to confirm that he can form a government.
He is expected to present a cabinet composed mostly of technocrats, although it is unclear when the new executive will take over.
Monti said he would present to the president the outcome of his talks with political parties in his attempt to form a government.
"I want to confirm my absolute confidence in our country's ability to overcome this difficult phase," the former European Commissioner told reporters.
Monti did not explicitly say he could form a government but the tone of his comments indicated that the obstacles have been overcome.
The “framework is now well delineated,” he added.
Monti has completed the process of forming a government in less than three days, much less than usual, as Italy fights a political and financial crisis that has pushed its debt costs to unsustainable levels.
The new administration led by former European Commissioner Monti must approve a tough austerity package demanded by European leaders to regain the beaten confidence in Italy.
Underlining pressure on Monti to rush, market instability placed Italian bond yields at 10 years above 7 percent, the level at which Greece and Ireland were forced to be rescued.
Emma Marcegaglia, the leader of Italian employer Confindustria, told the press after meeting with Monti: "We said we would support this government a lot."
We believe this government is the last chance for Italy to get out of this emergency.
Monti’s chances of success were greatly boosted by the support of Silvio Berlusconi’s PDL party, whom the crisis forced to resign on Saturday.
"We believe that Professor Monti's efforts are meant to have a good result," Angelino Alfano, secretary of the center-right party, told the press.
The support of the PDL, Italy’s largest party, is significant because so far many of its members had opposed the technocratic-majority government that is forming Monti.
Parliamentary support
Monti’s new government must have strong parliamentary support to implement what will likely be unpopular austerity reforms.
Any blockage or delay in their efforts could provoke a new and devastating attack on the financial markets.
The Italian Association of Foreign Banks added to pressure by warning that a Monti failure would be a disaster.
Monti began on Monday his consultations with political parties, trade unions and business groups, as well as with youth and women's organizations.
He will end his round of meetings on Tuesday night.
Monti was appointed on Sunday by Napolitano, who has enabled an extremely rapid transition in response to the crisis.
After a short breath at the end of last week, when it became clear that Berlusconi would resign, Italian debt costs have now returned to critical levels amid uncertainty about whether the new prime minister will succeed.
Saving Italy, with a public debt of 1.8 trillion euros, would be too much for the current financial defenses of the eurozone.
Monti has said his government should last until the upcoming elections, scheduled for 2013, despite widespread predictions that politicians will only give him time to implement reforms before advancing the elections.
Monti has said he would like to include politicians in his cabinet, but the big parties insist that he must be formed only by technicians, an indication of his concerns over a process forced by financial pressure.
Political sources have pointed out that mutual distrust and disagreements between the parties are complicating the attempt to include political figures.
The Spaniards are higher than the Tics.
Of the 22 football players called from Spain, ten overtaken the 50 international games.
On the Costa Rica side, only one of the 22 convened reached the 50 matches.
A major contrast to Costa Rica, if you compare the 22 convened by both countries for today’s friendly, at 3:05 p.m., at the San Jose National Stadium.
While the world and European champions, number one in the FIFA monthly ranking, account for a broad record of class A inter-elections games, the Tricolor only owns defender Michael Umaña as the only one to have the 50 international matches.
This figure was reached on Friday in the match against Panama (0-2), at Rommel Fernández.
Spanish footballers who play in the Premier League and in powerful clubs in the Premier League of England, maintain yearly intense activity in domestic league and cup championships, and high-level shocks in European cups such as the Champions League.
To the above is added the experience with the Spanish Fury in complicated eliminations of the Euro Cup and the World Cup.
Tic footballers, on the contrary, have a limited international flight in a zone, such as the Concacaf, which is considered the lowest level within FIFA.
We see that the highest record of the Spanish national team is of archer Íker Casillas, who on Saturday before England (fall 0-1 in London) equaled the record of exporter Andoni Zubizarreta, with 126 international meetings.
Casillas will play today against the Tricolor and will set a new record for Spain of 127 internationalities.
Xavi Hernández, the Brain Volant of Barcelona, has 106.
Casillas and Xavi, even, were recognized the previous week by UEFA alongside the other centenarians of the Iberian team, Zubizarreta with 126 and the ariete of the Schalke, Raúl González, with 102.
Almost close to the centenary figure is Carles Puyol, with 97 games.
Followed by Xabi Alonso, with 91; Fernando Torres, with 90; David Villa and Sergio Ramos, both with 81; Andrés Iniesta, with 62; Cesc Fábregas, with 61; and David Silva, with 53.
On the tick side, and close to Michael Umaña, are the left side Júnior Díaz, with 48 presences and artillery Bryan Ruiz, with 45.
After that, only five surpassed the 30 matches: Keilor Navas with 31, Randall Azofeifa with 32, Michael Barrantes with 31, Carlos Hernández with 36 and José Luis López with 35.
The least .
With more than 30 performances in Spain, Gerard Piqué (37), Sergio Busquets (36), Santiago Santi Cazorla (32), Álvaro Arbeloa (31) and Raúl Albiol (31).
From the national side, with less than 30 presences, appear Roy Miller with 26, Winston Parks with 26, Gabriel Badilla with 25 and Roy Myrie with 23.
The rest are not approaching 20.
While Nacho Moreal only has four games and Jordi Alba two, in Costa Rica Víctor Bolívar has only one and Ólman Vargas and Edder Nelson still do not debut.
Spain’s historic goalkeeper is David Villa, with 50 dianas, followed by Fernando Torres with 27.
By Costa Rica, Bryan Ruiz is the one with nine, two more than Carlos Hernández and three more than Roy Myrie and Parks.
Quinteto included the country in its two-decade celebration tour
Going to Costa Rica is a dream made reality.
In an exclusive interview with Viva, Pearl Jam bassist Jeff Ament said the band is ready to give one of their best concerts next Sunday at the National Stadium.
They have been waiting for more than 20 years, but the band assures that for them it will also become a reality the dream of playing in the country.
This was stated by bassist and founding member Jeff Ament, who spoke exclusively with Viva, from Brazil, last week.
The group is on the South American wing of their two-decade-long celebration tour and on Sunday 20 will make their only stage in Central America.
That day they will be performing at the National Stadium, from 7:30 p.m., alongside the angelina band The X and the nationalists of Las Robertas.
This is an excerpt from the conversation, whose full transcription is on The Nation on the Internet.
For its Costa Rican fans, it is a dream made reality that Pearl Jam is going to play in Costa Rica, are they aware of what their fans are experiencing?
Going to Costa Rica is a dream made reality for us too.
This is just our second time in South and Central America and so far it has been great.
I’ve only been to Costa Rica once and on vacation; it’s such a beautiful country and I think we’ll be able to stay a few days there.
So we’re excited to bring our music there.
I ask because there is a kind of devotion to the band, the fans live with intensity the days before.
What do you say to your most fervent followers?
Thank you for staying by our side through all these years.
It took us almost 21 years to get to Costa Rica; thank you for waiting so long and we regret that it took us so long to get there.
Some people even already refer to his concert as the biggest show of the year.
Does that add a bit of pressure to your visit?
Some of the biggest shows we’ve played over the last 21 years have happened over the last couple of weeks.
We played a couple of giant shows in Sao Paulo and we hope that has put us in shape for this concert in Costa Rica.
We really look forward to playing there.
We love that country, we love surfing and the jungle; for both, Costa Rica is among the best in the world.
How did they discover Costa Rica and its surfing waves?
We have many friends who are surfers and I have a great friend who lives in Tamarindo and the waves there are incredible.
My friends always went surfing to Costa Rica and Nicaragua, along with Mexico, are great places to surf; so was how we found out, through people who love surfing.
Upon seeing the tour, they have come delivering huge shows with many songs.
What have they planned for their presentation in Costa Rica?
As we’ve never touched there before, then we have no restrictions on what we can do.
We will try to give the best show possible with a good variety of songs; we will try to play a couple of songs from each album and give our fans a good and diverse repertoire.
You never repeat the repertoire.
What is this due to?
I think it’s partly because we have nine albums and we can play more than 120 songs and each likes different songs, so it’s hard to choose which songs to play every night.
When we have two or three songs in the repertoire that we have been not playing for a while, that keeps us focused and also keeps us surprised because it reminds us of the reasons why we liked those songs and that we may have forgotten.
That makes the show more interesting for us and, therefore, I think it also makes it more interesting for people.
With this tour, they are celebrating 20 years of trajectory.
Looking back, is it hard to believe what you’ve achieved?
Yes absolutely .
First, I think none of us imagined that we would be in a great rock band and having done so for over 20 years makes it look like a dream.
We continue to count our blessings and we are very excited that we can continue to make music together.
We all love and love to make music.
We are lucky to go to places in the world where we have always wanted to go.
Things could not be better for us.
What did it mean to you to have been a fundamental part of the rise of the grunge?
It has always been an honour to be part of this big band.
We are very friends with the people of Soundgarden, Mudhoney and Alice in Chains.
It’s surprising when a move arises from a group of friends and it’s something uncommon.
From time to time, a band from a city arises, but it is much more strange when five or ten bands leave the same city at the same time.
We are proud and honored to be part of the Seattle group.
We still play with some of them from time to time.
Last year, we were at a festival with Alice in Chains and we were in Canada with Mudhoney, we saw Soundgarden on their tour, so we’re lucky to be friends with them all still and it’s an honor to be part of that Seattle sound that came up.
It’s also very strange that a band like yours stays together and with the same members for so long.
Yes, four of us have been together for 21 years and Matt (Cameron) joined us 13 years ago, which, by itself, is much longer than many bands last.
First, I think we are all lucky to be still alive and secondly, we all care about others.
We are all very close friends and, thanks to that, musical avenues have also opened up that give each one the freedom to experience.
We trust each other with each other’s music and it couldn’t be better.
Your relationship with the word fame has not been easy; however, thanks to your success, you have been able to do whatever you want.
How do you find a balance?
As we have grown, it has been easier to find a balance.
We make sure you’re not too touring because it’s easy to fall into that game of the big crowds and the people who love your music.
As long as one remembers that people are there for music, that reminds you that you have to respect the music and what brought it, without becoming acclaimed for being famous and being a rock star, something that none of us really interests.
What do you remember about Mother Love Bone?
I think we wrote very good songs and at first it was something great.
We were a band for almost three years and never released a record until after Andy (Andrew Woods) died.
There was a lot of frustration because it lasted so long and the most important thing is that we are still very friends with Bruce (Fairweather) and Greg (Gilmore), who started in the band with us and when I hear a song or see a photo I think of the incredible person Andy was and how he made me laugh, it was always a pleasure to go to work, laugh, talk about music and football and much more.
He was a surprising human being and we wondered.
The national band Las Robertas will be in charge of opening the show in Costa Rica.
Is it true that you know her work, especially Eddie Vedder, and that is why you chose her for the opening?
Yes, the production sent us videos with various proposals and that was the band we liked the most, so we are eager to see what Las Robertas can offer live and should be very entertaining.
Why do they always change the letter of Yellow Ledbetter live?
That’s a question for Ed (Eddie Vedder), so I don’t know.
He sings it and I think he does it with the first thing he thinks of.
As a bassist, what are your influences?
They are so many.
Among the first to come to mind are Geezer Butler, John Entwistle, C. J. Ramone, John Doe, Paul McCartney, Chuck Dukowski...
There are so many that I could talk all afternoon about the bassists I love.
How has Pearl Jam managed to keep grunge relevant even though it is no longer a fashion?
I think we all always feel a little disconnected from the word grunge.
When I think of it, it reminds me of the bands I mentioned before, like Mudhoney, Soundgarden, Nirvana and all those that came up at the same time, and, if there’s relevance now, I think it’s something wonderful because it’s music worth listening to and bands like Mudhoney are now making better music than ever.
At first, his music had a darker content and now it has become more positive.
What is this change due to?
It’s interesting because I think there’s a couple of songs on the new album that may seem more lightweight, but there’s also songs, like The End or Just Breathe that qualify as very dark songs although they can sound a bit positive.
With both, when Ed touched them to me, I cried when I heard them and they are deeply dark songs.
I think that when you grow up and there’s some trauma in your life and a family member or a friend is lost, those things start to influence your art and your music and those two songs undoubtedly represent that for me.
Also, I think you can be a happy person and still be able to make dark music.

Fujimori returns for medical examination
Former President Alberto Fujimori was admitted to a public hospital on Tuesday to be evaluated for the loss of muscle strength he has in his legs, his head doctor said.
Fujimori, 72, who has been sentenced to 25 years in prison for violations of human rights committed during his reign (1990-2000), suffers from several illnesses, including a cancer in the tongue for which he has been operated four times and which remains under control.
Congressman Alejandro Aguinaga, who is his personal doctor, told TV Channel N that Fujimori will be evaluated for three days at the National Institute of Neoplastic Diseases to determine the reason for the pain and the loss of strength of his lower limbs.
Aguinaga commented that in his opinion Fujimori would be a candidate to obtain the benefit of the indulgence for humanitarian reasons, however, said he did not want it because he knows he is innocent.
He has been operated four times of cancer to the tongue, has a weight loss of 18 kilograms to which other pathologies have been joined such as severe erosive gastritis, pancreatic cyst, kidney stones, arterial hypertension and circulatory problems in the legs, the doctor said.
Fujimori has been detained since September 2007 in the National Directorate of Special Operations of the police.
In April 2009 he was sentenced to 25 years in prison for the killing of 25 people at the hands of a military annihilation squadron that operated clandestinely in the early years of his government.
Mujica travels to Mexico to strengthen political ties
An official committee, headed by Uruguayan President José Mujica and composed of several ministers and businessmen, will begin a visit to Mexico on Tuesday in order to expand trade between the two nations and address political issues in the region.
Mujica will meet next Wednesday with her Mexican partner, Felipe Calderón, the highest point of an extensive agenda of meetings with political, commercial authorities and a meeting with the community of Uruguayans resident in Mexico, according to the agenda spread by the Uruguayan Presidency.
The meeting between the two presidents, in the city of Guadalajara, will be "appropriate for the exchange of information in everything that is political affairs between the two nations", according to the South American Presidency on its website.
According to local media, Mujica would seek to get Calderón to support Uruguay in the incident with France arising when the French president, Nicolas Sarkozy, included the South American country on a list of tax havens, at the G20 meeting in the French city of Cannes.
In his speech, Sarkozy threatened to exclude from the international community those countries that continue to be tax havens, a statement that provoked Uruguay's rejection and the call to consult its ambassador in the European country.
Mexico has chaired the G20, a group of the most powerful emerging and developed countries in the world, and has been in force with the South American country, since January this year, an agreement to exchange tax information in order to avoid double taxation.
The Uruguayan government has attempted in recent years to accelerate the creation of tax exchange agreements in order to leave the “grey list” of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), which consists of countries that have not implemented all international standards of tax cooperation.
On the trade level, Mexico and Uruguay have been in force since 2004 a Free Trade Agreement (FTA) that has increased the exchange of goods between both nations.
The bigotdo fontanero passes all three dimensions with "Super Mario 3D Land"
Super Mario has fought, tirelessly, over the course of 25 years to save Princess Peach from the clutches of the evil Bowser, but never before had done so in three dimensions: in "Super Mario 3D Land" will fight for the love of the girl in stereoscopic technology.
The title, which arrives this month in stores around the world, has been designed from the outset to take advantage of the features of the Nintendo 3DS portable console, which allows you to play in three dimensions without the need to use glasses.
"Mario is the character who has to say how the stereoscopy without glasses should work," said Nintendo's Spanish press secretary Omar Álvarez during the game's presentation in Madrid.
Álvarez indicated that "Super Mario 3D Land" is "the first Nintendo video game originally thought for that support", since so far hits such as "Star Fox 64 3D" or "Zelda: Ocarine of time 3D" were adaptations of existing titles.
The Nintendo spokesman has argued that, despite being in 3D, "Super Mario 3D Land" is an "accessible" video game that allows you to enjoy a quick and fluid gameplay.
Álvarez has claimed that "Super Mario 3D Land" contains two games in one: the first part is "simple" to fit the less skilled users.
Once overcome, the most experienced will be able to give a "second round" to the levels of play, which this time present greater difficulty.
In addition, users will be able to choose in real time between an “aggressive D” or one that only affects the depth of the action, but it will be necessary to play in three dimensions to be able to overcome the different challenges and “not succumb to optical illusions”.
This incursion of Super Mario in the three dimensions also implies the return of the character to a portable console, a fact that has not been produced since 2005.
In this video game, Nintendo cheats the fans of the saga and repeats the formula of the success of previous deliveries, consisting that the bigote fontanero will have to go through dangerous mined platforms with the aim of releasing the princess Peach.
Although the player will find innovations in the movements, environments, costumes and enemies and also a Luigi "playable".
Colom approves Portillo's extradition to the United States
President Álvaro Colom announced on Tuesday that he ordered the extradition of former governor Alfonso Portillo to be held accountable in the United States for the conspiracy to launder $70 million.
Thus ends the process for Guatemala to respond to the request of the northern country that claimed Portillo to judge him there.
In a press conference, Colom said his decision obeyed the independence of judicial and executive powers, taking into account that a court ruling had already ordered extradition.
He stressed that during his tenure he "did not put his hands" in judicial resolutions and handed down all the extraditions he had known.
In addition to Portillo, Sergio Ruano Marroquín, for murder and serious injuries, and Edgar Estrada Morales and Víctor Estrada Paredes, both for drug trafficking, will be extradited.
Colom’s decision is an executive procedure after all the judicial and constitutional instances were exhausted to prosecute the former president from 2000 to 2004.
According to resolutions of the Fifth Criminal Court and the Constitutional Court (CC), Portillo must be extradited once he has solved his legal situation in Guatemala and his human rights are guaranteed.
Portillo was acquitted for the disbursement of Q120 million in the Defense Ministry when he was president, which was the process that preceded the extradition, but the Public Ministry appealed and reactivated the case.
Trinijove has helped 6,000 young people at risk
The entity was born to prevent the fall in the marginalization of youth without training
The balance of the first 25 years of life of the Trinijove social support entity is important: 6,000 young people at risk of exclusion have received help to overcome a difficult situation throughout this quarter-century.
This adds to the hundred long jobs currently achieved for this social group.
The anniversary served yesterday to make a balance in an event held in the old factory complex of Fabra i Coats to which more than 300 people attended.
Trinijove was born in the neighborhood of Trinitat Vella in 1986 with the aim of helping young people with little training, without work, with problems of dogradiction or in a situation of falling into the marginality.
Yesterday’s celebration in Sant Andreu concentrated a large number of managers of entities and institutions who have been collaborating with the association for these 25 years.
The varied political representation, in full electoral time, showed the unitary character of Trinijove’s work.
Along with the President of the Generalitat, Artur Mas, and his predecessor Jordi Pujol, attended the event the exconseller of Socialist Education, Ernest Maragall, and the extended mayor and current ecosocialist council Ricard Gomà.
Also attended to the grand room of the Fabra i Coats the current conseller of Social and Family welfare, Josep Lluís Cleries, and the general director of the social work of La Caixa, Jaume Lanaspa.
Mas stated that Trinijove was born in a very difficult time and that the current is also, but added that the work done so far "is a good base".
The president set Trinijove as an example for knowing how to fight against bad circumstances and for giving hope to people with difficulties.
“The crisis is not something new for the entity and for the work it does,” he said.
Evacuation of an occupied estate where macro festivals were held
The invaders had seized 11 of the 13 floors of the building, in Balmes, 51
The 12 occupants left the estate at noon yesterday without offering resistance
Everything seems to indicate that the nightmare that the neighbors of the 51st Street of Balmes lived has come to an end.
Twelve people voluntarily abandoned the property they occupied illegally, and where they organized macrofestivals that desperate the neighborhood, by judicial order and without the need for a police intervention.
When the operation was completed, the door lock was changed to prevent the situation from repeating.
“From now on there will be access control,” the administrator said.
The okupas, who had invaded 11 of the 13 floors of the building - the rest are inhabited - took all the electrical installation and part of the water, in addition to painting the walls and leaving waste of all kinds, especially bottles of alcoholic beverages.
The first three floors were the scene of the crowded parties, which lasted up to two days and desperate the tenants.
Next to the building is a nightclub, Balmes 51, which has also been damaged.
Its owner, Maria Pantinat explained to Europa Press that since the building was occupied the business has fallen by 80%.
The owner of the nightclub points out that the invaders of the estate made unfair competition, as they sold the cups at three euros, while in the nightclub they were worth 10.
In addition, the owner of the leisure venue had had to respond to neighboring complaints for noise, while, according to him, the annoyances are not caused by the clients of the club, but by the inhabitants of the okupated house and, above all, the attendees to the parties that were organized there, which had increased their frequency and intensity in the last weeks, according to the angry neighbors of the area.
The manager of the club explained that the annoyances were so big that he even reached an agreement with the owner of the property and nine months ago that he "forgives" the rental.
The City Guard also confirmed that over the past few weeks it had received more complaints from neighbors about the situation.
The president of the municipal group of the PP in the municipality, Alberto Fernández Díaz, had claimed last week "to immediately remove the property to end the problems of coexistence and civism that produce the neighbors, as well as the degradation of the area".
The popular leader explained that before the summer there was only one floor of the building occupied, but over the past few months the okupas had been entering all floors of the building and almost every floor, and that in some even theft has occurred.
In this sense he added that, "it is necessary to end with impunity and be contundent against the incivism that has been generated in the estate."
Also yesterday, the Mossos evacuated a building in Nou Barris.
At 15.30 the police headed to the 35th of the street of Mont-ral, after receiving the call from a neighbor who had observed that four people were accessing the building.
All four were arrested at the time.
Park or mountain?
The architects agree on the opportunity of the call beyond polemics about fees
The municipal contest on the 16 doors reopens the debate on the role of Collserola in Barcelona
In the midst of the 80s, in the height of the already extinct Metropolitan Corporation of Barcelona (CMB), this Administration printed some promotional packages of Collserola.
The brochure defined the mountain as the great park of the metropolitan Barcelona.
Moreover, it was accompanied by a comparison, in figures, with New York’s Central Park.
With the death of the CMB, in 1987, the park was again situated, in the imaginary of many, as the upper boundary of Barcelona, being the Catalan capital of the few that are not oriented in the north-south axis but up (mountain) -down (sea).
The classification of Collserola as a natural park ends up in this idea.
The reference was no longer Central Park but Yellowstone, with the strawberries in the role of the Yogi bear.
In these it was until, in September, the municipality called for a mega competition composed of 16 competitions for other doors of access to Collserola.
A door reminds me of the idea of a park, no doubt.
Either that or someone wants to put doors in the field.
The question arises by itself: Collserola, park or mountain?
The contest, both for its merely organizational and for what it means to reflect on the city, is the subject of conversation among all Barcelona architects.
It’s almost already a recurring topic to take on when two members of this ancient cast of elected recognize themselves in an elevator.
And this fact gives way, justly, to one of the few coincidences between what three Barcelona architects, and university professors, have presented.
Miguel Roldán, Daniel Mòdol and Marta Bayona: the contest is appropriate.
For Roldán, after dealing with the coastal front "it is necessary" to debate on "the mountain front", since Ildefons Cerdà's speech, that of the green apples, has not been carried out.
“It starts from the fact that the most extensive park in Barcelona is the beach.
Especially because of its high accessibility.
Collserola is more complex,” sentences the architect for whom the title of “ports of Collserola” contains a “lexical trap”: there is no need to think of them “like accesses to a park, but the delimitation of a zone where it is necessary to act”.
Mòdol, like Roldán and Bayona with experience in the urban world, qualifies the proposal as “intellectual retreat” with “some dangers”.
Dangers derived from the “uncertainty that it is today to project the public space” after the experience lived in the 80s and that had in the area of the Forum “his singing of the swan”.
The first fear is the very delimitation of borders on where it can be built.
“To limit something is to set the next step,” that is, to exceed it.
“We need to think about new urban planning instruments, because the current [in reference to the Metropolitan General Plan (PGM)] can lead to real disasters.”
More tied to the question, Mòdol thinks that, simplifying, the valley side of Collserola "can be understood as a park, that of Barcelona, not", by a mere topographic question.
Mòdol recalls that there is already a work done by the Patronat of Collserola that "should not fall into a broken sack", although he thanks the opportunity that the municipality offers its gremio to intervene in this project "from the first moment".
And even more, he understands that the proximity of the mountain to the city is the salvoconducto that allows architects to enter the debate, but "doubts" about whether this technical profile should lead the multidisciplinary teams ("all a deal," he points out) that have had to create: "Architects should be only a tool."
Bayona insinuates that the answer to the question that gives title to this piece is complex, because in the bases of the contest a global vision of Collserola is missing: "Sixteen transversal competitions have been convened - he says - in the mountain-sea sense, but there is no longitudinal reading, which sees and understands the area as a whole."
That causes, at least in its case, that he has opted to participate in the 16 competitions.
Otherwise, a project for one of the doors can collide in program and definition with that of the architect of the next door.
In its opinion, that is, the municipality should ensure that the strait immediately above the Dalt Ronde should provide, in all its extent, a zone of equipment that would make a smooth transition between the city and the green.
Casino forgives Jonás Larrazábal and will be released
After 72 days of rooting, the law enforcement of Casino Red granted pardon to the brother of the mayor of Monterrey of the process that was followed by alleged blackmails
After remaining 72 days in prison, Manuel Jonás Larrazábal will be released after the law enforcement of Casino Red granted him forgiveness before the Second District Criminal Court, which follows a trial for blackmail against the brother of the mayor of Monterrey.
Following the attack on the Casino Royale, the owner of the Casino Red, Sergio Gil García, made public a series of photographs and videos in which Manuel Jonás allegedly demanded the payment of an economic fee for the municipality to allow the clandestine operation of the bookmaker.
Following the public complaint, the State Prosecutor’s Office opened a criminal case against the brother of the mayor and on 2 September he was detained and imprisoned for 30 days.
After four hours before the Public Ministry Officer 3 in Patrimonial Crimes, he was transferred to the House of Arraigo 1, located in the Old Quarter of the state capital.
He remained there for the following 49 days when a second order was issued after the Public Prosecutor’s officer rejected the crimes of bribery and organized crime.
On October 19, he was transferred to the Cadereyta penalty allegedly for blackmailing with one million and a half pounds to the owners of the Red Casino; however, he only remained for a few hours in the middle-security reclusion since there were death threats against him.
The authorities allowed him to follow the trial interned in the municipal cells of San Nicolás de los Garza.
On October 25, he was arrested by the secretary of the Second District Criminal Court, Jorge Yánez, who said that after almost two months of investigations sufficient evidence was found to determine Jonás' guilt, such as the collection of 1.5 million pesos to the representatives of the bookmaker in exchange for allowing the operation of the same.
On Monday, Casino Red’s legal leader, Víctor Aldo García Gómez, went to judge José Luis Pecina to request forgiveness for the brother of the regional mayor; so in the coming hours he could recover his freedom.
During the legal diligence, the Public Ministry agent, Ramiro Arias, questioned García Gómez if the damage had been repaired and who of the partners of the betting house was the one who granted forgiveness, although the lawyer tried to reserve the name.
On the basis of the case 197/2011 the legal forgiveness is granted to Jonás Larrazábal and subsequently no claim can be filed around the process that was followed; in addition, no reparation of damage or punishment will be demanded.
After the hearing to the legal authority of the bookmaker, around 15:50 the immediate release of Larrazabal Bretón was ordered.
The secretary of the court, Jorge Yánez, moved to the prison of the municipality of San Nicolás de los Garza to notify Jonás that he has been legally forgiven and his case will be filed.
He will also notify you of the immediate release order issued by the judge.
Secretary Dionisio Pérez Jácome gives details of the plane crash where the Secretary of Government, Francisco Blake, and seven other people lost their lives
The Ministry of Communications and Transportation (SCT) that the results of the crash in which the Secretary of Government, Francisco Blake Mora, and seven other people died indicate that the helicopter impacted directly on the ground in complete structural integrity, without the pilot being able to attempt a forced landing.
During a press conference, Dionisio Pérez Jácome, Secretary of Communications and Transport, mentioned that before taking off the aircraft, the pilot found that the weather conditions were the right to fly.
"The elements that appear to indicate that the unit had several contacts with the ground, the aspas had contact with trees at 25 meters where the unit lost the fuselage."
He also that the unit was designed for 19 people, so it had the necessary requirements to transport the personnel.
In addition, he said that in the investigations carried out in the impact area, the appearance of pieces on the ground is not.
“In a search it is that there are no parts or components of the ship elsewhere, the impact was presented in a structural way.
"The helicopter was designed for 19 passengers, it had adequate requirements for carrying passengers.
The terrain has a slope of seven degrees at 30 degrees of inclination.
At the moment, the secretary assured that it is a priority to get the results as soon as possible; however, the investigation can take several months, could even reach a year.
For his part, Gilberto López Meyer, director general of airports and auxiliary services, said that at the time of the impact, the helicopter operated at cruise speed and that this happened on soft ground.
"This information strengthens the hypothesis of a normal cruise operation at the time of the impact," he said.
At the press conference, the head of the SCT, Pérez Jácome, listed six relevant elements in the investigation:
The visual flight:
According to aeronautical regulations, the flight was carried out under visual flight rules, which implies that the crew must have visibility during flight and on the ground.
The meteorological conditions:
Reports in the AICM placed suitable conditions for the take-off, as the aircraft advances to the border area between the DF and the State of Mexico, layers of cloudiness were presented at low height.
Selected routes :
It is likely that due to the cloudy conditions the crew has sought a zone of lower elevation and greater visibility towards the valley of Cuernavaca.
Location of impact.
The impact coordinates and the latest record of the radar aircraft coincide, probably before the impact there was no loss of control or alteration in the flight trajectory.
Dispersion of remains of the aircraft in a reduced area:
The information available so far allows us to assume that the impact occurred in a straight and sideway trajectory.
The pattern of dispersal of the aircraft’s debris allows to assume that the helicopter hit the ground under conditions of structural integrity.
No evidence of fire or explosion was detected.
On the site of the accident, there is still no evidence on the remains of the ship of some kind of explosion or fire.
The latest findings indicate that he may have had multiple contacts with the ground.
During field work, parts of the aircraft have been found at an elevation of 9,200 feet above the middle sea level, the terrain has a slope ranging from seven degrees to 30 degrees of inclination.
The photographs show the sequence in which it was predicted to have disintegrated throughout the course.
The information provides elements that appear to indicate that the helicopter may have had multiple impacts on the ground.
After thorough searches in a wider area than the agreed site around the crash, no scattered parts of the aircraft have been found, strengthening the presumption that the impact occurred under conditions of structural integrity.
MSS Announces Protocol to Find Obesity Gene
Social Security conducts a research to discover the obesity gene in children and young people; it is supported by IPN specialists
The Mexican Institute of Social Security (IMSS) has announced that it is conducting a research to discover the obesity gene in children and young people, called the Protocol 'Genetics of obesity in childhood and adolescence', which will allow to have markers associated with overweight.
In a statement, the head of the Medical Research Unit in Biochemistry of the Hospital of Specialties of the National Medical Center XXI Century, Miguel Cruz López, explained that a multidisciplinary team of doctors, nurses, nutritionists and social workers was integrated.
This team is supported by specialists and postgraduate students from the National Institute of Public Health (INSP) and the National Polytechnic Institute (IPN) Center for Research and Advanced Studies (Cinvestav).
In the investigation is invited to participate the population whether or not right-speaking, go to the participating sports units of the IMSS in the Valley of Mexico, where the tests are carried out to the minors, every Saturday from 8:00 hours.
He noted that the protocol began in the Cuauhtémoc Sports Unit (Mexico Poniente State) and that since October 8, the activity is carried out in the Nezahualcóyolt Sports Unit (Mexico East State).
Once the goal of meeting 500 or 600 minors is met, the study will continue in the Independence Sports Unit (south of the Federal District) and finally in the Morelos Sports Unit (north of the Federal District).
He explained that the purpose of this research is to know the components and importance of genetics with respect to the development of obesity and to identify in Mexican children and young people risk factors to prevent the appearance of chronic degenerative diseases.
On November 14, World Diabetes Day, the goal is to bring together 3,000 children and young people between the ages of six and 14, with the consent and supervision of their parents, for the application of specific food questionnaires.
They will also be asked about physical activity and hereditary family history of diseases, in order to avoid risk factors that trigger diseases such as diabetes or renal failure.
He detailed that on Saturdays all participants are applied to anthropometric measurements (weight, height, waist circumference), blood pressure, determination of glucose, triglyceride, cholesterol and insulin levels and genetics (it is sought to identify genes that are associated with childhood obesity).
Cruz López noted that this research obeyed the concern of health professionals about the alarming weight gain in minors.
“The health surveys of 1999 and 2006 showed that in just six years there was an increase in obesity of 77% in children and 47% in girls; in terms of overweight, a dramatic rise was also observed,” said the IMSS specialist.
He indicated that the justification for the search for markers is based on the fact that the country’s population differs from others by its genetic history.
He that on average, the Mexican has 65 percent Indian American inheritance, 30 percent European and five percent African and this condition is reflected in the genes associated with diabetes and overweight.
He explained that in general, the genetics of obesity translates into the inability to burn the excess energy we consume (calories) and that is stored in the form of fat.
The researcher explained that the direct benefit for participants is the comprehensive evaluation of the children, which allows to detect whether they present some degree of overweight or obesity.
Even, he said, the presence of dark-colored folds (acantosis) in the neck and forearm, which indicate the likelihood that he will suffer from metabolic alterations and even prediabetes.
The information is handled confidentially, doctors deliver it in writing to parents, who are explained to each of the measurements and lifestyle changes they need to make to prevent diseases.
Cruz Lopez explained that there are three main components that cause overweight, obesity and other chronic ailments: sedentarism, which is the lack of daily physical activity, staying most of the day sitting in front of the TV and using means of transport instead of walking short distances.
It is also due to high calorie intake, that is, the increased consumption of sugary beverages, carbohydrates (tams, bread, pizza, hamburger, etc.) with high content in fats and proteins and the genetics that are analyzed in this protocol.
Asphalt of the UNAM would avoid bats
Rafael Herrera, a researcher at the Faculty of Chemistry at UNAM, develops asphalt modified with polymers to produce a mixture with better performance, regardless of environmental conditions and temperature
If the signals sent by the floor were taken care of, it would not be necessary to repair about 200,000 beams each rainy season in the Mexico Valley Metropolitan Zone, warned Rafael Herrera Nájera, a researcher at the UNAM Faculty of Chemistry (FQ), who assured that if the construction and maintenance process of an asphalt floor is appropriate, the beams could be reduced in quantity or even completely eliminated.
In its conference A technological opinion of the beams, dictated within the framework of the International Year of Chemistry, gave to know that the laboratory to its charge develops asphalt modified with polymers to produce a mixture with characteristics similar to those of asphalt, but with a greater mechanical resistance, both at high and low temperatures.
Herrera Nájera estimated that this type of modified asphalt could be used in places where the climate is extremely hot, such as some cities in the north of the country, to improve their performance and, therefore, the formation of beams.
He explained that asphalt, the heaviest part of oil, is a set of hydrocarbon molecules, some of high molecular weight, called asphalt, and others of low molecular weight, called maltens, which together give the pavement its characteristic viscoelastic behavior.
The viscoelastic behavior of asphalt consists in that at high temperatures, near 180 degrees, it behaves like a liquid, at 120 degrees Celsius its viscosity is very high and at 50 degrees Celsius it presents a solid state, while at very low temperatures, the asphalt becomes broken, he added.
The above means that on the streets the resistance of asphalt is not uniform, but is modified during the day according to environmental conditions and temperature, the chemical engineering specialist warned.
The FQ researcher observed that the streets of Mexico City are mostly covered by flexible flooring, which consists of six layers of materials, the last three of which involve asphalt.
Among the most superficial layers is the asphalt carpet, formed by small stones bathed in asphalt and then compacted.
Each of the stones that constitutes the folder, he pointed out, is bathed with asphalt.
By transiting the vehicles and generating efforts, this allows the forces to spread very well on the floor.
If it were modified asphalt, it would spread even better, the chemical engineer said.
On the asphalt folder, abundantly, a last layer is placed called a rolling folder, which is made of a fine stone material, that is, a sand that is also bathed in asphalt.
As it is the layer that will be in contact with vehicle tyres, it must have more mechanical strength than the asphalt carpet and provide friction on the road.
Being the part of the floor that will receive and spread the efforts, the rolling folder also requires having the right thickness and the material of which it is made should be taken care of.
Climate, especially humidity and temperature variations, are also a very important factor to consider, especially water, he said, because it significantly affects the performance of the asphalt folder.
When the soil moistures, the water diffuses inside the folder and it is difficult to leave, this causes a brushing of all layers of the floor and, therefore, the formation of bars.
In the process of forming a barrel, he said, the first to wear out is the bearing film and only then the asphalt folder is affected, but the damage does not occur instantly, but it is a process that should be addressed at the first signs with appropriate maintenance programs.
The also member of the National System of Investigators explained that the vehicle load is another important factor in the formation of beams and, therefore, the thickness of each of the layers of the flooring must always go in relation to the vehicle load and ensure that it is met, to prevent beams from forming frequently.
Rafael Herrera warned that there is still much to be investigated and worked on asphalt, for example, asphalt emulsions, which in other countries are already even on the market and allow repairing the beams with ease and without the need to use high temperatures.
What was missing from the candidate to be the new Miss Colombia?
Analysis of the factors that caused Melina Ramírez Serna not to reach the Crown of Señorita Colombia.
The valley receives its 14th title of princess.
Once again, the valley of the Cauca is left with the wishes of the crown of Señorita Colombia.
This time Melina Ramírez Serna had to conform to being on the podium of winners, to shine the silver crown and the band that accredit her as the new princess of Colombia.
With the result obtained last night in Cartagena, where the Miss Atlantic rose with the crown and the scepter, the department has already added 14 titles of Princess and Melina to the legion of vallecaucan women who have been close to the crown but who were proclaimed princesses among them Miriam Ospina Benoit (1947), Clara Domínguez Borrero (1949), Patricia Bellini Ayala (1979), Lorena Álvarez (1981), Rose Mary Alzate (1983), Olga María Arenas (1987), Leila Blanque (1988), Mónica Evers (1989), María Consuela Pinedo (1990), Diana Isabel Romero (1993), Giselle Garcés Aljure (2000), Catalina Giraldo (2007), Stephanie Garcés Aljure (2008).
The big question that many people are asking is what is missing?
Because the result represents the defeat of a great favorite who in each presentation demonstrated that she had everything to be the new Miss Colombia, not in vain was elected Queen of the Police and Best Face Jolie of Vogue, titles that obtained queens like Taliana Vargas or Natalia Navarro who took the crown of Miss Colombia.
The first factor that is considered key in the decision that the jury took to designate her First Princess lies in that she did not convince with her answer to the question "What is that book that has marked you and why? made by Martín Murillo Gómez, of the Leamos Literary Paper.
To the question the vallecaucana replied:
“I read a lot, I believe a lot in literature, I think it’s a way to culturalize, I definitely think the book that marked me from childhood is ‘The Little Prince’, it’s a pretty deep book.
Currently I am reading “Crime and Punishment,” is a book of universal literature that we should all read; and today I am reading the book of Irene Nemirovsky, a Russian, a beautiful book called “The Burning of Blood.”
A response that little liked first for the term "culturalizing" and second for not explaining in a concrete way how each of the books he quoted have marked it.
But at the end of the ceremony Melina expressed feeling calm and happy with the result "the universe is wise passes what has to happen.
And for everyone, please read a little, “The Little Prince” is a great book.”
Among the hypotheses it is said that Valle was burned by favoritism.
A Bogotá journalist insinuated that by being the favorite, the acclaimed and the candidate who wore all the preliminary awards (Oster gastronomy rite, public vote for the best crafted suit, and Queen Mother), “this aroused the jealousy of the other candidates, stressed the queen and for that reason did not shine on the stage.”
And that was noticed in her first show in a bathing suit on the Hilton Beach and her two parades on the coronation evening.
Although she looked safe in both, it was noted that she lacked the strength and momentum that the representatives of Magdalene and Atlantic proved.
Ariel Osorio, a journalist on the RCN channel’s “How at Home” program, said that the fact that Melina was named a princess “proves that the candidate who wins the most awards during the contest does not remain as queen.”
In addition, Valle showed himself to the last very shy with the press, and there he was wrong.
Another hypothesis is that Valle failed to convince the jury about his interest in social labor, which is in the last, the essence of the National Beauty Contest.
For some reason, two days before the election the international jury Lucy Doughty stated that they were looking for a woman committed to the social needs of their country.
"Beauty alone is not enough in a Miss Colombia, you have to look beyond the physical and focus on your social sensitivity, that before entering the contest are already involved in projects," she explained.
It is also speculated that Valle sinned for his defects in the derriere and fibrosis that was noted in his abdomen, but it is contradictory because precisely the jury chose her as the candidate 'Natural Beauty' with the healthiest body, good food and responsible physical work.
Queen preparer Jorge Hernán Orozco recognises that Melina did not have the best body, that there were better, "but her abdominal fibrosis problem, which the truth for me was not very notorious, dropped her points on the last day."
Meanwhile, journalist Guido Hoyos, of the Cromos magazine, considers that the vallecaucan error was the surgical interventions that were practiced.
“The surgeries are fine, but Valle didn’t know how to do them.
Her body was never her stronger and here they were charged.”
For this award, which for the first time delivers the National Beauty Contest, after the parade in bathing suit a cruel vaticinium arose that last night was fulfilled, since it was said that this was the contentillo that Raymundo granted to Melina not to give her the taste of the crown.
Reality or not, the truth is that Melina from today begins a year of reign, not as a sovereign, but as a princess, position that gives her the possibility to represent Colombia in one of the international competitions by designation of the national contest itself.
However, she will pass into history as one of the queens who, despite her overwhelming passage through Cartagena, escaped her crown.
So was the work of the calf that identified the body of Alfonso Cano
A lofoscopist from Cali went into history as the man who confirmed the death of Alfonso Cano.
The work of these officials is key.
On November 4, a lofoscopist from Cali’s CTI came into history as the man who confirmed the identity of the FARC’s highest chief: “Alfonso Cano,” through his fingerprints.
Of the seven lofoscopists working in the CTI section, that week the turn of "availability" was touched by Eliazar González, a man from Puerto Tejada who has been working in the judicial investigation area for 21 years.
At the beginning of his career, González worked in municipalities of Chocó, where he often had to be interned for more than five days in the jungle to get to the site where the corpses were to be identified.
In 2000 he moved to the capital of the Valley and, after taking the corresponding courses, specialized in lofoscopy, which is the study of friction skin, that is, of the palms of the hands and feet.
The week of the operative against alias Alfonso Cano, Eliazar was warned to wear minimum clothes for three days.
Something big was waiting for him.
On Friday night he left for the Cauca in a helicopter from Palmira.
He knew that he had to identify two bodies and that one of them was suspected to be from the man who directed the oldest guerrilla in the world, so they asked him to carry the decadental card of Guillermo León Sáenz (his real name).
However, when he arrived with the research team to the site where the body was found, he did not recognize it for its physical appearance, as it was very different from what he had seen in the media.
He was without a beard, dressed like a local peasant, without glasses and much thinner.
But the footprints don’t lie.
Accompanied by a galtonian lupa, ink, a transplant and a lantern, Eliazar compared the fingerprints of the corpse with those of the card.
His eye did not fail: it was Alfonso Cano.
That same night, the man from Puerto Tejada was in charge of confirming to the Minister of Defense, Juan Carlos Pinzón, that it was the maximum head of the FARC.
In Search of the Footprint
For a dactyloscopist of the Sijín de Cali the recognition that President Juan Manuel Santos made to Eliazar González, in the press conference for the operative against "Cano", is very significant.
Many people do not know our work.
Dactyloscopy is an accurate science, without margin of error, which can become key in the resolution of crimes.
Apart from identifying bodies, lofoscopists support investigations for crimes such as theft and murder and confirm the identities of the captured people.
When captured, many criminals present fake cards or lack papers.
We take their fingerprints and look for them in the database.
The investigator said that, in a case of theft, he was touched by taking a piece of wall from a house, because in that place the thief had supported his hand to pull out a strong box full of jewelry and money.
"The walls are difficult because they are not suitable surfaces to make a fingerprint, but in that case we were able to get the footprint of the whole hand and identify the offender, who had participated in different thefts," he recalled.
Footprints can also dismiss or reaffirm suspects in cases of murder.
They recently found a man dead, with bottles of alcohol around him.
By means of the investigation it was determined that a relative could be suspected of the crime and, effectively, a footprint on the bottle coincided.
Although this does not guarantee that he was the murderer, it places him on the crime scene.
A fingerprint scanner from the CTI explained that on the objects “footprints are taken with chemical or physical reagents.”
When they appear, a transplant or tape is used to lift them.
After this, the prints are sent to the Asif, which is the criminal database, or to the Registry.
“The problem is that there are still many undocumented Colombians,” the CTI expert said.
He explained that not everything is as shown in the CSI television program.
As not everything that shines is gold, not everything that is touched becomes footprint.
However, if it can be used, if the respective coating is carried out.
The "indignants" challenge authorities in New York
Hundreds of protesters gathered in front of Zuccotti Square to camp.
A large part attended the order of displacement and moved to a nearby paruqe.
Members of the Occupy Wall Street movement challenged New York authorities on Tuesday by trying to enter again, under a court order, to Manhattan Square where they were displaced early in the morning and trying to occupy another Big Apple park.
Hundreds of protesters gathered in front of Zuccotti Square, where they wanted to access thanks to a court order that allows the "indignants" to camp again, while another part of the movement responded to the displacement by occupying a park further north of the city, where there have been new arrests.
“Our idea is that if the court does not allow us to camp again on the square, we will settle somewhere else and continue the legal battle to return to Zuccotti, as well as through peaceful seats and demonstrations,” said Mark Bray, a spokesman for the Occupy Wall Street movement.
Bray detailed that the "indignant" response to the displacement of their camp personally dictated by New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg came to the courts, where judge Lucy Billings issued an order prohibiting forced evacuation from the place and allowing protesters to stay camped.
In addition, the "indignants" proceeded to the occupation of a new park located at the confluence of the central Canal Street and Sixth Avenue, very close to the entrance to the Holland tunnel, which connects New York and New Jersey, and owned by the Trinity Church parish.
At least for an hour they managed to occupy the place, but then the police came and stopped some of the protesters, although Bray could not confirm the specific figure, while assuring Efe that he saw several journalists who were also married.
The organization assures that several hundred people have been installed at that point, where a delegation of religious leaders has already been displaced in support of the members of the movement and has tried to mediate with the police.
Meanwhile, the Zuccotti Square - which is a private property site - remains closed in anticipation of the celebration of a judicial view scheduled for this same Tuesday in which the legality of the evacuation of this morning should be analyzed.
Some of the protesters displaced so far carried and distributed copies of that judicial order and even handed them over to agents who guarded the square, which provoked "some small clashes," Bray said, who that some officials fired strikes on the protesters.
The court order prohibits authorities from evicting members of Occupy Wall Street or enforcing “laws that were issued after the occupation began or prohibiting protesters from accessing the park again with stores or other properties they used previously.”
Mayor Bloomberg told the press that, due to that court order, the city had suspended the reopening of the space to the public and protesters, who he warned, however, that local laws do not allow them to re-install with campaign stores and sleeping bags.
The mayor personally defended the evacuation carried out in the early hours of Zuccotti Square, an operation in which about 200 arrests were carried out and that was decided because the protesters were "violating the law".
Bloomberg explained that he gave the order to evacuate the square because it was becoming "a place where people were not coming to protest, but to violate laws and, in some cases, to harm other people," as "some had received threats" and neighbors feared "for their quality of life."
"The displacement this morning was ugly and shows that Bloomberg is more interested in preserving financial interests than those of U.S. workers," the movement's spokesman added, who accused the mayor of "faltering respect for freedom of expression."
Occupy Wall Street officials also said they are planning to organize "great actions" on Thursday in collaboration with community organizations and trade unions to commemorate the two months of protests that began on September 17.
Pamela Anderson will play the Virgin Mary in a Christmas TV special
Along with Michael Bublé and other prominent Canadians, he will appear on the television show "It's a Russell Peters Christmas" on December 1st.
Canadian Pamela Anderson has been Tim Allen's assistant in "Home Improvement", rescue player in "Baywatch", rabbit of "Playboy", the wife of rock musician Tommy Lee and now, the actress and model will be the Virgin Mary in a Christmas special on Canadian television.
Private television channel CTV announced today that Anderson, along with Crooner Michael Bublé and other prominent Canadians, will appear on the television show "It's a Russell Peters Christmas" on December 1st, giving life to a very particular Virgin Mary.
CTV distributed images from the television program in which Anderson, also known for the wide distribution on the internet of a pornographic video in which she appears along with her then husband, the drummer of "Mötley Crüe", Tommy Lee, dressed as the Virgin Mary holding a puppet representing Jesus.
In the scene, Peters, a well-known Canadian comedian of Indian origin who recently acted as a host on part of Charlie Sheen's "My Violent Torpedo of Truth" tour, appears as José.
In addition to Anderson and Peters, CTV's Christmas special features Canadian singer Bublé, who married the Argentine model Luisana Lopilato in Buenos Aires in late March, and who is not strange to the controversy.
Recently, Bublé called Kim Kardashian "sorra" during one of her concerts in New York.
Japan recovers after earthquake
GDP grows 1.5 percent thanks to domestic consumption and ends fall spiral that began in March
Since last March, the Japanese economy has been paralyzed, even overwhelming by the devastating earthquake that turned into a nuclear crisis, the worst catastrophe that has suffered the country since World War II.
The Tokyo government's initial estimates estimated the material losses at $300 billion, a blow that, despite the difficult global context, seems to have mitigated.
After three consecutive quarters of falls, the Gross Domestic Product data between July and September served to pass a page, definitely: GDP increased by 1.5% compared to the previous quarter and 6% in annual rate.
Recorded in the second quarter – for the Japanese, the fiscal year begins in March 2012 – also represents the highest growth rate since the January-March 2010 period.
The recovery is explained, in part, by the rise in the purchase of machinery to restore the areas devastated by the quake and the subsequent tsunami.
In fact, the companies increased their investments by 1.1%, compared to the 0.9% drop in capital spending that was observed from January to March, the first downturn after six months of uninterrupted rises.
However, the real revulsive of the Japanese economy is not based solely on the Keynesian impulse that invites us to take advantage of the crises to strengthen – or rebuild – the infrastructure, to use the shortages to grow from scratch.
Japan has awakened, mainly, thanks to the evolution of domestic consumption, which currently accounts for 60% of Japan’s GDP.
This variable increased by 1%, driven by increased spending on vehicles, travel and leisure activities.
The Stigma of the Yen
Tokyo has entrusted itself to the domestic market, when the yen – the Japanese currency – has become one of the “refuge values” chosen by investors fleeing the euro zone debt crisis and the turbulent U.S. forecasts, a privilege that weighs like a loose on the accounts of exporting companies.
With a stronger currency, products are more expensive abroad, a serious reverse for a country whose economic floating line is determined by the health of large technological groups.
Toyota and Sony, for example, attributed their weak results between July and September to the yen.
While markets continue to siege the EU’s peripheral countries, Yoshihiko Noda’s government does not lower the guard.
“We must be alert to the risks that persist, such as the deterioration of some foreign economies, the impact of the floods in Thailand and the rapid appreciation of the yen,” said State Secretary of Economic Policy Motohisa Furukawa.
The prospects are not encouraging.
The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) said the majority of member countries showed sharper signs of economic slowdown in September.
The indicator that predicts the turning points in the world economy highlighted that the main powers are slowing down.
It dropped four-tenths to the 100,4 points, against the 100,8 in August.
The eurozone, even, was below the average, which is at level 100, by precipitating eight-tenths to 99.13 points.
Athens raises doubts again
Papadimos says adjustments will be approved, but conservatives will not sign any written commitment
With peripheral risk premiums shattered and uncertainty re-installed in parquets, Greece continues to get stuck in the maze that leads to the exit from the great European debt crisis.
The feeling that the “consensus” of the new Hellenic transitional government is more imposed by the demands of Brussels than by a genuine conviction of the political forces begins to be confirmed by facts.
While the new prime minister, Lukas Papadimos, warned yesterday that there is no alternative to structural reforms and that the one hundred-day period agreed on his appointment may be short to apply them, the leader of the conservative party New Democracy, Antonis Samaras, assured that he will not support new austerity measures in any case and reiterated his demand for new elections for the scheduled date, February 19.
"The main task of this government is to apply the decisions of the October 26 summit," Papadimos said in an open parliamentary debate that will culminate tomorrow with a vote of confidence to the new executive.
A package of 24 programmes to boost employment, reform of the official disciplinary code and new measures against tax evasion will be the first initiatives.
However, Samaras’ message does not clear doubts about his position: “We have committed to helping the transitional government, but we have not committed to anything else.”
The Conservative leader went a step further in his pulse to the EU and the IMF, the agencies that should unlock the $8 billion that Athens urgently needs, and made it clear that he will not give his veto to any letter of commitment to comply with the adjustments.
But the European Commission, shocked by the impact of Papandreu's referendum, reiterated yesterday that its demand is firm: it will not unblock aid if the new government and the leaders of the main Hellenic parties do not sign "a written commitment without ambiguity and as soon as possible".
Economic Affairs spokesman Amadeu Altafaj said the troika inspectors would return "very soon" to Athens to discuss with the new government "what is needed to pay the sixth tranche" of 8 billion, although there is no definitive date.
The Greek wood still has thread for a while.
Doña Sofía: “They are instruments for progress and hope”
The Queen highlights Spain's "preponderant" place in relation to this type of finance
Spain “has achieved a preponderant place at the global level in the role of Microfinance.”
Queen Sofia recalled yesterday that the country has become in these two last decades the second donor of the proposal in relation to this cooperation instrument, whose "essence" said it lies in being a "instrument for social progress, justice and hope of a better future for all humanity, based on confidence in the human being".
The Queen inaugurated the fifth World Micro-Credit Summit in Valladolid with the conviction that "there is no doubt" that this type of operations are "absolutely indispensable" to the Millennium Goals established by the United Nations with the horizon of 2015, and, "very especially, in that which aims to reduce to half the volume of people who live with incomes below a daily dollar, with which the "poor of poverty" is fixed.
Spain "continues to work" to expand the network of beneficiaries "to all corners of the planet, and assumes this task with "responsibility", said Doña Sofía, who hoped that the initiatives and contributions that originate in the Summit, which will be extended until Thursday, "guarantee the creation of new capabilities and better opportunities for the poorest, and especially for the main women", beneficiaries of these loans.
There are “many achievements achieved” and “many challenges we face.”
The Microcrédit Summit is not only a forum for debate, but also the platform from which to promote “two basic goals”.
His Majesty explained that it aims that by the end of 2015 175 million poor families have access to these financial services and that 100 million of those households leave the poverty threshold in which they are sinking.
The momentum in the conception of micro-credits in Spain and the rest of the world “has followed the path initiated years ago in a pioneering way” by Muhammad Yunus, said Doña Sofía as an “act of justice and due recognition”.
He described the father of this tool as an "admirable idealist in the universal cause of the fight against poverty", whose work he has known since 15 years ago, when the Queen traveled to Bangladesh to know on the ground her policy of loans.
This experience was followed a year later by the first World Summit in Washington and other meetings such as those held in Côte d’Ivoire in 1999, Canada in 2006, and “in all I have been able to see the continuous evolution,” explained His Majesty, whose link with this project was worth yesterday the qualification of the “head of family” gathered in Valladolid by the “poor man”.
Finally, Queen Doña Sofia concluded her speech encouraging the present to participate in the debate and in the search for solutions to advance the fight against poverty.
“Ethical imperative”
Foreign Minister Trinidad Jiménez warned that solidarity "is an ethical imperative" for every democratic state.
In this sense, he stated that it would be a mistake to link cooperation with developing countries to times of economic prosperity, since it is a "permanent obligation".
Jiménez said that micro-credit is "a serious and rigorous policy dedicated to eradicating poverty", and now "more than ever" governments in developed countries should work under criteria of solidarity and not let it be a victim of the cuts.
For Spain, micro-credit is “one of the main lines of development cooperation.”
For its part, the Secretary of State for International Cooperation, Soraya Rodríguez, applauded "the success" of giving "confidence" to people "excluded from who all close the doors"; and the mayor of Valladolid, Francisco Javier León de la Riva, welcomed the present to a city that "opens its doors contained by the spirit of solidarity".
The CDU proposes to elect the European President by universal suffrage
The first day of the congress of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU), on Monday, November 14, in Leipzig, has passed without great difficulties for Angela Merkel, Chancellor and President of the Christian Democratic Party.
Initially the future of Europe had not been included on the agenda, but the topic was imposed in the fall, in particular to satisfy militants who consider the government’s policy is currently too unstrict with the Greeks and could be so in the future with the Italians.
The motion on the Presidency of the European Commission, proposed by the management, was adopted virtually unanimously.
Of the 1,001 delegates, only nine votes against and ten abstentions were registered.
The standing ovation of several minutes won, with her interventions, Angela Merkel and, after several hours, Wolfgang Schäuble, the europhile Minister of Finance, dispel any possible doubt.
The key idea of the Chancellor, and of the motion, is summed up in a motto: the response to the crisis "is not less Europe, but more Europe".
Not only because Europe means peace, but also because “nine million jobs depend directly on the euro.”
For the Chancellor, “it’s time to open the way in Europe.”
This could manifest itself in amendments to the Lisbon Treaty to enable the European Union to strengthen control over the budgetary policies of the euro area countries, although it could also result in the election of the President of the European Commission by universal suffrage to “give a face to Europe”.
In any case, that is one of the proposals of the motion adopted by Congress, clearly Wolfgang Schäuble’s idea.
It is undoubtedly unlikely that the twenty-seven will quickly come to an agreement on this radical change: Britain is hostile to him and CDU leaders seem to know that Nicolas Sarkozy too.
The ball is on the ground.
On the other hand, delegates have rejected by an overwhelming majority the proposal to weigh the weight of each country’s ECB directive on the basis of the weight of each economy, which obviously would reinforce Germany’s weight.
Anxious to calm the spirits within her party, the Chancellor has increased references to Konrad Adenauer and Helmut Kohl. But it is also not that she has attempted to win her congress at the expense of the "small" European countries or the countries in difficulty willing to criticize the arrogant Germany.
Although the motion on Europe devotes a paragraph to the importance of "the Franco-German friendship", Angela Merkel has not mentioned France.
Except for the past.
Two centuries ago there was a bloody battle in Leipzig.
In fact, it was one of the most humiliating defeats for Napoleon's army.
The Incidence of Fraud in Disease Lows
After the subsidies, the UMP and the Government undertake an offensive against the sickness drops.
Nicolas Sarkozy will be on Tuesday 15 November in Bordeaux to visit a box responsible for family subsidies and deliver a speech on the topic, already recurring since 2007, of the fight against social fraud and aid.
In addition, to accompany such an offensive, which starts with the will to save in a rigorous way, but still reminds of an axis of the right-wing presidential campaign, the majority wants to focus on the sickness drops.
First, to apply budget cuts: the Government plans to impose on private sector workers a fourth day of shortage before they can catch the low.
In short, unless there is a specific company agreement, a worker who falls ill would lose four days of salary, that is, a minimum of 15% of their monthly income.
It is a measure that could raise a wave of anger, but would save 280 million euros, according to Les Echos.
In addition, it would be accompanied by another measure with a more symbolic scope: imposing on officials a day of absence without remuneration in case of low labor (until now, they do not lack, compared to the three days that are applied in the private sector).
While these issues are debated, the majority again puts on the table equally the issue of fraud, this time oriented towards the abuses of low labor.
“Controls will increase considerably and, in addition, if someone is discovered committing a fraud, they will have to reimburse the amounts,” Xavier Bertrand told RTL on Sunday.
As in other cases, the effects of the advertisement appear slightly disproportionate to the reality of fraud in the field of low-employment.
In fact, since 2002 this issue has been constantly monitored and various political offensives have been launched that have normally yielded fruit.
The French are not sick more than in the rest of Europe.
Let’s look at the national figures first.
According to the French Institute of Social Security (CNAM), in 2006 more than 237 million euros were paid in benefits for low labor.
According to the French Institute of Research and Documentation in Health Economy, subsidies for lowers accounted for 5% of the health expenditure in 2008, up to €11.3 billion.
Of this sum, 46% corresponds to maternity and occupational accidents, while 54% is related to illness, which amounts to 6.200 million euros.
That’s 2.5 percent of healthcare spending.
In 2010, French workers had an average of 14.5 days off work, compared to 17.8 in 2009, according to a study by the Alma Consulting group.
Another survey, published in 2007 by the Syrian professional management company Monster.com, showed that 75% of the 40,000 French employees surveyed claimed they had not taken a single day off for illness.
Another study, in this case of the Assurance disease, indicates that in 2010 37% of sickness losses had a duration of less than 8 days, 22% of between 8 and 14 days, 15% of between 15 days and a month, 15% of between one and three months and 11% were longer.
If we compare them with our European neighbors, French workers are not more likely than in other areas to catch sickness drops.
A long study conducted in 2010 by two CNRS researchers indicated that, between 1994 and 2001, the rate of global absence from work (both for health reasons and otherwise) ranged, in France, between 10% and 11%, against 20% and 28% in Denmark, 15% in the United Kingdom or between 16% and 18% in the Netherlands.
Sickness fraud is not significant compared to undeclared work.
Fraud has a rather limited scope.
The strengthening of the legislation, since 2002, has resulted in the systematic controls of illnesses for more than 45 days.
In 2008, of 1.5 million inspections, the CNAM verified, in 13% of the 285,000 carried out, that the short-lived drops were "unjustified or too long", that is, 37.050 cases.
In the case of the drops of more than 45 days, subjected to systematic inspections, it was considered that 11% of the cases were "duely adapted or unjustified; a figure that, having as a starting point a total of 1.2 million, rises to 132.000.
Consequently, a total of 169,000 “unjustified” cases are reached among several million workers who took a sick leave.
Definitely an insignificant figure in comparison, for example, with black work.
According to UMP MP Dominique Tian, author of a report on this issue in June, such a practice would represent a loss of tax revenues of between 9,000 and 15 billion euros per year, that is, more than the total cost of subsidies for low and, without a doubt, considerably more than fraud in this latter area.
Papademos: Greece must implement a new adjustment plan
Greece will need a new adjustment plan to correct its economy.
This is what Prime Minister Lucas Papadémos declared on Monday before the Parliament; he also added that the hundred days that have been granted to his government of union would not be enough to such a goal.
"To make efforts that lead to the recovery of the economy, we need the support of our European partners and a new budget adjustment program," he said, speaking his first public speech during the opening of the debate on the vote of confidence in Parliament on Wednesday.
The implementation of the decisions adopted during the euro zone summit on October 27 will be the “main task” of the new government, since the country’s stay in the euro area “is at stake,” he added.
Papadémos has forecast that the country’s public deficit will be reduced “up to around 9%” of GDP before the end of the year, after reaching 10.6% in 2010 and 15.7% in 2009.
EU rejects new austerity measures
Antonis Samaras, the head of the right-wing group, on Monday showed his support for the measures already approved to try to get out of the debt crisis, but warned that his party will not commit to additional austerity measures.
"We will not vote in favour of new measures," he said during a meeting with deputies from his party New Democracy.
He pointed out that he was in agreement with the objectives of reducing deficit and debt, as well as fighting waste, but opposed to any policies that impede economic recovery.
To Olli Rehn, European Commissioner for Economic and Monetary Affairs, who warned that the IMF and the EU would not unlock the necessary €8 trillion loan without a written guarantee of the support of all parties to the measures planned, Antonio Samaras replied that his word would be enough and that he would not sign anything because of external pressure.
A committee of experts says euthanasia and assisted suicide should be legalized
Canadians live by denying death, according to the Royal Society of Canada report
In palliative care, the committee calls for governments, healthcare institutions and doctors to work together to ensure the best palliative care, and not just in cases of cancer.
Canadian society lives by denying death.
In fact, only 9% of Canadians are willing to talk to their doctor about the conditions in which they wish to die and make arrangements for that purpose.
This is one of the findings of an imposing report by the Royal Society of Canada, which included six experts from various fields, including ethics, law and medicine.
This committee recommends that the Government amend the Criminal Code in such a way that assisted suicide and euthanasia are permitted, when the patient poses such an option and has been judged competent to make the decision.
To begin with, experts cite a recent survey by the Economist Intelligence Unit that compared the quality of death in 40 countries around the world.
Although Canada ranks 10th, the study notes that “the medicalization of death in Canada has generated a culture in which people are afraid to deal with the subject of death.”
With or without medication, 77% of Canadians do not have access to palliative care, according to experts selected by the Royal Society of Canada.
And, despite the fact that most Canadians wish to die at home, 68.6% of them end up dying in the hospital.
Overall, the highest rate in this sense is recorded in Quebec, where 86% of deaths occur in hospitals.
Regarding the delicate issue of euthanasia and assisted suicide, the authors of the report came to conclusions that do not coincide with the position of the federal government, which has already declared that it does not wish to amend the Criminal Code in relation to euthanasia and assisted suicide.
However, according to experts, who have also studied the situation in all countries where such practices have been legalized or do not constitute a criminal offence, there is no evidence that the fact that they are not considered a criminal offence has not resulted in an abuse of their application, i.e. the use of euthanasia or assisted suicide with non-competent persons or who had not given their consent.
Jocelyn Downie, co-author of the report, said on a teleconference that, on the contrary, more excesses were observed in those countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide have not been legalized.
“Euthanasia is practiced in Canada, although it is clearly illegal.”
“In Canada, assisted suicide is practiced, although it is clearly illegal,” says Jocelyn Downie.
Canadians in favor of euthanasia
Remember that 85% of Canadians have already spoken out in favor of euthanasia, as they think it would allow people whose death is near to alleviate their suffering, according to an Angus Reid survey conducted in 2010.
In addition, 66% believe that the fact of legalizing euthanasia will not mean that the lives of the elderly or disabled people have less value.
As for people who have practiced assisted suicide, 41% of respondents believe that no trial should be initiated against them.
In relation to the maintenance or interruption of health care to a patient, the situation is not so clear, according to the authors of the report.
In addition, among their recommendations they suggest that it be indicated in the Criminal Code that the withdrawal of health care, if they have been legally rejected, does not constitute a criminal offence.
The committee also calls for healthcare professionals to be trained in the duty to respect the fact that a patient refuses assistance at the end of his life without fear of facing a complaint.
In palliative care, the committee calls for governments, healthcare institutions and doctors to work together to ensure the best palliative care, and not just in cases of cancer.
Finally, in relation to palliative or terminal sedation, which is already widely used in Canadian health institutions, the committee asks that, unless it serves to reduce physical pain, it be considered euthanasia and subjected to the same procedures.
Experts have expressed reservations
Other experts in the field of health law have already expressed their concerns about the findings of the report of the experts of the Royal Society of Canada.
Pierre Deschamps, a specialist in health law, called the position of the experts who sign the report "extreme", among other things because the practice of euthanasia is not limited to patients in the terminal phase.
"This leaves the door open to a situation in which someone who is tired of living and is over 18 years old can ask for help to commit suicide," Deschamps said.
Mr Deschamps also points out that the authors of the report seem to prioritize personal autonomy over any other value of society.
Now, he adds, “in society, there are labels and limitations.”
Health law expert Margaret Somerville also expressed her “strong opposition” to the report’s findings, which she called a “manifesto in favor of euthanasia.”
Margaret Somerville, who also belongs to the Royal Society of Canada, puts on trial especially the lack of abuse in certain countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide are legal, such as in the Netherlands and Oregon.
King of Jordan urges President Assad to resign
Damascus Announces ‘Conspiracy’
Syria is increasingly isolated.
Assad’s partisans protested yesterday in front of the Foreign Ministry building.
Yesterday intensified diplomatic pressure on Syria by Bashar al-Assad who, with the support of Russia, resists it and denounces that there is a “complot” against the country.
Two days after the suspension of Syria by the Arab League, the European Union has tightened sanctions against Damascus, while Turkey and Jordan, neighbors to Syria, have manifested in favor of President Assad’s abandonment of power.
King Abdullah II of Jordan was the first Arab leader to ask President Bashar al-Assad to "abandon power" in Syria, where a quarter of civilians and members of the regime forces have already died.
"If Bachar really cares about his country, he should resign, in addition to creating the necessary conditions for a new phase of Syrian political life," the king of Jordan, a neighboring country to Syria, said in an interview with the BBC.
For his part, Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu regretted that Turkey’s mediation efforts since the beginning of the year with the Syrian regime have failed.
“Those who are not at peace in the Middle East with their peoples and cannot satisfy them will leave,” he said, referring to Syria, a neighbor with which Turkey is taking an increasingly tough stance.
For its part, following the decisions of the Arab League and the European Union, the United States has celebrated that "the consensus against Assad and the actions of the regime" in Syria has been strengthened.
“The international community, the United States, the EU, the Arab League and other countries, such as Turkey, are adopting an increasingly tough tone” regarding the repression in Syria, said Mark Toner, a State Department spokesman.
Meanwhile, 16 civilians and at least 19 members of the regime forces have been killed in the Deraa region in southern Syria, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (OSDH) said.
Two other civilians have died "during bombings and gunfire at Jobar" in the besieged city of Homs, the NGO said.
During a press conference, Syrian Foreign Minister Walid Al Mualem said the country is "going forward towards the end of the crisis."
In addition, he has reacted firmly to the Arab League’s decision to suspend Damascus from its duties, which in his opinion constitutes “a dangerous step.”
Syria "will not faint," he added, assuring that "the plots drafted against Syria will fail."
Following the decision to suspend Syria, the Arab League is currently studying a "mechanism for the protection of civilians" and wants to send 500 members of Arab human rights organizations, media and military observers to the country.
French Foreign Minister Alain Juppé has also expressed his support for sending U.N. observers to help protect civilians from the regime’s repression, which he considers to be “paranoid.”
A new extraordinary League meeting is scheduled to be held tomorrow in Rabat to finish the implementation of the crisis exit plan adopted on November 2 which includes, in particular, the withdrawal of the armed forces from the cities that are in the hands of the opposition and the release of the detained protesters.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov judged the Arab League's decision as "incorrect", while China urged Syria to implement the plan for the crisis, although it did not support the application of possible sanctions against Damascus.
Italy
Monti demands time for markets and sacrifices for Italians
The future head of the Italian government, Mario Monti, has asked the markets some time to train his team and launch a program that will include "sacrifices" aimed at recovering the credibility lost during the last months of Berlusconi's government.
The former European Commissioner debated yesterday with the political parties and today met with the unions and the employers.
It should form a relatively narrow cabinet, composed of technocrats outside Parliament.
"Monti has spoken of a broad program with numerous sacrifices," said Francesco Nucara, a member of one of the abundant small parliamentary groups that participated in the meetings, after meeting with the designated President of the Council.
The Speaker of the Chamber of Deputies, Gianfranco Fini, said he expects Mario Monti to request a vote of confidence before Friday to ensure that the new government has sufficient support.
The consultations will end with Mr Monti’s submission of a limited list of a dozen Ministers to the Head of State, Giorgio Napolitano.
Monti commented on the nervousness of the stock markets and the bonds yesterday, asking for time.
In "democracy, there are precise deadlines" for forming a government and preparing its program, he said, adding that he is "safe that the markets will have patience and understand it."
His appointment by the President initially benefited the markets, but then concerns were imposed, after an unexpected drop in industrial production in the euro area in September.
The appointed Prime Minister should create a team mainly made up of technocrats, even if he has highlighted that he would like to include “politicians.”
The new government will remain in office until the next legislative election, he said.
Speaker of the House of Representatives, Gianfranco Fini, said the new government will get the vote of confidence from Parliament before Friday.
Monti has pledged that, when he takes office, he will work taking into account the urgency and with the aim that Italy "recover its protagonism" in Europe.
A spokesman for European Commissioner Olli Rehn said that “even with a new government, our diagnosis of the Italian economy will not vary.”
The EU, convinced that Rome will not reach its goal of achieving a balanced budget in 2013, despite austerity plans adopted over the past few months, has called for further measures of rigor.
Italian chief Emma Marcegaglia, who will see the mates, also insisted on the need to boost the economy, "since a country that does not grow can not respect the requirements on deficit."
Monti, famous for his competence and independence as European Commissioner (1994-2004), represents a "change of time" for Italy after 17 years of "Berlusconism"; the "professor" symbolizes "the challenge of seriousness" and "other Italy", according to the publishers.
The biggest uncertainty is the longevity of the team.
President Napolitano wants to avoid early elections, as Italy has to place about 200 billion euros in government bonds before April 2012.
Russian scientist collaborates with Iranian nuclear program
A Russian scientist, Vycheslav Danilenko, has collaborated with Iran on the development of a detonator that can be used with a nuclear weapon, a U.S. non-governmental organization specializing in nuclear risk said on Monday.
For the investigator’s identification, the Institute of Science and International Security (ISIS) is based on a recent report from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and other documents issued by the UN agency.
The IAEA last week expressed its “serious concern” about a “possible military dimension” of Iran’s nuclear program.
According to ISIS, based extensively on IAEA documents, Danilenko, born in 1934, would have worked for three decades, since the 1960s, at a Soviet military nuclear facility in Chelyabinsk (Oural) and would have participated in the manufacture of synthetic diamonds by explosion.
In 1989 or 1991, he would have left the center to form a company focused on the production of "nanodiamonds" in Kiev.
The economic problems of his company would have led him to contact, in 1995, with the Iranian Embassy in Ukraine.
Afterwards, it is believed that he cooperated with the Iranian program between 1996 and 2002, before returning to Russia.
In its latest report, the IAEA mentions that there are "clear indications that Iran is developing" a nuclear detonation system "with the help of a foreign expert, who not only knew the technique well, but also, according to a member state informed the Agency, worked during the majority of its career on such technology in the military nuclear program of its country of origin."
Crimes and crimes against Muslims have increased by 50%
Crimes and crimes against Muslims have increased by 50 percent between 2009 and 2010, while, in the same period, the remaining types of racial and religious violence have decreased or increased only slightly, according to statistics released by the FBI on Monday.
According to these figures, the total number of acts of violence committed against Muslims has gone from 107 in 2009 to 160 in 2010, that is, it has increased by 49%, compared with a 13% rise in the case of acts of violence against Catholics, a 4% reduction in crimes against Jews and a 14% global increase in the number of crimes and anti-religious crimes.
The total number of “hate crimes” has grown slightly to 6,628 cases, of which 47.3% are due to racial differences and 20% to religious differences, according to the FBI.
“After a decline in 2009, it is worrying that these types of crimes and crimes have risen again,” Human Rights First said, adding that “the rise in acts of violence against Muslims is significant,” the organization said in a statement.
“Human Rights First has long pointed out that violence against Muslims, as well as all kinds of hate crimes, should be considered a serious violation of human rights,” adds a spokesman for the organization, Paul Legendre.
“The U.S. government can and should strive to put an end to such abuses,” he added, considering that such efforts could include improving police reports on “hate crimes.”
The "hate crime" in U.S. federal law was inherited from the era of civil rights struggle.
Such legislation was adopted after Martin Luther King’s death to punish acts of violence linked to race, skin color, religion, origin and, now, sexual inclination.
Twitter changes platform and looks more like Facebook
The microblogging site Twitter modified on Monday the presentation of its platform to allow its users, in particular, to observe the activity of the people they follow, which causes its service to resemble Facebook a little more.
A new “activity” tab and another so-called “name” tab allow you to follow more readily and live the activity of other “Twittos”, that is, those Internet users whose messages (“tweets”) follow on the Internet or who follow you.
This allows you to know if they track messages, if they subscribe to new accounts, if they qualify for a favourite message, etc.
This new Twitter formula was tested "with a small percentage of users in August" before spreading to the rest of the network on Monday, a Twitter spokeswoman, Carolyn Penner, told AFP.
Twitter, which was known for its little instinctive functioning, with slightly esoteric terms (RT to re-send a message from another person, followfriday pour recommander de suivre un autre utilisateur) faisant le bonheur des initiés, s'ouvre ainsi à un public plus large avec un maniement plus comparable à celui des réseaux grand public Facebook et Google+.
On the network, users have debated with different opinions the interest of this innovation.
“It’s useless, it’s invasive and it looks too much like Facebook,” she wrote @jemb123.
“The Activity feature will help me better follow some elements of my Twitter stream,” writes @dannykronstrom.
Austrian
Introduction of a "golden rule" budget in the Constitution
The government of the great social-democratic/Christian-democratic coalition that is in power in Austria has decided on Tuesday to include in the constitution a budgetary "golden rule" to reduce the public deficit and thus avoid a possible degradation of Austria's sovereign note by credit rating agencies (triple A).
It was the Social Democratic Chancellor himself, Werner Faymann, who announced this decision after a Council of Ministers, when the Austrian public debt reaches 74.6%, a figure very higher than the maximum limit of 60% fixed by the Maastricht Treaty, but clearly lower than the debts of countries such as Italy, Greece or Spain.
“If Austria’s solvency was reduced to a single level, from AAA to AA+, we would have to pay 3 billion euros more in interest each year,” said Vice-Chancer of Foreign Affairs Michael Spindelegger.
Austria thus responds to a request from the Brussels Summit to the member countries of the euro zone on 26 October: in it, the Heads of State and Government called for the inclusion, before the end of 2012, of the reduction of the public deficit and the recovery of the balance of the public accounts in the Constitution or in a law with equivalent value.
The device adopted by the Austrian government approaches the "German model", since Germany was the first European country to adopt this type of "rule".
Before 2017, the structural public deficit should decrease annually by 0.75% of gross domestic product (GDP) and, from 2017, the structural public deficit of the federal state should not exceed 0.35% of GDP annually, while regional states, as well as communes, should present balanced budgets.
The goal is that by 2020/2021 public debt will be reduced under the 60% criterion set by the Maastricht Treaty.
A strong yen
Noda threatens with new exchange market intervention
Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda warned on Tuesday that Japanese authorities would again intervene in the exchange mark if the yen continued to rise.
“We will intervene, as we did last time, if we see that there is excessive volatility” in the yen exchange rate, Noda told the Senate.
On Tuesday, the yen rose to levels close to the historic highs produced by the intervention of Japanese authorities on October 31.
That day, Tokyo massively sold yen for dollars to lower the value of the Japanese currency, which had just hit a new record since 1945 compared to the U.S. currency.
But the yen has been slowly rising since then, driven by purchases by investors who consider it a “refuge value” in these uncertain times of global economic slowdown and debt crisis in Europe.
The dollar was again quoted on Tuesday at less than 77 yen and the euro has dropped below the symbolic bar of 105 yen, reaching levels close to what the last intervention provoked.
Before the 2008-2009 financial crisis, the dollar was quoted at around 120 yen and the euro at more than 160 yen.
This explosion of the Japanese currency damages the exports of the archipelago, as it harms the products made in Japan and reduces the value of the incomes obtained abroad by Japanese companies when they convert them into the national currency.
“Japan is struggling to rebuild itself” after the March 11 earthquake and tsunami that devastated the region of Tohoku (northeast), Noda said, fearing that the worsening of the yen will cut off the weak recovery.
The third world economy has recovered in growth in the third quarter (1.5% compared to the previous quarter), for the first time in a year, thanks to an increase in exports and consumption of households affected by the disaster.
But the Prime Minister believes that the elevated level of the yen did not reflect the “economic bases of Japan.”
Finance Minister Jun Azumi has asked the Bank of Japan (BoJ), which opened a two-day meeting on Tuesday of its Monetary Policy Council, to take all possible measures to weaken the yen.
However, the institution’s Deputy Governor, Hirohide Yamaguchi, warned that the BoJ had already taken “the appropriate measures,” suggesting that no greater monetary flexibility should be expected on Wednesday.
During its last meeting in late October, the institution increased its purchases of Treasury Letters by five trillion yen (47 billion euros), bringing to 55 trillion yen (519 billion euros) the threshold of funds it devotes to the acquisition of various financial bonds to flood the liquidity market.
The Eurozone:
The stocks grow, the stock markets decline
The risk of contagion from the debt crisis continues to hurt European indices.
Despite the appointment of new heads of government in Greece and Italy, as well as better growth figures in France and Germany, interest rates in the weaker countries continue to rise.
Still concerned about the stability of the euro area, European stock markets sink a little further into the negative zone on Tuesday, November 15.
In Paris, at 10 a.m., the CAC 40 loses 1.4% and stands at 3.064 points.
The Dax loses 0.4% in Frankfurt and 0.1% in London.
"Given the new tensions in relation to the lending yields of the euro area countries most affected, stock markets around the world continue to yield part of their recent gains."
“Investors, nervous, are perfectly aware of the risk of contagion,” said Terry Pratt, an institutional broker at IG Markets.
The Tokyo Stock Exchange closed with a 0.7 percent drop, renewing market interventionists’ concerns about Europe’s ability to contain the debt crisis.
“Japan, like the rest of the world, has a fixed eye on Europe and exchanges will continue to take place at a margin of reduced variation, so investors will have no evidence that the situation has stabilized,” said Mitsushige Akino, fund manager at Ichiyoshi Investment Management.
The re-emergence of concerns about the future of the euro zone affects the single currency, which continues to fall on Tuesday.
The euro remains at its lowest level in a month and a half.
At 10 a.m., the European currency was worth $1,3570, a 0.4% drop.
It has lost its value after Chancellor Angela Merkel’s party, the CDU, which met in Congress on Monday, adopted a motion that envisages, in particular, the option that a country in difficulty should leave the euro zone without leaving the European Union.
Italian and Spanish rates rise by more than 6%
Credit rates in Italy and Spain remain at a very worrying level.
On Tuesday morning, the yield of Italian 10-year bonds reached 6.85%, while Spanish bonds at the same time offered 6.2%.
These tensions in relation to interest rates in the southern countries, although also in France, continue to fuel the fears of the interventors.
The head of the future Italian government, Mario Monti, has asked the markets for time to improve the situation in Italy, which risks suffocating with the weight of its debt.
The new Greek Prime Minister, Lucas Papademos, on his part, has said that the implementation of the decisions adopted at the euro zone summit on October 27 would be the "main job" of his government.
Spain is in the spotlight of the markets, while the legislative elections will be held there on Sunday.
The difference in rates (“spread”) between 10-year obligations in Germany and Spain has reached a new historic high.
Expecting growth figures in the euro area
From the statistical point of view, France has registered an economic growth of 0.4% in the third quarter, that is, a figure more favorable than the 0.3% expected, driven by domestic consumption.
The Insee, however, has revised down the second quarter figure, with a 0.1% reduction in gross domestic product (GDP) rather than a stagnation.
Furthermore, the fourth quarter is the one that really concerns economists.
Germany, for its part, has registered a 0.5% growth in the same period.
The first forecast for the eurozone as a whole is scheduled for 11 a.m., after the European Commission has warned about the risk of a new recession.
The Energy Policy:
Facts are more important than dogmas.
If there is one topic that can’t be addressed considering short-term considerations or simply thinking about emotions, it’s energy policy.
The availability and cost of electricity directly influence the purchasing power and competitiveness of.
It is appropriate that an election meeting is the time to reflect on such issues and on the place of nuclear energy.
The debate will only be useful if it examines the overall economic, social and environmental consequences of the proposed options.
The French should base their opinion on objective facts, on rational data.
Now that we are 7 billion people on the planet, the demographic evolution will mean the doubling of electricity demand before 2050, unless a huge portion of the world’s population is deprived of a vital element.
At the same time, the increasing shortage of fossil resources will have to be reduced to continue to produce electricity continuously, without forgetting the imperative need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to fight climate change, a topic that has disappeared from the ecological debate.
The Fukushima accident does not change any of these parameters.
Therefore, Germany remains alone in its decision to give up nuclear energy.
This is not the case for Belgium, which submits its power to the need to find a source capable of replacing it, nor for Switzerland, which aims only to build state-of-the-art power plants.
On the other hand, Britain, Finland, Poland, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Sweden, South Africa, China, India and Brazil, to name a few examples, are determined to move forward with their projects.
The United States, on the other hand, after Fukushima decided to add a unit to its park, resuming the construction of a power plant interrupted after the Three Mile Island accident.
If the German model, based on renewable energy, is occasionally presented as an example, reality goes against such a discourse.
The Berlin election will result in an increase in electricity prices, increased energy dependence on increased imported gas, from Russia, and an increase in CO2 emissions from the construction of gas and coal plants.
In a few months, the adverse effects will be noticed.
You should think about the case of Denmark.
Champion of Europe in the wind sector, from which he obtains 30% of his electricity, he is also one of the major users of coal and gas due to the intermittent wind; for this reason, his CO2 emissions and the price of his electricity are, respectively, 65% and 50% higher than the European average.
On the contrary, thanks to the consistency of our energy policy, our neighbors pay a 40% higher electricity bill than that of French households.
While in a globalized economy the cost of energy constitutes a key factor of competitiveness and a guarantee of the maintenance of industrial utility on the national territory, French companies benefit from the cheapest electricity in Europe.
For that reason, any significant reduction in nuclear energy would mean a sharp rise in the price of electricity, which would restrain realism to the wonderful statements about the reindustrialization of our country and the defense of our purchasing power.
This is a price that the vast majority of French refuse to pay and, in fact, do not oppose this type of energy in principle, according to surveys.
Remember that the energy policy of our country has lost to build an industrial sector with 125,000 director jobs and 410,000 indirect jobs.
Widespreadly export-oriented, it encompasses a galaxy of SMEs specializing in international markets that can create unrelocalizable jobs.
If France decided to abandon nuclear energy, it would mean the sacrifice of much of those SMEs and the loss of the 6 billion euros annually in French exports of nuclear equipment and services.
What electrician would order an EPR designed to run for sixty years, when its manufacturer’s collapse is planned?
To solve the equation of nuclear energy, we must admit that there is no miraculous source of electricity production, just as there is no diabolical source.
Areva’s development of low-carbon, nuclear and renewable solutions demonstrates the complementarity of energy sources.
In the case of nuclear energy, it is essential to maintain the highest level of safety.
In France, we have a security authority that exercises strict and transparent control over both the existing power plants and the construction of Flamanville.
Our team, of recognized professionalism, are also obsessed with safety.
In half a century, the nuclear sector has suffered three serious accidents.
Only one, Three Mile Island, occurred under normal operating conditions; it did not cause consequences for people or the environment.
In Chernobyl, the accident was due to the design of the reactor and unforgivable human failures.
In Fukushima, some people seem to forget that the accident was due to two natural disasters of unprecedented scale, which caused the deaths of tens of thousands of people.
The nuclear sector will learn from this accident, as it did from the previous two.
Thanks to these advances and cooperation between security authorities, French and German operators and manufacturers, the EPR presents a design capable of resisting such phenomena.
While it is studied by all electric actors who want to build a power plant, the interruption of its construction in Flamanville would be a great gift for the competitors of Areva and EDF, since it would leave them free way to take the lead in the inevitable development of the nuclear sector.
It is indispensable and legitimate to seek the best energy options for our country, but it would be irresponsible to let the emotion, dogmas and partisan manoeuvres dominate such an important debate for the economic, social and financial situation of our country.
Immigration, a burden or an opportunity for the economy?
The immigration policy applied by Nicolas Sarkozy has been criticized from various points of view: the saturation of the police, judicial and administrative services subjected to the policy of numbers, the compatibility of this policy with France’s self-proclaimed status of “country of human rights”.
More recently, it is the administrative harassment of foreign students that has jumped to the headlines, with the Interior Minister (see the 23 May newspaper Libération) proclaiming in the past that France “needs no foreign talents, workers or waiters.”
However, it is rarely analyzed from an economic point of view.
There is a consensus between the left and the right on this issue.
In the case of the right, Jacques Chirac fixed the orientation declaring in 1976 that "900,000 unemployed should not be a problem for a country that has close to two million immigrant workers", while on the left, the tone was fixed by Michel Rocard explaining that France "cannot take care of all the misery of the world" in 1990.
The difference is the degree of generosity.
In 2005, both the left and the right shared the fear of the invasion of the national territory by a multitude of Polish fontaners.
On both sides, it is considered that immigrants are a burden for the French economy and society.
The only difference is in the degree of generosity with which they act with respect to immigrants.
In his program, François Hollande limits himself to include banality, indicating that co-development will allow solving the "migration problem".
This idea of immigration as a burden, a problem, is profitable electorally, but economically very expensive.
As economists Ian Goldin and Geoffrey Cameron point out in a recent work summarizing the most recent knowledge on immigration (Exceptional People: How Migration Shaped Our World and Will Define Our Future, May 2011, Princeton University Press, 352 pp.), there is a broad consensus among experts on the positive impact of migration flows on economic growth, wages and employment in the countries that receive immigrants.
Limiting immigration weakens growth and undermines employment.
Fears related to the impact of immigrants are based on the idea that they can replace domestic workers, low-skilled workers, by pressuring for their wages to be reduced.
But experience shows that, in reality, immigrants are more complementary than substitutes of domestic workers and mainly exercise professions in sectors with lack of employment.
Low-skilled immigrants work in sectors that do not attract domestic workers and the most skilled in dynamic sectors where training does not meet the demand for personnel.
Positive effects on wages
Just as a surgeon would have difficulty working in a country that lacks anesthesiologists, the complementarity between nationals and immigrants causes the arrival of the latter to positively influence the salaries and employment of nationals.
Taking into account the foregoing, Giovanni Peri calculated that an increase of 1% in migration flows implies a rise in long-term real wages of between 0.6 and 0.9%.
And, without taking into account the fact that the diversity that immigrants bring contributes to the creation of ideas and economic growth (there is a large proportion of naturalized American Nobel prizes and companies like Google, Intel, Paypal, eBay and Yahoo were founded by immigrants).
Immigrants are also net contributors to social systems, as they contribute an average of 1% of the total budget in the European countries.
The International Labour Organization calculates, for example, that in Germany an immigrant who arrives at the age of 30 will make a net contribution (income minus expenses) of 150,000 euros to the public budgets on average throughout his life.
At the beginning of his term, Nicolas Sarkozy wanted to go and look for the growth points he lacked "with his teeth."
Those teeth, which discouraged immigrants, had exactly the opposite effect.
Europe invented democracy, it only needs to think of a European democracy
Democracy is a precious good, but it is also fragile.
The European continent should be able to remember this because, although it was invented in Athens more than two thousand years ago, throughout the twentieth century it has suffered the tragedies of the World War, totalitarianisms, the Holocaust, the gulag, but also Franco in Spain, Salazar in Portugal, the coronels in Greece.
Some may have believed that, in order for democracy to finally triumph over its enemies, it would be enough to exercise the vote and as directly as possible.
We know, from Napoleon "the Little", that it was something thought out.
Universal suffrage, although it is a necessary condition for democracy, is not sufficient by itself and can even become a “instrument of oppression,” as Republican philosopher Etienne Vacherot once said.
No, democracy requires much more: a public space, a public spirit, values, an organization, a separation and control of powers, an education, Lights, economic and social solidarity, justice.
The crisis we are experiencing in Europe is an economic crisis, but it is about to become a political and democratic crisis.
The palinody of the true-false Greek referendum had, in this regard, a double revealing effect: it showed the need for a powerful return of the political sphere, but also the worrying feeling of its impossibility, of its incongruity.
This ambivalence has to be overcome.
The truth is that the front lines of the democratic battle have currently shifted and that, in many cases, Republican soldiers are no longer moving in the right direction.
We will not win if we demand a succession of national referendums, organized according to needs and disorderly.
A blank signature to the absolute European monarch or an end to the nationalist hole: what options for the citizen!
No, we do not want to strike out effects, but a common, full-right, quiet and continuous exercise of choices and democracy, this time at the European level.
There is no crisis in Greece, Italy, Spain, Portugal (in fact, we’t know where the list would end), because there is only one crisis, the crisis of Europe.
It is the whole of Europe that plugs to the orders of the markets and of the rating agencies that suffers from its powerlessness and lack of solidarity.
It is the whole of Europe that suffers a humiliation in the international sphere.
We are concerned about the transfer of sovereignty to Europe, but it is all of Europe that is slowly losing sovereignty and, with it, each of its nations.
The most urgent thing is that the popular sovereignty regains the stepping stone of the European project.
Because only together will Europeans be able to reduce the burden of their debt, free themselves from the markets and prepare their future through investments.
The exit from the crisis will require decisions at European level that cannot be taken without full democratic legitimacy, unless it is to lead us to disaster.
Having struggled for a long time against this proposal by the Socialists and Jacques Delors, everyone is now calling for European economic governance.
Let it be so.
But thinking of it without greater political and democratic integration, and without it being lived as such by citizens, would be a new madness and would take us to a new dead spot.
We must take on a new stage of European construction.
To build the Republic in France, it was necessary to “make” Republicans.
Revolution motivated by interests would not be enough.
This lesson is still applicable.
We need to build a more economically integrated Europe.
It can only be achieved by building a more democratic Europe on the political level, a true European popular sovereignty.
To build Europe, let us become Europeans.
“Contactless” chip cards are becoming widespread
The world chip card show starts on Tuesday in Villepinte, near Paris, with an optimistic atmosphere.
In fact, the year 2011 should end with an 11% increase in worldwide sales of microprocessor cards (banking cards, SIM phones, etc.), with a total of 6 billion units, according to calculations from the cabinet Eurosmart.
The most powerful segment is the contactless technology, which allows you to pay for public transportation or shopping simply by bringing the card closer to a reader.
This year, 460 million contactless chip cards will be sold worldwide, 320 million more than the previous year!
Its share should continue to increase in 2012 (580 million units are expected) and account for about 10% of the global chip card market (6,925 million cards).
Europe, which has long lagged behind the Asia-Pacific region, is gaining ground in the contactless payment sector.
Approximately 26 million Visa bank cards already have this feature, which is accepted in 75,000 payment terminals.
In France, their beginnings are more modest: 400,000 contactless Visa cards are being used.
But the large surfaces work for four.
Carrefour has issued 2.5 million contactless MasterCard Pass cards this year.
However, in order to get the upper march, it is necessary for banks to make them available to their customers.
“There are two major French establishments that have committed to systematically spreading contactless bank cards among their customers in the future,” said Gérard Nébouy, managing director of Visa Europe France.
Banks are testing mobile payments
But it is only a first step toward the means of payment of the future: the mobile phone.
Currently, there are few devices equipped with Near Field Communication (NFC) technology, indispensable for transactions.
“They are delaying.”
“But I should finally experience a real boom next year.”
“We predict that between 80 and 120 million units will be sold worldwide in 2012,” explains Marc Bertin, president of Eurosmart.
The banks are taking the lead.
Crédit agricole announced yesterday the launch of a test between December and next June in Caen.
Approximately 200 customers and collaborators’ iPhones will be equipped with a foil that allows contactless payment.
The BPCE has a similar project in Strasbourg and Marseille.
And the Société générale also stated yesterday that it is preparing the commercialization of an offer that allows its customers to pay contactlessly through their mobile.
From the Sahara to Nigeria, the terrorist front increases
Paris is concerned about the links between Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb and Boko Haram.
The links between the terrorist group Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (Aqmi) and the Nigerian sect of Boko Haram, suspected for a long time, have been confirmed.
On Sunday, Algeria’s Deputy Foreign Minister, Abdelkader Messahel, even claimed that Algeria already “has the certainty.”
“The way the two organizations operate and the reports from the intelligence services show that they are cooperating,” he explained, without providing further details.
Paris seems to come to a similar conclusion.
The investigation into the kidnapping of two French citizens in Niger last January would have resumed the passageways.
Kidnapped in a Niamey restaurant by people related to Aqmi, Antoine de Léocour and Vincent Delory died the next day along with several of their hijackers during an operation launched by the French special forces.
In the debris of the intervention, French and Nigerian investigators discovered several phone chips that belonged to the terrorists.
The terrorist
The study of the calls made points to several interlocutors based in Mali, Niger and Nigeria.
According to Radio France Internationale (RFI), two numbers captured especially the interest of the investigators: one leads to a Nigerian who remained for a long time in Maiduguri, a northern Nigerian city, the birthplace of Boko Haram, and the other to a man who is allegedly close to Aqmi and the sect.
“This is a progress, but we must definitely wait for more formal evidence before we talk about operational cooperation between Aqmi and Boko Haram.”
“But it is possible.”
“We have known for years that the sect enjoys external financial and intellectual support and is increasingly active,” said Kunle Amuwo, a Nigerian researcher.
In recent months, such “support” has become increasingly evident in the evolution and speeches of Boko Haram or its operational modes, which now involve the use of suicide bombs or explosive devices increasingly complex and of the same style as those used by Aqmi.
The international community, starting with Washington, has since pressured Abuya to take into account the problems generated by Boko Haram.
Nigerian authorities, in fact, have long regarded the group as a community of enlightened people unworthy of interest.
A quick success
Founded in 2002 in Maiduguri around a mosque, a school and the fundamentalist imam Mohammed Yusuf, Boko Haram (which means, in hausa, "Western education is a sin"), encourages the establishment of an Islamic emirate in the Muslim north of Nigeria.
In this poor region, the partnership is experiencing rapid success.
It politizes and demands a strict respect for Sharia, while its militants fight against the wicked central government.
The latter are primarily oriented to churches, bars, administrations.
In 2009, Boko Haram militants were especially active and attacks on police offices multiplied.
Abuya’s reaction was, as usual, widespread.
The army attacked the city and 800 people were killed.
Mohammed Yusuf, arrested in life, receives death in prison.
Since then, the sect has radicalized and abandoned its northern feuds.
Last Christmas, it claimed an attack that killed 80 people in Jos and then another in Abuya.
In June, Boko Haram again attacked Abuya, in particular the protected police headquarters, with a suicide attack, the first of its kind.
In August, the United Nations local headquarters became its first international target.
The creation of a terrorist axis in Africa, which would extend from Mauritania to Somalia through Nigeria, disturbs all security experts.
While Aqmi has attacked Mali and Niger and the Somali al-Chebab operate in Kenya, Boko Haram emerges as a new threat in the center of the continent.
Last week, during a meeting in Nigeria with President Goodluck Jonathan, Alain Juppé warned him against Boko Haram and said he was willing to "share all the information".
The world according to Republican presidential candidates
In relation to China, with Iran and with the help to Israel, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, and Rick Perry rival in simplicity and lack of knowledge.
Can an America weakened by the crisis manage a complex world with simple or even simplistic ideas?
Listening to the Republican candidates for the presidential elections, voters might think that is so.
For a few days, Mitt Romney, Herman Cain, Rick Perry and the other candidates have been making more and more loud statements and shortcuts on foreign policy, traditionally a strong spot for Republicans.
Slogans are spread, often unfounded, about China, Iran, aid to Israel.
Mitt Romney, the best-placed candidate in the race to the designation for the "Grand Old Party", has threatened to take the Chinese before the WTO and denounce them "for manipulation of their currency", a key issue in an America exasperated by the migration of entire fragments of its sector to Asia.
It doesn’t matter if that implies the explosion of a trade war, he said.
Jon Huntsman, Obama’s former ambassador to China and the only candidate who possesses a sophisticated view of foreign policy, almost drowns in an attitude that “blows” emotions.
He called for a firm but constructive dialogue with Beijing (Obama’s current position).
But Huntsman, who is stuck in the depths of the polls, remains inaudible.
The style of Reagan
Romney has also promised military intervention in Iran if sanctions fail to disrupt his nuclear program.
“If I get elected, I’ll stop Iran,” he said.
“If Obama gets re-elected, they’ll have the bomb.”
He also promised to increase military aid to Israel, accusing Obama of failing to meet his obligations with that partner.
Businessman Herman Cain, the second best-ranked candidate, shows shameful ignorance of such topics.
Recently, he urged to counter China’s military threat because Beijing “tries to develop nuclear capabilities”, apparently ignoring the fact that China already has the military atom since 1964.
Tehran Governor Rick Perry, who supports Israel and wants to intervene in Iran, says he is willing to deploy the U.S. military in Mexico to fight the drug cartels.
The use of torture against alleged terrorists, banned by Obama in 2009, is also advocated by Cain, Perry and candidate Michele Bachmann.
The differences are considerable with the 2008 Republican candidate John McCain, a heavy weight in foreign policy.
Opponents of the current President argue that Reagan also had simple ideas and that he won the Cold War.
They remember that Obama himself was a fan and that he had to loosen the piston in the fight against terrorism.
They rightly insist on the failure of their naive dialogue with Iran, on the hasty departure of the “boys” from Iraq and on their disturbances in Libya, and label it as weak.
But the attacks are not easy.
The population judges in a rather positive way Obama’s national security balance sheet, which killed Bin Laden.
From Iraq, it suspects military interventions that generate a collapse.
And, arguing that it is necessary to rebuild America economically to revive its leadership, Obama gives the impression of being more just.
Nord Stream, the new gateway for Russian gas to Europe
The Nord Stream gas pipeline, which directly connects Western Europe with Russia through the bottom of the Baltic Sea, has already been put into service.
It must supply gas to meet the needs of thirty million households.
Gazprom, the Russian gas giant, has wanted to celebrate the event with great pomp.
On Tuesday, more than 500 guests, including four heads of state and government, participated on the shores of the Baltic Sea, between the music of the orchestra and a delicate buffet, in the inauguration of the Nord Stream, the new gas pipeline that directly communicates, under the sea, Russia with Germany.
Symbolically, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, French Prime Minister François Fillon and his Dutch counterpart Mark Rutte have turned together the wheel of the valve that controls the entry of Russian gas into the western European network.
With this new pipeline, an additional 27.5 million cubic meters of Russian gas will be delivered to Western Europe each year through a first 1.224-kilometer pipeline connecting the St. Petersburg region with the Land of Mecklenburg-Pomerania.
A second pipeline should be completed by the end of 2012 that will allow for a total supply of 55,000 billion cubic meters of gas, that is enough to cover all French consumption.
In addition, it is already being talked about the possibility of building a third tube on the same route.
For Gazprom, the timely completion of this huge project presents airs of victory.
Poland and the Baltic countries had strongly opposed the project.
In fact, the Nord Stream will allow gas to be supplied directly to Germany, avoiding land flow through third countries (Poland and Ukraine).
All of a sudden, these two countries lose some of their power: for them, it will be harder to influence Russia by threatening to close its access to Western European markets.
At the height of the debate, Warsaw did not hesitate to compare the Nord Stream as a "new German-Soviet pact", in reference to the alliance between Hitler and Stalin to occupy Poland in 1939.
That is, if the issue is politically sensitive.
Western Europe, supporting the Russian project, has gained greater security of supply.
But the price is a weakening of Europe’s energy, given that the project has created a gap between Eastern and Western Europeans.
In just five years, Russia has succeeded in making its vision of a direct alliance between Russia and the wealthy Western countries, large gas consumers and with increasingly limited reserves.
"This pipeline constitutes a component of our partnership with Russia, a new artery that unites us organically," Fillon said at the pipeline's inauguration, demonstrating to what extent the major contracts in the gas sector are both political and economic.
All this explains the wide smiles on the faces of the Gazprom executives, numerous in Lubmin, at the point of arrival of gas.
The construction of this pipeline is also a technical achievement.
The submarine pipe is made of cement-coated steel to protect it from the anchors of ships.
It rests on the bottom of the sea, at an average of 200 meters of depth.
To build it, it was necessary to avoid mine fields dating from World War II.
“It was necessary to remove or destroy a hundred of them, for caution,” said Jens Müller, spokesman for Nord Stream.
Furthermore, measures for the protection of flora and fauna have been taken.
The tube is a long metal snake that weighs as much as 242 Eiffel towers and is not interrupted in all its length: neither by valves, nor by maintenance stations.
A control platform was planned in Sweden’s waters, but the project managers abandoned it because the Swedes were not very willing to allow a Russian state company to establish itself permanently in the sea off its coast.
"In the event of a breakdown, we will interrupt the passage of gas in less than a minute," said Müller.
In the event of a leak, the gas from the pipeline will thus be released into the atmosphere.
But the constructors consider it unlikely that a leak will occur, since they have predicted joints that, according to forecasts, will have a leak every 100,000 years.
Control of the state of the pipeline is ensured by a submarine robot, dragged by a ship, which carries out external inspections, as well as by a device that circulates inside the pipeline.
In the form of a pure, it is introduced into the inside of the tube, which has a diameter of one meter, and moves with the gas.
Upon arrival, after three full days of travel at a speed of three meters per second, it provides accurate data on possible deformations of the metal.
The pipeline has been designed to operate for fifty years without any repair.
The circulation of gas is guaranteed simply by pressure.
At first it is 200 bars and at the output it is 100 bars.
Five companies have joined forces to carry out this project.
The leading company is Gazprom, which owns 51% of the shares.
It was joined by the German E.ON and BASF (15,5% each), as well as the Dutch Gasunie and the French group GDF Suez (9% each).
These five companies have created a joint company, called Nord Stream, to build and operate the pipeline.
It is headquartered in Zoug, Switzerland, where taxation is favorable.
Gazprom subsequently leased the entire gas transmission capacity to Gazprom for a renewable period of twenty-five years.
“Gazprom will pay you for the total capacity, regardless of the amount of gas that is actually transported,” says Müller.
The financing of the construction of the gas pipeline has been completed by 30% with the contribution of the shareholders and by 70% through bank loans.
The total cost of the work should reach 7.4 billion euros for the two pipes.
For GDF Suez, for example, the investment has reached 240 million.
But minority shareholders are confident that they will not exceed their investment, since Gazprom assumes the risk of the expenses alone.
The pipeline emerges from the Baltic at Lubmin, on a sandy coast planted with pines.
Valves, with a height of 4.5 meters, form the gas exit gate.
There are sensors that measure the pressure, temperature and specific characteristics of the gas on arrival, before it is transferred to German pipelines.
Since last Tuesday, the terminal receives one million cubic meters of Russian gas every hour.
At total capacity, it will be three million per hour and in 2012, six million.
Moleskine is a brand booklet.
Created half a century ago by an Italian company, Moleskine wants to return people to the taste for writing.
It has an air of adventure, hours of writing in the light of a candle.
The Moleskine booklet is easily recognized, with its black rectangular pastes, its rubber, its broken white leaves, as aged by time.
However, the Moleskine booklets with the current look were born... in 1997.
The Italian company Modo Modo, based in Milan, decided at the time to launch a design but distinguished notebook booklet.
Maria Sebregondi, then a consultant for the company, was responsible for the launch of the new product.
The libretto is inspired by an ancient production technique, the mole skin, which refers to a cotton blanket that was used, among other things, to cover the banquets.
This type of booklet was highly valued by writers and travelers.
“Moleskine has adapted to the current taste an old and forgotten object, an icon of the avant-garde artists until the twentieth century,” says Maria Sebregondi, who has since become responsible for the brand in Mode Mode.
And he achieved success.
Between 2006 and 2010, sales increased by 26%, reaching a volume of 12.7 million units sold.
Far away has been the confidential production of the first years, in which only 3,000 booklets were designed.
Moleskine goes beyond the Italian borders and exports its products to 70 countries, from France to the United States.
It is difficult to determine the buyer’s profile, as the notebook attracts both businessmen, students and professionals.
Like Moleskine, its users are cosmopolitan, open-minded and cult.
The small Italian company, which had twelve employees at its inception, now owns about 100 and, since 2008, has two offices: one in Milan and the other in New York.
He distributes his books in bookstores, from the Fnac to the small shops of the city centre, and has been able to impose his identity.
“We have adapted to the times and the need to write, despite the rise of emails,” says Maria Sebregondi.
This cultural signature goes hand in hand with the development of Moleskine: recently, the brand has launched the exhibition "Detour" where architects or artists exhibit their own notebook.
In August, he also released a notebook with leopard tapes, on the occasion of the Locarno Film Festival.
Taking advantage of its success and this cultural aura, Moleskine has diversified its products: bags, tabs, pens, computer headsets... The brand covers a wide range of supports.
In the fall of 2006, Modo Modo was acquired by the investment fund SG Capital Europe, now Syntegra Capital, thus writing a new page in Moleskine’s history.
Why is the unemployment rate of disabled workers still so high?
About 19% of people with disabilities are looking for a job.
The 15th Week of Employment for Disabled People begins today.
Despite a resolved public policy, applied since 2005, the unemployment rate among disabled people doubles the average rate: 19%, compared to 9% for the whole population.
and discouraging?
“No,” says Éric Blanchet, general manager of Adapt, the association that organizes the week for disabled employment.
“The progress achieved over the past 15 years is considerable.
At that time, the unemployment rate was not twice but three times higher than the average.
“H, there is still a lot to do.”
Unemployed people with disabilities still face numerous obstacles to access employment.
They tend to have a more advanced age: 37% are over 50 years old (an average of 17%).
They have a low level of qualification: 80% have not finished their bachelor’s degree and, of the 2.3 million students in higher education, only 10,000 are disabled.
Lastly, long-term unemployment is very widespread among them: 53% for disabled people, compared to 38% on average.
That is, there are numerous issues that especially hinder the return to the world of work and that “constitute the quid of the problem,” says Christian Grapin, general director of Tremplin, an association created in 1992 to help companies hire disabled workers.
These are the objective obstacles.
In addition, there are those that are not mentioned; people’s mentality advances, but too slowly.
A study conducted in April by the IMS-Entreprendre association for the Cité noted that surveyed directors have “a low level of knowledge about disabilities,” with an “excessive representation of people in wheelchairs, physical or intellectual disabilities.”
The result: private companies with more than 20 employees are far from the target of hiring 6% of disabled workers, a goal that was set in a law of ... 1987.
According to the latest available figures, which date from 2008, they reach a ratio of 2.6%.
“Now we reach around 3%,” said Pierre Blanc, general manager of Agefiph, the agency responsible for collecting contributions from companies that do not respect this law.
The evidence: the number of establishments “submitted to this contribution”, as well as the amounts paid out, have decreased between 2007 and 2011, from 59,000 to 46,000 structures (and from 606 to 480 million euros).
“The 2005 law, which increased contributions, has generated a lot of pressure on companies,” explains Pierre Blanc.
“But this improvement also reflects real awareness, among large groups.”
According to the Ministry of Labour, only 59% of companies with between 20 and 49 employees have disabled employees in their staff, compared to 82% of companies with between 100 and 199 employees.
Hazard: “It is a joy”
About to face the Bleus on Tuesday night (20:45), Eden Hazard and Georges Leekens do not hide the pleasure generated by this friendly match.
We will not dare to say that there was connivence between them, but the image is symbolic.
Sitting side by side in the auditorium of the Stade de France, Georges Leekens and Eden Hazard have really made the peace.
Five months after his forward’s gesture of resentment against Turkey, the Belgian coach has nothing but praise for him.
“I was very happy for Eden, for her progress and because she’s Belgian.”
“I want to move forward,” the frontman of Lille replies.
As for the contrast between his presentations in his team and in the selection, “it’s a set,” he has justified.
“I’m in Lille all year round, which doesn’t apply to Belgium.
“I have to sit.”
Called to play against Romania on Friday night, considering this match against France, Hazard comes to Saint-Denis to finally "shine."
Don’t forget about “pleasure.”
He has been encouraging the Bleus since he was seven, as well as during the victorious campaigns of 1998 and 2000.
“I’ve always been a fan of him,” he says.
This will reinforce the “particular” character of the meeting.
Especially because he will face “Mathieu (Debuchy), Yohan (Cabaye) and Adil (Rami),” he remembers.
“We just met recently.
“Playing against them is always a joy.”
With simplicity, Leekens has made for his part reference to "pride".
“Pride” for a “Gala Game”
"Pride" also for checking, as a "neighbor", that France "returns to be a team of very high level", about a year after Knysna's trauma.
“Laurent Blanc has done a formidable job,” he said enthusiastically.
While Belgium will not attend the next European competition, the coach would be delighted to be able to share a plane with the Bleus to... Brazil, in 2014.
“Our little Belgians are growing up,” he said.
“We’re building something; the players are ambitious, they’re hungry.
“You can see it in the next matches,” including the match against France.
Portugal has great confidence.
Paulo Bento’s Portugal faces with great optimism the return match against Bosnia (22h00), which will be held on Tuesday in Lisbon.
In the match, both teams lacked realism.
“When these 90 minutes pass, we will be a happy team and, above all, a happy country.”
Paulo Bento is already seen in Poland and Ukraine.
There is no doubt; the Selecçao, which has been running since September 2010, will qualify for the Euro 2012.
In fact, only 90 minutes separate Portugal from happiness.
But there is a game to play and a rival, Bosnia, to defeat.
Given the go match (0-0), Friday in Zenica’s hell, it seems obvious that the matter is not decided.
Portugal dominated the game for more than an hour, yes, but he could not score the valuable goal that had given him the tranquility.
"It's a good result, but at the same time it brings with it a risk, since we haven't scored outside the home."
But at home, at the luminous Stadium de la Luz in Lisbon, the Portuguese are convinced that they will pass, in front of a public that should be equally enthusiastic, even if it is obvious that the match “is very equal,” said an optimistic but lucid Benedict.
“We hope the match will be very equal, but we are completely convinced that we can take the lead,” said the 42-year-old Portuguese coach.
"We continue to have a 50% chance of participating in the 2012 Euro", has, however, relativized the successor of Carlos Queiroz.
The match in Bosnia on Friday forces the Portuguese to score and win.
The Bosnians could get a draw, but they also need to score.
"It's a good result, but at the same time it brings with it a risk, since we haven't scored out of home," Bento regrets.
“We are going to play against a team that has a great technical quality and has players with a great individual quality,” he added.
As in Zenica, the Portuguese will go with the intention of exercising, from the beginning, a maximum pressure on the Bosnians to “do not leave them time to think.”
It’s a good idea, but this time it’s realistic.
