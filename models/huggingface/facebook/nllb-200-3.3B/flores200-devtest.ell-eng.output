This not only confirms that at least some of the dinosaurs had feathers, a theory already widely held, but also provides details that fossils generally cannot provide, such as their color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Researchers say that the wings of this animal were brown on top with a light or carotenoid color on the underside.
The find also provides information on the evolution of bird wing.
Because dinosaur wings lack a fully developed axis, called a spine, but have other features of wings - such as whiskers and tails - the researchers concluded that the spine was likely a later evolutionary development than the other features.
The structure of the wings suggests that they were not used for flight but for temperature control or display, and scientists argue that although this is a tail from a juvenile dinosaur, the specimen shows adult plumage rather than juvenile feathers.
Researchers say that although this is the tail of a juvenile dinosaur, the specimen suggests adult rather than juvenile plumage.
A car bomb exploded at the police headquarters in Gaziantep, Turkey yesterday morning, killing two police officers and injuring more than twenty people.

The luminosity and rotation are calculated together to define the Rosby number of a star, which relates to the flow of the plasma.
The star is as inactive with respect to magnetic reversals, the smaller the Rosby number.

The part of the project that was completed was primarily theoretical, however the program was designed to reproduce observations of the Sagittarius galaxy.
What the team expected would be caused by tidal forces between the galaxy's dark matter and the Milky Way's counterpart.
Just as the moon exerts a pull on the earth, creating tides, so Milky Way exerts a pull on the Sagittarius Galaxy.
Scientists have been able to conclude that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way as normal matter.
This theory holds that most of the dark matter found in a galaxy is located around the galaxy, forming a kind of corona, and is made up of many small particles.

In France, elections have always been a low-tech experience: voters are isolated in a curtain and put in an envelope a pre-printed piece of paper that says the candidate of their choice.
After the officials verify the identity of the voter, he throws the envelope into the ballot box and signs the voter list.

Candidates can send representatives to observe every part of the process, and late in the afternoon, votes are counted by volunteers, under strict supervision, who follow specific procedures.

Four female sit-skiers were unable to complete their routes, while 45 of the 117 total skiers in the Giant Slalom failed to qualify for the race.
Madhya Pradesh Police has recovered the stolen laptop and mobile phone.
Deputy Inspector General D.K. Arya stated: We have arrested five people who raped the Swiss woman and have recovered her mobile phone and laptop.
The accused are Baba Kanjar, Botha Kanjar, Rambhu Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar and Vishnu Kanjar.
Police chief Chandra Shekhar Solanki said the accused appeared in court with masks on.
Although three people were inside the house when the car crashed, no one was injured.
However, the driver suffered a serious head injury.
The crash road was temporarily closed as emergency services were pulling the driver from the red Audi TT.
He was first admitted to James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He then went to Addenbrooke's practice in Cambridge.
Anticoya has since been charged by the High Court of Edinburgh with the murder of her son.
She's being held on charges and pending trial, but any circumstantial eyewitness accounts may have been compromised as her image has been widely publicized.
This is common practice in other parts of the UK, but the justice system in Scotland works differently and courts have ruled that the publication of photos is potentially damaging.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee reports that journalists seem to be standing on a tightrope if they publish photos etc. of suspects.
The prosecution, which is generally responsible for prosecutions, has informed reporters that there will be no further comment at least until the indictment is announced.
According to leaked information, the document will refer to the border dispute that Palestine wants based on the borders before the 1967 Middle East war.
The other issues covered reportedly included the future status of Jerusalem, which is a holy place for both states, as well as the issue of the Jordan Valley.
Israel requires a continuous military presence in the valley for ten years once an agreement is signed, while the Palestinian Authority agrees to allow such a presence for only five years.
The shooters in the complementary pest control trial would be under close supervision of the rangers as the trial would be monitored and its effectiveness assessed.
In cooperation with the National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS) and the Scout Federation of Australia (NSW), special volunteers were recruited as part of the Scout Federation's hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, General Manager of Parks Conservation and Heritage for the National Parks and Wildlife Service, the four rangers selected for the first hunting expedition received detailed safety and training instructions.
Yesterday Martelli was sworn in to a new Provisional Electoral Council (PEC) consisting of nine members.
This is the fifth temporary election board for Martelly in four years.
Last month a presidential commission recommended the previous resignation of the Provisional Electoral Council as part of a package of measures to lead the country to new elections.
The committee was Martelli's response to the widespread anti-establishment protests that began in October.
Some violent protests were due to the non-calling of elections, some pending since 2011.
According to official reports, there were about 60 incidents of iPod malfunctions that resulted in high temperatures, starting six fires and leaving four people with minor injuries from the fire.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said it was aware of 27 accidents involving the devices.
Last week, the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) announced that Apple had informed it of 34 additional cases of global warming, which the company called "not serious".
The Ministry responded by calling it "really sorry" that Apple's report was postponed.
The earthquake struck the Mariana Islands at 07:19 a.m. local time (09:19 p.m. Greenwich time Friday).
The Mariana Islands Emergency Management Office said there were no reports of damage on their territory.
Also, the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center (PTWC) said there was no indication of a tsunami.
A Filipino ex-police officer took hostage Hong Kong visitors by hijacking their bus in Manila, his country's capital.
Rolando Mendoza fired at the tourists with his M16 rifle.
Several hostages have been rescued and at least six are confirmed dead so far.
Six of the hostages, including children and the elderly, were released early; so were the photographers from the Philippines.
The photographers later replaced an elderly lady who needed to use the toilet.
Leggins followed in his father's footsteps and chose a career in medicine.
He trained and became a gynaecologist, starting work in 1959 at the State Women's Clinic, Auckland.
While working at the hospital, Liggins, in his spare time, began researching preterm labor.
According to his research, if a hormone was administered, the embryonic lung would mature.
Xinhua said government investigators on Wednesday found two black box flight data recorders.
The fellow wrestlers paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said: "Luna was the first winner of the Queen of Extreme competition. My first manager. Luna died on the night of the two moons. Unique as herself. Powerful woman".
Dustin Goldstern Runnels commented that Luna was as weird as I am... maybe more... I love her and I'll miss her... hope she's in a better place.
Of the 1,400 people who participated in the poll ahead of the 2010 federal election, those opposed to Australia becoming a republic have increased by 8 percent since 2008.
Acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard argued during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed Australia should become a crownless republic when Queen Elizabeth II's reign ended.
34 percent of those polled agreed with this idea, because they want Queen Elizabeth II to be the last monarch of Australia.
On either end of the poll, 29% of all respondents believe Australia should become a republic without a monarchy as soon as possible, while 31% believe Australia should never become a republic without a monarchy.
The Olympic gold medallist was expected to compete in the 100m and 200m freestyle and three swimming events at the Commonwealth Games, but because of his discomfort his fitness is in question.
She couldn't take the medication she needed to stop the pain because it's banned from the Games.
Curtis Cooper, a professor of mathematics and computer science at the University of Central Missouri, on January 25 discovered the largest prime number found to date.
Several people verified the discovery using different hardware and software in early February and it was announced on Tuesday.
Comets may have been a source of water transport to earth as well as organic matter that can form proteins and support life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form, especially how the Earth formed, as comets collided with the Earth long ago.
Cuomo, who is 53 years old, became governor earlier this year and last month signed a bill legalizing same-sex marriage.
He referred to the rumors as "political gossip and nonsense".
He's expected to run for president in 2016.
The Federal Aviation Administration claims that the new generation air transport system would allow aircraft to fly shorter routes, save gallons of fuel each year, and reduce carbon emissions.
The technology it uses is satellite-based as opposed to older ground-based radar-based technology to allow air traffic controllers to more accurately locate an aircraft and give more accurate information to pilots.
No additional transport is taking place and the underground railways will not stop at Wembley. Car parking spaces and parking and transfer facilities are not available on the ground.
Fears of a lack of transportation raise the possibility that the match will be forced to be held behind closed doors, without the team's supporters.
A study reported Thursday in Science revealed the existence of a new type of bird in the Galapagos Islands.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that the new species evolved in just two generations, although the process is believed to have taken much longer, due to the breeding between the native Darwin's spider of the genus Geospiza fortes and the exotic spider of the genus Geospiza contris.
Gold can be cut into all shapes, shaped into shapes of minimal size.
It can be carved into a fine wire, then bent and braided, forged or wrapped in sheets.
It can become very thin and stick to other metals, and it can become so thin that it was sometimes used as decoration in the hand-drawn book illustrations called iconographic manuscripts.
This is called the pH of a chemical, and you can make a gauge using red cabbage juice.
The juice of the cabbage changes color depending on how acidic or basic (alkaline) the chemical is.
The pH level is determined by the amount of hydrogen ions (the H at pH) in the test chemical.
Hydrogen ions are protons that no longer have their electrons (as a hydrogen atom is made up of one proton and one electron).
Roll the two dry powders together and then, with clean and wet hands, press them into a ball.
The moisture in your palms will react with the outer shells, which will create a strange sensation and make something like a skin.
The towns of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro provided a toilet with a toilet bowl for each household, connected to a sophisticated sewage system.
Also in Greece, in the settlements of the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini, ruins of drainage systems have been found.
Toilets also appeared in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China.Toilets in Rome were often part of public baths, where all people of any gender were mixed together.
When you call someone who's far away, it uses a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the call and then sends it back to earth almost instantly.
The satellite was launched by a rocket, and experts have space telescopes because our planet's atmosphere distorts our light and visibility.
It takes a giant rocket over 100 feet high to send a satellite or a telescope into space.
The contribution of the wheel to the world is amazing, but the most important thing is the simplest and fastest way to get around.
Thanks to him, we have trains, cars, and many other transportation machines.
Below them are cats of more moderate size, feeding on medium-sized prey ranging from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
After all, there are many predatory kitties (including free-ranging domestic cats) that prey on the many insects, rodents, sauropods, and birds.
The secret to their success is the idea of position, a special role each cat has, that prevents competition between them.
Lions are the most social of all the animals, living in large groups called herds.
The flocks consist of one to three adult males interbreeding with up to thirty females with their young.
Females usually have a close bond with each other, forming a large family of sisters and daughters.
Lion herds act much like wolf or dog herds, animals that are strikingly similar to lions (but not other large domestic animals) in behavior, and are also extremely deadly to their prey.
The tiger, as a complete athlete, can climb (not at a very good level), swim, make huge leaps and put five times the force of a strong man to lift something.
The tiger is in the same category (genus Panthyrina) as lions, leopards, and jaguars. These four cats are the only ones that can purr.
The tiger's roar is not like the loud roar of a lion, but it is more like a phrase than angry, loud words.
The oseloth prefers small animals, and will hunt monkeys, snakes, rodents, and even birds, but almost all the animals the oseloth hunts are smaller than it.
Scientists believe that the ospreys track and find animals to feed (hunt) by sniffing, sniffing the ground to see where they are.
They see very well in the dark through night vision and move silently, the oselots hunt their prey through adaptation to their environment and then surprise attack on their prey.
When a small group of living organisms (small population) is separated from the main population from which it came (for example if they move to a mountain range or a river, or if they move to a new island so that they cannot easily return) they will often encounter a different environment than in the past.
This new environment has new resources and different competitors, so the new population will need different characteristics or adaptations to be a strong competitor compared to what was required in the past.
The indigenous people have not changed at all, they need to make the same adjustments as in the past.
As time passes, as the new population begins to adapt to the new environment, the resemblance to the rest of the population diminishes.
At some point, after thousands or perhaps millions of years, the two populations will look so different that they cannot be considered the same species.
This process is called epigenesis, which means the formation of new species.
Plants produce the oxygen that humans breathe and absorb the carbon dioxide that humans exhale (that is, exhale).
Plants create their food from the sun through photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
Our homes and our clothes are made from plants, the food we eat is mostly plants, and without plants, animal survival would be impossible.
Mosasaurus was the top predator of its time, so he was not afraid of anything except other Mosasaurus.
Its long jaws had over 70 razor-sharp teeth combined with an extra row of teeth at the top of its mouth, indicating that there was no escape for anything that came its way.
We don't know for sure, but it may have had a forked tongue, fed on turtles, big fish, other mosasaurs, and may have been a cannibal.
He would attack anything that entered the water, and even the giant Tyrannosaurus would not be a match for him.
Although most of their food would be familiar to us, the Romans also had a number of strange or unusual festive dishes, including the following, wild boar, peacocks, snails, and a type of rodent called glyrids.
Another difference was that the poor and women ate their meals sitting in chairs, while the rich men preferred to eat in banquets where they could relax on their side while dining.
Meals in ancient Rome could not contain foods that arrived in Europe from America or Asia centuries later.
For example, there was no corn, tomato, potato, or cocoa, and no ancient Roman had ever eaten turkey.
The Babylonians built for each of their gods a primary temple that was considered the home of the god.
The people would slaughter the deities and the clergy would try to meet the deities' wishes by organizing rituals and celebrations.
In each temple there is an open courtyard and then an inner sanctuary to which only the priests have access.
Sometimes they built certain towers in a pyramidal shape called ziggurats, and they were part of the temples.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary for the god.
In the hot climate of the Middle East, the roof was not so important.
The Jewish family spent most of its life in the countryside.
Women cooked in the courtyard, while shops were open stalls facing the street.
The land of Canaan had no large tracts of forest, so timber was very expensive.
Greenland was sparsely populated, and the Norse saga tells that Eric the Red was banished from Iceland for murder and, as he travelled west, found Greenland and gave it that name.
However, despite its discovery, the Eskimos were already living there at that time.
Although each country was Scandinavian, the people, kings, customs and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland were very different.
If you've seen the movie In Search of Lost Treasure, you might think that on the back of the Declaration of Independence is some treasure map written.
Although there is a note on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
On the back of the Declaration of Independence was written the following: "Original Declaration of Independence, issued July 4, 1776". This is written downwards, backwards.
Although no one knows for sure who wrote it, it is known that from the beginning the large parchment document (293⁄4 by 241⁄2 inches) was rolled up for storage.
Therefore, the footnote may have been added merely as a footnote.
The Normandy landings and the battles that followed liberated the French North, but the South was still not free.
It was run by the Vichy Government, which was made up of Frenchmen who had made peace with the Germans in 1940 and were working with the invaders rather than fighting them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies invaded southern France; the raid was called Operation Dragon.
Within two weeks, the Americans and the Free French forces had liberated the south of France, and Germany was next.
Culture is a unique tradition shared by a large group of people living and working together, a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin civilis, meaning civil, which is related to the Latin civis, meaning citizen, and civitas, meaning city or city-state, and this in fact describes the size of society in some way.
Cities-states are the ancestors of states. A cultural culture implies the transmission of knowledge from generation to generation, a continuous cultural imprint and a magnificent diffusion.
Often, smaller civilizations disappear without leaving behind any relevant historical evidence and fail to be recognized as normal civilizations.
During the War of Independence, the thirteen states initially formed a weak central government - with Congress being the sole constituent - based on the Articles of Confederation.
Congress had no taxing authority, and because it had no executive or judicial authority, it relied on state authorities, who were uncooperative, to enforce all laws.
Furthermore, he had no jurisdiction to override the laws on taxation and customs between the states.
The Articles required the unanimous consent of all the states before they could be amended, but the states took the government so seriously that their representatives were often absent.
The national football teams of Italy and Germany are the second most successful teams in the world and were the champions of the 2006 FIFA World Cup.
Popular sports include soccer, basketball, volleyball, polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, ice hockey, and Formula One racing.
Winter sports are most popular in the Nordic countries, with Italians participating in international competitions and Olympic Games events.
Japan is made up of nearly 7,000 islands (the largest being Honshu), making it the 7th largest island on the planet!
Because of the island complex/group that Japan has, the latter is often referred to as the "Archipelago", from a geographical point of view.
The origins of Taiwan go back to the 15th century, when passing European sailors named the island Ilha Formosa, or Beautiful Island.
In 1624 the Dutch East India Company established a base in the southwestern part of Taiwan and began a transformation of the practices by which native grain was produced, employing Chinese laborers in the rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the Qing dynasty (1644-1912) dominated western and northern Taiwan, which they made an administrative district of their empire in 1885.
After losing the First Sino-Japanese War (1984-1985), the Qing Dynasty then signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, which left Taiwan in Japanese hands until 1945.
Matsu Pitsou consists of three main structures, namely the Intiwatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room with Three Windows.
Most of the buildings in the complex have been built from scratch in order to give tourists a better idea of what their original appearance was like.
By 1976, 30 percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and the restoration is still going on today.
For example, the most common form of still image photography is 35 mm worldwide, which was the predominant film size in the late analogue film era.
It's still produced today, but the most important thing is the aspect ratio inherited from the image sensor formats of the digital camera.
The 35mm format is actually 36mm wide, which creates confusion, and 24mm high.
The ratio of dimensions of this arrangement (divided by twelve to get the simplest ratio of integers) is therefore 3:2.
Many common formats (the APS class of formats, for example) are equal to or closely approximate these image ratios.
The rule of three, which is often abused and mocked, is a simple guideline that creates dynamism while maintaining order to a degree in a picture.
It states that the most effective point for the main subject is at the intersection of the lines dividing the image into three parts vertically and horizontally (see example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, now rich and powerful, was brought under control.
For more than a thousand years, the Christian religion has created unbreakable bonds between European states despite any differences in language and customs.
His omnipresent power affected everyone, from kings to mere mortals.
One of the main beliefs of Christianity is that wealth should be used to relieve the poor and suffering, and the funds of the churches are raised specifically for this purpose.
The central authority of the church was based in Rome for over a thousand years, and this concentration of power and wealth led many to wonder whether doctrine was being properly implemented.
Great Britain began to block Germany by sea, immediately after the beginning of the attacks.
The strategy has been effective, with cuts in vital military and civilian supplies, even though this blockade has violated generally accepted international law codified by various international agreements of the last two centuries.
The United Kingdom has placed mines in international waters to prevent the movement of ships in any part of the sea, threatening even neutral ships.
Since there was limited reaction to this tactic, Germany expected the same for its unimpeded submarine warfare.
During the 1920's, the attitude adopted by most citizens and nations was one of peace and isolation.
States, having seen the horrors and atrocities of war during World War I, wanted to avoid a repeat of such a situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States of America to take up a job with the Edison Company.
He arrived in the United States with four cents to his name, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (manager at his previous job) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of differentiating each distinct period of time, each stage of China or each ruling family, and each distinct dynasty.
Between each dynasty there was also a volatile era of divided provinces, the most famous of these periods being the Three Kingdoms period that prevailed for 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
In those times there was a fierce war between many nobles fighting for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest periods in the history of ancient China, as thousands of people lost their lives fighting for the throne of the great palace in Xi'an.
The social and political implications are many and include the use of the metric system, a shift from authoritarianism to democracy, patriotism and the belief that the country does not belong to a single ruler, but to all the people.
Also, after the Revolution, the professions were accessible to all male job seekers, enabling the most ambitious and successful to succeed.
The same was true of the army, as instead of being ranked by rank, they were now ranked by measurement.
The French Revolution also inspired many other oppressed individuals of the working classes in other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was keenly interested in matters beyond this worldly life. He often visited a cave which became known as Hira on the mountain Nur (light) for meditation.
The cave itself, where he survived the passage of time, provides a very vivid picture of Muhammad's spiritual calling.
The cave is isolated from the world as it is located on the side of a hill north of Mecca.
In fact, it's not at all easy for someone to find it even if they know it exists.
Nothing is visible beyond the clear, beautiful sky and the many surrounding mountains, and very little of this world is visible or audible from inside the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the seven wonders of the world still standing today.
Built by the Egyptians in the 3rd century B.C.E., the Great Pyramid is one of many large pyramid-shaped structures built to honor dead pharaohs.
The Giza Plateau, or "Necropolis of Giza", located in Egypt's Valley of the Dead, has several pyramids (the largest of which is the Pyramid of Hephaz), a few small tombs, several temples, and the great Sphinx.
The great pyramid was built in honor of the Pharaoh Khufu, and many of the smaller pyramids, as well as the smaller tombs and temples, were built in honor of Khufu's wife and family members.
The sign indicating that the beam must be moved upwards is like a V and the sign indicating the movement downwards is like a wire or square without its lower side.
Playing up means you have to start from the edge, pushing the bow, and playing down means you have to start from the frog (the point where your hand holds the bow) and pull it.
Playing the drum upwards produces a softer sound, while playing it downwards is louder and more dynamic.
You are free to add your own signs, but keep in mind that the ones that exist have a musical function, so they often need to be considered.
On 6 October 1789, a mob of market women forced King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (eleven-year-old Maria Thérèse and four-year-old Louis Charles) and the king's sister, Lady Elizabeth, who had been terrorized, to return from Versailles to Paris.
They traveled back to Paris in a carriage surrounded by a crowd of people shouting and threatening the King and Queen.
The crowd forced the King and Queen to open the windows of their carriage wide.
At one point, a man in the crowd began shaking the head of a member of the royal guard who had been killed at Versailles, in front of the terrified queen.
The cost of the United States' imperialist war for the Philippines was paid by the Filipino people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the colonial regime of the United States to cover a large part of the expenses, and the bond rates were being manipulated on behalf of the Philippine government through Wall Street banking houses.
Of course, the surplus gains that resulted from the long exploitation of the Filipino people were to be the main gains of American imperialism.
To understand the Knights, one must understand the context that prompted the order's creation.
The time when the events took place is often called the Late Middle Ages, the period of European history in the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1,000-1300 C.E.).
The High Middle Ages followed the Early Middle Ages and were preceded by the Late Middle Ages, which by convention ends around 1500.
Technological rationality is a term that encompasses a variety of ideas in practice, from the promotion or enforcement of technology, to the strict interpretation that the future of humanity is governed by an underlying logic directly linked to scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two central ideas: that technology development itself follows a course largely outside of cultural and political influence, and that technology in turn exerts its influence on societies of innate character, rather than societies adapted to the present.
For example, one might claim that the car necessarily leads to road development.
However, a nationwide road network is not economically viable for a small number of vehicles, so new production methods are being developed with the aim of reducing the cost of car ownership.
The mass ownership regime also leads to higher rates of road accidents, which in turn lead to new methods in health care for the repair of bodily injuries.
Romanticism had a significant element of cultural determinism, coming from authors such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
In the Romantic era, geography shaped people, and over time, customs and cultural elements in harmony with this geography emerged, which, being in harmony with the position of society, were better than arbitrarily imposed laws.
Just as Paris is considered the source of style in the modern age, so too is Constantinople the corresponding European source during feudalism.
Its reputation as a center of plenty began to spread about 400 C.E. and lasted until about 1100 C.E.
Its prestige was diminished in the twelfth century, mainly because of the Crusaders who brought back materials such as silk and spices, which were of higher value than the products of Byzantine markets.
It was then that the title of the Capital of Fashion was transferred from Istanbul to Paris.
The Gothic style reached its heyday between the 10th and 11th centuries, as well as the 14th century.
Early dress was strongly influenced by Byzantine culture in the east.
However, the slow communication channels resulted in 25 to 30 years of delay in technology in the west.
In the late Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the most important developments of the era, resulting from the Crusades, was that people began to button their clothes.
Maintenance farming is farming that is done to produce enough food to meet the needs of the farmer and his family alone.
Survival agriculture is a simple, usually biological system of using stored seeds from the local ecosystem, combined with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to maximize yields.
Traditionally, farmers have been predominantly self-sufficient, and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together like-minded people who feel marginalized by social norms, enabling them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures are divided by age, origin, social class, location and/or race.
The qualities that make a subculture distinctive may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographic, or a combination of factors.
To mark their status, members of a subculture often adopt a distinctive and symbolic style, which includes various fashions, particular attitudes and slang.
A key technique for the meaning of socialization is to rely on the few incidents of children who, due to neglect, bad luck or mistreatment, were not socialized with adults during their lifetime.
Such children are called "savages" or "wild".[citation needed] Some wild children have been isolated by humans, usually their parents themselves, and in some cases this abandonment of the child was due to rejection by the parents due to the child's severe mental or physical disability.
Wild children are likely to have experienced severe abuse or traumatic experiences before they are abandoned or before they run away.
Others are said to have been raised by animals; some are supposed to have lived alone in the wild.
A feral child, when raised entirely by animals without contact with humans, exhibits behaviors (within natural limits) that almost exactly resemble those of the animal that cared for it, such as fear or indifference to humans.
While project-based teaching makes learning easier and more interesting, assistive technology goes one step further.
The curriculum is not a way of learning but rather a helping hand to people undergoing a new teaching experience, such as learning a new computer program or starting a new project.
There are virtual and real curses, in other words, the teacher is a form of cursing, but the same is true for the Microsoft Office connector man.
The virtual aids are embedded in software and are intended to ask, promote and explain processes which may have been very difficult for students to handle.
Children are placed in foster care for a variety of reasons ranging from neglect and abuse to even blackmail.
No child should ever grow up in an environment without care, love and education, but it does happen.
We see the foster care system as a safe zone for these kids.
Our foster care system is supposed to provide safe homes, loving caregivers, stable education and affordable health care.
Foster care is supposed to provide all the needs that the child did not receive in the home from which he or she was removed.
The Internet includes elements of both mass and interpersonal communication.
The specific characteristics of the Internet result in additional dimensions in the approach to uses and rewards.
For example, 'learning' and 'socialising' are considered to be important motivators for using the Internet (James et al., 1995).
'Personal involvement' and 'continuous relationships' were also identified as aspects of motivation by Eighmey and McCord (1998) in their study of audience reactions to websites.
Video has made great discoveries in understanding microscopic expressions, our expressions that hold infinitesimally little.
In particular, it is said that one can detect whether a person is lying by correctly interpreting the small phrases.
Oliver Sacks, in his essay "The President's Speech", notes that people who are unable to understand speech because of brain damage are nevertheless able to discern sincerity accurately.
It is further thought that these abilities in understanding human behavior are exhibited in animals such as domestic dogs.
A twentieth-century study showed that there are two forms of genetic diversity, latent and expressed.
Mutation adds new genetic variants and selection removes them from the pool of expressed variants.
Distribution and mixing redistribute the diversity between the two sides in each family.
Out on the savannah, it is difficult for a primate with a digestive system like ours to satisfy its need for amino acids from available plant sources.
Moreover, their failure to do so had serious consequences: stunted growth, malnutrition, and eventually death.
The most readily available plant resources would be proteins that can be incorporated into leaves and algae, but are difficult to assimilate by primate mammals like us, unless they're cooked.
By contrast, animal foods (ant, termites, eggs) are not only easily digestible but also are important sources of protein containing all the essential amino acids.
Taking all the evidence into account, it's not surprising that our ancestors faced the protein issue the way chimpanzees do in the savannah today.
Sleep interruption is the process whereby you consciously wake up during the normal sleep interval and fall back asleep after a short time (10-60 minutes).
This can easily be done by using a relatively quiet wake-up clock so that you regain consciousness without waking up completely.
If you find yourself turning off the alarm clock while you sleep, you can place it on the other side of the room so that you have to get up to turn it off.
Other biorhythm-based options include drinking plenty of fluids (especially water or tea, known to be diuretic) before bedtime to force the patient to stand up to urinate.
The amount of inner peace a person has is inversely proportional to the amount of tension in his body and mind.
The less pressure, the better the life force is present, and each person has the ability to find absolute calm and contentment.
Anyone can achieve enlightenment, and the only thing standing in the way of that goal is the tension and negativity within each of us.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but it was expanded by the mahayana path of love and many techniques of Indian yoga.
Tibetan Buddhism, in its essence, is very simple, it consists of Kundalini yoga, meditation and the path of love that embraces all.
In Kundalini yoga, Kundalini (enlightenment) energy is awakened by movements, inhaling and exhaling practices, mantras and visualizations.
The focus of Tibetan meditation is the deity Yog, through the vision of various deities, the energy channels are cleansed, chakras are energized, and the consciousness of enlightenment is created.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, leading to cooperation between the USSR and the United States. At the end of the war, conflicts at the level of systems, processes and culture led the two countries to a rift.
As two years had passed since the war ended, the former allies were now enemies and the Cold War began.
It would last for 40 years and would have proxy warfare in battlefields from Africa to Asia, Afghanistan, Cuba and many other areas.
By September 17, 1939, the Polish defences had already been broken, and the only hope was to retreat and regroup on the Romanian bridgehead.
However, these plans were rendered useless almost overnight when more than 800,000 Soviet Red Army soldiers entered and formed the Belarus Front and the Ukraine Front, having invaded the eastern territories of Poland in violation of the Peace Treaty of Riga, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact and other international treaties, both bilateral and multilateral.
The use of ships for the transport of goods is by far the most efficient way of moving large sections of the population and goods across the ocean.
The work of the Navy has long been to ensure that your country can transport your own people and goods, while preventing your enemy from transporting his own people and goods.
One of the most notable recent examples was the North Atlantic campaign during World War II, in which the Americans tried to transport men and supplies across the Atlantic Ocean to aid Britain.
At the same time, the German navy, using mostly submarines, was trying to disrupt this traffic.
If the Allies failed, the Germans could in all probability conquer Britain as they did the rest of Europe.
Goats were probably first domesticated in the Zagros Mountains of Iran 10,000 years ago.
Ancient cultures and tribes begin to keep them for easy access to milk, wool, meat and skin.
Domestic goats were generally kept in herds roaming hills or other pastures, often tended by shepherds who were usually children or teenagers, similar to the more widely known herdsmen.
Wooden rails were being built in England as early as the 16th century.
Although the wooden rails consisted only of parallel wooden planks, they allowed the horses pulling the carriages to reach greater speeds and pull greater loads than on the slightly rougher roads of the day.
Wooden rack connections appeared early enough to hold railway tracks in place, but it gradually became apparent that rails would be much more functional with an iron support at the top.
This was a common method, but iron created more wear on the wheels of wooden carriages.
Eventually, wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels, and in 1767 the first all-iron railway lines appeared.
The first known means of transportation was walking, and humans began walking upright two million years ago with the appearance of Homo erectus.
Their ancestors, the Australopithecus, did not walk upright as is common.
Evidence of bipedal movement has been found in Australopithecus fossils from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, although the Sahelian may have walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We have the opportunity to live more sustainable lives, to be part of the environmental movement, and perhaps to take some activist action to somehow limit the problems of the future.
It's like treating symptoms in many cases, but if we don't want a transient treatment, we're going to have to find the source of the issues and neutralize them.
It is quite evident that the world has changed a lot because of mankind's scientific and technological achievements, and that problems have grown because of overpopulation and wasteful living.
After it was approved by Congress on July 4th, the handwritten memo signed by Congressman John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thompson was sent a few blocks away to John Dunlap's printing office.
During the night, between 150 and 200 copies, now known as the "Danlap Briefs", were issued.
The first public reading of the document was given by John Nixon on July 8 in the outdoor area of the Independence Hall.
A copy was sent on July 6 to George Washington, who had it read to his troops in New York on July 9, another arrived in London on August 10.
The 25 Dunlap pamphlets that we know of that still exist are the oldest surviving copies of the document.
Many paleontologists now believe that one species of dinosaur has survived to the present day.
They are not seen in the dinosaur category by many because they have feathers having the ability to fly.
But there are many things about birds that make them look like dinosaurs.
They have legs with scales and claws, they lay eggs, and they walk on two legs like a Tyrannosaurus Rex.
Computers are now based on the management of information encoded in a binary system.
To use computer terminology, a binary number can only take one or two values, i.e. 0 or 1, and these numbers are called binary digits or bits.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately apparent; symptoms such as vomiting are sufficiently general to make a direct diagnosis impossible.
The most telling sign that someone has been poisoned internally is an open bottle of medication or some toxic household chemical in the room.
Read the label for specific first-aid instructions for this particular poison.
The term correa is officially used by ethnologists for this group of insects.
This term comes from the ancient people's familiarity with bedbugs, which were insects that were easily adapted to parasitize humans.
The insect-killer and the bedbug are nest-dwellers, adapted to live in the nest or enclosure of their host.
In the United States of America, there are about 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), making it the leading neurological disease among the young and middle-aged.
MS affects the central nervous system, which includes the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Research shows that women are twice as likely to develop multiple sclerosis as men.
Two partners may decide that raising an infant is not in their best interests or in the best interests of the child they have.
These couples can design an adoption plan for their baby.
In adoption, the biological parents terminate their parental rights so that another couple can raise the child.
The basic goal of science is to understand how the world works through the scientific method, which is the basis of most scientific research.
But it's not just experimentation, and experimentation is a test that's done to disprove one or more hypotheses, and asking questions and observing also guides scientific inquiry.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts, specifically the Latin version of the Bible.
Aristotle's views on scientific matters, including psychology, were accepted.
As Greek intellectuals lost ground, the West was cut off from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many have observed that often the rhythms that occur in physiology and behavior depend on the existence of endogenous cycles, and their production by biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms, which are not simply responses to external periodic signals, have been recorded for most organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators, which continue to cycle continuously even when no external stimuli are present.
The Hersey and Chase experiment was one of the main suggestions that DNA is genetic material.
Hershey and Chase took phages, or microbes, to put their genetic material into a bacterium.
They conducted two experiments in which they marked either the DNA in the phage using radioactive phosphorus or the phage protein using radioactive sulfur.
Mutations may produce a wide variety of different effects depending on the type of mutation, how important the role of the part of the genetic material it affects is, and whether the cells affected are stem cells.
Only mutations in stem cells can be passed on to offspring, as mutations in other cells can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature tourism attracts people who are looking for natural landscapes to enjoy nature, along with the wild flora and fauna of the area.
Examples of activities in a given location are hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, and visiting parks, as well as studying information pertaining to the ecosystem.
For example, some visit, photograph, and learn about the Borneo orangutans.
Every morning, people leave small towns in their cars to go to work and meet others whose work destination is the place from which the first ones have just left.
In dynamic shuttle transport, everyone is connected in some way and supports a transport system based on private vehicles.
Today, science shows that this huge carbon economy has taken the biosphere out of a stable state that has supported the evolution of the human species for the last two million years.
Every individual participates in society and uses some form of transportation, and almost everyone has a complaint about transportation systems.
In developed countries, complaints about water quality or collapsing bridges are rarely heard at the same level.
Why are transportation systems such a complaint, why do they fail every day? Are the transportation engineers simply incompetent? Or is something more substantial at play?
Traffic flow is the analysis of the flow of specific drivers and cars between two locations and the interactions that occur between them.
Unfortunately, studying the flow of traffic is not easy, as it is impossible to predict with complete certainty the behaviour of drivers.
Fortunately, drivers tend to behave within a range of reasonable consistency; thus, traffic flows tend to have some logical consistency and can be approximated mathematically.
To better represent traffic intensity, relationships have been established between the three main characteristics: (1) intensity, (2) density and (3) speed.
These relationships helped in the preparation, design and operation of road network installations.
The first animals to take off were insects, whose ability to fly helped them avoid enemies more easily and find food and mates more efficiently.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings backwards along their body.
This provides them with a greater variety of small hiding places than predators.
Now, the only insects that can't fold their wings are the dragonflies and the nightbirds.
Many years ago, Aristarchus reported that the solar system rotated perpendicular to the sun.
Some thought he was right, but many thought the opposite, that the Solar System revolved around the Earth and the Sun (and even other stars).
It makes sense, since the Earth doesn't seem to be moving, right?
The Amazon River is the second longest river on the planet, and the largest river overall, carrying over eight times more water than the second longest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river in the world, sometimes reaching six miles.
20% of the water that the Earth's rivers discharge into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The main Amazon River is 6,387 kilometers (3,980 miles) long, and it gathers water from thousands of smaller rivers.
While the construction of pyramids from stone continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, none surpassed the pyramids of Giza in size and technical perfection in construction.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom era were impressed by the monuments of their ancestors, which were then over a thousand years old.
With a population of about 800, Vatican City is the smallest independent state in the world and the one with the smallest population.
The Vatican uses Italian in legislation and in official communications.
Italian is also used in everyday life by most people working for the state, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholics.
The basic elements such as gold, silver, and copper have been known to man since ancient times, as they are all found in nature in the raw form and relatively easy to extract with primitive tools.
The philosopher Aristotle held that all things are created by the combination of one or more of the four elements, earth, water, air, and fire.
It looked primarily like the four forms of matter (in that order): solid, liquid, air, and plasma, though it also assumed that they changed into new substances to form this presence.
Alloys are essentially a mixture of two or more metals, and remember, there are many chemical elements on the periodic table.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered metals. There are of course other metals such as silver and gold.
There are also alloys that contain small amounts of non-metallic elements such as carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter, and all matter is made of very small particles, atoms.
The size of the atoms is so extremely small that a trillion of them could fit in the period at the end of this sentence.
Thus, when pencil was introduced, it became a good friend to many.
Unfortunately, as newer writing methods have emerged, the pencil's place and usefulness have been degraded.
People now write messages on computer screens without ever having to pick up a scissor.
One may wonder what will become of the keyboard when something new appears.
The fission bomb is based on the principle that energy is required to form a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
It's like a heavy cart rolling down a hill, and by breaking through the core again, some of that energy is released.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, and this causes them to split if little or no pressure is applied.
The surface of the moon is made of rocks and dust, and the outer layer of the moon is called the crust.
The crust is about 70 km thick on the near side and about 100 km on the far side.
It's thinner under the seas and thicker under the plateaus.
There may be more seas on the near side because the crust is thinner, the lava could be better at going to the surface.
Content theories focus on discovering what makes people click or what attracts them.
These theories argue that individuals have certain needs and/or desires that have been internalized as they mature and reach adulthood.
These theories study what makes certain people want what they want and what is in their environment that will drive them to do or not do certain things.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs and Herzberg's two-factor theory.
In general, two behaviours can emerge when managers start mentoring their former peers: one end of the spectrum is to try to remain as one of the children (or one of the children).
This type of manager has difficulty making unpopular decisions, taking disciplinary action, performing evaluations, assigning responsibilities and putting people in charge.
At the other end of the spectrum, one can be transformed into an unrecognizable individual who feels that he or she has to change everything the group has done and take it for granted.
After all, the one ultimately responsible for the team's success and failure is the leader.
This behavior often leads to a rift between the leader and the rest of the team.
Virtual groups are created with the same finiteness principles as conventional groups, however there are some slight differences.
Virtual team members often act as a link to their immediate physical team.
Often, they are more autonomous than conventional team members, as their teams may meet according to different time zones, which may not be acceptable to their local administration.
The existence of a true invisible group (Larson and La Fasto, 1989, p. 109) is another unique element of a virtual group.
Each person presents himself to the visible management team, which sets the specifications for all participants.
Why would an organization want to go through this time-consuming process of establishing the learning capabilities of the organization? One of the goals for the practical application of the concepts of learning capabilities of the organization is innovation.
Creativity and intelligence are fostered when all available resources in the functional departments of an organisation are used appropriately.
As a result, the process in which an organisation works together to overcome a barrier can lead to new innovative processes in service to customer needs.
To be innovative, management must create an environment of innovation, knowledge sharing and organisational learning.
The explanation given by Engel (2006) for the continuous learning approach describes it as a method used to help organizations to increase their level of performance.
Neurobiological evidence provides physical evidence for a theoretical study of the mind, so it narrows the breadth of the research to make it more clear.
The link between brain pathology and behavior is a helpful tool for researchers and their study.
It's long been known that various types of brain damage, injuries, bruises and tumors affect behavior and may cause changes in some mental functions.
The emergence of new technologies allows us to see and explore brain structures and processes that humans have never seen before.
This gives us a lot of information and material to create simulation models that will help us understand the processes that are going on in our minds.
Although AI is largely science fiction, it is nevertheless an important branch of computer science that deals with the adaptation of behavior, learning and intelligence to a machine.
Research in artificial intelligence involves the construction of machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include control, scheduling, responding to customer diagnoses and queries, but also handwriting recognition, speech recognition, and facial recognition.
These are now separate entities, focused on providing solutions to real-life problems.
AI systems are now often used in the fields of finance, healthcare, engineering, and the military, and are even embedded in various home computer software applications and cyber games.
Excursions are an important element of any classroom, and very often a teacher would like to take his students to places that are accessible by bus, but that are not an option.
Technology offers the solution with virtual tours, where students can see museum exhibits, visit an aquarium, or admire beautiful artwork while in class.
In fact, taking part in an excursion is also an important opportunity to reflect on the journey and share experiences with future classes.
For example, every year, students from North Carolina's Bennet School design a website about their trip to the state capital, and it is updated every year, but the old versions are kept online and serve as a directory.
Blogs can also help improve a student's writing style, and while students' experience of blogs often starts with poor grammar and spelling, audience presence generally changes this.
Since students are often the most critical audience, the blogger starts to do his best to improve his writing style to avoid criticism.
Also, participation in weblogs "forces students to become more understanding about the world around them". The need to maintain the public interest inspires students to become intelligent and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Managing a website is a technique that promotes teamwork and encourages students to learn more than what they are classically taught in school in the morning.
The correct use of blogs can encourage students to use more analytical and critical thinking, as through active feedback on the online material, students can define their positions within the context of other people's texts, as well as express their own views on specific issues (Oravek, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada's enchanting, bilingual capital, and it includes a wide range of galleries and museums that showcase old and new Canada.
Further south are the Niagara Falls and to the north lies the untapped natural beauty of Muscoca and even beyond.
All of these and more characterize Ontario as the quintessential Canadian character as perceived by foreigners.
Large areas in the still northernmost part are fairly sparsely populated, while some are almost uninhabited wilderness areas.
For a population comparison that surprises many: African Americans living in the United States outnumber Canadians.
The East African Islands are located in the Indian Ocean, off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest and is by itself a continent in terms of its wildlife species.
Almost all the islets are independent or of French origin, and they are renowned for providing serene marine refuges.
The Arabs also brought Islam with them to the region and it was greatly expanded to the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonization began in the 15th century, when Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama traced the Cape of Good Hope route from Europe to India.
The place is enclosed to the north by the Sahel, while the Atlantic encloses it to the south and west side of the country.
Women: It is recommended that any woman travelling should declare her married status, regardless of her actual marital status.
It also helps to wear a ring (just not one that looks too expensive.
Women need to understand that different cultural customs can lead to acts that would be considered harassment, and it is not uncommon for them to be approached from behind, to be held by the hand, and so on.
Be firm in rejecting a man and don't be afraid to defend your position (cultural differences or not, no excuse!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century B.C. and became a strategic port for the Phoenicians, Romans and Merenids, who gave it the name Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it as Casa Branca, only to abandon it after an earthquake in 1755.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city and gave it the name of Daru I-Batiya, while the name Casablanca was given by Spanish merchants who established trading bases there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to shop in Morocco.
It's easy to find places around old Medina selling traditional Moroccan goods, such as tadjis, pottery, leather goods, nargile and a wide range of trinkets, but they're all tourist-oriented.
Goma is a city in the Democratic Republic of the Congo with a large tourist population in the east near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma suffered devastation from the eruption of the Nyiragongo volcano, whose lava covered almost all the city's streets, especially its center.
While Goma is relatively safe, any visit outside Goma should be studied to understand the state of the ongoing conflict in the North Kivu province.
The city is also a base for the climbing of Mount Nyiragongo together with some of the cheapest mountain gorilla tracking and observation programs in Africa.
You can use the boda-boda (clean motorcycle) to get around Goma. Usually the price (local) is about 500 Congolese francs for a short trip.
Coupled with its relative inaccessibility, Tibuktu has acquired the metaphorical meaning of an exotic, distant country.
Today, Timbuktu is a poverty-stricken city, despite its reputation as a tourist attraction and its airport.
In 1990 it was added to the list of World Heritage in Danger, because it is threatened by desert sand.
This is one of the most important stops during Henry Louis Gates' PBS special on the Wonders of the African World.
The city is completely different from the other cities in the country, as it has a predominantly Arab air rather than an African one.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is in the northern and eastern part of South Africa and is located on the border line of Mozambique in the east, Zimbabwe in the north, and its southern border is considered to be the Crocodile River.
The park covers 19,500 km2 and is divided into 14 different ecological interest areas each supporting different species of wildlife.
It is one of South Africa's most notable attractions and is referred to as the emblem of the South African National Parks (SANParks).
As with all South African National Parks, there are daily maintenance entrance tickets to the park.
It may be beneficial for someone to purchase a Wild Card, which provides entry either to selected parks in South Africa or to all of its national parks.
Hong Kong Island is also the name of the mainland of Hong Kong and is a magnet for many visitors.
The splendor of the buildings that form Hong Kong's urban panorama has been likened to a brilliant bar chart, highlighted by the presence of the waters of Victoria Harbour.
For a better view of Hong Kong, leave the island and go across to the Ka'uluan Pier.
The urban development of Hong Kong Island is for the most part concentrated in high density in arid areas along the northern coast.
This is the place where the British colonialists took over and, therefore, if you are looking for evidence of the area's colonial past, it's a good place to start.
The Sundarbans is the largest coastal mangrove forest zone in the world, extending 80 km into mainland Bangladesh and India from the coast.
The Sandarbans has been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The part of the forest that is on Indian soil is called the Sandarbans National Park.
The forests are not just mangrove swamps, though, but include some of the last remnants of the imposing jungle that once covered the Gangetic plain.
The Sundarbone covers an area of 3,850 square kilometres of which about a third is covered by water/elevation zones.
Since 1966, Sundarbans has been a wildlife sanctuary, and it is estimated that there are now 400 Bengal tigers and some 30,000 deer in the area.
Buses leave from the inter-district station (across the river) throughout the day, although most, especially those heading east and towards Jakarta/Bumdang, depart between 06:30 and 07:30.
Because buses between districts are usually full, it is suggested that you get a ticket a few days in advance.
Most areas are served by small Japanese Coaster buses, which are noted for their comfort and durability.
Public taxis are a quick and comfortable way to travel to nearby places such as Paro (150 N) and Punaha (200 N).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge that spans the Oyapock River connecting the cities of Oiapoque, Brazil, and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock, French Guiana.
The two towers are 83 meters high, 378 meters long, and have two corridors 3.50 meters wide.
The vertical gap below the bridge is 15 metres. The completion of the construction took place in August 2011 and it was closed to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is scheduled to be fully operational in September 2017, when the Brazilian customs checkpoints are expected to be completed.
The Guarani were the most important indigenous group inhabiting the territory of what is now known as eastern Paraguay, and lived as semi-nomadic hunter-gatherers who also engaged in subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region was home to other indigenous tribal groups such as the Guaicuru and the Paiuaua, who survived by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
In the 16th century Paraguay, formerly called the "Giant Indian Province", was born as a result of the dispute between the Spanish conquistadors and indigenous groups.
The period of colonization, which lasted three centuries, began with the Spanish.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to preserve much of its domestic character and identity.
Argentina is famous for having one of the best polo teams and players in the world.
The main tournament of the year takes place in the last month of the year at the Las Canitas water polo pools.
Here you can watch smaller tournaments and matches at other times of the year.
For news about tournaments and ticketing points for water polo matches, check out the Argentine Polo Union.
The official currency of the Falklands is the Falklands pound (FKP), which is equal to the value of the British pound sterling (GBP).
You can exchange currency at the only bank in the islands, which is located in Stanley opposite the FIC West store.
The British pound is generally accepted throughout the islands and Stanley credit cards as well as US dollars are commonly accepted.
In remote islands credit cards will likely not be accepted, although British and American currency may be accepted; ask the owners beforehand to find out what methods of payment are accepted.
It's almost impossible to convert Falkland currency outside the islands, so you do a currency conversion before you leave the islands.
Since Montevideo is south of the equator, it is summer when in the northern hemisphere it is winter and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropical zone, and in summer, temperatures above 30 °C (92 °F) are common.
The cold in winter is deceptive: temperatures rarely fall below zero, but the wind and humidity combine to create the feeling that it is colder than the thermometer indicates.
There are no particularly 'rainy' and 'dry' seasons: the amount of rainfall remains almost the same throughout the year.
Although many of the park's animals are accustomed to human presence, their wildness remains wild, so we should not feed or disturb them.
According to park officials, keep at least 100 yards away from bears and wolves and 25 yards away from all other wildlife!
As calm as bison may seem, Canadian deer, elk, bears, and almost any large animal can nevertheless be aggressive.
Every year, dozens of visitors are injured because they don't keep their distance, and these animals are big, wild, and can be dangerous, so give them some room.
Also, be aware that smells attract bears and other wildlife, so avoid carrying or cooking food with strong smells and keep the campsite clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa, located on the island of Upolu, and has a population of nearly 40,000.
Apia was founded in 1850, and since 1959 it has been the official capital of Samoa.
The harbor was the site of a famous naval showdown in 1889, when seven ships from Germany, the United States, and Britain refused to leave.
All ships were sunk except for one British battleship, with the loss of about 200 American and German lives.
During the struggle for independence organized by the Mao movement, a peaceful rally in the city ended with the assassination of the Tuapua supreme leader Tamase Lyalopi III.
There are many beaches, as Auckland has two harbours, the most popular being in this area.
The North Shore (in the North Harbor district) has beaches that are washed by the Pacific Ocean and stretch from Long Bay in the North to Devonport in the South.
Almost all of the sandy beaches are suitable for safe swimming, and most are shaded by pohuatauwa trees.
The beaches of Tamaki Drive are in the Waitemata Harbour of the luxurious Mission Bay and St Heliers suburbs in Central Auckland.
These beaches are sometimes crowded with families with quite a variety of shops along the coastline.
The main local beer is called Number One and is not a complex beer, but is pleasant and refreshing.
A wide variety of French wines are available for tasting, but wines from New Zealand and Australia may be a better choice.
The local tap water is perfectly safe to drink, but if you are afraid, you can easily find bottled water.
In Australia the concept of flat white coffee is foreign, short black is espresso, cappuccino is inflated with cream rather than foam, and tea is drunk without milk.
The hot chocolate is up to Belgian standards, the fruit juices are expensive, but they're amazing.
Throughout the year, many trips are made to the reef, and injuries due to any of these causes are rare on the reef.
Nevertheless, you take advice from the authorities, obey all signs, and pay close attention to safety warnings.
Since 1770 the jellyfish have been appearing near beaches and river mouths from October to April, occasionally spotted at different times of the year.
Sharks do exist, but they rarely attack humans, most sharks are afraid of them and would swim away from them.
Sea crocodiles do not inhabit the sea, their primary natural habitat being the estuaries north of Rockhampton.
Booking early ensures that travelers will have a place to stay once they arrive at their destination.
Travel agents often make deals with specific hotels, but you can also book other types of accommodation, such as camping, through an agent.
Travel agents usually offer packages that include breakfast, airport transportation arrangements, or even combined flight and hotel packages.
Your application may be put on hold if you need time to reconsider the offer or to gather other documents for your trip (e.g. visa).
However, any amendments or requests should be addressed to the travel agent first and not sent directly to the hotel.
As for some festivals, most of the people who go to music festivals decide to camp there, and most of them consider it a very important part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the action, you should start early to find a campsite near the music.
Remember that while the music may end in the main stages, there may be parts of the festival where the music will continue late into the night.
Some festivals provide special camping areas for families with young children.
If you are crossing the northern Baltic Sea in winter, check the position of your cabin, as when the ship passes through ice it makes terrible noises for those most affected.
The cruises to St. Petersburg include time spent in the city, and those on board do not need a visa (see conditions).
Casinos usually go to great lengths to maximize the time and money spent by visitors, with windows and clocks being absent, and exits being hard to find.
Often special offers of food, drink, and entertainment are provided to keep customers in good spirits and on company premises.
Alcoholic beverages are offered free in various places, but drunkenness affects judgment, and a good gambler knows the importance of staying sober.
Anyone who is going to drive at high altitude or through mountain passes should consider the possibility of snow, ice and freezing temperatures.
On icy and snowy roads, there is not enough friction and it is difficult to drive compared to the bare asphalt.
During a snowstorm, it can snow so much that you're trapped in a very short amount of time.
Visibility may also be reduced by snow, moisture or ice on vehicle windows.
On the other hand, ice and snow conditions are normal in many countries, where traffic continues mostly without interruptions all year round.
Safaris are perhaps the biggest tourist attractions in Africa and a must-see for many visitors.
The term safari is widely used as the overland journey to visit the amazing African wildlife, especially the savannah.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to get very close to cars, and basic equipment will help with good visibility.
Lions, giraffes, and leopards are sometimes shy and are best seen through binoculars.
A bush walk (also called a bush walk or a hiking safari) consists of a hike of either a few hours or a few days.
The Paralympic Games will take place from 24 August to 5 September 2021, with some events held at other venues across Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to have hosted the Summer Olympics twice, having hosted them in 1964.
If you've made plans for how you'll fly and where you'll stay for 2020 before they're announced, you may be facing a difficult situation.
Cancellation policies vary, but as of late March most coronavirus cancellation policies are not extended to July 2020, when the Olympic Games were scheduled.
It is expected that most tickets for the events will cost from 2,500 yen to 130,000 yen, while the price of standard tickets is around 7,000 yen.
Many hotels have irons and irons for borrowing, even if they are not in the room.
If an iron is not available, or you are not interested in wearing ironed socks, you can use a scissor if available.
Care should be taken not to allow the tissue to overheat (which may cause shrinkage or, in extreme cases, burning).
There are several ways to purify water, and some are more effective against specific threats.
In some areas a minute of boiling water is enough, but in others several minutes are needed.
Filters vary in effectiveness, and if you have any concerns, you should consider buying your water in a sealed bottle from a reputable company.
Travellers may encounter infectious animals that they are not accustomed to encountering in areas of their country.
Pests spoil food, cause irritation or, in the worst cases, cause allergic reactions, carry poison and transmit infections.
Communicable diseases or wild animals that have the capacity to brutalize or kill humans are not often classified as pests.
Duty-free markets offer you the opportunity to obtain goods at specific locations without being burdened with customs duties and excise duties.
Travellers heading to high-tax countries can sometimes save quite a bit of money, especially on products such as spirits and tobacco.
The section between Point Marion and Fairmont is very dangerous to drive on the Buffalo-Pittsburg highway, because it crosses many lonely rural places.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, keep your eyes open: roads with big slopes, narrow lanes and steep turns are prevalent.
The posted speed limits are clearly lower than on previous and subsequent sections - usually 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h) - and it is even more important to obey them strictly.
Yet, strangely enough, the cell phone signal is much stronger here than along other sections of the trail, such as the Pennsylvania Wilderness.
The quality of German sweets is quite high, and Bavaria's variety and abundance are comparable to those of its southern neighbour Austria.
Fruit desserts usually include apples, from which desserts are made all year round, and cherries and plums, which appear in summer.
A large number of German baked goods also contain almonds, hazelnuts, and other nuts.
If you want a tasty little bread, try the so-called berliner, fankuchen, or krappen.

With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian food is an umbrella term that encompasses a wide variety of regional cuisines across the country.
But when used without other designations, the term tends to denote food from the central and eastern regions of the island of Java.

The suspensions are used as supports for the lower limbs of the rider and are held by the right and left sides of the saddle.
They provide greater stability to the rider, however they may present safety challenges due to the likelihood of the rider's feet getting stuck in them.
If a rider falls off the horse but his foot gets caught in the stirrup, the horse may drag him along the road as he runs.
First, most riders have special shoes that have heels, are soft, and have relatively short bottoms.
Then, some of the saddles, especially the English ones, have safety bars that allow a leather saddle to fall off if they are pulled backwards by the rider at the time of falling.

Snowsports, which include skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports that involve sliding down slopes covered by snow with skis or snowboards placed on your feet.
Skiing is a major travel activity with many enthusiasts, often called ski bums, planning entire ski vacations at a particular location.
The idea of skiing is very old, cave paintings depicting skiers dating back to 5,000 B.C.
Skiing as a sport dates back to the 17th century, and in 1861, the first ski club was founded in Australia by Norwegians.
Skiing: This activity is also called off-piste skiing, snowboarding, or ski mountaineering.
It is related to alpine skiing and mountaineering, but usually excludes them, as the latter are done on steep terrain and require much more hardcore skis and boots.
Think of the ski trail as a similar distance covered by hiking.
In ideal conditions you will be able to cover relatively longer distances than by walking - but very rarely will you reach the speeds of a bumpy road skier without a heavy backpack on the specially designed tracks.
Europe is a relatively small continent but has many independent countries.Under normal circumstances, visiting many countries during the trip would require visa applications and multiple passport controls.
The Schengen area, however, could be said to function as a single country in this respect.
While in this zone you are generally allowed to cross the border without going through passport controls again.
Similarly, if you have a Schengen visa, you do not have to apply for a visa in each of the Schengen area Member States, saving time, money and paperwork.
There is no universal definition of what constitutes an antique, but some tax authorities define antiques as goods that are over 100 years old.

Reindeer herding is an important occupation for the Sami, and the culture surrounding the trade is also important to many who are involved in other professions.
Even traditionally, of course, not all the Sami were involved in large-scale reindeer husbandry, but some made a living from fishing, hunting and other activities, using reindeer mainly as pets.
Today many Sami people work in modern trade. Tourism is an important source of income in Saami, the Sami region.

Surface currents are the returning currents of waves that run off the beach, often on a reef or something like that.
Due to the underwater topology, the return flows are concentrated in some deeper sections where strong currents may be generated at great depth.
Most deaths are caused by exhaustion from trying to swim against the current, which is not always possible.
With the power out, swimming to land won't be any harder than normal.
Try to aim at a spot where you've never been trapped before or, based on your skills and if you've been spotted, it might be better to wait to be rescued.

Your local telephone service provider should be able to give you more information on how to connect to this service.
One option that is becoming increasingly popular for those planning a gap year is to travel and learn.
It has particular appeal to school leavers, as it allows them to take a one-year break before starting university without jeopardising their education.

Usually, tuition is required to enroll in such training programs.
Finland is a great place for boating, and in the 'Land of a Thousand Lakes' you will find thousands of islands, both in the lakes and in the coastal archipelago.
The ship won't necessarily serve you in the archipelago and the lakes.
While the archipelago and the larger lakes are indeed big enough for any pleasure boat, the smaller boats or even kayaks provide an alternative experience.
Boating is a national hobby for Finland, with one boat for every seven or eight people.
This compares with Norway, Sweden and New Zealand but is generally very unique (e.g. in the Netherlands the ratio is one in forty).
Almost all private cruises in the Baltic include an extended stay in St. Petersburg, Russia.
This means that you can visit the historic city for a few full days while returning to sleep on the boat in the evening.
If you only get to the city via excursions organised by the ship, you will not need a separate visa (from 2009).
Some cruises include Berlin, Germany, in their advertising brochures. As shown in the map above, Berlin is not near the sea, and a visit to the city is not included in the price of the cruise.
Air travel can be considered a very frightening experience by people of all ages and backgrounds, especially if they have never flown before or have had a traumatic experience.

Courier companies are paid handsomely for the rapid delivery of goods. Quite often, time is an important factor when it comes to business documents, merchandise or spare parts for an urgent repair.
The larger companies have their own planes for some routes, but there are problems with other routes and smaller companies.
If they sent things by air freight, some flights might take days to unload and clear customs.
The only way to get it through faster would be to send it as checked baggage, because airline regulations won't allow them to send baggage without a passenger, and that's where your role begins.
The obvious way to fly first or business class is to pay a bunch of money for the privileged seat (or even better, ask your company to do it for you).
However, this does cost: as a general rule, you can expect to pay up to four times the normal economy fare for business class and eleven times for first class!
In general, there is no need to even look for discounts on business or first class seats on direct flights from A to B.
