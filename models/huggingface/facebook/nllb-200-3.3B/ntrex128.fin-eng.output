The Welsh Assemblymen are afraid of looking like fools .
Some Members of the House are confused by the proposal to change their title to MWP, Member of the Welsh Parliament.
The scandal was sparked by a plan to change the name of the representative body to the Welsh Parliament.
Members of the House of Representatives, regardless of party affiliation, are concerned that the change may make them the target of ridicule.
A Labour Party representative said the group was concerned that the name "Twp" was confused with "Pwp".
For readers outside Wales, in Welsh, twp means stupidity and pwp means poop.
A representative of the Plaid party said that the majority of the group was 'not satisfied' and had suggested other alternatives.
The Conservative Party spokesperson said that his group was "very happy" about the name change, but noted that the word "MWP" was a short verbal transition from "stupid" to "stupid".
In Welsh, the w is pronounced in this context similarly to the Yorkshire u.
The Delegation Committee, which is currently drafting the necessary legislative amendment for the change of name, stated the following: The final decision on the names of the members of the Delegation is, of course, up to the members themselves.
The 2017 Welsh Government Act empowers the Representation to change its name.
In June, the Commission published a survey of its proposals, which showed that there was broad support for the nomination of a representative body for the Welsh parliament.
The Commission favoured the Members of the Welsh Parliament or WMP as the nickname for members of the House of Representatives, but the MWP option was the most widely supported in the public opinion poll.
Members of the House of Representatives are apparently proposing alternative titles, but the lack of consensus could cause headache for Speaker Elin Jones, who is expected to propose amendments to the bill within a few weeks.
The amending legislation also includes other changes to the functioning of the delegation, such as the rules on the loss of representation and the format of the committee system.
In legislative proceedings, the members of the delegation can cast the final vote on what they should be called.
Macedonians go to the polls in a referendum to change the country's name
On Sunday, voters will vote on whether to change the country's name to the Republic of North Macedonia.
The referendum is intended to resolve a decades-long dispute with neighboring Greece, which also has its own province called Macedonia.
Athens has long maintained that the name of its northern neighbour is effectively a territorial claim to the territory it belongs to, and has repeatedly opposed its EU and NATO membership efforts.
The Macedonian president, Gjorge Ivanov, who opposes the referendum, has said he will ignore the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, such as Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the name change is simply the price to pay for EU and NATO membership.
The bells of St. Martin's are silent as the churches of Harlem are in trouble.
'The elderly people I've talked to say that there used to be a bar or a church on every street corner,' says Adams.
 Today there is neither.
He said the loss of the bars was understandable.
He said that "the way people interact has changed".
Bars are no longer the common living rooms of a neighbourhood where people meet regularly.
As for the churches, he is concerned that the sale of assets will not go as far as the leaders think, and sooner or later they will be back to square one.
He added that churches can be replaced by residential buildings and apartments, the people who occupy them are not the ones who would support the remaining sanctuaries in the neighborhood.
"The vast majority of people who buy apartments in these buildings will be white", he says, "and thus hasten the day when these churches will close their doors for good, because it is unlikely that most of the people who move into these apartments will become members of these churches".
Both churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black neighborhood - the Metropolitan Community in 1870 and St. Martins decades later.
The original white Methodist church moved out in the 1930's.
A nearby black congregation took possession of the building.
St. Martins was taken over by a black congregation led by the Reverend John Howard Johnson, who led a boycott of the 125th Street department store in Harlem against the black merchants who opposed the hiring or promotion of blacks.
In 1939 a fire severely damaged the building, and when Father Johnson's parishioners planned to rebuild, they used a tower bell.
The Rev. David Johnson, son of Father Johnson and his successor at St. Martins, proudly called the bell tower "the clock of the common people".
The expert who played the tower organ in July called it by another name: a cultural art and an irreplaceable historical instrument.
Tiffany Ng, an expert at the University of Michigan, also noted that it was the world's first tower bell played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who moved to play a larger tower bell at Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Merriweather says St. Martins never replaced him.
In recent months, a complex network has developed in St. Martins, involving, on the one hand, lay leaders of the church and, on the other, architects and contractors hired by the Episcopal diocese.
The German lay bishop's governing body wrote to the diocese in July expressing concern that the diocese would try to pay the costs to the German bishop's council, even though Germany had not participated in the hiring of architects and builders sent by the diocese.
Some congregants complained about a lack of transparency regarding the bishopric.
A shark has injured a 13-year-old lobster diver in California.
Authorities say a shark attacked a 13-year-old boy and injured him while he was diving in the lobster pool on the opening day of the California lobster season.
The attack took place at Beacon Beach in Encinitas just before 7 a.m.
Chad Hammel told San Diego KSWB-TV that he and his friends had been diving for about half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy screaming for help, and he and the group of others rushed to the boy to help him out of the water.
Hammel said that at first he thought the boy was just excited about catching the lobster, but then he realized he was shouting: "It was bitten!
I was bitten!'
Upon reaching the boy, Hammel says he noticed that his entire clavicle had been torn open.
"I told everyone to get out of the water, there's a shark in the water!" added Hammel.
The boy was airlifted to the Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where his condition is said to be critical.
The species of the shark that attacked us is unknown.
Lifeboat captain Larry Giles said at a media briefing that a shark had been spotted in the area a few weeks earlier, but was determined to be a harmless species.
Giles added the victim's severe injuries to his torso.
Authorities have closed the beaches from Casablad to Ponto Beach to Ecinitas Swami for 48 hours for research and safety reasons.
Giles noted that there are over 135 sharks in the area, but most of them are considered harmless.
Sainsbury's intends to bring the UK beauty industry
Sainsbury's is challenging Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with department-sized beauty departments staffed by expert consultants.
This is a significant move for the UK's £2.8 billion beauty industry, which continues to grow despite a slump in fashion and home goods sales.
Cosmetics are being invested because supermarkets are trying to fill the space on their shelves that was previously reserved for televisions, microwaves and home appliances.
Sainsbury's says its beauty lineup will double to 3,000 products, including brands like Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
Existing brands such as L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also be given more space and will have their own branded areas, like Boots stores.
The supermarket will also be re-launching its Boutique make-up range, with the majority of products being vegan-friendly as young shoppers increasingly demand it.
In addition, The Fragrance Shop, a perfume chain, is testing outlet stores in two Sainsbury's stores, the first of which opened last week in Croydon, south London, and the second one in Selly Oak, Birmingham, which will open later this year.
The shift from online shopping and grocery shopping to small-scale purchases in local shops is forcing supermarkets to invent new attractions for customers.
Sainsbury's CEO Mike Coupe has said that stores will look more like department stores as the supermarket chain battles with discount stores like Aldi and Lidl by adding services and nonfood items.
Since buying both chains two years ago, Sainsbury's has opened hundreds of Argos stores in its stores, as well as Habitat stores, which the company says has helped boost food sales and made purchases more profitable.
The supermarket failed in its previous attempt to revamp its beauty and pharmacy departments.
Sainsbury's experimented with a joint venture with Boots in the early 2000s, but the partnership ended in a dispute over how the revenues of the pharmacies located in supermarkets should be divided.
The new strategy follows a corporate takeover in which Sainsbury's sold its 281 store pharmacy business to Lloyds Pharmacy's owner Celesio for £125 million three years ago.
The company said Lloyds is part of a plan to expand into four stores a line of luxury skin care products with brands like La Roche-Posay and Vichy.
Said Sainsbury's commercial director Paul Mills-Hicks: "We have changed the look and feel of our beauty departments to enhance the customer experience.
We have also invested in highly trained staff who are ready to advise clients.
Our brand portfolio meets all needs, and our attractive environment and convenient location make us a compelling beauty care shopping destination that challenges the traditional way of shopping.
Peter Jones in a rage after Holly Willoughby pulled out of an £11 million deal
Dragons Den star Peter Jones left in a fit of anger after TV presenter Holly Willoughby pulled out of her £11 million contract with her lifestyle brand to focus on her new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby doesn't have time for their home-grown food and clothing brand, Truly.
The two companies have been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand.
The 37-year-old former co-host of This Morning has announced his departure on Instagram.
Holly Willoughby, who angered Dragons Den star Peter Jones by withdrawing from their lucrative lifestyle business at the last minute, is now set to focus on her new retainer deals with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources say Jones was 'outraged' last Tuesday at a tense emotional meeting at the headquarters of Jones' business empire in Marlowe, Buckinghamshire, after the TV star admitted that her new £1.5 million deal would not leave enough time for their food and clothing brand Trully.
The company has been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand and was bet on doubling Willoughby's estimated £11 million fortune.
After Willoughby, 37, announced on Instagram that he was leaving Truly, Jones flew from Britain to one of his vacation homes.
According to one source, "Truly was clearly Holly's most important project.
It was his long-range plan to ensure his livelihood for the next two decades.
His initial decision has left everyone in awe.
No one had believed Tuesday's events so close to publication.
Marlowe's headquarters has a warehouse full of products waiting to be sold.
The This Morning presenter is one of Britain's most trusted stars, and experts say his departure could cost the company millions of pounds due to product investments that include everything from pillows to candles and clothing to home supplies, not to mention delaying publication.
It could mean the end of a long friendship.
Mother of three children, Willoughby and her husband, Dan Baldwin, have been close to Jones and his wife, Tara Capp, for the past ten years.
Willoughby organized Cappin Truly in 2016, and Jones, 52, took over as chairman in March.
The couples are on vacation together, and Jones owns 40% of Baldwin's TV production company.
Willoughby is being promoted to be the new brand ambassador for M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin as the host of ITV's I'm A Celebrity.
A source close to Jones said the night before, "We have no comment on his business".
♪ And then we fell in love ♪
He joked about the criticism he would receive in the media for his comments, which some would consider inappropriate for the president, and his approval of the leader of North Korea.
Why has President Trump given up so much?
Trump said, pretending to be a news anchor.
I didn't give up a single inch.
He noted that Kim was keen to meet again after Trump hailed the first meeting in July as a major step towards North Korean denuclearisation.
But the nuclear talks have stalled.
More than three months after the Singapore summit in July, North Korean top diplomat Ri Yong Ho told world leaders at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that the North does not see a "response" from the US to North Korea's early weapons-launching efforts.
The European Union must not allow the European Union to be the sole arbiter of the future of the European Union.
Trump had a much more optimistic view in his speech.
"We're doing great with North Korea", he said.
We were getting into a war with North Korea.
Millions of people would have died.
Now we have this great relationship.
He said that efforts to improve relations with Kim have produced positive results, including the termination of missile tests, the release of hostages and the repatriation of the remains of American soldiers.
He also defended his unusual style in speaking about his relationship with Kim.
"It's very easy to be president, but instead of going out into this crowded hall trying to get 10,000 more, we'd have about 200 people standing right there", Trump said, pointing to the audience directly in front of him.
The Indonesian tsunami and earthquake devastated the island, hundreds died
For example, in the aftermath of the Lombok earthquake, several foreign volunteer organizations were told that they were not needed.
A national emergency, which required international assistance, was not declared, although some 10 percent of Lombok's residents had been rendered homeless.
In many cases, unfortunately, they have made it very clear that they are not asking for international help, so the situation is a bit of a challenge, said Sumbung.
Although Save the Children is part of the team that will be travelling to Palau, it is not clear whether foreign staff will be able to work on the field.
Sutopo, a spokesman for the National Disaster Management Agency, said that Indonesian authorities were assessing the situation in Pulau to see if international organizations would be allowed to participate in the relief effort.
Indonesia remains unfortunately unprepared to face the forces of nature, given the regular occurrence of earthquakes.
Although tsunami shelters have been built on Aceh, they are still rare in other coastal areas.
The loss of life on the return was probably due to the absence of a tsunami warning siren, even though the warning was in effect.
Travel between the many islands of Indonesia is challenging even under the best of circumstances.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated.
A hospital ship sent to Lombok to help earthquake victims is on its way to Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the new disaster area.
President Joko Widodo made the development of Indonesia's dilapidated infrastructure a focal point of his election campaign, and he has poured money into improving roads and railways.
However, the governance of the river has been hampered by a funding gap as new elections are approaching next year.
Adding to the pressures of the river are the tensions between religious groups in Indonesia, where the country's Muslim majority adheres to a more conservative form of religion.
Street battles between Christian and Muslim gangs with machetes, bows and arrows, and other primitive weapons have resulted in over 1,000 deaths and tens of thousands displaced.
Watch as Liverpool 's Daniel Sturridge sinks the late equaliser against Chelsea .
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from defeat in the Premier League on Saturday after scoring in the 89th minute at Stamford Bridge in London.
Sturridge had a no-hitter from Xherdan Shaqiri with 27 minutes to play against Chelsea, as his team were in the goal-line.
He moved the ball to the left before he got a terrible shot to the back of the head.
The shot was flown high over the penalty area towards the right upper corner.
Finally, the ball passed over the thrower, Kepa Arrizabalaga, and landed in the net.
"I was just trying to make myself playable to get the ball and players like Shaq always play as high up as possible, so I was just trying to create as much time for myself as possible", Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
I saw Kanten coming, I took one touch and fired without thinking twice.
Chelsea took the lead at half-time, 1-0 after Belgium's Eden Hazard scored in the 25th minute.
The Blues' forward gave Mateo Kovacic a corner kick to put him in the game, before he spun out near the centre and sputtered Liverpool to half-time.
Kovacic was playing a fastball in the middle of the field.
Then he released Hazard into the penalty area with a great pass.
Hazard escaped the defence and overtook Liverpool's Alisson Becker with a shot to the left leg in the back corner.
Liverpool will face the Champions League in the group stage in Naples on Wednesday at 3pm at the San Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will play UEFA Europa League at the Videotron on Thursday at 3pm in London.
The death toll from the Indonesian tsunami rises to 832
Indonesia's disaster agency reported early Sunday that the death toll from the earthquake and tsunami had risen to 832.
Agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo told a press conference that many were trapped in the rubble of collapsed buildings after a 7.5-magnitude earthquake struck Friday, raising waves up to six meters high.
The debris from the collapsed buildings spread widely over the city of Pull, with a population of 380,000.
Police arrested a 32-year-old man on suspicion of murder after finding a woman stabbed to death
The discovery of a woman's body in the Merseyside area of Birkenhead this morning has sparked a murder investigation.
A 44-year-old woman was found stabbed at 7:55 a.m. at Grayson Mews on John Street, and a 32-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of murder.
Police are asking anyone who was in the area to report if they saw or heard anything.
Police Commissioner Brian O'Hagan said: 'The investigation is still in its early stages, but I would urge anyone in the vicinity of John Street in Birkenhead to contact the police if they have seen or heard anything.
I also urge everyone, especially taxi drivers, who may have recorded something on a dashboard video, to contact the police, as they may have information vital to the investigation.
A female police spokesperson has confirmed that the woman found dead is from Birkenhead and that the body was found inside the property.
This afternoon, several people who may know the woman have arrived at the crime scene, asking where she was found.
As the investigation continues, the police say they are trying to inform the victim's relatives of what happened.
The cab driver, Grayson Mews, had just tried to get back to his apartment, but the police had told him that no one was allowed in or out of the building.
He was speechless when he learned what had happened.
Residents have just learned that it may be hours before they are allowed back in.
One officer was overheard telling a man that the entire area is being treated as a crime scene at this time.
A woman appeared at the scene with tears in her eyes.
He kept saying, "That's terrible".
By 2:00 p.m., there were two Mayas in the isolated area, and a third outside.
In the isolated area, there were several policemen guarding the apartment building.
Anyone with information is asked to send a message to @MerPolCC, dial 101 or anonymously call the Crimestoppers number 0800 555 111 using the code 247 on September 30.
The Cromwell statue in Parliament was also part of the rewrite of history.
The statue's removal would be poetic justice, considering that her own fanatical Puritan followers destroyed England's cultural and religious relics like the best Taliban.
However, the Cromwell Society described Crick's proposal as a 'dumbing down' and a 'rewrite of history'.
Cromell Society president John Goldsmith said: "It was inevitable that the ongoing debate about the removal of the statues would make the centrepiece the statue of Oliver Cromwell in front of the Palace of Westminster.
Cromwell did not order or carry out the iconoclasm of the English Civil Wars.
The false Cromwell might suffer for the actions of his ancestor Thomas, who lived in the previous century.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft's magnificent depiction of Cromwell reflects the views of the 19th century and is historical evidence of a character still held in high esteem by many.
Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Many, though perhaps more in the 19th century than today, see Cromwell as the defender of Parliament against external pressure, which in this case was of course inflicted by the monarchy.
Whether this is an accurate depiction of the subject is a matter of ongoing historical debate.
It is certain that the mid-17th century controversy has shaped the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell, for his part, is a recognizable figure representing the other side of that divide.
Moreover, his achievements as a steward deserve to be praised and remembered.
The killer whacked a Chinese farmer to death.
Local media reports say a pig attacked and killed a farmer in a market in southwest China.
The body of a man identified only by his surname Yuan was found near a pig in Liupanshu Market in Guizhou province, with a severed artery and covered in blood, the South China Morning Post reported Sunday.
A pig farmer prepares to vaccinate pigs in a pig pen on 30 May 2005 in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
He was reported to have traveled with his cousin from nearby Yunnan Province on Wednesday with the intention of selling 15 pigs at the market.
His cousin found him dead the next morning, and he also noticed that the door to the nearest pig farm was unlocked.
In the pigsty, he said he saw a big cow with blood in its mouth.
According to the news, a forensic investigation has confirmed that a 250-pound beetle killed a farmer.
The Guiyang Evening News reports that a cousin named Wu said that my cousin's legs were bloody and bruised.
CCTV shows the cousin arriving at the market to feed the pigs at 4:40 on Thursday morning.
His body was found about an hour later.
The pig that killed the man was not Yuan's or his cousin's.
One of the officials at the market told the Evening News that the pig had been locked away so that it would not harm others as police gathered evidence at the scene.
The Yuan family and the market authorities are reportedly negotiating compensation for the death.
Pigs have been known to attack humans before, although this is rare.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on their farm in the state of Massachusetts, causing severe injuries to the husband.
Ten years earlier, a 300-pound pig had herded a Welsh farmer against his tractor until his wife managed to chase the animal away.
After the incident, a farmer in Manitoba told CBC News that while pigs are not normally aggressive, the taste of blood can be a trigger.
They're just playing.
They are like little children, very curious, and they are not meant to hurt.
They just have to be respected properly, he said.
The remnants of Hurricane Rosa bring extensive heavy rains to the southwestern United States
Hurricane Rosa is weakening as predicted as it moves over the cooler waters off the northern coast of Mexico.
However, in the coming days, Rosa will bring floodwaters to northern Mexico and the southwestern United States.
At 5 a.m. Eastern Standard Time on Sunday, Rosa had winds of 125 feet per second, or 125 feet per second, a category one hurricane, and was located about 400 miles [620 km] southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
The roses are expected to move north on Sunday.
At the same time, a low pressure area is forming over the Pacific Ocean, moving eastward toward the west coast of the United States, and as Rosa arrives on the California mainland on Monday as a tropical storm, it will begin to push deep, tropical moisture northward into the southwestern United States.
On Monday, Rosa will bring up to eight inches [25 mm] of rain to some parts of Mexico.
Then, in the coming days, tropical moisture, interacting with the approaching low pressure, will form vast rain forests in the southwest.
Locally, 25-100 millimeters of rainfall will cause dangerous heavy rainstorms and possibly landslides in the desert.
Deep tropical moisture causes rainfall of 50-75 millimeters per hour in certain areas of the basin, especially in Nevada and Arizona.
Some areas in the southwest, particularly Arizona, are expected to receive up to 50 to 100 millimeters of rain.
Heavy flooding is possible and conditions may deteriorate rapidly due to the fragmentation of tropical rain.
If tropical rain is imminent, it is strongly recommended that you avoid the wilderness on foot.
Torrential rains can turn canyons into flowing rivers, and thunderstorms create local gusts of wind and flying dust.
The approaching low-lying area will bring local heavy rain to the coastal areas of Southern California.
Rainfall of over 10 millimeters is possible, causing small flows of sewage and slippery roads.
It would be the first rains of the rainy season in the region.
Scattered tropical rains begin approaching Arizona late on Sunday and early on Monday, until the rains expand during Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rains will spread to the Four Corners on Tuesday and continue through Wednesday.
In October, the United States is experiencing strong temperature swings as the Arctic cools but the tropics remain fairly warm.
This sometimes causes large temperature fluctuations over short distances.
A prime example of this is the large temperature differences seen in the central United States on Sundays.
There's a temperature difference of almost 20 degrees between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, and Nebraska, St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
The lingering heat of summer will again seek to strengthen and expand in the coming days.
The beginning of October is expected to be warm across much of the central and eastern United States, with temperatures of +26 degrees from the southern plains to the northeastern portions.
In New York, temperatures could soar to 26 degrees on Tuesday, which would be about four degrees warmer than average.
Our long-term forecast indicates that the eastern United States has a good chance of above-average temperatures in the first half of October.
Over 20 million people watched Brett Kavanaugh's hearing
More than 20 million watched Tuesday's broadcast on Channel 6 of Supreme Court Justice-elect Brett Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, who is accusing him of sexual misconduct in the 1980s, giving fascinating testimony.
Meanwhile, political gridlock continues as the television networks cut their broadcasts at the last minute to allow the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation into the allegations under a deal brokered by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that he was 100% sure that a drunken Kavanaugh had groped him and tried to strip him naked at a high school party.
Kavanaugh, for his part, gave a heartfelt statement saying he was 100% sure this didn't happen.
The number of viewers was probably higher than the 20.4 million Nielsen reported on Friday.
The company also calculated the average viewership for CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The other channels that broadcast the event, such as PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network, were not immediately available.
In addition, Nielsen often has difficulty measuring the viewers who watch in offices.
Something about the scale tells us that the number is equivalent to the attendance of a football playoff or the Oscars.
Of all the television companies, Nielsen said the Fox News Channel, whose opinion leaders have strongly supported Kavanaugh's nomination, had the highest viewership, averaging 5.69 million viewers during the day-long hearing.
ABC was second with 3.26 million viewers.
Nielsen reported that CBS had 3.1 million viewers, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 89 million, and CNN had 2.52 million.
After the hearing, interest remained high.
Friday's drama was centered on Flake.
CNN and CBS cameras filmed him being escorted by protesters shouting into an elevator as he was taken to a hearing by the Judiciary Committee on Friday, after Republican backers in Malta had previously announced he would vote for Kavanaugh.
CNN showed live how he stood there for a minute, staring down at the flies.
"I'm standing right in front of you", said one woman.
Do you believe he'll tell the people the truth?
"You have power, when so many women are powerless", she was told.
Flake said his office had given a statement and added before the elevator doors closed that he would have more to say after the committee's hearing.
Hours later, cable and public broadcast networks broadcast live as the Judiciary Committee began voting to bring Kavanaugh's nomination to a vote in the Senate plenary.
But Flake said he would only act on the understanding that the FBI would investigate the charges against the candidate next week, as Democrats in the minority have demanded.
Flake was convinced in part by conversations he had with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
Flake made his decision after consulting with Coons and several other senators.
Flake's choice was a powerful one, because it was clear that the Republicans would not have enough votes to approve Kavanaugh without an investigation.
President Trump has launched an FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of politicizing Brexit
In an interview with the Sunday Times, Prime Minister Theresa May accuses those who criticise her EU plans of politics that threaten Britain's future and national interests.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives for the Conservative Party meeting in Birmingham, UK, on 29 September 2018.
Alongside May's interview, another interview was published on the front page, in which her former foreign secretary Boris Johnson continued his attack on May's so-called Chequers plan, calling the proposal that Britain and the EU would impose tariffs on each other "totally absurd".
Police arrested Dyteon Simpson on suspicion of causing the death of an LSU player.
Police have arrested a suspect in connection with the shooting death of 20-year-old Wayde Sims, who was playing basketball at LSU.
Twenty-year-old Dyteon Simpson has been arrested and taken to the Baton Rouge Police Department, where he is being charged with second-degree murder.
Authorities released video footage of the Sims-Simpson encounter, in which the police officer says that Sims lost his glasses.
Police found the glasses at the scene and said they found Simpson's DNA on them, according to WAFB.
The police say Simpson confessed to shooting Wade during interrogation.
According to Advocate magazine, his bail was set at $350,000.
The East Baton Rouge County Coroner's Office released a preliminary report Friday that the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the neck.
The agency would like to thank the Louisiana State Police Task Force, the Louisiana State Police Crime Lab, the Southern University Police Department, and the residents of the area for their assistance in the investigation that led to the arrest.
LSU athletic director Joe Alleva thanked law enforcement for their "dedication and commitment to justice".
Sims was 20 years old.
The 6-foot-7 forward grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball at LSU.
He averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game last season.
LSU basketball coach Will Wade said Friday morning that he was "appalled and shocked" by Wade's death.
"You're always afraid something like this will happen", Wayde said.
A volcano spews ash over Mexico City
Ash from the Popocatepetl volcano has reached the southern neighborhoods of Mexico City.
On Saturday, Mexico's National Disaster Management Center urged citizens to stay away from the volcano as the crater's activity intensified, with 183 gas and ash eruptions recorded in 24 hours.
The center is registering a number of shakes and tremors.
Images were posted on social media showing car windshields in residential areas such as Xochimilco, Mexico City, covered with a thin layer of ash.
Geophysicists have detected an increase in activity at a volcano 45 miles (72 kilometers) southwest of the capital after a magnitude 7.1 earthquake rocked Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano known as Don Goyo has been active since 1994.
Police and Catalan separatists clash before the anniversary of the independence referendum
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday in clashes between pro-independence protesters and riot police, as thousands took part in competing demonstrations on the first anniversary of the split-section referendum.
Police were holding up a group of masked pro-independence supporters who threw eggs and a powdered paint that formed dark clouds of dust on the normally crowded streets.
As the day wore on, more riots broke out as police used their cartridges to control the rioters.
The clashes between pro-independence and unionist groups continued for several hours, with the former shouting 'no forgetfulness, no forgiveness' and the latter 'see you in Spain'.
Local media reports that 14 people have been treated for minor injuries sustained during the protests.
Tension is still high in the pro-independence area a year after the October 1 referendum, which Madrid declared illegal but which Catalan separatists celebrated.
Voters voted for independence by a clear majority, although turnout was low in contrast to the boycott of the vote by opponents.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured in violent clashes last year when police tried to prevent voting at polling stations across the region.
Pro-independence groups stayed out on Friday night to prevent a demonstration in support of the national police.
The demonstration was organized, but it had to go another way.
Narcis Termes, a 68-year-old electrician who participated in the separatist demonstration with his wife, said he was no longer optimistic about Catalan independence.
"Last year we had one of the best moments of our lives".
I saw my parents crying with joy when they could vote, but now we are stuck in our seats", she says.
Despite the narrow but vital victory in the regional elections last December, the momentum of the pro-independence parties in Catalonia has been waning this year, with many of its most prominent leaders in voluntary exile or detained pending trial for their involvement in the organisation of the referendum and the subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who filmed the pro-police demonstration with his cell phone, says that the political parties on both sides have been feeding off the controversy.
'The situation is getting worse,' he says.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders held in pre-trial detention since last year, announced that he would run in next year's European Parliament elections.
'Becoming a candidate for the European elections is the best way to condemn the crumbling of democratic values and the oppression we have seen from the Spanish government,' she says.
Londonderry: Men arrested after car crashes into house
The men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested after a car was reportedly driven into a house in Londonderry.
The events took place in Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at approximately 7:30 p.m. British time.
Detective Chief Constable Bob Blemmings said the gates and the building were damaged.
The car may have been shot at with a crossbow.
Livingston beat the Rangers 1-0 with a goal from Menga.
Dolly Menga's first goal in Livingston sealed the victory.
The series-ending Livingston stunned Rangers and caused Steven Gerrard to suffer his second defeat in 18 games as manager of the Ibrox club.
Dolly Mengan's goal finally paid off as Gary Holt's team moved up to a tie for second place with Hibernian.
Gerrard's side have missed out on their first away win of the season in the Premiership, and next Sunday they will face the champions, Hearts, who are eight points clear of the title.
Rangers will face Rapid Vienna in the Europa League on Thursday.
Livingston, on the other hand, continues his unbeaten streak in the series to six games, while head coach Holt has yet to lose a game since replacing Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston wasted places for lack of steel suffered visitor to the counter
Holt should have been leading the team long before he scored and caused Rangers a bad problem with his directness.
Scott Robinson broke through, but the finish was wide, and then Alan Lithgow slipped through the net to Craig Halkett's fumble, but he passed the ball.
The owners willingly gave up control of the ball to the Rangers because they knew they could vaccinate for special occasions.
The big goal came just like this.
The Rangers gave Livingston a free throw, which Declan Gallagher and Robinson used to play for Menga, who was able to move the ball to the center of the penalty area and finish.
The Rangers had the ball by then, but the home team's defense was holding, and goalkeeper Liam Kelly was barely allowed to practice.
The same pattern continued in the second half, despite the efforts of Alfredo Morelos to force Kelly to fight back.
Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor blocked Scott Pittman's attempt and Lithgow steered the ball past another of Livingston's special situations.
The foul balls that landed in the Livingston penalty area were continually being cleaned out, and two unnecessary penalties were called for - the penalty for Halkett's tackling of the substitute Glenn Middleton and the penalty for the ball hitting his hand.
A great performance from Livingston .

A great performance and a great result from Livingston.
The team continued to exceed expectations and was excellent with every player, continuing through the ups and downs.
The team's style of play and crew have changed little since their return to the top flight.However, Holt has to be credited with the way he has strengthened the squad since his arrival.
He had many heroes.
Captain Halkett was a sensation leading a well-organized defense, with Mengan keeping Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall on his toes the entire match.
The Rangers were short on ideas, though.
The team has performed very well at times under Gerrard, but now fell far short of his standard.
The last inning was a drain, and they only managed to open up the home team's defense once, which should be a wake-up call for the Rangers, who are the middle-of-the-line in the standings.
Erdogan received a mixed reception in Cologne .
On 29 September, smiles were bright and the sky was blue as the leaders of Turkey and Germany met for breakfast in Berlin.
It's the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, which is aimed at repairing relations between the NATO allies.
There have been differences over human rights and freedom of the press, as well as over Turkey's EU aspirations.
Erdogan continued on to Cologne to open a gigantic new mosque.
The city has the largest population of Turks outside Turkey.
Police stopped the 25,000-strong crowd of supporters from gathering in front of the mosque, citing security reasons, but many still gathered nearby to watch the president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters, many of them Kurds, also raised their voices, condemning both Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to invite him to the country.
The competing demonstrations reflect a split of opinion, with some Turks in Germany hailing him as a hero, while others denounce him as an autocrat.
A cyclist dies after colliding with a car in Deptford.
A cyclist has died after being hit by a car in London.
The accident occurred at about ten o'clock local time in the southwest part of Deptford, near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, where there is heavy traffic.
The driver of the car stopped and the paramedics came to the victim's aid, but the man died at the scene.
A few months earlier, another cyclist was killed in a hit-and-run accident on Childers Street, about a mile from the scene of Saturday's accident.
The city police say they're working to identify the man and notify his loved ones.
There are road closures in place and buses have been diverted and motorists are advised to avoid the area.
Long Lart Prison Six guards were injured during the riot
Prison officials report six prison guards were injured in the high-security prison riots.
The riots began at the HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire at about 9:30 a.m. on Sunday, British time, and are still going on.
Tornado special forces have been brought in to quell unrest, with eight inmates in a prison crew.
The officers' minor facial injuries were treated at the scene.
A prison administration spokesman said: "HMP Long Lartin has sent specially trained prison staff to deal with the situation.
Six members of the staff have been treated for their injuries.
We do not condone violence in our prisons and it is clear that those responsible will be taken into police custody and may have to spend longer behind bars.
HMP Long Lartin has over 500 prisoners, including some of the country's most dangerous criminals.
The prison warden was reportedly hospitalized in June after being attacked by an inmate.
In addition, riot police were called to the prison in October because of serious disturbances, in which staff were attacked with billiard balls.
Hurricane Rosa threatens to bring severe flooding to Phoenix, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City (dry areas may benefit)
Tropical storms rarely make landfall in Arizona, but that's exactly what's happening early next week as the remnants of Hurricane Rosa move across the southwestern desert, bringing with it the risk of severe flooding.
The National Weather Service has already issued a severe thunderstorm warning for Monday and Tuesday from western Arizona to southern and eastern Nevada, southeast California and Utah, as well as the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
The meteor shower is expected to move directly over Phoenix on Tuesday, arriving on Monday in the form of rain.
The Phoenix National Weather Service tweeted that only "Ten tropical cyclones have maintained tropical storm or low pressure status within 200 miles [300 km] of Phoenix since 1950!
Hurricane Katrina (1967) was still 40 miles from the Arizona border.
The latest National Hurricane Center forecasts are between 50 and 100 millimeters of rain, and in some areas, up to 150 millimeters on the Mogollin Range in Arizona.
Other areas of the southwestern desert, including the central rocky mountains and the Great Basin, are producing 25 to 50 milliliters, totaling up to 100 millimeters.
The dew can also be a blessing in a drought-stricken area, where there is no danger of heavy rainfall.
Although flooding poses a serious threat, some of the rain may also be beneficial, since the southwest has suffered from severe drought.
According to the U.S. Bureau of Drought, more than 40 percent of Arizona is experiencing at least extreme drought, the second highest category, reports weather.com.
Hurricane Rosa will make its first landfall on the California Peninsula in Mexico.
As of Sunday morning, Rosa is located 620 miles south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, at the peak of its hurricane strength, with winds of 135 miles per hour, and is moving north at 20 miles per hour.
The storm will lose strength as it encounters cooler waters in the Pacific.
It is therefore expected to reach Mexico as a tropical storm early Monday afternoon or evening.
In parts of Mexico, the rains can be heavy and pose a significant flood risk.
"We're expecting 75 to 150 millimeters of rain from the California peninsula to northwest Sonora, and up to 250 millimeters is possible", says weather.com.
Rosa then continues its journey across Mexico as a tropical storm before arriving at the Arizona border as a tropical depression on Tuesday morning, from where it continues its journey across Arizona into southern Utah by late Tuesday night.
"The greatest risks to Rosa or its remnants are associated with very heavy rainfall in the California peninsula, northwest Sonora, and the southwestern desert of the United States", says the National Hurricane Center.
These rains are expected to cause life-threatening heavy rains and waste streams in deserts, as well as landslides in mountainous regions.
Midsomer Norton assault: four arrested for attempted murder
Three teenage boys and a 20-year-old man have been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old boy was found stabbed in Somerset.
A teenage boy was found wounded in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton at 4am on Saturday, British time.
He was taken to a hospital where he is reported to be in "stable" condition.
Police say they arrested a 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old in the Radstock area of Avon and Somerset overnight.
Police are asking anyone with a cell phone that may have video of the events to come forward.
Trump says Kavanaugh has experienced the "pride and rage" of the Democratic Party.
"To vote for Judge Kavanaugh is to vote against the Democratic Party's ruthless and shameful methods", Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh suffered from the Democratic Party's "hatred and anger" throughout his nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, strongly and emotionally denying the allegations made by Christine Blasey Ford of sexual harassment that occurred decades ago in their teenage years.
Ford also testified at the hearing.
On Saturday, the president said that "Americans saw the excellence, character and courage of Kavanaugh that day".
"As a vote in favor of confirming Judge Kavanaugh's nomination, I am voting for one of the most accomplished jurists of our time, with an outstanding record of public service", he told a crowd of supporters in West Virginia.
The president was referring indirectly to Kavanaugh's appointment when he spoke of the importance of Republican turnout in the midterm elections.
We're five weeks away from the most important election of our lives.
"I'm not just campaigning, I'm campaigning full-on", he said.
That's why I go around fighting for the best candidates.
Trump claimed that the Democrats had taken the mission of "resist and prevent".
A senior aide to the Republican leadership told CNN that the first important vote on Kavanaugh's nomination is expected in the Senate no later than Friday.
Hundreds dead in Indonesian earthquake and tsunami, death toll expected to rise
Authorities on Saturday reported at least 384 dead after a major earthquake and tsunami struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, sweeping many away with giant waves that washed ashore.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a festival on the city's beach Friday as waves as high as 20 feet [6 m] crashed into the beach at dusk, with many washing up dead as the waves destroyed everything in their path.
The tsunami was caused by a 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
When the tsunami threat emerged yesterday, people were still huddling on the beach, not immediately fleeing, leaving them to be victimized, says Purwo Nugroho, spokesperson for Indonesia's National Disaster Mitigation Bureau (BNPB) in Jakarta.
"The tsunami did not come alone, but it dragged cars, logs, houses and hit everywhere on land", says Nugroho, adding that the tsunami reached 500 miles per hour [800 km/ hr] in the open ocean before hitting the coast.
Some people survived the tsunami by climbing trees, he says.
Some 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centers in Palos.
Aerial photographs released by the disaster agency show several destroyed houses and shops, twisted and collapsed bridges, and a mosque surrounded by water.
The aftershocks continued to shake the coastal city Saturday.
The earthquakes were felt in an area of 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian Bureau for Technology Assessment and Application (BPPT) issued a statement that the energy released by Friday's massive earthquake was equivalent to about 200 atomic bombs dropped on Hiroshima in World War II.
It says that the city's terrain, at the end of a long and narrow bay, could have been swollen by the tsunami.
Nugroho described the destruction as "vast" and said that thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels had collapsed.
He said that some of the bodies of the victims were found in the rubble of collapsed buildings, adding that 540 people had been injured and 29 were missing.
Nugroho said that the death toll and damage may be greater than Palma's 300 kilometers north of the coast, in an area called Donggala, which is closer to the epicenter of the quake.
"Communications are completely cut off and no information has been received from Donggala", Nugroho said.
The Red Cross said in a statement that more than 300,000 people live there, adding that its staff and volunteers were on their way to the area.
'This is already a tragedy, but it could become much worse,' he said.
The agency was widely criticized on Saturday for not reporting the tsunami that hit the island, although officials said the waves came during the warning.
In an amateur video shared on social media, a man on the upper floors of a building is loudly shouting warnings of an impending tsunami to people on the street.
Minutes later, a wall of water hits the beach, sweeping away buildings and cars.
Reuters was not able to verify the authenticity of the footage at first.
The earthquake and tsunami caused widespread power outages that cut communications around the city of Paya, making it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue efforts.
Officials say that the army has begun sending relief from Jakarta and other cities by airlift, but the evacuees still desperately need food and other basic supplies.
The city's airport has been reopened for relief purposes only and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo was scheduled to visit the Plu evacuation centers on Sunday.
The death toll from the Indonesian tsunami has now risen to over 800.
This is a very bad situation.
World Vision Donggala staff have reached safety in the city of Pyeongchang, where they are housed in tented gas sheds in the courtyard of the office, and on their way they passed the scene of the destruction, Doseba said.
"They told me they saw a lot of destroyed houses", he says.
This is a very bad situation.
As relief groups began their desperate mission, some complained that foreign aid workers were being prevented from traveling to Palu.
According to Indonesian regulations, foreign funding, supplies and personnel can only start flowing after the disaster area has been declared a national disaster area.
This hasn't happened yet.
"It is still a provincial disaster", says Aulia Arriani, a spokeswoman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
"Once the government says, 'OK, this is a national disaster,' we can start receiving international aid, but the declaration has not been made yet".
As the second night fell over the city of Ply after Friday's earthquake and tsunami, friends and family members of the missing held out hope that their loved ones would be spared the dark tale of natural disasters by the miracle trade.
On Saturday, a little boy was pulled from the sewers.
On Sunday, rescue workers freed a woman who had been in the rubble for two days next to her mother's body.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of the Indonesian national team, had trained two missing athletes for the Asian Games, which ended earlier this month.
Mandagi says that his students were trapped in the Roa Roa Hotel.
'As a senior member of the Dependent Union, I have my own emotional burden,' she says.
Gendon says he was desperate to reach out to the beach festival's Pulu competitors with WhatsApp messages after news of the Roa Roa hotel collapse spread through the beach festival community.
However, the messages he sent were followed by only one grey sign instead of two blue ones.
'I take it that means that the messages were not delivered,' he says.
Thieves took $26,750 from an ATM replenishment in Newport on the Levee.
Thieves stole $26,750 from a Brink's security guard who was filling an ATM machine in Newport on the Leve on Friday morning, according to a news release from the Newport Police Department.
The driver of the car had been emptying and refilling the ATM machine at the entertainment center, Detective Dennis McCarthy said in a news release.
While the Brink's worker was distracted, he was pursued by a man who stole a bag of money to be delivered.
According to the report, witnesses saw several people fleeing the scene, but the police did not specify their number.
Anybody with information on their identities is asked to contact Newport Police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper changes his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West is changing his name to Ye.
Announcing the change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: a character formerly known as Kanye West.
Ye has been a nickname for 41-year-old West for some time, and he also used it as the title of his eighth album, which was released in June.
The change comes ahead of her upcoming appearance on Saturday Night Live, where she is expected to release her new album, Yandhi.
She replaces singer Ariana Grande, who, according to the show's creator, cancelled her participation for "sexual reasons".
West has previously said that the word has a religious meaning for him, in addition to being an abbreviation of his professional name.
In discussing the album's title earlier this year with radio host Big Boy, West said, "I believe that 'ye' is the most common word in the Bible, and there its meaning is 'you'".
So I'm you, I'm us, and I'm all of us.
It started with "Kany", which means "unique", and ended up in the short form of "Ye", which is just an expression of the goodness, the evil, the confusion, everything that's in us.
The album is more like a reflection on who we are.
He's one of several famous rappers who have changed their name.
Sean Combs has been known variously as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he announced his preferred names are Love and Brother Love.
West's former collaborator, JAY-Z, has also occasionally deleted and restored the hyphen and capital letters.
AMLO of Mexico promises not to use the military against civilians
President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador of Mexico has pledged never to use military force against civilians, as the country approaches the 50th anniversary of the student uprising.
Lopez Obrador, who was speaking at the Tlatelolco Plaza on Saturday, promised that "the military will never be used to repress the Mexican people".
Armed forces opened fire on a peaceful demonstration on October 2, 1968, killing up to 300 people at a time when leftist student movements were taking root in Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has promised to support young Mexicans by offering monthly tuition and opening more free public universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities were driving young people into criminal gangs.
The Joint Research Centres should double funding for AI research
The United States should double its funding for AI research as China ramps up its efforts in the field, says Kai-Fu Lee, a funder and AI expert who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The statement was preceded by briefings on AI from various parts of the US administration, despite the lack of a formal AI strategy in the US.
Meanwhile, China announced its plans last year to become the leading AI developer by 2030.
'Doubling the budget for AI research would be a good start, given that other countries are so far behind the US and that we are looking for the next AI breakthrough,' says Lee.
Doubling the funding could double the probability that the next major AI breakthrough will be made in the United States, Lee said in an interview with CNBC this week.
Lee's book, "Artificial Intelligence: The Great Powers of China, Silicon Valley, and the New World Order", was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt Publishing House. Lee is the managing director of Sinovation Venture, which has invested in one of China's most prominent artificial intelligence companies, Face++.
In the 1980s, he developed an artificial intelligence system at Carnegie Mellon University that beat the highest-ranked Othello player in the United States.
Lee acknowledged the U.S. government's past technology competitions, such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects and the Agency's Robotics Challenge, and asked when the next one would be held to identify future visionaries.
Lee says that the U.S. scientists have worked very hard to get public funding.
"Academic influencers are not being taken to China, but to the big corporations", Lee said.
Facebook, Google and other tech companies have been recruiting top university students to work on artificial intelligence in recent years.
Lee also said that changes in immigration policy could help the US boost its efforts on artificial intelligence.
'I think that people who have a PhD in AI should be automatically granted green cards,' he said.
The State Council of China in July 2017 on its next generation AI development plan.
The National Science Foundation of China funds people working in academic institutions in the same way that the National Science Foundation and other government organizations give money to American researchers, but the quality of academic work is lower in China, Lee said.
The US Department of Defence established the Defense Department Joint Artificial Intelligence Center earlier this year, with the aim of bringing together partners from industry and academia, and the White House has announced the creation of a special committee on artificial intelligence.
Also this month, DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in an initiative called AI Next.
The NSF, for its part, invests over $100 million a year in AI research.
Meanwhile, the legislative initiative to establish a national AI security committee has been stalled for months.
Macedonians in a referendum on changing the country's name
Macedonians voted in a referendum on Sunday to change the country's name to "Republic of North Macedonia", a change that would resolve a decades-long dispute with Greece that has blocked the country's bid to join the European Union and NATO.
Greece, which owns the province of Macedonia, considers the name of its northern neighbour to be a de facto territorial claim on its territory and has therefore opposed its accession to the EU and NATO.
The governments of the two countries signed an agreement in June on a new name proposal, but nationalist opponents say the change would weaken the ethnic identity of Macedonia's Slav majority.
President Gjorge Ivanov has announced that he will not vote in the referendum, and the campaign against the vote is raising doubts about whether turnout will reach the required 50% threshold for the result to be legal.
The question on the ballot was: 'Are you in favour of NATO and EU membership and accepting the agreement with Greece?'
Proponents of the name change, such as Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the price is worth paying so that Macedonia, which emerged from the collapse of Yugoslavia, can aspire to become both a member of the EU and a member of NATO.
'I came today to vote for the future of our country, for the young people of Macedonia, so that they can live in freedom as members of the European Union, because it means a safer life for all of us,' said Olivera Georgijevska, 79, in Skopje.
Although the vote is not legally binding, a sufficient number of Members have said they respect the outcome of the vote to have a decisive impact.
The name change requires a two-thirds majority in Parliament.
According to the Central Election Commission, as of 1 p.m., no irregularities had been reported.
However, the voter turnout was only 16%, compared to 34% in the previous parliamentary elections in 2016, when 66% of eligible voters actually voted.
"I came to vote for my children and our place in Europe", said Gjose Tanevski, 62, who voted in the capital Skopje.
Prime Minister of Macedonia Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Dushko vote in a referendum on the name change of Macedonia in Strumica, Macedonia on 30 September 2018, paving the way for NATO and EU membership.
Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, prepared a small stage and placed chairs in front of the tents erected by the referendum boycotters outside the Skopje Parliament.
'We are pushing for NATO and the EU, but we want to join head-on, not through the kitchen door,' said Kavadarkov.
We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don't want to accept us as Macedonia, we can turn to other parties, like China and Russia, as part of the euro integration process.
The EU is also committed to the development of a common foreign and security policy, and to the promotion of the rule of law.
I believe that a large majority will vote for the name change, as over 80% of our citizens support the EU and NATO, Zaev said after casting his vote.
He said that the "I" sound was the "symbol of our future".
An opinion poll published by the Macedonian Institute of Political Research on Monday suggested a turnout of 30-43% in the referendum - below the required turnout.
In another poll by the Macedonian Telma TV, 57 percent of respondents planned to vote on Sunday.
70% of them said they would vote for the yes option.
In order for a referendum to succeed, the turnout must exceed 50% by one vote.
The failure of the referendum would be the first serious setback for the pro-Western government since it came to power last May.
Manchester City's Sergio Aguero has beaten Brighton's entire defence with a goal.
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling made a clear impression on Brighton's defence in their 2-0 win over Manchester City at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester.
Aguero made his goal in the 65th minute look ridiculously easy.
At the top of the frame, the Argentine forward has a pass from the center.
He found the empty space on the field by rushing through three Brighton defenders.
Then Aguero found himself surrounded by four green shirts.
He passed one defender and then left several others on the edge of Brighton's penalty area.
And then he found Sterling by delivering the ball to the left.
The English striker used his first touch inside the penalty area to return the ball to Aguero, who passed Brighton goalkeeper Mathew Ryan with a right-angled shot.
City manager Pep Guardiola told reporters that "Aguero has problems with his legs".
We talked about him playing 55 or 60 minutes.
And he did.
Luckily for us, he scored a goal in that time.
Sterling, however, had already given the celestials the upper hand in the league contest.
The goal came in the 29th minute of the game.
Aguero got the ball in a situation deep in the Brighton area.
He gave a beautiful pass to Leroy Sane on the left flank.
Sane made a few touches before he sent the ball backwards towards Sterling.
The Sky Blues forward just before the end of the line kicked the ball into the net.
City will face Hoffenheim in the Champions League group stage on Tuesday at 12:55 at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to be the cheerleader in the game against the Rockies .
The Nationals are out of the playoffs, so why push for the starting lineup?
But Scherzer, always competitive, is hoping to take the batting title in Sunday's game against the Colorado Rockies, but only if the Rockies have a chance to make the playoffs, one win away from the Los Angeles Dodgers in the Western Conference.
The Rockies took at least a wild card with a 5-2 win over the Nationals on Friday night, but they're still looking for their first division win.
"Even though we don't have the stakes, we can at least get on the batting board, "knowing that the stuttering atmosphere of the crowd and the other team here in Denver is creating for me the most demanding competition setting I've encountered this year.
Why wouldn't I want to take the challenge?
The Nationals have not yet released their starting pitcher for Sunday, but are reportedly willing to give Scherzer a chance under the circumstances.
Scherzer threw a practice session on Thursday, and he would play his first 34 games and pitch on Sunday with his normal resting order.
The right-hander for Washington has an 18-7 win-loss record this season, an ERA of 2.53, and he's burned the batter 300 times, with a slugging percentage of 220 2/3.
Trump campaigns in West Virginia
The president was referring indirectly to the situation of his Supreme Court associate justice, Brett Kavanaugh, while also talking about the importance of Republican voter turnout in the midterm elections.
All our achievements are at stake in November.
We're five weeks away from the most important election of our lives.
This is one of the really great -- I'm not just campaigning, I'm campaigning full-time, and that's why I go around fighting for the great candidates", she said.
Trump went on to say, "You're going to see this terrible, terrible, radical group of Democrats, you're going to see it happen right now.
They've decided to return to power by any means necessary, and you can see their malice and malice.
They don't choose who they hurt or who they have to beat to get power, which is what they want, power and authority, but we won't give it to them.
He said the Democrats had taken the task of "resisting and preventing".
"And it has been seen in the last four days", he said, calling the Democrats "mad and mean and malicious and lying".
When he referred to the longest-serving Democratic senator on the Senate Judiciary Committee, Dianne Feinstein, the audience responded with loud boos.
Do you remember his answer?
Did you leak the document?
Uh, uh, what.
Well, uh, no, I'll wait a little bit - that was really bad body language - worst body language I've ever seen.
Labour is no longer a tolerant party.
It doesn't tolerate those who speak their minds.
I was not really surprised when the Momentum activists in my local party supported a no-confidence motion against me.
I'm just the last of a long line of Labour MPs who are told I'm not welcome just because we say what we think.
My colleague in the parliament, Joan Ryan, was treated in the same way just because she stood firmly against anti-Semitism.
In my case, the motion of censure was criticism for disagreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
On issues related to responsible economic policy, national security, Europe, ironically, similar issues on which Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
The Nottingham East Labour Conference said on Friday that 'we want our meetings to be inclusive and productive'.
For most of the eight years that I have been a Labour local councillor, Friday council meetings have been just that.
Now many in the Assembly do not follow that tone, and a more 'friendly and gentle' policy has long since been forgotten, if it ever began.
It is becoming clearer that the Labour Party is no longer tolerating dissent and that every opinion is judged on the basis of whether it suits the party leadership or not.
This started soon after Jeremy became director, and colleagues who thought I shared a similar political vision started expecting me to do things that I would never have done, whether it was national security or the EU's internal market.
Every time I speak in public - and it doesn't really matter what I say - the result is a barrage of insults on social media demanding that I withdraw my vote, reject centrist politics and be told that I should not be in the Labour Party.
And it's not just my experience.
I know that I am indeed more fortunate than some of my colleagues, because the comments made against me are political in nature.
I have great respect for the professionalism and determination of my colleagues who face sexist and racist insults on a daily basis and never waver.
The normalisation of malpractice is one of the most disturbing features of the politics of this era.
Last week Jeremy Corbyn demanded that the Labour Party should adopt a culture of tolerance.
In reality, we are no longer a party that accepts different opinions, and with each vote of no confidence or change in the electoral rules, the party is only becoming more limited.
For two years, I've been told to keep a low profile and to refrain from expressing my thoughts so that everything would go well.
But that's not why I went into politics.
Since joining the Labour Party as a student 32 years ago as a result of the Thatcher government's neglect of a comprehensive school, I have worked to promote better public services for those who need them most, both as a councillor and as a minister.
I've never hidden my political line, not even in the last election.
No one in the Nottingham East constituency could have been surprised by my views or my disagreements with the current leadership.
To those who supported the initiative last Friday, I want to say that as the state moves towards a Brexit that will hurt households, businesses and public services, I see no need to waste time and energy questioning my confidence in the leadership of the Labour Party.
But my real message is not to Nottingham Momentum, but to my constituents: I represent you with honor, and the threat of dismissal or the promotion of a political career will not prevent me from acting in a way that I believe is in your best interests.
Chris Leslie is the Member of Parliament for Nottingham East.
Ayr v Melrose 38-17: Ayr undefeated in the block
Two last-minute goals may have skewed the outcome of the match, but Ayr undoubtedly deserved victory in the day's entertaining Tennent's Premiership match.
Ayr is now at the top of the table as the only team in the top 10 to have never lost a match.
A great defense and a more successful risk-taking was what ultimately sustained them, and coach Peter Murchie can rightly be pleased.
'We have been challenged in our matches and we are still unbeaten, so I can be happy,' he says.
Robyn Christie of Melrose says, "All credit to Ayr, they took risks better than we did".
Ayr took the lead in the 14th minute with a goal from Grant Anderson and a successful conversion from Frazier Climo, but a yellow card from Scotland captain Roy Hughes, who was dropped by the Warriors for the match, allowed Melrose to go up, and Jason Baggot scored.
Climo extended Ayr's lead on a penalty, and just before halftime he scored and managed a conversion kick to extend Ayr's lead to 17-5.
But Melrose started the second half well with a Patrick Anderson goal, which Baggot managed to convert into a conversion kick, narrowing the gap to five points.
The match was delayed for a long time when Ruaridh Knott was seriously injured and carried off the field. As the game continued, Ayr increased his lead with a goal from Stafford McDowall, whose conversion kick was successful.
Ayr captain Blair Macpherson was shown a yellow card, followed by a hard-pressed goal from Bruce Colvine of Melrose, whose conversion failed.
However, the home team responded when Struan Hutchinson was given a yellow card for tackling the ballless Climo, and Macpherson made a goal from a free-throw from Ayr's goal.
Climo made the conversion kick the same way he did before, and Kyle Rowe grabbed David Armstrong's kick and sliced Gregor Henry to finish the home side's fifth goal.
The star of Still Game is starting in the restaurant business.
Still Game star Ford Kieran has been named CEO of a licensed restaurant company, and will be embarking on a career in the restaurant industry.
The 56-year-old actor will play Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC show, which he is writing with comedy partner Greg Hemphill.
The Twins have announced that the upcoming ninth season will be the series' last, and it seems that Kiernan is already planning his life after Craiglang.
According to public records, he's listed as a director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor himself declined to comment on the information, but a source at the Scottish Sun suggested that Kiernan wanted to be involved in Glasgow's thriving restaurant business.
The sea is ours: landlocked Bolivia tries to regain access to the Pacific Ocean by right
The sailors were patrolling outside the naval base in La Paz.
On the flagpoles of public buildings, a flag of the sea lions flies.
The naval bases from Titicaca to the Amazon are embellished with the slogan: "The sea belongs to us by right.
It's our duty to get it back.
Inland, Bolivia's memory of the coastline lost to Chile in the bloody 19th century resource wars remains strong  as does the desire to sail the Pacific once more.
The hope is at its highest point in decades as Bolivia awaits the International Court of Justice's decision on October 1 after five years of deliberation.
Bolivia has a strong belief in progress, a spirit of togetherness and cohesion, and of course a positive attitude in the run-up to the final solution, said Bolivian diplomat Roberto Calzadilla.
Many Bolivians across the country are watching the International Court of Justice decision on the big screens with hope that the Hague will support  after decades of disrupted debate  Bolivia's position that Chile has an obligation to grant Bolivia independent access to the sea.
Bolivia's charismatic president, Evo Morales, who faces a contentious battle for re-election next year, has a lot riding on his next Monday lineup.
'The return to the Pacific is very close', he assured me towards the end of August.
However, some analysts believe that the court is unlikely to rule in Bolivia's favor, and even if it did, the situation would not change much.
The Dutch-based UN body has no jurisdiction to hand over Chile's administration, and the ICJ has stated that it does not determine the outcome of any negotiations.
The fact that the ICJ decision is issued only six months after the last opinions were issued suggests that the case is 'not complex'", says Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert in international law.
Furthermore, the last four years have slowed rather than advanced Bolivia's intentions.
'The current Bolivian government has hijacked the issue of maritime connectivity,' said Zárate.
Morales's controversial rhetoric has stifled the goodwill of the rest of Chile, he said.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to discuss this at some stage, but it will be very difficult to organise negotiations afterwards.
Neither country has had another embassy since 1962.
The former president and Bolivian representative in The Hague, Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, does not accept the view that the court's decision was exceptionally swift.
Monday will give Bolivia an "exceptional opportunity to start a new era in relations with Chile" and an opportunity to "end 139 years of differences for the benefit of both sides", he said.
Calzadilla also denies that Morales, one of Latin America's most popular presidents, used the maritime issue as a political prop.
'Bolivia will never give up its right to be connected to the Pacific Ocean,' he added.
The decision is an opportunity to understand that it is time for us to move on from the past.
North Korea has announced that it will not engage in a nuclear attack unless it can trust the United States.
North Korea will not give up its nuclear weapons first unless they can rely on Washington, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho said.
Ri will speak at the UN General Assembly on Saturday.
He reminded the US to keep the promises made by the heads of state at the Singapore summit.
Rin's stance came just as US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is about to resume deadlocked nuclear diplomacy, just three months after the US met Kim Jong Un in Singapore.
The EU's position on the issue of the right to freedom of movement for workers is also very clear.
Until Pyongyang has taken significant steps to promote disarmament, Washington is cautious about adopting the declaration.
Both Kim and U.S. President Donald Trump want a new summit.
But the view that Pyongyang is about to give up an arsenal that the state likely sees as the only real way to guarantee its security has been widely questioned.
Pompeo is scheduled to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for the next Kim-Trump summit.
The Paris fashion shows will feature the latest in the large-scale headwear collection, which will soon be on display in your neighborhood.
If you want to enlarge your hat collection or cover the sun entirely, you don't have to keep looking.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne unveiled their SS19 lineup in a showcase of a selection of exotic, oversized headwear that would be a stunner at Paris Fashion Week.
The most impractical headwear is taking over Instagram this summer, and these designers have also sent their amazing creations to fashion shows.
Valentino's most striking creation was a beige hat with a wide feathered neckline that covered the heads of the models almost completely.
Other extravagant furnishings included a jewelled watermelon, a magic hat, and even a pineapple - but they are not designed to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also revealed a selection of bizarre masks  just in time for Halloween.
Several of the colorful masks had lips sewn on, and they were more like Hannibal Lecter than high fashion.
One creature, equipped with a snorkel and a mask, looked more like a diving machine, and the other resembled a melted-ice cream cone.
And if you want to make a stand for big fashion, you're in luck.
Fashion followers predict that giant scarves are about to appear in the streets.
The oversized hats closely follow the "La Bombaa", the half-meter-long, barrel-laden straw hat seen on everyone from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult of the impractical hat, which has been featured widely on social media, has also been joined by the fashion models of another giant creature, a beach shack made of  straw, which is almost as big as the model wearing it.
The orange-burnt, lime-rimmed, white-leather bracelets were the most eye-catching creation of the SS19 by Jacquemus La Riviera at Paris Fashion Week.
Famous stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: "I think I'll see large-sized hats and beach bags on the street next summer". "The designers have made such a big impression that it would be difficult to ignore the demand for large-sized accessories".
John Edward: Language skills are essential for a citizen of the world
The Scottish primary schools have traditionally been successful in their learning outcomes, and this success has continued in 2018 following strong test scores, reinforced by individual and community success in sport, the arts, music and other community projects.
These schools, with over 30 000 pupils spread across Scotland, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to provide a high standard of service to their pupils and parents.
Private schools aim to prepare their pupils for their chosen career, for further and higher education, and for world citizenship.
As an educational actor capable of designing and implementing tailored learning content, we have noticed the position of languages as the preferred and desired subject in continuing education institutions.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you talk to a person in a language he understands, it goes to his head.
If you speak to a person in his own language, the message goes to his heart.
This is a powerful reminder that we cannot rely solely on the English language if we want to build trusting relationships with people in other countries.
The latest results for this year show that languages are at the top of the list in terms of the percentage of students who pass through the private schools.
68% of pupils studying foreign languages achieved the highest A grade.
The data were collected from 74 SCIS schools, and it was found that of the students who received the highest grade, 72% studied Mandarin, 72% studied German, 69% studied French, and 63% studied Spanish.
This shows that the private schools in Scotland support the study of foreign languages as an essential skill that children and young people will no doubt need in the future.
Languages are currently optional subjects, but they are given the same value as natural science subjects (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) in the curriculum of private schools and elsewhere.
The UK Employment Office survey conducted in 2014 found that 17% of the situations where an employer had difficulty finding a suitable employee for the job were explained by a lack of language skills.
The development of language skills is therefore all the more necessary in order to promote the future career development of young people.
The more the potential jobs require language skills, the more essential these skills become in a global world.
Having studied another language, one has a future advantage in this lifelong skill, regardless of the career one has chosen.
The ability to communicate directly with a foreigner automatically puts the person with a language skills ahead of the competition.
A survey by YouGov in 2013 of more than 4,000 British adults found that 75 per cent could not hold a conversation in a foreign language, with French being the only language that was spoken by a double-digit number of 15 per cent.
This is why investing in language learning is important for today's children.
Knowing the languages of developing countries, in particular, gives children a better chance of finding a meaningful career.
Within Scotland, schools differ in the languages they teach.
Many schools focus on traditional languages, while some teach specifically languages that are expected to be important to Britons in 2020, such as Mandarin and Japanese.
Whatever your child's interests, there are always several language options in private schools, taught by specialised teachers.
Private schools in Scotland are dedicated to providing a learning environment that prepares children and equips them with the skills needed to succeed, whatever the future may bring.
In this era, it is undeniable that in the international business environment, languages will continue to be very important for the future of the country, and this must be reflected in education.
Indeed, modern languages should be seen as 'international communication skills'.
Private schools will continue to provide this freedom of choice, diversity and high standards for young people in Scotland.
I must be fair.
John Edward is the director of the Scottish Schools Council, SCIS.
LeBron is making his debut on Sunday in San Diego .
For the fans who have been waiting for the first appearance of LeBron James in the Los Angeles Lakers, the wait is almost over.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego on Sunday in a pre-season game.
But how many minutes he actually plays remains to be seen.
"It's going to be more than one, and less than 48", said Walton Lakers on their official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James is likely to play the afternoon minutes.
James, who was at the practice earlier this week, was asked about his plans for the Lakers' six preseason games.
"At this point in my career, I don't need any more pre-matches to prepare", he said.
Trump West Virginia campaign, the YouTube channel
President Donald Trump is starting a series of campaign rallies today in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It's the first of five events Trump has planned for next week, including sympathetic destinations like Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the vote on his nomination to fill the vacancy of a Supreme Court justice, Trump is looking to build support for the upcoming midterm elections, as Republicans risk losing their majority in Congress in the November election.
What time is the Trump West Virginia campaign today and how do you see it online?
Trump's event in Wheeling, West Virginia, will begin at 7pm eastern time on Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump's West Virginia campaign event online as a live stream on YouTube by clicking below.
Trump will take the stand this week at the hearing of Supreme Court Justice-elect Brett Kavanaugh, which has become heated over allegations of sexual harassment that have delayed Senate confirmation for as much as a week as the FBI is investigating the allegations.
But the primary goal of this series of campaigns is to support the success of the Republican candidates in the tight November election.
According to the president's campaign, the purpose of the events over the next five weeks is to "awaken volunteer and supportive Republicans to protect and expand the majority in the Senate and House", according to Reuters.
"Controlling Congress is so important to his agenda that the president is prepared to travel to as many states as possible during a busy campaign season", a Trump campaign official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told Reuters.
Today's venue is the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, and the venue will be packed with fans from as far away as Ohio and Pennsylvania, as well as media from Pittsburgh, according to West Virginia Metro News.
Saturday is Trump's second visit this month to West Virginia, the state where he won by more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is backing West Virginia Republican Senate candidate Patrick Morris, who has been lagging in the polls.
"It's not a good sign for Morrissey that the president is trying to boost his approval ratings in the polls", said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA shows fight to keep hope alive ahead of Sunday's singles
After three one-on-one sessions, the four-way Saturday afternoon was just what this Ryder Cup needed.
While the self-reinforcing power of success is a completely invented phenomenon in sports, the players believe in it, and even more so in tournaments like this.
Where is this prosperity with them now?
"They had a six-point lead that was reduced to four, so we're going to take this power of success as a slap in the face", said Jordan Spieth as he walked off for the day.
Europe, of course, has the advantage of four points ahead and 12 to play for.
The Americans, as Spieth said, feel they have a little wind in their sails and a lot of encouragement, like Spieth and Justin Thomas's fitness, which allowed them to play all day together and score three out of four.
Spieth has been outnumbered by the green and led by example.
The roaring clang of victory celebrations intensified as his lap progressed, as he managed a critical putt to level the match at four, with him and Thomas two points behind after two holes.
The putt they used to win Game 15 was followed by a similar shout, which gave the impression that he believes the U.S. team has not yet lost.
"You have to focus really hard and just worry about your own match", Spieth said.
It's the only thing these players have left now.
18 holes to make an impact.
The only players to have scored more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are the undisputed Ryder Cup legends Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood.
The quirky but sweet duo of Europe has won four out of four flawlessly.
Moliwood was the only pair to not make a single bogie on a Saturday afternoon, but they avoided the bogie on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and the final nine holes on Friday morning.
That lap, and the way they're giving and receiving energy from this frenzied crowd, confirms that they're the Sunday favourites, and when the sun goes down at Le Golf National, there could be no two more favourites to ensure a possible European victory than Fleetwood and Molinari.
Preferably both at the same time in different holes.
But it is too early to talk about the success of Europe.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly defeated Alex Noren and Sergio Garcia, the hero of the morning foursome.
One bogie and two tubbogie on the first nine holes dug the Spaniard and the Swede so deep into the hole that they were nowhere near surviving.
Although, on Sunday, no one's gonna help you out of the hole.
Quarterball and foursome are fascinating to watch closely from the perspective of the partnership: what advice they give or fail to give, and how strategy can change in an instant.
Europe has played better as a team so far, taking a significant lead before the final day, but this quarter proved that the US team has a fighting spirit, though it is suspected, especially in the US.
Europe takes a 10-6 lead before the final day of the Ryder Cup
Europe are in a strong lead heading into the final day of the Ryder Cup after taking a 10-6 lead from the United States in Saturday's four-ball and four-ball matches.
The brilliant duo of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the way with two victories over the stunning Tiger Woods, and took the lead to a high of four points today at Le Golf National.
Thomas Bjorn's European side, struggling to retain a win they lost two years ago in Hazeltine, managed a feeble-minded U.S. team in the morning fours to take the match 3-1.
The United States were the toughest opponents in the quarterfinals, winning two games, but they were unable to shake off the lead.
Jim Furyk's side needed eight points in Sunday's 12 doubles to keep the victory.
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to win four points in a row, and he and Molinari, also known collectively as Molliwood, were the only pair in Ryder Cup history to win four points in the first four games after a sensational weekend.
After first crushing the four-balls of Woods and Patrick Reed, they then overwhelmed the disheartened Woods and the American rookie Bryson Dechambeau, who was even more stunned, 5-4.
Woods, who barely made it through two games on Saturday, was brilliant at times, but has lost 19 of his 29 games in fours and fours, and even seven in a row.
Justin Rose rested for the morning four-ball, but returned with Henrik Stenson for the quarter-finals, but lost 2-1 to Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepkal, who are ranked first and third.
Europe did not get everything it wanted on this cool and pleasant day from Paris to lunch.
Three-time champion Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set a high-water mark for the Americans with two points on Saturday.
They got a bold 2-1 win over Spain's Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the fours, and later a 4-3 win over Poulter and Rory McIlroy in the fours, though losing the first two holes.
Only twice in Ryder Cup history has a team moved up from four points behind to tie at the start of a double, even though for Fury, a tie is enough to keep the victory.
Although, after two days in second best, it may be that the Sunday counterattack is too much to ask.
North Korea will not under any circumstances disarm itself without confidence.
North Korea's foreign minister told the UN on Saturday that continued sanctions were only increasing mistrust of the United States, and under these circumstances, there is no chance that North Korea would unilaterally give up its nuclear weapons.
Ri Yong Ho told the UN General Assembly that North Korea has taken "significant acts of goodwill" over the past year, including stopping nuclear and missile tests, dismantling a nuclear test site and promising not to increase its nuclear weapons or technology.
'However, we have not seen a similar gesture from the United States,' he said.
Without trust in the United States, we cannot be sure of the preservation of national security, so in these circumstances, unilaterally disarming ourselves is not possible.
While Ri repeated the familiar lament that Washington does not accept a phased nuclear disarmament that would reward North Korea for every intermediate step, his statement is nonetheless significant in that it does not completely rule out unilateral disarmament, as Pyongyang has done in the past.
Ri referred to the joint statement made by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first summit between the sitting US president and the North Korean leader in Singapore on 12 June, in which Kim pledged "the denuclearisation of the Korean Peninsula" and Trump promised to guarantee the security of North Korea.
North Korea has sought to officially end the 1950-1953 Korean War, but the United States has insisted that Pyongyang must first give up its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also opposed the easing of the tough international sanctions imposed on North Korea.
The US demands nuclear disarmament first and has increased pressure through sanctions to achieve its goals by force, even in opposition to the peace declaration, said Ri.
The idea that sanctions will bring us to our knees is the wish of the indifferent.
But the problem is that continuing to impose sanctions only deepen our mistrust.
Ri did not mention plans to hold the next Kim-Trump summit, which Trump himself emphasized to the UN earlier this week.
Instead, the minister highlighted three meetings with South Korean leader Moon Jae-in in the last five months, adding: If the disarmament demanding party had been South Korea and not the US, the situation would not have reached this impasse.
Yet Rin's tone was markedly different from last year when he told the UN General Assembly that the missile attack on the continental United States was inevitable after "evil President" Trump called Kim "missile man" with a suicidal intent.
Last year, Trump threatened to "totally destroy" North Korea, but this year, Trump lavishly praised Kim for his courage in approaching disarmament, but he still stressed that there is still work to be done and sanctions must be maintained until North Korea gives up its nuclear weapons.
On Wednesday, Trump said he has no time limit: "If it takes two years, three years or five months, it doesn't matter".
China and Russia have suggested that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the progress it has already made.
However, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday that "the Security Council's enforcement of sanctions must continue vigorously and unfailingly until we witness a complete, final and verified denuclearization".
The Security Council has unanimously stepped up sanctions against North Korea since 2006 with the aim of strengthening the financial channels for the production of ballistic and nuclear targets in Pyongyang.
The meeting was part of the UN General Assembly and Mr Pompeo also announced that he would be visiting Pyongyang again next month to prepare for the second summit.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but the latest visit didn't go smoothly.
As he left Pyongyang, he described progress, but North Korea condemned Pompeo's "gangster-like" demands only hours later.
North Korea committed to shutting down the missile base and nuclear facility at a meeting with Secretary-General Moon earlier this month in the event that the United States takes "comparable measures".
According to Pompeo, Kim means "with appropriate measures" to ensure the security that Trump committed to at the Singapore meeting and move towards normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard students complete a course on how to get enough rest
All undergraduate students at Harvard University are participating in a class this year designed to increase student rest, a counterpunch to the university's thriving macho culture of late-night weight-training on caffeine.
According to the researcher, students at the best university in the world are often quite ignorant of the basics of their own well-being.
Charles Czeisler, a professor of medicine at Harvard University who works in sleep research at Brigham and Women's Hospital, who designed the course, believes that it is the first of its kind in the United States.
Czeisler got the idea for the course after giving a lecture on the effects of sleep deprivation on learning.
After the lecture, a young woman approached me and said: Why am I hearing about this only now, in my final year of study?
No one had ever told him about the need for sleep, which I think was surprising, he told the Telegraph in an interview.
The first-ever course this year will teach students how proper exercise habits support academic and athletic performance and improve overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, a professor at Harvard Medical School and vice president of the university's health services, says that the university decided to hold the course after hearing of students suffering from severe sleep deprivation during the school week.
The one-hour course includes a series of interactive tasks.
One section shows students a picture of a dorm room where they can click on coffee cups, curtains, sports equipment and books to learn about the effects of caffeine and light, the impact of sleep deprivation on sports performance and the importance of regular nighttime activities.
The second section tells participants how prolonged sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression, and cancer.
A map of the campus, complete with interactive icons, encourages participants to reflect on their daily routines.
We know that this has no direct impact on student behaviour.
However, we believe that they have a right to know about these issues, just as they have a right to know about the health effects of smoking", Professor Czeisler adds.
The all-night study marathons, according to Professor Czeisler, are still a source of pride, and modern technology and the ever-increasing pressures of students have made sleep deprivation a growing problem.
'Adequate and quality sleep should be the students' secret weapon against stress, fatigue and anxiety, and even against weight gain, because sleep deprivation causes a state in the brain that resembles starvation, which is why people are constantly hungry,' the professor points out.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old chemical and physical psychology student from California, helped Professor Czeisler design the course after attending one of his classes during his first year at Harvard last year.
He says the course opened his eyes and gave him the impetus to organize a course that would cover all students on campus.
He hopes that all postgraduate students will be able to complete a similar course of study before moving to a competitive institution.
Professor Czeisler recommends that students set their alarm clocks to remind them of bedtime in addition to waking them up in the morning, and urges them to keep in mind the adverse effects of electronic monitors and LED lighting on circadian rhythms, which can make it difficult to fall asleep.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers , the shot from the left of the goal took the win from Gerrard 's players .
Steven Gerrard and the Rangers had another losing day as Dolly Menge's shot through the defence broke Livingston's record to 1-0.
The Ibrox players were looking for their first win since 4-1 against St Johnstone in February, but Gary Holt's team took the win this time, and Gerrard suffered only his second defeat in 18 games as manager, eight points behind the current leader of the Premier League, Hearts.
Menga kicked the ball into the goal seven minutes before half-time, and the Rangers' battlefield was no longer level after that.
Rangers have dropped to sixth place, while Livingston has climbed to third, with only Hibernian ahead of him in the points.
The Rangers may have other problems ahead, as Calum Spence was injured during the game when a stranger's object hit him in the head, and the wound has been treated.
Gerrard made eight substitute appearances in the team that had beaten Ayr to reach the semi-finals of the Scottish League Cup.
Holt continued to use the same lineup as the Livi 11 that took the point away from Hearts last week, and the same strategy paid off again, with a well-constructed lineup that managed to punish the opposition at almost every turn.
While the Rangers were able to dominate the ball possession, Livingston was better able to exploit the situation to his advantage.
Livingston had a chance to score with two minutes remaining on the clock when Mengan's first pitch gave Scott Pittman a free pass to Allan McGregor, but Pittman failed to take advantage of the opportunity.
Keaghan Jacobs then directed his free kick to Craig Halkett, but the other defender Alan Lithgow only managed to shoot wide into the back of the net.
Rangers took control of the game in the second half, but in the last third of the game, the air was no longer confident.
Alfredo Morelos demanded the penalty after fifteen minutes he and Steven Lawless had collided, but the judge Steven Thomson ignored the Colombian's requests.
Rangers managed to score only two goals in the first half, but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly easily defended Lassana Coulibaly's puck and Ovie Ejeria's weak shot.
Livingstone's goal in the 34th minute was an unexpected opening, but it was not due solely to the hard work of the team.
The Rangers still couldn't do anything about Jacobs' long passing game.
Scott Arfield was unresponsive as Declan Gallagher passed to Scott Robinson, who cold-heartedly sent the ball to Menga for an easy goal.
Gerrard decided to trade Coulibaly for Ryan Kent, and the change made an immediate impact, as Kent made a suitable hole for Morelos, but the attack interrupted Kelly's impressive quick defence.
Livingston put the visitors back in their own game as Lithgow and Halkett continued their long passes one after the other.
The Holt team had a chance to extend their lead in the closing seconds of the game, but McGregor's fine defense prevented Jacobs from reaching the corner before Lithgow could get to his position.
Glenn Middleton, who was coming off the Rangers trade, also called for a penalty after a fight with Jacobs, but again, Thomson looked away.
German inventor of the Geiger counter
Next page in our Sunday Morning edition: September 30, 1882, Johannes Wilhelm Hans Geiger, the future physicist, was born in Germany on this day 136 years ago.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, which led to the development of the device later known as the Geiger counter.
The method became one of the pillars of science, and the meter became a central concept in pop culture. For example, the 1950 film "The Clocks of Coronado", in which Roy Rogers and Dale Evans portrayed scientists who looked like cowboys, is a good example:
Man: What the hell is that?
It's a geiger counter, and it's used to detect radioactive minerals, like uranium.
When you put the headphones on, you can actually hear the effect of radioactive radiation on the minerals.
Evans: "Look at that, it's really raining!"
Hans Geiger died in 1945 a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name lives on.
New cancer drug can teach the immune system to 'see' malignant cells
A new cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to 'see' and 'kill' malignant cells
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize malignant cells as part of the treatment
The method involves isolating resistance cells from the patient and changing them in the laboratory
After treatment, the cells injected back into the body are able to "see" proteins typical of many cancers
The pilot vaccine has shown promising results in patients with various cancers.
For example, a patient with ovarian cancer had lost her cancer cells within 18 months of receiving a vaccine that teaches the immune system to recognize malignant cells.
The method involves isolating resistant cells from the patient and modifying them in the laboratory so that they can absorb the HER2 proteins typical of many cancers.
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, U.S.A., describes the method: "Our results show that this is a very promising vaccine".
HER2 "drives the growth of several types of cancer", explains Professor Berzofsky. "These include breast cancer, as well as cancers of the ovaries, lungs, and colon".
A similar approach - taking immune cells from a patient and teaching them to attack cancer cells - has also been successful in treating a type of leukemia.
Kanye West has been the subject of a barrage of criticism after he praised Trump on Saturday Night Live wearing a campaign hat.
The show didn't go as planned.
Kanye West got a slap on the wrist on Saturday Night Live for his outrageous praise of President Donald Trump and announcing that he's running for president in the 2020 election.
After performing his third song of the night, "Ghost Town", in Trump's Make America Great Again campaign hat, West attacked the Democrats and reiterated his support for President Trump.
I often have conversations with white people and they ask me how I can support Trump because he's a racist.
If racism was a problem, I would have left America a long time ago, he says.
The evening began with a sketch in which Matt Damon mocked Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, which relates to Christine Blasey Ford's allegations of sexual harassment by Kavanaugh.
West's fast was not live-streamed, but comedian Chris Rock uploaded a snippet of it to social media.
It's unclear if Rock intended to mock West in his post.
West also complained to the audience that he was mistreated on stage because of the hat he wore.
I was bullied behind the scenes.
I was told I couldn't go onstage with this hat on.
I'm being teased!
"I'm not a good person", West says in an interview with the Washington Examiner.
West continues, "Do you want to see what being on the sidelines is like?" and says he's going to wear a Superman suit because "you can't tell me what to do".
Try with love.
According to Variety, West's comments were met with boos from the audience on at least two occasions, and the show's performers appeared embarrassed, with one of the attendees describing the situation to the magazine as follows: "The entire studio went completely silent".
West was chosen to appear on the show on a short notice to replace Ariana Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days earlier.
West caused a lot of confusion for many viewers by performing a song "I love it" dressed as a Perrier bottle.
West is backed by the leader of the conservative TPUSA organization, Candace Turner, who praised his courage on Twitter: "THANK YOU FOR YOUR COURGE".
But talk show host Karen Hunter tweeted that West is just being himself, which is just wonderful.
However, I can choose to BE A PERSON (by buying his music or clothing brand or by supporting his art) who I consider to be supporting and spreading an ideology harmful to my community.
He's a free man.
The same goes for us, he added.
The rapper announced on Twitter before his performance that he had changed his name to "the person formerly known as Kanye West".
West is not the first artist to change his name, but here comes Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
The other rapper, Snoop Dogg, was also known as Snoop Lion, and of course, we remember the late music legend, Prince, who changed his name to the symbol and then the artist formerly known as Prince.
The Belfast restaurant lumberjack is charged with attempted murder .
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after he was stabbed to death in a restaurant in east Belfast on Friday.
The incident happened in the area of Ballyhackamore, according to the police.
The accused is expected to appear in the Belfast Magistrates' Court on Monday.
The charge will be reviewed by the public prosecutor's office.
Game of Thrones actress Kit Harington is taking on the toxic masculinity of the world .
Kit Harington is best known for his sword-wielding hero role as Jon Snow in the HBO violent fantasy series Game of Thrones.
But Harrington has attacked the stereotype of the macho hero: According to the 31-year-old actor, such roles give young boys the feeling that respect must be earned with toughness.
In an interview with the Sunday Times cultural section, Harrington suspects that "something has gone wrong" and questions the ways in which the toxic masculine is being addressed in the #MeToo era.
Harrington, who recently married 31-year-old Rose Leslie, another Game of Thrones star, admits that he has a strong desire to get involved.
'The question of where we have gone wrong with masculinity is one that is very much on my mind at the moment,' she says.
 What have men been taught in their formative years that has led to the problems that are now evident?
Harrington believes that television and its highly masculine characters are partly responsible for the increase in toxic masculinity.
He continues: "What is innate and what is learned?
What is it that is taught on TV and in the streets that makes young boys feel they have to be a certain way to be a man?
I think this is one of the great questions of our time -- how can we change this?
Young men have something very wrong with them.
In the interview, he also admits that he would not be involved in the production of the prequel or sequel to Game of Thrones after the series ends next summer, because he has, in his own words, "had enough of the battlefields and horses".
In November, Harrington will appear in a new version of Sam Shepard's play True West, which tells the story of a film producer and his brother-in-law.
The actor recently revealed that getting to know his future wife, Rose, was the best thing that Game of Thrones has ever offered him.
"I met my wife on this show, so in a way it gave me my future family and my life from then on", he says.
Leslie Rose played Ygritte, the love interest of Jon Snow played by Harrington in the Emmy-winning fantasy series.
The couple were married in June 2018 at Leslie's family's estate in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: New infections in China have increased by 14%
China has reported a 14 percent increase in the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in its population.
Health officials say the virus has affected more than 820,000 people in the country.
Some 40 000 new cases have been reported in the second quarter of 2018 alone.
The clear majority of new cases are sexually transmitted, which is a change from previous statistics.
Traditionally, HIV has spread rapidly in some parts of China through contaminated blood transfusions.
However, according to Chinese health officials who spoke at a conference in Yunnan Province, this has reduced HIV infections to almost zero.
A year later, however, the number of new HIV infections and AIDS cases in China has risen by 100,000.
Sexual transmission of HIV is a serious issue in China's LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people has been reported to be widespread.
Studies have estimated that due to the conservative values of the country, 70-90% of men who have sex with men will eventually marry women.
Many of the contagious feelings are due to inadequate protection in such relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised to ensure the availability of HIV drugs to the general public as part of efforts to solve the problem.
Maxine Waters denies the leaked Republican senator's information and accuses her of spreading "dangerous lies and conspiracy theories"
U.S. Rep. Maxine Waters on Saturday denied allegations that her staff posted personal information on three Republican senators' Wikipedia pages.
The Democrat from Los Angeles asserted that the allegations were spread by "far-right" commentators and websites.
"Lies, lies and more despicable lies", Waters said in a statement posted on Twitter.
Among the information released are the home addresses and phone numbers of former South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham and Utah State Senators Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch.
An unknown source released the information Thursday from the U.S. House of Representatives during a Senate committee hearing on allegations of sexual misconduct against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak occurred shortly after three senators had questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative websites like Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the Hillin newspaper said the messages were posted from an IP address associated with Waters' office and by a Waters staff member.
'This baseless accusation is completely false and an absolute lie,' Water continued.
My staff, whose identity, personal data and security have been compromised by these fraudulent and false accusations, are not in any way responsible for the leak of this information.
This baseless accusation is completely false and absolutely false.
Waters' statement was quickly met with criticism online, including from former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
'The way he denies this is very hostile,' Fleischer wrote.
It seems that his character is not suitable for a member of Congress.
When a person is accused of something he has not done, there is no reason for him to act in a hostile manner.
There's no need to be cocky.
There's no reason to question the prosecutor's motives.
You have to be calm and composed.
Fleischer appeared to be comparing Waters' reaction to Democrats' criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused of excessive hostility during Thursday's hearing.
Republican candidate Omar Navarro, who is running for Waters' seat in the midterm congressional elections, has also expressed his views on Twitter.
"Unbelievable if this is true", he tweeted.
Waters stated in his statement that he had contacted the appropriate authorities and law enforcement agencies in response to these fraudulent allegations.
'We will ensure that the perpetrators are exposed,' he continued, 'and that they are held legally accountable for any destructive and dangerous actions against any or all of my staff members.'
Johnny English strikes again. The underpowered agent parody of Rowan Atkinson.
It's a long-standing tradition to find Brexit references in any film that has a little bit of a British feel to it, but this doesn't seem to fit the Johnny English parody and action comedy series that started in 2003 with the Johnny English queen and was revived in 2011 with the sequel Johnny English: Newborn.
Can the satire of a nation with a tongue in cheek become Britain's new national export success?
Either way, the dirty-eyed, cheeky, incompetent Johnny English has earned his license to be a jerk once again, and his name alone tells you that this is a comedy creation aimed at the non-English-speaking film market.
Of course, it's the dumb secret agent who desperately tries to breathe the glamour that's melting around him, but turns out to be a mixture of Inspector Clouseau, Mr. Bean and that hapless one-note musician at the London 2012 opening concert.
The character is based on the cosmopolitan and mystical man of the world, originally portrayed by Atkinson in the now-forgotten Barclaycard TV commercials.
There's a moment in the last act.
I especially liked the scene where Johnny English arrives in a helicopter wearing medieval armor and the rotator cuffs bang his helmet.
Atkinson's physical comedy is evident, but the humour itself seems subtle and oddly unnecessary, especially since 'serious' film brands such as 007 and Mission Impossible now offer humour as part of the core of the film.
The humor seems to be directed at children, and the deranged treatment of Johnny English does not strike me as as inventive and as sharp-sighted as Atkinson's comic of Mr. Bean's silent roles.
The starting point, which is repeated every year, is that Britain is in trouble, and worse.
A cyber hacker has infiltrated Britain's top-secret spy network and revealed the identities of all British agents on the ground, to the dismay of the agent in charge, which is presented as an unfortunate small role performance by Kevin Eldon.
This is the final straw for the brash and impending prime minister, who is already up to his ears in political unpopularity: Emma Thompson does everything in the skin of a Theresa May parody character, but the script just doesn't give her enough room.
When the intelligence advisors tell him that all the spies in the field have been compromised, he has to be called to the rescue by someone who has already retired from active duty.
Of course, this is the quirky Johnny English himself, who spends his retirement days teaching at a gentlemen's school, but also giving informal lessons in the fine art of espionage, and the subject is riveted with some clever jokes, and English takes a School of Rock-style lesson in the ins and outs of espionage.
English is whisked away to an emergency meeting at Whitehall, where he is reunited with his endlessly patient fighting partner, Bough, still played by Ben Miller.
Bough is already a family man, married to a submarine commander whose role as Vicki Pepperdine doesn't seem to entitle her to any rights.
So the disastrous Batman and Robin have returned to Her Majesty's Secret Service to face the fatal supervillain Ophelia Bhuletova, played by Olga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister is being manipulated by a charismatic IT billionaire, Jake Lacys, played by Jason Volta, who claims to be able to solve Britain's computer problems.
English and Bough's odyssey becomes a farce: the two masquerade as waiters set fire to a fine French restaurant and cause chaos in their attempt to secretly steal Volta's luxury yacht.
The last obstacles of the filmmakers are removed as the final scene unfolds, but despite all the powerlessness and all the charm, the film still feels a little made for a child audience.
I think you can call this a moderate film.
I've seen a lot of Johnny English movies before and I've come to the same conclusion: Why is the British film industry incapable of giving Rowan Atkinson a role that would do justice to her talent?
The British Labour Party is contesting plans for a four-day work week with five-day wages.
Labour, led by Jeremy Corbyn, is considering a radical plan that would see Britons working four days a week, but paid for five days.
The party is said to demand that business leaders transfer the savings from the artificial revolution to workers in the form of extra days off.
The plan would allow workers to enjoy three days of weekends for the same pay.
Sources say the idea fits into the party's economic programme and plans to tilt policy in favour of workers.
The central organisation of trade unions supports the move to a four-day working week as a way for workers to benefit from the changing economic situation.
A senior Labour Party source told the Sunday Times: "The revision of the line was announced before the turn of the year.
The change will not happen overnight, but the four-day working week is an objective that fits in with the party's approach to balancing the economy for the benefit of workers and the party's overall industrial strategy.
Labour is not the first to support the idea: Britain's Green Party committed to supporting a four-day working week in its 2017 referendum campaign.
But it's not an objective that will receive unprecedented support from the Labour Party.
A Labour spokesman said: "The four-day working week is not the party line and the party is not considering such a move".
Shadow Chancellor of the Exchequer John McDonnell took advantage of a conference call last week to lay out his vision for an economic revolution.
McDonnell said he was determined to take power back from "deadbeat dictators" and "profit-seeking corporations".
According to the plans of the Shadow Treasury Minister, the current shareholders of the water companies would not be able to recover their shares in full, as the Labour-led government could implement 'reductions' based on the abuses found.
He also confirmed plans to put workers on company boards and create inclusive ownership funds, which would transfer 10% of the share capital of private sector companies to employee control, with a maximum of £500 paid in dividends per employee per year.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy are discussing on 60 Minutes whether the FBI's investigation into Kavanaugh could change their minds.
The FBI's investigation into the allegations against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed the final vote on Kavanaugh's nomination to the Supreme Court for at least a week, raising questions about whether the outcome of the investigation will undermine some Republican Senators' support for Kavanaugh's nomination.
On a Sunday episode of 60 Minutes, program correspondent Scott Pelley asked Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if there was any possibility that the FBI might learn something that might change their minds.
Kennedy was more open than his South Carolina counterpart.
"Of course", said Kennedy.
I said when I went to the hearing... I said I had a conversation with Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after this happened, when the allegations came out, and I asked him, "Did you do it?"
He was determined, decisive, unambiguous.
Graham's voice, on the other hand, sounds like a rock being beaten.
"I've made my decision about Brett Kavanaugh and it's bomb-proof", he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I do know this: Brett denied it outright", Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
 None of the people he named could confirm the story.
This is 36 years old.
I don't see how that could be changed.
What is the Global Citizen Festival, and what has it done to reduce poverty?
The Global Citizen Festival, which takes place in New York City on Saturday, is a music event whose lineup is as impressive as its mission: to eradicate poverty from the world.
Now in its seventh year, the Global Citizen Festival draws tens of thousands of people to the lawns of New York's Central Park to hear performers such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to make known the event's true mission: to end extreme poverty by 2030.
Launched in 2012, the Global Citizen Festival is a continuation of the Global Powerty Project, an international advisory group that aims to eradicate poverty by increasing the number of people who take active action to eradicate poverty.
To get a free ticket to the event (if you are not willing to pay for a VIP ticket), the public has to perform various tasks or 'acts' such as volunteering, sending an email to a political decision-maker or making a phone call, or performing some other act that spreads awareness of the project's objectives.
But how has Global Citizen succeeded now that we only have 12 years to go?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert ticket a real way to get people to take action, or is it just one 'clicktivism' among others - the illusion that you can change the world by signing an e-mail address or sending a tweet?
Global Citizen reports that it has recorded over 19 million 'acts' for various purposes since 2011.
It says these actions have encouraged policy makers to announce commitments and principles worth over $37 billion, and spent in a way that will affect the lives of over 2.25 billion people by 2030.
As of early 2018, the group listed 390 commitments and declarations, from which more than $10 billion has already been spent or raised.
The group estimates that the funds so far have impacted the lives of nearly 649 million people worldwide.
The most important commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a UK-based group of investors and activists committed to 'helping children develop to their full potential', which pledged to provide $35 million to Rwanda to end malnutrition in the country, after receiving 4,700 tweets from activists as part of the Global Citizen campaign.
"Thanks to the British government, donors, governments of different countries and global citizens like you, we can put a history of social injustice and malnutrition in the newspapers", said Tracey Ullman, Power of Nutrition ambassador, to the audience at a concert in London in 2018.
The group also urged the UK Government to take action to improve nutrition for mothers and children by means of more than 5 000 actions, and announced funding for the Power on Nutrition project, which aims to tackle malnutrition by reaching 5 million mothers and children.
One of the frequently asked questions on the movement's website is: 'How do you think we can end extreme poverty?'
Global Citizen's answer: "The road ahead will be long and difficult, with many stumbling blocks.
But we will succeed, as the great civil rights and anti-apartheid movements before us did, because together we are stronger.
Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman will be headlining the movement's New York concert this year, and its star guard includes artists such as Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Monáe.
The US Department of the Interior says the country could hinder energy exports by using its navy as a "block".
The Washington Examiner quoted US Interior Secretary Ryan Zink as saying that Washington could 'recourse to the help of its navy if necessary' to prevent the spread of Russian energy on world markets, including the Middle East.
Zinke claims that Russian activity in Syria  at the invitation of the legitimate government  is a pretext for exploring new energy markets in the region.
"I believe that the reason [for Russia's] presence in the Middle East is to transfer energy, just as in Eastern Europe, in the southern hemisphere of Europe", Zinken is reported to have said.
According to the Governor, there are ways and means to prevent this.
The US has the ability to keep shipping lanes open with its navy and, if necessary, with a blockade to ensure that the energy they supply does not end up on the world market, he says.
Zinke spoke to an audience at an event organised by the Energy Consumers Association, a non-profit group that is 'the voice of energy consumers' in the United States.
He went on to compare Washington's approaches to Russia and Iran, pointing out that they were one and the same.
'The economic alternative between Iran and Russia is more or less a gamble, and replacing one fuel with the other', he says, describing Russia as 'a one-trick circus' with an economy based on fossil fuels.
The statements come amid an effort by the Trump administration to boost LNG exports to Europe to replace the much cheaper Russian LNG.
To make this happen, the Trump administration, including President Trump, is trying to persuade Germany to withdraw from the illegal Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which President Trump says ties Berlin to Moscow's barrier.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which is intended to double the 110 billion cubic meters of transport capacity of the existing pipeline, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin claims that Washington's resistance is based on purely economic reasons, and considers it an example of unhealthy competition.
'I think we share the view that energy cannot be a tool of pressure and that consumers should have a choice of its supplier,' said Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak after meeting US Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The US position has provoked a backlash in Germany, which has confirmed its commitment to the project.
The country's leading industry umbrella, the German Confederation of Industry, has urged the United States to stay out of the EU's energy policy and the bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
'I find it very problematic that a third country interferes with our energy supply', said Dieter Kempf, head of the Federation of German Industries, after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren, Senator from Massachusetts, is considering a run for the presidency in 2020
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren announced Saturday that she's "carefully considering" running for president after the midterm elections.
Warren confirmed that he was considering running for president at an open hearing in Holyoke, Massachusetts.
"It's time for women to move to Washington and fix our broken government, and that means women in leadership positions in the nation", she said, according to The Hill.
After November 6th, I will consider carefully whether to run for president.
Warren criticized President Donald Trump during the event, saying that he is taking the country in the wrong direction.
"I'm worried about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy", he says.
Warren has come out as a straight-talker when criticizing Trump and his Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said, "I guess we need an FBI investigation before we vote".
But a poll released Thursday showed a majority of Warren's constituents are not in favor of his running for president in 2020.
A poll conducted by Suffolk University's Institute for Policy Studies and the Boston Globe found that 58% of "unlikely" voters in Massachusetts do not support the senator's candidacy.
32% were in favour of being nominated.
The poll showed that the majority of those who voted for the nomination of former Governor Deval Patrick was 38%, while 48% opposed the idea.
Other prominent Democratic candidates for the 2020 election have emerged from the debates, including former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
The Associated Press reports that Biden has said he will make a formal decision on his candidacy by January.
Sarah Palin referring to her son's war trauma during Donald Trump's campaign speech.
Sarah Palin's son, Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after he joined the Army in September.
Track Palin was arrested Monday night and charged with domestic violence.
"What my own son is going through after he comes home, I can very well relate to other families who are going through the effects of PTSD and the injuries that our returning soldiers are going through", he told an audience at Donald Trump's inauguration in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called the arrest "a river horse in the living room", and said his sons, like other veterans, "will come home a little changed, they'll come home hardened, they'll come back wondering if what he and his comrades in the Army and Air Force have done for this country is being honored".
Track Palin was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and according to Wasilla Police spokesman Dan Bennett, he was charged with domestic violence and assault of a woman, as well as domestic violence and possession of a weapon while intoxicated.
18 states and the District of Columbia support the lawsuit against the new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia are appealing a new policy in the United States that would deny asylum to people fleeing gang or domestic violence.
Representatives from 18 states and the federal district left a letter Friday in Washington, D.C., from Friends of the Court, a group of people who support asylum seekers who break the line, according to NBC News.
The plaintiff's full name has not been disclosed in the so-called Grace v. Sessions lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union in August against the federal government's position.
He tells of the abuse he suffered by his partner and his sons, who were members of a violent gang, and of the denial of asylum by the US authorities on 20 July.
He was arrested in Texas.
The attorney general who supported Grace described El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala, where a large proportion of the asylum seekers in the United States are from, as states where gang and domestic violence are a pervasive problem at all levels of society.
The new US asylum policy overturned a 2014 decision by the Asylum Appeals Board that undocumented migrants could apply for asylum based on domestic violence.
In a statement on Friday, District Attorney Karl Racine of Columbia said the new policy "ignores decades of state, federal and international law".
Federal law requires that all asylum applications be decided on the basis of the facts and circumstances of the individual application, and this kind of obstacle violates this principle, says the Friends of the Right letter.
The prosecutors also argue in the letter that the practice of denying asylum seekers entry harms the U.S. economy because newcomers are likely to become entrepreneurs and "create the necessary additional workforce".
In June, Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges to suspend asylum for victims of domestic violence and gang violence fleeing their homes.
Asylum is for people fleeing their country of origin because of persecution or fear of persecution because of their race, religion, nationality, or membership of a particular social group or political opinion Sessions announced the new asylum policy in his June 11 statement.
Asylum was never intended to solve all the problems - even the serious problems - that people face every day all over the world.
Desperate rescue efforts continue in Palos  The number of casualties has already doubled
For those who survive, the situation is even more serious.
'The situation is very tense,' says 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma as she comforts her fevered baby at an evacuation center in the ruined city of Ploiesti.
The ambulances are bringing new bodies every minute.
Clean water is in short supply.
Residents return to their destroyed homes, pick up their stolen belongings, and try to save what can still be saved.
Hundreds of people are injured and hospitals damaged by the 7.5 magnitude quake are full.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who suffers from a fractured spine and shoulder, are lying outside the Palun Army Hospital, where patients are being treated for the continuing, powerful aftershocks.
His eyes fill with tears as he relates how a violent earthquake shook the fifth-floor hotel room he shared with his wife and daughter.
We didn't have time to save ourselves.
I was squeezed between the debris of the wall, I think. Harris told the Associated Press that he and his family were in town as wedding guests.
I heard my wife screaming for help, and then it got quiet.
I don't know what happened to her or my baby.
I hope they're safe.
The US ambassador accuses China of "provocation" and "propaganda"
The US ambassador to China accuses Beijing of using the American newspaper as a propaganda tool, a week after a Chinese newspaper published a four-page ad in a US daily newspaper extolling the mutual benefits of a US-China trade agreement.
US President Donald Trump on Wednesday referred to a paid-for China Daily ad in the Des Moines Register, Iowa's largest newspaper, after accusing China of meddling in the November 6 congressional elections.
Trump's allegations of Beijing's attempts to interfere in the US elections mark a new stage in Washington's expanding campaign to put pressure on China, according to US officials who spoke to Reuters.
While it is normal for a foreign government to spread ads to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently locked in an ever-escalating trade war, with each side taking turns imposing tariffs on the other's exports.
Chinese and American experts believe that China's retaliatory tariffs were initially targeted at states like Iowa that supported Trump's Republican Party.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and longtime governor of Iowa, says Beijing has done damage to the American workforce, farmers and businesses.
China is now "further escalating its provocations by publishing propaganda in our own free press", Branstad wrote in an opinion piece published in the Des Moines Register on Sunday.
"In elevating its propaganda, the Chinese government is taking advantage of the United States' esteemed tradition of free speech and press by placing a paid advertisement in the Des Moines Register", Branstad writes.
Instead, the newspaper headlines in Beijing show only limited dissent, and the real dissent that Chinese citizens may have about the alarming development of their economy is not seen at all, because the media is tightly controlled by the Chinese Communist Party, she writes.
Branstad goes on to say that one of China's largest newspapers turned down an offer to publish an article he wrote, but does not specify which newspaper.
The Kavanaugh fiasco is driving out women voters from the Republican Party, analysts warn.
The fact that many of the Republican leadership are standing behind and defending Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh could cause a backlash, according to analysts, especially among female voters in the upcoming midterm elections.
The emotion surrounding the case has been high-profile, and most Republicans have already indicated they want to move forward with the vote.
"These things cannot be undone", says Grant Reeher, professor of political science at the Maxwell Institute at Syracuse University, in an article published Saturday in The Hill.
Reeher doesn't believe that Senator Jeff Flake's last-minute offer of an FBI investigation will appease angry voters.
'Women don't forget what happened yesterday and they won't forget tomorrow or in November,' says Karine Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and spokesperson for the national reform group MoveOn, according to a newspaper in the capital on Friday.
On Friday morning, protesters chanted "November is coming" as they demonstrated in the halls of the Senate Judiciary Committee as the Republicans in power decided to move forward with the Kavanaugh nomination, despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, Mic reports.
'Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will no longer be measurable' says Stu Rothenberg, a non-committed political analyst, in an interview with a news agency.
"People say the enthusiasm has already been high, and it's true.
But it could be even bigger, especially among the insecure women voters in the suburbs and the younger voters, the 18-29 year olds, who don't vote often because they don't like the president.
Analysts anticipate a possible backlash if Republicans move ahead with confirmation before Ford's testimony against the Supreme Court nominee, in which he made his allegation of sexual harassment.
"This is becoming a turmoil for the Republican Party", Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, told NBC News earlier this week.
"It's not just about the committee vote or the final vote or whether to put Kavanaugh on the table, it's about how Republicans have acted and how they've treated Ford", Guy Cecil, the head of the pro-Democratic Priorities USA group, told the news channel.
However, the Americans seem to be somewhat divided as to whether they should believe the testimony of Ford or Kavanaugh, with a narrow majority leaning toward the latter.
A new poll by YouGov found that 41% of respondents believe Ford's testimony absolutely or probably, while 35% say they believe Kavanaugh absolutely or probably.
In addition, 38% say they think Kavanaugh probably or definitely lied in his testimony, while only 30% said Ford did.
With Flake's case moving forward, the FBI is investigating Ford and at least one other allegation made by Deborah Ramirez, The Guardian reports.
Ford testified before the Judiciary Committee under oath that Kavanaugh molested her while he was drunk when Ford was 17.
Ramirez claims the Supreme Court nominee revealed his genitals to him at a fraternity party while they were students at Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web is planning to launch a new Internet as a counter-attack to Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, has started a startup company that aims to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The tech legend's latest project, Inrupt, is a company based on Berners-Lee's open source Solid platform.
Solid allows users to decide where their data is stored, and who has access to any data.
In an interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee jokes that Inrupt's purpose is to "take over the world".
"It has to be done now", he said, referring to his startup.
There is a historical moment.
The application uses Solid technology to enable people to create their own 'personal data repository', or POD.
It may include contact lists, memory lists, a calendar, a music library, and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify all being accessed by one browser at the same time.
The unique feature of a personal data repository is that it is entirely up to the user to decide which type of data he or she has access to.
The company calls it 'personal empowerment through information'.
According to the company's CEO, John Bruce, the idea behind Inrupt is to provide the resources, processes and skills required to bring Solid to everyone.
The company currently comprises Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform bought by IBM, some of the hired developers working on the project, and a community of volunteer coders.
Developers around the world can create their own decentralized applications using the tools available on the Inrupt website, all of which will be available starting this week.
Berners-Lee says that he and his team are not discussing with Facebook and Google whether to offer people a complete transformation where all their business models are turned upside down overnight.
We don't ask their consent.
In an article published on Medium on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt's "mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem for the integrity and quality of the new Solid-built network".
In 1994, Berners-Lee revolutionized the Internet by founding the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
Over the past few months, Berners-Lee has been a powerful voice in the net neutrality debate.
Berners-Lee retains his position as founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute even after the launch of Inrupt.
'I am extremely optimistic about the next era of the web,' added Mr Berners-Lee.
Bernard Vann: a town commemorates the heroic priest of the First World War
The city is commemorating the only priest in the Church of England to be awarded the Victoria Cross for his military service, 100 years after the events.
The Medal of Honor was awarded to Lieutenant Colonel, Reverend Bernard Vann, for his actions on September 29, 1918, during the attack on the villages of Bellenglis and Lehaucourt.
Vann, however, was killed by a sniper's bullet four days later, never to learn of the highest British military decoration he had ever received.
Two of his grandchildren were unveiling a memorial stone at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, last Saturday.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Vann, says the event is "impressively symbolic"; the monument was unveiled exactly 100 years after his grandfather's award-winning heroic deed.
According to the London Gazette, on 29 September 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Vann led his battalion across the Canal de Saint-Quentin in a very dense fog and under heavy fire from field guns and machine guns.
Later, he rushed to the front line and, in a display of the greatest courage, led the advance of the troops before attacking the field guns alone.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, just a month before the war ended.
Michael Vann, 72, said that his grandfather's work was "something I could never achieve, something to be admired for".
Michael Vann He and his brother Dr. James Vann were playing the trumpet after a parade by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann says it is 'a great honour to be part of the parade' and added: 'A great crowd is commemorating the honour of a true hero.'
The liberationists stayed up all night for the Bellator 206 tournament.
Imagine a situation where you've been up all night watching the highly anticipated Bellator 206 tournament, and the whole event isn't even played.
The San Jose event featured 13 matches, including six first-class matches, and was scheduled to be broadcast live on Britain's Channel 5.
At 6 a.m., just as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing for the ring, the program was changed to the great surprise of the audience of Pippi Longstocking.
Some of the spectators were not particularly happy after staying up all night to watch the match.
One friend of the match opens up on Twitter describing the replacement of the match with a cartoon of children as "some kind of sick joke".
'The law made that content unsuitable for 6am, so they had to switch it to a children's programme,' explained Dave Schwartz, Bellator's senior vice president of marketing and communications, on the switch.
"Piggy Piggy, yes, that is".
Scott Coker, the chief executive of Bellator, said the timetables would be worked out so that UK viewers could follow the events in the future.
"I'm thinking of a re-broadcast, which will probably get the programme running", Coker said.
However, it is six o'clock in the morning there, and we cannot get the program on before Sunday, our time, which is Monday, their time.
We're working on it.
You can believe that when the program changed in their minds, messages started to flow back and forth, and not all of them were friendly.
We tried to fix the error because we thought it was a technical problem.
However, this was not the case; it was a legal matter.
I can promise you that next time, this won't happen.
We're limiting the number of matches instead of the usual five or six, and we're trying to give our fans more, and we're trying too hard.
This is a very unfortunate situation.
Tom Daley felt inferior because of his sexuality .
Swimmer and Olympic athlete Tom Daley says that he felt inferior to everyone because of his sexuality, but that it was this that motivated him to succeed.
The 24-year-old athlete says it was not until he was in high school that he realized that "not everyone is like me".
Speaking on Radio 4's Desert Island Discs, hosted by Lauren Laverne, Daley said he spoke about gay rights to give others hope.
She also tells how, after having a child, winning the Olympics was no longer so important.
Kristy Young, longtime host of the nationally syndicated radio show, has taken several months off due to illness.
In a guest appearance on Laverne's first program, Daley said that as a young man he felt "smaller" than everyone else because "it wasn't socially acceptable to like boys and work".
She relates: "To this day, these feelings of inferiority and difference have been real, and they have given me the strength and energy I needed to succeed".
She says that she wanted to prove herself "something" so that she would not disappoint everyone when her sexuality was finally revealed.
The two-time Olympic bronze medalist has become a high-profile LGBT activist, and she's appearing at this year's Commonwealth Games to call for the criminalization of homosexuality in other countries.
He said he came forward because he felt lucky to be able to live openly without consequences, and wanted to give hope to other people.
The three-time world champion tells of her love for the man she met in 2013 - American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black - who was a surprise.
Daley married this Oscar winner 20 years his senior last year, but says the age gap has never been a problem.
"If you experience so many things at such a young age", says Daley, "you're going to have to go through the same ups and downs as your father, who died of cancer three years later, and you're going to have to go through your first Olympics at 14".
The couple had a son in June, Robert Ray Black-Daley, and as a result, Daley's whole perspective has changed.
"If you had asked me last year, my life would have been about winning a gold medal", he says.
You know, there are bigger things than an Olympic gold medal.
Robbie is my Olympic gold medal.
His son was named after Daley's father, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 from brain cancer.
Daley said that his father never accepted that he was going to die, and one of the last things he asked Daley was about his 2012 Olympic tickets.
"I couldn't tell him he wasn't going to be around to be in the front line anymore", says Daley.
"I held her hand when her breathing stopped, and it was only when it had stopped and she was dead that I finally understood that she was not invulnerable", she says.
The following year, Daley competed in the 2012 Olympics and won bronze.
"I knew this was something I'd dreamed of my whole life", says Daley, "jumping in front of the home crowd at the Olympics.
This was also the inspiration for her first song selection on the show  Heather Small's song Proud  which aroused emotions already in her preparation for the Olympics, and which still gets her skin on a chicken.
Desert Island Discs is broadcast on BBC Radio 4 on Sundays at 11:15 BST.
Mickelson, half-worn, on the bench for Saturday's Ryder Cup.
Phil Mickelson, the American, will break the record on Sunday, playing in his 47th Ryder Cup, but he will have to make a big effort to avoid making the record-breaking run a bad omen.
Mickelson, who will play in the biennial event for a record 12th time, was replaced by captain Jim Furyk for Saturday's fourball and foursome.
Usually the center of attention, the five-time major champion now spent half the day as a cheerleader and the other half on the court trying to get his bat under control.
Mickelson, 48, who was not even considered one of the world's most accurate drivers at the peak of his career, is not the ideal choice for the tight Le Golf National, where a tall, rugged man punishes the sloppy of his strokes.
If there's not enough competition for Mickelson on the court itself, in game nine on Sunday, he'll be facing accurate British Open winner Francesco Molinari, who will play alongside rookie Tommy Fleetwood, who is aiming to take all four wins this week.
If the Americans, who are four points behind in the 12th game of the doubleheader, get a flying start, Michelson's game could prove to be extremely important.
Furyk has expressed his confidence in his player, but what else could he say in this situation?
"He fully understands the role he played today, and he patted me on the back, and he said he was ready for tomorrow", Furyk said.
He's got a lot of confidence.
He's one of the best players in the game, and he's brought so much to his team in the past, and this week.
I probably didn't think he'd play two games.
I thought it would be different, but it was like this, and this is the solution we came up with.
He wants to be on that field as much as anybody else.
Mickelson will break Nick Faldo's record for most Ryder Cup games played on Sunday.
It could also mean the end of a man's Ryder Cup career, which, admittedly, was never as good as his personal record.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven halves, but Furyk says his presence brings something indescribable to the team.
"He's funny, sarcastic, smart, likes to joke at people's expense and he's a funny guy that everybody likes to hang out with", he explains.
I'm sure the younger players had a lot of fun with him this week, too.
He brings so much more to the team than just his contribution to the game.
Team Europe captain Thomas Bjorn knows how quickly a long lead can be lost
Thomas Bjorn, captain of the European team, knows from experience that the great lead in the Ryder Cup before the final day's doubles can be a bumpy ride.
The Danish player made his debut in 1997 in Valderrama, where the Seve Ballesteros-led side had a five-point lead over the Americans, but who emerged victorious with a lime line just and just the length of his nose and won by the narrowest possible margin of 141⁄2131⁄2.
"It reminds me of how we led brilliantly in Valderrama, we led brilliantly in Brooklyn where we lost, but we won in Valderrama, albeit narrowly", said Bjorn after watching the 2018 team's 53 wins both on Friday and yesterday as they moved to a 10-6 lead at Golf National.
History will show me and all the other members of this team that this is not over.
Tomorrow we'll be shooting with a big caliber.
We're gonna go out there and we're gonna do everything right.
The game's not over until the numbers are on the board.
We have a goal, we're trying to win that prize, and we're aiming for that.
As I've always said, I'm focused on these 12 players who play for us, but we're aware of what's on the other side: the best players in the world.
Enchanted by how his teammates have coped with a difficult pitch, Bjorn adds: 'I never lick before I fall in such matters.
Tomorrow is a different matter altogether.
Tomorrow, we'll focus on individual achievements, and then we'll talk about different things.
It's great to be on the court with a partner when everything is going well, but when you're on the court alone, that's when a player's capacity is tested to the core.
This is a message that must be conveyed to the players... for tomorrow's best performance by all.
Now we have to give up the partner who has to go [to the field alone] and do his best.
Unlike Bjorn, the opposing captain, Jim Furyk, will require his players to perform better as individuals than they did as partners, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who collected three points out of four.
Furyk, on the other hand, has experienced the last day's ups and downs, having been part of the team that won in Brooklyn before losing when the European team won in Medina by a miracle.
"I remember every curse word", he said in response to a question about how Ben Crenshaw, captain of the 1999 team, stretched his team's lines to the last day of the season.
We have 12 important games tomorrow, but we want to get a quick start just like what happened in Brooklyn, or like what happened in Medina.
When you get the action moving in one direction, it puts a lot of pressure on the middle games.
We've adjusted our lineup accordingly and we're putting the boys on the field the way we want to, as you know, we're going to do wonders tomorrow.
Thomas is tasked with leading the defence, and he's facing Rory McIlroy in the main match, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter in the next match against their European opponents.
"I put the guys in this order because I think it's going to carry through the tournament", Bjorn commented on his selection for the doubles.
The new German battleship is delayed again.
The German navy's newest frigate was supposed to be commissioned in 2014 to replace an aging Cold War-era fleet, but it will be commissioned as early as next year due to faulty systems and skyrocketing costs, local media reported.
According to a military informant who spoke to Die Zeit, the commissioning of the first ship of the new Baden-Württemberg-class frigate has been postponed to the first half of 2019.
The ship was due to join the fleet in 2014, but worrying post-delivery problems have dogged the ambitious project.
The four Baden-Württemberg-class ships ordered by the Navy in 2007 are intended to replace the aging Bremen-class frigates.
According to the information available, they are equipped with powerful artillery, anti-aircraft and anti-surface missile systems and stealth technology, such as radar reflectivity and infrared and acoustic detection reduction technology.
The ship's long service life is also an important feature: the new frigates should be able to operate at sea for up to two years without any interruption in their home ports.
However, the continuing delays mean that the cutting-edge warships  purportedly designed to enhance German influence in the overseas territories  are already outdated by the time they enter service, notes Die Zeit.
The ill-fated F125 frigate made headlines last year when the German Navy formally refused to take the ship into service and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This is the first time the Navy has returned a ship after it's been delivered.
Little is known about the reasons for the return, but the German media have reported significant "software and hardware failures" that make the warship unsuitable for combat missions.
The software deficiencies are particularly important because the Baden-Württemberg class ships have a crew size of about 120, which is only half of the older Bremen class frigates.
It was also found that the vessel is significantly overweight, which reduces its performance and limits the fleet's options for future upgrades.
With a capacity of 7,000 tons, the Rheinland-Pfalz is believed to be twice as heavy as the ships of the same class used by Germany in World War II.
In addition to the defective equipment, the cost structure of the entire project is also becoming a problem.
The price reportedly rose to a staggering €3.1 billion from the original price of €2.2 billion.
The problems of getting new frigates into service have come to the fore, as the German naval power has recently been warned to shrink.
The head of the German Parliament's defence committee, Hans-Peter Bartels, pointed out earlier this year that the fleet's operational ships are 'getting smaller'.
The problem has grown over time, the authority said, because old ships have been decommissioned but new ones have not been delivered to replace them.
He complained that no Baden-Württemberg-class frigates had been accepted for service in the navy.
The Environmental Protection Agency is eavesdropping on the hidden lives of bats .
A new study in the Scottish Highlands is looking at how bats use the land to hunt for food.
It is hoped that the new study will shed new light on the behavior of these unique flying mammals and guide future conservation measures.
A study by scientists of the National Trust for Scotland is observing the monk and dwarf bat, as well as the earwig and the water-buffalo, in the botanical garden of Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
In the study, special recording devices are placed at key points in the area to monitor bat activity during the season.
The organisation's staff and volunteers also carry out mobile measurements using portable observation equipment.
The frequency of the spikes and the species involved are confirmed by expert analysis.
The results will be used to produce a habitat map and report, which will allow the behaviour of the bats to be represented in a scale diagram of the area.
Rob Dewar, the organization's conservation adviser, hopes the results will reveal which habitat areas are most important to bats and how different species exploit them.
The information is useful for planning habitat areas, such as the creation of meadows and the management of forest areas, taking into account bats and related species.
Bat populations in Scotland and throughout Great Britain have declined dramatically over the last hundred years.
Building and land development work threatens the bat's resting places and habitats.
Wind turbines and lighting may also pose a risk, as may flypaper and certain chemicals used in building materials, as well as attacks by pet rats.
Well, bats are not actually blind.
However, because of their nocturnal hunting habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes in catching prey.
The flies use sophisticated echolocation techniques to detect insects and obstacles on their flight path.
The National Trust for Scotland is an organisation dedicated to the protection of the countryside environment, maintaining over 270 historic buildings, 38 significant gardens and 76,000 hectares across the country  and they take butterflies seriously.
It employs 10 experts who carry out regular inquiries, inspections of resting places and, in some cases, animal rescues.
The organisation has even established Scotland's first and only bat sanctuary, on the grounds of Threave Manor in Dumfries and Galloway, which is home to eight of Scotland's 10 bat species.
According to the manager, David Thompson, the area is ideal for a resting place.
'Threave is very well suited for the rest of the year', he says.
We have old buildings and trees and, overall, a good environment.
Not everything is known about leopards yet, so our work here and in other parts of the organization helps us better understand what leopards need to thrive.
He stresses the importance of inspecting buildings for bats before undertaking any repair work, since the unintentional destruction of one bat resting place can result in the death of up to 400 female bats and their young, and the destruction of an entire local population.
Bats are protected animals and it is prohibited to kill, disturb or destroy their habitats.
Elisabeth Ferrell, a Scottish official of the Bat Conservation Society, is encouraging the public to get involved in conservation work.
He says: 'We still have a lot to learn about our bats, and we don't yet know how their populations are doing.'
Ronaldo denies rape charges as lawyers prepare to file a lawsuit against a German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo has branded the rape allegations against him as "fake news" and says people want to "promote themselves" by using his name.
Ronaldo's lawyers have taken action to sue the German magazine Der Spiegel, which published the allegations.
The Portuguese and Juventus striker has been accused of raping an American woman named Kathryn Mayorga in a Las Vegas hotel in 2009.
He allegedly paid the victim $375,000 for his silence, Der Spiegel reported Friday.
Ronaldo appeared in an Instagram live broadcast to his 142 million followers just hours after the allegations were made. The 33-year-old soccer player vehemently denied the allegations, describing them as "fake news".
No, no, no, no, no. I'm not going to do that.
What they've said today, fake news, five-time Ballon d'Or winner said to the camera.
They just want to promote themselves by using my name.
It's normal, you know.
They want to be famous by using my name, that's part of the job.
I am a happy man and everything is fine", the player continued smiling.
Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel over what they have called "unwarranted reporting of suspicions of privacy violations".
Lawyer Christian Schertz says the player is seeking compensation for "mental suffering commensurate with the severity of the violation, which probably means the most serious violation of personal rights in recent years".
The alleged incident is said to have occurred in June of 2009 in a suite at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
Ronaldon and Mayorgan are said to have frequented the nightclub and moved into the player's room, where he allegedly raped her anal, according to papers filed in the Nevada District Court of Clark County.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo went down on his knees after the alleged incident and told him that he was "99 percent a good guy", but that "one percent" was a disappointment.
According to the documents, Ronaldo has confirmed that the couple had sex, but that it was consensual.
Mayorga also claims that he visited the police station and shared photos of his injuries in the hospital, but later decided to mediate because he was "terrified of the possibility of retaliation" and "worried about being publicly humiliated".
The 34-year-old now says she's seeking to have the settlement process overturned because she's still traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was close to signing for Real Madrid at the time of the alleged Manchester United overhaul, and moved to Italian powerhouse Juventus for a $100 million deal.
Brexit: Britain should regret the end of car manufacturing forever
The UK would be 'forever lost' if it lost its position as the world's leading carmaker after Brexit, said the economy minister, Greg Clark.
He added that he was "worried" by the announcement by Toyota's UK unit that it would temporarily suspend production at its Burnaston plant near Derby if Britain left the EU without a deal.
"We need a contract", Clark says.
The Japanese automaker says the impact of the deadline delays will be seen in the loss of jobs if Brexit is concluded without a deal.
The Burnaston plant  where the Toyota Auris and Avensis models are made  produced almost 150 000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
My view is that if Britain abruptly leaves the EU at the end of March, our factory will have production interruptions, says Marvin Cooke, Managing Director of the Burnaston unit at Toyota.
Other British car manufacturers, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, have expressed fears about how cross-border trade will work in the event of Brexit.
BMW, for example, has announced that it will close its Mini factory for a month if Brexit is achieved.
The main concern, according to the car manufacturers, is the supply chain risks in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
The Toyota production line is run on a real-time JOT principle, with parts arriving at the factory every 37 minutes from their suppliers in the UK and the EU, and cars being built to order.
If the UK leaves the EU without a deal on 29 March, it could cause disruption at the border, which could lead to delays and shortages of parts, according to the industry.
Toyota has said that it is impossible to maintain overnight stock at its Derbyshire plant and that production will be halted.
Clark says Theresa May's EU relations plan is 'specially calibrated to avoid these checks at the border'.
'We need a deal, we want the best deal that we can get, which is not just a success in the current situation, but an opportunity that we have to take advantage of,' he said on BBC Radio 4's Today programme.
 Not only Toyota's but also other manufacturers' statements show that we must be able to continue the supply chains that have worked very well so far.
Toyota cannot say how long production would be halted, but warns that the additional costs would reduce the competitiveness of the plant and eventually lead to job losses.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked at Burnaston for 24 years and is the factory's trade union secretary, says that there is a growing concern among members: 'In my experience, lost jobs are never coming back.
A government spokesman says: 'We need to present a clear and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU.'
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein may be delayed again, White House announces
Donald Trump's challenging meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein may be "delayed for another week" because of the pending impeachment of Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh, the White House announced Sunday.
Rosenstein will oversee the work of special counsel Robert Mueller, who will investigate Russian interference in the election, the contacts of Trump's aides with Russia, and the president's possible actions to obstruct justice.
There have been rumours in Washington for months that Trump is planning to fire the Assistant Attorney General, which would jeopardize the impartiality of Mueller's investigation.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had discussed the possibility of secretly recording conversations with Trump, as well as the possibility of impeaching the president under the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein has denied the report's information.
Rosenstein visited the White House last Monday, and the purpose of the meeting is to inform the former Rosenstein of his resignation from office.
However, President Trump was on a visit to the United Nations in New York at the time, so the date of the meeting was announced as Thursday.
Trump said he would "not" prefer to fire Rosenstein, but the meeting was postponed because it coincided with a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing where Kavanaugh and one of his female accusers, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, were both witnesses.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week-long FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh, further delaying the Senate's vote on the bill.
Sarah Sanders, Trump's chief of staff, appeared on Fox News Sunday.
Asked about the Rosenstein meeting, Sanders said, "There's no date set for this, it could be next week, this week, it could be another week postponed due to everything else that's going on in the Supreme Court right now.
I'll see what I can do, but I always want to keep the press up to date.
Some reporters might disagree with this claim: Sanders has not held a White House press conference since September 10.
News anchor Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders says the lack of press events is due to reasons other than disgust at the attention-seeking nature of TV journalists, but he did say: "I deny the fact that they are attention-seekers".
But Sanders has indicated that there will be more direct contact between Trump and the press.
"The president is holding more question sessions than any president before him", he says, adding further evidence without quoting: "We've been looking at those numbers".
'Press conferences will still be held,' Sanders said, 'but it is infinitely better if the media has the opportunity to ask questions directly to the president of the United States than to have a conversation with me.'
We try to do this a lot, and you've seen us do this a lot in the last few weeks, and this is going to replace the press release so you can talk directly to the president of the United States.
Trump regularly answers questions as he leaves the White House or attends open events or press conferences with visiting dignitaries.
It's rare for a man to appear alone at a press conference.
This week in New York, the president may have pointed out the reason for this in an unobstructed and at times bizarre appearance before a gathering of reporters.
The Minister for Health wrote a letter to EU nationals working in the public health system in Scotland (NHS Scotland) about Brexit fears
The Minister for Health has written a letter to the Scottish healthcare workers from EU countries to express his gratitude and wishes for their continued presence in the country after Brexit.
The letter was sent by Jeane Freeman, a member of the Scottish Parliament, with less than six months to go before the UK leaves the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed to cover the costs incurred by EU citizens working in specialised public services applying for 'settled status'.
In his letter, Mr Freeman writes: 'During the summer, the negotiations on the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the EU have continued, with the outcome expected in the autumn.
The UK Government has also stepped up preparations for a possible no-deal withdrawal.
I know this is an uncertain time for all of you.
So I want to reiterate now how much we value the contribution of every employee, regardless of citizenship.
Colleagues from across the EU and beyond bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of healthcare and benefit patients and the communities we serve.
Scotland is definitely your home and we really want you to stay here.
Christion Abercrombie is in emergency surgery for a head injury.
Tennessee State Tigers quarterback Christie Abercrombie has been in emergency surgery after the team lost 31-27 to the Vanderbilt Commodores on Saturday, reports Tennessee reporter Mike Organ.
Tennessee State head coach Rod Reed told reporters the injury occurred just before halftime.
"He came to the sidelines and simply slipped into it", Reed says.
Coaches and medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen on the sideline before putting her on the floor and taking her to the sidelines for further evaluation.
A reporter from Tennessee State told WSMV's Chris Harris in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie has recovered from surgery at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that the "type/extent of injury is unknown at this time" and that Tennessee State is trying to determine when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie is a sophomore at Tennessee State University and is playing his first season with the team after transferring from Illinois.
He had five tackles on Saturday before he was taken off the field, making it a total of 18 tackles this season.
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher stamp duty when they buy property in the UK
Foreign buyers will be charged a higher stamp duty on their purchases of property in the UK, with the extra money to be used to help the homeless, according to the Conservative Party's new plans.
The amendment is designed to neutralize Corbyn's success in attracting young voters.
The increase in stamp duty applies to those who do not pay taxes to the United Kingdom
The Treasury expects to raise up to £120 million a year to help the homeless
Theresa May will announce today the increased stamp duty charged to foreign buyers when they buy property in the UK, with the extra money going to help the homeless.
The measure will be seen as an attempt to neutralize Jeremy Corby's efforts to attract young voters, who have made promises of more affordable housing and have focused on taxing the wealthy.
The stamp duty is levied on people and businesses that do not pay taxes to the UK, and the extra money raised is channelled into government action to alleviate the plight of the homeless.
The surcharge  added to the current stamp duty on top of the increases in double-dwellings and investment dwellings added two years ago  can be up to 3%.
The Chancellor of the Exchequer expects the increase to generate up to £120 million a year.
It is estimated that 13% of new housing in London is bought by non-UK residents, which raises prices and hinders the opportunities for first-time buyers in the condominium market.
Many wealthy areas in the UK - especially in the capital - have become 'suburbs' because many foreign property owners spend most of their time abroad.
The new line comes just weeks after Boris Johnson proposed lowering stamp duty as a way to make it easier for young people to buy their first homes.
He accused the big developers of keeping property prices high by buying land and not building, and urged Prime Minister May to abandon affordable housing quotas to fix the shameful situation of housing in Britain.
Corbyn has published a striking set of proposals for reforming the housing market, including rent controls and an end to 'indiscriminate evictions'.
The Commission is also proposing to extend the scope of the directive to include the areas of the environment and the environment policy.
Prime Minister May says: 'I said last year that I was going to dedicate my term as Prime Minister to the British dream that every generation should live better than the one before it' to bring it back.
This means fixing our broken housing market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and build their lives here.
But it cannot be right that people who do not live in Britain and businesses based abroad can buy houses as easily as hardworking British residents.
For too many people, owning a home has become too distant a dream, and the shame of homelessness remains a reality.
Jack Ross: My ultimate goal is to manage the Scotland national team
Sunderland manager Jack Ross says his 'ultimate goal' is to manage the Scotland team at some stage.
The 42-year-old Scot is excited about the challenge of bringing back the northeast corner of the country, currently ranked third in the British second division, to its former glory.
Ross moved to the Stadium of Lights this summer after guiding St Mirren back to the Scottish Premiership last season.
"As a player, I wanted to play for my country.
I got into the second team and that was it", Ross told BBC Scotland's Sportsound.
As a child, I often watched the Scotland games in the Hampden with my father, and it's something that has always drawn me back.
I'm only gonna get this opportunity if I succeed as a club manager.
Ross's predecessors as manager of Sunderland include Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio, who also managed the club.
The former Alloa Athletic manager says he was not worried about stepping into the shoes of his famous predecessors at a famous club, having previously turned down offers from Barnsley and Iptswich Town.
Right now, I measure my success by whether I can get this club back in the Premier League.
The club's structure and ability make it undoubtedly a member of the elite league, he says.
"It's not easy to get in, but I'd probably only consider myself successful if I could get the team back into the top flight".
Ross has been a manager for only three years, first as assistant manager of Dumbarton and then for 15 months on the Heats' coaching staff.
He then helped Allo to rise from the Third Division relegation and lifted St Mirren from the relegation zone to the Championship the following season.
Ross says he feels better now than he ever did during his playing career with Clydes, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
'I was probably at a real crossroads in my career', he recalls when he took over the reins at Alloa.
I honestly believe I'm better suited as a manager than a player.
It sounds strange, because I played well, made moderately good money, and was able to enjoy some relatively great successes.
But playing can be tough.
A player has to figure out all kinds of things every week.
I'm still going through the same things, like the stress and the pressure of the job, but leading a team feels like the right thing to do.
I always wanted to lead a team, and now I'm doing it for a living, and I feel better in my own body than I've ever felt in my adult life.
The full interview is being broadcast on Sportsound on Sunday, September 30th, on Radio Scotland at 12:00 and 13:00 BST.
The perfect time to enjoy a drink is Saturday at 5:30 p.m., research shows
The summer heat wave has kicked off Britain's struggling pubs, but at the same time added pressure to the food chains.
Statistics show that pub and bar chain sales increased by 2.7% in July, but restaurant revenues fell by 4.8%.
The figures were compiled by Peter Martin of CGA, a business consultancy firm, who said: 'The continuing sunny weather and England's longer than expected participation in the World Cup meant that July was a month like June with pub sales up 2.8%, while restaurants had a worse month.
The June decline in restaurant sales of 1.8 percent only worsened in July.
Pubs and bars that focused on drinking were the most successful, with like-for-like sales increasing more than the decline in restaurant sales.
Pubs that focus on food also suffer from the heat, but less dramatically than those that run restaurants.
Looks like people just wanted to go out drinking in their minds.
Sales of drinks in the company-run pubs and bars increased by 6.6% during the month, while food sales decreased by 3%.
Paul Newman of RSM, a consultancy firm in the leisure and hotel-restaurant sector, says: The results are a continuation of a trend which has been going on since the end of April.
Weather and large social or sporting events are increasingly the main factors affecting the out-of-home catering market.
It is no surprise that the restaurant chains continue to struggle, although the 4.8% annual sales decline is particularly acute now that the industry is currently struggling with cost pressures.
The long, hot summer could not have been worse for food-focused operators, and only time will tell if the August cooling temperatures will bring the industry a much-needed respite.
The total increase in sales of pubs and restaurants, including new restaurants, was 2.7% in July, reflecting a slowdown in the establishment of new brands.
The Coffer Peach Tracker is a barometer of UK pub, bar and restaurant sales, which collects and analyses performance data from 47 groups in the sector with a combined turnover of over £9 billion.
One in five children hide social media accounts from their parents
One in five children - some as young as 11 - hide social media accounts from parents and teachers, study shows
A study of 20,000 high school students revealed the growing phenomenon of fake Instagram accounts
The news raised concerns about the possibility of sharing sexually explicit content on accounts
20% of pupils said they would hold a 'final account' to be shown to parents
One in five children - some as young as 11 - create social media accounts that they hide from adults.
A study of 20,000 high school students revealed the existence of a rapidly growing number of 'Instagrammy' fake accounts, referring to the photo-sharing website Instagram.
The news has raised fears that the accounts could be used to publish sexually explicit content.
20% of pupils said they preferred to have their 'main account' cleared for their parents to see while they use other, private accounts.
A mother found messages written by a teenager who wished to be raped after stumbling upon her 13-year-old daughter's secret Web site.
A study by Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters' Consultative Council (HMC) found that 40 per cent of 11-18 year olds had two separate profiles, and half of the respondents admitted to having secret accounts.
HMC director Mike Buchanan says: 'It is alarming that so many teenagers feel tempted to set up online spaces where parents and teachers cannot find them.'
Eilidh Doyle  Athletes' votes  The Scottish Athletes' Council  The Commissioner for the Commissioner for the Commissioner for the Commissioner for the Commission
Eilidh Doyle has been elected to the Scottish Sports Council as a non-executive member and will attend the annual general meeting of the governing body.
The award is Scotland's most prestigious athlete, and the chairman of the board, Ian Beattie, describes it as a great opportunity for sporting decision-makers to benefit from the athlete's vast international experience gained over the last decade.
"Eilidh is highly respected by athletes in Scotland, the UK and internationally, and I am sure that Scottish athletes would benefit immensely from his appointment to the board", says Beattie.
Doyle says: 'I look forward to my role as the voice of the athletes and hope to be of some benefit and help steer Scottish sport in the right direction.'
The four-time Olympic gold medalist, American athlete who won the 200- and 400-meter races at the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta, and now a regular commentator for the BBC, lost his ability to walk as a result of a transient cerebral hemorrhage.
He tweeted: "A month ago I had a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors say that only time will tell if I'll recover and how well.
This has been a grueling job, but I have made a full recovery, have learned to walk again, and am now practicing agility!
Thank you for your encouraging messages!
An ad that compares mothers to cows is spreading opinions online
An advertisement by a breast- pump company that compares lactating mothers to milking cows has sparked controversy online.
Consumer-technology company Elvie has launched what it calls "the world's first silent, wearable breast pump", promoted with a tongue-in-cheek, music-video-style ad that describes the new pump's freedom for breast-feeding mothers.
Four real-life moms dance in a heaving hearse, with the following lyrics: "Yes, I'm milking myself, but the tail is not visible" and "If you haven't noticed, they're not udders, they're tits".
The chorus goes on: "Pump it out, pump it out, I'll feed my babies, pump it out, pump it out, I'll milk my ladies".
However, the ad on the company's Facebook page caused a discussion online.
The video, which has been viewed 77,000 times and received hundreds of comments, has sparked a mixed reaction from viewers, with many saying it makes a mockery of the daily "horrors" of the dairy industry.
 Using the milk in advertising this product was a very bad decision.
They have to get pregnant and give birth to produce milk, but their babies are stolen soon after birth", writes one commentator.
The Elvie breast pump fits seamlessly into the Elvie/Mother
Another viewer comments: Understandably, it is traumatic for both mother and baby.
But why not use them to promote breast-feeding to mothers who are allowed to keep their babies?
A third comment added: A totally out of touch ad.
The ad also gained some defenders: one woman admitted that she thought the ad was "blasphemous".
I think this is a great idea.
I'd get one of those if I was still breast-feeding.
Pumping made me feel like a cow.
It's a little crazy, but I took it for what it was.
This is a brilliant product, read one of the reviews.
Another viewer comments: "This is a funny ad for mothers who pump (often at work or in the bathroom) and feel like cows".
The aim of the advertisement is neither to praise nor to condemn the dairy industry.
At the end of the commercial, the women in the video reveal that they have danced with unnoticeable pumps tucked into their bras.
The concept of the advertising campaign is based on the idea that many women who use a breast pump feel like cows.
The Elvie pump, on the other hand, is completely silent, has no wires or hoses, and fits discreetly into the breast-feeding bras, giving women the freedom to move around, hold the baby, and even go outside while pumping.
Ana Balarin, partner and artistic director of Mother, commented: "Elvie's pump is a ground-breaking product that deserved a bold and provocative entry into the market.
By comparing breastfeeding mothers to milking cows, we wanted to bring all the challenges of using a breast pump into the spotlight, bringing the incredible sense of freedom that the new pump brings to life in a fun and relatable way.
The Elvie pump has made headlines before.
At London Fashion Week, the mother of two was seen on the catwalk wearing a costume by designer Marta Jakubowski.
Hundreds of migrant children were moved to a tented camp on the Texas border in complete silence.
The number of detained migrant children has increased sharply, even though the monthly number of border crossings has remained relatively unchanged, in part because of the Trump administration's harsh rhetoric and policies that have made it more difficult to place children in foster care.
Most foster families are traditionally composed of undocumented migrants, and registering as a foster family can jeopardise their own stay in the country.
The risk increased in June, when federal authorities announced that prospective foster families and other adult household members would be required to provide fingerprints and that this information would be shared with immigration authorities.
Matthew Albence, a senior Immigration and Customs Enforcement official, testified in Congress last week that the agency had detained dozens of people who had sought to foster underage immigrants.
The Bureau later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had no prior criminal record.
 Almost 80% of people who are either members of foster families or members of their households are in the country illegally, and a large number of them are criminal aliens.
So we're going to keep looking for these people", Albence says.
In an effort to speed up the handling of children's cases, the authorities have introduced new rules that in some cases require a trial within one month of the arrest, instead of the previous 60-day time limit, the reception centre staff said.
Many prefer to present their case via videoconference rather than in person in immigration courts.
Those not deemed eligible for aid will be expelled promptly.
Reception center staff and the system's reports published in recent months indicate that the time spent in custody affects whether children develop anxiety or depression, which can lead to violent outbursts or escape attempts.
According to the lawyers, the concern is particularly acute in larger institutions, such as Tornillo, where signs of a child's desperation may go unnoticed due to the size of the institution.
They add that moving children to tent cities without giving them enough time to prepare emotionally or to say good-bye to friends can cause trauma, and many children are suffering from trauma even now.
Syria orders US, French and Turkish 'fighter forces' to withdraw immediately
Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem, speaking at the UN General Assembly, also called for Syrian refugees to return home, even though the country has been at war for eight years.
Moualem, who also serves as deputy prime minister, said foreign troops were in the country illegally under the pretext of fighting terrorism and that "they will be dealt with accordingly".
'They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally,' he told the General Assembly.
Moualem claimed that the "war on terror" is almost over in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died in 2011 and since then, and where millions have been forced to flee their homes.
He said Damascus would continue its "holy struggle" until all of Syria was cleared of both terrorist organisations and "illegal foreign forces".
The United States has about 2,000 troops stationed in Syria, where they are mainly training and guiding the Kurdish and Arab forces opposing President Bashar al-Assad.
France has deployed over 1,000 troops to the battle to tear the country apart.
On the refugee issue, Moualem said conditions were good for returning people and accused some Western countries of spreading "irrational fears" that encourage refugees to stay away.
'We have invited the international community and aid organisations to facilitate these returns,' he said.
They politicize a cause that should be purely humanitarian.
The United States and the European Union have warned that no reconstruction aid will be given to Syria until the war is ended by a political agreement between Assad and the opposition.
UN diplomats say a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to create a buffer zone in the last rebel stronghold in Idlib has created an opportunity for political dialogue.
The Russian-Turkish agreement has prevented a large-scale attack by Russian-backed Syrian forces on the region, which is home to three million people.
However, Moualem has stressed that the agreement has 'clear time limits' and expressed the hope that military action would target jihadists, including fighters from the al-Qaeda-linked al-Nusra Front, 'who will be destroyed'.
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes to soon convene the first meetings of a committee of the new government and opposition members to draft a post-war Syrian constitution and pave the way for elections.
Moualem set conditions for the Syrian government's participation in the committee, saying its work should be limited to "reviewing articles of the current constitution" and warned against interference.
Why Trump will be re-elected for a second term
According to this logic, President Trump would win the 2020 election unless, as many liberal viewers probably hope, a viral panic and scandal prematurely ends his presidency.
This would be without a doubt the most dramatic presidential end ever!
So far, no signs of fatigue have been detected in the viewers.
Since 2014, prime-time viewership figures have more than doubled on CNN to 1.05 million and nearly tripled to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
Fox News averages 2.4 million viewers in its prime time, according to Nielsen, compared to 1.7 million four years ago, and MSNBC's Rachel Maddow Show has topped cable television with 3.5 million viewers as the top newscast.
'It's a threat that attracts people because it's something we don't understand,' says Neal Baer, executive producer of ABC's Designated Survivor programme, of the minister who becomes president after a congress building is destroyed in a strike.
Nell Scovelli, an experienced comedy writer and author of Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys Club, has another theory.
He remembers the taxi ride in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver said he was going to vote for Trump.
Scovell asked me why.
The driver said, "Because he makes me laugh", Scovell says.
Chaos has entertainment value.
Of course, unlike other TV programs, news from Washington can determine the outcome of Roe v. Wade, the ability of immigrant families to connect with one another, and the state of the world economy.
Indifference is a luxury afforded only to the most privileged of spectators.
And yet, it is beyond the bounds of civic duty to watch six hours of expert panel discussion about the use of source material by Bob Woodward for Fear, Paul Manafort's $15,000 ostrich-skin pilot ticket, and Stormy Daniels' unvarnished depictions of President Trump's anatomy.
I, for one, will never be able to watch Super Mario the way I used to.
"What he's doing feels like reality TV, in part because he's giving the audience something every night", says Wheelhouse Entertainment executive and Pledge House creator Brent Montgomery of Trump's show's changing characters and daily plot twists (NFL controversy, Kim Jong-un praise).
You can't miss an episode, or you'll fall off the wagon.
When I caught up with Mr. Fleiss this week, he was staying on the north coast of Kauai on a beautiful sunny day, but he couldn't go outside because he was watching MSNBC while he was taping CNN.
He couldn't get away from a program that had Brett Kavanaugh in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee, and it was about the future of the Supreme Court.
"I remember when we were doing all these crazy shows and people were saying that it was the beginning of the end of Western civilization", Mr. Fleiss said.
I thought it was a joke, but they were right.

Not surprisingly, Pennsylvania's 17th Congressional District has been facing a real cash flow, as two of the already elected candidates are already vying for the same seat due to congressional redistricting.
This newly redrawn Pittsburgh district is a battlefield challenge for Democrat Conor Lamb, who won the seat in the 2nd district in last spring's special election.
Lamb will be competing with another elected candidate, Republican Keith Rothfuss, who currently represents Pennsylvania's old 12th congressional district, which overlaps with the new 17th congressional district.
The redistricting was done after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old electoral division unconstitutionally favored Republicans.
The race in the new 17th district has sparked a financial battle in the main party funding departments of the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb's name became familiar in Pennsylvania after the widely followed special election in March for Pennsylvania's 18th congressional district.
The seat had been held by Republicans for more than a decade, and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 percent.
Political commentators have given the Democrats a nice lead.
The United States planned to punish El Salvador for supporting China, but backed off.
Diplomats have noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already noted the situation in Beijing and the mild reaction in Washington.
President Trump had a warm meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varella in June 2017 and also owned a hotel in Panama until the partners ousted the management team of the Trump Organization.
US State Department officials decided to recall American diplomatic chiefs from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama based on "recent policies that no longer recognize Taiwan", Department of State spokeswoman Heather Nauert said in a statement earlier this month.
However, sanctions were only considered for El Salvador, which received an estimated $140 million in U.S. aid in 2017, including for drug control, development and economic assistance.
The proposed penalties, which included cuts in financial aid and targeted visa restrictions, would have dealt a severe blow to the Central American country, which has high unemployment and homicide rates.
As the internal meetings progressed, the North and Central American authorities postponed a high-level meeting focused on security and economic prosperity, a meeting similar to the one held the previous year, seen as a step in efforts to discourage migrants from seeking to enter the United States.
But in mid-September, senior administration officials made clear that they wanted the meeting to move forward, and this effectively ended speculation about a possible punishment for El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence is now expected to give a meeting scheduled for mid-October some indication of the weight the administration will give to the gathering, diplomats said.
The three American ambassadors mentioned in the report quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without any further unpleasant messages or sanctions from Washington.
A White House spokesman for President John Bolton declined to comment on the details of the conversation with three U.S. officials, including two diplomats who agreed to discuss internal affairs anonymously.
Their report was confirmed by an outside analyst close to the administration, who also spoke on condition of anonymity.
What history teaches
The next inevitable step may be the report by Special Counsel Robert Mueller on President Trump's potential obstruction of justice, for which there is now very compelling evidence in public records.
Mueller has also been reported to be leading the investigation into whether the Trump campaign colluded with Russia in the days of Russian meddling in the US election.
If there is a change of power in Congress, President Trump will find himself accountable to it just as he prepares to go before his constituents again, and potentially be judged by his peers.
There's a lot of speculation here, and I'm not saying that President Trump's defeat is inevitable any more than the loss of the same people in Europe.
We have to make decisions on both sides of the Atlantic, and those decisions will determine how long this struggle will take.
In 1938, the German authorities would have been ready to overthrow Hitler if the West had also opposed him and supported the Czechs in Munich.
We failed, and we lost the chance to avoid the years of bloodshed that followed.
The course of history is marked by such turning points where the inevitable march of democracy either accelerates or slows down.
Americans are now facing several such turning points.
What are we going to do if President Trump fires Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who is in charge of the Mueller investigation?
Rosenstein has been under fire since it became public that he had proposed secretly recording the president's speech and contemplated the president's possible incompetence to handle his duties.
Rosenstein says the Times story is flawed.
How do we react if the newly-requested FBI investigation into Brett Kavanugh's activities is not complete or fair, or if he is confirmed to the Supreme Court despite credible allegations of sexual harassment and dishonest testimony?
And most importantly, in the midterm elections, will we vote for a Congress that holds President Trump accountable?
If we fail in these trials, our democracy will enter a long, dark winter.
But I believe we'll succeed because of the lessons I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Jew from Czechoslovakia and was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once filled my diplomatic cabin.
He survived, emigrated to America, and sent me 60 years later to light the Sabbath candles on that swastika-decorated table.

Rangers ' Graham Dorrans is optimistic about meeting Rapid Vienna .
Rangers will take on Rapid Vienna at home on Thursday, knowing that a draw against Villarreal in Spain earlier this month would give them a strong position in the Europa League G-Division.
A knee injury has kept midfielder Graham Dorrant out of action this season before a 2-2 game at Villarreal, but he believes the Rangers can use that result as a springboard to better results.
"It was a good result for us because Villarreal is a good opposition", the 31-year-old said.
We went into the game expecting to get something and carry a point.
Maybe we could have won the game in the end, but all in all, the tie is probably a fair result.
I think they were better in the first half and we got a little bit of momentum in the second half and we were better.
Thursday is another big night in the Europa League.
I hope we can get three points, but it's going to be a tough game because they had a good result in the last game, but I believe that with the support of this team, we can give everything and achieve a positive result.
Last year was really tough with my own injuries and the changes in the team, but I feel good now.
The line-up is good, the boys are enjoying it, the training is going well.
Hopefully, we can now press full steam ahead, put the past behind us and succeed.
The fear of retirement savings is keeping women up at night
Although the participants had a clear idea of how they wanted to be cared for, few had talked to their loved ones about it.
About half of the participants in the national survey said that they discuss long-term care costs with their spouses.
Only 10 percent of the respondents said they had discussed the matter with their children.
"People want a family member to take care of them, but they don't talk about it", says Holly Snyder, vice president of the National Life Insurance Company.
Start with this.
Talk to your spouse and children: You cannot prepare your family to care for you if you do not tell them your wishes in time.
Discuss with a professional and your family where and how to get help, as these questions are important cost determinants.
Involve financial advisers in the discussion: they can also help you find a way to cover these costs.
The financing options for long-term care may include traditional long-term care insurance, hybrid life insurance to cover these costs or self-funded insurance if you can afford it.
Draw up legal documents: prevent litigation.
Get a healthcare representative on site so that you can appoint a trusted person to oversee your medical care and ensure that professionals respect your wishes in case you are unable to communicate with them.
Consider also the possibility of drawing up a power of attorney for the management of your financial affairs.
It allows you to designate a trusted person to make financial decisions for you and to make sure that your bills are paid if you are unable to take care of them yourself.
Remember the small details too: Imagine that your elderly parent is on his way to the hospital because of a health emergency.
Can you answer any questions about his medication and allergies?
Write such information on the chart so that you are prepared for the situation.
"It's not just a question of money, but who is his doctor?" asks Martin.

Who's gonna take care of the dog?
Keep the plan ready.

The man was shot several times with an air rifle as he walked home late at night.
The victim, aged around 40, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe in Devon when he was shot in the chest, abdomen and arm.
Police are classifying the attack, which occurred at approximately 2:30 a.m., as an "accidental event".
The victim didn't see the attacker.
The victim's injuries are not life-threatening, and the police have relied on eyewitnesses.
The earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have been killed in a powerful earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palun on Friday, with officials saying the death toll is expected to rise.
Due to the disruption of communications, the rescue authorities have not received any information from the area north of Pyu in Donggala Municipality, which is closer to the epicenter of the 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
More than 16,000 people have been evacuated in the wake of the disaster in Palma.
Key facts about Palus and Donggala on Sulawesi Island:
Palu is the capital of the Central Sulawesi province, located at the end of a narrow bay on the western coast of Sulawesi Island, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The earthquake and tsunami hit in the middle of the city's 40th anniversary celebration.
The municipality of Donggala extends over 300 kilometers (180 miles) of the northwestern coastline of Sulawesi Island.
Donggalan Municipality is an administrative area under the province with an estimated population of 299,200 in 2017.
The main economic activities in Central Sulawesi Province, and in particular in the coastal area of Donggala, are fishing and agriculture.
Nickel mining is also important, but it is concentrated in Morowali on the coast opposite Sulawesi.
According to the Indonesian Disaster Mitigation Agency, Palu and Donggala have been hit by several tsunamis over the past 100 years.
In 1938, the tsunami killed over 200 people and destroyed hundreds of houses in Donggala.
The tsunami also hit the western part of Donggala in 1996, killing nine people.
Indonesia is located in the seismically active Pacific Ring of Fire and is frequently affected by earthquakes.
Some of the most severe earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A powerful earthquake in North Sumatra off the western coast of Aceh Province, Indonesia, caused a tsunami on 26 December that struck 14 states and killed 226,000 people along the Indian Ocean coast.
2005: A series of powerful earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8-magnitude earthquake struck the southern part of Indonesia's most populous island, Java, causing a tsunami that struck the island's southern coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: A 7.6 magnitude earthquake hit the city of Padang, the capital of West Sumatra province.
Over 1,100 people were killed.
2010: A 7.5 magnitude earthquake struck one of the Mentawai Islands in Sumatra, causing a ten-meter-high tsunami that destroyed several villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A superficial earthquake struck the Aceh Pidie Jaya area, causing devastation and panic as people remember the massive destruction caused by the 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
This time, no tsunami was generated, but over 100 people were killed when the buildings collapsed.
2018: Strong earthquakes hit the tourist island of Lombok in Indonesia, killing more than 500 people, mainly in the northern part of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and temporarily isolated thousands of tourists.
Sarah Palin's eldest son was arrested on charges of domestic violence.
The eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice presidential candidate Track Palin has been arrested on a charge of assault.
According to a Saturday morning police report, Palin, 29, of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence and obstruction of a domestic violence notice and resisting arrest.
According to the police report, Palin took the phone from her female companion when she tried to call the police to report alleged crimes.
Palin is being held in pretrial detention at Mat-Su Pretrial Prison and has been released on $500 bail, reports TV channel KTUU.
According to the report, Palin appeared in court on Saturday and pleaded "not guilty".
Palin is charged with three Class A felonies, which means he could be facing up to a year in prison and a $250,000 fine.
He's also charged with a Class B misdemeanor, which carries a maximum penalty of one day in jail and a $2,000 fine.
This isn't the first time Palin's been accused of a crime.
In December 2017, he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
That's when Palin's mother called the police and reported the assault.
The case is currently pending in the Alaska Veterans' Court.
In January 2016, Palin was charged with domestic violence, which involved possession of a weapon while under the influence of a drug.
Palin's girlfriend accused him of punching her in the face.
In 2016, Sarah Palin was criticized by veterans groups for linking her son's violent behavior to post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) caused by service in Iraq.
The earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia: hundreds of people killed
At least 384 people have been killed since an earthquake struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The 7.5 earthquake caused a tsunami that destroyed thousands of homes.
Power and communications are down, and the death toll is expected to rise in the coming days.
The earthquake struck just outside the central part of Sulawesi, northeast of the Indonesian capital, Jakarta.
Social media is running videos of the quake.
Hundreds of people had gathered for a beach festival in the town of Pulu when the tsunami hit the coast.
Federal prosecutors are considering a rare death sentence for the suspect in the New York City terrorist attack.
Federal prosecutors in New York are seeking the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect in the terrorist attack that killed eight people in New York City, a rare punishment that hasn't been carried out in the state for a federal crime since 1953.
According to the indictment, Saipov, 30, used a rented Home Depot car in an October assault on a bike path on the West Side Highway in lower Manhattan, where he ran over pedestrians and cyclists.
According to a death penalty application from the Southern District of New York, the death penalty is possible if prosecutors can prove that Saipov "deliberately" killed eight of his victims and "deliberately" inflicted serious physical injury.
According to the court's document, both of these charges are punishable by death.
Weeks after the attack, federal prosecutors charged Saipov with 22 counts, including eight counts of murder for aiding a terrorist organization, a term typically used by federal prosecutors in cases involving organized crime, and one count of violence and destruction of motor vehicles,
The attack required "considerable planning and preparation", and the prosecutors found and described the manner in which Saipov carried out his actions as "horrific, cruel and shameful".
'Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov has caused injury, harm and loss to the families of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decad, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruch, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco,' the statement of the prosecution said.
Five of the victims were Argentine tourists.
It has been a decade since the Southern District of New York last handed down a death sentence.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was found guilty of murdering two drug dealers, but was eventually sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last execution in New York in a federal case was in 1953, when a married couple, Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, were executed on charges of conspiracy to spy for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
Both Rosenbergs were executed in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to court documents, Saipov, a citizen of Uzbekistan, showed no signs of remorse in the days and months following the attack.
He told investigators he felt good about what he was doing, the police said.
According to the indictment, Saipov told authorities that he was inspired to carry out the attack after watching ISIS videos on his phone.
Police said Saipov also wanted an ISIS ticket for his hospital room.
He pleaded not guilty to 22 counts.
David Patton, one of the federal public defense attorneys representing Saipov, said the defense was "naturally disappointed" by the prosecutor's decision.
'We believe that the decision to demand the death penalty rather than recognition and life imprisonment without the possibility of release is a solution that only prolongs the trauma caused by these events to those involved,' said Mr Patton.
Saipov's defense had previously requested that he not be sentenced to death.
The Conservative MP says Nigel Farage should be put in charge of the Brexit negotiations.
Nigel Farage, at a rally today against the Conservatives, promised to "mobilize the people's army".
The former Ukip leader said politicians must feel the pressure of Eurosceptics - when one of Theresa May's own MPs suggested she lead the negotiations with the EU.
Peter Bone, the Conservative Party's leader, told the marchers in Birmingham that the UK would be out if Farage was Brexit Secretary.
But May faces a deeply divided ranks as she reconciles a challenge underscored by the pro-Remain Conservatives who joined the city's separate anti-Brexit demonstration.
The Prime Minister is struggling to keep his Chequers compromise proposal on the table in the face of Brexit supporters and opponents, and the EU.
Supporters are urging him to continue his efforts to reach an agreement with Brussels despite the setback and to force Eurosceptics and the Labour Party to make a choice between his proposal and chaos.
Bone said at the Leave Means Leave event in Solihull that he wanted to "shake the Chequers proposal off".
He suggested that Farage should be included and given responsibility for negotiations with Brussels.
"If he was in charge, we'd be out by now", he said.
The Wellingborough MP added: 'I am in favour of Brexit but the Chequers proposal must be dropped.'
He expressed his opposition to the EU, saying: "We did not fight the World War to become vassals.
We want to make our own laws in our own country.
Bone dismissed the idea that public opinion had changed after the 2016 vote: "The idea that the British people have changed their mind and want to stay is a completely false claim".
Conservative Brexiteer Andrea Jenkyns also joined the march and told reporters: "Just a word: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
The people will not support the Chequers proposal, the opposition will not vote for it, and it will not be supported by party members and activists who are really going to take to the streets and are ultimately responsible for our success.
Give up the Chequers proposal and start listening.
In a message to May, he added: 'Prime Ministers can keep their jobs if they keep their promises.'
Farage said politicians must feel the pressure if they are to overturn a decision made in the 2016 referendum.
The Commission is also proposing to extend the scope of the directive to include the areas of the environment, health and safety.
They're trying to water down Brexit and we're here today to tell them that we don't accept it.
Speaking to an enthusiastic crowd, he added: 'I want the politicians who are about to try to get Brexit done to feel the pressure from you.'
We are going to mobilise the army of the people of this country who gave us the victory in the Brexit vote and we will not rest until Britain is once again an independent, self-governing and proud nation.
Meanwhile, pro-Remain supporters marched through Birmingham ahead of a two-hour event in the city centre.
A small group of activists waving Tories Against Brexit banners formed this weekend.
Labour's Lord Adonis mocked the Conservatives for the security problems they had with the party app at the start of the meeting.
'These are the people who say they will get IT systems up and running and all the technology for the Canada plus plus scheme and the unclogged border offices for free trade in Ireland,' he added.
It's a farce.
There is no such thing as a good Brexit, he added.
Warren is seriously considering running for president .
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says she's seriously considering a run for president after the November election.
The Boston Globe reported that a Massachusetts Democrat spoke about his future at city hall in western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, who is known for his repeated criticism of President Trump, will face Republican Geoff Diehl, who was Trump's 2016 Massachusetts campaign co-chair, in the November re-election.
Warren has been speculated as a possible candidate against Trump in the 2020 election.
Saturday afternoon's event at the Holyoake was his 36th town hall meeting with voters since the start of Trump's term.
One of the attendees asked if Warren was considering running for president.
Warren said it was time for women to go to Washington to fix our broken government, and that includes a woman in the highest office.
Arrested in the LSU shooting of Sims
Police in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, announced Saturday that they have arrested a suspect in the shooting death of Wayde Sims, a member of the LSU basketball team.
Baton Rouge police reported that Dyteon Simpson, 20, was arrested at 11:00 a.m. ET.
Police had released a video of the shooting Friday night, asking for help identifying the man seen in the video.
Sims, 20, was shot near the Southern University campus early Friday morning.
"Wayde Sims suffered a gunshot wound to the head and died as a result", Police Chief Murphy J. Paul told the media on Saturday via 247 Sports Network.
Wayde was defending his friend when Simpson shot him.
Simpson admitted to being present at the interrogation, to having a weapon in his possession, and to shooting Wayde Sims.
Simpson was not resisting arrest and was taken to the East Baton Rouge Police Station.
Sims was a 6-foot-8 junior who grew up in Baton Rouge, played in 32 games with 10 starts last season and averaged 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
The Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaching the world championship after the team management offered him a victory over Sebastian Vettel
With Valtteri Bottas overtaking Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it became clear that Mercedes's team structure will play a big part in the race.
Bottas got off to a good start and almost left Hamilton to his own devices as he defended his spot in the first two rounds, inviting Vettle to his teammate's knock.
Vettel went to the steering wheel first, leaving Hamilton to drive the team with his tail, which should have solved the situation.
Mercedes then went to the pits later and returned to Vettel, but Hamilton moved after making some contact and the Ferrari driver unintentionally moving from the inside, giving up defending his position after only two-thirds of his turn.
Max Verstappen, celebrating his 21st birthday, started from the back row and was seventh after the first lap.
After that, he was in the lead for much of the race, extending the tyre change to aim for a quick finish and taking fourth place from Kimi Räikkönen.
He finally got to the wheel on lap 44, but was unable to add speed on the remaining eight laps as Räikkönen took fourth place.
This was a difficult day, for Valtteri had been doing brilliantly all weekend and was a real gentleman when he passed me.
The team has done an extraordinary job, achieving a double win", said Hamilton.
Very poor body language.
President Donald Trump, in a speech Saturday, mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein's claim that she did not leak a letter from Christine Blasey Ford accusing Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual harassment.
Speaking at a ceremony in West Virginia, the president did not directly mention Ford's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, but stated that what was going on in the Senate was a demonstration of the arrogance, the callousness and the dishonesty of the people.
"The one thing that's possible, the one wonderful thing that's been going on in the Senate these last few days, seeing the rancor, people who are angry, mean, vicious and dishonest", the president said.
When we see the publications and the leaks and then they say, "Oh, I didn't do it".
I didn't do it.
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you compile this data?
Do you remember his answer... did you leak the document... oh, what?
Oh, my God.
I didn't leak.
Now, wait a minute.
Did we... No, we didn't leak", he added, with a Senator in his sights.
Feinstein received a letter in July describing the allegations against Ford Kavanaugh and the letter was leaked in September, but Feinstein denied that the leak had occurred from his office.
"I didn't hide Professor Ford's allegations, and I didn't leak his story", Feinstein told the committee, according to The Hill.
He asked me to keep it confidential, and I kept it confidential, as he requested.
But his denial did not sit well with the president, who commented on the matter on Saturday's event: "Let me tell you, that was very poor body language.
Maybe he didn't do it, but that was the worst body language I've ever seen.
The president continued to defend the Supreme Court nominee, who has been accused of sexual harassment by three women, and said the Democrats are using the allegations to their advantage.
They are determined to get back to power by any means necessary.
You see the malice and the evil, they don't care who they hurt or who they have to walk over to get power and control.
The Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants are in the play-offs.
Patrick Dwyer scored two touchdowns for the Giants against Dundee.
Dundee Stars claimed a win in Friday's Elite League match against the Belfast Giants, beating Dundee 5-3 on Saturday.
The Giants had an early lead thanks to two goals from Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie brought home the game before Dwyer returned the Giants to the lead.
Francois Bouchard was able to draw Dundee before Lukas Lundvald's two goals ensured victory.
This was the third Elite League defeat of the season for the Adam Keefe men, who beat Dundee 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night.
The teams met for the fourth time in the season after the Giants had won the previous three games.
Dwyer's opening goal came in the fourth minute at 3:35 from Kendall McFaul, with David Rutherford scoring, while Beauvillier doubled the lead four minutes later.
In a fast-paced opening round, Sullivan brought the home team back in the game at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt equaled the Cowboys at 15:16.
Dwyer secured the Giants' lead for the first period with his second goal of the night at the end of the first period.
The home team re-established their lead, and Bouchard again equalized with a dominant goal in 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran combined their forces, and Nielsen scored the first lead for Dundee in the bottom of the second inning, and also secured his team's victory with a fifth goal in the middle of the last inning.
The Giants, who have now lost four of their last five games, will next be playing at home in Milton Keynes on Friday.
A flight attendant died while making sure hundreds of passengers escaped the earthquake
In Indonesia, a flight controller has become a hero after he died while making sure that a plane carrying hundreds of passengers safely got off the ground.
More than 800 people have died and many are missing after a powerful earthquake and tsunami struck the island of Sulawesi on Friday.
Strong aftershocks are shaking the area and several people have been trapped in the debris in the town of Palun.
Though his colleagues fled for their lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung did not abandon his work station in the lush air traffic control tower at the Mutiara Sis Al Jufr Airport in Palus.
He stayed in place and made sure that Batik Air Flight 6321 that was on the runway safely got into the air.
Then he jumped out of the control tower, which he thought was about to collapse.
He died later in the hospital.
Air Navigation Indonesia spokesman Yohannes Sirait noted that Agung's decision may have saved hundreds of lives, Australian ABC News reported.
From Balikpapan, Kalimantan, a helicopter was prepared to transport him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he passed away this morning before the helicopter could reach the Pal.
'This news breaks our hearts', he added.
Meanwhile, officials fear the death toll could rise to thousands as the country's disaster authorities have reported that communications with the cities of Donggalan, Siggi and Boutong are failing.
'The death toll is believed to be still rising as many bodies are buried in the rubble and many people have not been reached', said Sutopo Purwo, a spokesman for the agency.
Even waves of six meters have destroyed the village of Pils, where a mass funeral is held on Sunday.
Military and cargo planes are bringing aid and supplies to the area.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old family member, told Sky News: #Ambulance brings in bodies all the time.
There's a shortage of clean water.
There are robberies in mini-markets everywhere.
Jan Gelfand, the Indonesian director of the International Red Cross, said in an interview with CNN: The Indonesian Red Cross is rushing to help survivors, but we don't know what awaits us.
This is a tragedy, but it could turn out to be worse.
Indonesian President Joko Widodo arrived in Palu on Sunday and told the country's armed forces: I ask you all to work day and night to ensure that all evacuation tasks are completed.
Are you ready?
Earlier this year, more than 550 people were killed in earthquakes in Lombok, Indonesia.
Micronesia plane crash: Air Niugini reports one person missing after plane crashes into lagoon
Officials of the airline that crashed into a lagoon in the Pacific Ocean in Micronesia now report that one person is missing, though earlier reports had said that all 47 passengers and crew had been safely evacuated from the sinking plane.
Air Niugini has reported that since Saturday afternoon it has not been able to locate one male passenger.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and accident investigators to locate the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to questions about additional information about the missing passenger, such as age or nationality.
Local boats helped rescue other passengers and crew after the plane hit the water while trying to land at Chuuk Airport.
Authorities announced Friday that seven people had been taken to hospital.
The airline said six people were hospitalized Saturday and all were in stable condition.
The cause of the crash and the exact sequence of events are still unclear.
The airline and the U.S. Navy have both reported that the plane landed in the lagoon before the runway.
Some witnesses thought the plane had gone over the runway.
American passenger Bill Jaynes reported that the plane landed very low.
"That's a very good thing", Jaynes said.
Jaynes says that the passengers were able to crawl out of the sinking plane in waist-deep water to the emergency exits.
He said that the flight crew panicked and shouted, and that he himself suffered a minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy reported that sailors working on a nearby harbor lighthouse assisted in the rescue effort by ferrying people ashore on a rubber boat before the plane sank in about 100 feet of water.
According to the Aviation Safety Network, 111 people have died in accidents involving airlines registered in Papua New Guinea over the past two decades, but Air Niugini has not been involved in accidents.
The analyst is running a timeline to the night the woman was burned alive.
The prosecutor on Saturday helped close a retrial of a man accused of burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.
Paul Rowlett, an analyst with the U.S. Department of Justice, testified for hours as an expert witness in the field of data analytics.
He described to the jury how he had used cell phone records to piece together the movements of the 29-year-old defendant, Quinton Tellis, and the 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, on the night of the victim's death.
Rowlett said he had obtained location data from several cell phones that showed that, contrary to his earlier claims, Tallis was in the company of Chambers on the night of his death, reports The Clarion Ledger.
When the records showed that Tellis' cell phone was with Chambers at the same time Tellis claimed to have been with his friend Michael Sanford, the police questioned Sanford.
Sanford testified Saturday that he was not in town that day.
When asked by the prosecution if Tellis was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford's car that night, Sanford replied that Tellis was "lying because my car was in Nashville".
Another inconsistency was that Tellis claimed to have known Chambers for about two weeks when he died.
According to the cell phone records, they'd only known each other for a week.
Rowlett stated that at some point after Chambers' death, Tellis removed Chambers' text messages, calls, and contact information from his phone.
"He erased her from his life", Hale said.
The closing arguments of the defense are scheduled to begin on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the trial to go to a jury later that day.
The High Breed: What's hip hop supposed to know?
The hip hop trio wants to challenge the negative perceptions associated with the genre by making music that is full of positive messages.
The High Breed, a Bristol-based group, says that hip hop has moved away from its original message of politics and social problems.
They want to go back to the roots of hip hop and make the educational hip hop popular again.
Artists like The Fugees and Common have witnessed the rise of a new Britain with artists like Akala and Lowkey.
Another black guy?
A New York nanny is suing a couple for a racist text message.
A nanny in New York sues a couple for discriminatory divorce after she accidentally receives a text message from the child's mother complaining that she's "just another dark-skinned person".
The couple denies being racists and equates the challenge to "crackdown".
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, expressed her grief when her new nanny, Giselle Maurice, arrived on her first day of work in 2016 and revealed that she was a dark skinned woman.
Last night, right after the fire, Plasco-Flaxman texted her husband.
But then she sent a message to Giselle Maurice instead of her husband, twice.
After realizing her mistake, Plasco-Flaxman, embarrassed, had fired her, according to the New York Post, saying that the previous African-American nanny who had been given a discharge had done a poor job and had waited on the Filipinos.
Maurice was paid for one day's work and sent home in a taxi.
Now Maurice is suing the couple for compensation for the separation and wants $350 a day for six months, which he was originally forced to live and work with the family, albeit without a contract.
"I want to show them that you can't do that", he told the Post on Friday, adding: "I know it's discrimination".
The couple have responded to the racist allegations by saying that terminating Maurice's employment was a justified decision because they could not trust him after hurting him.
My wife sent him something he wasn't supposed to say.
He's not a racist.
"We are not racists", Joel Plasco told The Post.
But would you leave your child in the care of someone to whom you have been unkind, even by mistake?
Your newborn baby?
Really?
Plasco equated the challenge to blackmail, saying that his wife had had a baby two months earlier and was in a "very difficult situation".
Do you really want to chase someone in a situation like this?
It's not very nice, the investment banker added.
While the trial is still ongoing, public opinion has quickly condemned the couple on social media, tapping into their behavior and logic.
A new letter reveals that the Paddington publishers were afraid that the public would identify with the talking bear.
Bond's daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book's approval, says of the letter: "It's hard to imagine someone reading the book for the first time before it was published.
It's funny, now that Paddington's huge popularity is known.
Noting that his father, who had worked as a cameraman for the BBC before devoting himself to writing children's books about the adventures of a teddy bear, would have been optimistic about the rejection of his book, Jankel added that the 60th anniversary of the books' publication felt bitter because his father had died the previous year.
He described Paddington as "a very important member of the family" and said his father was quietly proud of his success.
'He was a rather quiet man, and not a bragging type at all,' she says.
But because Paddington was so real to him, it was almost like a child's achievement to him; something you're proud of, even though it's not really your own accomplishment.
I think he felt that way about Paddington's success.
Even though it was his creation, he always gave credit to Paddington himself.
I had to say goodbye to my dying daughter on the phone.
Her daughter had been rushed to the Louis Pasteur II hospital in Nice after the plane landed, where doctors tried in vain to save her life.
"Nad called every few minutes and said that the situation was so bad that he was not expected to survive", Ednan-Laperouse said.
Then Nad called and said my daughter would be dead in a few minutes and I had to say goodbye on the phone.
So I did.
I said, "I love you so much, honey.
I'll be with you in a minute.
I'm with you.
The medications that doctors used to keep his heart going were gradually being removed from his system.
He was dead a little while ago, and now it's all gone.
I could just sit there knowing that it was all coming to an end.
I couldn't scream or cry because I was in a situation where I was surrounded by families and other people.
I had to keep myself together.
Finally, Ednan-Laperouse, mourning the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane with other passengers - who knew nothing of the ordeal she was going through.
"No one knew", he said.
I kept my head down and tears were flowing all the time.
It's hard to explain, but during the flight, I felt a great deal of compassion for Nadia.
That he needed my love and understanding right now.
I knew how much he loved my daughter.
Grief women send cards to prevent suicides on the bridge
Two women who lost loved ones are working to stop other people from committing suicide.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys send cards with encouraging messages and a phone number to reach for support.
Davis' son Tyler suffered from depression at the age of 13 and committed suicide at the age of 18.
'I would not want any parent to have to experience the feelings I feel every day,' she said.
Davis, 45, of Lydney, says that her son was a promising chef with an infectious smile.
He was known for his smile.
Everyone said her smile lights up the room.
However, he stopped working before his death because he felt he was in the "darkness".
In 2014, Tyler's 11-year-old brother found his brother dead.
Davis says he's always worried about the aftermath.
Davis created the cards to let people know that there are people you can go to and talk to, even if it's a friend.
Don't be silent - you have to talk.
Humphreys has been a friend of Davies' for several years, and lost his partner Mark after 15 years together shortly after his mother died.
"He didn't tell me he was depressed or depressed or anything like that", Humphreys said.
A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his behavior.
He was all over the place on Christmas Eve, and when the kids opened their presents, he didn't make eye contact or anything like that.
He says that Mark's death was a severe trauma for them, but they have to move on: It's breaking up the family.
It's tearing us apart.
But we just have to keep living and keep fighting.

Brett Kavanaugh's future is at stake as the FBI begins its investigation.
'I thought that if we could really achieve what he wanted - a limited in time and scope investigation - we might be able to achieve some unity,' Flake said on Saturday, adding that he feared the committee would 'break down' the impasse caused by supporters.
Why didn't Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate?
Reluctance is about timing.
The midterm elections are only five weeks away, November 6th, and if the Republican success rate is as low as expected, their quest to get their man elected to the nation's highest court will be made more difficult.
George W. Bush has been on the phone lobbying senators to support Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House during Bush and through him met his wife, Ashley, who was President Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI has compiled the report?
The Senate, which currently has 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats, will now vote on the bill.
It's still unclear if Kavanaugh can get at least 50 votes, which would allow Vice President Mike Pence to blow the whistle and confirm his selection to the Supreme Court.
North Korean defector numbers drop under Kim
According to a South Korean lawmaker, the number of North Korean defectors to South Korea has decreased since Kim Jong-un's seizure of power seven years ago.
Park Byeong-seug quoted the South Korean Ministry of Unification as saying that 1,127 defections occurred last year, and 2,706 in 2011.
The Commission has also published a report on the implementation of the EU's new rules on the protection of the environment.
Pyongyang has not commented publicly on the matter.
Most of the North Korean defectors are eventually offered South Korean citizenship.
According to the report, more than 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border since the Korean War ended in 1953.
Most of them are fleeing through China, because it has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the heavily protected demilitarized zone between the Koreas.
China treats defectors as illegal immigrants, not refugees, and most often forcibly returns them.
Again, technically speaking, relations between North Korea and South Korea, which are at war, have improved significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month, world leaders met in Pyongyang and focused on stalled negotiations on nuclear disarmament.
This followed the historic June summit where US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un met in Singapore and agreed at the general level to work towards denuclearisation of the Korean Peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed the United States for sticking to sanctions after the meeting.
'Without any confidence from the US side, our national security is not on a solid foundation and under no circumstances will we unilaterally disarm first,' Ri said in his address to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and "unfit to serve on the Supreme Court".
House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi called Supreme Court Justice-elect Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and said he was temporarily unfit to serve on the Supreme Court.
The comments were made by Pelosi in an interview Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I couldn't help but think that if she had behaved like that, she would have been called 'hysterical,'" Pelosi said in her own reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh has strongly denied allegations that he sexually assaulted Christine Blasey Ford when they were teenagers.
During his opening remarks, Kavanaugh was overwhelmed with emotion and at times almost screamed and lost his speech as he spoke about his family and his high school years.
He also strongly condemned the Democratic members of the committee for calling the charges against him "grotesque and a planned persecution of a person" by liberals angry with Hillary Clinton's loss in the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said he believed Kavanaugh's testimony showed he was unfit to serve on the Supreme Court because it showed he was biased against Democrats.
"I believe he made himself incompetent with his statements and the way he attacked the Clintons and the Democrats", Pelosi said.
Pelosi wondered, when asked if he would impeach Kavanaugh if his election was confirmed and if the Democrats won a majority in the House of Representatives.
"Let's put it this way, if he doesn't tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, he's not only ineligible for the Supreme Court, but also for the court where he currently works", Pelosi replied.
Kavanaugh currently serves on the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit.
Adding to his fear, as a Democrat, he was concerned about Kavanaugh's possible orders on health care reform or the Roe v. Wade case, as Kavanaugh is known to be a conservative prosecutor.
In the confirmation hearings, Kavanaugh avoided questions about whether he would overturn certain Supreme Court decisions.
'It is not the right time for a hysterical and biased person to be elected to the Court and we are expected to say that it is great,' said Pelosi.
Women have to get through everything .
It is a legitimate fire speech, with months and years of rage raging over it, and he cannot hold it without crying.
"We cry when we're angry", Ms. Steinem told me 45 years later.
I don't think it's unusual in any way, do you?
She continued: "I was greatly helped by a woman who was in a position of leadership somewhere and who told me that she also cried when she got angry, but that she had developed a habit of saying to her interlocutor when she got angry and started crying: 'You may think I'm sad now because I'm crying.
I'm really mad.
And then he just kept going.
And I thought it was brilliant.
Tears are justified as a means of fury, though they are generally misunderstood as a fundamental form of anger.
One of my most memorable recollections of my early work in a male-dominated office is when I once wept with unspoken rage and an older woman - a cold-faced supervisor whom I had always been a little afraid of - grabbed me by the neck and dragged me down the stairs.
"Never let them see you cry", he said.
They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sad, and then they're happy because they've made you feel bad.
Patricia Schroeder, then a Democratic congresswoman from Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart on his presidential campaign.
When Hart was caught having an affair on the Monkey Business in 1987 and was forced out of the race, Schroeder, in great frustration, decided there was no reason why he shouldn't run for president himself.
"It was not a very well-considered decision", he told me laughingly 30 years later.
 There were already seven candidates and the least we needed was one more.
Someone called the situation "Snow and the Seven Dwarfs".
With the campaign running late, he was behind in his fundraising efforts, and he announced that he would not run unless he could raise two million dollars.
It was a lost battle.
She found that some of her supporters, who had given her a thousand dollars for the male candidates, had given her only 250.
"Do they think I'll get a discount?" he wondered.
When she gave her speech and announced that she would not be officially launching her campaign, she was overwhelmed by her emotions - gratitude for her supporters, frustration with the system that made it so difficult to raise funds for voters and not for the delegates, and hatred for sexism - that she couldn't speak.
"You might have thought I was having a nervous breakdown", Schroeder recalls the press reactions.
You might have thought that Kleenex was my sponsor.
I remember thinking that my tombstone would be beaten into a memorial inscription.
He cried.
How the U.S. trade war with China could benefit Beijing
The launch of the US-China trade war was a deafening blow, and while the fight is far from over, the rift between the two countries could benefit Beijing in the long run, experts say.
US President Donald Trump issued his first warning earlier this year by imposing import duties on China's main exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most significant escalation occurred this week with new tariffs affecting $200 billion (£150 billion) of imported goods, effectively taxing half of all products imported from China into the United States.
Beijing has retaliated each time with the same measure, most recently imposing tariffs of between 5 and 10 percent on $60 billion worth of American imports.
China has promised to retaliate to the United States in a tit-for-tat fashion, and there is no sign that the world's second largest economy is about to recover for a moment.
To get Washington to back down, they would have to give in to their own demands, but publicly bowing to the United States would be far too humiliating for Chinese President Xi Jinping.
However, experts point out that if Beijing plays its cards right, the US trade war can have a positive impact on China in the long run by reducing interdependence.
"A quick political decision in either Washington or Beijing could create the conditions that initiate a downturn in either country, and this is actually a more dangerous possibility than even the onlooker has realized", says Abigail Grace, a research assistant in the Center for New American Security think tank.
Syrian Foreign Minister says country 'ready' for return of refugees
Syria says it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and is asking for help in rebuilding the country after more than seven years of devastating war.
In his speech to the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said that conditions in the country were improving.
'The situation is now more stable and safer thanks to the developments in the fight against terrorism', he said.
The government continues to repair the areas destroyed by terrorists to restore normalcy.
The conditions now allow for the voluntary return of refugees to the country from which they were forced to leave by terrorism and unilateral economic measures targeting their daily lives and livelihoods.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
In addition, there are still six million people in need of humanitarian aid.
The EU is also calling for the release of all political prisoners and the release of all political prisoners.
He stressed, however, that the government would not accept conditional aid or assistance from states that supported the rebels.
European team confirms Ryder Cup win in Paris
The European team has won the 2018 Ryder Cup by beating the US team by a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National outside Paris in France.
The United States has now lost six straight European Ryder Cups and has not won a European Ryder Cup since 1993.
The European team kept the crown for themselves when its Danish captain, Thomas Bjørn, scored the 14.5 points needed to beat the United States.
American star Phil Mickelson was struggling for almost the entire tournament, and he hit his opening shot into the water on the par-3 16th hole, giving the match to Francesco Molinar.
Italy's Molinari was brilliant in all rounds, becoming one of only four players to have a 5-0-0 record since the tournament began in its current form in 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth was eliminated with a score of 5-4 against the lowest ranked player in the European team, Thorbjørn Olesen of Denmark.
The world's top-ranked player, Dustin Johnson, lost 2 to 1 to England's Ian Poulter, who was now in his final Ryder Cup.
Eight-time Ryder Cup golf veteran Sergio Garcia of Spain became the tournament's all-time winningest European with a career-best 25.5 points.
I don't normally cry, but today I can't help it.
It's been a tough year.
I'm so grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm so happy to get this win.
It's about the team and I'm glad I could help", said Garcia, who was moved by the European team's victory.
He's passing the torch to his compatriot, Jon Rahm, who beat American golf legend Tiger Woods in the 2&1 Sunday individual competition.
"I feel a tremendous sense of pride in beating Tiger Woods, and I grew up admiring him", said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all four of his matches in France and now holds a Ryder Cup record of 13-21-3.
Odd statistics from one of the greatest players of all time, who has won 14 major championships and is second only to Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team struggled to find their way through the entire weekend, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finauta, who played at a high level throughout the tournament.
Team USA captain Jim Furyk said after his team's failed performance, "I'm proud of these guys, they fought.
We were the underdog team in Europe this morning.
We were in a fight.
- Thank you.
He's a great captain.
All 12 of his players played very well.
We regroup, I work with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup committee, and we move on.
These 12 guys are amazing, and I'm proud to be their captain.
I gotta take my hat off to you.
We have met our winner.
Red tide algae price situation: concentrations are decreasing in Pinellas, Manate and Sarasota
The Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission's latest report shows a general decline in algae numbers in the Tampa Bay area.
According to the FWC, more dispersed areas of algae are reported from areas of Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier counties, indicating a possible decrease in concentrations.
The Red Tide Swamp stretches along the coast for about 130 miles from Pinellas to southern Lee County.
There are reports of rafts up to ten miles off the coast of Hillsborough County, but they're less common than last week.
Red tide trout have also been spotted in Pasco County.
Moderate concentrations were reported from the coast of Pinellas County during the past week, ranging from low to high concentrations in the coast of Hillsborough County, from low to high concentrations in Manatee and Sarasota counties, from low to moderate concentrations in Charlotte County, and from low to high concentrations in the coast of Lee County and Collier County.
Respiratory symptoms are still being reported in the areas of Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Lee and Collier.
In the last week, there were no reports of respiratory distress in northwest Florida.
