Number of Ukrainian recruits preparing to be sent to Donbass
The official representative of the People’s Militia of the self-proclaimed Luhansk People’s Republic (LPR) Andrei Marocko said that in the winter of 2018-2019 Ukraine will send to Donbass at least 3 thousand recruits.
According to him, in this way, Kiev plans "at least somehow to supplement the units".
“The unwillingness of Ukrainian citizens to serve in the ranks of the Ukrainian Armed Forces, mass dismissals have led to low units,” Marocko told RIA Novosti.
He also noted that the real numbers of Ukrainians called in the army could be increased if necessary.
In 2014-2017, Kiev launched the so-called anti-terrorist operation (ATO), which was later replaced by Operation Joint Forces (OAS).
It was assumed that this measure would strengthen the role of Ukrainian security forces in the settlement of the situation.
At the end of August 2018, the situation in the Donbass worsened due to the murder of the head of the DPR Alexander Zakharchenko.
The DPR authorities qualified the incident as a terrorist attack.
During the investigation of the criminal case several people involved in the explosion were detained.
According to preliminary data, they confirmed that the sabotage was organized by Ukrainian special services.

To settle claims of the Federal Securities and Exchange Commission, the entrepreneur will also pay $20 million.

British Foreign Minister compares EU to Soviet Union and prison
British Foreign Minister Jeremy Hunt compared the European Union to the Soviet Union and accused Brussels of capturing member states.
The statement was made at the Congress of the ruling Conservative Party in Birmingham, which opened on Sunday, September 30.
As the Daily Mail notes, Hunt commented on the difficulties in the Brexit negotiation process.
What happened to the belief in the European dream and its ideals?
The EU was created to defend freedom, and the Soviet Union did not let anyone leave it.
"The lesson of history is obvious: if you turn the EU from a community to a prison, the desire to leave it will not decrease, but will only grow, and we will not be the only prisoner who will want to escape from captivity," he said.
He also added that attempts to punish Britain for the decision to leave the European Union will only aggravate the crisis.
In mid-September, British Prime Minister Theresa May said Brexit negotiations had come to an impasse.
This was stated at the informal EU summit in Salzburg.
The decision on Brexit was made in 2016 by a referendum.
The UK’s withdrawal is expected to take place by April 2019, but negotiations with Brussels on this issue are complicated by a number of factors.
In particular, there is still no clear agreement on how the parties will interact after London leaves the community.
The issue of the Irish border remains open.

Telegram users complain about a failure in the new version
iPhone users have complained about problems in the Telegram messenger after the update, released on September 28.
The user’s phone number can be identified by his username.
The complaints concern gadgets with the current operating system iOS 12.
According to their owners, after the update, the app displays a white screen or immediately closes.
Messengers reacted to the failure.
According to them, the problem may be related to the migration of information to a new app written in the Swift language.
Telegram has temporarily suspended the automatic update of the app until the trouble is resolved.
On April 13, the Tagansky court of Moscow satisfied Roskomnadzor’s claim for blocking Telegram in Russia.
Three days later, the telecommunications operators began to execute the decision.
The reason was that the messenger administration refused to provide the FSB with the keys to decrypt the correspondence needed to obtain data about terrorists.
In August, Telegram changed its privacy policy and agreed to disclose the IP address and mobile phone number of the suspected terrorist user upon receipt of a relevant court ruling.
Telegram audience after blocking in Russia decreased by 1.2 million

The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and Tesla founder Elon Musk have settled their dispute over fraud.
This is by CNBC News.
According to the TV channel, within the framework of the agreements reached, Musk will have to leave the post of chairman of the board of directors of Tesla.

The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has filed a lawsuit against Tesla CEO Elon Musk over his tweet about the company’s possible ransom.
Last month, Musk announced plans to make Tesla a private company and buy back all shares on the stock exchange at a fixed price of $420.
The price of the $420 share was established allegedly "due to the significance of this number in the culture of marijuana," Bloomberg earlier with reference to the co-director of the security department of the commission Steven Pekin.
At the same time, Elon Musk subsequently abandoned his plans to buy out shares.
Commenting on the lawsuit filed against him by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, the businessman said he considered the allegations of fraud unfounded, and added that he was very disappointed and saddened by these claims.
"Honesty is the most important value in my life, and the facts will prove that I have not violated it in any way," the businessman told CNBC.

I know that in Russia there are fans of automobile sports, wealthy businessmen who are ready to invest, ready to invest in the creation of the Russian Formula 1 team.

Hopefully we will have such a team.
I suspect that the idea of creating a team appeared, including because such an infrastructure appeared in Sochi.”
Tomorrow the Sochi Autodrome awaits an anshlag.

Trump talks about his “love” with Kim Jong-un
From mutual cruelty, the leaders of the United States and the DPRK have almost come to fall in love with each other, Donald Trump joked.
U.S. President Donald Trump noted a successful joke about his successes on the front of settling the North Korean crisis.
Starting with mutual threats of destruction, the leaders of the two countries have now so corrected their relations that they are barely in love with each other, the US president noted.
The head of the White House recalled that he accepted from the previous administration the North Korean problem as the main complexity in foreign policy.
Trump noted that the team of Barack Obama has launched relations with the DPRK so much that it could not even call the leadership of the country - there simply did not remove the tube.
At that time, the United States and North Korea were on the verge of war, and today the North Korean leader is writing “beautiful letters” to the White House, Trump said.
Trump admitted that at the beginning of his work he was also “cruel” to Kim Jong-un, which, however, was mutual.
However, now their relationship has improved to the point that the leaders have "falled in love with each other."
At the same time, Trump asked not to take his words literally and warned that the US media would interpret them as incompetence.
Trump noted that Pyongyang has recently halted its nuclear and missile tests and closed its military sites.
All this is the merit of his administration’s work, the American president is confident.
Last Tuesday, Donald Trump graciously spoke about Kim Jong-un from the United Nations General Assembly.
Trump thanked the North Korean leader for the courage and steps taken to de-escalate tensions.
At the same time, Trump noted that the sanctions against the DPRK will remain until the complete denuclearization of the Korean peninsula.

Nice urged to replace "Moscow language with Ukrainian product"
Ukrainian children’s writer and fighter for the purity of the mother tongue Larisa Nice called for the suppression of “Russian-speaking Moscow product and Moscow language” from Ukraine.
She proposes to do so with the Ukrainian product – “cultural wave, cultural pressure.”
She shared her considerations about "the feasibility of eradicating the Russian language in Ukraine" with the Ukrainian publication "Obzorzavatel".
According to her, the corresponding Ukrainian product is now being prepared – it even already exists and continues to develop further.
Over time, Ukrainians will “recover” from this “Moscow language,” she is convinced.
For example, in neighboring Poland, she said, Russian was widely used on television and radio, but in the public space it has virtually not remained.
At the same time, according to Nice, the Ukrainians do not use aggressive methods in this process: the actions of the authorities prohibiting the use of the Russian language, in her opinion, are only "expanding the borders for Ukrainian speech at the legislative level".
Nice previously shared her experience ofining the “Ukrainian-language regime” in a children’s camp in the Carpathians, where she was invited to work.
In December 2016, she threatened the court of the Watsons bookstore network, the treasurer of one of which communicated with her in Russian.
Without achieving his, Nizza threw a surrender into the girl.
She calls the use of Russian words by Ukrainians "language schizophrenia", urging Ukrainians to abandon Russian letters even in the writing of surnames.
Recently, Nice stated that the name "Russia" was stolen from the Ukrainians, so Russia should be called Moscow.
The Writer’s anger was not even avoided by the Ukrainian Security Service: having come there and heard the conversations of employees with each other in Russian, she made a scandal and left, knocking the door.
During the interruption, a man's conversation was held, and it brought its fruits.
Defender of "Ural" Denis Kulakov - about victory over "Arsenal" (2:1) in the match of the ninth round of the championship of Russia.
“Dennis, what do you think you’ve won?”
"I think we wanted to win more," Kulakov said on the official Ural website.
Such a difficult game worked out, in the pause had a serious male conversation, and it brought its fruits: they scored two balls and did not miss.
"You missed several matches because of the injury you received at the beginning of the month.
How did you feel today?”
If it lasts for 90 minutes, it’s okay.
In fact, I felt good.
Maybe at the end a little bit of strength so that nothing happens.
So, the physiotherapist and physiotherapist Vladimir Anatolyevich Hashnev brought me to this game, for which they are very grateful!
What about the atmosphere in the team?
"It is no secret that after wins and recovering is easier, and the mood in the team is good.
Now we have a white strip, although at first it was black.
We need to continue in the same spirit and delight the fans.”
“Did you miss the game for the time you didn’t go out on the field?”
"There is such a little missed, because really, an unpleasant situation came out.
But once again, thank the physiotherapist and doctors for putting them on their feet.
Most importantly, we won and delighted the fans.
The rest is secondary.”

The referendum is aimed at resolving a 27-year dispute between Macedonia and Greece over the name of the former Yugoslav republic, which coincides with the name of the northern Greek region.

Vucic said he did not want to allow a scenario in which some major military clashes could occur in the country.
The president of the country promised to make the most efforts to preserve peace, the newspaper reports.
According to the information of Serbian media, the meeting of the heads of Russia and Serbia is scheduled for the upcoming Tuesday, October 2, writes "Lenta.ru".
A day earlier it became known that the Serbian president brought the army of the state into full combat readiness due to the situation with Kosovo.
We are talking about the events of last Friday, when several dozen Kosovo special forces entered the territory adjacent to the lake that supplies water to the hydroelectric power plant Gazivode.
It is specified that this hydroelectric power plant is located on the territory of Kosovo, but it belongs to the Serbian energy system.
Kosovo declared independence from Serbia a decade ago, but Belgrade refused to recognize it.
The two sides stopped negotiations on the matter last year.

Kosachev: At the 73rd session of the UN General Assembly the topic of Russia in a negative key was practically absent
The head of the Federation Council Committee on International Affairs Konstantin Kosachev considers the 73rd session of the UN General Assembly successful for Russia and does not rule out that it can become a turning point in the perception of Russia as an integral participant in solving global world problems.
"The uniqueness of this 73rd session, in my opinion, lies in the fact that the rhetoric, to which we have almost become accustomed in recent years with regard to Russia, has now been somewhat more silenced," the senator said in an interview published on Sunday by the Russian newspaper.
He explained that in the previous years Russia was sometimes "designated as one of the three main threats to humanity, then along with Ebola fever, then along with climate change or terrorism, Russia was in this row, in any case, in the presentation of a group of Western countries, which on this matter was spoken quite unanimously".
At the 73rd session, Kosachev stressed, "the topic of Russia in the negative key was virtually absent."
"If you carefully analyze the speech of the President of the United States, the President of France, the speech of the Foreign Minister of Germany, I do not now take Ukraine, Georgia, or the British, in any case, the choir was not quite accurate," the politician paid attention, noting that Russia "was no longer a wall that is being trained with a tennis ball."
The head of the profile committee of the Federation Council does not rule out that this indicates a certain trend that, in his opinion, "will highlight the current session [of the UN General Assembly], although to the full extent this trend may be manifested in a year, two, three."
"I do not rule out that the current session in some sense may be turning point," Kosachev said, explaining that "too many examples of how with the connection of Russia it is possible to move forward in international affairs."
As an example, he cited the situation in Syria, around Iran and North Korea.
"So far, unfortunately, this is not Ukraine, but I have no doubt that the Russian vision of the Ukrainian crisis will also be in demand over time," he said.
This is due to the fact, he believes, that there is an “adequate, healthy perception of Russia as not just a possible – an integral participant in solving global problems of modern times.”
"I don't want to make a mistake, but I have the feeling that we are going somewhere to a point where movement will no longer be a move backwards, it will be a move forward," he added.
Another "interesting and important feeling" in this context Kosachev called the "request for the Russian vision of how the modern world should develop."
“I attended very many meetings of the head of the Russian delegation [at the session of the General Assembly] of the Minister of Foreign Affairs Sergei Lavrov, I held my own meetings, and I was very pleased to see that if a year or two or five years ago, Russian opinion, Russian vision of what is happening in the world, in large, nobody was interested, then now the situation is different,” – said the Chairman of the Committee of the Soviet Federation.
In his opinion, this is due to the fact that "the so-called new liberal order, which is embodied with the West, has no answers to the questions of how to solve world problems due to the obvious shortage of ideas in the global space, the shortage of ideas on how to solve the problems of the Middle East, the problem of terrorism, the problem of non-proliferation of nuclear weapons, the problem of migration."
"And here the request for the Russian vision is becoming more and more obvious," Kosachev expressed confidence, stressing that he considers in this sense that "this session is successful for the work of the Russian delegation, successful for Russia."

Damascus declared its right to use military force in Idlib
Damascus hopes that it will not have to use military force in the Syrian province of Idlib, said Foreign Minister of the Syrian Arab Republic Valid Muallem.

The Minister added that Turkey has the opportunity to quickly solve the problem of withdrawal of the militants of the banned in Russia organization Jebhat al-Nusra from the demilitarized zone in Idlib, reports "RIA Novosti".
He also stressed that Damascus will have to resort to a military solution to the problem of territories east of the Euphrates in case of Kurdish aspirations for separatism.
At the same time, according to Muallem, the talks with the Kurdish forces of the SDF were good until they were interrupted because of the United States.
On September 17, Putin and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan agreed to create by October 15 a demilitarized zone along the line of contact between the armed opposition and government troops in the Syrian province of Idlib.

The disease, unfortunately, does not spare anyone, and the stories of popular people about victories over cancer give hope to many patients.
The famous actor Wachtang Kikabidze admitted that he lived only thanks to his wife.

Gennady Onishchenko, Deputy of the State Duma of the Russian Federation (in an interview with the radio station "Moscow Speaks":

According to Onishchenko, the solution of the problem is hindered by the "hanseness", the silence of the "sexual age problems" and the lack of a culture of adequate upbringing of children.
The doctor is confident that many teenagers face onanism.
The Deputy believes that to practice lessons about the harm of onanism first and foremost in the schools of "hyperurbanized" regions.

ADH became the second most popular in Germany
The anti-immigrant "Alternative for Germany" is breaking another popularity record, and the ratings of Angela Merkel are falling.
It seems that German residents are seriously tired of Angela Merkel’s immigration policy, which has made the country a coveted target for millions of refugees from the Middle East.
Most clearly, this is stated by recent polls, according to which the anti-immigrant party "Alternative for Germany" is becoming more and more popular, and the positions of the ruling bloc of Merkel and Seehofer are weakening.
This week, ADG broke another record, rising to the second place in the popular sympathy ranking.
The right-wing Conservatives with 17 percent of popularity managed to bypass the Social Democrats, who have about 16 percent.
The gap of one percentage point can be attributed to a statistical error, but it cannot be ignored that the fact that the AdG created in 2013 from a small group of eurosceptic economists has managed to turn into a serious political force.
The leadership in the overall record for now continues to hold the ruling bloc of the CSU/CDU, which has about 30 percent.
However, there is a tendency to lose points here - even in April, the support of the bloc of Angela Merkel was four percentage points higher.
The personal rating of the German Chancellor, who is head of the German government for the fourth consecutive term, is also falling.
Today, 48 percent of Germans support Angela Merkel, which is 7 percent lower than last year.
Following the Social Democrats are the Greens (15%), the Left (11%) and the Liberals (10%).
The evolution of “alternatives”
The Alternative for Germany party was formed in September 2012 on the basis of the Alternative Choice 2013 group, which included members of the Christian Democratic Union.
The group initially opposed the government’s course, but initially dealt only with economic issues, including the problems of the euro and cooperation within the EU.
At the same time, the group opposed Germany's "sponsoring" of weak EU economies, did not rule out the possibility of a return to the German mark and a full exit of the country from the European Union.
With the deepening of the immigration crisis, the ADG political platform has expanded.
In 2013, the group formed into a full-fledged party that occupied a niche of eurosceptics and began to harshly criticize the government for the failure of immigration policy.
At the last parliamentary elections in 2017, the AdH managed to break into the Bundestag for the first time, receiving 94 seats (from 709).
Two representatives of Alternative for Germany have won seats in the European Parliament.
Published video with a journalist who called citizens of Ukraine "nation of bolvans"
Leading a political talk-show on Ukrainian TV, the author of two books Ostap Drozdov in direct broadcast admitted that he considers his compatriots "the nation of bolvans".
They believe in television and read little.
As Drzodov noted, it is difficult to live and work in such a country.
"We have not been vaccinated with a culture of reading and acceptance of texts since childhood," the journalist said.
Local nationalists immediately criticized Drozdov’s words, accusing him of lack of patriotism and greed.
As previously, the State Committee on Television and Radio Broadcasting of the Independent began to fight with literature, which has the slightest hint of criticism of the Kiev authorities, banning the import of up to 201 edition.

Canadians created a car for the event of the apocalypse - magazine
Anyone can buy this car.
Roshel Defence Solutions has said it is already accepting orders for its new armor.
Roshel Senator APC Apocalypse Armour
On the topic of apocalypse, money is made not only by video game producers, film studios and book publishers.
Now the new niche is being mastered by the automotive companies.
For example, Canadian Roshel Defence Solutions presented its Apocalypse armor Senator APC.
In a time free from fantasy, the engineers of this company create armored cars for the police.
The Roshel Senator APC is designed for 12 passengers, who without special comfort, but in complete safety are placed in a fully welded armored capsule.
This bunker, otherwise the design will not be named, as the level of its reservation meets the standard B7, installed on the chassis of the powerful Ford Super Duty pickup.
Its bottom, also armored, is able to protect the capsule from explosions by grenades and anti-infanteric mines.
Roshel Senator APC Apocalypse Armour
In order for passengers not to be hurt even by the explosive wave from the projectile that broke near the car, the car’s cabin is equipped with special amortizing seats.
In addition, the capsule has an autonomous ventilation and fire extinguishing system.
For safe viewing, the Roshel Senator APC is equipped with a circular viewing camera system with night vision function, as well as a viewing armored tower on the roof.
There are no weapons in the car.

To prevent the weight of the armored vehicle from affecting its mobility, the Roshel Senator APC is equipped with a 330-powered durable 6.7-litre turbodiesel engine, whose entire power is transferred to the four wheels of the armor via a 6-speed automatic transmission.
There is no chance of getting stuck in the apocalypse armor Roshel Senator APC
The Roshel Senator APC can be seen at a specialized exhibition in Washington, D.C., which will take place in October.
The deadline of the universe
The universe will be around 140 billion years old, which is ten times the age of the observed world, which is about 13.8 billion years old.
The study of the international team of scientists is placed in the library of electronic preprints arXiv.org and sent for publication in the journal Publications of the Astronomical Society of Japan, reports the Japanese newspaper Asahi Shimbun.
The scientists came to this conclusion by using the Subaru Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) camera to observe about ten million galaxies.
Following the distribution of dark matter and dark energy, which account for more than 95 percent of the mass energy of the observed world, the scientists, working as part of the standard cosmological model ΛCDM (Λ Cold Dark Matter), estimated the rate of expansion of the universe, which was slightly slower than previously thought.
Subaru’s press release notes that the observations have provided a detailed three-dimensional map of the distribution of matter in the universe, and the data recording of the European space telescope Planck has clarified the limitations imposed on the ΛCDM parameters.
In July, scientists simulated the possible death of the universe.
Three years earlier, their colleagues presented new arguments that the observed world would cease to exist in 22 billion years as a result of the Great Gap.
Another attempt to unite the initiators of the pension referendum failed
Opportunity to know the opinion of the people about pension reform is postponed indefinitely
In Moscow on Saturday was held a meeting of the all-federal initiative group of the referendum against raising the retirement age.
It was attended by representatives of 13 subgroups, which registered different formulations of questions (in total, the Central Election Committee registered five formulations).
They decided to apply to the Central Committee with a petition for the registration of a single initiative group and ask the Russians the question: "Are you in favor of not raising the age established by the legislation on pension provision as of July 1, 2018, at which the citizens of Russia are entitled to the appointment of old-age pension?"
This formulation was registered by the Volgograd subgroup, whose representatives did not participate in the assembly, but it was considered the simplest and legally feasible.
The majority of the participants of the meeting were supporters of the member of "Just Russia" Ilya Sviridov (six subgroups) and the KPRF (four subgroups).
Three independent subgroups joined them - from Nizhny Novgorod, Voronezh and Orenburg.
Sviridov told Vedomosti that the invitations were sent to all the initiators, and representatives of about 40 subgroups expressed their consent to come.
But, for example, Marina Semenova, who heads the Volgograd subgroup (her formulation was supported by another 15 subgroups), told Vedomosti that she did not receive the invitation and did not plan to come: "We did not understand who is a friend and who is an enemy."

In the match "Loco" - "Ahmat" Turbin mistakes broke out, like a horn of abundance
The former judge of the All-Union category Vladimir Levitin commented on the work of the referee Yevgeny Turbin in the match of the 9th round of the championship of Russia "Lokomotiv" - "Ahmat" and dismantled the controversial episodes of the game.
- How do you assess the judge of Evgeny Turbin in the match "Lokomotiv" - "Ahmat"?
“I believe that this referee has confirmed his inappropriacy to judge matches of the Russian Premier League.
I am surprised that the pressure in the meeting of the fifth round "Spartak" - "Dinamo", neither Turbin himself nor the leaders of the DSI made serious conclusions about his low qualification.
The result did not slow to affect in the ninth round: mistakes in his actions, private misses of rough techniques came out of the horn of abundance.
For example, in the 50th minute of the railroad, Eder is crashed with the help of his hands in his penalty square defender "Ahmata" Rodolfo.
Eight meters from the gate, but Turbin does not put a penalty.
- How do you assess the episode with the participation of Idov, who was in the 82nd minute, when it seemed that the ball fell into his hand?
I think there was a deliberate defense hand in his penalty square.
The turbine was close to the moment, well seeing this episode and his first assistant on the right.
This was to be seen by the reserve judge Sergey Karasev.
Nevertheless, all three fell asleep, and no penalty was awarded.
Therefore, the score in the match was distorted, and sports fairness was damaged.
It was the same case when the judge of concepts displaced and buried the sporting spirit of the game.
At the 52nd minute, Turbin did not dare to remove the guest defender Oleg Ivanov, who violated the rules in the fight against Krychovyak, and when the judge showed him a yellow card, demonstrately applauded him.
What do you think of this episode?
Did you have to show a second "sandwich"?
At this point, Turbin and the first yellow card showed not quite the case.
The second would be illogical.
- Oleg Ivanov said after the match about double standards of judgment that some teams are punished for such violations as in the episode with Idova, and some do not.
What do you think of the footballer’s words?
It depends on what we understand by double standards.
There was penalty.
did not give him.
Thus, the referee does not give a second penalty in the opposite gate.
This is the principle used.
The second point of the double standards is that the referee is watching who plays.
Locomotive played on Saturday and Akhmat has serious claims to Turbin’s work because the team was compromised.
Matt Damon played rape accused Kavanaugh Judge at SNL start
American actor Matt Damon played U.S. Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh, who is accused of rape.
Damon appeared in the first issue of the new season of Saturday Night Live on NBC.
During a small sketch, the actor played Kavanaugh at hearings in the Senate on charges of rape.
The U.S. Supreme Court candidate previously attracted attention with his emotionality and detailed stories during a conversation with Senator Amy Klobushar.
For example, Kavano repeatedly confessed to his love of beer, but stated that he was never drunk to memory.
Furthermore, in an attempt to justify himself on rape charges, Kavano claimed that in those years he was a virgin.
Damon also defeated those moments.
I just did that I drank a lot and didn’t think about sex at all.
I was the most proud, most drunken virgin anyone has ever seen.
Everyone knows this,” said the judge performed by Matt Damon.
Kavanaugh has been elected the Supreme Court of the United States.
Barbra Streisand has discovered strange behavior in her cloned dogs
American singer Barbara Streisand has said that the clones of her dead dog behave completely differently than the original pet.
“They are not similar.
In fact, [clones] look like her, but it is impossible to clone the soul," the 76-year-old singer said.
At the end of 2017, Streisand ordered two clones of her 14-year-old cat-de-tullear breed named Samantha, who had to fall asleep due to health problems.
In July 2018, it was that the dog of the breed Chihuahua named Miracle Milly, who was named the smallest dog in the world, was cloned for the 49th time.
Experts are cloning a six-year-old animal in an attempt to understand why it is so miniature.
The United States considered a maritime blockade of Russia due to oil and gas supplies
The U.S. could launch a maritime blockade of Russia to gain an advantage in the global energy market.
The U.S. authorities are so fiercely engaged in the struggle for success in the global hydrocarbon market that they are ready to resort to the maritime blockade of Russia, which remains one of the world’s main energy suppliers.
About the possibility of a maritime blockade told the head of the U.S. Interior Department Ryan Zinke.
Contrary to international practice, the U.S. Department of Internal Affairs does not perform police, but civil functions, including the implementation of natural resources policy.
Therefore, Zinke’s statement came within the competence of the department he headed, although it was not deprived of political colour.
Speaking at an industrial event in Pittsburgh, Zinke said that thanks to the Navy, the U.S. controls maritime routes in the Middle East region and can block them if necessary.
According to Zinke, the need may be linked to Washington’s desire to hinder Russian supplies to the global energy market.
Zinke recalled that Russia still receives the lion’s share of its revenues from supplies to the world market of oil and gas.
The desire to distribute energy supplies in the Middle East as well as in Eastern Europe was the main motive for Moscow’s activation in this region, Zinke said.
The minister made it clear that the United States still expects to secure its leadership in the global energy market, becoming the largest supplier of oil and gas.
To do this, Washington will have to squeeze Russia and Iran, and the maritime blockade of trade routes is an acceptable measure on this path, Zinke believes.

Formula 1 Grand Prix of Russia
There is a club in Russia that I follow.
Former captain of "Chelsea" and England national team John Terry - about why attended the match of the ninth round of the championship of Russia "Spartak" - "Rostov" (0:1).
"I have a club in Russia that I follow.
I watched it recently and was interested to look at it from the side.
I can’t say that I’m a fan, because my heart belongs to Chelsea, but I have sympathy for Spartacus and once again want to apologize for the decision,” Terry said.
Recall, "Rostov" with 18 points rose to the third place in the tournament table, and "Spartak" placed on the fifth line, having 15 points in the asset.
In the next round, the red-and-white on October 7 will play with "Enisee", and Valery Karpin's caregivers will take "Orenburg" a day earlier.
The violin was handed over to a lombard for a price
When a man brought a violin to the LBC Boutique and Loan lombard in Somerville, Massachusetts, a lombard worker offered only $50 for the instrument that looked old and unrepresentable.
But experienced store manager Dylan McDermitt suspected that it was an old and expensive tool, and sought advice from an expert.
It was discovered that the violin was made in 1759 by the famous Italian violinist Ferdinand Galliano and is valued at $ 250,000.
Smoothies to the violin are estimated at $ 16-18 thousand.
The investigation revealed that the violin was stolen from one of the inhabitants of the city, and the instrument was returned to the legitimate owner.
It is not known how the violin reached the man who handed it over to the lombard, but there are no previous clashes with the law behind it.
The manager says that now everyone bringing the violin to the lombard will be asked to play it to make sure it really belongs to the client.
In the ninth round of the RPL we are waiting for an exciting confrontation: "Spartak" will take on its stadium in Tushin "Rostov" under the leadership of Valery Karpin - a man, as you know, is not alien to the "people's team".
Particular picantity to this meeting is given by the fact that the clubs now have an equal number of points - 15 each, and they share 3 and 4 places in the tournament table, lagging behind the far-flung "Zenit" and being in one point from "Krasnodar", which tomorrow plays with "Dynamo".
The red-and-white have a difficult track now: the club is again surrounded by idiotic scandals, in the Europa League, the team of Massimo Carrera unexpectedly flew to Rapida, and recently ceded home to Akhmatou.
After the derby with the CSKA, which ended in a fair draw, "Spartak" with a minimal score and not without difficulty defeated in the "Black Sea" Cup, and it is still too early to talk about whether the most popular club of Russia is approaching to get out of the crisis.
"Rostov" could not win three matches in a row, but he knows no defeats here already five matches.
Let’s see if Carpin can extend the losing series with such a fundamental match for himself.
The previous meeting of Karpinsk "Rostov" with "Spartak" ended in favor of the capital team.
The start is at 19:00.

London blasts accusations against Moscow
Russia is trying to rewrite the results of the Cold War, said British Defense Minister Gavin Williamson.
But England will defend its values, he stressed during a speech at the Congress of the ruling Conservative Party in Birmingham.
Threats are growing, Iran and North Korea are becoming more dangerous, and enemies are acting in the grey zones through cyber attacks and fake news, the minister added.
But the largest of them is Russia, which is increasing its military presence in Ukraine and the Arctic region.
Such statements of Western politicians Moscow has repeatedly denied, reports TASS.
At the same time, British Foreign Minister Jeremy Hunt said that Russia would have to pay a high price if it would not abide by international rules and use chemical weapons.
Hunt mentioned the story of the poisoning in the English city of Salisbury in March this year of the former GRU colonel Sergei Skripal, convicted of espionage for the benefit of the UK, and his daughter Julia.
The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia is holding a referendum on joining the EU and NATO on the condition of changing the name of the country.
The referendum is aimed at resolving a 27-year dispute with neighboring Greece over the name of the country, which coincides with the name of the neighboring Greek province.
One of the first to vote was Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, a fierce supporter of the republic's name change to North Macedonia.
International organizations are monitoring the preparations for the referendum and today’s vote.
Jan Petersen, head of the Bureau for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights observation mission, told Euronews how the observers’ work was organized:
Around 100 teams traveled across the country today to monitor the entire process, from the opening of polling stations to their closure, then counting the votes and drawing up the minutes.
Over the course of the month, 10 of our teams worked in the country, which monitored the preparation for voting, the work of the media, the observance of the law on the financing of electoral campaigns and the organization of a referendum.
Faye Dolgeri: “About 500 foreign observers are closely monitoring the vote.
Groups of observers record in detail what is happening and communicate with members of the election commissions to then present them in the final report.
A translator compares the mentality of Russians and Germans
The mentality of the Russian and German peoples is different, but the few differences between them do not play a big role in mutual understanding.
This was stated by professional translator-synchronist Barbel Saxe on the International Day of the Translator on September 30.
She has been translating from Russian and English for over 30 years.
"The Germans like to plan events quietly, and the Russians, as the proverb says, "shut down for a long time, and they go quickly."
But it seems to me that for mutual understanding between peoples and for the work of the translator this does not play a significant role," the specialist said in a commentary to "RIA Novosti".
According to the translator, to understand that two countries cannot do without each other, "it is enough to know the history."
And in the future, Saxe noted, Germany has no point in ignoring Russia.
Russia is a natural part of Europe, there is no point in trying to ignore it.
We need Russian gas, oil, there are many things that determine our common destiny,” she said.
The day before, German Chancellor Angela Merkel said that the country is trying to "bind relations" with Russia and support them.
According to her, the project of the Nord Stream-2 gas pipeline, which is being built from the coast of Russia to Germany along the bottom of the Baltic Sea, is important for Berlin's mania.

Comedy "Evening School" Leads American Box Office
The comedy "Evening School", which debuted in American cinemas last Friday, earned $28 million for its first weekend in the box office.
Such a result allowed the uncomplicated picture with Kevin Hart and Tiffany Hadis in the main roles to head the box office of the United States for September 28-30.
On the international market, the film, so far released only in 20 countries, raised $5.5 million, including 2 million from British viewers.
In the struggle for the first line, the creation of Malcolm Lee, which remarkably, quite tangibly outperformed another novice of the western rental - cartoon "Smolfoot", a curious story of the acquaintance of a charming yeti with a representative of the human race, in the existence of which the main character never believed.
The project, directed by Cary Kirkpatrick and Jason Reissig, raised $23 million for their start-up weekend, in general, fulfilling the expectations of experts, who predicted the film 20-25 million per weekend.
As for the total fees of Smolfoot, they currently amount to $38.6 million (while he debuted in 50 countries): the most active here was Mexico, which added the treasury of the film by 3.6 million.
Three of the strongest this time closed the children's fairy tale "The Secret of the House with Clocks" from the master of horror Elia Rota, which finally proved that the director can do a quality movie and for the audience of 12+.
For its second week in the box office, the screenplay of John Bellers's book with the charming Jack Black and Kate Blanchett earned $ 12.5 million, bringing the total worldwide revenue to 53.8 million.
Despite the departure from the top 3, continues to surprise with the sign "+" thriller with Blake Lively and Anna Kendrick "Simple Prayer": for 17 days in the American rental the painting of Paul Fig, from which some unrealistic financial accomplishments initially did not expect from the word "totally", collected $43 million (including $6.6 million for October 28-30) and right now has up to 62.9 million total revenue.
The last representative of the top five this week was the horror "The Curse of the nuns", which raised $5.4 million in the reporting period.
The spin-off "The Curse" for 24 days in American (and not only, of course) cinemas has a total earnings of $330 million and has recently proudly held the title of the most successful film of the franchise, which also includes two parts of the "The Curse" and two films about the terrible doll Annabel.
Directly following the horror Corina Hardy last weekend was another representative of the genre - the debut "Hallfest", one of the main youth horrors of the year.
In his first weekend, the childhood of the famous assembler (and recent director) Gregory Plotkin, who previously worked in a number of major horror projects, including "Happy Day of Death", to which "Hallfest" places very similar, earned $5.1 million in the United States.
Given the modest budget of the film, the result is extremely positive.
Seventh were "Crazy Rich Asians" ($4.15 million), which, it seems, and do not think to fall out of the top 10 of the American box office: a romantic comedy, living on the screens for the seventh week, according to the results of September is the sixth in the ranking of the most cash-track of the genre for the entire history with a figure of 165.7 million.
This is the amount that the painting has earned in the domestic market at the moment - the total revenue of the tape is 218.8 million.
As for the last three lucky players, who were in the tenth place in the U.S. for September 28-30, they became the Predator, the White Guy Rick and the "Bug Mint", who earned $ 3.7 million, 2.38 million and 1.1 million for the past weekend, respectively.
We will add that the next weekend in the United States will all gather the long-awaited "Venom" with Tom Hardy, who - this can be doubted - without special problems will take over the leadership in the American boxing office at the end of the first weekend of October.
Among the other premiere next week is to highlight the musical-melodrama "Star is Born", the winner of the Venice Film Festival by Bradley Cooper, and the criminal drama "Your Hate".

Valery Belov: God helped “Siberia” today
Chief coach "Vityazya" Valery Belov - about defeat from "Siberia" (3:4) in the match of the regular championship of the KHL.
“A colleague spoke about Siberian fans, and I want to note our fans,” Belov said on the official website of Vityazya.
“I hope they will support as well, because now almost every game is a full stadium, a great atmosphere.
In the game,, the Lord helped Siberia today, because they were very grossly mistaken, especially our leaders.
In general, our leading leaders lost the micro-match 0:3 so it was difficult for us to pull out this match, although there were moments.
Nevertheless, I will take the blame on myself.
Because they probably missed something in preparation.
Compared to the previous match, it was a different team.
“It’s a ugly cowardice.”
Audiences outraged by the choice of Agutin on the show "Voice"
The viewers of the show "Voice 60+" accuse mentor Leonid Agutin of "disgraceful cumming and rattling."
When in the blind auditions he recognized the voice of his father Nicholas Agutin from the first notes, many hoped that he would remain neutral and would not turn to the performer.
But the son’s feelings took over, and he chose a relative to his team.
Then many considered it a joke, but forgave the mentor the unobjectivity at the first stage.
But the "joke" was delayed, and the star's father absolutely unjustifiably took the place of more worthy performers.
And now the spectators are not ready to forgive Agustin such injustice.
Yesterday, we, the viewers of the show, were outraged by the ugly and sincere dragging of our close relatives to the final staircase.
I even doubted that Agutina would have enough strength and conscience not to drag his father to the end already to the first place," Irina Petrovskaya and Ksenia Larina argued in the program "Man from the TV".
Meanwhile, for his father's sake, Leonid Agutin "fused" beautiful performers who really sang, while Nikolai Petrovich whispered a touching song about his mother, explaining this by the fact that the audience still wants to see in his father's show.
But, as it turned out, this is not the case at all, the audience wants an objective assessment and see really talented performers in the final, and now Agutin has discredited the show.
“I feel sympathy with the participants of the Voice from the Agutin team – they were doomed.”
Last time Agutin showed how much he loves his dad, and today he should have been a professional.
“The contest has lost its meaning.”
"To remove two talented people from the project and leave in the project a dad who doesn't sing but whispers, how can you then call a mentor?"
“You like how Daddy sings, arrange a concert for him in the Kremlin for your money and see how many people will come to that concert.”
This is the “Voice” show, not the “Cruel relatives” show.
“From Agustin’s side, it was unprofessional.”
"Then you have to offer your dad to perform on your own show, not on a show that is made for the money of Channel One."
“It was a real chance for someone, and he took someone’s place.
And I don’t understand why a silent dad should be more understandable to me than any other participant with real vocal data.
Why was the worker from Surgut with a magnificent voice and timbre merged, and Pope Agutin brought to the final?
And then we all complain that the same faces have been on the stage and on the screen for decades!
Because you don’t get through the crowd!”
“What were you waiting for?
This is Russia!
Around the blade and cuddle.
The money in the family budget is not too much.
The theatre of absurdity continues!
Users also remembered that in one of the seasons of the traditional "Voice" on blind listening came out the son of Gradsky.
Then the meter and in the head did not come to take his son into his own team.
Moreover, he said, “Let’s go from here, everything is clear.”
Agustin did not act as a professional.

The scientist told about the possible scientific program of the Russian expedition to the moon
The head of the Institute of Space Studies of the Russian Academy of Sciences, member-correspondent of the Russian Academy of Sciences Anatoly Petrukovich told RIA Novosti about a possible program of scientific research for Russian astronauts on the moon.
According to him, the scientific community is currently developing directions of such work.
"There is no consolidated opinion yet," the scientist stressed.
He noted that one option is to place a low-frequency radio telescope on the back of the moon, which would avoid interference, the source of which is the Earth.
"This is the only place where such a telescope can be deployed to study cosmic radiation sources," Petrovich added.
He also believes that the moon could be used for testing robotics, using local resources for construction.
In addition, astronauts should be attracted to the search for primitive organics on Earth's satellite, the scientist believes.
This could help determine how life appears on the planets.
Earlier, the head of the corporation "Roskosmos" said that in the optimistic version of the Russian Federation could carry out a manned flight to the moon by 2030.

Damian Simms, a 41-year-old resident of St. Petersburg (Florida), who is called, "had a tooth" on the 24-hour store manager of the 7-Eleven network: in May, he expelled him from the store for inappropriate behavior.
He decided to take revenge on his enemy in an original way.
In the middle of the second night he went into the store and dropped the contents of the basket brought with him on the floor and on some of the goods on the shelves.
The basket contained feces and urine, which Simms “borrowed” from a nearby mobile bio-toilet.
Police who arrived at the scene arrested the “venger.”
He was put in jail and released before trial under a bail of $300.
He was charged with illegal intrusion into someone else’s property and criminal offence, as well as prohibited from entering the store and approaching the manager.

Sergey Sirotkin: I couldn’t do anything, and it was very painful
Russian pilot of Williams Sergey Sirotkin commented on the outcome of the race of the Grand Prix of Russia.
“Honestly, I don’t really want to talk about what’s in my head.
I had a good start, and in the second turn I found myself between two cars, which immediately hit me.
I lost all the positions I played at the start, instantly.
He was in a very bad position.
Trapped in traffic.
We hoped that after the rest will go to the pit stop, we will get into the "clean air", and the pace will return, but the rubber was no longer there.
Plus, he fought with his partner, he also had contact with him.
As I understand, he was a little mistaken.
We found ourselves in this situation on the season’s hardest track, I couldn’t do anything, and it was very painful, to be honest.
I don’t want to talk about it anymore,” Sirotkin told RIA Novosti.
Sirotkin in the race at the Grand Prix of Russia finished 18th, the winner was British "Mercedes" pilot Lewis Hamilton.
Tarpishev called it absurd to remove Glushakov and Yeshchenko from the foundation of "Spartak"
President of the Federation of Tennis of Russia (FTR) Shamil Tarpishchev commented on the removal of the footballers of the Moscow "Spartak" Denis Glushakov and Andrey Yeshchenko from training with the main composition after a love to criticism of the head coach of the team Massimo Carrera, reports "Sport weekend".
Carrera’s actions were absolutely absurd.
Paying attention to such things is foolish.
I totally disagree with what Carrer is doing.
This only increases the disorder in the team.
First, these are poems, you can read and perceive them as you want.
I’t have reacted to that in Carrera’s place.
Everyone has their opinion.
Everyone wants to be buried.
If Glushakov and Yeshchenko put likes, it doesn’t mean they have something against the coach.
I think the Italian lack the flexibility to perceive the situation.
This does not serve the normal atmosphere in the team.
Today, "Spartak" has no game, so this situation did not need to blow up at all.
Maybe we should have laughed at this together.
"Spartak" has a lot of things wrong in different lines, there is a disagreement after the introduction to the youth.
Relationships within the team, apparently, do not add optimism before this match," Tarbishchev said.
The match between the two teams will take place on September 30 and will begin at 19:00 Moscow time.
John Terry, who previously rejected Spartak, headed the youth team of Chelsea.
Sirius educators discussed with scientists nature-like technologies
Educators of the educational center "Sirius" in Sochi, participants of the School of Agrobiology and Plant Genetics, attended a lecture by scientists of the national research center "Kurchatov Institute".
The researchers’ speech was held within the framework of the program of the Global International Forum of Convergence and Nature-Like Technologies, organized in Sochi on behalf of Russian President Vladimir Putin, according to the website of the educational center on September 29.
The lecture was opened by the documentary film “Kurchatov’s Codes”, during which the President of the Kurchatov Institute, member-correspondent of the Russian Academy of Sciences Mikhail Kovalchuk spoke about global challenges as the driving force of civilization development.
The lecture of the scientist is published on the site "Sirius".
Students learned that modern technology requires huge amounts of energy.
Alternative energy is not yet capable of producing such amounts.
To solve this problem, according to the organizers of the forum, will help nature-like technologies, which today young scientists are working on.
In addition, Kovalchuk raised the topic of responsibility for the development of nature-like technologies, and also talked about the risks that inevitably arise when creating such technologies.
"The arrival of such technologies is a unique thing, it is a colossal good.
This is the explosive growth of medical technology, it is the improvement of quality of life and infrastructure.
But there is also the second side.
The development of nature-like technologies is actually the technological reproduction of living nature systems.
There is a reverse side - a targeted intervention in human life.
There is always risk.
A car appeared - people began to die under the wheels.
The cars are still used.
The dual nature of technology.
I’m creating medical new technology, and at the same time I can create weapons of mass destruction,” the scientist said.
After watching the film and discussing modern scientific breakthroughs, students were able to ask questions to the participants of the meeting.
In the role of speakers, the candidate of physical and mathematical sciences, the head of the Kurchatov complex of NBIX-natural-like technologies of the NIC "Kurchatov Institute" Yulia Djakov and the head of the Kurchatov complex of NBIX-technologies Vyacheslav Demin.
The “Sirius” educational center in Sochi was created by the “Talent and Success” educational foundation on the basis of the Olympic infrastructure at the initiative of Russian President Vladimir Putin.
The aim of the educational center is the early identification, development and further professional support of gifted children.
Earlier in September it was that the prize-winners of the All-Russian online Olympiad on information security "Cybervisov" will be sent to training in "Sirius".

Russian submarine Kazan scared the United States
The greatest danger to the U.S. Navy is the Russian submarine Kazan.
This was stated by U.S. counteradmiral Dave Johnson, reports "Rosbalt" with reference to The National Interest.

Macedonia: Referendum not held due to low participation
The referendum was aimed at approving the agreement of the authorities in Athens and Skopje on changing the name of the Balkan country to "Northern Macedonia".
Greece opposed the use of the name of its historic province by the Macedonians.

But, as the agency EFE reports, only 34% of the appearance on Sunday's plebiscite "did not reach" the constitutional threshold of 50%.
However, since the referendum was only consultative, it is possible that the authorities in Skopje will decide not to refuse the renaming.
Speaking shortly after the closure of the polling stations, Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, a supporter of the republic's name change, said that if there are more "yes" among the votes, Macedonia will change the name, despite the unreached quorum.

Kermerovchan outraged a herd of bears at the cemetery
On September 30, on the famous Kemerovskaya page in the social network appeared a message from an eyewitness that in one of the local cemeteries are freely walking horned animals.
Animals with a large herd passed between the fence and sprinkled grass.
The commentators expressed different opinions: someone from the local residents noted that there is no harm in the presence of small cattle on the cemetery, and their appetite may even help in cleaning the territory from weeds and grasses, but some of the inhabitants of the city did not like the behavior of animals:
“This is a grave, not a pasture.
There is nothing to do with the bears.
Of course, you will not say that the sheep are wretched, but it is not the case." (the style is preserved) - said the indignant Kemerovchanka in her message.
Anyway, one of the eyewitnesses noted that the problem in the form of animals in the middle of the cemetery is already known, and the necessary measures will soon be taken.
Pressing and pushing – how is it right?
The word pressure does not exist.
Right to bring.
The word "press" in the meaning of "weigh, influence, influence" exists only phonetically, because we hear the sound [a] instead of [o] in the word "tough".
We use this word, assuming it comes from the word “pressure.”
But “pressure” and “pull” are not only etimologically not close, but even in some sense opposite.
Convince yourself of it.
To satisfy (church-book, obsolete) - means "enough, full, sufficient, to be sufficient for someone or something, to satisfy."
To be satisfied, pleasure are related words.
Previously, he still had the meaning of "not dependent on anything, having self-sufficient significance" - "to satisfy yourself."
The Old Slavic "devoti" is related to the words "to command" and "will".
Pressing and suppressing is different.
These words have truly frightening "relatives": daos - "wolf" (pressing sheep), deyja - "die" and dvaidī - "pressure".
The similar phonetic appearance of the words “pressure” and “enough”, as well as the inevitable obsolescence of the latter, forced them to enter into contamination.
Thus we have this very "d" which is used in writing through "a", which is, in good faith, wrong and impossible from the point of view of the processes of the origin and development of these words.
It is right to bring.
But this word is obsolete, in its proper meaning no longer used.
If you want to note that any circumstances/people are having a negative impact on you from above, use the word “press.”
You can also use the "pressure" design, but remember that this is the office.

They must be there in total darkness, without light, but we could only support them with words.
I am a simple volunteer and I only want one thing – to save lives.

A friendly man gave a baby an exclusive parking lot - magazine
Miracles happen in our lives!
This was by German journalist Christy Dietz on Twitter.
She wrote on her page that her four-year-old son had parked his runway (a pedal-free bicycle) around the same lighthouse for a year.
And one morning a cute sticker appeared on the column with a photo of a green bicycle and the inscription: "Only for him."
The enthusiasm of the mother and child had no limits.
Christie thanked the anonymous benevolent and praised him for an interesting and fresh idea.
Her tweet quickly spread across the social network and made a lot of people smile.
The comments on him were also wonderful:
“How wonderful it is!”
“Thank you for the wonderful communication in this world.”
“I think there are a lot of people in the world capable of doing this.”
“Unfortunately, they do not attract the same attention as the outputs of fools.”
“This is the world we need!”
Readers asked the journalist, if she suddenly managed to find out who was the author of this idea, to tell about it.
After all, this person, apparently, somewhere nearby: he not once watched the baby park, once this came to his mind.
He really deserves a place in Formula 1.
Russian driver Mikhail Aleshin - about the return of compatriot Daniel Kvyat to Formula 1 as a driver of "Toro Rosso".
I think this is just great news: there will be another Russian driver in Formula 1, and it will be Danya.
I think he really deserves this place, and he’s not saying everything in Formula One yet.
Yes, often not everything went as it should, and I think he has not even realized part of his potential yet.
It will be interesting to watch his performances in the coming year", - said Aleshina SMP Racing.

With the help of the operation in Syria, Russia protected itself from terrorists
During the three years of the Russian military operation in Syria, about 100 thousand terrorists were killed, of which 85 thousand terrorists were destroyed by the Russian Aerospace Forces.
This was stated in connection with the third anniversary of the beginning of the Russian military operation in Syria by the former head of the Air Force, the head of the Federation Council Committee on Defense and Security Viktor Bondarev.
He noted the high accuracy of the use of airborne weapons: the Air and Space Forces have carried out and continue to carry out all strikes precisely on the objects of the terrorists.
According to Bondarev, in three years in Syria destroyed tens of thousands of terrorist objects - we are talking, for example, ammunition warehouses, fortifications and headquarters.
With the help of Russian airstrikes, the defense of the jihadists was hacked - this was a decisive contribution to the advancement of Syrian government troops, reports Interfax.
At the same time, according to Bondarev, the operation of our military in Syria allowed to protect Russia itself from terrorists, many of whom had Russian passports.
At the beginning of the operation in Syria, more than two-thirds of the territory of the Arab Republic was controlled by terrorist groups, including Islamic State (ISIS, banned in Russia) and Jebhat-an-Nusra ( banned in Russia).
According to the General Staff of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation, on the side of the Islamic State fought about four thousand militants from among Russian citizens and about five thousand citizens of post-Soviet countries.
And we are only talking about registered persons, not counting those who were not identified, Bondarev stressed.
Most of them were trained and ready at any time to take arms in their hands, and Russian passports gave them the right to freely enter our country.
Thus, Bondarev noted, in Syria, Russia is fighting international terrorism at distant borders - otherwise this evil "would slip to us."

Syria accuses US of supporting terrorism
Syrian Foreign Minister Walid Muallem has accused the United States and its partners of war crimes in Syria and support of terrorism.
The [Western] coalition has completely destroyed the Syrian city of Raqqa, it has destroyed infrastructure and public services in the areas against which its actions were directed, it has committed mass murders of civilians, including children and women.
These killings are war crimes under international law,” he said.
According to Muallem, the U.S. and its partners provided "direct support to the terrorists", as the objectives of the militants and the Western coalition in Syria coincided and meant "seeding chaos, death and destruction on their way."
The foreign minister also noted that the fight against terrorists in Syria is almost complete, and the country has become safer and more stable.
Muallem added that Damascus also intends to clear Syria from illegal foreign presence, and the priority in the country's restoration will be given to Syrian partners.
In September, the head of the Russian Center for the Reconciliation of the Conflicting Parties in the Republic, Lieutenant-General Vladimir Savchenko, said that two American F-15s hit the Syrian province of Deir ez-Zor with banned phosphorus ammunition.
The United States has denied all accusations.
Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko believes that while respecting the sovereignty of other states, Ukraine has the right to demand the same respect for its own sovereignty.
This was stated by the head of state during a trip to the Kharkiv region, commenting on the issue of Hungary’s passports in the Transcarpathian region.
Protecting Ukrainian citizens, I defend the sovereignty of our state.
Just as we respect the sovereignty of other states, we demand the same respect for Ukraine,” Poroshenko said.
According to Poroshenko, he as president will protect Ukrainian citizens, wherever they are - in the east or in the west of the country.
At the same time, the head of state supported the position of the Foreign Ministry in the passport scandal with Hungary, which is intended to expel the consul of this country from Beregovo.
"I fully share every letter that the Foreign Ministry has said," the President noted.
On September 19, a video appeared on the network, which recorded the moment of issuing Hungarian passports to citizens of Ukraine at the Consulate of Hungary in Bregovo.
At the same time, they vowed allegiance to Hungary.
Minister of Foreign Affairs of Ukraine Pavel Klimkin noted that the consul of Hungary, who appears on the video with the distribution of Ukrainian passports, should leave the territory of Ukraine either by the decision of Budapest itself, or will be expelled by Kiev.
The Prosecutor’s Office of the Transcarpathian Region opened a criminal case on the issue of Hungarian passports.
The incident was classified under the article "State betrayal".
Putin arrived in Siberia
It is known that the last two days Vladimir Putin spent in Dushanbe, where he took part in the work of the Council of the CIS States, and also held a number of bilateral meetings with presidents of neighbouring countries.
Data on flights of the Russian "boat No. 1" on the site Flightradar indicate that around 6 o'clock in the evening on Tajikistan time on September 28 Il-96-300 flew from the airport of Dushanbe and took its course to the northeast.

However, on September 21, Zimin withdrew his candidacy.
In the upcoming tour together with Konovalov must take part Andrei Filagin ("Just Russia").
The Khazak media suggests that Putin may accept the resignation of the leader of Khazakia and appoint a new vio of the head of the republic, as well as to make a decision on the fate of Zimin.

More than 10 million Syrians have become refugees since the beginning of the armed conflict in Syria for seven years.
About five million people fled to other countries, mainly neighbouring Turkey, Lebanon and Jordan.
Now, according to Damascus, the military action is close to completion, and the country is ready for the voluntary return of refugees.
Syrian Foreign Minister Walid al-Muallem said in a speech at the UN: “The situation on the ground has now become more stable and safe thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism.
The government continues the reconstruction work in the areas destroyed by the terrorists, bringing them back to normal life.
All conditions have been created for the voluntary return of Syrian refugees to the country they had to leave due to terrorism and unilateral economic sanctions that complicated people’s lives and deprived them of their means of subsistence.
The Syrian authorities also called on the international community to facilitate the return of refugees and allocate funds for this.
Meanwhile, the United States and the European Union refuse to provide aid to Syria, saying that a political solution to the conflict must first be found.
Volkswagen fully admitted its guilt in the “dieselgate” in January 2017.
In December last year, Oliver Schmidt, one of the managers of the American division of the company, was sentenced to seven years in prison.
The loss of the group is estimated at least 25 billion euros.
This amount includes not only fines and compensations.
By June of next year, the automaker is obliged to buy back or repair 85% of the cars involved in the scandal.
In February, the company’s management said the commitments had already been met for 83% of vehicles, so the program would be completed early.
Volkswagen is making every effort to compensate for the losses and regain the trust of customers.
So, recently, the management of the group has changed again, and it has also been announced about a large-scale restructuring and fundamental changes in the management system.
Moreover, Volkswagen promises to buy even new cars if German cities ban diesel on their streets: such a right authorities received in February this year.

Metropolitan Hilarion compared the decision of Kiev to rename the UOC with the actions of the fascists
The head of the Synodal Department of External Church Relations of the Russian Orthodox Church Metropolitan Hilarion compared the renaming of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of the Moscow Patriarchate to the Russian Church in Ukraine with the actions of the fascists against Jews.
“It’s the same as in fascist Germany to strike a yellow star on Jews, it means to mark the Church as an enemy organization, and it’s for this purpose that this bill was created,” the Metropolitan said on the TV channel “Russia-24”.
According to him, this step will have the most serious consequences right now, when the Russian-Ukrainian conflict is in an acute stage.
Kiev thus hopes to gain full control over the UOC and “put it out of the law,” the priest believes.
“This is the Ukrainian church, and the believers of this church consider themselves Ukrainians, they are patriots of their country,” he added.
Deputies of the Verkhovna Rada are working on the implementation of bills No. 4128 (on the change of the subordination of religious communities), No. 4511 (on the special status of religious organizations) and No. 5309 (on the change of the name of religious organizations).
The latter suggests the renaming of the UOC of the Moscow Patriarchate.
The deputy of the Pochaev Lavra called for the protection of Orthodoxy and Ukrainian holy places
Metropolitan Vladimir, deputy of the St. Uspensky Pochaev Lavra, appealed to protect the Orthodox faith and Ukrainian shrines.
The text of his appeal to the believers of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church (UPC) was published on the website of the monastery.
At different times in history, our predecessors and Christians of faith and spirit had to profess their faith and defend their sanctuaries.
Given the situation that has emerged, and the information that we have, and the threats of raids that are spreading, it is clear that we will have to experience something," Metropolitan said.
He asked for support – prayer, moral.
Also, the deputy laurel stressed that, probably, "will need your physical presence."
The priest added: "Lenin's grandchildren - in spirit, threaten to be executed, and therefore we will defend our sanctuary."
Who is not indifferent to the fate of the Pochaev Lavra – the Orthodox Ukrainian and world holy place, must be ready to protect it.
The Metropolitan called not to go to the cause of those who mislead believers.
The UOC has the canonical status determined by the Tomos of 29 October 1990 from the Mother Church.
And now someone wants to become dependent on the news patriarch and friend of the Roman Catholic Pope, Bartholomew.
The new style with its consequences is unacceptable to us Orthodox.
And we are satisfied with the status that our church has,” said the deputy of the Lavra.
He recalled that the UOC since October 1990 is canonically independent and completely independent in its management.
There is no administrative and financial accountability of the Moscow Patriarchate.
In fact, Tomos our church already has.
What other Tomos do we need?” – said Metropolitan Vladimir Pochaevsky, urging believers and all citizens to ask whether other confessions have Tomos, are they independent of the Vatican?
The believers to some extent understood and decided which temple they would go to.
However, somebody wants to sow hostility and discord again.
Some are envious that the dome shines on the temples that they want to destroy,” he said.
The Pochaev Lavra is the largest temple complex and monastery in Western Ukraine.
It is located on the top of the Pochaevsky mountain, 70 kilometers from Ternopil.
The first historical records relate to the beginning of the 13th century.

I liked the first period.
I didn’t use a few good moments.
In the second half, the opponent squeezed us a little, we stood up.
But the removal “feed” us a little.
The guys played great, performed the training set.
I think if we continue to play right, the victories will come.

We will be lucky if we continue to play in that direction.”

In the pre-season, the team solved other tasks, a lot of young guys played.
I think there was a completely different game, a different hockey.
The driver is a good team.
From the tournament table it is clear that the team is playing correctly.
Good hockey, good atmosphere in the arena and in the city.
You can only wish them good luck.
The team is moving in the right direction.
There are a lot of good players, there are leaders.
Good defense, good goalkeeper.
It was hard, we were preparing.
We knew the team was going without defeat, they wanted to break it, but it didn’t work.”

U.S. increases opiate production in Afghanistan
About the sharp worsening of the situation in Afghanistan on September 26, much was spoken in Tehran.
There were multilateral consultations with the participation of Iran, India, China, Afghanistan and Russia, which was represented by the Secretary of the Security Council Nikolai Patrushev.
In fact, on Afghan territory, the militants unleashed a real terrorist war against state authorities and the civilian population of the country.
The current year has become a record for the number of bloody terrorist attacks, as a result of which thousands of ordinary Afghans were killed," Patrushev said.
The conflict in Afghanistan did not begin yesterday.
After the attacks of September 11, 2001, the main enemy of the United States was declared the terrorist group "Al-Qaeda" (prohibited in the Russian Federation), which settled in Afghanistan.
Not a month has passed since America and its NATO allies launched the military operation “Unbreakable Freedom” there.
17 years have passed.
Thousands of American troops are still on Afghan soil.
And peaceful life is even more ghostly than it was then.
U.S. troops are driven beyond the fence of dozens of their bases.
As they can, they are redeemed from the militants for money - only if they were not touched.
The government of Afghanistan controls a smaller portion of the country – 40 percent, according to Patrushev.
50% - from the Taliban movement (forbidden in the Russian Federation).
Another 10% - for ISIS terrorists (forbidden in the Russian Federation).
But they grow there quickly.
The goal is to create a barbaric pseudo-caliphate in Central Asia – exactly what they failed in Iraq and Syria.
America seems to be satisfied.
In the 17 years of American presence, the production of opiates in Afghanistan has increased by at least 40 times.
Colossal growth in opium-macked areas and multi-billion-dollar profits.
Macedonians are preparing to vote in a referendum on joining the EU and NATO on the condition of changing the name of the country.
The agreement to rename the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia to the Republic of North Macedonia was reached on June 17 as a result of long negotiations with neighboring Greece, which refused to recognize its northern neighbor the right to be called Macedonia, seeing in such a name an attempt on the same-name Greek province and Greek history.
Lupko Petkovsky, a political scientist, said: “Thanks to this agreement, Macedonia or North Macedonia gets the right to a better future, hope for social change.
Greece has a right to its past.
There are no ideal agreements.
They arise as a result of difficult compromises that can’t make absolutely everyone happy.”
The name change is supported by the ruling Social Democrats headed by Prime Minister Zoran Zaev.
Conservative opposition and President of the country Georgi Ivanov.
According to journalist Cvetin Chilimanov, Macedonia has no point in joining the EU - it is enough to have a partnership with him: "Many of those who do not like the agreement believe that the current socialist government headed by Zaev is forced from the outside to change the name of the country.
But this decision will have negative consequences.
First of all, loss of sovereignty.
Obviously, there are countries that would not want Macedonia to remain one of the sovereign countries in the Balkans.”
Fei Dulgeri, Euronews: “The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia is facing the biggest challenge in its history.
The country is at a crossroads.
The choice made by the citizens of Macedonia will determine the future not only of the Balkans, but of Europe as a whole.”
